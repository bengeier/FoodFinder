{"text":"The Isthmus recommended them as a classic example of the Wisconsin tavern experience.  

Basically - it's an old house by the highway that's been turned into a bar.  They've got a grill behind the bar, and lots of locals.  There's also some seating and they will wait on you.  Our cheerful and friendly waitress recommended the German burger.  She made this recommendation as she was bringing out some other peoples' German burgers, sticking the plates under our noses and saying \"German burger, you'll love em.  They're the best.\"  I remember seething, bubbling cheese, and my eyes watering as the kraut vapors encountered my retinas.  My companion may have sneezed.  

Well - who could resist after that?  So German burger it was.  

Was it any good?  Who gives a fuck.  Probably not.  But we were determined to get our Wisconsin on, and we did just that.  

OH YAAAAH"}
{"text":"I grew up in Madison in the 60's and early 70's, and while most of us cannot think of one good memory from Junior High, Tony Franks is mine.

While I will grant you that nostalgia is probably worth 2 of the 5 starts I am giving this place, I would like you to know that I recently visited twice in four days, both times at lunch.  The burgers were everything I remembered, the beer was ice cold, and I wish I could go back again today.  Living 600 miles away is the only reason I'm not a regular.

This is the quintessential Wisconsin tavern experience.  The only way it gets better is to road trip to somewhere along the Chippewa River and find a dive bar full of farmers and fishermen."}
{"text":"Food is always good here but it's a little over priced. A standard burger with fries and a soda will be over $10 for one person not to mention the cost of adding toppings to the burger."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a 5 star but the price held me back. I have to say that the burger was the best I have had in Madison or the surrounding area! Simply wonderful and done to perfection! This is a REAL burger nothing pressed here. The service was amazing! I took a couple of my employees for lunch and they both loved their burgers as well. Like I said I was bit surprised by the bill but I would go back it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely best place for a burger in madison!  I've been here numerous times and they never let us down. It's a small place with an old tavern feel. The bar seats maybe 20, there's also limited table seating...either option gets busy for dinner. Bar selection is average nothing really stands out here, the burgers are definitely the highlight. Give this place a try if you haven't yet...its our go to for burgers!"}
{"text":"i always wanted to check out the kitschy old house transformed into a bar, but never made my way inside... that is, until this weekend.  i have to say, i was impressed!  the burgers were awesome. the place seemed clean.  service was great, even though the place was packed (badger game day).  i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of stopping by on a weekend afternoon during the middle of a game... Not an available seat in the place. Placed my order at the bar and sat down on the window sill (yes that is correct) and chomped down on a double bacon cheeseburger. 

The people and place were great but the food was average. I don't have any desires to return. Perhaps a bar chaser would enjoy the atmosphere more as they definitely cater to spirit chaser given the large bar area. If you are looking for some insight in that regard, I'm sure my fellow yelpers have posted several divining reviews on that subject."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, it is my understanding that Tony franks is closed.  It is a shame because it was a great bar with very good food.  The service and amenities have gone downhill the last year however.  Hopefully someone will buy the business and bring it back to its former glory.  It is a Wisconsin classic and deserves to be resurrected!"}
{"text":"Used to stop in here all the time for a decent burger. After a long hiatus and reading some favorable reviews, I went in again last week. Big disappointment...asked for medium rare, got a grey, dry well done. They advertise Knoche's meat, but this thing was pre-formed and skinny. I don't think so. Half order of frozen overcooked onion rings, yuck. Lousy service as well. Should have gone down to the Village, Blue Moon, or Plaza where I'm never disappointed. Off my list for good."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's definitely a local hangout and the service is very friendly.  It's not a fancy place at all.  The menu consists of typical pub grub.  I love their burgers.  It gets really crowded on game days and at 5 on weekdays."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of weeks ago. It was small but cute inside. Burgers were decent and the waitstaff was pleasant and efficient. I read yelp reviews before I try a place and was surprised at some of the negative comments. Overall it was a good experience and I would go back."}
{"text":"I refrained from giving a review the first two times.  After all some waitresses have a bad day. But three times? All three times it was the same.  Service was slow, and I agree with some folks giving reviews,  waitress was rude and gave the best service. ...to her friends.  All three times. Our service was slow and the waitress seemed bothered by having to explain the menu and beer selection.   Burgers were mediocre.  Certainty not worth the price. This is a great place if you are a regular. Terrible if you are a casual diner.  I DO NOT PLAN ON RETURNING. Such a shame too for a long time Madison business."}
{"text":"Decent food for a bar.  Very small place so you have no choice but to listen to the idiots at the bar.  Service was OK."}
{"text":"Dive bar tour took us here for the covered out door searing. The place seemed nice and not divvy at all, it was a last minute decision to stop here.

The food must be ok here because family's were filling the out door seating. They have a good selection of tap beers and something for everyone. It's a nice place to hang out and have some drinks. 

The men's room was a bit strange because it has unusual art on the walls, see my pictures."}
{"text":"It is hard to believe I have not reviewed Tony Franks.   I do not go there often but I do enjoy the place.

Lets put it this way...Tony Franks is a bar located in a house that serves great food and unbelievable burgers and have been since before dirt was invented.

The staff is generally always friendly and great (you may catch an occasional off day where the regular staff is not here and the backups just do not cut the mustard) and the small \"cheers\" feel is awesome.   What a great place to chill, have a beer, and eat some food.  Oh yeah, the owner is not the most friendly in the world (at least the one time I met him)

Now onto the burgers!  You cannot find a better burger in Madison at all.  Not even close!   They are made on a flat-top right in front of you and the taste is just wonderful.  If I did not have to watch my weight I would eat there all the time.   Check it out and do not forget to add the bacon to the burger!"}
{"text":"Wisconsin Pub Institution.  
I can't wait to see this place in a couple more decades or two.  I hope it never changes.  Yes, its a house, its a pub, its got beer and burgers.  
There's ambiance, as in old wood floors, beers on tap, old regulars who have had the same drink in twenty years and this is what it smells of.  
Come for the burgers, onion rings, fries or rubin specials.  This is what they are good at.  Sit at the cozy table or belly up to the bar that has been worn down from decades of beer bellies.  You'll never know who you are sitting next to.
Lunch or dinner is just as good."}
{"text":"Definitely the best burgers in the city of Madison! Don't pass up this gem, been coming here since the fifties, nicely remodeled bar area. YOU HAVE GOT TO GO TO TONY FRANKS!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new, and we've noticed this place during trips to the Arboretum. Was really disappointed.

Four of us ordered beers and burgers. There were 2 menus sitting on our table, which made ordering confusing. Which menu should we use, this old looking one with more options, or this newer one?! Waitress came back and said that the beer I wanted wasn't available. Okay, I'll try this one on the menu. Nope, don't have that one either. Okay, wow. After ordering our burgers, the waitress comes back and informs us of several other things they have run out of. No Swiss Cheese and no Pepperjack. Okay, well the Pepperjack Burger I just ordered is now just a cheeseburger. Awesome. One of us ordered double bacon on a burger and got two tiny pieces. Where's my double bacon? Oh, we ran out of bacon. Ugh. Also, where was the side of coleslaw that was supposed to come with my basket? Nevermind, I'll assume you ran out of coleslaw too. 

Also, the burgers are kind of expensive for this hole-in-the-wall place. Add $3 for a basket?! Paying $13-14 for a mediocre burger basket is not a good value in Madison, WI. Outrageous.

And the burgers were just okay. I hated the bun that my burger was served on. Tasted like corny syrup. The burgers aren't terribly big or meaty. While the burger was cooked well, overall just meh. I wouldn't drive across town to eat this particular burger. The onion rings we ordered were fine, perhaps a little overcooked. And for a full order of onion rings, it was a pretty small amount. Not a good value.

The place was pretty busy on Sunday. Lots of Badgers fans. Tony Frank's is quite a bit more of a dive bar than I expected. Our food took forever to arrive.

Despite being ignored initially by our waitress, she ended up being pretty good. 

If you live a couple blocks away, I'd say give it a shot. But otherwise, no, not that great."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent diner here year round.  Up until today enjoying the patio was always a pleasant experience.  Having the owners (or managers) 2 dogs running around among patio tables, begging for scraps or begging to get into the restaurant, was really irritating.  They may be cute dogs but their being among patrons was not.  Couple that with staff cleaning patio walls, floor, and signs right next to our table while we were eating was inexcusable.  Add to that the lawn mowing and leaf blowing during lunch, which could have been called off by management, dining, such as it was, was a bad experience trifecta.  Food was just o.k. and portion size considerably reduced.  In no hurry to return despite years of patronizing this place!"}
{"text":"I routinely came to Tony Frank's as a kid with my parents, and was excited to take my boyfriend here as an adult, especially since I hadn't been back since the smoking ban had been passed. It did not disappoint, though some things could have been done better.

The decor was cleaned up from when I was a kid, which had a very institutional feel to it. The walls are painted nicely, there are beautiful hardwood floors, and black and white photos adorn the walls. There were three TVs visible from our table, and the staff was very amenable to customer requests for which games to play (though the sound wasn't on, which was for the best). There is a tiny unmarked step from the foyer into the main dining room, so watch out for it - a less-attentive customer could go sprawling. The lack of thick cigarette smoke made the experience much improved. The tables and chairs are fairly comfortable. There is, sadly, nothing to absorb the noise that other customers make, which makes the place *extremely* noisy when even semi-busy; my boyfriend and I nearly had to shout our conversation in order to hear each other. On the other hand, the regulars have great conversations - more reminiscent of the atmosphere in a Northwoods bar than one of the yuppie downtown places, which is a welcome change from people trying to out-snob each other.

Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. As soon as we sat ourselves, she came over to take our drink orders, and was able to recite an impressively long list of the tap beers available when I asked. We both ordered beers to start; I ordered a Lake House from Capital Brewery because this was the first place I've found to have it on tap. It had notes of caramel, but there was a funky underlying taste of which I wasn't a huge fan, though I don't think that's Tony Frank's fault.

We both ordered cheeseburgers and fries; the menu doesn't state this, but you can order the burgers as a basket (with fries) for an extra $2.50. However, if you're going in a larger group, it's probably less expensive to just order the fries separately and share. The cheeseburgers were as good as I remembered them being from my childhood; they must use some sort of spice blend that sets them apart. The buns were standard whole wheat with sesame seeds. You can order lettuce and tomato for your burger, but you'll likely have to ask for it, as it isn't noted on the menu. The tomatoes were surprisingly not mealy or flavorless, and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. The fries were your standard Ore-Ida fresh from the freezer-bag fare; they were pretty underwhelming to me, but my boyfriend likes his fries as Ann as the nose on Plain's face, so he was quite happy. My boyfriend had ordered a water with the burger, and while the server initially forgot, she did remember it without a reminder, and was very nice after he accidentally knocked it over and spilled it everywhere. She also noticed me discovering the ketchup bottle was nearly empty and promptly brought over a full bottle before I even needed to make a request. She also brought the check over very quickly. I'd definitely return, though I'd probably come for an afternoon Packer game where I don't really WANT to talk, just have fun with my fellow fans. I'd also ditch the fries."}
{"text":"Great local pub. Good food. go for lunch, get the Rubin."}
{"text":"I went here because I was told they served the best mushroom cheeseburger in the area.  So that is what I ordered.  It was good but not spectacular.   Atmosphere was nothing that special but it was clean."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun.  Typical Wisconsin bar with added feature of ample tables for chow.  All food is prepared behind the bar and it's fun to watch the activity.  Give it a try for your next pub food outing."}
{"text":"Classic roadhouse tavern that's been around since 1929.  Bartenders are friendly, the food solid (one of the more underrated bar burgers in Madison), and if I imbibe too much, close enough to walk home (or take shelter in the Arboretum if I am feeling like a character from a Jack London novel)."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of the food, but the service on our last visit was atrocious and I decided that TF's is just too expensive and I'm not going again.  $8 to $10 for most sandwiches and they don't even come with fries.  That pricing is out of line with TF's ambiance."}
{"text":"We went to Tony Frank's today for dinner after a round of golf with the dads for Father's Day. It was a pretty awful experience; we've been to Tony Frank's before, but not in a while, and things have definitely gone downhill. We asked for waters three times, and never got anything. Twice we had to remind our waitress of an appetizer order. She was rude when asked a question about the menu, and she dropped dishes when clearing our table, and didn't bother to clean up the broken shards. The food is overpriced - at least $8 for a burger, not including fries or any side. It's nothing special and you can do a lot better in the immediate area in terms of price, food, ambience, and above all, service. We are not going back."}
{"text":"Nice, local bar. Good prices. Met the current owner, nice guy. Had a bunch of shots & beer. Can't beat an $8 pitcher of Hamm's!"}
{"text":"This was my neighborhood bar for a while. Nothing beats a group of friends and some pitchers of capital Amber with some football on. Always good service and good burgers; nothing fancy, nothing trendy, just a good working man's neighborhood bar, clean and with some character."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife, after a long hard day of hot work outside....needing a cool beer and some grub.  It was early afternoon, quite a few folks there, we sat at the bar.

Very pleased to see they offer Hopalicious on tap, decent selection of bottles.  We both ordered the Reuben, and were very pleased.  They used fresh shaved brisket for the meat, very generous helpings, and cook it right there, behind the bar.  Fries were typical pub fare but bonus - yummy brown horse radish mustard!

All in all, a very pleasant place for an afternoon bite and beer."}
{"text":"WARNING: Tony Frank's no longer has peanuts in the shell :(

I love a place with free peanuts in the shell.  My favorite is when I can throw the shells on the floor, but I am happy to put them in a separate basket if that's what the establishment prefers.  Peanuts in the shell is pretty much the reason I went to Tony Frank's (and the location works good for me).

However, upon arriving last night, I found out that they recently discontinued offering free peanuts in the shell.  I was given a small bowl of dry roasted peanuts, but what fun is that.  

Further, our kind bar tender who was on her second shift has, I believe, not received enough training.   I had to point out 20 minutes after ordering my burger and fries that nothing was being cooked.  Apparently a printer error...  It also took 4 requests to get the Badger basketball game put on...

I do not plan on returning to Tony Franks until they bring back peanuts in the shell.  Someone please message me when they do."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Black and blue burger is the bomb... Strong drinks. Fun atmosphere. Gets busy during lunch but worth the wait."}
