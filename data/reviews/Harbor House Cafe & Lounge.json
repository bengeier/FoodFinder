{"text":"Will never ever go back. 3 of the 4 of us got sick while we were eating there. My husband ended up going to ungent care and Doctor say it was food poisoning. EVERYTHING THERE WAS DIRTY.Worst meal all of us had ever had."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Camp Ground near by and thought the Harbor House was going to be a  dive/tourist trap. Was a pleasant surprise and a fun place to be."}
{"text":"We stopped in here the other day unexpectedly on our way to the dam and we were pleasantly surprised! The restaurant was a fun on the water atmosphere with very friendly staff. We sat on the patio and enjoyed our lunch that came in a very timely manner. We had the fish tacos and the Titanic burger, both were excellent. Great options for the kids as well, even though they were more interested in feeding the \"harbor mascot\" Rockstar, a crazy looking duck. We found this place on accident but will now be making it one of our stops whenever we come to town! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Left Hoover Dam and we wanted to spend some time at Lake Mead. We heard there was a cafe, but we were just expecting a snack bar. We were pleasantly surprised that it was a restaurant. Excellent service and delicious food. We had the Island Chicken sandwich and fish tacos. Both were awesome and the price was right!"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible service...no drinks, no food and no way to get wait staff to give you a glass of water....waited more than 45 minutes! Not a tourist friendly place!"}
{"text":"GOT SICK!! a few hours later after eating here. The only thing that we can pinpoint that got my son & I ill was the water we ordered because we all ordered different foods from the menu plus the drinks. It was horrible, it started with a stomach ache,fever,vomiting & then diarrhea. We had to take my son to urgent care and was given a nausea pill & recommended lots of fluids. 
Unfortunately we cut our vacation short & came back to Ca. My son I went to our doctors and explained our symptoms and where we had eaten. They couldn't confirm that it was the water but did say something might of not been properly sanitized .
The food there was not that great and after getting sick here I dont recommended to no one.

{"text":"I really enjoyed sitting lakeside at this cafe this passed weekend. I was very relaxing. I would definitely go back. I also liked the fact that I was able to sit in the patio with my DOGS drink some beverages and enjoy some food."}
{"text":"Great place to get lunch and a beer. Nice sit down and watch the waterfowl. The cost isn't bad and it's a fun walk on the pier to there. Bring some food for the birds and the coi fish.

There is also lots of activity in and around the pier. This is only a few mins away from boulder beach."}
{"text":"Service was super slow!  Our appetizers came out hot to where I burned the inside of my mouth.  I got the chicken teriyaki and the bun was hard as a rock.  Really let down here.  Seems like some organization will go a long way here.  We shall see."}
{"text":"Me and my 3 year old son bought food at the gift shop then took it over to the tables right next door at the harbor house cafe so we could eat at a table in the shade. There was no crowd so we were not taking tables away from paying customers and while we brought a small snack of our own the rest of our food was all purchased at the marina. A waitress came out and told us we couldn't eat there because we didn't but food from their restaurant....even though here was NO ONE there and I showed her the crappy prepackaged food we bought just next door. It's over a 100 degrees here this time of year, the only other benches available outside of that eating area were in the sun, so we sat on the dirty ground under the cover of the marina. While sitting there a male employee of the harbor house cafe was on the phone cursing repeatedly to someone on the phone loud enough for my son to hear. No class, no common sense or decency. We just bought a pass today and out of principle we will be sure to not spend a dime at this marina ever again. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"You want to dine on the water in the middle of the desert? You want a hole in the wall type of joint that hand frys their French fries? Go here. We went here on a whim after the Hoover Dam, and I'm so glad we did. You guys, the fries. The fries!!! The Hawaiian chicken burger was good, messy good. I'll definitely make a trip back. Great service too."}
{"text":"Horrible. It's like one of those places in the boondocks you get murdered at. Then they make food out of their poor victims. 

The coffee is practically water. 
The mug the coffee comes in has dried soap all over it and would stick to the dirty table.
Worse than cafeteria food. 
The eggs were not even eatable! 
The staff lack hygiene and manners. 

Worse breakfast of my life. It was like torture. Steer clear people!"}
{"text":"Worse place ever! My fiancé and I were looking for a place where we could have some lunch and thought we'd eat here! My fiancé got food poisoning and was severely ill. I do not recommend this place to anyone! Parents, when taking your kids here, please consider their health. Do not take your kids here!"}
{"text":"I will never return to this place . I wanted to make an order to go. So I was waiting in line for 10 minutes, there wasn't even anyone in front of me. By the time the server  comes (named Megan) took my order she just had a nasty ass attitude, did not say hi or anything. So when she asked for my card their machine was unable to read my card and it would not go through, then she walks away for about another 10 minutes without saying anything. Finally when she comes s back she snatched the card out of my hand and try's the card again and asks me if I was able to get another card?! As if it was my fault ? She was just so rude her energy was very shitty. I understand people have bad days but her attitude was just over the top. I came with some family and even they agreed that their customer service was just as bad and service was extremely slow!"}
{"text":"Hanging out at Harbor House Cafe reminds me of the Otis Redding song \"Sitting on the Dock of the Bay.\" Lake Mead isn't exactly a bay, but it is the closest thing to it in the Mojave Desert.

  Harbor House Cafe is part of the Las Vegas Boat Harbor marina. It is a cafe with indoor and outdoor seating surrounded by the Lake Mead water and boats. 

 Harbor House Cafe serves the typical cafe food during breakfast,  lunch, and dinner. It is a full-service restaurant with friendly waitresses.

 Harbor House Cafe is more than a restaurant. It is also a bar. They serve beer in cans (domestic $3), bottles (domestic $3 and imports $4), buckets (5 alike cans $12), and draft Michelob Ultra ($4) and Shock Top ($5.50). It is a bar that is over and above just serving beer. They serve cocktails that include Bahama Mama, Beach Bull, Naked Pirate, Sand in your Shorts, Tropical Sunrise, and Blue Coconut Margaritas. Plus they also serve wine.

  Today when I hiked round-trip between the Hacienda (might be Hoover Dam Lodge by the time you read this) and Las Vegas Boat Harbor, Harbor House Cafe was my half-way stop. It is a very tranquil spot to take a break on Lake Mead with a cold one. I ordered a Michelob Ultra draft in a plastic cup that I took to the patio where I felt like I was sitting on the dock of the bay. I enjoyed feeling the gentle breeze of Lake Mead, hearing the seagulls, and taking in the boats. I felt like I was transplanted back to Long Island. 

  The docks surrounding and including the Harbor House Cafe is a prime waterfowl viewing spot. Waterfowl from ducks to geese to what looked like a rooster are the free entertainment here. There was no shortage of an entertaining waterfowl coming into view. Just like any good entertainer, waterfowl brightens my mood.

  I timed it so I left Harbor House Cafe at sundown. Being a hiker into picture-taking, the sun coming down over Lake Mead was a nice way to end my break.

  There is relatively few places in the Mojave Desert where I feel like I am sitting on the dock of the bay. Harbor House Cafe gives this experience with friendly service. And I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Thanks Denise! You made our experience so fun. And you were right... the artichoke dip was fabulous. Great setting. Wonderful service!"}
{"text":"We popped in here due to poor planning.  We left our hotel on Lake Las Vegas going to Hoover Dam right around lunch thinking we'd get something to eat on the way.  What I failed to realize was that there would be no options for us at all until we reached this marina.  Thankfully, the food was great, service was wonderful and there were plenty of things to do to keep the kiddies occupied.  After parking, we walked onto the dock and first thing that struck us was the massive number of fish just swimming alongside the dock and swarming whenever we went close by to take a look.  Found out that people feed the fish and there will be massive swarms as they all angle to be fed.  Similarly, ducks abound to steal said food.

While they do sell hamburger buns to feed the fish, I'm sure that bringing your own bread will ultimately be cheaper.

They have a pretty extensive menu with stuff for the little ones and even a lighter fair option available.  Sandwiches were good, and the fries were awesome.  All the waitresses had pleasant attitudes and were very friendly.  They had some locals that they'd greet by name.

All-in-all, much better than we had expected!"}
{"text":"After a fun day of exploring, swimming & tanning at Lake Mead, we made our way over to the pier in hopes of finding some food. Thankfully, Harbor House is there!! It's by no means a fancy place, but we didn't expect that. It reminded me of the bars & restaurants that lined the shores back in Florida: beach/water themed decor, a pirate statue, water sport memorabilia, etc. 

We were seated instantly and taken care of by a nice lady who took the time to answer our tispy questions. Both my friend and I ordered burgers (she got the mini version of the \"Titanic\" burger and I got one that had bacon, cheddar and BBQ sauce on it). Both burgers came with fries (though you could pick something else as a side instead). The food was good and reasonably priced. They do have a bar with beer, wine and liquor. We didn't do any drinking there, but the prices looked pretty good for booze too.

Our server was very nice though a little slow in terms of coming back to our table and then getting our check. She was just the right amount of chatty (not overly chatty but also not like speaking to a brick wall). 

At the time we went (a Monday at like 5:30/6pm), the place was pretty quiet. A couple tables taken, but not busy by any means. I'll stop by next time I'm over on Lake Mead and need a good bite!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and staff. The bartender there yesterday afternoon (6/30/18) was super friendly and she was great! The food was 10+ in terms of taste and quality. Best little bar and restaurant on the Lake!"}
