{"text":"My colleagues decided to eat at The Atlanta Bread Company last week.  I wasn't too excited about returning after a disappointing visit a few years ago... one of those \"been there, done that/no need to go back there\" visits.  I've got to say, I was pleasantly surprised!  I ordered a soup & salad combo.  The sandwich was a Chicken Waldorf-- a tasty filling served on an even yummier focaccia.  The \"new\" chicken and wild rice soup had good flavor and consistency.  Everyone in my group left very satisfied with their meal.  I'm glad they forced me to give Atlanta Bread Company another try."}
{"text":"One of my fave places to eat! Good service. Good Food. The half and half deal is great! You can even only get one half of sandwich without having to get another side if you aren't that hungry. They have started rewarding their customers who are fans of them on face-book. In October if you check in on fb and show the cashier, you get a free med drink when you by an entree'. Oh and they have also come out with some amazing yummy muffins...my fave is the caramel apple crunch muffin... but there are also wild blueberry and french toast muffins... also yummy!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food.  Very friendly and nice staff but we went on a Sunday and I don't think anything was fresh. They had almost no bagels, the sandwich bread was hard, the corn salad didn't seem fresh and the breakfast sandwich was greasy and gross. They comped me the breakfast sandwich ( since they puzzlingly forgot the egg), but the waffle I got was not as good as the one I made myself at the Hampton inn free breakfast bar a few days ago."}
{"text":"I ordered a panini and a soup, and both tasted really good.  I will definitely be back for the food.  But I have to mention the uncomfortable atmosphere while there. I'm not sure if it's an everyday thing or if the staff was having a bad day when I visited. Employees did not want to be there and the manager wasn't the nicest to them,  either. So in all the service could be better but the food is amazing which is all that really mattered in the end."}
{"text":"The food here is lousy for such an establishment. For just a little over 20 dollars we received an Avocado sandwich, Turkey Bacon Rustica sandwich, and a strawberry smoothie.   Well.... The avocado was quartered and put on the sandwich which made the greenish brown bits slippery thus, fall out frequently onto your plate instead of in your mouth. To top this the avocado had the stem attached. What could make this any better? Perhaps the bread wasn't quite leavened to the point of a bakery shop's presumed reason to exist. I'm not sure why we actually ate this (We were quite hungry). The Turkey Rustica wasn't that much better. For having the word bacon in it, I do not remember actually being able to taste any sort of bacon within its contents. The bread also seemed to be a bit stale, but it was at least cooked correctly.   To be fair some of the more finer points is that this place made a good tasting smoothie (although, one can argue how hard that is). Being from the west coast, perhaps I am just a snood to what a good upscale bakery/sandwich/cafe shop should be. This is not that kind of example."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular patron here. The staff always treated me well, and the food, although overpriced, was decent and I usually opted to study with coffee.  However, this morning I bought some breakfast and coffee there, studied, and decided to rest my head for a couple of minutes. Then I felt a banging on my table and looked up to see the store owner very rudely tell me that I couldn't sleep. Honestly, I can see where he was coming from but wish it could have been conveyed in a more respectful manner. As a patron, I expect to be treated with good customer service, especially by the store owner. When I brought this up with the store manager, I received what I can only describe as the most insincere apology she could muster.   I am never returning to ABC. I also discourage anyone from supporting this establishment."}
{"text":"Not bad.  The decor sort of has an industrial feel, unlike Panera's warmer environment.  I think the bread, esp, sourdough, is better at Atlanta.  I did have breakfast here, and thought that pretty good.  Many more choices than Panera.  Sandwich-wise I prefer Panera.  However, Atlanta is a little closer to the main drags, and the local Paneras (esp. the Old Farm one) have such throngs of retirees, locals, students, meetings, etc. that it can be a zoo at certain times."}
{"text":"Not bad at all .. Curious why it's Atlanta bread and not Urbana bread ... Maybe they only had those letters .. So basically the dollar general version of Panera but solid prices and very comparable menu.  Also all day breakfast which is neat"}
{"text":"Atlanta Bread Co is NOT comparable to Panera.  To begin with, the bagels here are not as good, nor is there the same variety.  The pastries also leave much to be desired.  I love the Bear Claws at Panera but the ones at Atlanta are dry and have minimal filling.  Sandwiches and salads are somewhat comparable each offering something the other doesn't.  What I like about Atlanta is the breakfast menu.  There are several omelets and all are decent, though not exceptional.  The accompanying potatoes are so-so and usually cold.  Toast is always soggy.  The breakfast sandwiches are decent.  I have breakfast there every day during the week as it is near my workplace.  I have something different each day and the price is reasonable and the food is tolerable.  Under $5 for a three eggs omelet, potatoes, and toast isn't too bad.  I've tried all the omelets and two of the breakfast sandwiches and while they won't win any culinary rewards, they are filling and somewhat tasty.  Somewhat.  Do I recommend this place?  Well, like many such places, it's hit and miss.  Don't go with high expectations and you will be okay.  It's not gourmet food or haute cuisine but you'll probably find something you like and will enjoy."}
{"text":"Why didn't I read my own review before going here???  Again, mediocre is all I can say.  I didn't know what to order and the gal at the counter was very helpful.  Everyone I talked to were very helpful and nice and that is why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1.  I knew I wanted french onion soup and it was good.  But I didn't know what sandwich to pick so I asked which ones were ordered more often.  I chose the grilled chicken pesto pannini and it wasn't very good.  I can't imagine anyone ordering this pannini for a second time.  The chicken tasted old and the pesto had no flavor.  It even looked unappealing too.  Needless to say it will probably be another 2 years before I go back or if someone makes me go I will - - - -  but not without a protest."}
{"text":"I went to Atlanta Bread Company last week with a few co-workers to finally try it out (they had all recommended it), and I was just plain disappointed. When I first ordered, the girl at the counter couldn't understand what I was saying, even though I was speaking loud and clear. She seems distracted the whole time, so I'm pretty sure she just wasn't paying attention. The cashiers were rather chatty, which is totally fine, except they were ignoring waiting customers just so they could finish their conversation. Very unprofessional, not to mention annoying.  As for the food...meh. I ordered the veggie panini and was not impressed. The bread was soggy and all sorts of mashed, and the filling was pretty flavorless (haven't they heard of herbs?). It came with a pickle and chips, which you can't really mess up. All in all, I was not happy with this place, and I won't be eating there again.  Honestly, just go to Panera. The food is better and the service is usually on point."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a meal here that I didn't like, even if it is a chain restaurant and I'm a big fan of independent businesses.  Atlanta Bread Company is like Panera in featuring baked goods (breads, desserts), sandwiches (paninis included), salads, pastas, pizzas and soups. I usually go for the half and half meal that I get with a half sandwich and half salad. Note though that the half salad is still a big salad that can be a meal in itself so I usually save my sandwich for later.  Meals I've had, all of which lack complaints:  Chargrilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich Chopstix Chicken Salad Turkey bacon rustica"}
{"text":"Nope.   Wannabe Panera falls flat.   Ordered a sandwich, soup and soda. The sandwich bread was limp and damp, like it had been in a refrigerator with cling wrap resting on it damp with condensation. It had avocado, and while it was a generous portion it seemed like the avocado half had simply been tossed on the sandwich intact. Pieces falling out if you tried to take a bite. Scratch that...the entire sandwich was lazily and haphazardly tossed together.   Soup.  Mediocre, but acceptable. But the little chunk of baguette you get with the soup was essentially the cheap type of bread that is the same as the $1.99 loaf of warm French bread you get at the grocery store freshly baked. Difference being that the grocery store stuff is pretty good and warm.   Fountain drink. They were quite happy to sell me a fountain drink whilst their soda machine (one of those electronic pick your soda types) was out of -all- diet sodas and a few regular sodas as well. Their reaction? Oh, yeah... Guess we're out.   Overall I felt that they used cheaper ingredients and charged a comparable price for those cheaper ingredients than I would have paid at the place they try so hard to look like.   So, to recap - soggy, damp bread on which a poorly made sandwich was constructed. Cheap baguette. Mediocre soup. Got Sold a fountain drink to a fountain that was out of most soda and got an indifferent reaction from staff. Paid a comparable price yet got cheaper product.   Skip it. Go find a real Panera or eat someplace else. The indifference here shines through."}
{"text":"Caters hard to office workers so the service is crazy fast for the most part and incredibly friendly. Food is decent (Bella chicken is pretty good, buffalo chicken  panini is terrible), soda machine is a little broken, and it is a bit high in price."}
{"text":"I ordered their Chicken Waldorf sandwich on wheat bread and a half salad. The chicken waldorf was excellent; big chunks of chicken with cranberries and nuts - yum! The wheat bread was huge - think texas toast size - which made it very difficult to eat two slices as a sandwich. I eventually threw the bread aside and just ate the chicken salad out of it with a fork.  The half salad was bad. No, really bad. The lettuce was not fresh and I had a lot of pieces of lettuce that had the hard white vein running through the middle of the leaf. Ick. They don't have french dressing so I went with the honey mustard which was another bad choice. I took two bites and threw it away - there went $3!  For the amount of money I spent (total was almost $10!) and for the amount of food and the quality I received - the next time I'm going elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place often has a line at lunch (I haven't tried it much), but I find it unremarkable for breakfast.  Refillable coffee mug is nice, but the egg dishes just don't have much taste (is there butter for those eggs somewhere?).  Some of the pastries are better.    They sent out burnt french toast to me the other day (and not lightly: pretty black and charred). Manager did take one look when I walked it back to the counter and instantly ordered another one for me: so that was fast and helpful.  But, how how did it come out in the first place? staff cooked and hand delievered it: maybe without lookin at it? A brief apology would have made things nicer (a quick \"I'm sorry\" from that manager would have done, but not even that).  Two different visits the coffee was mislabeled or served in the wrong container (e.g. flavored coffee in the \"dark roast\" bin). Letting them know was a shrug and an \"okay, I'll look at it when I finish sorting these boxes\")  Staff is friendly but often are giggling at inside jokes or talking with each other while taking your order.  Summary: not horrible, but low attention to detail and customer service and mediocre food means Panera is probably a better choice."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and had a very good turkey and brie sandwich."}
{"text":"So in the last 2 weeks we have been her twice. The first time my wife ordered a grilled chicken panini. What do you expect... Maybe hot chicken and grilled bread. Well ICE COLD chicken, cheese not melted and no grilled bread. Sent it back and all they did was heat up her chicken. So we gave them a second chance today. My wife got the signature sandwich ABC special. It was made wrong. I ordered Saigon chicken. As they are bagging our food they say oh by the way we are out of sign on chicken so we made you Saigon turkey. Never asked if that was okay or anything.  I was fed up with this place and the new cooks they have that do what they want I got my money back and will head to Panera!"}
{"text":"Once just a Panera ripoff, Atlanta Bread has since added many more of its own creations. I tried the Italian vegetable panini the other night: tasty but expensive, given the portion size. Even after finishing the pickle and kettle chips that came with it, I felt barely satiated.  Decor is nice, as is the free wifi, but service is somewhat lacking. Nonetheless, this place feels like an adequate option if you're in the mood for a sandwich. (The pastas, however, are quite bland.)"}
{"text":"Chicken salad is great!!"}
{"text":"Love the food at Atlanta Bread Company, especially the Buffalo Chicken Salad and the Chicken Chili.  90% of the time I get carry out and it's pretty quick.  Only bad thing is that they have gotten my order wrong quite a bit.  I will still come here though because it's quick and easy.  I've never had a bad experience with the girls at the register, they are always extremely nice and have great energy.  Wish their kitchen was better at reading though :)"}
{"text":"Having had enough of Panera and pot belly sandwiches, I decided to give this a try and I am glad I did. Their offerings were nice, the food was fresh and reasonably priced. I would go here again in the near future."}
{"text":"Mediocre.  Place is expensive and I'd probably wouldn't eat here if I didn't have connects.  Chopstix Chicken Salad was alright except they forgot to ... add CHICKEN to it and also there isn't enough dark green leaves.  Bistro Chicken Press is bomb.com.  Raspberry-Mango-Strawberry Smoothie/Yogurt? it comes with granola and it's seriously the best yogurt I've ever eaten. It must be fattening :(  Margherita Pizza is tasty and simple.  Their pastries with cinnamon or whatever on top are realllllly really good.  Their Sweet Tea isn't very good. There's like no flavor.  There's no drive thru ;( and finding comfortable seating inside can be very bad by 12-1 (lunchtime).  If a comparison needs to be made, I prefer Panera."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, a bit expensive for the actual food I think but overall good. I'm very particular about what I put in my body so I often have extensive directions or requests for my orders and they always seem to work with them to fit my needs!"}
{"text":"I go to Atlanta Bread because it is in a convenient location between my home and school. Atlanta Bread is a poor man's Panera Bread as other reviewers have stated. I often go there if I want a quick breakfast. Their Spanish Omelette is pretty good, and the Florentine is a nice low-calorie option, but needs Tabasco. The Tomato Bacon would be pretty good if it wasn't so difficult to cut through the bacon. They put whole strips of bacon in the omelette, which I thought was pretty unusual. Their breakfast potatoes are among the best I have had, and they are even better with hot sauce.   I order the Fettuccine Salmon when I go there for lunch or dinner. I have also had the Chicken Parmesan. The pasta dishes come with a small piece of white bread. These dishes are about what you would expect from a cheaper restaurant.  They have a loyalty program using your phone number that gives you $7 back for every $100 you spend."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Friday.  Okay so I wasn't sure what Atlanta Bread was. I assumed it was either a spin off or a knock off of Panera Bread. While I was waiting on line I Wikipediaed them turns out it's a knock off. Basically in 1993 the creator of AB visited a PB and figured that if he stole basically everything down to the warm earthy decor of PB he would have a successful place. At its peak there was 250 franchised locations across the US in 2014 there are about 50 still standing. So I'm assuming that this Atlanta bread here in champaign has been a successful franchise because it's one of the few survivors.   I had a cheddar broccoli soup and a Caesar salad. Soup was solid, salad was decent. The portion sizes on both were generous.   I liked that after you order they bring the food out to you. I didn't like that they blatantly ripped off Panera bread. I did notice they have pizza on the menu so I guess that's their highlighted difference between Panera bread. So yeah if you like soup salad bread or Panera you will probably like this place."}
{"text":"Foods pretty good (although portions are small), coffee's good and you get pretty much unlimited refills if you drink it there, but tea selection is terrible (and poor quality).  A pretty good place for lunch and studying, though.  It's never gotten too loud during lunchtime or right after lunch, but sometimes they shut off the free wifi from 11:30am-1:30pm to deter people with laptops from hanging around during that time.    Large booths and tables tend to be a pretty good size, big enough for a couple people to study at.   Unfortunately, they close pretty early during the week and on the weekends, forcing people to pack up and go somewhere else.  Overall, not bad for food and studying, but not great for those who are looking for somewhere to study at night."}

{"text":"There's apparently a disconnect between the on-site management and the owner. My daughter and I were in a hurry and we stopped in at 10:00 AM on  Thursday, January 15, 2015. We ordered  two bagels, toasted, with cream cheese. We learned that the service that is connected with this involves tossing a portion control packet of cream cheese into a paper bag and throwing in a plastic knife. We asked for them to toast the bagels and spread the cheese on them.  For this we got snarls. There were five employees standing around chatting among themselves but the person wearing the manager badge was doing food preparation on the customer service of some large bowl of chopped bread. When she coughed right over the bowl of chopped bread it was not a good sign. 11 minutes later there was no sign of our bagels. Nor was there any sign of activity from the five idle workers. So I inquired. One of them told me that the \"cheap bastard\" that owns the place has refused to fix the toaster on the front service line so our food has to be prepared back in the kitchen the manager then said they're working on it. 15 minutes after we walked in the door on a business day with no customers ahead of us we left with two toasted bagels and the manager promised me it wouldn't be this bad the next time we came. I promised her there wouldn't be a next time."}
{"text":"I actually like this place. Food is good, just as good as Panera in my opinion. Lots of places for studying. I recommend giving it a shot"}
{"text":"I'm not impressed with this place at all.  I do compare it to Panera because they serve identical things with similar decor.  If they wanted to not be compared, they should have done something about their menu or decor.  I think their sandwiches (and warm sandwiches) are smaller.  I don't like their bread either.  As are their soups.  I tried the chicken chili and it was good but too small... but it's not better than the Panera Chicken and Wild Rice Soup.   I think this place is only better because it's cleaner.  They have a person that cleans off the tables (unlike Panera) and it's closer to campus for students."}
{"text":"Someone asked me if Atlanta Bread Company and Panera Bread are the same.  I guess the comparison can't be helped as they're both soup and sandwich chains, but my answer: absolutely not.  I harbor a special love for Panera in my heart that Atlanta will never compete with, no matter how many tries I give it.  My visit today pretty much confirmed that.  A fist-sized portion of bread is served with most meals.  In the past, I've always been turned off by their bread, which is usually pale and under-baked.  I don't have much faith in a place that claims to be a \"bread company,\" but serves such sorry bread.  On my most recent visit, the baguette wasn't disturbingly discolored and it had a nice crunch to the crust.  I also noticed a subtle hint of olive oil in the bread's recipe.  Maybe they're making a few improvements.  Like most lunch chains, I'm sure the soup comes packaged and is heated in-store.  I ordered the chicken and wild rice soup today.  Highlights: the soup had conspicuous specks of pepper and bright green chives.  Unfortunately, it also had the color and consistency of glue...  I suspect that the grain had broken down and congealed into a thick paste that was not appetizing.  Atlanta also separates itself from Panera by serving a few additional items on their menu, including pastas.  My vegan lunch buddy tells me that Atlanta is a little more generous to those with dietary restrictions, though I don't have any special recommendations to vegetarians/vegans out there."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, I end up wishing I hadn't.  In my opinion, the amount of food received for the price is very low.  I just went today to get some soup, and ended up with a 10oz. bowl of Chunky Baked Potato soup and what I would describe as a 'morsel' of bread for about $4.  The bread was about half of the baguette size at Panera (which seems to be the obvious comparison, and similarly overpriced), and I felt that the soup quality (approximately cream of potato) and portion size were low on both counts.  I have been here at least 3 times, that I can remember, and have had similar feelings each time. My previous visits were for sandwich/soup combos that were definitely not worth remembering.  The building and location are both nice, and convenient to my work, but I can't say for certain that I'll return soon."}
{"text":"I give this place a 5 star rating because the sandwiches were excellent. They tasted fresh and uniquely exquisite. I usually go to Panera, but Atlanta Bread does a definitely good job. Also, the prices are much reasonable compared to other places. For instance, their croissants look amazing and taste even better. Unlike those from Espresso Royal."}
{"text":"Not sure the connection with Panera but basically the same only missing something. Don't like the signs telling you to get out after you eat, or something to that effect."}
{"text":"My family and I have a running joke about this place being a rip off off Panera (we call it Banera) but that doesn't mean we like it any less. I actually like their soups. My mother, during our ladies lunch, tried their tomato basil. It was really great, not too salty. The restaurant is always neat, clean, and the service is friendly and doesn't mind explaining every single thing on the menu to us poor souls. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best soup/salad/sandwhich/breads and assorted foods place in CU."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the cheese pastry, not anything else. I have been searching for tasty pastries in town, and to be frank, there aren't many choices available for a person hate things too sweet. So far, Panera's chocolate pastry has been my favorite.  (And BTW, I like Panera very much!) But now, I probably will also go for Atlanta's cheese pastry. Although I cannot say the same for the almond one. What's in that thing?!"}
{"text":"eh I'd rather get a cheap burger.  I got the mango salsa salmon salad and it was ok but I was still starving afterwards."}
{"text":"Restaurant review I think the other reviews have said it best, this is a poor knock off of Panera that does not meet the quality or the freshness that you would get elsewhere. My experience was rather poor. We came for dinner as this is the only time I can get here from work with my family. There was absolutely no line at all. The cashier who took our order appeared to not care at all. There was no friendliness or even a greeting to speak of. I ordered a panini andmy wife ordered a pasta with what I believe was a piece of chicken. For my son, he got a bowl of soup. Even though there was no one here, the food took an exceptionally long time. I don't know if the soup is made from scratch, but it looks and taste similar to soup you could get at Old Country Buffet or Hometown buffet when that was still here in Champaign. My panini did not fair much better. The bread selection reminded me of bread used with a torta. It had no evidence of any grill marks and just did not have the right texture. Finally the pasta taste and looks like something you could have prepared at home. Very light on the sauce as noted by the photos. Overall this is quite disappointing. If I am paying panera prices, I think I am better off going to Panera in the future  Pros: large menu selection of bread, pasta, and sandwiches/salads  Cons: poor customer service, slow food prep, the quality of the food item just is different than what you get at Panera.

{"text":"I'm a big fan! They definitely give you bigger portions than Panera and aren't badly priced. Their chicken enchilada soup and greek salad are my favorite things there. I've also had their pesto sandwich, but I'll agree with Sarah L. when she said their food is much more healthy and not quite as tasty as Paneras, which is far more fattening. I'd definitely reccomend checking it out regardless!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are very tasty, the soups (especially the Baja chicken enchilada soup) are great, the service and atmosphere are very friendly and the pastries taste great too."}
{"text":"We love Atlanta Bread. The food is fresh and the employees are always nice. We  go so often they know us by name and always ask how our family is doing. Definitely check them out."}
{"text":"It's hard to be in this place without comparing it to Panera, and I think it comes up short.  The dishes I had did consist of fresh ingredients, but I think they were more healthfully prepared which made them not quite that super sodium-y fatty Panera tasty.    It was really clean in there, but I kind of got the feeling that was only because it was brand new and that in 6 months it would be grimy.  The staff were really friendly, but it was a very forced friendliness.  The free wifi is cool.  If it were closer to campus, I would probably think it was a great place to have a working lunch or a sticky bun while doing more work after work."}
