{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a friend and we decided to give it a try. It is small, cozy and charming - so definitely call ahead as it can get crowded even on a weekday. The reason why this place is so popular is because the food is simply delicious. We had a three course meal and every dish was exquisite. A little pricey but worth every penny. Definitely one of the best meals we had in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Le P'tit Plateau is the quintessential hidden gem - the kind of place that one hopes to find serendipitously while walking through the neighbourhood.  This cozy restaurant oozes with French charm. The food is delicious, the service is thoughtful, friendly and genuine. You can have all the decadence of French food without the condescension."}
{"text":"Very cozy restaurant. Accommodated last minute reservations. BYOW (bring your own wine) as they don't carry their own. I had the lamb which I really enjoyed but my wife's venison was out of this world good. Perfectly cooked, and just \"gamey\" enough to make it distinct from a typical beef steak."}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for a week, eating in a different restaurant every night, and this was by far the best meal we had. The space is small, but very comfortable and pleasant to be in, the service is excellent, and the food was imaginative, well executed, and delicious. 

On the night we went, there was only one waiter to attend to 10 or so tables; he had no help seating, clearing, or bringing out food. But he was always there when we wanted him, and never bothered us when we didn't. He did appear to be out of breath a few times, but that wasn't his fault.

The menu is brief, but we still had to think hard when choosing, since everything on it was tempting. We were both satisfied with our choices. My duck was perfectly cooked, and expertly presented; the sides were delightful. My wife's lamb was the same for her (I had some, but preferred the duck; she had some of mine, and preferred hers. Perfect).

What we saved by bringing our own bottle of wine, we tipped the waiter. It was worth it. 

If you want an excellent meal in an understated but congenial atmosphere, I cannot recommend this place highly enough. If you want Disney food in a cramped, overstated room full of ersatz ambiance, stay away, and let the rest of us enjoy it."}
{"text":"I came here on a friend's recommendation. Know that they do have vegetarian/vegan options in addition to what's usually on the menu (yay). Service was great and the food was served hot, which I appreciated. We thought they were a little light on the salt/seasonings but would love to check this place out again in the winter."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here last weekend and it was by far and away one of the best meals that we have ever had.  We started with the foie gras and then had the salmon and cassoulet for dinner.  Each dish was excellent.  Our table had a view of the kitchen and we had a bird's eye view of the chef pan frying the duck for the cassoulet!  Truly tremendous!  The service was fantastic and the setting was very intimate.  The BYO wine policy helps to keep the cost reasonable.  We can't say enough about this restaurant, we would highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Il s'agit d'un des meilleurs restaurants dans lequel j'ai mangé. Le service est impeccable et le personnel est courtois. Le prix de la table d'hôte peut sembler dispendieux, mais vous aurez de la qualité dans votre assiette. Mon potage était fort goûteux, mon repas (une assiette de cerf, d'échalotes confites et de gratin dauphinois) était succulent et mon dessert (de la crème brulée maison) était divin! Du bonheur culinaire! :)"}
{"text":"This was my second time going to \"Le P'tit Plateau\" and the first was over 2 years ago. I always hesitated since my first experience was so great, I didn't want to taint that memory I had. I don't regret my decision, it was as great as I remembered!

I ordered a salmon tartar to start the night, followed by a leek (poireau) potage and a lamb shank (souris d'agneau) as a main course. Everything was absolutely delicious. The lamb was perfectly serve and all the meat came right off the bone. All this combined with the fact that you can BYOB/W makes for a great overall experience.

The restaurant itself has a very cozy atmosphere. It's very important that you reserve in advance, since it can only hold about 30 people. Despite the price range, you never feel like you're in a snooty/snobby place. The waiting staff is amazing and make you feel welcome at all time. 

5/5, Will come back! (In less than 2 years I hope)"}
{"text":"Incredible, lovingly prepared decadent French food in an intimate location. (This may be the best food you'll have ever, unless you're fortunate to live in Montreal all the time.) Floored by the pride was taken in the service. Go here for a special dinner."}
{"text":"This is for sure the best restaurant I've ever been to in Montreal. 

I've been twice, once with my boyfriends family and once for my birthday. It is on the pricey side (appetizers $9-$12, main courses $25-$34), but you really need to get the escargot appetizer.... unlike any I've had before, but sooo good. I think I had the venison filet both times, and it melts in your mouth. 

I also loved the atmosphere. It's super small and not really fancy, but has a nice intimate feel. The kitchen is open and the host/waiter makes you feel welcome with out being overbearing. 

Make it a point to eat here, you won't be disappointed, the food is incredible. Just make sure to make reservations. They have two seatings, I think one around 5:30 and one around 8:30..I'd try for the second, but just because I wouldn't want to feel rushed."}
{"text":"First, I will say that the food here was very decadent. I enjoyed the food very much, although I found it to be a little too rich. I had the lamb, with a cream of cauliflower soup to start, and shared the smoked salmon; maybe it was my choices that were on the rich side, but either way, the food was good.

I was somewhat disappointed in my dining experience because even though the decor is quite pleasant, one of the servers continually bumped into my chair, and even elbowed me in the head at one point. The tables are far too close together and the restaurant is too crowded for such a small space. I would not have minded so much if the waiter so much as acknowledged that he continually bumped me (never mind an apology?).

Despite the food being tasty, I will not go back to Le P'tit Plateau."}
{"text":"Came here with my bachelor party crew and really enjoyed it. Being that it was BYOB we were able to get some great French cuisine at a reasonable price with alcohol. It is a smaller place, seems perfect for a date night. Food was great, entrees came with a soup or salad, and prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Very cozy restaurant. The food was great as was the service. Give it a try. But you should probably reserve in advance."}
{"text":"Restaurant format bistro, à la cuisine raffinée. Des potages à déguster absolument. Parfaite cuisson des viandes, juste rosées, foie gras frais, légumes inventifs. Desserts délicat, le croquant praliné au chocolat ...
Prendre le menu et surtout appeler pour réserver. Très belle ambiance.
Une réussite à Montréal"}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Montreal.  Hands down. BYOB. The deer steak was so tender it was shocking and perfectly paired with house foie gras. Souris de agneau was also fantastic. Perfectly executed. Perfectly priced. Perfect location.  Perfect."}
{"text":"Not my first (and certainly not my last) BYOB experience, Montreal's Le P'tit Plateau offers a casual fine dining experience, scandalously decadent dishes, and no corkage fee. You really can't go wrong.

At a first glance, the menu looks ridiculously expensive. $36 for Lamb Confit? Preposterous! What you quickly realize, though, is that you're paying for quality, for excellent service, for the fact that the restaurant doesn't serve drinks, and for a starter soup or salad and a meal-finishing coffee. So, even with dessert, your entire 3 course meal comes to just under $50 per person. Even with your pre-bought bottle of wine (if you're like me, it'll be around $15), that's pretty good for this level of quality.

You're probably wondering just what that $50 will get you. Well, amongst the six of us, we tried three items from the dinner menu, all of which were outstanding examples of perfectly cooked French cuisine.

The medallion of venison was cooked to medium and served with a semi-sweet barbecue sauce, crispy fried shallots, foie gras (to die for), scalloped potatoes and puréed turnip. This was, in fact, my first taste of foie gras and (despite the ethical implications, animal rights, and images of force-feeding flitting through my mind), I loved it. I know I shouldn't, but there's a reason why people are fighting so hard for the right to continue producing fatty duck/goose liver.

The lamb confit literally slid off the bone, exuding a tenderness that only comes from hours and hours of slow cookery. It was served with spices, almonds, zucchini, and lima beans.

The duck confit was juicy and flavourful, with a side of arugula, dried magret, a lone runner bean, and gizzards (which my friends tentatively nibbled on - I wasn't so adventurous).

For dessert, our table abounded with crème brûlées, fruit sorbets, and chocolate mousse cakes. After three courses and 5 bottles of wine (we couldn't quite make it to our 6th within the two hour time frame), I'd say that we were all pretty much sated. Glutted, even. It was great.

Le P'tit Plateau is well worth a visit, whether you live in Montreal or plan on being a Québécois tourist at some point in the near future."}
{"text":"Every part of it was excellent! The food was fantastic (we even got dessert!), BYOW is convenient, and Andre our waiter is an absolute professional that made it all that much better!"}
{"text":"One word comes to mind - WOW. Food and service were spectacular. My fiancé and I have traveled all
over the world and seldom have had a meal as exemplary as this one. 
I ordered the venison and he ordered the lamb shank. Both were perfectly cooked. We got a duck appetizer which was perfectly seasoned. It's also BYO which we love since we're \"wine snobs\". If I ever return to Montreal I will most definitely return to this restaurant, regardless of location or decor."}
{"text":"Depuis un petit moment déjà j'avais enregistré Le P'tit Plateau dans mes \"favoris\" sur Yelp.

Nous y sommes allées trois copines pour le souper. Une d'elles connaissait et aimait déjà la place donc la décision d'y aller a quand même été facile.

Pour ma part j'ai pris le Confit de canard, roquette, gésiers et magret séché. Une copine a pris le Filet de saumon, crevettes, vin blanc et champignons et l'autre a pris le Cassoulet du P'tit Plateau aux cinq viandes. Selon la copine habituée le saumon est son plat favoris à ce restaurant, voilà pourquoi elle a fait ce choix, mais n'ayant pas l'occasion de manger du canard bien souvent, j'en ai profité.

Le plat en soit, super bien présenté (comme ceux de mes amis d'ailleurs) J'ai adoré la texture du canard confit et les gésiers était parfaits. J'ai particulièrement aimé le genre de proscuitto de canard. Miam. Par contre, je ne vous cacherai pas que le goût était particulièrement intense et même si c'etait vraiment délicieux, je me suis comme un peu tanné de le manger. J'ai donc opté pour ramener le reste de mon assiette à la maison. J'ai beaucoup apprécié le reste du confit le lendemain dans une salade!

Si je recommande le resto? Oui, absolument. En plus, c'est un apportez votre vin et le service est très sympa!"}
{"text":"Great location. Great food. Great service. All you could ask for in a restaurant. BYOW too which is a nice touch for the budget conscious customer."}
{"text":"Incredible food, incredible service, so cozy and cute, great vibes. Might be my favourite restaurant in Montreal - the price is worth it, and the fact that it's BYOB makes it even more so."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, j'y suis allée peut-être 4 fois déjà. J'ai également offert un certificat cadeau à ma mère pour qu'elle y aille avec mon père.
Tellement abordable pour de la si bonne cuisine et pour un restaurant apportez votre vin. Wow. 

Excellent restaurant, ive been there like 4 times already i think. I even gave my mom a gift certificate so she can go with my dad. So not expensive for such a good quality meal. Also it's a BYOW. Wow."}
{"text":"Tiny little restaurant with amazing food. Been there a few times and never been disappointed at my dishes.  BYOW"}
{"text":"Updated review as they seem to have changed owners and made some budget cuts. The service was still on par but the quality of the plates was noticeably diminished. My old favorite lamb shank encrusted with almonds only had a few specks of almonds on it. The cut of venison was not as tender as before. Maybe it was an off night? To be continued..."}
{"text":"This nice, small, quiet restaurant has amazing food and good service.  Definitely a place to bring out-of-towners to sample French gastronomy."}
{"text":"J'ai visité ce resto avec mes collègues de bureau, j'ai aprecier mais le agneau était meilleur que le cassoulet. Ambiance était tranquille, bcp de couple. Je donne une note de 6/10"}
{"text":"You may have to book in advance if you want to try this sweet little restaurant. The place is amazing, the service is friendly and the food is exquisite. Just the right amount of sauce, seasoning and that perfect combination of everything makes it almost a culinary adventure.

It's a BYOB restaurant and has a solid reputation with locals and tourists, their menu is small, but every dish is perfectly prepared and served with a smile, why would you need more? If there is a list of restaurants to visit here in Montreal, I would definitely put it on top 10 list."}
{"text":"Even though we had SO many great meals on this trip and this one's been totally overshadowed by others, I have to be fair and give it four stars as any other time in any other place, it would've been a pretty memorable meal. BYOB, of course we were running late so we went to the restaurant first, asked them about the closest liquor store (SAQ on the corner of Duluth & St. Denis) then RAN back to the restaurant. It's been a few weeks so my memory's hazy (and they don't seem to have a website to refresh my memory) but I believe we had foie gras torchon and escargot for appetizers then duck breast and lamb leg confit for entree. The escargot appetizer was quite memorable, unlike any other preparations I've had, with creamy sauce and fresh vegetables or herbs. Great mix of texture and flavor. Highlight of the meal. The foie gras torchon was also excellent. The entrees were also very good, but perhaps not as memorable as the appetizers as I can't seem to recall much about them other than the fact that they were delicious! I had floating islands as dessert (good, but I prefer my meringue crunchy on the outside) and my husband had something that I have no recollection of other than the fact that it tasted very strongly of alcohol to me -- but then I don't drink at all and can taste alcohol in the most miniscule amount. He loved it and proclaimed it a very \"adult\" dessert. Overall a great meal, not sure if it's a destination-dining sort of place, but most definitely a solid neighborhood spot. I know I would totally frequent it if I lived in Montreal! Also a very nice waiter, we even shared our wine -- which he happily drank!"}
{"text":"I had the greatest meal here.  The food is inventive and the service is warm and friendly.  They serve simple, elegant French food here and the presentation is very nice.  This restaurant doesn't serve alcohol but has a BYOB policy... sweet!  Definitely worth a trip.... Oh, and the desserts are terrific."}
{"text":"Our first time to this restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised! First of, can i just say that our waiter, Royd (i hope that i got it right) was one of the best waiter that i've encountered so far in my life! Polite, courteous, professional and all-around nice! Even if the food was bad, i would forget all about it just because he is simply the best! 

But...

The food was excellent! Everything that we ordered was executed perfectly! The menu is very small so choices are limited. No problem when it's done right. All main comes with choice of salad or soup, tea or coffee. Appetizers and desserts are \"à la carte\". My hubby and i shared a salmon tartar that was so fresh and delicate! Very good! The table next to us had the escargots. We're going for that next time :) i got the lamb shank. Ohhh! Melts-in-your-mouth-deliciousness! Hubby ordered the  the venison (deer) with red wine reduction and foie gras (en torchon). Cooked medium rare and the portion of foie gras was so, so, so generous! The only thing that he would of liked was for the foie gras to be more tempered and not \"out of the fridge to the plate\" king of thing. He tried to see if they could torch it a bit knowing very well that the foie gras would melt like butter but the waiter (not ours. An older man) \"kindly\" refused. Heck... The food was so good that we let that slip by :/  Both our main had the same sides: gratin dauphinois (superb!), celeriac purée with a piece of prune, baby green beans and summer squash.

The meal summed up to a bit under 120$ taxes and tips included for the both of us. Not bad at all for a byob restaurant and not bad at all for the quality of the food and especially for the service we got from out fabulous waiter! 

Will definitely come back. 

Make sure to make reservations!!!"}
{"text":"When you see nothing but five star reviews - you better believe this place is worth checking out.

Quiet, intimate, and a place where we were welcomed as if we were family. Our waiter was so friendly, charming, and attentive. Definitely memorable service as we were provided with excellent recommendations. This is a Bring Your Own Wine restaurant so make sure to take advantage of that while enjoying the phenomenal food. 

The food was reasonably priced and you get more than a meal for your money. Just the thought of the lamb shank is enough to get me to book a flight back. While the food is great and filling, save some room for dessert. The crème brulee and chocolate mousse were amazing!"}
