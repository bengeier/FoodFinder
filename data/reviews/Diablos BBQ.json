{"text":"Went there with the family for a quick supper on a beautiful Summer Night in the MTL
wanted to try this place to compare with the other BBQ-Texas style restos (Boucan and Icehouse)

vibe/atmosphere very Rockabilly tkx to the great waitresses (super friendly)
since it was nice we sat outside so did not get a good look at the resto, terrace is ok nothing special and smaller than expected

we started off with disappointing drinks (true what one of the reviewer said, pictures do not reflect the drinks) served in Masson jar (so original, never seen it B4...) and they were at room temperature!!! i asked for a glass of ice to refresh them, but those summer drinks should be icecold and i would of put some special salt/spices on the rim of the jar to kick things up. 

the menu is very diversified, plenty to choose from and maybe too much? 

we tried :

hush puppies were ok a bit flavory but nothing great
had a bite of my daughter's pulled pork taco and it was very tasty, specially with the nice coleslaw on top
GF took the pulled pork sandwich and it was H-U-G-E lots and lots of tasty meat (miam)
daughter took the shrimp popcorn; was ok but would not reorder
i had the BEST meal!! the fried chicken and rib combo
chicken has a nice breading, huge portion, very moist (would of liked it a bit spicier). if u wanna compare it to Icehouse, this one has lots of breading ala Shake N Bake (wich is pretty good), Icehouse has more skin and more tang

but the STAR of the night were those great ribs... Viva Las Smoker!! man o man still drooling ala Homer over them; great smoky-charcoal taste, meat falls of the bone, no glazing just good ol char (it's served with a nice bbq sauce, but still ate them plain)

u can choose from various sides, we had corn, jalapeno cornbread and fries (mix of regular and sweet potato) all 3 were very good specially the sweet potato fries

all in all good night at Diablo (would've given 3 1/2 stars but can't)

i should try it again with live music and no kid!!! and extra serving of RIBS"}
{"text":"J'ai vraiment apprécié cet endroit. C'est certain que je vais y retourner. Je donne 5 étoiles pas parce que c'est un 5 étoiles mais parce que leur concept est très, très bien exécuté et la bouffe était excellente.

Je dois dire que c'est plutôt particulier mais très intéressant si on est pas stuck up. Je décrirais la bouffe comme étant \"mâle\"."}
{"text":"Après avoir étudié de près la trentaine de burgers qui seraient à l'affiche pour Burger Week MTL, mon premier choix s'est arrêté sur Diablos Smokehouse, nouveau spot qui avait ouvert ses portes quelques mois auparavant. Diablos offrait ''Le Sixième Péché Capital'' (15$), composé d'un pâté de buf AAA, fromage provolone, bacon et ketchup fumés. Le TOUT était par la suite... frit (!). Y'en fallait pas plus pour convaincre mon Bro et moi.

Cette bête est accompagnée d'un à-côté de votre choix. Les pommes de terre pillées étaient vraiment bonnes, à l'inverse du mix de frites  régulières et de patate douce. Mais bon, on n'était pas là pour ça.

 Avant d'attaquer le burger, il a fallu le couper en deux pour une meilleure appréciation, tant gustative que visuelle. Dès la première bouchée, je savais déjà à qui allait mon vote. Chacune de ces bouchées se résumait en une explosion de gras et de saveur dans la bouche et on n'a même pas mal à l'estomac par la suite, comme avec le Foie gras ou Mac n cheese.

Avec le mix de fromage fondant, sauce, friture et pain, le tout goûtait comme un mélange de lasagne et pizza...dans un burger.

Bref, si vous n'êtes toujours pas convaincu avec les photos, je vous suggère d'aller faire un tour au Diablos pour l'essayer, il est toujours sur le menu !"}
{"text":"We went there last night and all three of us were very disappointed. It may be we just ordered the wrong items but not one was anything close to decent never mind anything to rave about.

Admittedly I have been spoiled with bbq having lived in Texas and been to hundreds of BBQ joints all over the southern US as well as the not to be missed on any account - Dr Hoggly Woggly's (not sure the spelling) near Van Nuys airport in Los Angeles.

However even ranked against Montreal BBQ this place left a lot to be desired.

I had the 'signature' beef rib. It was a dried out lump of tasteless beef like substance which in parts was so hard as to be inedible. Soaking it in bbq sauce made it palatable. The fries were over-salted but ok; the coleslaw was actually pretty good.

N had cajun shrimp. They were blackened for sure but basically tasted like lumps of salt. She ate half my fries to get some sort of sustenance.

J had the smoked salmon. Again it was dried out and hard enough to pave your driveway. The smash potatoes he had were very good.

Service was good. The waitress was attentive and pleasant.

In short, don't bother with this place unless they sack the chef. Even St Hubert does better bbq. I am not kidding."}
{"text":"A friend of mine reccommended we go here after a long day on the mountain.. everyone else was excited, myself not so much (I am a vegetarian). Once we got there, however, we were greated with such awesome service I was pretty pleased. Then I learned they had Rolling Rock on tap! Made it better. After checking the menu I saw they had Mac N Cheese.. It was amazing! (It comes with sausage on top so if youre a vegetarian that doesnt like meat touching your food, ask right away for there not to be any. I dont really care so I just plucked it off and gave it to my bf) The patatoe salad was incredible, THEY HAD CORNBREAD!!!!! Which I was pretty happy about, given I'm from the south. I was with a group of 10 people and every single person was so happy and content and stoked to go back there. I think they are going to do VERY well and will only get better. I am definitely reccommending this place to all my friends and will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"What's better than Rockabilly, ribs and booze?!?!

Went with my boyz for a night out on the town.  We randomly walked into Diablo's BBQ not knowing what to expect. We were waited on by a heavily tattooed, yet professional, waitress who brought us some original tasty funky drinks. Ordered the ribs...mmmmm...proceeded to order more of them funky drinks and the rest was a blur!"}
{"text":"*Diablos Smoke House*

You wanna cow my boy?

On est transporté dès qu'on traverse la porte. Le décor est digne du sud, ça sent le fumé, la bouffe goûte la smoke, la saveur est au rendez-vous. Vaste choix de cocktails Vs mini choix de bière en fût, ce qui m'a un peu grafigner l'esprit \"one man one steak one beer\" mais j'm'en suis remis. 

Nouveau resto et le service est comme s'il était vieux de 2 ans. Intérieur en bois de grange à vache, vieille chaise en bois coussinées assez confo, des crânes bovins, un tatou, affiches Sailor Jerry de l'époque, etc... 

La musique est parsemé d'Elvis smooth et d'oldies. J'avoue m'être surpris à me dandiner avec ma mailloche dans la bouche en fredonnant. Bonne place pour les petits groupes qui veulent aussi jaser en mangeant à mon avis.

Ce resto est cohérent et je conseil de l'essayer au moins une fois cet automne!"}
{"text":"Je suis allé avec ma femme dans ce resto suite aux avis favorables de Yelp et la déception!!! Plus d'1 heure d'attente pour manger un burger beaucoup trop cuit et des frites ultra salées! En allant aux WC vous pourrez vous faire une idée des cuisines qui sont juste dégueulasses!!!! Je ne la conseille absolument pas! Si vous pouvez faire 15 mètres de plus allez aux \"3 brasseurs\" rapport qualité prix très bon et service de qualité!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was below average, empty booths and you make sit at a small table. Drinks need to come out faster. Average at best!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start, that's how good the food (and the service) is at Diablos! The cocktail/drinks menu is fun, colorful and quite tasty - my personal favs are the saltwater cowboy (spiced rum, melon liqueur, orange juice & ginger ale) and the Shark Attack (vodka, pink lemonade and grenadine). As for the food, well, I went with a fairly large group and ended up trying a little bit of everything. And lucky us, we got to sit out on their lovely little terrace.

The jalapeno poppers were the big winner for me in terms of appetizers. The hush puppies were just ok, a teeny tiny bit dry and lacking in seasoning - though serving it with a side of hickory smoke flavored BBQ sauce makes up for the lack of zing.

The hands down winner is the beef brisket \"chili\". The brisket gets twelve hours with the chef's secret spice rub, twelve hours in the smoker and then at least another day simmering in the richest, smokiest, most flavorful tomato based chili sauce I've ever tasted. A guaranteed foodgasm for even the most jaded palate. The mac and cheese is bold and sharp and topped with chorizo (and who doesn't love chorizo, right?!). The pulled pork is moist and smoky and sweet. The fried chicken is amazingly crisp. The pork ribs fall off the bone and are coated in a deliciously smokey BBQ sauce. Please note, the full portion is humungous - order the half rack unless you plan on sharing or taking leftovers home with you. All of the mains are served with your choice of two sides; my favorites were the jalapeno cornbread and the potato salad but the maquechoux (braised corn, sweet bell peppers, onions & tomatoes) was a top pick with several other guests.

For dessert we all shared a few slices of the bourbon pecan pie. Served slightly warm, it was a big hit with everyone. Not too sweet, made with plenty of butter, and the crust was unlike anything I've ever had. Less like a pie crust and more like a shortbread cookie. Yum! The portions are generous and the prices are VERY reasonable.

I suggest making a reservation, if only because the food is so good that pretty soon you won't be able to get in without one. Our group had a great time chatting with the staff, the owner, and we even got to meet the chef. Here's hoping they take our suggestion to heart and put collared greens on the menu!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for BBQ in Montreal! 
Everything I tried is succulent, and offers that southern twist. I would highly recommend the Shrimp Po'boy. The pricing here is also reasonable, and each plate offers you your choice of a southern style. 

Great terrace in the back and a fun selection of original drinks!"}
{"text":"Was hyped to try some spicy hot chili but unfortunately they were out of just about  everything... no chili, no wings, and no pulled pork. I fought my instinct to leave and gave the Diablo burger a try, it was underwhelming, undercooked, missing ingredients with 2 small unseeded jalapenos with no kick whatsoever. I'll probably give them another shot but this was not a good experience."}
{"text":"I feel it is my civic duty to warn you away from Diablo's barbecue house on St Denis. I've eaten there twice now, and both experiences can be described with the exact same phrase: a clusterfuck of sheer ineptitude.

I really wanted to like this no-frills smokehouse, but it would seem that the majority of the aforementioned smoke is, unfortunately, coming out of the kitchen staff's ineptitude.

The first time I went was at lunch on a Friday. The place was empty, but it still took us over an hour to get our food, which was mediocre at best.

The second time was this evening... Diablo's is currently winning Montreal Burger week, so we thought we'd check it out. I have to say that, after tonight, I have no idea how this victory came about, because they managed to totally mess up our order... twice.

Having queued for half an hour to get a table, we then waited for half an hour for a waitress to take our order, followed by another half hour wait for our drinks to arrive. Half an hour after that, we actually got our food. We had ordered their Burger Week special, The Cheesus, which was described to us as a deliciously seasoned beef burger, cooked, then battered and flash fried, served with smoked ketchup, chicken fried steak sauce, three slices of bacon and, instead of a bun, fried Haloumi cheese. Wow! That sounds pretty good, non? Except when our burgers arrived (after two hours of waiting) there was only one piece of Haloumi \"bun\" so we couldn't pick them up. We sent the order back, and we got brand new Cheesuses, quick smart. We started to tuck in and realized that there was neither any batter, nor bacon, and the burgers were dry and relied on an ocean of sauce to deliver any flavour. Seriously? This was supposed to be a prize-winning burger experience, not two hours of waiting followed by a double cock-up and bitter disappointment.
Not to mention the fries were cold with order 1, and overcooked on order 2.

The manager did comp our drinks,and did his best to apologize but the damage was done - after two and a half hours of waiting for what can only be described as a flavourless gimmick, and having to send it back, it was the least he can do. 

Avoid. And make the trek to Blackstrap BBQ, whose food and ambience are miles better than this."}
{"text":"After reading reviews of Diablos BBQ I was definitely looking forward to a manly experience (after all it was Man Night).  We all were hungry - a group of 8. We were seated quickly as there weren't many people in the small restaurant. 

Dishes tasted: 
Chicken wings - Same bbq sauce as ribs. After awhile you get tired of the very sweet taste. Portion size was good.
Pulled pork entree - you receive three bite size pieces of a sweet cookie stuffed with pulled pork. The meat is delicious. The cookie does not compliment the dish at all. Very dry and undesirable.
Rib and chicken combo - Chicken was moist but too crispy and lacking flavour. The ribs have that bbq sauce that you get tired of quick, too sweet.
Cole slaw - Very good.
Potato Salad - Lack luster.
Hamburger - AWFUL. Very dry, almost inedible. Sounded great in the menu but was the worse part of the experience, avoid!

The service was slow - possibly due to the table size - but very helpful and polite. The atmosphere is great for St Denis street. With better food I can imagine myself hanging at the bar munching on appetizers.

The price was acceptable. Typical prices for the area.


Without any major change to the food I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"We showed up at 7:30 pm on Tuesday with a restaurant half empty & it took 15 min to get a beer and over an hour to get a sandwich!  Kudos to the blonde chick who never stopped moving & was bartender as well as waitress.  Not sure what was happening with the cook staff but an hour for a sandwich of pre-cooked meat is ridiculous. 
This place seems perfect if you want a trendy drink, a smoke and old hip hop music. 
Owner please take note; the manager sat at a table with friends at least 50 % of the time we were there & did nothing to help staff struggling in the kitchen or back up the bartender/waitress.  A manager he is not.  A manager should actually work harder than their staff.
The food was good when it finally arrived but a pickle appetizer, 2 beers , 2 sandwiches cost us 60$
Simply said NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"I absolutely love BBQ and was really excited to try Diablo's. I have been to Bofinger's and was not really impressed, I was hoping for better luck with this one.

I was craving a pulled pork sandwich last week and decided to drop in to get one since it's not too far from home.

It was a quiet afternoon, I was greeted my a friendly girl who handed me a menu. I was then told that they were out of pulled pork tacos and chili.

It is a cute, quaint little restaurant, with a nice, homey feel,  goo goo dolls was playing and it has a relaxed feel to the place which was nice. They also have a terasse on the back which would be enjoyable as well.

I orderd the pulled pork sandwich with extra BBQ sauce because I tend to like things saucy, it came with a side, I chose the potato salad.

It was ready in about 10 minutes and the cook personally handed me my bag with a friendly  smile, wishing me  a good lunch and  a happy belly.

It is nice to have friendly people cook and serve you your food, always appreciated:)

I sat in my car and decided to have a highly anticipated bite and I sadly was disappointed. The meat was tender but on the mushy side and the bbq sauce was missing a smoky kick. It was good but by no means a heavenly sensory experience like a great bbq  usually is to me.

The potato sald was creamy and refreshing and quite tasty.

I really wanted to like this place, I really did but it was not to be. I may eventually go back to try the baby back ribs but, all in all, Diablo's did not measure up to my Southern BBQ tastes."}
{"text":"The experience was so bad that I felt compelled to sign up to Yelp to voice my concerns on this place. 

Despite the mixed reviews from previous yelpers we went ahead to this restaurant in search of juicy ribs and other southern style food. this was a recommendation by the turisme-montreal.com blog (who i beleive are paid for their biased reviews after this). Upon entering we were greeted by a tattooed waiter which suited the vibe of the indoor bar. unfortunately it all went downhill from there.

waiting 5 minutes just to get a menu, they were received covered in beer, soaking my arms. not good. Then requesting an English menu as we can't read french (tourists) we were presented with a scrunched, food stained menu resembling a used piece of toilet paper. 

Ordering was tricky because they had run out of their beef ribs. What the hell. We settled for pork ribs and fried chicken with a starter of pulled pork sliders.
The sliders never came! they forgot about them and we were just presented with our mains. 

Inedible!! our pork ribs were SO overcooked it was like eating bark. the sauce was charred so badly, the meat void of any moisture. the bones just broke away (a sign of over cooked rib).  There was actually no sauce. none! just char. 

Sweet potato fries as a side? HA. more like regular fries with a few sweet potato ones mixed in. Just like the other reviewer said. 

Corn bread was some dried , crumbly bread with no flavour or jalapenos. ive always had corn bread as a side to a gravy or sauce based dish for mopping. as fried chicken is dry, and ribs were cooked until it formed bark, the bread couldn't be complimented with anything. 

The waiter then decided to take her dinner break while we were eating (only 2 tables eating at this time) so we were left hanging for the bill for wayyy to long. only when we got the attention of the other waiter could we request the bill and leave this overpriced  disappointmemt of a BBQ joint. 

I was very excited about this place after reading about it on the tourisme-Montreal.com blog. but left with disappointment in not only the poor quality restaurant, but the reputation of that blog to which I've followed for over a year now.

Walk up the road to RUBS on Price Arthur if you want some good BBQ."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night with 8 people, they where barely able to sit us, we had to to wait 10 minutes and once we sat we where very tight and uncomfortable.

On a good note, the service was great and the waiters were very nice to us. The music was good, perhaps a little too loud, but enjoyable atmosphere nonetheless.

Now onto the food. overall i was just ok . I had the cajun shrimp Po boy with a side of potato salad. The bread was great, moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. The shrimp was well cooked and the jalapeño mayo sauce was pretty good. The potato salad on the other hand not so great. Some were undercooked, too salty and I felt like them being served cold from the fridge took away from most of their flavor. 

My concern however was when I got the bill. A small burger and mediocre side dish  with a beer came up to 30$. For what I paid for, I don't think I'll be eating burgers there any time soon. 

All in all it was an enjoyable evening with great friends but the food was disappointing. I would recommend getting some type of BBQ dish instead."}
{"text":"I'd first heard of Diablo's thanks to MTL Burger Week.  Though I didn't try their artery-clogging deep fried burger creation, it did spark my interest in trying out the place.  I was interested to see if their creativity carried over to their regular daily menu as well.

Place:  Diablo's is a comfy, low lit spot with plenty of seating for couple and larger groups.  It also features a bar that seats around 8 people.  They also have an outdoor seating area that I didn't get to take a look at.  It's a good BBQ/bar atmosphere with groups of 20-30 somethings enjoying themselves.   

Food:  Along with a large variety of BBQ options, Diablo's serves some of the largest mixed drinks I've ever seen outside of Vegas and New Orleans.  These $40 bad boys   will definitely put a hurting on you.  I stuck with one of their smaller libations and we each ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  I ordered a side of corn bread and my partner in crime went with the smashed potatoes.

The pulled pork was solid, but not spectacular.  The corn bread was rather small, cold and neither butter nor honey was offered.  The smashed potatoes lacked flavor and we had to resort to dumping in some salt to liven things up.

Service:  We popped in on a Friday night at 8pm without a reservation and no tables were available, so we sat at the bar.  The host who seated us did a great job of making us feel welcome and explaining to us the house speciality drinks and menu items.  Our bartender was prompt with our drinks and also kindly took our dinner orders. 

Price: ~$40 for two dinners and two mixed drinks.  Fair, but a bit expensive for the quality. 

Though I enjoyed the service and ambiance of the place, but if I come back it will be for the massive mixed drinks and not the food."}
{"text":"Second visit. Service was much better this time as the waitress didn't seem quite as overwhelmed. Ordered the fried chicken this time... I was really looking forward to some fried chicken... until it arrived. They seem to be using some sort of corn flake or bread crumb coating on their fried chicken, which was crunchy, but didn't really seal the chicken and give it the juiciness that you would expect from a batter fried chicken. So fair warning... don't expect batter fried chicken, which is a shame, because I would have left smiling wickedly for days... I love fried chicken. They also don't seem to stock honey for the fried chicken. The ribs were a bit dry. The jalapeno poppers were spicy and hot. The fried pickles were good. The pecan pie was great, not overly spicy. Soft drinks (well at least my Coke Zero) was bottled, which makes for a bit of a skimpy pour, great way to sell more, but disappointing if you only want one. Still love that jalapeno corn bread!

The restaurant is good and with a few tweaks could be great. I wouldn't order the fried chicken again, which is a shame considering how few places in Montreal actually serve fried chicken. It is definitely something that could set them apart from other restaurants. We'll be back, but not for the chicken."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with a friend for some beer and good Southern cooking. The beer was good but I was ultimately disappointed with the food. We shared a pulled pork sandwich, a plate of baby back ribs and fried chicken.

The pulled pork sandwich was the only good thing we ate that night. The meat was tender and the bun to meat ratio was acceptable. Coleslaw as a side was traditional and served its purpose. 

The ribs were mediocre at best. It was a bit dry and the BBQ sauce had a bit too much molasses for my liking. 

The fried chicken was the worst I've had in awhile. One piece was so dry I couldn't eat it. I asked for yam fries and they gave me half regular fries and a small portion of yam fries. Sigh. 

The service was awesome but I don't think I'll be coming back here unless it's for the pulled pork. Let's hope they improve."}
{"text":"Ca m'attriste vraiment d'avoir a faire ça, mais je suis obligée.

Les 3 dernières fois ou on est allés (dans l'espace de 2 mois environ) c'était vraiment, mais vraiment décevant. Dire que c'était une de mes places préférées avant !! Premièrement, l'ambiance. C'est vide et triste. Ou est la musique ? Ou est l'entrain des serveuses ? Malgré le manque de clientèle, le service est au ralenti. Et quand je dis au ralenti, je veux dire 45 minutes pour nos drinks et 1h ++ pour notre nourriture. Une chance qu'en bonne compagnie le temps passe plus vite... Le menu des drinks doit être mis à jour puisqu'ils ne servent plus de bière en bouteille donc leur fameux drinks géants ne sont plus disponibles ! 

Parlant de la bouffe...le menu doit aussi être mis à jour. J'ai l'impression que de faire un blackboard avec des spéciaux du jour serait plus avantageux pour eux puisque plusieurs items ne sont pas au menu (et ne l'étaient toujours pas les autres fois ou nous sommes retournés, ce qui me fait craindre le pire) Je parle bien sûr du fameux Brisket. En toute honnêteté, c'est le plat que je préfère et je suis vraiment déçue qu'ils n'osent pas dire qu'ils l'ont enlevé du menu puisqu'il n'y en a virtuellement jamais. Les ribs sont devenues tellement ordinaires que même celles du st-hubert sont meilleures. Le macaroni au fromage contient à peine 3-4 morceaux de chorizo alors qu'avant il en était plein. Ils ne font plus les frites de patates douces. 

Ma question : Qu'est-ce qui se passe Diablo's ? Un petit blues ? Je suis une cliente fidèle qui s'en vient pas mal déçue et qui ne recommande plus votre resto à mes amis. Il est temps de prendre ça en main !"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Saturday afternoon.  Was very quiet at about 2pm and got a table on the back terrace.  Ordered a couple appetizers first, the jalapeno poppers and the mac & cheese with sausage.  Both were very good and recommended.  I decided on the half rack of pork ribs and they are easily the best ribs I've had in Montreal and I've tried Bofingers, Le Fumoir and another place in the Burgundy area but can't remember the name.  Diablos ribs were far superior to those other establishments.  The two sides I ordered, one was a mixture of corn and red peppers I think and it began with an M, it was very good but can't remember what it was called and the website is down now.  I also ordered the potato salad which was not memorable at all.  If there was a low light to this experience it was definitely the bland potato salad.  

My friend ordered the Shimp Po-Boy  and that too was delicious with colossal shrimp and a great sandwich.  Overall, a definite recommend from me."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Diablos.  Staff was more than accommodating; their claim to fame are their huge 25 oz cocktails.  They don't usually serve their mojito that way but were more than happy to make one for us.  It was delicious!  Full of fresh lime juice and mint, not too sweet.

The food was great too.  I loved my sliders of corn bread and pulled pork.  The only thing that could have made it better would be if they served the jalapeno corn bread as the buns.  My boyfriend had their traditional pulled pork sandwich which he loved.  

To top it off they have an awesome patio out back.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Secon time here! It's amazing. Had a coupon for 50% off for fried pickles! It was delicious! The pork sliders were amazing as well! Last time I had the brisket! It was delicious. If u want to impress you visiting  friends bring them here! They will love it."}
{"text":"Their brunch is very disappointing.  I went there this morning with my wife and they didn't have half the things available on the menu.  Even though we were the only 2 people in the restaurant, it took us 40min to get served and the waitress never came to see us for coffee, we had to get up to go ask her every single time.  Finally, their ham was ridiculously dry and stale.  I highly do not recommend their brunch."}
{"text":"A must do when in the Latin quarter! The owners are too cool and very hospitable! The ribs and sauce are on hit! Eat on the deck, people watch, drink out in the air and grub! I love the this place and now you know!"}
{"text":"The venue looks exceptionally well and inviting, I'm a big fan of the theme they have going on and might I add the best Mashed potatoes I ever had was from Diablos and the beef ribs were succulent and the slush cocktail I ordered( can't recall the name) was to die for. Staff was cool as well and unlike other similar restaurants they were not stingy in the portions, my only con was the french fries are pretty generic but everything else I ordered I highly enjoyed.

I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Went here twice on my recent trip to Montreal and had completely different meals each time.

Chili - meaty with chunks of tomato. Not Texas at all but delicious nonetheless.
Collards - not southern at all but enjoyable. Not too bitter and an excellent compliment to the meaty chili.
Garlic smashed potato - really good! Imagine a baked potato that someone split open, added some garlic and butter to, and then punched once or twice. Perfectly smashed and seasoned. 

Brisket - moist, tender, delicious but not a classic Texas flavor.
Jalapeno corn bread - moist with visible pieces of corn and jalapeno. Really good.
Coleslaw - minimally dressed and perfect compliment to the brisket.

I had a few cocktails as well and enjoyed all of them (especially at their price point!). The 5-7/happy hour is wonderful and they have several special nights during the week. Service was excellent and eating out on the 2nd floor terrace was very relaxing."}
{"text":"I was delightfully surprised by the southern comfort food and hospitality. I especially devoured the BBQ pork chop. The staff is friendly and foodie savvy. Get extra napkins... Or just lick your fingers. It's that delicious. Seriously addictive!"}
{"text":"pretty poor service, we and another table of 10 left after waiting for over 1hr and still no food or response.
staff looks not really experienced, manager walks around grumpy with a killer face. too bad, missed opportunity."}
{"text":"I loved this place! My friend and I were grabbing a beer after work, and he suggested we head over to try the friend chicken on a waffle! Well, after realizing upon arrival that this was a brunch item served on Sundays, we settled in to pore over the menu. Wow. I wanted everything!

Before I get ahead of myself, the décor was great! For a Louisiana style BBQ joint, I found my surroundings tastefully classy but also a real draw with the home style paper towel roll, and serve-yourself cutlery jars per table! Cute little tea light lanterns and old fashioned water jugs with cork tops finished off the look pretty neatly! The lighting was muted, and felt like a real back patio BBQ with the string lights and wooden ambiance! 

Émilie, our server, was very friendly and accommodating, and suggested we go for $4.99 pints of Rolling Rock (beer lover here, and RR was a great accompaniment for the grub style at this establishment, served in the appropriate glass. I was pleased, and my thirst was quenched!) 

We ordered an appetizer of deep-friend pickle slices. MAN they were awesome and a half. I have had breaded, fried pickles before, but something about the light, crispy breading, and the hot, tart, brininess of the pickle just really did it for me! I dipped a few in ranch too, cuz that's how I roll! :)

After much deliberation over the awesome menu, I decided to order the pulled pork ravioli. Bummer, when I asked what the sauce was, I was told they were out of the ravioli at the moment. Another day! I'm totally curious! I ordered the Rapture sandwich instead (awesome name!), which had ham, bacon, goat cheese, and guacamole I believe (I can't seem to locate an online menu atm). They were out of guacamole as well, but I asked them to sub for something creamy like mayo or ranch. Absolutely to die for, whatever was subbed! Dan in the kitchen you rock! Also, the thick style bread was so soft and amazing! Dug it to the max! 

My friend ordered fried chicken (he had to resolve the no-waffle-chicken craving that prompted our visit). It was unbelievably light and crisply-breaded, and moist to boot! He took a side of amaaaazing SMASHed (nice big chunks, not completely puréed) garlic potatoes. I don't know what magic happened there, but they were phenom. Lemon? Something wicked fresh along with the garlic, perhaps? No idea - mais très bon. Both of us had a side of collards cooked in a light, fresh bacon grease! Absolutely wicked flavour. As it was my first time having collards, it reminded me of having greens (back in Newfoundland) with a southern flair! 

All in all, a fantastic evening and I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Je ne veux pas être trop nostalgique, mais je fréquentais beaucoup plus la rue St-Denis durant mes années de collège au début des années '80. St-Denis \"en bas\" (de Sherbrooke) était mon parcours régulier entre le CEGEP du Vieux-Montréal et le métro Berri et les restos, cafés et bars sur mon parcours étaient des arrêts réguliers. Oui, déjà à l'époque les plus vieux trouvaient que ça n'avait pas le charme des années '60, mais la plupart des établissements étaient petits, pas chers et indépendants. Aujourd'hui, c'est le royaume des chaînes, des prix élevés et des établissements visant les touristes.

Dans ce contexte, j'ai trouvé rafraîchissant de passer une soirée chez Diablo BBQ, un établissement indépendant et original. Boudant les concepts de chaînes et de la nourriture industrielle, Diablos exploite un fumoir sur place ou ils fument à point des spécialités BBQ succulentes et originales. L'endroit est petit et chaleureux. L'ambiance et le service sont incroyables. Une bonne raison de revenir sur St-Denis en bas!"}
{"text":"Can't recommend this place enough.  Been there 4 times now and have been blown away 4 times.  After eating here, I never want to eat Bofingers again.  The brisket isn't for the tame of pallet.  Pulled pork just dripping sweet and spicy.  Ribs seemingly straight off the brontosaurus.  Never had maquchoux before, but definitely a find.  Distillerie style drinks, with the same love of Sailor Jerry as I have!  Cheap pints of Rolling Rock to top it off.  I've been waiting for a place like this ever since my trip to Texas a few years back and it's finally delivered!"}
{"text":"I've been to Diablo's twice now and I have to say I think it's really going downhill. The first time I was there (in the fall of 2013 I believe) we had an amazing jalapeno poppers appetizer and I had a delicious (albeit pretty greasy) sandwich. We also had some strong, good-tasting and relatively affordable drinks. There was a nice selection. The service was good.

Second time around (last week) things got weird. For some reason the menu was printed on a regular weight 8x11 piece of paper without anything sturdy to hold it and was significantly reduced from last time, meaning that if you have any dietary preferences, your options are pretty narrow. The waitress announced right away that they didn't have any nachos or brisket that day (really? no brisket at a BBQ joint?) and it was only about 8pm by then. The women next to us were loudly complaining that they had been waiting for over an hour and went to see the kitchen staff, who were evidently not working and chatting around. We didn't have to wait as long (maybe 20-30min) and weren't in a rush so I won't complain about that.

Finally, our food arrived and it looked really delicious. I got a side of coleslaw and cornbread. Both were AWFUL, and I am very far from a picky eater. I love coleslaw in all its forms, but I couldn't take more than a bite of this one, it was thickly cut, bitter, and drenched in some gross mayo sauce. The cornbread tasted like it was 2 weeks old, couldn't eat that either. My main was the mac&cheese and I cannot complain, it was dee-licious! I was really disappointed to have to pay 15$ for a dish I barely ate because it was so bad though. The waitress was aloof and not attentive but I wouldn't say the service was bad.

Unfortunately, I doubt I'll come back again, although to be honest, considering it was 75% empty at 8pm on a Friday, I'm not sure how long it will be around."}
{"text":"The only good think about this meal were the ribs.  The ribs very very tender and flavourful.  Pulled pork was good although the portion size was extremely small.  The fried chicken was awful!  Dry, overly crunchy, and the only think you can taste is smoke.  The portions were very small for the price.  For a $65 meal I expected a lot better."}
{"text":"Me and my friends had gone there on a Friday and we didn't know we needed reservations but the staff was more than accommodating and found us a table inside. The atmosphere was sweet I loved it instantly.

Our waitress was a doll and so were the other employees. Very kind and helpful in explaining there menu.

I love anything veggie, I ordered there veggie sandwich with grilled vegetables and goat cheese and the mixed fries and it was amazing great flavors and so filling.
The boys got ribs and more meat and they loved it! I will def need to try the ribs next time. Oh! and my cocktail was so tasty can't go wrong with Vodka and Slush! (lavender May) was the name of it. 

Overall great experience can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"J y ai été mangé hier pour faire plaisir à ma blonde qui adore les ribs. Le résultat était vraiment tres decevant pour le prix payé.(21$ HT) Je conseillerais à n importe qui d aller allieurs pour manger des ribs car elles étaient de toute evidencent réchauffées et sèches.Meme les ailes de poulets etaient tres limitent . Apres savoir lu les critiques je croyais faire une belle decouverte mais malheureusement pas.Je n y retournerais personellement pas car Montreal à mieux à offerir."}
{"text":"You know you're in trouble when your stomach is screaming NO MAS! and your mind is pleading 'I want more it tastes so good'. 
Having been for a Yelp event my SO and I went back for our anniversary. He's even pickier than I am and loved the fried chicken and the omg it's got to be illegal somewhere beef rib and collared greens. Sad to say fellow Yelpers I got the very last portion of pulled pork ravioli as they're taking it off the menu. The corn bread was perfect. The chopped salad not so much but it was a good palate cleanser so I could wolf down the delightful mac n cheese with chorizo sausage. 
The drinks are first rate and, as we went on a quiet Tuesday night, the service was truly amazing. Great to see Chef Jason again and chat. 
HELPFUL TIP: If you want food avoid going Friday or Saturday night.  The place gets really packed; mostly with a drinking crowd. They are primarily a bar especially on those nights and the food that does get served can disappear really fast. 
As we were sooooo stuffed dessert will have to wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Ca me peine de mettre 2 etoiles, mais c'est la triste realite! Ce n'etait pas mon premier choix car il y avait beaucoup d'avis negatifs, mais j'aime essayer et juger par moi meme. 

Service et ambiance; 4 etoiles, serveuse sympatique et beau decors, mais on a du damander de l'eau et redemander quelques trucs! C'etait quand meme pas trop long! 

Nourriture: rapport qualite/prix: 1 etoile! Les mots qui me viennent sont; mauvais, vieux, insignifiant, pas de saveur ! 

J'ai pris le poulet frit, papates a l'ail et pain au mais: premierement la cuisson et le croustillant du poulet etait parfaite. Par contre, le poulet comme la panure avaient pas de gout, meme pas du sel et poivre ? Ca goutait le poulet nature jamais mariné ! Mes patates manquaient d'ail, sel et poivre. Et que dire de mon pain de mais, sec, vieux!  Pour un repas plus breuvage sans alcool: 25$ tout inclus :-( 

J'ai aussi gouté aux cotes levee de mon ami, on aurait dit du carton, j'ai eu de la misere a avaler! 

Pour moi c'est non non non, faites moi confiance, manger du mcdo a la place!"}
{"text":"Great, great, great southern BBQ. Side dishes were a little small, but what they lacked in size they made up for in flavour. Well done!

Update: the coleslaw was AWESOME."}
{"text":"I headed there for the BBQ, but when I saw fried chicken on the menu, I changed my mind.  The outdoor patio was pretty full but the owner/manager moved his laptop and accounts and everything off a table and gave it to me. - party of one. Nice. The waitress was friendly to an english only customer. The chicken however was a large disappointment. Not breaded but covered in crunchy corn flakes or something.  The menu said buttermilk but I tasted none. In fact the chicken was completely lacking in any taste at all. I might try it again and give the BBQ a chance this time. And watch the stairs entering and leaving the hand rail is not the steadiest."}
{"text":"Came here with some quick savvy Yelpers who tipped me off to this new BBQ joint on St Denis, so I'm grinning to be grabbing the first, MWHAHA. I owe you a shot of Jameson for crashing your dates, but I heart you all. 

Really cute little place just getting rolling, nice mix of rockabilly texmex vibe what with the wagon wheel and bullhorns and all. Small enough to know each item you're eating had someone pay attention to it, and I do love to eat food and crack \"that's what she said\" jokes in old church pews. My Jalapeno poppers were fiery and good but could have been a little more breaded, and maybe a cheese with more kick than cream? My charming friends seemed to enjoy their pulled pork, and man size beef rib, and fries with a little sweet potato throw right in. 

Highlight was the charming Bloodshot Bill playing up front, I'm guessing this was a special occasion but yay, as ever, for live music with good food and nice people. 

Bonus points to the owner sitting nearby working the heater/ac with a remote every time we even started to think about being too hot or cold. Friendly, attentive, Rolling Rock on tap - will be back with a bigger appetite soon."}
{"text":"Update - Went back AGAIN. Had the Diablo's burger and those beautiful mixed fries. Perfect balance of regular and sweet potato fries with a great chipotle mayo

{"text":"Du nouveau à Montréal. Un des rares restaurants à offrir du confort food américain. Après l'événement Yelp, il fallait absolument que je rééssaie ce restaurant. J'ai été pour le brunch du dimanche. 10:15 nous étions déjà à la porte. Premiers clients de la journée. Le propriétaire nous accueille comme si nous étions chez lui. Il prend le temps de venir jaser avec nous. Chic type. À notre demande, il nous permet de commander des petites bouchées qui ne sont pas dans le menu du brunch du dimanche. Nous commençons donc avec du pain de maïs et un \"biscuit\" que nous partageons à 4. Ils arrivent chauds à la table et fondent en bouche. Nous avons commandé le pull pork sandwich servi avec un oeuf; fried chicken and wafle; chicken fried steak servi avec 2 oeufs. Tout était EXCELLENT. Vous ne trouverez rien qui a une faible teneur en gras. J'ai dû ramener la moitié de mon chicken and wafle, chose que je ne fais presque jamais. Les plats sont servis avec des pommes de terre rissolées avec oignons, délicieux. Je recommande à 100% et suis contente d'avoir ce type de cuisine à Montréal et en plus un accueil avec le Southern Hospitality tant connu dans le sud des États-Unis. J'y retourne sans faute pour les All you can eat ribs du lundi. Étant donné le bar, le resto est 18ans et plus."}
{"text":"Que dire...

Je suis un mordu de \" côtes levées \" et pour la première fois de ma vie, j'ai regretté moi choix. Je m'explique... J'avais l'impression de manger du carton et je n'ai pas terminé mon assiette. Bref, je n'ai jamais autant regretté un restaurant de ma vie. Au moins, la serveuse était souriante et aimable. Conclusion, trappe à touristes qui est bien localisée pour leurrer les clients."}
{"text":"Best ribs I ever had!  A few friends and I went their on a Friday night for supper and didn't have reservations so there was only some room either at the bar or on the terrace. It was cold and rainy out so didn't really want to eat outside but the staff accommodated by finding us a table in that tiny place! 

I got the beef ribs (smoked 24 hours - I think) and a buddy got the pork ribs (smoked 48 hours). They actually smoke 'em all in-house and not that fake \"smoke flavor\". They use hickory wood to smoke them and did I say best ribs I ever had?! Served with a mix of sweet potato and regular fries! I don't even remember what the other side dish was that I got but I am sure it was awesome cuz I didn't have any complaints. The portions are massive! My buddy can really eat and he had some trouble finishing his ribs, I had nooooo problem helping him!

The staff are really great! When our original waitress was busy, someone else jumped right in and helped us. Great team of folks over there!

Their drink menu has like 80-90 different cocktails in it. Not really my style by my friend is and she loved the drinks. I'd go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I been here a multitude of times .
A very cheery , \"Hey ! How ya doing ??\" kind of place.
A ton of friendly hot looking staff! Shadowed by aw-some rock and roll Punk!
You get a good view of the drunken terrace below. 
Get a beer because , you will need time to decide what to eat
 Oh boy can you eat!! 
All the good stuff from Mac & Cheese, Fried Chicken , BB Ribs  and just basically pure food grade happiness.!


Stop what you are doing , get off your butt and go there 
Right now !!!"}
{"text":"I'd love to say I'm crazy about Diablos BBQ. You're like a very hot babe. You got all the right moves, the curves in the right places, yer dressed all nice, yer hair is silky smooth, you got long legs that just won't quit and endowments that make men dream, but we just can't date, it wouldn't feel right, we just don't mesh.

Now for the review

T H E   G O O D 
The décor is awesome; it feels like a barn square dance without the dancing. The music is like the soundtrack to a good action flick. The rock-a-Billy staff offers great service with a smile without being formal. The menu is far from cliché. You'll find items here found nowhere else in Montreal. The drinks... lots and lots of singular drinks, making this one hell of an interesting bar... seriously I could spent my pay on drinks there. Plus I love drinking out of a mason jar. I know I have no class.

T H E   B A D
Or \"T h e   n o t   s o   g o o d\". Normally I reserve my good-bad-ugly review for disaster restaurant experiences. This wasn't a disaster but it was a very divisive experience. They have some very UNIQUE menu items, one of which is the Louis Cypher - the Angel Heart reference alone made sure I was getting this - is a homemade CORNDOG - been waiting for this for years - made of sausage with cheese dredged with a thick tasty batter. How is this bad you ask? Deep fried battered sausage, that's the dream man. Unfortunately, there was so much batter on the sucker that the batter wasn't cooked through and the sausage at best was bordering on cold. I was utterly disappointed since my anticipation was sky-high. There was also cornbread, dry and crumbly, still tasty, but no punch to it.

Diablos BBQ offers the ultimate southern steak, the Chicken Fried Steak. It's like fried chicken but with a slab of cow. It's battered and dredged and deep fried as is it were chicken and slathered with a peppered white sauce (aka béchamel) and comes from the German settlers who transformed their Wiener Schnitzel to adapt to what was available in cattle country. It's so awesome it's even served for breakfast with eggs down south. Mind-blowing stuff - which I make a pretty good version of at home. Unfortunately the batter seemed to be made of pepper only and I couldn't take more than my first bite. Fortunately the manager agreed with me and there was discussion of the prep cook and a wood chipper, but I digress. Of course I couldn't get the fried chicken, same dredge. 

T H E   V E R D I C T
Again I want to love this place and there so many things to love. The staff, the bar, the menu, the presentation, the atmosphere, those French fries are in a whole world of awesome by themselves. The slaw is made to order because the creamy dressing hasn't softened the crunchy cabbage. The ribs I had as a replacement for the chicken friend stake were pretty damn good - though they got nothin' on Blackstrap BBQ. Oh and yeah, Whoopie Pies. 


I'll also add that the service far exceeded my expectations for this type of place. The manager was very open minded and took note of my criticism and offered to on-the-house my next chicken fried steak. True pros all the way. Can't say that enough.

To be re-reviewed in the future. I ain't giving up on it yet."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ, the Collard greens were great, fried chicken good and beef rib tasty.  It's definitely a good option when in this area.  

Staff was friendly and the decor was cool, this is a even better place to hang out at during the summer as they have a covered patio out back."}
{"text":"I am a fan of good BBQ so when I heard about Diablo's I wanted to try it out.  Situated in the heart of the Latin Quarter it is quite small on the inside but has a nice terrasse.  The service here is quick and friendly.

Foodwise I tried the deep-fried pickles which came with a dill-seasoned dipping sauce and I liked them quite a bit.  I followed it up with a Cajun shrimp Poboy with coleslaw.  The shrimp were nicely seasoned and had a good kick to them.  I also liked the coleslaw quite a bit.

The cocktails are also worth trying.  They have some served in Mason jars and it's hard to chose which one you want.  I had the Saltwater Cowboy and the Hurricane which were watered down a bit but still pretty good.

I was disappointed that they were out of quite a few options on the menu.  I had originally wanted corn bread as my side but was told they were out.  Had it been closer to closing time I would have understood however it was early enough in the night that they should have had them.

The place is cash only so make sure you have enough when you go.  Also I'd recommend a reservation.  We didn't have one but since the terrasse was open we got a seat .   The dining room though is on the small side so when the terrasse is closed I can imagine getting a seat would be tough."}
{"text":"After a good year's wait in between my first visit to Diablos, I decided it'd be a good time to give it another shot with my girlfriend, and we invited my dad along for the ride. Diablos was my choice destination for the long awaited first terrace of the summer.

Decor:
The inside of the restaurant isn't anything to hype about, just a typical bar type scene, which would be a little crowded if it were full. Good thing they have a terrace though, and it was newly rennovated! They had banquets along the entire right side, and small 2 person tables on the left. They had cute little lanterns from Ikea and some nice overhead lights overtop each table on the terrace, which I thought was really cool. On a warm night, it'd be a great place to just hang out and enjoy the ambiance.

Service:
Our waitress was okay, she didn't really go out of her way for us or do anything out of the ordinary, she came and took our drink orders, food orders, brought the food, the bill, and that was that. We weren't informed until we were seated at the table and ordering drinks that they were not accepting credit card or debit cards due to a system crash.

Food/Drinks:
The drinks menu, by far one of the best drinks menus in the city. VERY expansive, moreso then their food menu. Unfortunately some of their equipment wasn't working, so I couldn't get any of the slushy drinks. All the drinks come with a beautiful garnish of different fruits, fresh mint, etc, and they come in mason jars, which my gf absolutely loves. We had to take pictures when the drinks came to the table, they were so colorful and full of life, and they tasted fantastic.

The food on the other hand, mediocre at best. I was feeling a little daring and decided it would be my cheat day, as someone who has begun watching what I eat, the devil side won and made me order their '6th Sin' burger, which happened to win #4 on last years top burgers of Montreal 2012. The burger was deep fried.. The ENTIRE BURGER was battered and deep fried. I cut it open and it looked lucious on the inside. They advertise it to come with a special smoked ketchup, and home made radish relish and cucumbers (pickles), but honestly I didn't taste any of that. They put way too much cheese in it, and I found myself putting additional regular heinz ketchup on it to give it that little tangy kick. I couldn't finish it, the deep fried batter in the end proved to be too much. I decided to opt with the sweet potato fries/french fries mix as a side dish, as I remembered last year when I came I had the cornbread and mac and cheese and was sorely disappointed. They were thin-cut and a little over-seasoned but they had a nice texture. My girlfriend ordered the smoked chicken, however she didn't really find it appealing, it tasted like nothing but smoke, and it wasn't a good smokey flavor, it was one that lingered in your mouth for a while. Good thing we had the drinks to wash it down.

Overall opinion:
I wouldn't come back here for the food. Maybe I'd have a poutine or something to accompany a few rounds of drinks if I was really feeling a need to eat something. Diablos would do well if they just stayed open late and served drinks all night. I would definitely sit out on that terrace all night, sharing an assortment of drinks with my nearest and dearest.

3 stars, and only for the drinks. The food is nothing to brag about, there are far better BBQ joints in town."}
{"text":"Went to Diablo's for the first time today thanks to an online voucher deal and I'm quite pleased.

Location wise, this area is booming, lots of nice terraces, bars and restaurant. At first glance, I thought this place was bigger but it occupies the second floor of a building and has a really nice back terrace. There's also live music on Tuesdays and Saturdays.
The whole vibe of the restaurant is fun, pretty pin up girls, Hello sailor, American nostalgia. The decor is rustic, simple. Maybe a little bit so, their outdoor tables are made of untreated wood and if you're not careful,  you could get splinters.
There's a wooden tool box on every table that holds salt/pepper and condiments. Big rolls of paper towels signal something deliciously messy is on the way.

We started with drinks - Saltwater Cowboy and Shark Attack, both served in mason jars with colorful straws and fruits. My \"Cowboy\" was really strong whereas the Shark tasted like a sweet lemonade, very easy to drink. By the way, the pictures of the drinks on the menu don't always correspond to what you'll get. For example, Shark Attack is a Barbie pink grenadine based drink, although it was pictured as yellow.

Many unique cocktails to choose from, all so appealing,  I'll definitely be going back just to try them at the very least.

Main courses: we tried ribs and mac and cheese. There were many side dishes to choose from, we chose garden salad, corn bread and a mix of sweet potato and regular fries.
Pretty much everything was delicious, although the mac and cheese which is made of Parmesan and Emmental - I found that to be a bit too pungent for my taste buds. It's definitely not a mac and cheese kids will love although if you're looking for a kick, they also have it with blue cheese.
Next time I'll also opt for strictly sweet potato fries as they seemed a lot more moist in the inside and crispy on the outside.

We didn't order desserts as they only had a pecan pie and Sailor Jerry rum ice cream at the moment. Selection is lacking but they are working on it!

Service was prompt and efficient. They seem to be training a lot of staff and there were no shortage of waitresses around to help you.

There were so many other yummy menu items, I'll be going again as I'm looking forward to trying some fried chicken, tacos, Poboy sandwiches and pulled pork.

Overall great smokehouse, southern style cuisine and fun environment. Just the name itself, Diablo's is a win for me."}

{"text":"Un nouveau resto à Montréal qui profite de la vague \"à la mode\" de la bouffe à la texane. J'adore que cette nourriture semble faire surface ici à Montréal et nous montre que le poulet frit, c'est bien plus de PFK et ça peut être délicieux sans dégoûter d'huile et de panure. Le menu de Diablo's suggère d'un peu de tous les classiques avec une twist originale, comme le pain au mais avec jalapeños et fromage Monterey Jack. La nourriture comme telle était pas mal bonne. J'ai pris le sandwich au porc effiloché qui fondait dans la bouche comme il le devrait avec une super sauce fumée. L'assiette avait l'air correct et le placement de la bouffe donnait l'impression qu'elle était à moitié vide, mais je n'ai simplement pas été capable de la terminée, donc on peut bien dire que les premières impressions sont trompeuses ici. Les cocktails sont bons et différents une fois de plus avec certains qui ont des noms douteux, mais comiques."}
{"text":"A couple of Sundays ago and in the mood for a nice spot to enjoy the weather, I was tasked to pick a restaurant in the latin Quarter for me and some friends. Given that everyone likes BBQ, I decided that we'd try out Diablos BBQ, a new-ish place located on St-Denis between Ontario and De Maisonneuve. Now, this was the same weekend where I tried out Dinette Triple Crown, so Diablos had much to live up to.

We arrived around 1:30 and were surprised to find that we were the only ones there! A little strange but the gay pride parade had just ended so maybe the lack of people was a function of that but either way, for the entire time we were there, no other patrons showed up. The restaurant is relatively small inside with the look and feel of a southern style BBQ place. However, they have an awesome terrasse outback which was one of the same reasons we went that day.

To start, I had the pulled pork sliders because, as I mentioned previously, the quality of a BBQ place's pulled pork says a lot about the restaurant to me. The sliders were okay. The pulled pork was good texturally however it lacked sauce somewhat and was a little on the cold side temperature wise. The cornbread was well done but given its nature dry and dense nature, the lack of sauce with the pork was all the more glaring.

As a main, I went with the abattoir burger which is an 1lb patty formed with equal portions of beef, veal and pork. The burger is served with the option of a number of sides. I chose to go with the coleslaw because I really didn't feel like eating fries at that moment which incidentally were quite good having picked a few from my friends. Anyway, the patty was perfectly cooked and quite good. Again, while the burger has some BBQ sauce in it as a condiment, I definitely think it needed more. The bun was quite good as well. The coleslaw was solid - nothing really standout but nothing bad either.

Overall, Diablos BBQ was a solid meal but somewhat disappointing. I truly believe my experience at Dinette the day before really set me up for this kind of experience. The actual BBQ itself was well done. It was just the little extra touches that were missing for me on this day. If you are a fan of BBQ, I would still encourage you to check them out if you're in the area.

Cheers!"}
