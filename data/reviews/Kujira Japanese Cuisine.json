{"text":"This place is definitely one of the most unique sushi places in Toronto.   It's a bit pricier than other places but you get what you pay for. Everything was well prepared, well presented, and delicious.   I especially liked the steak sushi, lobster roll, and beef short rib.   If you're tired of those rancid cream cheese rolls at pretty much every other sushi place, check this one out."}
{"text":"Joined a few friends for lunch there last week.  Exceptional value for a Japanese restaurant situated in central Yorkville. The sashimi was fresh, and the sushi rice was well done.  This is a must try if you are in the area looking for affordable Japanese."}
{"text":"I came here with a coworker for dinner after work. The hostess was very courteous and quick to seat us. It was pouring out and there was apparently a bit of flooding in the back of the restaurant, which caused the slightest delay with our orders being taken. We honestly barely noticed the wait but the servers were deeply apologetic. The service here is terrific and so is the food. I only tried the Tuna on a Coin special roll, which was pretty unique and delicious. Will definitely be back again - soon!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group on a Friday night for a late night snack and drinks.  Very chilled out environment with upbeat electronic/lounge music playing in the background - trendy vibe to fit the trendy neighbourhood.  We were seated quickly by a very friendly hostess.    I ordered the torched salmon sashimi with mint cucumber salsa and the deep fried tiger shrimp tossed in chilli mayonnaise.  Both dishes were very tasty!    The deep fried tiger shrimp was my favourite, the spice was just enough to have a nice kick to it, and the portion was satisfying.  The torched sashimi took slightly longer but our server came by to confirm with me that it will be brought out momentarily, indicating that they did not forget the order.  The sashimi was torched to perfection - just enough to slightly cook the outmost thin layer while remaining raw inside.  My other friend ordered the sushi and sashimi set and loved it, as the fish pieces were very fresh.  I also ordered an alcoholic drink (the name escapes me) that had lychee in it and it was flavoured just right - enough lychee flavour to drown out most of the vodka taste.  Keep in mind that since these are tapas, they are meant to be smaller portions so make sure your expectations are aligned in terms of portions. Also, prices are slightly higher than usual for a Japanese restaurant but as this is a boutique restaurant situated in Yorkville, you are paying for the high quality food, chill ambience and the location.   Would recommend to anyone in Yorkville with sushi cravings!"}
{"text":"This place is now closed. It's hard to get a lot of foot traffic on Cumberland st. and unfortunately it doesn't look like this establishment was able to last.  It's unfortunate, because the food was exceptional. Definitely an interesting take on sushi and Japanese fusion food."}
{"text":"This place is closed for now. Website is still up, called them and phone line still working but nobody is picking up. Went there and the place has no furniture, and a sign says closed for maintenance."}
{"text":"- like the Facebook page kujira and get 15 percent off!  - also use the yelp to get 15% off   - book the table before going. they have a big space so group of people (10) can go as well."}
{"text":"We waited for more than 30mins before the food to come and the restaurant is about half full. They gave us complimentary sake for the wait. Overall the service is not bad.  Do not order sashimi salad, they use shredded iceberg lettuce which taste cheap and does not go with the sauce.  The torched mackerel was way over done and tasted dry.  The better dish of the night is the sushi platter and it was well presented.  Will only give two stars if only rated by food quilty."}
