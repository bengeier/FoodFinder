{"text":"Always looking for an authentic Italian restaurant and then we found La Bona Pasta tucked away in a small shopping center in Litchfield Park.  I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiano that had fresh sliced eggplant and ricotta rolled in breadcrumbs  and pan-seared and baked with mozzarela and covered in tomato marinara.  It was full of flavor and melted in my mouth, delicious.  My partner ordered the Lasagna Al Forno that had layers of fresh ricota, spinach,ground beef, lasagna noodles baked with tomato marinara and covered with mozzarela.  Verdict wonderful!  Imagine each tables with fresh flower and linen table clothes,  napkins that made our dining experience feel so special.  Our waitress was friendly and made sure our every request was attended.  The food was prepared with love which guaranteed our return in the near future.  We highly recommend this authentic Italian eatery."}
{"text":"First off. I went here because I had a gift card to this resturant. They failed to tell me that they decided not to accept them \"today\" 
After that I got the worst service ever. Maybe because we were \"younger\" as In mid 20's. I was never rude and I still tipped.  But the service was so poor it didn't matter how good the food was. Not that it took 2 hours to get 2 pasta dishes. 
I will never come back nor will I recommend it."}
{"text":"I get the \"La Salsa de Bona Pasta\" with cheese tortellini; it is always excellent. The service is excellent! I love to bring my family from out of town to try our authentic Italian place."}
{"text":"Just left La Bona for the first time and couldn't be more pleased. We we went because my wife was craving creme brûlée, but will be back for so much more. We started off with the tastiest bread shaped just like a heart. I earned romantic brownie points without even trying. After that we split a pasta primavera. We both like our veg cooked well but rarely get it when we order. This was cooked exactly as requested. When the creme brûlée we came for showed up it was everything we hoped and the perfect end to an accidental romantic evening. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place was the worst. Soup tastes days and days old. The pasta had no flavor. I would have rather just gone to Olive Garden compared to this which is sad because I love local. The place was hot and dirty. The waiter was rude and hard to understand and the bread was hot but must have been old because as soon as it cooled down even a little it was too dry to physically eat. Not worth it!!!"}
{"text":"So amazing! The sauce, pasta, bread and everything is so delicious!"}
{"text":"I had wildly high expectations for this place and was very excited to try it.  I choose this restaurant for our Valentines Day dinner due to the rave reviews that I have seen and a gift certificate I had.  I made a reservation knowing that it was Valentines Day.  When we arrived, it was understandably busy, but knowing this was going to be such a busy day, the restaurant was terribly unprepared for the event.  There was a hostess (her first day on the job), one cook and two servers.  That's all.  Once we got seated, it was a long wait until we were approached by our server.  We were given terrible bread; it looked and tasted like toasted wonder bread and a Pillsbury biscuit.  My wife enjoyed her soup, but it was cold.  My salad was wilted and pitiful.  After an additional endless wait, our food came.  I had the spaghetti which was excellent.  My wife's pasta was dry so she asked for a side of sauce.  The time it took to get a side of sauce was absurd and my entire meal was eaten before she was able to take a bit of hers.  The final straw for me was that they would not take a gift certificate as part of the payment because it was Valentines Day.  They had a rudimentary, sharpie written note on the hostess stand stating they would not take coupons, but it said nothing about a gift certificate.  The reason why I chose to go to this restaurant for Valentines Day was because I had a gift certificate and they would not honor it.  The only positive experience for me was my spaghetti dish was very good; otherwise, it was overpriced, lackluster service, excruciatingly long wait time (even for Valentines Day), and a silly policy regarding a gift certificate that made no sense.  Despite still having this gift certificate, I will not go back to this restaurant which is unfortunate because I am an avidly enthusiastic fan of good Italian food."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been driving by this restaurant for months now and when we drive by we always see people in there and we have been saying to each other, we need to try that place.  Well today we did,  we really wanted to like it, even talked about maybe having dinner there for Valentine's Day.  We ordered brushetta for an appetizer, the order came to the table on 2 separate plates for each of us on a large piece of bread, the same bread they use as garlic bread, but the odd thing is the tomatoes were hot.  I have never had hot brushetta.  Husband ordered the ceasar salad and I got the chicken piccatta and minestrone soup.  The soup was bland and consisted of carrots, celery and a few chunks of zucchini.  The chicken piccatta had no flavorm the chicken was over cooked and the piccatta  sauce was weirdly thick. The meal came with sauteed veggies and pasta with marinara sauce.  The pasta was over cooked and I have had better sauce out of a jar.  So disappointed because there are not many good Italian restaurants out here and being from Chicago I know a good Italian restaurant when I eat at one.  When we finished we talked about where else we will spend our money for our Valentine's Day dinner.  ."}
{"text":"We've been to this small, local gem multiple times and it never fails to please.  This is a great place to enjoy a leisurely-paced meal, allowing time to visit.  Walk in and be greeted by the smell of bread baking.  Sit down and prepare to enjoy a generous, complimentary basket of assorted breads and rolls.  Each order comes with a choice of soup or salad.  At tonight's visit, one person in our party had minestrone and one person ordered the clam chowder.  The clam chowder was described as \"good enough to be dessert.\"  The minestrone also received a thumbs up.  The green salad was good, but not exceptional.  Greens were fresh and the dressing didn't overwhelm.

Our entrees ran the gamut from spaghetti Bolognese with meatballs to dill salmon to eggplant parmesan.  Portions were generous and all entrees received praise.  The salmon featured a light, delicate dill sauce with a side of grilled vegetables.  The eggplant parmesan came with bowtie pasta featuring a marinara/alfredo sauce.  The Bolognese featured a wonderfully spiced sauce and three generously-sized meatballs.

We will definitely be returning to this local jewel in the future and we would urge others to do the same.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A good italian cafe style type of restaurant here. Very good Marinara sauce and meat sauce for the pasta. The pasta itself is very well done and seems cooked to order too. Salad was okay, adequate, but the house Italian dressing didn't seem to be the home made scratch dressing that was represented. Seemed more like bottled dressing. Had a nice assortment of desserts too. 

Better Italian restaurant choices here on the West Side but nice..."}
{"text":"The best Italian I've had in a very long time. I choose to eat/support locally owned restaurants and this is a perfect choice. Their food is fresh, staff is prompt and pleasant. The food is very well prepared, fresh ingredients and well thought out pairings. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Worth going for the bread and soup alone. A real veal cutlet a plus. Even the Lambrosco was lovely. Would go again when in town."}
{"text":"Just visited La Bona Pasta for the first time and really enjoyed it.  We live nearby and have been driving by without trying it for a long time.  We decided we wanted something different for dinner and found a coupon so we figured what the heck.

The restaurant is located in a strip mall and the dining room is very small.  The kitchen is open so you can watch them prepping and cooking while you wait.  This makes the atmosphere very cozy and I think adds to the experience.

The staff was very attentive and friendly and the food was fresh and tasted home made.  Definitely no microwaves here.

We're happy that we finally gave La Bona Pasta a try and will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night at 6 PM for dinner. It is a small place and about 75% of the tables were occupied. Like others said, we waited almost 30 montes just to get water. There is only one waiter for the whole place. We finally got drinks after 45 minutes. It took 2 hours to eat a simple dinner of spaghetti. The food was good but the service is horribly slow and the restaurant is ridiculously hot! Don't think we'll go back."}
{"text":"I always love eating here. staff is wonderful, and the food always tastes amazing. even when I order something as simple as spaghetti, the taste is always bold. best italian restaurant in this area by far."}
{"text":"Wanted to share a good dining experience in the west valley.  On Sunday afternoon, we met friends at La Bona Pasta on Indian School Rd. in Litchfield Park. http://labonapasta.net/index.html

 This locally owned restaurant is all about respect--for the food, the customer, and the dining experience.  The menu, while a little voluminous for the average diner, was right on target for the foodies amongst us.  Not only great Italian meat dishes, but how many kinds of pasta can you name?  You got it!  

The price is right too.  My dinner entrée, an abundant plate of spaghetti with white clam sauce came with soup or salad, baskets of beautiful freshly baked garlic bread and rolls and a plate of custom sliced butter (if you didn't want to use the fresh, flavored olive oil).  The cost was $11.95  

For starters, we ordered the baked brie served on crusty bread and topped with a rendered mushroom sauce. This was tasty and just right for the four of us.  For the first course, my husband chose the salad, an ample mix of fresh lettuces and vegetables, topped with finely julienned carrots.  I chose the soup, which was a delectable cream of asparagus with just the proper amount of seasoning.  

His entrée was one of three daily specials, Chicken Lasagna (others were Orange Roughy and braised pork chops).  The lasagna was plenty (even for my husband who was hungry) and it was delicious (I had bites).  In any Italian restaurant, I order spaghetti and white clam sauce and consider myself an expert on this dish.  It was prepared in the classic Italian way: lots of love, a few fresh, superbly cooked ingredients, frosted with fresh Parmesan, and cracked pepper--prefect.  I had to taste my friend's marinara sauce too.  It had the deep goodness of the garden with just a little kick of heat.  Wonderful.

The service was great!  I can say this with assurance, as I am an unembarrassed and habitual coffee drinker who does not like to hunt down a waiter.  (The restaurant also offers wine, by the bottle and glass).  The food was hot, well prepared and we lacked nothing. We had the best kind of service, never ignored but left in peace to savor our food.    

Because of the pleasure assured by a good meal and good company, a room that was agreeable and conducive to conversation, we lingered over coffee and ordered desert.  Lemon cake w/a yummy sauce, chocolate mousse cake with a dense bottom layer of pure heavenly chocolate, and another type of dark chocolate cake with a raspberry sauce--one that I wasn't quick enough to get a forkful of.  I ordered traditional Italian custard, the top perfectly crusted and layered with fresh whipped cream.  

And did I mention that the coffee was good?  We will go again and if we lived in the west valley, we'd be regulars.  Bon Appetite"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!!!  Everything they make is absolutely delicious!  Their soups are too die for!  If you want great Italian in the West Valley you have to come here! The whole staff is so friendly and so attentive. Definitely two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Walking into this restaurant we were so excited. We were greeted by the Italian owner who popped out from the kitchen to say welcome. The restaurant smells amazing. We were seated quickly and excited to order as everything on the menu looks fantastic. Unfortunately after we ordered our experience went downhill dramatically. Even though the restaurant was virtually empty as you can tell from the posted pictures we were given virtually no service after being seated. For 30 minutes the only thing we had received was our water. Sadly we watched another party who was seated after us receive basket after basket of divine smelling warm fresh bread. Each time the waiter or waitress walked by our table with another basket of warm fresh bread we hoped it was meant for us. After being seated for 40 minutes and \"enjoying our water\" we asked our waiter if we could have bread. He muttered something that sounded like he would bring bread. We continue to wait another 10 minutes but nobody came to our table. Our salad and our soup also did not come. Neither did our entree. I am typically extremely supportive of small businesses in this community and it brings me and my family great pleasure to support family-owned businesses. In this case the service was so extraordinarily poor that my husband and I had no choice but to leave this restaurant. Sadly we can only sum up our almost hour long time at La Bona Pasta with \"NO BREAD FOR YOU!\" (And no soup salad or entree). I will say the water was Ice cold and we were offered 1 refill during our almost hour long visit."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place on the way to the performing art center at ECC.  Wonderful, old world feel.  Food terrific.  My Nonna would have loved it!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"my husband, son and i ate here last night as we are new to the area and i had bought their groupon.  we were looking forward to this place and had high hopes.

when you walk in you discover it's a former sandwich/cafe type restaurant that folded and this group moved in on the cheap...spent no money on tenant improvements to make this their own.  the only money spent was for common, uninteresting Italian decorator art that is hanging too high for anyone to absorb its ambience.  the tables are the nicest objects in the place as they're very handsomely set.  with the abandoned shell of a location topped too heavily off with the fine-dining table settings, i felt it was poorly presented and imbalanced.  one should not have to see the cash register at any establishment outside of a Denny's.

service is painfully slow, made worse by a complete lack of enthusiasm and sense of welcoming.  empty plates stayed on the table way too long and, when the bill was presented, it was only after the waitress took three trips to clear the plates completely from the table.  it was painful to sit and watch the exercise in under-trained table service.

our three dishes, when arrived, seemed of good quality, but unattractively presented.  i ordered the champainge scampi with creme sauce.  when placed infront of me i could only see what appeared to be an opened can of Campbell's cream of muchroom soup drowning some unrecognizable lumpy items.  one could see no color of sauted shrimp (which had been butterflied and left tails on) nor confirm there were any in there without poking it around with the fork.  the veggies were alright, nothing to jump sky-high over, but i think the most disapointing was the bowtie pasta that was eons from el dente....when stabbed with my fork, disintergrated.

my husband and son enjoyed the flavors, for the most part, of their entrees...but could have been so hungry at that point they didn't consume for flavor priorities.

i found it odd as well that for a kitchen so exposed to the dining room it was very, very quite.  i felt like no actual cooking was happening as there was hardly a clank or clatter or sense of activity.  and if your wait staff cannot bring items for your table in a more timely fashion, at least they can spend some time lighting the candles on the tables as the added light was desparately needed.  lastly...do not let them seat you next to the gigantic and exposed restroom doors."}
{"text":"This Italian Mom. & Pop restaurant has become our \"go-to\" restaurant for that special WOW meal.  Part of me wants to be silent and keep this gem for ourselves and part of me wants everyone on the West side of the Valley to know about this place.  Every entree is cooked to order by the chef and the \"kitchen\" is visible to the diners.  Why would anyone go to any if those cardboard Italian places when La Buona Pasta is nearby.  Fresh HOT bread is delicious and the clam chowder is startlingly good.  The risotto entree will make you swoon and the pasta with sausage featured fresh Roma tomatoes and fresh basil.  Do yourself and your mouth a favor!  You'll be back, I promise!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, pasta, sauce and meats were excellent the bread was so-so. They do have a liquor licence now and the staff was very friendly.

Why two stars? probably the slowest service I have gotten in years and the temperature was way too hot! It took two hours fifteen minutes to complete dinner. It was about 30 minutes before we even got water! They place wasn't packed just slow. What the problem is, is that the kitchen is very small and there is just one chef. What they need to do is take reservations and sit only one table of four every half hour, or expand the kitchen/staff. They also need to find a better bread supplier and turn the AC down a few degrees."}
{"text":"LOVE the food!!!  Only place we will go for Italian food!  Way better than Olive Garden!  Only thing I would change would be lighting and ambiance."}
{"text":"Not sure how people are rating this less than 4 stars. Bread is phenomenal. The italian dressing is excellent. Every entree we have ordered was wonderful. Plus you support local hometown business."}
{"text":"Had the spaghetti bolognese and my wife had the genova pesto.  Both were excellent, the salad and dressing were also fantastic.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful and the staff was extremely friendly. The food was amazing and the prices were about the same as any other Italian place. For those of you saying the service is slow maybe you should slow down. We enjoyed the fact we were able to go in and not feel like we were bring rushed out the door so they could put the next set of butts at our table. We choose to share a meal and the waitress and kitchen put the meal on separate plates to serve us. Maybe slow but good service."}
{"text":"Very nice little Italian restaurant. I tried the Carbonara pasta and the mushroom ravioli on two separate occasions. Both were absolutely delicious. The cream of mushroom soup is also not to be missed. Their canollis are okay, but the tiramisu is also a winner. 

I will say the portions are huge, so maybe share a dish with someone. Service can also be a bit slow at peak times, but that's because there's only four people working there."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian meals we've ever had. The restaurant is not large and is located in a small mall. You might pass on it if you just saw their sign in the mall, but don't.

They were short staffed the night we went so the service was a bit slow however well worth the wait! We all had different meals and each were amazing."}
{"text":"How is this place. It packed every night? Other west valley restaurants have long waits, loud horrible ambience, rude wait staff, and mediocre over priced food (yes oreganos I'm talking about you). My daughter loved her birthday dinner tonight. Had the chicken piccata, wife had special chicken lasagna, daughter's had fettuccine. I had the minestrone soup which tasted amazing. All of it tasted incredibly fresh. The bread and butter...wonderful. Quiet and pleasant ambiance. Very polite wait staff from start to finish. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"A friend lives in Goodyear: I wanted to take her out for nice Italian dinner before she travels next week. Checking Yelp, I came upon La Bona Pasta's 4-star review. Judi has lived in area 9 years, and never heard of this restaurant (hidden in corner of a strip mall). I convinced her it was worth trying a new place! We went mid-week before July 4th holiday. It's summer, and traffic is light at sit-down restaurants this time of year. Walking in 6:30pm, we were warmly greeted, and chose a table next to window (albeit covered with attractive shades). Two other tables had diners. Our waiter, Jose, provided menus, took our drink order, and explained that everything on the menu is fresh, cooked to order, and homemade....including their wonderful bread! After reviewing choices on the menu, I selected their Dill Salmon entrée. Judi selected traditional Pollo Alfredo. Being a Seattle native, I'm familiar with the taste of fresh salmon, and theirs did not disappoint. Tender, moist, flavorful, prepared al-dente, it was a wonderful meal, with the dill sauce complimenting the fish! The accompanying hand-sliced vegetables (carrots, broccoli) were also al-dente, not overcooked. Same for the small portion of penne pasta pomodoro--just right. Judi was pleased with her chicken alfredo, and took a portion home. Service was attentive, but not fast, which was OK for our pace. We conversed over salad, bread and wine before our entrees arrived. It's worth allowing a few extra minutes for the quality preparation that goes into each meal at La Bona Pasta. We were very pleased overall, and vowed to return with friends again soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice and I have nothing but positive things to say about this place. The owners and staff are so friendly and make sure you're experience is a good one. The food is delicious. Way better than Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"Grab a drink, wait for the fresh baked bread, take your time and enjoy.  If you are looking to eat and run this is probably not your place.  I had the veal which was ok, but the sauce on the side pasta was incredible (I think his house Marinara with a bit of cream).  Salad was fresh and tasty and the Baked Bri app was great.  
Server told me if I thought the Marinara was good, I had to try the pesto, we'll be back at least to try that."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Italian Restaurant in the West Valley. Food is superb and the service was just as good. I need to come here more often."}
{"text":"Food here is so good. Their bread alone stands out from everyone out there it's so crispy and fluffy. Potato soup and chicken Alfredo is the best"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today and it was really good and very fresh. The service was great! Nice atmosphere too. The only reason I gave it was a 4 star rating is the strip mall location."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for lunch, first-timers! We are in LOVE with this restaurant! The fresh baked bread was so yummy. Our pastas were amazing! The pasta was so tender and the sauce tasted home made. Definitely coming back here again. And to top it off, the service was great and the decor was really cute! You can bring a date or just friends here."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after seeing all of the great reviews by others and they did not disappoint.  I got the novela ( house special chicken with pasta). It was light yet full of flavor and you could tell everything was prepared fresh.  From the basil, tomatos, chicken and pasta.
My wife got the chicken marsala and that was just as fresh and full of flavor.
My son had bruschetta and it was bright and original with the shallots shining through the standard tomato-olive oil combination.
Kudos to the chef and owner!!"}
{"text":"Have no idea how this place got 4 stars. We ate there and were revolted by the quality/freshness and the overall recipes. Does not taste like any Italian food I've had (and I grew up in NJ). I walked in and saw the chef manhandle the lettuce with bare hands. No gloves. I guess there's a reason why this place is ALWAYS empty (we ate there twice, and only because we had Groupons they couldn't be refunded). Both times we were the only ones eating there. I think the positive reviews are from people who don't know what quality Italian food is or are the relatives of the owners? Maybe they're comparing it to Olive Garden..."}
{"text":"I was craving Italian and  thought I'd try out some Italian food in Litchfield Park. This place is tucked away in the back corner of a shopping center. There was about 20 tables total for indoor seating and maybe 5 table outside. The kitchen was basically the center piece of the restaurant. On a Friday night I assumed it would be super slammed so I made a reservation just in case. We got there and there were maybe 4 tables filled. It was very quiet, which was nice. 

The service was slow but we honestly didn't mind at all. We took our time and enjoyed ourselves. We started with their complimentary bread basket that was very fresh and delicious then we ordered baked brie for our starter, which how can you go wrong with that? The we ordered two entrees, which included either soup or salad. The salad was average and the clam chowder was overly salty. The shrimp scampi with mushrooms, a side of veggies and pasta was great! Also, we tried the seafood napoli, which was also very good. Both entrees were very large and could easily be split between two people. If you wanna try this place out take your time and enjoy it:)"}
{"text":"Great experience, with very, very good food. It would hands down been 5 stars if I had more non-wheat food choices. Overall this restaurant brought us back to Europe unlike many that have tried. Why?
1. Service and attention to the customer was non-pushy and attentive when we wanted.
2. Salad was our choice all around (8 of us) and the order came to us fresh. Very fresh! 
3. Main course was very reminiscent of what I've ordered in Pisa or Cinque Terra. I had angel hair pasta with clams and other mussels. Yum! I'm wheat intolerant, but it was worth the sacrifice.
4. Prices were reasonable. $58 for four people and that included tip.
5. We were welcomed there heartily for over two hours!

We will be back ... Soon!"}
{"text":"One of our favorites in the West Valley.   Great rolls/bread, fresh pasta and good wine selection.   So nice to have a quiet atmosphere with linen and fresh flowers.
Love it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We've been here twice in the past month and both times top notch. La Bona Salsa with Spaghetti was delicious!! The Carbonara also delicious. Lasagna yummy! Cannoli fabulous! Highly recommend this place if you love Italian food!!"}
{"text":"The food was great....the Brie/roasted garlic appetizer was amazing.... and our main course was great...as was the service ... anxious to go back w Friday ends at some point ! No regrets I assure you!"}
{"text":"First time at La Bona Pasta, we were greeted right away and seated. The service was amazing very friendly waitress Isabelle. The food was amazing from the appetizers to the deserts. (highly recommend the clam chowder). The restaurant has a very tranquil and homely feel. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Discovered this place through Groupon, but will be back for the great food. It is a hidden gem. Highly recommend any of the chicken dishes. Loved the cream of spinach soup as well. Nice decore with extensive wine list. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I visited La Bona Pasta for some salads on a Sunday afternoon. The salads were delicious & attractively constructed. I enjoyed the my tomato flower on the Arizona Salad! Definitely worth visiting more often. :)"}
{"text":"Finally tried this little hole in the wall for lunch after driving by it for years. Staff extremely friendly and enthusiastic about the food. The baked Brie on toast was excellent and good enough to bring us back all by itself. My pasta carbonara was very good but lacking something, the Parmesan cheese did not have the nutty flavor I prefer for this dish. Wife had the pasta with Italian sausage which she really liked. After horking down the fresh rolls we were too full for desert. Next time we will save room. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was a very nice casual dinner experience.  The food was very good, I had the Shrimp Scampi.  Reasonable prices, nice facility and very attentive staff.  The menu had a wide variety of choices that make going back desirable.

Overall a very good experience and I will be going back."}
{"text":"The food and service here is amazing! Not traditional cookie cutter Italian food.  Chef Humberto is very creative with some of his authentic Italian dishes.  Sometimes he offers awesome special feature dishes, like the stuffed trout.  It's wonderful.  The tables have linen cloths and the service is great and not rushed. It's a relaxing environment, not meant to be rushed, but enjoyed. They even have an extra room to host events and special occasions.  I have eaten here several times.  I always try something different and I'm never dissapointed. The soups are always incredible. Shhhh, it's one of Litchfield Parks best kept secrets!"}
{"text":"It was okay, everything average, but prices a touch too high for just okay."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous family owners restaurant in Goodyear.  I am a foodie and it is very hard to find decent restaurants in the west valley.  I had a chicken dish the likes of which I have not tasted, even in my many trips to Italy and Sicily.  The sauce for the pasta is scrumptious.  We cannot wait to go back.  The prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"We walked into La Bona Pasta on a Saturday afternoon. We were the only people in there. I felt like the atmosphere was a little weird. The staff were awkward. I really wanted to leave but my boyfriend insisted that we stay. I was not blown away by the food. It wasn't bad but definitely not worth the price. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ok, so I went here months ago and have no memory of what I ate, though I do remember enjoying it. I think maybe I got something fish-related? Who knows. Oh well. I liked it.
I do remember the dinner atmosphere being nice and dim, and the restaurant was rather quiet the evening I went. It seemed like a great place for a pleasant and quiet meal."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant !!!! Great customer service pasta was good  I could say there's better places out there! It's not as traditional Italian should be!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. 5 tables with 1 of them being a party of 8+. Took 15 minutes for them to even stop by the table, 25 minutes for a salad and soup, another 20+ for the main course. The food was fine, but the service was god awful! The actual waitress walked by our table so many times but the hostess was the only one to help or stop. Poor girl didn't even know what capers were. I will never be returning. I'd rather drive 40 minutes to Scottsdale for Italian food."}
{"text":"Overpriced, bland food in a very small place. Maybe they could update it so it could be cozy or romantic...and season the food, ya, that'd be good."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, very very good! I had the spicy sausage marinara, it could have been spicier (but I like this a super spicy). Cappuccino was the best I've ever had, cream brûlée was delicious. Definitely try, prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"To be honest with you I haven't eaten there.  My wife and I went in for dinner on a Thursday night around 5:00pm and it had customers but not overly busy.  My wife is in a wheelchair, not a big electric one but just a custom sport model.  The guy seating us sat us at a very small table for 2 and my wife's chair would only fit over the very edge of the table.  There is no way she could have eaten like this.  We have had this issue in other places but the staff always gives us a bigger table for four.  I asked the gentleman seating us if we could have the larger table and he said that was a table for four and this was their busy time so we could not have it.
We are not one that goes around making a big deal about my wife being in a wheelchair and believe me she would have gladly gotten into a regular chair if she could.  I said then we will just leave and he mad e no effort to accomidate us.  I had read bad reviews about this place in the past because of their service and now I know why."}
{"text":"It was our second trip to the small corner restaurant in a small mall on a gift certificate.  We had lunch there and the food was plentiful and excellent.  You would be hard pressed to get a bigger lunch for the $8 lunch special.  One of the specials was the Spaghetti Bolognese with meat balls.  Lunch started with a bread basket and then your choice of soup or salad.  My wife had the salad which was well presented and several different types of greens.  I had the clam chowder and expected the requisit small bowl but got a regular soup bowl full of chowder!  Pleasant surprise!  The spaghetti arrived with a huge bowl of very flavorful spaghetti with meat sauce AND meat balls.  I was full after the bread basket and full bowl of soup but the spaghetti was so good, I finished it all and was really stuffed!  My wife had the penne pasta with sun dried tomatoes, pine nuts, basil, etc. Also a very large portion.  I would say that the serving of the food was a little slow compared to a chain restaurant but really, why not relax a little, talk to your companion, slow down and enjoy a nice unhurried meal."}
{"text":"West Valley people have zero taste buds. If I could give zero stars I would.  I grew up on Italian food and this is far from it. Salad was loaded with dry oregano. My veal parm was staight out of the freezer and freezer burned (must have been in there for weeks).  On top of that it was tough to even cut.  What good veal is tough!  Food 101 do not mix my vegetables with my Italian gravy if you wanna call it that (more like Chef Boyardee) Totally disappointed stay away, save your money.  It just blows my mind that all these restaurants in the West Valley get 4 stars!  It is painfully odvious that the people out west of Phoenix do not have a freakn clue what good food tastes like.  Smh. So damn frustrating!"}
{"text":"This place needs some help, I went in with two other people and it took 10 minutes for a waiter to ask about drinks. Now I can see this being okay and really busy restaurant but there was only one other couple there and they already had everything they needed. The food was subpar and bland. It took around 35 minutes to get our appetizer and around an hour to receive our meals. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Tonight we tried La Bona Pasta and we really enjoyed it!  They just opened (used to be the Daisy Cafe) so they are still getting into the swing of things, but if they can keep the amount of business they had tonight, business will be good!
I had the Carbonara and wife had the Pomodora and we both really did enjoy them.  We also had dessert Creme Brule' and Tiramisu and both are large enough to share, but both very good.  We will be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, and well worth the price. I loved the soup and homemade bread."}
{"text":"Well they screwed up our reservation to begin with. Then when we finally got to a table 25 minutes later we sat for 1/2 hour with NO service while folks who came later were served water, bread, wine and had their orders taken. We didn't even get a glass of water. So guess what? We walked out after another half hour of waiting and will NEVER go back. Too many good places around that want our business to be aggravated there."}
{"text":"The food is very good. I have never tried clam chowder soup before, but I am a huge clam chowder fan at La Bona Pasta. I have gone there 3 times. The service is slow so make sure that you go there when you have at least 2 hours for dinner. 

I know the food is homemade and I am fine to wait for good food, but the servers could be a little more attentive. It takes about 15 mintues just to get a glass a water once you sit down plus another 15 minutes for them to take your order and another 15 minutes for your bread and salad/soup. I should not have to keep trying to get the servers attention to get an initial glass of water when they are just standing at the counter.  

Waiting for a fresh homemade food is one thing, but to have to keep flagging down a server for water is another thing"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best Italian restaurant in the valley. 

Food come out just when it's supposed to. This is not a fast food place. They make everything fresh, if you're looking for a fresh place to eat this is it."}
{"text":"I truly cannot understand how so many people think this is the best Italian food ever. I guess some people need to get out more!!!! First, the best Italian food in Arizona is still not as good as the worst Italian food on the east coast. And second, I have had much better Italian food in Arizona that I have had here. 

The pros... 
-Service was excellent! 
-The garlic bread and rolls are delish. 
-The dinner salad was surprisingly good for a basic green dinner salad. 
-Prices are reasonable. 
-And the wine list was decent. 

The cons... 
-The bruschetta has tomatoes, capers, Gorgonzola cheese, egg whites, oil and no vinegar. Odd. It wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't order it again. 
-Despite its description on the menu, the chicken parm was covered in a very unappealing brownish-pink thick sauce, almost a gravy. It wasn't red marinara (that one would expect, especially since that is what it said on the menu) and it wasn't the pink sauce that covered the pasta. The server referred to it as a demi-glaze. It was especially disappointing because the chicken cutlet under that slop was good. It would have been great under simple red marinara and a nice melted slice of mozzarella. 
-The lasagna special was kind of a slop. Also not in a traditional marinara sauce (although not quite as bad as whatever was on the chicken parm). Definitely not enough lasagna noodles, which may be why it was more of a slop. And I don't know where the Italian sausage was that was supposed to be in it. 

I suppose there may be a good dish at La Bona Pasta, but I don't know if I will be back to find out."}
{"text":"Cute little romantic restaurant. Candle lit dinner with flowers. Their bread is delicious! Their food is amazing. It is a small little restaurant and always busy. Groupon always has deals for this restaurant so check it out"}
{"text":"We went to La Bona Pasta based on Yelp reviews. Well, either the chef had an off day or positive reviews are fake. The bread and salad were ok. The clam chowder was tasteless and contained perhaps one clam. Our main dishes took awhile to be served, even though there was only one other couple ordering before us. I had veal parm and it was covered with tasteless sauce. I'm not even sure it was veal. The veggies with it were tasteless. My wife had veal saltimbocca that was very bland. The service lacked enthusiasm. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! It's like an old school Italian restaurant in the corner of a strip mall. There was fresh baked bread on the table. A wide variety of food on the menu. Salads came with a house made Italian dressing and not some crap from a bottle. I had the pesto Genovese on gluten free pasta and it was delicious. My kids had meatballs and bolognese on gluten free pasta. They ate everything. My husband had the eggplant Parmesan which he really enjoyed. 

Then the waiter came out with a dessert platter to choose a desert. My husband ordered a cannoli which to his delight came with two large cannolis. I shared the creme brûlée with my kids which was excellent. We will definitely be back to this adorable little restaurant. It was a nice change of pace from all the chain restaurants around here."}
{"text":"Many times I had driven by this place just wondering! 
Well I finally stopped and was met at the door by Humberto who said they would be open at 4:00.Sure glad we waited the food is fantastic the presentation is amazing the service is second to none,this by far is now our favorite Italian restaurant !A wonderful family run business don't miss out on this  little treasure! !!

{"text":"The ambience was nice. Appropriate music playing softly in the background AND the food was great! Will dine here again!"}
{"text":"Came back here after ordering via Door Dash and had an amazing experience.  The food was exactly what I expected. Delicious. Hardy. Flavorful and great atmosphere. We came in for lunch after 1pm. The service is great. I love our waiter was so attentive and pleasant. He made sure we had what we needed before we asked. He's very soft spoken and polite. Our lunch was tasty and just what we needed. We'll be ordering from DoorDash again at home as well as coming by the restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love this place!  Everything is so fresh and full of flavor.  Just be sure you have plenty of time-everything is made to order so it can take some time- but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Italian. The garlic bread and rolls are yummy. Everything is freshly prepared. The cream sauce is the best I've ever had. Fresh flowers and cloth napkins, great service. Good for vegans. Over all delightful."}
{"text":"Cute little place.  You have to try the Sausage appetizer!!  Food was good, and they had a great selection.  The service was great.  Portions were nice, had some to take home for lunch.  It would be a great place for date night."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here (through a groupon) and definitely plan on returning.  I was hesitant at first due to some of the poor reviews but wanted to give it a chance.  Yes, the service is slower than let's say an Olive Garden, but then this is not a fast food restaurant.  Rather, each dish is prepared according to your specific order, not prepared in advance en masse.  Don't get me wrong, I frequent Olive Garden as well, but if you want a more relaxed environment with a personal flair then give it a shot.  If you are in a hurry then go elsewhere.  This establishment reminded me of a restaurant you would visit in Boston, or a Chicago neighborhood where they are family owned and operated.  It was refreshing and we really enjoyed ourselves.  The food was excellent as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant has very poor business practices. I looked online at there menu located on their website and placed an order to go. Gave my credit card and found out only when picking it up that the price had changed 4 more than what was posted on the website. I brought it their attention and they said sorry but would not adjust my credit card. I then pulled out their to go menu that was at the restaurant to find that the price was the same as the website. They took the to go menus and threw them in the trash but would still not adjust my credit card. I will never go to the restaurant again. They would not even talk to me or make it right after I pointed out their mistake in two different areas. Bad business and rude. Be careful"}
{"text":"Our water group went today for our monthly brunch.  There were 20 of us.  The food was fabulous according to everyone in the group!  We had wonderful service.  Thank you for taking such good care of us!
There are lunch specials and they are not skimpy.   There was garlic bread, garlic rolls."}
{"text":"It's been a while, but the first time my husband and I enjoyed the food, place is great and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"FYI......showed up for dinner. Sign on the door said, \"closed on Mondays till September 11th.\" 

Sad......."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! The ambience is like your in you're own home and your father is in the kitchen cooking your favorite dish. I cannot believe I've been living on this side for four years and I've never know of this cute little place. And the food my goodness gracious, last time I had this fabulous Italian food I was in Chicago. This is a must try place!!!!! We will be coming back for sure. Hats off to the chef, thank you!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food 
2 stars for service ( its very very very slow) 
3 stars for ambiance, they need to remodel a bit and update if they want to charge that price. 
The portion is fair. It's not huge like other places but it's good enough. They should change out the plate so it looks like more."}
{"text":"We have been driving by this place for a year and a half and finally decided to give it a try. We were very pleasantly surprised! It is now our favorite Italian Restaurant in the Avondale, Goodyear and Litchfield Park areas. We have been to all the usual chain restaurants in the area (Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill and Carrabba's) but found their overcooked pasta inedible. La Bona Pasta is a jewel in the West Valley! The bread was warm, fresh and tasty. The pasta was al dente and the sauces were excellent! My husband had the spaghetti with meat sauce, my daughter had Linguini Pomodoro and I had Linguini La Bona Pasta Special which was chicken and broccoli in a pink marinara sauce. We were all very happy with our choices! And even better, the portions are all so large that we all took home half of our portions. We have enough for another dinner! The service was superb. Our server was friendly and attentive. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was because the tiramisu was bland. It did not have enough coffee to give it that nice coffee flavor. Next time we will order the creme brûlée. All in all, if you are looking for a nice neighborhood restaurant, check this place out. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"My family dined here for the second time this week.  We were pleased with our experience.  Service was great, waters refilled often (a good thing after a day by the pool!).  We started with a baked Brie and it was different than any I've ever tried before.  It wasn't your typical puff pastry Brie but rather Brie on garlic bread, topped with balsamic marinated garlic slices.  Unique!  Tasty though and we enjoyed trying a new preparation.  A few in our party ordered a Caesar side salad and were disappointed. It's my 6 year old son's favorite thing to eat and he didn't like it.  My husband commented that it tasted watery and lacked flavor.  Unfortunate as it cost $2 more than just their standard dinner salad.  
Dinners were enjoyed by all except for my husband.  Nothing wrong with the dish, he just didn't love it.  It was listed as a customer favorite so he was disappointed.  Also they have some interesting combinations, such as their champagne scampi-not your typical scampi but a richer, creamier sauce.  Served on its own with a side of rigatoni with marinara.  We are used to scampi with a lemon garlic butter sauce over pasta.  Kind of a different way to serve things.
Bread is fantastic and plentiful.
All in all, another enjoyable meal at this quaint little trattoria."}
{"text":"This is probably the worse Italian restaurant
I have ever been to in my life. I wanted it to be good since it's right around the corner but we have been twice here at lunch and the empty tables should have been a sign. 
The bread is hard and seems reheated a few times before being served to us. The butter has a fridge smell and the main dishes are just lacking freshness creativity and taste. 
The lasagna is worse than a frozen pre-packaged box dinner one. The sauce is thick, has no moisture and is definitely from concentrate.
The novelo pasta is just a mess in a plate drouzed with what smells like rosemary and oil (probably the same that is displayed at the table). 
The clam soup is more a potatoes and frozen carrot soup with chicken broth mixed with some kind of half and half.
The waiter, although nice, has food spots all over his clothing which doesn't give the best impression. 
Overall, it's a bad experience. I didn't finish the food, packed it for the dog. I was too scared to get food poisoning. Nothing was fresh but everything did seem past expiration date.
Save your money try a different place."}
{"text":"Bellissimo 

I've  been to this small, local gem multiple times and I must say La Bona Pasta never fails to please.  La Bona Pasta is a great place to enjoy a leisurely-paced meal, allowing plenty of time for conversation and relaxation.  

As you walk into La Bona Pasta you can't help but notice the aroma of fresh bread baking.  You are greeted the moment you walk in and are seated promptly. Once seated you are given  a complimentary basket of assorted breads and rolls with soft butter, and the bread is absolutely delicious.

La Bona Pasta offers a variety of menu options, to satisfy just about anyone desire. Each entree comes with a choice of soup or salad.  At tonight's visit, we had the minestrone soup, which was enjoyed by all. Our entrees ran the gamut from Spaghetti Bolognese with meatballs, Lasanga, to Eggplant Parmesan.

The portions at La Bona Pasta are generous and all entrees received praise.  The eggplant parmesan came with bowtie pasta featuring a marinara/alfredo sauce.  The Bolognese featured a wonderfully spiced sauce and three generously-sized meatballs, and the lasanga was flavorful and delicious.

We will definitely be returning to this local faimly owned ans operated restraunt in the future and we would urge others to do the same.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch,  both of us had salads.  Both salads were excellent, the bread was delicious. Service was good, they weren't too busy though. We asked if they would use our pasta, we only use a low carb pasta. Chef said he will. Cant wait to come back. This is a little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Very very slow service and the food was only ok.

The bread that was served was warm but stale. For an appetizer we had the baked brie (I liked it but my husband didn't care for it), it wasn't on chiabatta bread as advertised but on thick slices if toast/bread. We then had the dill salmon with a side salad - the presentation is awful (it looked like a left over plate from home) the salmon with the sauce was pretty good but the pasta and veggies were only okay and an odd choice with the salmon; the side salad was a no go as well ..it had too much celery and oregano(?) in it.  We also had the spaghetti carbonara with mushrooms and peas with the soup on the side (instead of the side salad). The cream of mushroom soup was wonderful! But the carbonara not so much. It was alright - I wouldn't order it again. I had to box most of it because it is a big portion.

Now the layout of the restaurant is very odd to me, I.e. tables right in front of the restroom and the bar area is hiding the kitchen? I understand that it's a small space but it could be set up better. I also understand that there may only be 4 people working there but I don't believe that makes it okay to have customers wait 35-45 minutes for their meal and to not check on us or explain why we're waiting Because after we were done I paid my check and the waiter left for 10 minutes, I then found out to make change. We paid $49.50 plus tip = 1 appetizer, 2 meals, and 1 soda (no alcohol or anything).  I'm not sure if it was worth it to be honest."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Owners are always there making sure you are being taken care of."}
{"text":"WOW, you leave full and satisfied.  Food is great and always comes out piping hot. Best bread of any restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Ok so our first time attending this restaurant.   We are still trying to get to as many local places as we can.

When we got there, there was only us in the place.  Not sure what their lunch rush is like, but it was around 1130am.  The place is very nice. Small and clean.  Server was very friendly.  The bread and salad were really good.

I ordered the lasagna and my GF ordered the chicken Alfredo.  Overall the food was pretty good.  Lasagna had good flavor overall.  The Alfredo was also ok, nothing amazing but it did seem fresh.

Overall it was a good spot.  We may be returning."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Tried this little restaurant tonight on a whim and loved the food, service and decor.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time eating there today for lunch and it won't be our last. Service was great and the food was terrific. We had carbonara, meatballs with pink sauce, green salad, and cream of carrot soup. We're thinking about going again tomorrow."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for some time now. Went there yesterday 7/27/17 and had a great dining experience. So nice to sit down in a quaint comfortable atmosphere and actually dine as apposed to bar food or happy hour specials. The service was perfect, everything timed to enhance the experience and the food was just fantastic. Great portions, beautiful presentation paired with a fabulous wine and when the bill came I was shocked. I thought they forgot to add our appetizer or our wine or something because I've never experienced such quality and quantity at a reasonable price. Will be back very soon and looking forward to their monthly group dinners. One price 5-6 courses each paired with a different wine, I'll be a regular!"}
{"text":"Very good food here, loved my pasta and the desserts (tiramisu, and chic mousse cake) were both delicious. We will be back."}
{"text":"We came on a Monday night and finding a table was not a problem but the seating is limited so it may be more difficult on the wkends. The food was made fresh and served very hot! They have a large menu and portions! The service was also excellent, never had an empty glass of water."}
{"text":"This was a F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C place!!  The owner is chef and makes EVERYTHING by hand while you wait.  The sauces are so incredibly flavorful.  This is NOT your fast food New York pizza place--this is more like a rich Italian dining experience.  I had the Osso Buco which was so good I am definitely trying it again and my husband had this extraordinary pesto sauce tortellini.  I see other people had less favorable reviews, but I am thinking they must not be used to fine Italian dining.  If anyone has ever visited Pizza A Metro in Phoenix or Scottsdale--the food is VERY comparable.  I think this is really wonderful to not have to travel to far places to get a good quality meal.  The interiors look a little like a small scale Macaroni Grill and the kitchen is open so that patrons can watch the chef mastering your meal.  We had brief conversations with the family and they are genuinely interested in providing a high quality dining experience.    The only bad comment is that it is tucked away into the corner of a strip mall so if you don't look quick, you might just overlook it!  But if you do, flip around and go back!  It is worth the time.  BTW they brought out the dessert platter and have creme brulee, many varieties of cheesecake, spumoni and just about anything Italian.  We will be back! (very friendly environment too)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Wonderful food and service. This hole in the wall in a strip mall manages to make you feel warm and invited. The service is helpful and the food is always delicious. There is sometimes a wait, but be patient good things are worth it."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and just ok.  The service staff is a little akward but the service was good. It's not a special place you just can't wait to tell people about.  My kids didn't like the spaghetti sauce.  I wasn't crazy about it either.   I had the fish special and enjoyed it.  This restaurant is a little expensive but you do get a big serving."}
{"text":"1st time ever eating at a sit down restaurant by myself!  It's definitely delicious & totally memorable! I had the cream of mushroom soup...another 1st for me & it was so good!  I also had the Novela for lunch; it was lacking a bit of sauce for my liking but it was still good & I was happy to eat it; however, the waiter asked if I liked it or if I'd like a little more sauce & he brought me some on the side. It was like he read my mind!  Also, I can't forget to mention the amazing & complimentary fresh bread rolls & crusty garlic bread...so good! All in all this was a fabulous lunch! P.S. If you get the Novella ask for a side of marinara & some red pepper flakes...it  totally makes it!  P.P.S. Go for the cappuccino...it's delish!"}
{"text":"I can not stress how upset I am. It's my birthday, I called and they said it was empty, I should have known better! We got seated, no one was asked what we wanted to drink... after 10min we finally got waters, then upon insisting we wanted something else only 4 of the 10 got their drinks... 35min in still nothing, not asked for appetizers, not asked anything, there was 2 other tables equaling 7 other people and service was awful!!! We got up, paid for the 4 drinks and left!! Worst experience ever!!"}
{"text":"La Bona Pasta is in our opinion the best restaurant in the west valley.  The food is freshly prepared and always amazing.  We have eaten here many many times. Never have been disappointed in anything."}
{"text":"We've been to La Bona a couple of times now and each time it's been very good. It's a very mom and pop type but I view that as a good thing. The location is very clean and you can tell the staff takes pride in their product. The chowder is amazing and all of the pasta is delicious. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of 2 things. 1) it takes a little while to get your food because there is only one person truly cooking everyone's orders. However if you have time and a little patience, it's worth it. 2) We're a couple in our 30s and its definitely a place frequented by seniors. Again, totally fine but if you're looking for a neat place to kick off your date night or a night on the town, don't start here."}
{"text":"Attended a wedding rehearsal dinner here in the back party room. The great service is making this a 3 star rather than a 3 because the food was boring and bland. The pasta (mostaccioli /ravioli) tasted frozen and not made in house. The desserts we're pleasant. I was visiting from out of town and would've enjoyed local beers but they didn't have any. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"We were going to Taste of Italy, but upon arriving changed our mind. Decided to go to La Bona Pasta. We were there two years ago. (We're only in Goodyear/Phoenix for one week, every year.) Soooooo glad we came back! Dinner was Delish. Perfectly paced, not rushed. A wonderful dining evening. And my husband is still raving about the Cream of Asparagus soup! If you like Italian, you should definitely go! My Salciccia was the perfect balance of grilled Italian sausage with rigatoni ina spicy marinara. And my husband said his pasta bolognese was very good. There was no lack of flavor, nothing was bland, and everything seemed freshly prepared on the night we visited."}
{"text":"Busy restaurant. It has Very nice waitress/waiters. Therefore, customer service was good. I had dill salmon. It came with a side salad, penne noodles, and veggies. My husband had veal with soup, penne noodles and veggies. He lived his meal. We ended with a wonderful tiramisu dessert. Great place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here tonight. Started with the sausage appetizer which was delicious! My husband ordered the veal parmesan but wound up with a different veal dish, however it was really good. I had the champagne scampi which was very yummy. Excellent service. They never let our drinks get empty before refilling them. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"The service is less than stellar but this small family owned place has really good food.  The best cream of mushroom soup I have ever tasted.  The pasta sauces were all excellent too.  It does take a while but its worth it knowing everything is made from scratch by one chef.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had high expectations for this place, since it was rated well. It was a complete disappointment. I had the lasagna, which DID NOT taste fresh. My homemade tastes better. My husband had a chicken and pasta dish. The chicken tasted WEIRD and the pasta was very plain. It gave him stomach pains. Really sad; we were hoping to have found a yummy local Italian spot. It does, however, have a nice atmosphere and lovely staff."}
{"text":"Food is very good,  but the wait is far too long for a place like this,  especially on a less than 1/3 full Thursday night.  Took 90 minutes for two of us to get fed.  Fine dining,  ok, but not here.  Would consider take out,  maybe."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. Was hoping for authentic Italuan and they did not disappoint. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"2 hrs in and we have only received a small salad and some bread. Bread was pretty good but only eat here if you have the whole night to waste. And it gets worse. After all that time, mixed up orders and missing food and the food is coming out at different times so half our party had eaten and half don't have food yet. 2hrs and 20 minutes for all of us to get our food. It does taste good though."}
{"text":"Excellent food, relaxing atmosphere, great service. We will definitely return soon! Prices are reasonable and the selection is huge. One of the best restaurants we've eaten out in a year."}
{"text":"What a find.  Went there because of a online coupon but this place is a gem. Being seniors we of course went early, if you consider 5 oclock being early. So the service was prompt and so very friendly. We felt like we were friends that stopped by for dinner.  As for dinner it was delicious and portions were ample. We will definitely go back without a coupon it was that good. Do not pass up this gem of a restaurant if you like homemade Italian food.  I give it an A ++."}
{"text":"Worst Service that I have Ever Experience!
Arrived at 7:30pm and waited 20min to take our order and another 25 just to received our appetizers. Didn't get our soup or our main course. Yet, a local customer who knew the chef arrived with a huge party and were served their appetizers before ours. The staff decided to focus on their local customers and neglected to serve our family. VERY Disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner last night! All four of us had something different and all were wonderful. Only thing lacking were the martinis at the bar. Who serves martinis in a cocktail glass because you have run out of chilled glasses? Tell us that ahead of time so we can reconsider!  That needs improvement.
Will definitely be back but will stick with wine next time."}
{"text":"Nice spot with good atmosphere perfect for those who want to enjoy stimulating conversation for two hours before getting their entrees. The food was above average but the wait was unconscionable. Don't order the house Red.

It seemed like a good idea based on the reviews but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Came for an early dinner last week and it was our third time here. Each time I have ordered something different and have been so pleased with the taste of everything. I've had their meat ravioli with a delicious thick bolognese sauce and meatballs., their flavorful lasagna and chicken parmigiana. Their bread tastes homemade and comes out warm and quite tasty. The meal starts with bread and a very fresh salad. Goes right into the entree and I haven't left there without ordering dessert. The creme brûlée was fantastic. A generous portion and good vanilla flavor. My friend had the pistachio cake this time and I snuck a bite of that and it was pretty amazing too. 
The servers have always been attentive and very pleasant. 
I love these family owned gems on the west side. Give it a try and support our local merchants!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time tonight and it was delicious. Everything was fresh and tasted amazing! We got the special (fish stuffed with ricotta and a lemon cream sauce-sooo good), the wine list is decent and most of the deserts are made in-house! The prices are reasonable too. My only \"complaint\" would be the decor is a little antiquated for my taste, but I didn't go to look at the drapes- I went for the food!"}
{"text":"The pasta and chicken were amazing! I could not give it 5 stars because the salad was not good at all and almost turned me completely off, how do you mess up a salad. But I forgot about the salad after I bit into the awesome pasta!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy trying new restaurants especially non-chain ones.  We have been several times to La Bona Pasta and have had a great experience each time we've been.  The staff is friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"This is a very good and cute little Italian place on Indian School between Litchfield and Dysart. They bring bread to the table, which is very good. The pasta dishes we ordered were great and came with a soup and salad. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Vacationing with four generations. Happiness for all. Probably best flavors for all. Even the veggie medley was delicious. All flavors unique and staff friendly. Will come again next visit!"}
{"text":"I have had several dishes here but was blown away by the Orange Roufie I had the other night. Small quant place with great service. The risotto is another of my favorites."}
{"text":"Decided to head West rather then East for Valentine's Day with my good friend this year. This place had pretty good reviews, and trying new places is always fun, right? Wrong...We had made a reservation so we were seated pretty quickly, but that was the only quick thing about this place. It took our server about 10 minutes to even come by and get our drink order. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the Baked Brie, which wasn't exactly what we expected when it came out and it was drowning in balsamic vinegar. After ordering our entrees, we waited....and waited....and about an hour later, they finally arrived. I ordered the Tortellini Pesto which basically tasted like it had been microwaved, but I ate it nonetheless as I was starving. My friend ordered the Chicken Piccata, her usual go to dish. She described it as airplane chicken and couldn't even eat it. Luckily it came with some vegetables and a side of pasta which were edible. Obviously, we passed on dessert as it probably wouldn't have been anything to write home about based on our whole experience thus far.

2 hours later and we were finally walking out the door...unhappy, unsatisfied and thinking of which fast food joint we were going to stop by on the way home. There are so many better places to get a great Italian food in Phoenix. Don't go here!!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow, it took us almost 2 hours for four people to have dinner. My husband enjoyed the minestrone soup and my salad was fine. The bread was served bread and might have been the best thing of the night. I ordered the rigatoni and took one bite, it tasted just like chef boyarde. Luckily my husband is a saint and ate it for me and I ate his chicken and broccoli fetuccini alfredo which was actually pretty good. The food quality was certainly not worth the wait or price overall and it would be hard to come back here over other Italian options"}
{"text":"A very classy atmosphere, with fresh flowers, real candles and linens on the tables.  The food was so delicious, starting with the incredible aroma of garlic bread, the lip-smacking soups and freshly made pastas.  Our waitress, Isabel, was friendly and attentive, as were all the wait staff.  Everything was absolutely wonderful.  The restaurant is small, very clean and we were surprised to find it in the corner of a strip mall.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cute little hole in the wall.  Very quaint and the staff is super nice.  My husband got the salmon: it wasn't as fresh as he would like but still was tasty.  The minestrone soup was soooo fresh and so yummy.  The best I've ever had.  However the pasta was meh.  I definitely will be trying this place again.  I think maybe we didn't get the right dishes?  There were so many options to choose from and most could be made vegetarian (huge plus!).  Bottom line:  I will definitely be going back just because the staff was so nice and amenable.  Maybe next time I'll find my perfect dish!"}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to a great dinner. Sadly it wasn't the best experience for us...

The wait staff didn't seem to know the menu or what wines to pair with the dish. So we passed on the wine and were excited to have our main pasta dishes. 

The pasta dishes include a soup or salad and garlic bread with way too much dry parsley and salt. The potato soup was good and the salad was good as well. 

We ordered the La Bona Pasta dish and it had way too much pepper and both of the pasta dishes seemed to be abnormally hot, as if microwaved or something. The chicken in both dishes were over seasoned with rosemary (I can still taste it) and pepper. I actually couldn't eat the pasta dish and just ate the salad and bread. 

Seating time: 5 minutes
Food wait time: 35 minutes. (They forgot to put our order in)

Tips
Go for simple dishes, pasta and butter, salad, etc.
Stay away from the cheese, it doesn't melt and the texture is of sand.

Overall experience was meh."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Very drab ambiance and the food wasn't that great. Nothing to set it apart from any other Italian places. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"La Bona Ristorante is authentic, family owned and reminiscent of a restaurant you might find on a side street in Rome or Florence. We liked the ambiance; white linen table clothes albeit covered with heavy white paper that is changed fresh for every new diner. Also, cloth napkins, fresh flowers on the table, and candle lit. The heavy drapes may have an acoustical advantage for quiet dining that allows for conversation. The owner/chef greeted us as we walked in and we were shown to our table next to a window. We promptly received our ice water and red wine. They brought a basket of warm garlic bread and rolls with soft butter. They offered three specials but we opted to order off the menu. Soup or salad is included in the price of the entre. Their salad has high quality lettuce and ingredients and the Italian dressing is light with good flavor. I ordered the dill salmon which comes with fresh cut vegetables and pasta with marinara. I traded the included bow tie pasta for spaghetti. The salmon was perfectly prepared warm and moist. The dill sauce was very good but the quantity of sauce overwhelmed the salmon. I would order the salmon again but next time would request the dill sauce on the side. My wife ordered pasta Bolognese with an extra side of Italian sausage. She loved the pasta and took half of it home after eating her fill. Our pastas were served hot which is how it should be. Since everything is prepared fresh they are very accommodating to special requests but preparation does take time. We liked the leisurely pace of the service. We had time to enjoy our wine before being served the salad which was followed by our entre. We didn't order desert. In summary, we loved everything about La bono including their reasonable prices. We will be returning to this gem in Litchfield Park."}
{"text":"YUM YUM AND YUM! Great service. Great wine. Great food. Don't let the strip mall fool you!"}
{"text":"I came here only on busy holidays last year (Mother's Day, Valentine's Day but yesterday I came with a large group and for a just because dinner) I love it because it is a small family owned business and I'm all about supporting them. The food took a little longer than expected but again, it is expected for a group of 7 at a nice sit down restaurant. We all ordered different pastas and it was all very good. Our favorite was the carrot soup, you can't find that in many places. Of course, the desserts are must try!

My family comes from restaurant business and they all approved in this place. I will come back and I highly suggest it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to have Italian food for lunch today. 
We went to La Bona pasta upon a recent recommendation of a friend. We couldn't have been more happy we chose this wonderfully authentic Italian restaurant. 
The food was all freshly made and cooked to perfection.  Appititizzer was incredible Bruschetta!
I had Seafood Di Napoli it was phenomenal.  My wife had pasta with chicken capers and sun dried tomatoes  
Everything about this place was incredible. 
Humberto and Jesus made our lunch date an absolute pleasure. RUN TO La Bona Pasta it is PHENOMENALLY GREAT !!!!!"}
{"text":"We just got home from our second meal at La Bona Pasta.  I thought my first meal was excellent.  This one was even better.  I had the Pasta Novela.  The salad is a very nice mix of greens, tomatoes, carrots, and other fresh salad fixings.  The dressing is full of flavor.  My entree was chicken sautéed in olive oil garlic, basil, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, capers all mixed into my choice of pasta type.  It is then sprinkled with feta cheese.  The flavor was out of this world.  

I would definitely recommend La Bona Pasta to anyone."}
{"text":"You may have to wait a bit for your food. But the food makes it totally worth it. That's what keeps us coming back over and over. Love it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a dozen times.  I love the food, the variety of the menu is great, and the staff is friendly,  perfect mom n pop place with fair prices."}
{"text":"What a find.  Located in the corner of a strip mall, without GPS I never would have found this gem of a restaurant.  Everything is made from scratch, right there.  I wouldn't suggest it for the Olive Garden aficionados, as this is real deal, made when you order it, Italian deliciousness. The fresh baked breads, the soup with an amazing broth, then the main courses. My Saltimbocca alla Romana was so yummy, I truly savored each bite.  The delicate sauce was out of this world.  The service is warm but not suffocating.  You shouldn't be in a rush for your meal, every moment is worth it when your order is presented."}
{"text":"We ate at La Bona Pasta last Thursday for dinner and we can't wait to go back.  The food was very good... FRESH, the atmosphere was inviting and the service was excellent.   They have an extensive menu, so there is something for everyone.  We each had something different for dinner and we were all very pleased.  The prices were very reasonable and a salad was included with our meals.

We prefer to support family owned businesses.... We are tired of the chains with their mediocre food and service.  La Bona Pasta, you are a classy, casual operation!"}
{"text":"First time my wife and I had come here and we were amazed. The Brie was TRUELY amazing. Cream of mushroom soup was to die for and both of our main dishes were amazing. We are definitely come back."}
{"text":"Average flavor and over priced. I ordered the $14.00 Pollo Fettuccini Alfredo but said No Pollo, No Broccoli, I say since it's just sauce and noodles is it cheaper like most restaurants do. ABSOLUTELY NOT! Okay that's fine, whatever then I get the plate and it's the same size as my daughters meal which I ordered the exact same thing off of the kids menu / kids portion for $8.00... Guess what they were the same portion size!!! Only difference I got a cup of lentil soup I could have done without. Everything tasted sugary. My husband ordered spaghetti $13.00. No wonder we were the only table at 6:30pm"}
{"text":"Okay - i pass this place all the time when I take myself a different way home - let me tell you - I have a new Favorite Italian - My Father in Law didn't even know how good this was until today its small but I felt like I went to Mr Cs! Only missing murals & Christmas lights"}
{"text":"Today was our first time in this restaurant and we were very pleased. Food was delicious and service was great. I had the Minestrone Soup and Pollo La Bona Pasta, husband got the Clam Chowder Soup and Dill Salmon, all the food was great, made with fresh ingredients, you can taste all the different flavors. Our kids had the Pasta with Marinara sauce and it was delicious too, you can tell that every single dish had been made from scratch. We also tried two of their desserts, the Creme Brule and Pistachio Cake, yummy yummy. 

Yes the wait to get your food in the table it maybe longer than other places, but be patient is worth it, because the quality is reflected in every dish. If you don't think that it's worth the wait to get a great dish then you don't belong here and you will be more happy in a chained restaurant with \"fake\" food. 

Two thumbs up to this marvelous place, their food and their staff.  We'll be back pretty soon. Thank you very much. :)"}
{"text":"Their food was good and we enjoyed our dinners. I would suggest to them however, to be more successful, they should go lighter on the sauces they apply to the entrees (for example I had the dill salmon with wine sauce, and there was too much sauce. My boyfriend had chicken parmigiana which also had too much sauce covering it). 

A lighter, less excessive style would be perfect. The plates when they came out reminded me of an enchilada just by how it looked. 
They also need to lower their prices a little bit. Portions are good, but prices are still a little too high for the plates that they serve. It was clear for example that the chicken was frozen and then they heated it up, because it was a little too tough.

I agree with other reviewers who said the plates were too hot when they got to the table, but that didn't particularly bother me. 

The food came out pretty fast for us, I was pleasantly surprised. Overall it was pretty good food, but again they do need to lower the prices."}
{"text":"Second time here...we found it to be very good, again. Bread is very good, and a nice salad comes with each entree...something that is sadly missing from most restaurants these days. Feels good to support these family businesses. Apparently some folks think it's not as good as the east coast...news flash:  we're not living on the east coast. Be thankful for small favors."}
{"text":"7 people went with me. I didn't care for the celery in the salad or in the vegetables. Food was average at best!  2 couples purchased Groupon, $20 value for $13. The manager would only allow one even though we had 4 separate checks.  One of my favorite Italian meals is chicken marsala and I like to order it to compare restaurants. I would not order again at this restaurant if I ever go back which I probably will not."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service. After getting our table, it took the staff 15 mins just to ask for our drinks. 30mins later still getting ignored by the staff I got up paid for the Two drinks and we walked out."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and everything was wonderful. From the greeting to paying the bill. The food was AMAZING! There was only one server at the time and he was able to handle everything very well. 

We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"What a gem on the west side, especially when the Italian food options are limited to chains like Olive Garden or Carraba's.  No, it's not 5 star service, but if you take a moment and look around - the owner himself is literally waiting on every table.  Unfortunately, this is the price we pay for raising the minimum wage in AZ so small businesses like this one can survive.  Be patient, the food is worth it!!!  Everything we tried was very good, but the stand out dish was the risotto.  Each entree comes with salad or soup and we would go back just for the Caesar and minestrone!  Prices are reasonable and wine pours are heavy, so stop by for a relaxing dinner when you aren't in a rush (or call in for take out if you don't have the patience)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and convenient location (halfway between our friends' new house and ours).  Awful food.  Our friends just moved and after helping them rearrange furniture, we needed to find some food quickly.  Wanting to support this recently opened, non-chain restaurant, we agreed to try it (despite my Italian skepticism at any restaurant that misspells \"Buona\" in its name!)
Like Nicolas M, I too am Italian. I traveled across Italy and sampled the bounty of small town Italy, feasting at my cousin's home in Molise.  I appreciate great food, but also want to see the small business owner succeed and applaud anyone who has the chutzpah to open a restaurant in this still-crappy economy.
Our non-Italian friends were here before and said it was OK (I know, with that glowing endorsement, why didn't I steer them elsewhere?).  
We entered on a Saturday just before 6pm.  We were the ONLY patrons!  We've dined out several times with our friends and their 3yr old son.  This is the first time I've seen the boy so spooked at a restaurant.  Maybe he was having The Godfather flashbacks or just didn't know what to make of a restaurant with no other customer?!  This is a great kid who is normally well behaved in restaurants, but here, he was nervous and on the verge of tears for about 10 minutes! 
There was a man and a woman (possibly the owners) and then a chef.  After her first visit, my friend said she thought they were speaking Italian.  However, I quickly confirmed they were speaking Spanish (not that there's anything wrong w/that but I wouldn't be confident at a Chinese restaurant to hear the staff speaking Polish)!  I really really wanted to ask them what region they were from in Italy, but my husband made me keep Princess Snarkella locked up.
They brought a basket of mediocre garlic bread.  It was nicely garlicky, but had a fresh-from-the-Costco-freezer texture.  Sad to admit, but we ate it, so they brought us another basket, which was overcooked and not as garlicky as the first batch.  REALLY??  With only 1 table, is it that hard to achieve a little consistency with the bread?!?!?!
We perused the overly crowded and confusing menu.  Confusing because of the many spelling errors and typos, as well as the \"Feline\" or \"brown sauce\" mentioned by Nicolas M.  What the heck is \"Feline\" sauce?!?!?  I Googled to see if it was misspelled, trying such variations as Fellini or Felini but found nothing.  Needless to say, if you're going to misspell or misname a sauce, you MIGHT want to avoid any connotations that conjure up family pets.
Also strange was the way the man presented the daily specials.  He came to our table with 3 plates wrapped in plastic wrap, featuring the actual food items that they probably would have put flame to had we chosen one of the specials. Again, too many choices.  Is it really necessary to offer 3 daily specials at a small cafe?  They would be better off following in the steps of the fabulous Postino by choosing to focus on a few menu items while preserving the utmost quality, rather than a landslide of \"meh\" options.
My pasta Genova was probably the best at the table, a creamy pesto sauce with linguine.  The sauce had an OK flavor, but the pine nuts were like a rainbow....some very light, some a nicely toasted golden color, some a darker brown and a few overcooked to a deep chocolaty hue.  My husband ordered some creamy type sauce with peas and pancetta over penne.  It was flat.  Our friend's chicken with red sauce was abominable.  I think I would rather have Ragu!!  The only item I didn't try was my friend's husband's lasagna.
Although they have no liquor license yet, they do have a very reasonable $5.00 corkage fee, and had I realized this policy, I would have happily grabbed a bottle or two of Seghesio Zinfandel at the Safeway.
Dessert tray was impressive looking and our friends' son adored their chocolate cheesecake-type selection, but we were again meh about our creme brulee type dish.
Please La Buona Pasta, check your spellings (consult an Italian-English dictionary, pick up a Lidia Bastianich cookbook, hell, even visit a Macaroni Grill, at least they have proof-readers). And cut the menu options by at least 60%.  Find a few items you can perfect and stick with those.  Less is best.  Any good Italian knows the most delicious food consists of a few top-quality ingredients simply prepared with love
Buona Fortuna!."}
{"text":"I love restaurants that make you feel like you've watched a little too much of the Food Network...

The biggest benefit was the fact that there is a portion of your menu where you can choose one of their specialty sauces and pair it with your favorite pasta.  So I rooted through my memory of Alton Brown's 'Good Eats' shows trying to remember the uses of each type of pasta...and then remembered I'm not a pasta afficionado.

Prices are a tiny bit higher than say Olive Garden, but if given a choice between the two, I'd come back to La Bona Pasta.  Why?  Beccause they are 

F

The kitchen is wide open for you so it's not like they could drop a piece of chicken on the floor, or pick an orfice on their body and return to preparing your food.  They do everything right there!

Oh, and if one was worried about the fact that the prices are a couple of dollars more than a chain restaurant, one would only have to click on the following link: 

http://couponclipper.com/loc/LA-BONA-PASTA 

Which offers a 'buy one, get one half off' on lunch or dinner.  Fabulous!  I couldn't print it so I showed the coupon from my phone and they didn't hesitate to take it!  I would recommend printing it though, I think it might be easier for them.  It's good until next month but I'll bet they issue out another one when that one's done and you can be sure I'll use it!

Now Foodward!  My friend ordered the Carbonara with fettucini, and I got the Sauce a La Bona Pasta with angel hair.  We each tried the other's dish.  While the Carbonara was well executed (what could you possibly have a complaint about a lovely creamy sauce and PANCETTA??), we both agreed that we liked the signature sauce even better.  The Sauce a La Bona -or whatever it was called; who cares about the name it was Yummy!- included a creamy marinara sauce with bits of moist chicken, broccoli, and porcini mushrooms.  It was perfect with the angel hair but I could see it with fusili or farfalle as well.

We finished off the night with the tiramisu, which was definitely homemade and definitely one of the best I've had.  I didn't like the sauces they put on the plate...I know they did it for decor purposes, but I would have rather had a light dusting of cocoa on the plate, a little whipped cream, with a sprig of mint.  It would have complemented the cake much better.  

So to sum up this experience, I was more than happy about my meal and am extremely jealous I don't have a place like this closer to my house.  So La Bona Pasta, if Litchfield Park's rent is a little too much for you, we would be more than happy to have you move North!!"}
{"text":"Very very very slow service and unfortunately not worth the wait. We arrived at 6:30 pm on a Friday night and we didn't get our main entrees until 8:20 pm. We also witnessed a frustrated couple leave due to how long their food was taking. Other families nearby were also getting fed up. Not sure if this is usual here, but is was very annoying since we were never given an explanation. We should have known better when it took someone 15 minutes upon being seated to ask us what we'd like to drink. and another 10 minutes to receive them. We kept telling ourselves that maybe the food was all made from scratch and that it might be worth it to stick it out, but it all ended up being very lackluster. I got the clams in red sauce over linguine and it was very salty. My hubby got the seafood pasta and he also mentioned the saltiness. I didn't mention this to the waitress because #1. She never came around to ask us if everything was ok and #2. I wouldn't dare send it back and have to wait another almost 2 hours for something new. We never once received an apology as to how long everything was taking either. $100 dollars later we left tired and disappointed. Never will return. Ever."}
{"text":"I was seated at my table at 6:15pm. Initially I was acknowledged by the only waitress in the place. At 6:30 I ordered my food. It was veal parmegian, with penne and a side of sausage. At 7:00pm I asked the waitress where the soup was. Since it was the only soup they offered(minestrone), I did not understand why it took so long. At 7:15 my soup arrived. My entrée didn't arrive until 7:50pm. To my utter disbelief it was eggplant and bow tie pasta. I was so flipping dismayed that I did not want to say anything since it took so long to get my order. Mind you all during the waiting period the waitress never came up to me and others to apologize for the delay. From the time I did receive my soup until the time I finished the entrée she didn't ask me how was the food etc. I finally asked for the check. The only good thing about the restaurant was the food. The service was horrible and how can you screw up an order so bad? 
Finally I should note there were only 11 tables being served. of the eleven, nine had only two or less people. I was the only one by myself. Could it be that I received this poor service because I paid with a Groupon?"}
{"text":"A large group of friends and I had dinner here the other night and this was my first time dining here.  It is nice to have an Italian place so close to the house and no matter what you read here, I will be back to try something different...please read on.  

Since it was a party, there had been a preset menu with a choice of salad or Minestrone soup and 3 separate entree's.  The three entree's were Rotelle Pasta with Pork Sausages served in a bowl, Chicken Parmesan over a pasta and veggies or a Chicken Picatta.  I opted for the Minestrone Soup and the Chicken Picatta.  The soup was tasty but if I had to guess, it came from a can.  It was very Campbell's tasting. The Picatta was served with some delicious saute'd veggies which included halved Brussel Sprouts, Carrots and Leeks.  Pasta on the side with a basic marinara was also served, Farfalle, simple and good.  The chicken however was like a little hockey puck, rubbery and difficult to cut through.  A large disappointment for sure!  Thank goodness for the lemon and caper sauce as it was delicious and aided in getting me through it, although I did not finish it as it was far too much work. Chicken should be melt in your mouth tender, not shoe leather. 

The service was slow, mainly due to lack of experience I would have to guess.  They have 2 girls who barely speak English and were slow as if they were working in the Bahamian Islands where time matters to no one.  They meant well but were better suited as baby sitters or factory workers, certainly not servers.  

The dessert was most impressive!  We were shown a tray of 12 items which all looked wonderful!  Presentation was done right and all the items were amazingly top-notch.  The Creme' Brule' was large enough that 3 people could have shared it.  The cheese cake, chocolate mousse were also excellent but as I later found out came from a box at Restaurant Depot and not made in house.   

My understanding was the owner was also the chef.  When I walked up to the counter to buy some Cannoli to take home and he asked me personally how I felt about the restaurant.  I smiled and said it was nice, which it was, but certainly having room for much improvement.  Since this was a pre-set menu, I want to return and eat off of the regular menu as I understand its rather expansive by comparison.  Once that happens, I will re-do my review and see where he rates.  the Cannoli were hand piped in front of me and were definitely a hit at the house!  

Until then, try it out.  Everyone else I have spoken to has good things to say and good experience to pass along.  Sadly I cannot get on that bandwagon until a 2nd visit.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Best pasta in town in small cozy restaurant. Great music and atmosphere. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is in a sort of strip mall and we did not expect a lot, but we were wrong.  The service was great she made many good recommendations, one of them being the soups so I had the carrot soup.  I seriously want to go buy a couple gallons to eat and possibly bathe in, but seriously delicious.  We had a carbonara and lobster ravioli for dinner also delicious and their wine list has a nice selection.  I definitely recommend this place..... oh yeah and the tiramisu is delicious as well"}
{"text":"My Fiance and I dined here last night.  Just wanted to give our review for management as well as future diners.

Overall, we were pleased with our experience and will come back.

The Food:  Fiance had the Bona Pasta House sauce that was a delicious blend of Broccoli, Chicken, Mushrooms with a delicious Tomato based cream sauce, had a tiny bit of a spice that really made it pop.

I had the Carbonara sauce, being a big fan of pancetta.  Mine was not nearly as great as hers, mine actually a cream based sauce that was cooked too long, the sauce broke and seperated (those of you who have seen this know what I am talking about) I appreciate that they use fresh cream etc., but the sauce breaking was a deal breaker on this dish.  I brought it up to the waiter, who took it back and had it fixed, but I was already done eating and just had them pack it up to go.

The desserts were delicious, they gave us a Tirimisu on the house and we ordered a creme brulee.  The big issue we had here, was that they did not have a dessert menu, and that they just brought around a plate with one of all the desserts on it and then we chose one.  They never mentioned the price or anything of the dessert, and when we got the bill, our Creme Brulee was $9.75.  That is a bit high for a dessert, and especially one that they do not tell you the price of.

The server that was waiting on us was great, very gracious and knew the menu, it was a quiet night as we went on Labor Day evening.  We are big Italian food fans, this was a good change from the chain type places and we would go here again, but have a couple other Italian small places that we would go to before this, but the location in proximity to our home is good and so it may win out over those others on occasion."}
{"text":"Solid initial impression. The atmosphere is really cozy, and the restaurant seemed fairly packed with nice local crowd, very nice looking selection of wine. Small local restaurant, so expected service to be a little slower. Didn't even get water for nearly 20 min after sitting, after asking. Then folk who came in after were getting service first. Server came over, openly apologized and said \"regulars\" came in and needed to be taken care of. 50+ min after seated before getting good. Chicken Marsala,  overcooked/tough but sauce ok. Pasta, meatball good but sauce was boring. The bread variety was the best part of the meal. Just not worth the wait, nor was impression enough to go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - you can actually have a conversation.  Good food, good service.  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night. Not good at all. Bread hard, food flavorless, tap water. Crappy picnic tablecloth. Not worth the Groupon. My date was also very disappointed."}
{"text":"It's unfair to review this place poorly for the slow service. It seems to be a small family run restaurant consisting of 3 staff members (manager, waitress, chef). 

It's really lovely inside and has a very classy atmosphere. If you come at dusk you can sit by the window in candlelight and get a full view of the sunset. I took my fiance here on a date and it was very romantic. 

The food is exquisite. Certainly in the top tier of quality. In fact it's the finest food I have had in the area outside of the very expensive restaurants in Scottsdale.

I will agree that the service is on the slow side. But the staff are very friendly and it's worth the wait in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is the best kept secret in the west valley. Olive Garden?  Carrabas?   Fargetaboutit!  From the salad and bread to the entrees and desserts. Great great. Different slower service because it is literally a mom and pop restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been eating Italian food all my life and I have had both spectacular and awful.  I would consider this to be average.  Nothing that was bad but also nothing very notable.   And for the price, I have had a lot better.  Not worth the 45 min drive but if you live in the neighborhood probably OK once in a while.

We will just keep looking for the great spot that we know exists"}
