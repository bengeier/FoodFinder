{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in here a couple days ago to eat. No one greeted us at the door, we sat down and got some water as we looked over the menu. We immediately felt uncomfortable, the restaurant was empty except for one other booth. As we were looking over the menu we heard the waitress saying racist things about us to the people in the other booth in Spanish thinking that We couldn't understand her. We left immediately without ordering."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it's great everytime! The roll portions are huge and the fried rolls are delicious. They give you bottles of eel sauce and spicy mayo so you can decorate the rolls however you like.     The Las Vegas is my favorite, but it's hard to go wrong here. I recommend trying the tortilla soup, it comforting and has nice flavor. The Yakisoba is also a solid choice if you want some noodles.   Overall a great place if you want some good mex fusion sushi."}
{"text":"This place is not a sushi place!! People are Mexican here that know nothing about sushi they speak nothing but Spanish!! And they don't even have saki what kinda sushi place has no saki!! This place sucks"}
{"text":"One of our favorite sushi spots on the westside. Quick service and very generous portions!"}
{"text":"Oooohhh! I'm so full from a meal so delicious I couldn't stop eating it!  Then we ordered even more to take home. Please give this place a chance. Each meal is oversized, well made, creative and flavorful.  The Edamame is so addictively delicious even the large portion was not enough. We ended with 3 bowls.  The sushi is not your traditional fancy Japanese meal. No, it is a fabulous, well matched mix of Japanese & Mexican ingredients and artful plating. I can't say enough about the food! One member of our party doesn't like sea food, but was surprised & delighted by the Cordon Blue & Rollo Carne Asada rolls.  This place does a brisk to-go business. We were the only group eating in. The service was excellent! The food served quickly, hot & fresh. The pricing was budget friendly.  The waitress does not speak perfect English, but she is learning fast. The whole staff should be proud of their food!! Thanks Chef and staff for a memorable meal. We'll be back many more times. I hope you give this hidden jewel a chance."}
{"text":"Super on point sushi hybrid spot.  I love that you can get rolls with serranos and jalapenos in it.   So awesome.  The Miso is real strong too.  Usually you get mild miso, but I prefer it bold.  The staff is super friendly and all their recommendations have been on point.  Another plus is their price point.  Super affordable and HUGE portions.  I can get full off of a sushi roll and the miso."}
{"text":"Definitely not traditional sushi but the food and service were both out of this world. Quality of the food was great and its definitely an original take on sushi"}
{"text":"I think I just had the best Mexican fusion sushi I've ever experienced in my life. Don't judge this place by the fact that it is in the middle of a run down plaza in the hood. The menu was a mixture of Spanish and English. At first we were very skeptical and questioned what we just got ourselves into; however, after we got our sushi our opinion about this place changed. Basically, the sushi was epic!!! The rolls were better than the ones I've experienced at any fusion restaurant thus far. Be open minded and try this place out for yourselves!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! Ordered take out and did not get what I ordered. Pricey for the portions served and the quality of food. Plus the food was very bland. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Refer to Tina C's review for more detail. All I have to say is, it was really good and they could benefit in hiring a bilingual waitress."}
{"text":"Interesting and diverse menu. Not traditional sushi but very creative and tasty. The restaurant was spotlessly clean and the portions were very generous. Very good presentation. A good restaurant for this area."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place! Very economic and the rolls are huge! The people here treat you very nice and they're always on time."}
{"text":"Place is very clean and quiet. We ordered jalapeño poppers and they are amazing! They give you all the sauces you can imagine so that you don't have to keep asking for additional sauce. That's a huge plus! They were very helpful answering our questions about the menu items. Only bad thing was that we sat around for a long time waiting for our tab."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I purchased 3 Tierra or something like which consisted of a sushi roll with meat, chicken , and some type of sea creature. 2 bites in I regretted this roll.  No alcohol is sold so I couldn't drown this feeling. Then requested wasabi in hopes my nostrils would be in so much shock that I couldn't taste anything as I tried to swallow to my surprise our waitress didn't have a clue what I was asking eventually she replied with \"oh that little green thing\"  What she gave me was not wasabi tasted like play-doh. The prices are nothin special might as well go to a restaurant you'll spend the same as this little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Ate here last Saturday, ordered three sushi rolls and they were soooo freaking good!!! Order the edamame, they cook them in some kind of sauce that taste like beef tips...mmmm!!!! The guy who waited on us with the tattoo sleeves was super nice! Great service, great food! Can't wait until they serve beer!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was good but they had some trouble with the iPad when paying. Over all I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was VERY pleasantly suprised with this place. Nice spin with mexican/Latin flavors fusion with Japanese and they have nailed it! Portions are MASSIVE, I ordered 2 rolls at lunch and wasn't even able to finish 1! Highly recommend giving it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Yo agarre la extreme tostada is sabe a pura cebolla. As de cuenta que estás mordiendo una cebolla. Será el primer y ultima ves que voy."}
{"text":"Love their sushi. Wish they would add more surimi. Other than that it's great much more affordable than sushi sonora"}
{"text":"This place was a whole in the wall but served good sushi! I visited this place by Yelp reviews and I wasn't disappointed but the area wasn't the best area of town. The guy greeted us from start and very attentive. He brought it out and it was beautifully displayed which is a good impression! Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"Had some sushi roll from the menu of natural sushi types. Turned out to be a weird salad type of sushi. Taste was good if u like fish with Mexican canned salsas."}
{"text":"Hmm what can I say? I've tried other Mexican-Japanese fusion restaurants around Phoenix  and this place was \"meh\" in comparison. The sushi had a starchy taste and I wasn't happy with the sauces they placed on top of the sushi since those weren't specified on the menu (ex: not a big fan of spicy food so when I saw the sushi I ordered have sriracha on top, I was a little disappointed since it wasn't in the menu to warn me). Overall, Id probably pick Senor Sushi which is a few blocks away instead if I wanted fusion Mexican-Japanese. However, they also have a couple good points: staff was friendly and they give you squeeze bottles of eel sauce, their own version of soy sauce (which has a tangy twist), and some sort of chipotle mayo for your table in case you wanted a bit more flavor."}
{"text":"Was great, I was a little skeptical about eating Mexican sushi , but it was wonderful and tasty. If your looking for sushi but want to try something a little different."}
{"text":"I saw the review on this place and since it was close to home decided to try it out on Monday. This place is mix between Japanese and Mexican food. I order a Vegas roll and the bf order the fried rice. My sushi roll is basically just a rice roll. There was basically no fish or any other type of meat or veggies inside. Same thing goes for the fried rice. The pictures on here is deceiving. I don't think I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is not your ordinary sushi but it is a great restaurant putting a good twist on an old classic must try 10/10"}
{"text":"I have avoided Mexi-Sushi places in the past due to my snobbish sushi attitude. However, now that I have an amazing Latina in my life, she has opened my eyes to this interesting fusion.  We tried Extreme Sushi today and were pleasantly surprised at the food quality, vast portions and friendly service. It does help to speak Spanish so we had no trouble ordering.   We tried a baked roll, a deep fried roll and a \"natural\" roll (can't remember the name but it had pulpo inside) today. While the prices are a bit more than you'd pay at a standard Japanese Sushi establishment, the portion sizes here are HUGE. Even the ginger comes in a larger bowl than usual. Eel sauce and spicy mayo sauce also in abundance at the table side...and limes!! Yes it's delicious on sushi!  Of note -- most of the rolls have cream cheese inside. Apparently Mexi-sushi is known for the use of cream cheese so if you're not a cream cheese fan, you'll be hard pressed to find a roll on the menu w/out it.   All-in-all the experience was very good. My gf commented that it was close in quality and flavor to her favorite Mexi-Sushi place in Mexicali. There is a fresh seafood store right next door so I'm deducting that Extreme uses fresh seafood/fish."}
{"text":"first time coming here and it was super good. i usually get tired of eating sushi after like 3 bites but i loved the crunchy roll. super clean place too and they're not cheap with their condiments!"}
{"text":"Good sushi but a little over priced. Wasn't disappointed of the food quality but the reason for 4 stars are the prices. Wished they were a little cheaper. Overall, awesome spot! Won't disappoint."}
{"text":"1st  time at Extreme Sushi, was hesitant about Fusion restaurant Mexican-Japanese!!!! I was wrong, GREAT FOOD N BIG PORTIONS!!!  Coming back.....#hiddengem"}
{"text":"Incredible, surprising little hole in the wall strip mall shop... great sushi.  Didn't care for the wings much... but the sushi is tasty and unique, AND decently priced."}
{"text":"3 times I have returned , each and every time I leave satisfied! I am not a sushi eater but here I eat sushi! its that good. I love how everyone takes pride in the food the serve even the young teen who took our order. He did a fist pump when we said the food was awesome! He also recommended other dishes for the future which sound delicious but the Mango Sweet dish will always be my favorite!!"}
{"text":"The sushi were surprisingly good and quite large. The waitress did a good job. Very attentive and did her best. Plus she was very cute. If I lived closer definitely would go again."}
{"text":"I work in the area and was craving something different so I found Extreme Sushi on Yelp. First of all it was hard to find because it's in a little strip mall. So I do find it and walk in to literally find ZERO customers inside at lunch time which completely turns me off to the place. Because I'm already there I decided I'll try it. I received a menu from one of the 2 employees working and I see they only have speciality rolls nothing basic like a California roll. I can eat a decent amount of Sushi so I normally get two rolls so I decided to get two special rolls. The total was $27 plus bucks which I thought was very expensive for the fact I just wanted basic rolls. I get my food to go because of how awkward it is to be the only customer in the restaurant so I eat at my office and find out that these portions are huge. So I was upset that I bought 2 different rolls because I ended up only eating one order and the other went to waste. Would have been nice if the menu or employees gave me a heads up but they didn't really seem to give a crap. On top of everything the food wasn't very good. Not going back"}
{"text":"This place is not sushi! They don't even have true wasabi... The girl called it \"cosita verde\" Who works at a sushi place and doesn't know the name or what wasabi is? Also it tasted not even close to wasabi and I've had some cheap versions, this didn't compare.   I was very disappointed, the rolls were dry. Granted they had spicy mayo, saricha and other condiments in bottles to try to flavor your sushi. They did have this crab meat on your plate instead or ginger which was really good, I would say that was my favorite. I still missed the ginger.    Definitely not a true authentic sushi place, if you come bring wasabi with you."}
{"text":"Hubby brought this home for dinner one night. I can't even tell you what rolls we got...they were just good! Hahaha I especially liked that every roll came with a side of sarimi. I mixed in the spicy mayo sauce they give you with it and it made for a delicious little extra. We also got an order of fried rice...and it was like no fried rice I have ever had before...but in a good way. I'm not sure if they use a different grain of rice...or what...but I loved the texture of it. It had more of a chew to it than normal rice would...almost pasta like but it wasn't pasta. I don't know what they do but I really like it. Had a good \"fried\" flavor and not so soy saucy as some fried rices do. Part way through I decided to put some of their spicy mayo mixed in with it and loved that too. I guess I can eat that shit on everything! Lol. Get extra!"}
{"text":"I have my own go to sushi spot? but happened upon this place on the mere fact that I happened to be in the particular Phoenix area.   Now when I first got the menu I was unsure about the sushi / Mexican fusion they have going on but I still decided to give it a try.   I ordered the Arizona, Las Vegas, and Crunchy roll. Now I am used to my go to sushi spot and their 6-8 piece rolls, so when the waiter brought out the rolls, I instantly regretted ordering 3 rolls, even if it was two of us.   These rolls were not your average rolls, they were 12 piece monsters; you certainly get your money worth in the quantity department. Now quality wise I must say I was really impressed. The fusion of sushi and Mexican  is well done and My taste buds were in awe at the flavors I was greeted with.   I highly recommend you at least try it out, you may come out amazed."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mango Sweet, which according to the menu is brown rice, breaded chicken and mango salsa. What I received was an orange chicken type white rice bowl without a single trace of mango salsa. When I asked our server if the salsa was already in the bowl, he said yes, so I guess my definition of salsa must just be different from theirs. Despite that, the flavors were okay, enough to satisfy a super hungry stomach, but it's highly doubtful that I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"That's the oddest sushi I have ever eaten. California Roll that was drenched in some sort of salad dressing. Sort of a let down."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic Mexican Japanese fusion. I think from now on I'm going to try and put lemon and chili on any sushi. The people are really cool and friendly. Even if you don't speak Spanish they will get you what you need in a very pleasant way. They won't make you feel like an outsider. I've been here maybe a dozen times."}
{"text":"Not your typical sushi joint and in a hole in the wall location but the food is good and unique.   Friendly server and its all about the rolls.  Thats basically all they do.  A somewhat limited menu variety wise.  But the taste and quality more than make up for it.  One roll is very filling, making it a rather affordable lunch or dinner.   Nice decor.  I could have lived without telemundo blasting in my ear, but oh well."}
{"text":"Super awesome!!!! We went there last night for late night dinner and tits so great! Manuel, are server is super nice and awesome! The sushi's might be on the spicy side but I'm sure you can ask them if they can make it NOT spicy."}
{"text":"This is a MEXICAN FUSION sushi place. If you are looking for traditional sushi this is NOT the place. If you are looking for a less heathy but tasty twist this is the place. Do not be surprised if you are greeted in Spanish. I only have it three stars because my rice was hard, not enjoyable, so even though they just made it it was not like normal sushi rice. It had a very good taste just can't get past the hard rice."}
