{"text":"Way too expensive for what you get. I don't mind paying more for good food but this place was not worth it. Was recommended by a friend after telling her how much I loved Guu but I definitely can't listen to her anymore!   It's a nice looking place and the service was good as well, but the food comes first and it definitely was lacking. Sashimi was on par with AYCE places, not what you expect when you pay 40 bucks for 16 pieces.   Overall, not pleased with my food experience."}
{"text":"Amazing place downtown Oakville that makes you feel very welcome and has a downtown Toronto feel.  It's open a bit later than other places in Oakville therefore it's great for the night owl crowd. I've been there at least 3 times and there is usually some party going on.  Later in the evening they play music and have the most interesting Japanese Anime or Sumo wrestling on a big screen.   The food is authentic and high quality.  Their rolls are amazing.   But what makes this restaurant such a hit is the personal staff and bartenders who make everyone feel like a regular.  They greet everyone in Japanese.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My GF and I ate at Fin's on Saturday night Sept 21, 2013.  We had the chef's special tasting box which had 9 different items. The honey topped eggplant was quite good but everything else was mundane at best.  There were rubbery little pieces of octopus with much chopped vegetables in a sauce that overwhelmed everything. There was spicy salmon which was not spicy and was overwhelmed by a massive amount of mayo.  The tuna was tasteless. Etc. In addition, the decor is primitive and the place is incredibly loud for a supposedly upscale restaurant. It is simply not a good restaurant and I would not return."}
{"text":"warning. !!!!!!   This is not the same fin as before sold to new owner !   Super dry pull pork rice burger and stale sashimi salad and  gone bad chicken skewers were the 3 dishes ordered.    I gave 15% tip that the owner dared to ask for such food and service, smiled back at the owners and said \"see you next time\" NOT!"}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations. Ate early around 6.15 pm so was fairly quiet...2 others. Strangely asked if we had reservations...interesting!  Sauvignon Blanc from Chile was good and can be recommended. Cucumber Addiction tasty, avocado tempura very good, sashimi 3 kinds flawless, fresh raspberry point fresh oysters excellent value at $1.50 each. Shichimi duck salad also very good.  At $76 before HST & tip about right for the quality. Pleasant staff....will go again!"}
{"text":"What a gem! I'm so happy I wandered into FIn!   Since moving to Oakville I've been searching for as many Toronto-esque restaurants as possible so i can get my fill! I've found a few great places there, but no food (especially Asian) has actually been that great - until Fin!   I went here on a Sunday evening, and was concerned it wouldn't be open, but it was until 10 PM. We were greeted in Japanese and seated immediately by our extremely friendly and attentive server.   Food is a bit on the pricey side, but without there being much competition in terms of Izakaya in Oakville, I wasn't surprised, and it didn't break the bank.   Personal favorites were the selection of fish for three (see picture, so beautiful!) and the Eastern Style Caesar (who wouldn't love a drink with a crab leg in it!).  Overall i was super impressed with the quality and variety of food, as well as the service. I couldn't recommend Fin enough to those starved for a bit of Asian food in Oakville!  Disclaimer: If you're from Toronto and eat Izakaya all the time, this might be a touch pricey for you!"}
