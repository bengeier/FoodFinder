{"text":"We've been here twice since the grand opening in April 2017 and both visits were pleasant. The subs were very delicious at affordable prices. Great selections of subs; they even offer assorted subs with either satay beef or chicken (great combos). We also really enjoyed both the soya milk and corn drink. The owner told us that they are made in the store. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great Bahn Mi, lots of choices for both carnivores and vegetarians. 16 subs on the menu. Recently changed hands, but at least as good as before. Great prices too. Very friendly here. I do find the bubbles in the bubble tea are chalky so I order without bubbles."}
{"text":"Great Prices and a nice homestyle touch. Real hidden gem beside a laundromat.  Be sure to get a sub if it's your first time."}
