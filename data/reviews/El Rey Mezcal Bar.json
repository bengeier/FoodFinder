{"text":"Food was reallllyyyyyy saltyyyy!!! Had The ceviche, The Sandwich And The potatoe something.  For just food, I wouldn't come back. We were really expecting much better food. :("}
{"text":"I came here for cocktails on a Friday night. It was full but we were seated promptly. Very cute space - dimly lit - perfect for date night.   What I can't get over was the service. I can't remember the last time I was treated so well at a bar. We were promptly greeted upon arrival with a smile and conversation. The bartender was witty and eager to help us select the right cocktail for our tastes. All the staff were an absolute dream!"}
{"text":"Great service, tasty tostadas!  We had the bean and cheese and the vegetable one.  The vegetable tostadas was surprisingly good very fresh.  Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Ceviche here is is off the charts. Great selection of creative drinks... including the ones invented on the spot. Excellent selection of mezcal and tequilas. Need to try more of the food next time.."}
{"text":"We ordered quesadillas and they felt like instant made.  The drinks were overrated and definitely overpriced.  I had better expectations based on how popular they are."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a complete rip off!!!! It's wayyyy over priced for its location. Your view is absolutely horrid. Your view are decaying houses, and a 1960 abandoned housing complex. A margarita which was served in a rum glass cost me 13$!! My friends drinks was full of ice. And not to mention the tostadas. The tostada was tiny!!! I assumed I was going to get at least two for the price. It's soooo over priced for its location. It's located in the outskirts of Kensington market. I do not recommend this place at all!!! Not mexican whatsoever! I've been to Mexico, and I know what a margarita is and how's it's suppose to be served. This place is a complete rip off!!! It's just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 8.5/10 Food: 8.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 8.5/10  Looking at photos, you would think that El Rey is a small joint with select bar seating and a few tables near the window behind the bar. My friend and I were ended up being seated in a little seating area, just to the left and up a couple of stairs as you enter. It is a physically transportive experience. You no longer are in Kensington or Toronto, but rather a wonderfully local Mexican joint. The lighting is dim (but not in an obnoxious way) and the decor authentic.   But to the food. We shared the hamburguresa and the empanadas. To top off the night, we each enjoyed a grilled octopus tostada. All in all, I would say what you will enjoy at El Rey is small but mighty. Dishes have been well thought out and each possess their own zest and flavour. An easy add to the list of ones to come back to.  THE BOTTOM LINE: A great little spot if you are looking for something fairly quick, not too fancy, but delicious."}
{"text":"This place has it going on. The bartenders are top shelf. The food unique, well presented. You'll learn more about mescal by reading the menu than spending five days in Mexico. Great find!"}
{"text":"Opened by the same folks behind Bar Raval, El Rey really really misses the mark in all things that make Bar Raval-or any bar in that case; successful.   I came here on Saturday night to a bustling El Rey.  Was very excited to try the food and drinks but I left so dissapointed and disatified.  First there was no hostess but 2 wait staff told us a table of two would probably be a 2 hour wait. We were invited to hang out at the bar area which was crowded, a young group of 4 women monopolized 7 stools and a hefty portion of the bar while we stood around (they should have not let this happen at least with the stools). Another staff asked us if we wanted to order and food or drinks we said we were waiting for a table for 2 and he said there was one available (what happened to the 2 hour wait?) While he was seating us there was another wait staff that was about to usher another couple to the same table (where is the organization/communication?).  Food: There are many items off the menu with MP (Market Price) including the quesadilla and Mexican sandwhich. I understand MP for seafood but for bar snacks? Really?. Not to mention the 3 staff we spoke to didn't even know the prices for the MP items.  We were told the quesadilla sold out. So we tried the sandwich and the beef open face quesadilla thingy (sorry forgot what they called it). Not impressed at all. The sandwich was halibut which was great but for $15 it should not be a sandwich on its own. You can probably bring your $15 and get a full meal with it not just a half sized sandwich or equal or better quality. The flavours were not exciting, some guacamole and red cabbage to dress it up was unimpressive. The beef thing was horrible.  It was steak pieces with what seemed to be an Italian marinara sauce and cheese on a tortilla.   Drinks: You know how it feels a when you order an iced tea from Starbucks and realize after 3 sips that you just waisted your money on ice? Well you will feel the same equal disappointment with El Reys cocktails. The cups are filled with crushed ice to the brim, two sips and your drink is done, you are left staring at a glass full of ice (literally!). I understand crushed ice for some types of cocktails like something more heavily liquor based but for a refreshing summery drink like the Mexploitation which is their version of a Mai Tai (iced tea based Cocktail) you'd expect to get a fair amount of drink.  I really am never THIS disatisfied with a restaurant. The staff was really friendly but so disorganized.  The food and drinks are crazy overpriced for the portions and quality. If I could get my money back I would in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Really great spot. Super atmosphere. Food is top shelf. Really nice hand pressed corn tortillas made to order. Nice to have a taco place that also is a lovely restaurant, somewhere to enjoy an evening. Drinks are also really great but the price tag is a bit hefty. Ran up our bill with only two drinks. Staff is really knowledgeable and care a great deal about the food."}
{"text":"A really cool Mexican spot in Kensington. I REALLY liked the chicken tostada I got as well as the chorizo fries. The guac was good, but not amazing and I wasn't the biggest fan of the empanadas."}
{"text":"The cocktail list is wonderful but the food is just okay. We got the ceviche, the quesadillas, and the wild mushroom empanadas.  The ceviche was wonderful but the quesdillas and empanadas were not really good. The server, however, was excellent and its a wonderful patio!"}
{"text":"This was hands down our favorite place to eat when we visited Toronto, and we ate out a lot! Super tasty small bites! Friendly staff, unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great service,ambiance and the small menu was delicious. Full of flavour. Great selection of cocktails!"}
{"text":"We came here in a large group, which can be tough, but the service was great! The food and drinks are also delicious. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my man and my oldest and dearest friend. We were all well lit up before we arrived and excited to have some Mezcal. But for $38 per person for three tastes (.75 of an oz.) we decided against it. I know and like mezcal, but I simply won't pay $15 a shot for it.  Food ranged from ok to fab. The peanuts and crickets were a little overpriced considering that peanuts are free at a lot of bars. The small amount of cricket protein didn't satisfy me as paid for snack. The crunchy things with Valentina's sauce were also not very satisfying and definitely not worth $6. Empanadas were some of the best I've had. Excellent pastry and delicious filling! Octopus and Skirt steak tostadas were both wonderful. Mushroom quesedilla was great, too. By far, the winner in the race? The Beef Heart Antihuchos. Delicious tender nuggets of beef heart in a skewer.  Service was fantastic. Friendly and on the ball. If we dropped a fork, it was immediately replaced. If the waiter overheard that we wanted hot sauce, he brought two. He was also great about describing everything the menu to us.  Overall I really enjoyed this place, but I felt that we spent almost $100 on just snacks. Most of which was very fun and delicious but not satisfying. And the price of the mezcal was a huge turn off.   I might come back if all I'm after is a snack, but if I'm going to go to a mezcal bar, I'd like to drink mezcal and not have 3 flights of .75 oz. It's a steep price for a liquor that people are still discovering. I'm also not cheap. I believe you get what you pay for. But if three of us had the mescal tasting, our bill would have started at $125 after tax and tip. That's a little pricy.  Although I think the value could be better, it was a fun night and we definitely enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Visited last night (Thursday). The patio is cute, nice romantic chill ambiance. It was the main reason we decided to try it out.  The food was a complete disappointment. We ordered the frites which are basically hard chips with a spicy sauce on top (yuck!). The tomato dish was okay but overpriced - 5 slices of tomato with some seasoning for $12?? Finally the veggie quesadillas had barely any cheese inside and the tortilla tasted awful and plasticky. Also $5 for a piece!!  Drinks were okay, nothing special though. Needless to say, not coming back."}
{"text":"Chapeau to Grant van Gameren. Another wildly successful restaurant, and this time, it's in Kensington Market (one of the best neighbourhoods in the city!).  It's a great cocktail bar with a small menu of yummy share-zies, like ceviche, quesadillas, tostadas and cured meats. The Mexican steak sandwich is also mind-blowing! Thanks to its spacious outdoor patio, it quickly became one of my most favourite summer spots. I loved sitting outside watching all the bohemian hipsters walk past, getting the occasional whiff of mary jane, while sipping on a refreshing mezcal cocktail. This winter I intend to hibernate in the beautiful interior. The colours, the lighting and the art will take me away to Mexico and will warm my soul.  Doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"Nice spot for a lively catchup with friends and tasty nibbles. Nice patio feels. As much as everyone loves the owners' other spots, Bar Isabel and Bar Raval, El Rey was more my speed this past summer.  A relaxed, but still buzzy atmosphere to suit the Kensington vibe."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim on a cold Monday night for a drink and a bite. It was pretty quiet in the place, we were the only people in the bar area. We decided to try the special cocktail because it was mainly bourbon and lemon (marmalade, something they make themselves) and some other things. We tend to go for beer because Canadian cocktails are so high-priced for so little booze, but we liked the description. It was a really tasty drink.  Onto the food. We had the anticuchos, which is beef heart, with chimmichurri. It was delicious. There are usual 3 skewers per order, but our server suggested we add another one onto the other for easier sharing. An excellent suggestion. We also got the bean quesadilla. There were two different kinds on the plate, one blue corn and one yellow corn (it was dark). These were simple and delicious. Tasted really fresh. Tortillas were a bit on the rustic side, so a bit grainier in texture than some, but they held together. (And stale tortillas are the worst, so I appreciate the effort here.) We ate these with some squirts of the two house salsas, which were both hot and delicious.  While these were not inexpensive bites, they also didn't break the bank. Most importantly, they delivered a huge flavour bang for the buck. The service was friendly, casual, thoughtful and skilled. I would definitely come back. Looking forward to sitting on their patio come summer."}
{"text":"Super tasty mezcal drinks. stopped in on a friday night and the dj was spinning some groovy beats. The bartender was super friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend the empanadas."}
{"text":"Decent food -- like snacks though, at least for me. Are tostadas bite-sized? Maybe I'm just a big eater. But tasty tasty tasty!  Good atmosphere and friendly staff. They're willing to banter with you and make custom drinks if you'd like.   That being said... expensive drinks. Everything is kinda expensive in Kensington though. They're decent tasting drinks but I'd rather go to a proper cocktail bar instead of a Mexican place for that price. The patio looks cool though, I wish I had tried that out.   Also they had this freaky mirror thing going on on the walls or ceiling? I forgot but it was pretty rad when I first noticed it.   Overall, not bad for what it is."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance - there's a lot of detail in the interior. However, it's pricey. Especially for Kensington, in my opinion.  Considering that this place was opened by the same owners as Bar Raval, which is one of my all time favourites, I'm fairly disappointed.   We came on a Tuesday night around 9pm. Only one guy was serving - it didn't take long for the orders but he didn't seem to really want to be there, which is fair if you're serving the joint solo. More or less: I was hungry and I felt bad for ordering food.   It was margarita night which meant $3 off, but it was still $10 for a margarita - didn't feel quite like a deal to me, but much expected from a place like this. The margarita wasn't special either - tasted like a frat party premix.   The food was okay but for its size and price, it's $$.   I tried all three tacos (beef brisket, pork and squid), I was only impressed by the pork. The guac and chips were okay - the chips are hella salty, so beware! I liked the touch of cranberries in the guac.  I wouldn't go again on a weekday night. From the other reviews, I feel like it might be better on a busy weekend... however, that sounds like a nightmare to me."}
{"text":"4.5 i friggin love this place.  such a lively and chill spot.  great place for a date has that bar pub vibe in a mini atmospheric setting.  its not trying too hard, its unique as well...someone origibal in concept.  the staff was extremely nice and helpful.  i wouls definately come back.  food was good too."}
{"text":"Came here for late night cocktails on a Saturday night in January. Brought friends visiting from out of country. While paying for the bill, my friend's coat (including his sunglasses and leather gloves) was lifted from the coat hook by another guest! We later watched the surveillance video from the robbery. The thief put the stolen coat on and then added his over top and left. When we called the owner the next day to report the theft, he could not have cared less about keeping us as customers or making things right for us despite our $1,500 loss at his establishment.  When you charge $135 for a bottle of wine, you may want to offer your guests a safe place to put their coats. Duh. On principle alone, I am boycotting El Rey and their sister spot, Bar Raval.   Watch your bags at this place. After all, it's still Kensington market."}
{"text":"Cute spot. Went here for an early brunch and sat on the patio. We waited about 20 mins for someone to come to us to ask if someone had helped us already. Anyways, I got a quick bite to eat -- the bean and cheese tostada -- which I really enjoyed. It was super tasty but extremely smallllll (so I'd say to get three if you're starving).   Overall it was a cute patio but I won't be coming back because of how limited the menu is."}
{"text":"Beware this place is expensive given its location in Kensington. Cocktails $14 and not that great. Tortas and quesadillas seemed to be the most popular items on the menu and they are good! Come for a drink and light snack or your gonna feel like you got robbed and not by the neighbors across the street."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant inside of kensington market with a bigger patio outside. I went there at around 6pm on a Saturday and was able to get a seat inside in about 10 minutes. The interior feels very western with dark woods and knick knacks around, doesn't feel like you're in the city.   I just got a few snacks. Got the empanada, cripsy outside hot savory filling inside with a tangy a bit spicy dipping sauce on the side. The octopus tostada was beautiful to look at, bright green from the avocado with red chilis on top. But for $15 it was very small. The octopus itself was nicely grilled and taste good but it was a snack for the price of an entree.   With an extensive drink menu this is a great place to grab a snack and drinks but I wouldn't come hungry or else i'd have to spend a good amount to be full"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the knowledgeable bar manager gave us a few recommends of other bars to check out too. Tequila is one of my favorite things to drink and the selection covered everything from more herbal flavors to stronger peppery mezcals."}
{"text":"More accurately 3.5 stars. I found the service to be quite good. All the folks working here are kind and attentive. I had the potato sope. It was good, interesting combination of textures and flavors. I'd reccomend it. A very different mexican experience than what I'm used to. I also enjoyed the  samba Chula cocktail. Had a distinct tequila flavour which surprised me. I didn't find it match in flavors to the description. To me it was more of a glass full of crushed ice, which was nice...I just wondered where all the drink was!"}
{"text":"This is super high quality Mexican.  The best in town.  The Chicken Tinga and steak tostadas are delicious and unique.  They burst with flavor and have completely different taste combinations, the Tinga with a lovely smoked chipotle sour cream, the steak with a lovely green sikil pak pumpkin spread that accentuates the meat.  The corn tostada underneath is fresh and tasty.  The Anticuchos, Peruvian beef hearts are better than at Peruvian restaurants I have tried.  The carne apache is beef tartare on steroids with great acidity and texture.  If I have one complaint?  The price is high relative to the quantity, but not the quality of the food.  I've dropped $30 on much less tasty food, so its relative.  This place has high quality ingredients, and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"So much fun. Massive selection of mezcal, and the staff are very enthusiastic.  Beautiful wood interior with lots of gorgeous plants.  Absolutely worth your time."}
{"text":"El Rey is a fantastic addition to Kensington Market. There are followers, and there are innovators - Grant van Gameren is by far an innovator. With each new restaurant, he's expanded the horizons of the Toronto dining scene, giving us something completely new, challenging, unique and fun to explore. El Rey Mezcal Bar continues this trajectory, and it's pretty great. The space is just gorgeous, colorful and artistic with beautiful lighting everywhere. We visited on a rainy night, and I loved the ambiance inside, very intimate and romantic while still lighthearted and playful. When it's not thundering out, there's a massive patio out front, and they even expand the patio out into the street on Kensington's Pedestrian Sundays.  Mezcal has been hard to come by in Toronto, and if you haven't had it, it's wonderful stuff - kind of like tequila's smokey, complex cousin. No other bar in TO has the full education's worth of mezcal flights that El Rey has on offer. There is a very original, extensive cocktail list - I'm unfortunately not drinking currently, but everyone at our table loved their boozy, perfectly crafted cocktails, and I loved the non-alcoholic mocktails the bartender whipped up for me.   We also enjoyed the food, sampling the beef tlayuda, smoked chicken quesadillas, shisito peppers, potato sope - all excellent bar snacks, but I would definitely call this a bar with food, not a full restaurant. The service is definitely more bar than restaurant, and I'm sure that will be offputting to some. Judge as you will, but when there's 5 pages of booze on the menu and only 1 page of food, you are probably in a bar. And when a bar is this good, have a drink and enjoy! There is nothing to complain about here, it's all awesome."}
{"text":"It's pricey but mezcales aren't cheap! Limited food menu (didn't try). Nice vibe though."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times already, and each experience has been pretty good. Highlights would be the summer-ready patio and quick, attentive service. My favorite food items are the shishito peppers, ceviche, and anticucho skewers. The portions aren't massive, but all the more reason to order a bunch of dishes and share them with your posse. On the alcohol front, I can't say I'm a Mezcal convert just yet, but their \"What Is Mezcal\" introductory item comprising of three different types of Mezcals is definitely worth a try. I'm more of a fan of their cocktails, especially the smooth and breezy Open Windows.   Out of Grant van Gameren's three main posts, this one feels the most casual and perhaps the most modest in its ambitions, but the end result makes for no less of an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, amazing drinks, professional staff. However, portions are too small for the price."}
{"text":"This is Grant van Gameren's latest addition to the city's vibrant cocktail scene: a Mezcal bar right on the border of Kensington, close to Chinatown.  Got there around 1AM and the place was still very much alive with quite a few people from the industry checking the place. It still smells very much new but given the traffic that certainly won't be the case for long.  The place is very much focused on Mezcal. There are tons of it and the staff was very knowledgeable. Tried one smoky and chilly one which was pretty awesome and certainly changed my perception of the liquid. Had it with some spicy round chips that were just a good excuse to sample some more Mezcal. If you're not into this there are also other spirits and you will find great whiskies including some cool new Canadian whiskies like Gooderham & Worts and Lot 40.  The patio was also open and will certainly be a great destination in Kensington. The inside decor is very nice and stays authentic.  Will most definitely be back to check the food options."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at El Rey Mezcal Bar (they opened in May).  It's a cute spot.  They had a great rum selection (which I appreciated) and an interesting beer selection (which Gord appreciated).  Gord had the Anticuchos ... \"Peruvian meat skewers\" is beef heart (Gord is adventurous at times).  He said it was really good and he'd get it again.  I had the Skirt Steak Tostada.  It too was delicious.  It had a bit of a bite.  I'd get it again.  Nick was our server and he took good care of us.  He was very knowledgeable about the food and their rum.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent if you like tequilla, mezcal or cocktails in general.  This place is basically dangerous if that's what you like.   Compared Repesado on Ossington, the prices here are much better and the ambiance is much more relaxed."}
{"text":"Great patio and decent cocktails.  The food was weak at best and expensive for what it was.  All in all it was a fun spot to pop in, would not order the food and found it a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Toronto is a city blessed with great cocktails and El Rey is certainly one of the many great spots in the city. The setup and decor, as well as the bar selection is very much on point as with other Grant van Gameren joints. The lighting, atmosphere, and even the general clientele all make for a rather unique place to visit within Kensington. The prices are reasonable and the cocktails are pretty decent as well. My one big issue with this spot is the music volume, which makes it not only difficult to hear friends but to even order drinks at the bar. We mentioned it to the staff (who had difficulty hearing our orders and agreed about the noise) but nothing changed.   Overall, this is a great spot in Kensington for an inspired cocktail, but I personally prefer my cocktail bars quieter than King St. clubs."}
{"text":"Portion size is tiny, but tasty. Everything is over priced. Go for one drink only. Enjoyable atmosphere"}
{"text":"Fantastic bar with a huge Mezcal selection! The cocktails are to die for and the service is amazing! Make sure you sit atbthe bar brcause watching the bar tenders prepare the drinks is mesmerizing! We will be back to taste the food!"}
{"text":"Three of us went last night and had a really good time. I had just finished reading a book on tequila and mezcal, so was very interested in trying these impossible to get mezcals. It was fascinating and the bartender, Julian, was very knowledgeable. Yes, the mezcals are pricey, but it's worth it. And the torta I had was excellent."}
{"text":"Love the Open Windows cocktail! The mezcal gives the drink a bit of a smokey flavour; paired with the tartness of the lime, plus a tad bit of sweetness from the pineapple + spiciness from the chili - this drink packs a punch of flavour! Great for a summer day on the patio. The food is mostly simple bar snacks or small tapa-sized portions; the highlight is definitely the drinks."}
{"text":"Came here on a sunny day after work to get drinks on a patio. The patio was full, so we sat by the windows, which was still pleasant.  I ordered the La Niña Fresa (light & sweet) and my boyfriend had the Paloma (alcohol tasted pretty strong). We also ordered fries/chorizo to share, which was kind of a poutine. It had Tocino mayo, cheese, jalapeño peppers, bean sauce, and crumbled chorizo!   The atmosphere inside is really fun and it's in a good location."}
