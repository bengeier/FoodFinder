{"text":"Expensive drinks. Had up to 12 people in the back room during a band in the main room. No servers at all and always a table full of empty glasses and bottles. Never seen anything like it. Don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"I never really liked this place until I recently popped in for a quick drink with a friend. They redid the whole place it seemed. It was a Friday night and the place was packed for this Ragae band. It was a riot. Not to mention half the bar is filled with fun games like bar bowling, a virtual corn toss game, and a pretty nifty cool beer pong machine. Worth checking out"}
{"text":"Where do I begin with this hot mess?  I guess let's go with the obvious...the decor.  The best way to describe it is to ask you to picture someone buying knick knacks from a neighborhood wide garage sale and sticking the objects up on the walls and around the bar.  Old Brett Favre jerseys, lava lamps, movie posters, Christmas lights...it was just weird.  The drink prices were very reasonable...I'll give them that.  A pint of Yuengling was $2.75.    There was a band playing the night I was there.  I don't know if it was the bar's acoustics or the band's amps turned up to 11, but damn it was loud.  You had to shout and hope the person sitting next to you could read your lips!  I'm pretty sure you had to grow up in West Lake to fully appreciate this bar.  If you're an outsider, you may want to grab a beer elsewhere."}
{"text":"My kind of place.   Bartender saw my empty and refilled me without being ask.   80s decor.     What more can you ask for.  I'll be back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Do not let the name, flashy window lights, or the strip mall appearance fool you. I went to Time Warp for the first time and was shocked that the interior was super clean. There was a really cool band playing everything from  Donna Summers to Tom Petty. The girls at the bar were really nice.  Ups of TWB- great music, keno, and cheap drinks  Downs of TWB- only a handful of fried appetizers  Also the crowd here is 50s and up."}
{"text":"Professional and friendly staff and atmosphere.  I don't hang in bars to drink much anymore, but Time Warp is A OK."}
{"text":"Never been to this place but WAY better than almost anywhere I'd been in Cleveland.   Great staff, much nicer crowd than many bars and the band rocked big time.  \"Cleveland's Breakfast Club\".  Cool sound system and for those who didn't want their face blown off (we did) they could hang behind the band on the pool table side and still hear things.  Well done - now get the Browns to win and we are all good."}
{"text":"Great Westlake bar. Inexpensive. Small joint but packed with good beer, good music, great pro live band setup and friendly servers. Everything from coors light to awesome craft IPAs. Well done. Food from the great pizza joint next door can be ordered in the bar."}
{"text":"Met some friends from work for a Happy Hour here last week. The venue is wide open with plenty of space, some interesting decor (racy, vintage photos and posters), some TVs, and plenty of games. Although we sat at a table, there was no waitress to help us so we had to keep going to the bar to order beer and food. Can't beat $1 drafts and $2 pizza by the slice (although you get what you pay for - the pizza was very card-boardy). Lots of complimentary popcorn as well (sorry about the mess). So, this place is A-OK for an after work happy hour gathering, but I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable coming here just for the food/service."}
{"text":"Fun place for live cover bands on the west side. Servers are friendly if not always fast, but the live music will keep you occupied while you wait.  Have never heard a band here that was bad.  Not the hot new bar on the radar, but the charm is that it's not trying to be.  Highly recommended for the over 30 crowd who prove that tequila shots can make anyone sing Bon Jovi at the top of their lungs."}
{"text":"Was here last night. Was told it was a dive bar. Nope not to me. Very nice place. Well lit. Bright. Large bar with music venue and video games. Really great lady bartenders and great prices on all drinks. Will go here again"}
{"text":"I dragged my feet when my boyfriend dragged me to this bar to meet friends... but was pleasantly surprised! Don't let the outside appearance fool you, it's not a dive bar.  It's spacious and clean inside, with a great atmosphere... Fun, but relaxed. Plenty of games off to the right hand of the room, a stage to the left that some good local bands have played (which draw quite the crowd!), and TVs all around to catch the game with friends. They have a good drink list, particularly with various mules!  The bartenders are friendly, and the crowd isn't skeevy. Great local bar for a chill night out with friends.  Only cons: Limited food choices, although you can order from Sweet Basil's next door. And they got rid of the game NBA Jam - which was a focal point for our gatherings.  *** Update: Time Warp kindly let me know that they got rid of NBA Jam because it broke, but a replacement will be here this fall! Awesome! ***"}
{"text":"This place is completely deceiving. I was a little intimidated at first glance. Tinted windows, drink specials plastered on the exterior glass, a cheesy bar name. But what the hell. We were out here anyways waiting on a pizza at Sweet Basil and decided to wait out the completion of our order at this adjacent bar.   Inside, it's a complete time warp as the name appropriately suggests. '80's kitsch everywhere. Movie paraphernalia, framed gold records, lava lamps, mini-football helmets like every little boy collected in their youth and more. Seating includes plenty of high-tops, a bar with apx. 10+ stools and a few comfy couches.   The space is extremely clean and tidy. Not skeevy at all. My Mom would totally approve. It almost looked brand new. The bartender is very accommodating and told us about some of the weekly entertainment that included beer pong! She went on to say that if we ever order at Sweet Basil again, they would offer to call over there so they could let us know when our order was ready. How accommodating!   I can see this place being great for a reunion or a trivia night. If nothing more, the cheese factor alone would be plenty entertaining."}
{"text":"As someone who likes Sweet Basil's pizza but dislikes squawking children, this is a good place to hide out while downing a pie - you can get table service from the parlor next door. The beer is cheap, though the draft selections are paltry. If not for the pizza, I don't think this would be a frequent stop. The decor is like a sexagenarian's man cave, and the crowd reflects that. I'm sure it's cool to some people, but I'm not one of them."}
{"text":"Our Meetup group with 23 attendees returned to The Time Warp Bar and dances with SHOUT!-- one of the best bands in greater Cleveland. Our service was excellent, the staff warm and friendly, and we filled the dance floor with our gyrations. We will definitely be back. I do suggest the table configuration on the band side be modified to increase seating space."}
{"text":"Strange but fun bar! Always fun with live music! They need to tear down the middle wall and make it one big room though.  Pool tables are a plus! Cheap drinks too! It's pretty fun!  :)"}
