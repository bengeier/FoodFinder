{"text":"Lots of choice, very decent portions and excellent price! Often staying for long periods at the Crowne Plaza (Carlson Court), I enjoy the good food and fast delivery. Minimum order for delivery is 15$, so I go for a soup, a main course and a drink. That barely makes it to 15$ and that's plenty of food! Had very good experience with Wonton soup, Egg drop & mushroom soup, Beef & cashews, and Shanghai noodles. Bonus: very friendly delivery people!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The Shanghai noodles are my favourite! Super fast delivery! They are so friendly and it's reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"ordered:  shrimp fried rice, ken ken chicken wings, stir fried bok-choy, lobster and shrimp with black bean sauce, and salty fried squid. food was made fast and made very well. flavours were very satisfying.   the shrimp fried rice was moist and full of juicy large shrimp the dish tasted great.  the ken ken chicken wings are a sweet and spicy sauce on a crispy chicken wing, very satisfying.  the lobster and shrimp sauce comes with ground pork, it is in a black bean base. Flavours were rich and well balanced and its meaty and well made with good portion size.  if this review seems a bit long it's only because I want to do the staff justice. the service is what made this place stand out. you get a fast food environment with passionate service. The man who took my order was professional, and eager to provide any teaching I asked for and answered all my questions about his dishes. in the end when I left with  my order he even gave me suggestions on how to best combine his items  (shrimp fried rice and lobster/ shrimp sauce on top) to make the best of the flavours and further improve the enjoyment of the food. I've eaten at a lot of restaurants, and have been disappointed many times.... this place however, has thoroughly impressed me. The Setting is great for a quick lunch or dinner. personally I did take out and was very pleased with the food and service here, the next time I'm near kipling/ dixon I know where to go! great job!"}
{"text":"Very oily food. Service is not quick during rush times. I have experienced a lot better and with the wait times I've gotten recently, I might as well just cook at home. Has nothing in the way of atmosphere. It's very much a fast food type atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner using the Just Eat app, where they have free delivery for orders over $20.   I ordered the Veggie spring rolls, honey garlic chicken, and pineapple chicken fried rice. It was decent - the honey garlic chicken was a bit sweeter than I was expecting and too much breading but still tasted okay. The rice was my favourite - lots of pineapple and fair amount of chicken. I'll probably order food here again, but not the honey garlic chicken.   Delivery was quick and the food was hot and fresh when it arrived. The driver was very friendly and I tipped him on the Just Eat app when I paid on there. It made the transaction very simple - as soon as he arrived with my food, I didn't have to try and hold everything while paying on a mobile machine at the front door like when you order pizza."}
{"text":"Placing an order was easy, the food wasn't oil-y like the typical Chinese restaurants I've ordered from in the past. The seasoning was on point and it was good. Delivery took 45 minutes which I didn't mind since I'm on vacation anyways."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. My wife and I stopped in for a quick bite of lunch since we were in the area. The plates are quite large for the price and the quality of food is impeccable. Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly. The staff was very friendly and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food not the typical brown gravy dishes. Healthy and appearing. I ordered the delivery, fast and take card on the spot!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food, fast service, big portions.  The only complain is the plaza where its located, it's always such a pain to park and somehow everyone that can't drive in Toronto meets as this parking lot."}
{"text":"Horrible. The food flavour is disgusting and to top it all off the driver expects a tip.."}
{"text":"Ordered food from a hotel. Food took a little bit over an hour to arrive which was ok, they did deliver to the room instead of meeting at the lobby. Food came hot and they included a plate and fork which was a nice touch. Fried vegetable dumplings were delicious and moist and portion sizes in general were good. Unfortunately this is where it goes downhill. Ordered \"crispy fried wonton\" and what I thought I would get was either vegetable or meat filled crispy wonton. Instead what I got would be best described as \"wonton shells\". Literally a box of wonton wrappings. No meat, no veg, nothing. Onto the main course I ordered szechuan beef which unusually didn't come with rice so I had to go without. The beef dish itself was pretty poor. It had absolutely no spiciness and just tasted very greasy. Wasn't the worst food I have ever eaten but I wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"Omg, so  good. The best. I  use to order from the Mandarin , they are good but the Gourmet Express was the best I  ever had .I will always order from this place. Yum ,Yum.;-)"}
{"text":"This is the place to be for lunch if your in the area. They offer combo deals, best of all foods always on point and very shareable. Affordable, fresh and good! I had a combo 3. Vegetable fried rice, beef with mixed vegetables and an amazing egg roll. Couldn't finish the whole thing. Try it!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is fresh and delicious, prices are low and portion sizes big, what else can you ask for"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good place for delivery. This joint was highly rated, so went with them in spite of the reviews about the delivery guy.   Ordered the honey garlic chicken, black bean chicken, Hunan chicken, and Cantonese chow mein.   If I was nitpicking I'd say the spring rolls weren't greasy enough to my liking, and the Hunan could've had more meat in it (like every Chinese place).   Food reheated well too.   Easiest 5/5 rating"}
{"text":"Ordered a set meal from menu for delivery. Person taking phone was friendly and delivery guy was nice as well.  Asked whether set meal which included chicken chow mein was actually noodles or just chop suey and was told it was egg noodles.  Chop suey was delivered with a little bag of hard noodles.    Flavour was not great.  Other typical food items rice etc were just not appetizing.  Each was close but something missing in each case.  Order took a little over an hour to arrive but was still warm.  Probably wouldn't order again from here."}
{"text":"This place has a variety of mostly Chinese and some Japanese dishes. I ordered a variety of dishes for takeout to get a taste, and they were all pretty good! The sweet and sour soup and gyoza were delicious. The General Tso chicken was good, too, but it was listed as spicy and then wasn't spicy at all... So that was a bit disappointing.  The staff is friendly and there is quite a bit of seating area inside if you're looking to dine in."}
{"text":"Always my go to place for delivery when I'm in the area  Cantonese chow mien is crispy with the right amount of veggies and meat to noodle ratio, the price is perfect  Delivery is always early I usually get it in 40 mins or less which makes me so happy"}
{"text":"Great taste and value.  Huge portions at a low price. Spicy Thai noodles was nice, although I prefer regular Pad Thai. Cantonese Chow Mein had big pieces of meat. Will come again next time near Pearson Airport."}
{"text":"I just moved back to the area after 3 years and I remember as a kid coming here with my parents on the Friday afternoon to get takeout, the food was great all the time but just recently I thought it would be a good idea I ordered chicken fried rice, deep fried chicken wings and chicken lo mein with veggies (can you tell I like chicken) lol. When I got home to eat my dinner there was something odd to me the food didn't have a smell...and then I tried the chicken lo mein it literally taste like nothing maybe that's the MSG in the food and so did the rest or the food I didn't even bother eating the chicken wings my appetite was lost.... Long story short I ended up making mac and cheese for dinner I wasted perfectly good money. I had such high hopes for this place but I am currently looking for a new Chinese spot to dine at in the Rexdale area.."}
{"text":"As cheap Chinese food goes in the West End, this place is very solid; better than other alternatives in Etobicoke.  This isn't amazing cuisine, but it's an accommodating place with great service, fast delivery, big portions at great prices, and good food for what it is.  The hits are slightly above average.  The misses are to be avoided.  Favorites here include...  Beef With Black Bean Sauce - They do a nice black bean sauce here, which is pretty hard to screw up but deserves mention regardless.  Beef is tender and thinly sliced, and while it's not an amazing cut of meat, you'll certainly find worse in similar establishments.  Hunan Chicken - The Hunan sauce is sweet and, if you request it, satisfyingly spicy.  Like the beef, the chicken is thinly sliced and tender, and a bit of a step up from other Chinese places in the area or your typical Mandarin fare.    Shanghai Noodles - They do really good Shanghai noodles here.  Thick with a good firmness, the noodles stand up to being manipulated with chopsticks or a fork, and have a bit of flavor to them.  The quantity of toppings - pork, shrimp, and veggies - is generous as well.  I'm a Shanghai noodle fan, and while they can only really be *so* good, I think the version here's as good as it gets from a Chinese takeout place.  Good stuff!  Chicken Lo Mein - Order it extra crispy, and the noodles will stand up well to the sauce they're served in, complementing the textures of the chicken and the veggies.  There are better chow meins downtown, but for the area this is quite solid.  It's the default order here for one of my friends, and an occasional order for me.  Things to avoid:   -Anything involving breaded chicken, like their General Tao.  Too much breading, not enough chicken, and what chicken there is can be fatty and unpleasant.  This is sad, because I'm a huge General Tao fan.  -Anything with a \"chili sauce\" or \"szechuan sauce,\" which is going to be a surprisingly thick red gloppy goo.  You do not want this.  As mentioned before, they're really accommodating here.  If you want to add or subtract anything from a dish, they won't bat an eyelash; I order virtually everything added broccoli, because I'm a huge veggie hound and broccoli is nature's flavor mop.  :3  I have family who live a few blocks from here, and delivery is almost frighteningly quick.  Don't get me wrong, noodle dishes can take up to 30 minutes to arrive, but if I just order something like a beef dish, a chicken dish, and some rice, I'm not surprised when it arrives at my door within ten to fifteen minutes.  If you don't live in Etobicoke, this is not a tourist destination.  If you DO live in the area, then this is one of the best delivery options around.  Just know that they do some things very well, and other things not well at all."}
{"text":"Second attempt.. I regret leaving a bad review the first time.. from the choices I made and the taste of the food today.. I got the Hunan chicken (Extra Spicy) beef in black beans sauce, Cantonese Chow Mein and Hot and sour soup.   The hot and sour soup was okay but a bit bland  The Cantonese chow mein was delicious! And the noodles were crispy, the gravy softens them up, and it was very flavorful yum!  The beef in black bean sauce was really good.. probably the best one I had so far.. you can't go wrong with it but there is something about there sauce that just makes it extra better.  The Hunan Chicken was very sweet and a spicy at the same time and the chicken doesn't have fat, it was actually Real Chicken this time! I would definitely re-order it again.. first time trying it too!   Okay.. after this review, I recommend!"}
{"text":"I get food from here whenever I'm in Toronto. Food is absolutely delicious, with the perfect amount of spice and flavor. Portions are huge and prices reasonable. I usually get take-out, with about a 5-10 min wait. My favorites are the singapore noodles, chicken corn soup, and broccoli dish."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat. Prices are good, staff are very friendly, and the food is always fresh. Sometimes you may have to wait a few minutes, but that is because your food is cooked fresh, not refried or microwaved."}
{"text":"Decent all around Chinese food.  Nice portion.  They delivered to my hotel which was great!  They even gave me a plate and a fork!  Thank you for that.  Only downside was the $15 minimum for delivery but there isn't a delivery charge on top of your food, so that balances out."}
