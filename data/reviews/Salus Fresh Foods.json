{"text":"Love this place! Amazing, healthy food. Love their salads, it's the perfect work lunch."}
{"text":"Great spot that just opened up.  Noticed in when I walked by the area.  The thing that stood out for me was the chicken in the bowl - I like my protein and this chicken was cooked perfectly.  All around a good healthy meal.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out.  Staff seemed very friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place! 
I have been here at least 10 times recently and it's great.
Fresh ingredients, a great selection and it's nice to support a small business.
I usually order a large signature box, as it's not that much more $$ than a small. Any leftovers are eaten at lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the salad but was disappointed that the portion was not as generous as I've read on reviews :("}
{"text":"Went to Salus for lunch and we ordered two vegan wraps and a custom box, with a drink and 
and all for $30.00. food was great, with lots of fresh
ingredients in wraps and box. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love fresh food that tastes amazing and makes me feel amazing. You'd think it would be an easy concept but in reality it's not easy to find healthy unprocessed food. I went to Freshii for years until I found Salus Fresh Foods. The most incredible thing is that you can taste the difference and feel the difference after you've eaten. You also get to pick different options to include in your meal. 

My favourite option is the wrap with brown rice and vegetables, especially love the broccoli. If I do want steak they serve great cuts that aren't processed heavily like they serve at other places. The owner Adam is very approachable and walks the walk when it comes to promoting a healthy lifestyle.

Factor this out. At McDonald's, a Big Mac combo with fries and a coke is going to run you about the same as a wrap at Salus. To me it's a no brainer as to which option to pick. You don't have to spend a ton of money to eat fast and fresh food. Salus Fine Foods proves this point.

I respectfully disagree with one of the other reviews that says \"This place is like the friend that you call out when you've ran out of options...\". To me, this is like calling your best friend that points you to the best available option."}
{"text":"Nice, clean, modern-looking space, and boatloads of fresh ingredients. This was the best salad I've had in ages - quinoa with heaps of vegetables and properly cooked, fresh chicken. A massive portion left me feeling full and satisfied - but I'll be back soon for more."}
{"text":"this is as good as it gets for people who are all about eating healthy! such a large portion, so much selection, and every single ingredient is so fresh. i kid you not, every single thing about this meal was perfect. plus it was such a good price!
they should start offering loyalty cards cuz i can see myself eating here every day"}
{"text":"I discovered Salus few weeks ago...it's my best discovery so far! Amazing salads and many healthy options, not to forget the super friendly and helpful staff. The also do catering and their pricing is very reasonable. Love this place and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"pretty good! i had a wrap which i customized and added steak to- they give you a pretty generous portion of steak for $2.99. veggies were fresh and crispy. would come back."}
{"text":"We ordered a rice bowl and salad from this place (via UberEATS) tonight and they were amazing! Delicious, good sized portions, and reasonably priced. Will definitely be making this one of my go-tos!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. I tell everyone I know about it. The quality of the food is incredible, always fresh, made and prepared in house. Tastes like they actually sincerely care about the ingredients. I love that they don't over season any of the meats so you never have to worry about additives and other crap in your food. All of their sauces are served on the side (thank you for this) and they are amazing! So many vegan and gluten free options. 


Plus, the bowl is super filling, satisfying, and will leave you feeling great and energized. And for a perfectly reasonable price tag.

If you're looking for a healthy lunch/dinner/snack/whatever, look no further. This is my fav healthy lunch spot in the city by far. Keep killing it Salus!!"}
{"text":"This new spot on Carlton is awesome. Blows places like Freshii and IQ out of the water. Had the Gusto box with chicken and it was spot on. The chicken was extremely tender and flavourful, had them add their house made cilantro lime dressing which was also awesome. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I don't usually comment on other people's takes but since there is only one for this location, I feel the need to note that I'm shocked there is negative feedback as it relates to portion sizing & value. In fact, prior to Salus opening in the path, I was a frequent IQ customer and have not been back since. Compared to IQ or other \"box\" offerings, Salus provides materially more value for the same price or less ($12.24 taxes in). You can feel the weight of the box when they hand it to you (mind you, I typically get a 50/50 quinoa/lettuce mix and add protein). 

This is not to mention the quality of the food. In my experience, protein is always perfectly cooked, not dried out and deliciously seasoned - more than you can say for its competitors. The variety, freshness and quality of toppings is second to none (roasted broccoli and the spicy roasted chickpeas stand out for me), while all of the sauces are made in house and truly delicious. I know I'm not alone in this view as seemingly each time I go lunch lines get longer. It's somewhat tucked away near the Marcello's & Booster Juice but do yourself a favour and find i"}
{"text":"Quick, fresh, and delicious! Their menu is changed up from time to time to and so do their toppings so you won't get bored eating here. It's my favourite spot to grab a healthy dinner en route home."}
{"text":"Wow, being from Los Angeles I thought I had seen all health food trends. I have never seen such an eclectic menu with such unique dishes. The Palta salad was absolutely delicious.  My wife who is a vegan raved about the vegan wrap.  The food was so fresh. That is saying a lot being from California. 
Highly recommend this restaurant for health conscious consumers who want there food to taste fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Salus is an incredible recent find, and I can't wait to grab my future lunches and dinners here!

Salus is a small grab-and-go spot off of Yonge and Carlton, offering a wide variety of boxes, salads, and wraps. So far, I've been getting the customized salad, which gives you 7 toppings, excluding protein. Although quite cheap on its own ($7.99), you will find that adding protein can result in your meal adding up to anywhere between $11-14.

I find Salus to offer one of the freshest and best-tasting salads out of all the quick-service places I have tried. I especially enjoy their array of salad dressings, my favourite being cilantro lemon. Their chicken is not dry and tasteless, and the 7 toppings adds complex flavour and texture to your salad.

They also offer snacks such as house-made power balls and chia pudding. 

All in all, a great, affordable healthy spot."}
{"text":"Healthy, fast, great portion, great flavour! 
It's close to King subway station. And it just opened a new store around Union subway station at the time in writing this! Meaning this is really good! 
I worked around the neighbourhood and there are many food options for me everyday. But whenever I thought of being healthy, this is my go-to place! 
I had bravocado salad bowl with beef the first time visited. It tasted very good! 
I also tried corntrolla, see my pictures. It tasted a little bit spicy with some acidity. 
You could also create your own bowl or switch it to wrap instead of a bowl! 
If you like healthy food, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"So good. Was looking for a healthy lunch spot in the area and I'm so happy I found it. Did the build your own box and every time I try to describe it to someone I realize I forgot some ingredients because it's so packed full. Tasty, filling and healthy. Oh and also? There's a stamp card."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place in Toronto! What an awesome spot for affordable & healthy food."}
{"text":"Newly opened in the Scotia plaza close to marcellos and king station. I ordered through ritual app . I got picked up my order with no hassle but the value for it wasn't the greatest. $10 for a small box of salad with no protein. Maybe they spent a bit more on the quinoa but the quinoa to salad ratio wasn't the best. Don't think the ingredients were organic either. Should order two boxes if you want to be full."}
{"text":"Great and pretty affordable way to eat healthy. Love the group of guys and gals in there, always super helpful!

The create your own box is very filling, 7 toppings is a lot! I once got the large box and it was more than enough for 2 meals.

Definitely recommend the sesame ginger dressing!"}
{"text":"Salus boxes are amazing value and actually taste fresh (my favourite is the Corntrolla w/ shrimp). I work nearby in the area and there is considerable competition for other healthy lunch spots but Salus can't be beat when it comes to portion size, quality and service! 

The variety is great without being overwhelming and the meals are filling without feeling unhealthy. Unpretentious and delicious food with awesome service. 

The team has catered several work events I have attended and they are a hit every time. Can't reccommend Salus enough!"}
{"text":"Definitely a step above the other salad chains.  Toppings are fresh and generous.  Had the Corntrolla with a sriracha dressing and it was delicious.  Prices reflect the higher quality though so don't expect a cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Good but nothing standout. This place is like the friend that you call out when you've ran out of options...

I ordered a custom box from Ritual with brown rice, avocado, carrots, beets, roasted broccoli, roasted sweet potato, pineapples, cucumbers, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, feta cheese and caribbean mango dressing on the side. The box was of a very good size for a lunch  but I was disappointed upon opening the box to find that it was 2/3 empty... Why use such a big box and fill it up to the 1/3 instead of using smaller boxes?

I was disappointed with the sparse amount of avocado (one slice), the raw beets (I had assumed that they would be pickled since those are most commonly used in salads), the three chunks of roasted broccoli and less than 10 sunflowers seeds. Im also pretty glad I had asked for the dressing on the side as it was pretty oily and I ended up only using half of it. 

Despite the small quantity of food, I was left a comfortable level of full."}
{"text":"Amazing food in a very nice small local close to College Station.  Plenty of healthy options for reasonable prices (Below $15 including meal and beverage). Really good flavor, clean place and good service.  My only advice to the owners is about the avocado portions size..."}
{"text":"I originally found out about this place through a sponsored video on Facebook. I noticed it was right across from my office and decided to give it a try, but kept my expectations low as the video was sponsored content. 

It's a fairly small establishment and only offers around 10 spots to sit an eat along the walls. We were greeted by a helpful employee who explained the various menu offerings of the establishment. I opted to build my own box - it comes with 7 ingredients, meat, sauce, and some extra toppings (ie. raisins) of your choice. Everything tasted very fresh, especially the lettuce and kale which made a great base for the salad. The portion size was much bigger than I expected for the price, which came to about $12. The decor along the wall is also super cute! The only thing I'd say is I wish they provided more sauce, but I'll definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Salus has definitely become a favourite spot for delicious, healthy, and affordable salad bowls. Their jam-packed salads and flavourful sauces will fill you up for $10 - what a steal! They also have extremely friendly service and Instagram-worthy interior decor. Plus, get your first order on Ritual for only $5!"}
{"text":"I tried this place twice so far, the food is delicious, fresh, healthy, highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Close to yonge and college, an extremely healthy and clean place with wraps and boxes.

I'm typically a box guy so I went for the Gusto box.

brown rice, avocado, shredded carrots, grape tomato, sweet corn, black beans, shredded cabbage, goat cheese, roasted chicken, sriracha

Everything was good and fresh, but its so hard to cook chicken to taste good in a healthy way. I think I'll try a different box next time like the Cabezza with salmon or a custom box with grilled steak.

Overall a much needed fresh fast food place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Affordable, delicious and healthy AF. I'm coming here regularly, and will keep doing that. I have nothing to complain.

They have a good loyalty program, or you can use Rituals (either one) and save yourself on lunch money. Honestly this is what keeps me coming back the most."}
{"text":"Great spot! Will definitely be coming back!! Food is delicious and healthy - the best combo!"}
{"text":"For a meal you won't regret, grab a Salus box. The price is reasonable (can be less than  $10!), the food is fresh and your body won't fall into a food coma afterwards. I was looking for a healthy light dinner before an event and this was exactly the place to go! 

I had the small box with quinoa as a base and various toppings on top. It looked small in the box (probably because it also needs to hold more voluminous bases like salads), but I was really full after finishing it. The service is quick and efficient, and they are happy to explain anything I didn't understand.

For dining in, there is a row of counter space facing the street that you can people-watch at while you eat!"}
{"text":"Great lunch option in the area. Fresh, healthy, affordable - comparable to Freshii, but better quality and not a chain :-)"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place out, and boy, am I sorry I didn't sooner!! I just had the best lunch in a very long time. Eating healthy on the road is definitely not an easy task, but these guys make it possible, AND it's delicious and super filling. There are so many options, it was hard to choose. I went for the Controlla with falafel as my protein, and it was amazing. Very reasonably priced, extremely fresh, and very friendly staff. Overall, very enjoyable experience and I will definitely be coming back soon! Thanks guys :)"}
{"text":"Just came here and decided to try their new salads since I eat salads daily. They have great service and amazing salads. I was blessed because they literally finished cooking the chicken so it was extremely fresh. Chicken was cooked PERFECTLY and everything was extremely tasty. Lots of variety and great suggestions. Definitely coming back. S+++"}
{"text":"Very cute salad spot! The price is right for the quality and portion. This is not the kind of salad place you would feel hungry after having a pricy tiny portion. It actually decent portion size, get some grains like the quinoa. 
I love to build my own salad and you get up to 7 choices. And they are nice could mix and match the leafy greens. The roasted broccoli has this grilled char wonderful taste to it. The cilantro lemon dressing is refreshing. Think this is as healthy and fresh as it could get. Very friendly service and don't forget to get your card stamped, you would want to come back for more deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I was recently requested to place an order for a meeting at work. Came across this place online  - so conveniently located at Yonge and Carlton.   I dealt with Adam. He made everything easy for me.  Having the customizable options and choice of salad, wrap or box fit everybody's personal preference. Very affordable, healthy, good portioned meals.  Everything tastes great and everybody was very happy!"}
{"text":"I know you're not supposed to make friends with salad, but trust me: you're going to make friends with Salus. 

Whenever I'm craving something fresh and healthy, I head here. You can choose from one of their creations or you can customize your own, which is usually the best option. Choose from a grain or green base and build it from there. The salad topping bar has literally everything you could ever want from quinoa to avocado. Plus, you can add a protein in. Mmm, I'm getting hungry. 

When I'm feeling a bit lazy, I'll order the Bravocado (spinach, quinoa, avocado, beets, roasted broccoli, cucumber, strawberry, edamame, goat cheese, dried cranberries, balsamic). The boxes are huge and the prices just right ($10-12) not including tax. 

It's a grab and go spot, but there are some spots to eat too. Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Everything is super fresh and the price is very reasonable. The service is quick. You have lots of choices of healthy and filling lunch."}
{"text":"Ohhh my gosh this place. I can't get enough of the amazing food here. In my quest to eat a more plant-based and conscious diet, I've been coming here once a week. Their bowls are quite a substantial meal for a very decent price--custom boxes start at 7.99 and go up if you add certain items (avocado, meat protein, extra toppings), but it's such a huge selection! Their sauces are also all very good. Unfortunately my plant-based diet also comes with added chicken, but I'm going to work on phasing that out as soon as I can.

The staff here are all really open and friendly and willing to help you with your selection or any questions you might have. One of the staff team helped my friend decide on a sauce for his meal, and he loved it! I'm pretty boring, as I have only been getting sesame ginger, but we'll work on that too. I promise.

I believe this is one of the better places that gives you a healthy option for a good, affordable price. I don't get that awful sickly feeling I get from eating too much, so A+ for that! Will definitely be back on Tuesday :)"}
{"text":"Best salad ever! Im not a big salad person but stumbled upon this healthy looking restaurant while venturing around downtown after work with my friend! I tried the large salad with the ginger dressing and my friend had chicken and rice with the ranch dressing! It was very tasty and portion size was very reasonable. Apparently the owner makes his own dressings which is pretty cool! Highly recommend this place!
(Repost from my google review)"}
{"text":"Came into this place because I work in the area and had a quick smoothie. The service was spectacular - Adam, the owner, asked if I had any special requests or allergy needs. He is very conscientious and wants to really encourage a healthy lifestyle not fake healthy foods like freshii and those other types of places. Definitely recommend this to anyone who needs things on the go or catering for events!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place and alternative for healthy light lunch and/or dinner! Been there twice for custom box with brown rice and custom salad. 7.99 for regular size box is pretty fair considering the downtown location."}
{"text":"Great choice if you're looking for fresh salads. There are many topping choices to choose from."}
{"text":"I must have come on an off day because I see there are so many amazing reviews... and the photos of the food look so good!  I was so happy to discover a healthy option close to home and wanted to love this place so much.  The guys that worked there were great, answered all my questions and were generally very helpful as it was my first time here.


My issue was with the steak I ordered... it looked nothing like the photos, instead it was dried out, overcooked and way too salty.  Honestly, it was just really bad and inedible. I could tell it would be bad as soon as I opened the box but it was worse than I thought with the extreme saltiness, together with the dried out texture. I ended up just not eating it but all the rest of the salad ingredients were good.  My only other complaint is just that it comes with 1 dressing and I found it wasn't enough.  


I will probably give this place one more attempt but at this point, it will be hard for me to want to eat here again when I know I can make a much better salad at home.  I want badly to like this place - I wish for more healthy food options close to home and I want the ones that already exist to thrive.  Will update when I eventually try this place again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come in at least once a week!  We usually split a large with chicken for $13 or so (that's with tax) and you get to choose 9 toppings!  It fills us both!  Its extremely healthy, fast and convenient.  Staff is always super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Finally a healthy place to grab lunch that isn't $$$$$$ for a salad.  The prices here are very reasonable and for the price you get a really good portion of food. They have salads, wraps, bowls, smoothies and a lot of customizable options. 

I went for the customizable salad box which was $7.99 plus tax for my lettuce of choice, 7 veggies, 2 legumes, 2 beans, 1 nut and 1 cheese.  I didn't even think I could pick 7 veggies to add in but I did and the result was a massive salad that was soooooo delicious and filling. Everything was very fresh! You can also add meats to your salad such as chicken, steak, shrimp etc. I found out that the meats are freshly cooked and it gets sliced right in front of you and topped on your salad or bowl so that you're not eating cold chicken!!!! I was so happy to find this out as cold meat on a salad is upsetting! 

I can't wait to check this place out again and try some of their other menu items. Very impressed so far!"}
{"text":"Wow. Love this new place. I have already been back a few times since I discovered it a couple weeks ago. Been having shakes and custom salads. The salmon is out of this world and the greens are super fresh.  Super quick even when there is a line and perfect for a working lunch. New fave spot"}
{"text":"Dropped by Salus Fresh Foods after a long painful trip to the mall for Christmas shopping. 

Salus' vibrant salad definitely brighten up my day! The store is well lite with a faux grass wall and modern decor! 

I used an mobile app to place and order in advance and made the rookie mistake of placing an order with just chicken and rice. Upon arriving, the owner Brant informed me that my dinner is not yet ready as he wanted to confirmed the order with me. Praise the lord! There is a Christmas miracle for me after all! 

I placed and order for a custom box with choice of whole grain, 7 vegetables, 2 legumes, nuts, cheese, chicken and dressing! It was a massive portion - enough for two meals! I am delighted with the flavour profile of the cilantro dressing and the freshness of the ingredients! The grilled vegetables were not only perfectly seasoned, it also added depth to the otherwise simple salad.

Needless to say, I will be back! Hands down Salus'  fresh approach to food will beat out it's competition in the neighborhood. 

Ahem, yes, I am looking at you, Feshii. 

Pro tip: the owner's favorite dressing is hummus mixed with sirracha!"}
{"text":"Great Food & Service! Definitely coming back. Convenient location and very clean. Selection was more than expected for a salad bar-health conscious restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy and filling! Lots of fresh ingredients and the chicken was grilled perfectly. The guys here are also super friendly, will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"They're pretty basic (SURPRISE SURPRISE!). However, the fact that they allow you to fully customize your order with the ingredients right in front of you is lit when you want a fresh ass salad. It was a lil unsettling that my salmon was pre shredded, especially because I paid $13 for the salad in the first place. Y'all trynna be stingy w my salmon, you may want to reconsider the purpose of your establishment."}
