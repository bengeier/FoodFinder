{"text":"Very nice small shop. We had delicious breakfast sandwiches. Very reasonably priced. Cute small patio out front. Helpful staff."}
{"text":"The worst salad I've ever had.
15 dollars should get u a pretty good salad but not with this place. It's disgusting.
Avacado was full of vinegar. (Paid extra(
Cesar salad had tomatoes in it 
No Parmesan like they said 
Croutons were something u get at iga not home made.
Chicken is fake and rubbery.
Cesar dressing water

Friends wrap had chunks of funky turkey and way to many dates. No mandarins that he paid extra for.
Salad had no dressing.

Honestly highly disappointed and would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Super fresh wraps and salads made to order. You get a large portion for the money paid. Prices start around $7 and go up as you add toppings. Ciabata sandwiches are also available but are premade. Menu is in french only but staff spoke English and were very accommodating."}
{"text":"My salad had thawed chunks of mango that were tasteless and powdery, barely red tomatoes that were also tasteless and a supposedly citrus dressing that was full of sugar. A salad is supposed to be about tasting fresh ingredients, something that was almost impossible here."}
{"text":"Located inside Place Ville-Marie right beside the Starbucks, this place has a huge variety of salads and a few soups. I came during peak lunch hours and service was pretty quick - less than a 5 minute wait. There are two ways of ordering - either with the check-off-the-box sheets by the salad bar, so that the staff can easily put your salad together. Or, you can pick one of the pre-chosen salads which include classics like Nicoise, Ceaser and also ones with a slight twist such as Asian, Chef's salad. I went with a pre-chosen Asian salad and it came with some chicken on the top, half an avocado, some tangerines all on a bed of spinach tossed with an orange sauce. While the majority of people choose to take out their salads, there is a small seating area for around 15 people."}
{"text":"Usually go there at my lunch break to grab a salad. The salads are good, good portion and affordable. I believe they do 30% after 3 o'clock on remaining salads."}

I have been to Chop Crazy so I can now compare the two. 

Laitue&Go uses measuring spoons for each salad topping to ensure you get the same amount of topping each time. At Chop Crazy they take some with their hands (they wear gloves thankfully). They have the measured spoons, I can see them, but they do not use them probably to use less topping to save more... So Laitue&Go get's an A+ for that. 

Laitue&Go gives you a bigger salad in the end and the to-go container for the dressing is bigger. The bowl is bigger than Chop Crazy; but Chop Crazy is slightly cheaper. Laitue&Go always has shredded cheddar cheese which I like on my salad. I've been to Chop Crazy twice now and they did not have it. They had other types of cheese, but not cheddar. And back to the dressing; at Chop Crazy my salad is pretty much dry by the end. I do not have this problem with the amount I get from Laitue&Go. 

So, all in all I think that for the little more you'll spend, Laitue&Go is the way to 'Go'. No pun intended. Har har.

Thanks for reading!"}
