{"text":"Recently visited this location with someone who has a dairy allergy.  Luckily they have one flavor without dairy.  And fortunately we were helped by two great, kind, and professional young men.  One server took a lot of care in washing the scooper and made sure that our order was served properly and safely. We were helped by both and they were both very nice and helpful. Would go out of my way just to get ice cream from this location."}
{"text":"This Baskin Robbins had a choice assortment of different flavors, with an option for everyone. There was even a \"no-sugar-added\" flavor (pineapple coconut). The girl who served me cheerfully offered samples as I was trying to decide, and was courteous and helpful. My ice cream was delicious and, unlike cones at other ice cream shops, did not drip over the edge immediately!"}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant visit at this location.  Went there with my son for an evening treat before we head home to Yuma, where there is no baskin robbins :-(. The employees were very nice and helpful.  We will definitely be back once were in town again."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday  (Monday) around 8pm. This used to be my favorite Baskin Robins location. Paul, Robert, and Nick are very friendly. I suppose they have a new staff of females that are not so nice. When I came in with my family half of the ice creams were closed down. The back looked ready to close shop. Three hours before you close? Felt rushed out. Definitely finding a new location."}
{"text":"Good service! The staff are friendly and patient. I love their brownie and strawberry shortcake sundaes. I like how they can heat the brownie. The portion size is good and they're rich, so I can't be eating these every week. My only gripe is that the vanilla had a little ice chips in it. I don't know how they can get rid of this. I've also had their ice cream cakes, and they're good too. You can't go wrong with ice cream & cake merged together."}
{"text":"Wow,,, they have the best ice cream ever. Coldstone is very close to my house so i had never tried here. This was first time but i was pretty impressed. They have the best ice cream and good customer service as well. I just loved it. Thinking about ordering some icecream cake from here for my birthday as well. This was a great find.."}
{"text":"Went in to get ice cream literally 30 minutes ago. I live not even 5 minutes away. I get home, my ice cream is melted due to the ice cream having been sitting on the counter since before I got there cuz it was definitely not in the freezer where it should've been. On top of that , the employee had given me the wrong ice cream! Where do you hear prailines n cream from chocolate chip cookie dough ?! Never going back again . Disappointing."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this location a lot. We love the guys that worked here but it's been females with an attitude these days. Ice cream is suppose to be fun and happy especially Baskin Robbins. We manage to be having a girl with eyelash extensions consistently serving a bad attitude. I speak fluent English and I do not need to be belittled when I'm ordering. I would like two ice creams not two scoops. I have a toddler and I always order a kids scoop not an adult scoop for her. It's not hard. I work too so I know."}
{"text":"I try....I really do...try to give them the benefit of the doubt and every time I'm disappointed...it's not necessarily the customer service...there have been a few bad seed in and out of this location...but even the good ones give all the same excuses / reasons....their training manual must have scripts for employees to memorize... All of which make the owners (who have only had this location for a couple years) appear to be tight-wad penny pinchers...

For example....ordering a 2 scoop sundae .. One would expect 2 scoops... Not 2 child size scoops that don't even full the 2 scoop cup HALF WAY...when I asked why so little ice cream, he told me .. They have to make ALL their sundaes with the child scoops...I offered to pay extra for more ice cream and he said they wouldn't know how to charge for extra ice cream...then he drownd it with hot fudge... Which of course melted the little scoops into soup...top it with whip cream and a cherry on top..well it automatically sank to the bottom.....it really does feel like your being jipped when you pay $5.00+ for a baby cup of ice cream. #iwantagrownupsundae #dontbetightwads"}
{"text":"It's 110 degrees outside and what can be more perfect than ice cream?!?

Pros - Wonderful ice cream, shakes, cakes, cookies and smoothies! Friendly and helpful staff members at this location as well. Lots of parking and it's right off Eastern near the airport.

Cons - This ice cream shop is located in a half empty strip mall off of Eastern Avenue - and there's some sketchy folks in these parts. Another downer is that there's only a few small tables inside to eat at. 

Tip --- If you download their app on your phone - you will receive a free scoop of ice cream."}
{"text":"Yummy ice cream. Good service.  I don't remember their ice cream melting so fast but maybe it was just b'c my daughter couldn't keep up!  There's a few tables to sit at so that's always nice."}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream, helpful store staff, and a very close to the freeway location. We liked it and will stop again on a future trip thru the desert."}
{"text":"I don't usually review chains I go to all the time but in this case I had to make an exception. The brownie sundae was as good as ever, but the bubbly Robin who greeted me and everyone else who came in was beyond compare.  She lit up the joint with a smile and manner that clearly put all the customers in a good mood and provided the kind of service that most retailers would go to great lengths to find and retain. She even made the effort to wish everyone a good night as they left with the sweetness of the ice cream and her positive energy. Thank you, Robin and BR for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Usually it's a good experience, however today we found some kind of paper in our ice cream while eating it... then we notice a couple of things that just made us throw our ice cream away and ended up leaving. While there's 2 girls and a guy working, when the place is that dirty, I don't think standing around doing nothing is the best thing."}
{"text":"This location was terrible.  I don't normally write bad reviews.  The employees lacked common courtesy, it was over priced and the place was disgusting.  Bathroom, trashcans, doors, everything needed a major cleaning.  We go out for ice cream every Sunday.  We won't be back here though."}
{"text":"Paul's customer service is to be envied.  I stopped by today to pick up a cake for my dad's birthday. Not only did he go out of his way to bring me a fresh cake from the back room ( there wasn't any in the right flavor in the show case ) but he created personable conversation and when exiting he asked me to wish my dad a happy birthday. This young man is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here for a two scoop sundae on 3/24.The dude that made the sundae really cheaped on the strawberries and hot fudge,barely an eyedropper amount of each.Then when I pay for it the other guy at the register immediately crumples up my receipt and goes to throw it in the trash.Apparently they are avoiding giving people $1.00 off their next purchase for doing the survey.The server's name on the receipt also looks fake,\"TILL AM\".Imagine going to Smith's or Home Depot or some other retailer and have the cashier crumple up the receipt and throw it in the trash instead of handing it to you."}
{"text":"$6 for 2 smaller than normal scoops. Baskin-Robbins how you have fallen, or it is just this location perhaps? Ice cream was too soft and melty... This place seemed dirty and depressed, and I feel a bit sick after eating it. 

Tip: The one off Dysart is a nicer experience, go there for your BR fix if not buying it at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday at 4:53 and a kid named Aaron was working. He was awesomely helpful and friendly! We will be back just because of his perfect customer service! Thank you Aaron!"}
{"text":"First time here, coming from out of town. I absolutely loved the service and they were extremely accommodating to me and my family. My partner called ahead to ask about the ice cream cakes and they put one on hold for me after they told us their options. When we got to the store, they had the cake ready and offered us other types of cakes in case we changed our minds. I ended up getting a smaller cake for the 5 of us and they let us \"celebrate\" my birthday at a table. They gave us spoons and lids as makeshift plates since they knew we couldn't take the cake to our hotel without a freezer. Thank you so much Paul and Robert! You guys made my night special!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and I love the way the guy working here, he easily accommodated us and very pleased to help us on trying some flavors!"}
{"text":"Really nice staff & clean place. They always change out the ice cream so don't get to attached to one LoL."}
{"text":"Love the Reese peanut butter cup 30 below."}
{"text":"Dessert after our late lunch! Mmmmm....what can I say? So creamy and rich. Not going to worry about calories today! This is the most convenient dessert place -- right next to Fukumimi where we just had our meal! OHMYGOSH and I ate too much there, too!"}
{"text":"I feel like the prices at Baskin Robbins keep increasing for standard ice cream.  Sure it always has that consistant taste no matter where you go, but I'd rather get frozen custard at Luv It or Nielsen's for the same (or cheaper) price with more flavor.

My friend and I went on Sunday and their A/C was out and it happened to be 117 outside.  If I had a choice between here and Coldstone, Coldstone would win easily."}
{"text":"Love Baskin-Robbins much more then Stone Cold! Wished we had more in the Valley, 
After having a hard time finding some local Thrifty ice cream open on Sunday? i used the powerful yelp finder for a ice cream near you locator! It brought me here. This place is a little small, can be very cramped if busy. But as usual, they had a lot of different flavors of ice cream. I haven't been to BR in years, since I lived in SoCal. 
Service was great, had plenty of help there, gave our girls samples to try, and very patient. We really enjoyed our visit, and will come back if were in the area."}
{"text":"CHILDHOOD MEMORIES 

Can't really go wrong with flavor wise with an ice cream shop that has lasted so many years & still capable of keeping their flavors tasting the same... at least from however young ago I remeber. 

Just made a quick stop to grab a cake for a co-worker that was leaving us & it was convenient to be able to just open up the freezer & pick out a ready togo ice cream cake. 

Got an OREO COOKIE ice cream & chocolate cake log shaped cake with chocolate glazed over with cherries on top. It was $22.99 which wasn't too bad in my opinion for the size. 

The worker was super sweet & asked if I wanted something written on it but I just didn't have time. 

Only bad thing was that it was VERY stuffy hot feeling in there... you would think to keep the inside cool on a hot day but who knows maybe the ac broke."}
{"text":"Everyone always has time for ice cream! Good portions, 1 scoop was a good size. I got 2 scoops and was not able the finish my order. So took it home and was still able the enjoy the ice cream the following day. A lot of choices available (but not 99 flavors ). There were like 5 sugar free options I think (not really sure)."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a little comfort food (aka ice cream) from Baskin robbins!?!

I got a small vanilla soft serve in a cup with rainbow sprinkles. It was very good! The rainbow sprinkles are actually fresh. (I hate it when they are stale and hard... Disgusting!!) But these were perf! Super fresh. 

The parking lot was a little icky and a little seedy (I went around 9pm) so park near the entrance!! It's not very well lit. 

The inside was clean and bright. The employees were relatively nice as well. 

Another small complaint: no public restroom. Sorry but this is really annoying to me!!! If I am a paying customer in a place that serves food and drink I deserve a trip to the restroom."}
{"text":"Agree that the ice cream and other products are awesomely delicious. My only criticism is that the 8 plus times I have gone, it it filthy. I have never seen someone cleaning other than the owner and the floors are sticky, messy, the seating area sticky and window sills dusty. Needs daily maintenance for me to honestly give it a 5. Sorry guys, good to get BR ice cream but not as pleasant as it could be if only it were CLEAN..."}
{"text":"I stopped here on my way out of town.  It has a wonderful location and even an outdoor place to sit.  Not only was the store beautiful with a plethora of cakes and mini-cones in the display, but the staff was great.  I ordered a cappuccino blast which was my favorite and he made it amazing.  I am rather picky so he was able to accommodate what I wanted.  The blast was the perfect consistency and I was glad to have stopped.  

Upon checkout he also asked if I had tried the new ice cappuccino blast and I had said no and he told me about the .99 promotion deal which was very impressive to me.  He also gave me a punch card which was great.  

This was one of the best Baskin-Robbins experiences I've had in a long time.  I really was glad to see 31 is still doing great things."}
{"text":"i hadnt been to a baskin robbins in YEARS... but we happen to see one while on the other side of town tonight n stopped in for a little treat! its not the best part of town, the parking lot is dark and there were a few shady characters hanging out... but we are not easily scared...grew up in these streets so we can adapt real quick ;) ha!! j/k it wasnt that bad... inside we were greeted by two super-friendly, smiling employees... they were pretty busy but never lost their cool... they were pleasant, joking and ON THIER GAME!! if i owned an ice cream shop, these two kids would be my first pick to train all other employees... seriously, we received phenomenal service!!! i didnt catch the guys name, but the girl was named robin.  they both deserve a raise!!! oh ya, the ice cream was good too! xD"}
{"text":"The place was clean, people seem very friendly, they seemed very accommodating. They said hello to us the moment we walked in the door. I would give it a 5-star but there was not much selection on sorbet ice cream. I really can't eat dairy products and all they had was one flavor that was dairy free. it was very clean I highly recommend anyone to go there."}
{"text":"Dirty, dirty, dirty.  Small scoops.  I can tell this place just changed management.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Ice cream is fine, but 2 major problems with this place.
 1) Why is only 1 person working? 6 people in line and very hard for the girl to keep up. I would think this is a major safety violation. If the girl is in the store alone and she faints and hits her head, you're F'd!
 2) The exhaust vent was 80% dirty with black debris. Gross! No way did this happen overnight, so this is complete neglect from the Management for several weeks. The vent is right over the prep area. If I decide to go back to this place and see this, I will turn around."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Rude and not very comprising with customers.  Kids wanted the Tuesday night ice cream special (half price after a certain time I think) , employee forced kids to wait for 5 minutes. While waiting, a large family walked in and proceeded to charge the family half price! I will never return to this place again!"}
{"text":"Another 1st to Review!

It's Freakin Baskin Robbins people-the original -31 flavors!! Great Ice Cream & Cakes.

E-Club members get a FREE scoop so I tried the NEW sherbert -Triple something with blue raspberry,fruit punch and sour apple!!!

What I got of it -Refreshing and so so good! This is still my favorite ice cream place!!:)"}
{"text":"It is hidden so just remember it's on the North-West corner of Estrella and Roosevelt.

A run of the mill Baskin-Robbins, but the furniture needs to be replaced/fixed badly.  Of course this doesn't matter if you take it home with you."}
{"text":"As good as it gets when I walk in for DAQ ice and it is free!

My free bday scoop expires this weekend, and I was overjoyed to see BR next to Fukumimi Ramen.  Randal R. was shaking his head at my eagerness to do DAQ ice like others do the dew, but I walked in, found DAQ ice immediately and squealed!  The associate asked me if I was ready and I excitedly affirmed and asked for DAQ ice on a cake cone.  Randal R. says cake cones are for kids, but at least that means I don't feel my old age yet!

I got my scoop, she scanned the barcode on my email coupon, and off we went!  He said I moaned with each lick but that is between me and the Daquiri!"}
{"text":"So I going to this location to use my free kids scoop coupon because its celebrating my birthday week and the employee Manny said that they can not use the coupon today because it is the 31st and they have some sort of promotion going on today. I told him I said well it is nowhere in the email said I could not specifically use it on this day that I had until today to use the coupon. They continue to refuse to take the coupon and I told him I said well thank you for ruining my birthday and not taking your own coupon. They said well well you could bring it in tomorrow and we'll be able to do it for you and I said no the coupon expires today and they go, oh. Last year they wouldn't take their coupon either. Not this specific location but another location on Jones and Spring Mountain. So another words they pick and choose what day and what location they will take the coupons? By the way it's pretty jacked up and I don't think... I'm just not going to go to them anymore, free or not."}
{"text":"This Baskin Robbins has the best ice cream you could possibly get! It tastes great and the service is always with a smile! On top of that, the store is so clean! I'd highly recommend that you get the Oreo ice cream or the cheesecake! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Baskin- Robbins I've ever been to anywhere in the valley! Best customer service and interactions from Paul! Genuine and kind, we will come back to this location again. Got my favorite flavor, baseball nut and tried a new flavor, lunar cheesecake. Both delicious, but the highlight of the visit was Paul"}
{"text":"This is a little late but I came here New Years Eve.  Thankfully, no one was there!  That was surprising to me though because that day Baskin Robbins were having a deal on sundaes, it was like a dollar each or something- so naturally, I thought it would be hella busy.  But nope! Everyone was probably whisked away in some drunken haze at their NYE parties.  I got to enjoy my sundae peacefully (& sober).  The people working that night were laid back and very nice.  Props to them for working a slow night on NYE."}
{"text":"I visited this Baskin Robbins tonight with my sister to each grab a cone of delicious ice cream. The parking lot is very dark and hard to navigate; also, it seems to be a pretty popular place for teenagers and interesting characters to hang out. However, the inside is cool and well lit. I was immediately greeted by two employees (both of which said hello and offered me samples). There are many delicious ice cream flavors, but I chose the Jamocha Fudge Almond. In my personal opinion, there were too many almonds in the ice cream but I know that wouldn't be a problem for most guests! The employee rang us up quickly, presented our receipt, and wished us a good day."}
{"text":"This place is a mess. One guy working for too many customers, he's too busy to properly put the scoops on the cones so they are rolling off people's cones onto the floor. Like a Charlie Chaplin movie."}
{"text":"I'm just a fat kid that love ice cream, so my review may be a little biased, but this place is the SHIZ! 
They have a vast selection of flavors to choose from, including some non-dairy options. They circulate out the flavors a lot, most of the time you could come back the next day and there will be a whole array of other flavors to be offered. Along with their handmade sundaes and shakes, there's also pints of your favorite ice cream you can take to go, or get yourself an ice cream cake. 

For two birthdays in a row for my boyfriend, this place has saved my ass when other ice cream shops have failed me with cakes. This location in particular helped me out this past July in quickly personalizing a cake for me (cute ninja turtle drawings and all) and really putting effort in helping me out while other places just shrug their shoulders at an order they had 2 weeks to not screw up on(but did).

The staff is always friendly here, most of the time there is only one person working, so if you see a group of people inside, it might be a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy day so it wasn't exactly triple digits yet.. so I couldn't come up for a reason for dropping by Baskin Robbin, LoL.. but I had the cravings I went anyway.. 

Wasn't the busy when I arrived and the workers greeted and assisted me immediately but it was hard to make up my mind.. Why do they have to have so many flavors.. why.. ; )

I got a 2 scoop Sunday with the works.. forgot the names.. something with chocolate/peanut butter and something else that was chocolaty !! can't go wrong with chocolate in my book.

When I was done they even offered to clean up.. the person I was with wasn't so clean with their ice cream. How considerate !! 5 stars !!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  Don't come in here if it's 20 minutes till close as they'll close down the Sundae station and then proceed to charge you full price for a 2 or 3 scoop Sundae.  I came in here on a Wednesday night after a Diamondbacks game, which is when one would expect to visit an ice cream parlor (at night).  The employees advised me they close down the Sundae station so it could defrost and clean it.  I couldn't get any hot toppings (caramel sauce, chocolate sauce, etc...) and I couldn't get some of the hard toppings as well (Reece's Peanut Butter Cups, etc...)  They gave me 2 small scoops of ice cream in a Sundae Cup with some whipped cream and charged me full price for a Sundae?  They actually offered me NO OPTIONS as far as what I could get in my $5.00+ Sundae!

In addition, some of the ice cream flavors were out, but they couldn't be bothered to replace the tubs with fresh ice cream as they were close to closing, so we had to choose other options!  Could you say service with a smile?  (Sarcasm).  I'll admit that it was 15 minutes to close, but there were at least 3 more groups that came in after me!  If you don't want your employees to stay late to clean, then maybe you should close the store a little earlier!  Don't stay open until 10pm if I'm going to be limited to what I could order and then ripped off as far as what I'm charged for...

I called to speak with the manager Bryer? (if that's how you spell it) and he couldn't be bothered.  He was on the phone with me, but half-listening to the conversation as he had customers in the establishment.  I asked for a return phone call and I'm still here waiting for one.  He has no resolution to the problem, offered nothing as far as compensation for the lousy experience and to be honest, had no interest in how he could make the establishment better for it's customers.  Let's just say a manager who could care less...

I wouldn't recommend going here if it were the last ice cream spot in the West Valley. The customer service is horrible, they can't be bothered and they have no interest in doing what's right for the customer.  If you want to spend $5.00+ for 1/2 a cup of ice cream, then sure, come here.  But if you could go to the grocery store and get 2 1/2 gallons for what you spend on one Sundae here, I'd recommend that.  I'd pay the price if I get what I pay for.  And to be honest, I'd say I'd pay the price for their 1/2 cup of ice cream if I got good customer service, but I got neither.  Very small portions with no options and lousy customer service!"}
{"text":"This location is-Eh...okay. For much of the summer the ice cream was half melted. They seem to have fixed that problem. My other issues with this location center around cleanliness/sanitation. Went there last night. We were the only ones there and the two employees were in the back. One was on her phone and did not look like she wanted to be bothered. Incidentally, every table was filthy. I can understand if you're busy not being able to clean up quickly after every customer, but there was nothing going on and the tables were in serious need of wiping.  Then the other employee came out and went to wait on us after touching his hair and not washing his hands. My husband had to tell him to wash his hands. Things are not always this bad but last night had us not eager to return.

Went there tonight because my kids wanted ice cream. Had to ask the employee to wash his hands after handling money. Who trains these folks?"}
{"text":"Ice cream shop, always refreshing and the flavors rotate so you don't' get bored.  I enjoy just plano two scoops in a cup, but my husband always gets a Sunday of his making with fruit and nuts and whip cream.  I thought I had the sweet tooth!  This store is always quiet, quick with service and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Very dirty store, I haven't been in a baskin robbins in several years and only came here so my grandson could get his free cone for reading books. Wouldnt come here again,  sitting here while my grandson eats his ice cream allows me to see even more filth. Everything is dirty. When I worked at Baskin Robbins in high school you could eat off of anything. Us kids took pride in that store and kept everything clean.  This store needs a lot of cleaning."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for service! Greeted with smiles and hellos right when we walked through the door. It was pretty busy but they got to us right away. Paul was the guy who helped us. He's very friendly and talkative! Definitely made the experience at a normal Baskin Robbins better than usual! He accepted our coupon and was more than happy to serve us. We got a bunch of yummy samples and he was true to his word! Got offered a free waffle cone because we got double scoops!! Just wanted to yelp about my pleasant experience. Oh and I got the mocha and chocolate! Super basic but super rich and yummy!"}
{"text":"Great place love there ice cream they are a little high price for what you get. Very nice there service is good stop by and try"}
{"text":"I can't resist me some daiquiri ice. Love the stuff and it's one of the only reasons you'll ever find me in a Baskin Robbins. 

We came here for a sweet after our extra savory and delicious meal at Fukumimi. The service was pretty friendly and they keep the shop pretty clean. That's key for me."}
{"text":"Baskin-Robbins is just perfect. I'm in love with ice cream, so maybe I could be biased. The staff is excellent and asking by phone is a great experience. 

The store is always clean, fresh and everyone has a friendly smile. 

It is a great place to go with children, especially with the deals on Tuesdays for more savings. It is a place that always has new flavors of ice cream and milkshakes. The birthday cakes are perfectly great for any occasion. I might have to get one for my birthday too!"}
