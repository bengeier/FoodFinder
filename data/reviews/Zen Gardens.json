{"text":"Great restaurant. The price are on the pricey side but the quality is ok and I would recommend to people who like veggie and chinese foods. One minor complaint is that they do not serve tea like most chinese restaurant. They charge you if you want tea. IT is fine for some but I would prefer they not to charge like other chinese restaruatn"}
{"text":"Tasty Chinese food! It was quite a large meal and everything was delicious.  It's so nice to have a Chinese restaurant where vegetarians can actually order every single thing on the menu. Felt overwhelming (in a nice way) to choose what I wanted."}
{"text":"Food ***** - Service ***** - Ambience *****  This was the 1st restaurant i went to after i arrived in Canada and it is still my favourite.  We have been so so many times, we can simply recite the menu.   Strongly recommended"}
{"text":"Went there for a mega celebratory meal for passing my board exams and for my birthday- and was not disappointed. One of the top 3 vegetarian places I've been to in my life. The waiting staff - friendly, efficient, and really helpful describing the menu. Portions were generous, and the food was amazing..  Ingredients were very fresh. Planning on making this one of my regular haunts."}
{"text":"Zen Gardens restaurants are top notch!  I've always had fantastic customer service, delicious food.  Very helpful staff, one young man took the time to show me some pictures of the dishes on his phone because I was trying to order something specific and couldn't remember which it was on the menu, thank you!  I love Zen Gardens seitan dishes, crispy, bbq, and the platter.  Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Surprised to find a Chinese vegan restaurant where it is - middle of Suburban, but it seemed quite popular judging from the number of people there when we went on a Friday night.  Nice decor and more classy feel and service, which probably is why the price is a bit higher than some other chinese vegetarian restaurants, e.g. Lotus.  The food quantity was also a little less, but still adequate.  We ordered 2 large soup (one hot and sour, one mixed veggie), Kung Pao \"chicken\", spicy eggplant, bbq \"pork\" and another dishes which I can't remember.  All the food dishes were pretty well done, although not spectacular in my opinion.  The best was the bbq \"pork\", which was really tasty.  Hot and sour soup is not too good, mixed veggie soup was better.  The place also seemed to have an extensive selection of tea, with nice displays of different teas.  There seemed to be a separate section set aside specifically for tea-tasting, although we didn't venture to try.  Overall, I probably would still prefer Lotus than this mainly due to the quantity, price, and taste of the food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Zen Gardens! I've been coming here for many years. I'm vegetarian, but most of my friends and family are not and even they love this place! My favourites are: hot and sour soup, seitan, drumsticks and the sweet and sour bites. I fully recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Double the tip on Enoki Mushroom balls. They are so good!  Also digging the hot and sour soup, Spicy Eggplant Dish, and the fried rice dish with Pine Nuts.  Bring a group, as the portions are big, and you can do sharsies.  The one challenge is if you're in the company of those with uber-dietary concerns, ie:  soy or gluten free.  The fake meats are in abundant presence in the menu, much like Zen in the Gardens.    Servers are always polite.  Although sometimes the communication barrier is due to their zen-like volume of speech, rather than due to language.    Recommended!"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and only eat out at strictly vegetarian restaurants. This one is by far my favourite.  Great value, great staff and great food. My husband who is a pure carnivore will even eat here (It is the only vegetarian place he actually will eat at).   I have been going there for years and had a baby a year ago and they are so accomodating. they have cute bowls and cups and cutlery for the kiddies and the waitresses have even kept her busy for a little bit to allow us to eat uninterrupted for a few minutes.  The customer service is fantastic. I told them the fried sweet and sour bites I ordered were too hard ( I always order them so I knew that's not how they are supposed to be) and they sent it back and re-made the dish for me without any hassle.  These are the dishes that I absolutley love: The drumsticks, sweet and sour bites, fruit rolls, buns.  Also the price and portions are so reasonable."}
{"text":"AMAZING veggie restaurant!  Always quick service. For me, the best item on the menu is the BBQ Seitan (#E61). It will fool even meat eaters.  If you like this place, the company which owns it King's Vegetarian, makes and/or imports veggie meat and other veggie food. Their shop is in the area, and a few of the dishes you get in this resto are sold their."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Such great food. The barbecue buns, enoki mushroom balls, Tom yang fried rice, hot and sour soup, are all delicious. Great service too!"}
{"text":"4 Stars for the food, 1 Star for the Service  Getting right to the point about the service.... -There was no hostess to greet us (which is fine because there usually aren't any at Chinese places) -Stood at the front of the restaurant for 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us... even though at least 4 employees stared at us!  -Ask to move tables because she seated me to face THE WALL, and the lady had the nerve to say \"Excuse Me\" and brushed me off and walk to another customer.  -Took forever to get the bill, to flag any wait staff or get refills (in fact we didn't even get any!) -Service was so bad that I eventually walked to the counter to get the bill and ask for refills myself. Not once, not even twice, but three times.  Overall, that was the worst service I ever received and you could see that other customers were frustrated too. As soon as we sat down, we knew that we just wanted to hurry up and order and get the hell out of there!  Now onto the food. My mom is a vegetarian, and a damn good cook, so I was hoping to surprise her and she was pleased.   -enoki mushroom balls were amazing -bbq pork was very good -har gow and dumpling was DISGUSTING. They put way too much horse radish that I was practically tearing up. In the har gow they put too much bamboo that it was overpowering. They didn't taste anything similar to the real thing at all. -the sushi was ok. -menu was all scambled and confusing. For example it would go from apps, to combos to main entrees, to lunch, to tea, to dinner combos.  -fried rice was good, but way too salty  -portions were small for the price -food was warm, it wasn't sizzling hot or fresh, and you could tell.   Overall I'd never come back here unless it was paid for by someone else and they really wanted me to come."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and so many options. The service is fast and waiters are friendly. The decor is nice and music tasteful."}
{"text":"This was a nice place I stumbled upon while in Mississauga.  Veggie Asian food is my favourite,  I really liked having vegetarian takes on these foods.   I got take out so I can't really comment on the service but everyone seemed friendly.   I had the sweet and sour bites which were almost like small sweet and sour chicken balls.  It was so delicious. I walked back to where I was staying in the rain and I was deeply satisfied with my food when I got home.   The whole Toronto area does a good job with keeping vegetarian options open.   I'd really like to come back again to try some more dishes here and I'd love to try the tea ceremony that this place holds (from what I understood on the posters they have it on certain fridays)"}
{"text":"This is the first asian restaurant (that I know of in the GTA) that cares about the customer experience and caters to all types of food allergies. I am extremely impressed at their customer service! And their food tastes amazing."}
{"text":"I had the best vegetarian dish ever! Took my brother from Vancouver who also owns a Vegetarian restaurant there and he approves!!! Great price for 9 people, we ordered 8 dishes we paid only $120 tax and tips included. That's incredible. Will definitely drive for the quality of food and service!  Highly recommended to try..."}
{"text":"Excellent food for someone who is not a vegetarian and wants meat-alternatives. Terrible customer service though. They got our order wrong and made us pay for it. It could have been caused by the language barrier, I guess and if  that's case, it might be helpful to have someone else answer the phone to take orders because it was very frustrating. We just took it instead because our children were very hungry by the time the order was ready. Other times, we felt cheated on the amount of rice that came with the take-out. The container was almost half empty and it didn't make up for the $2 charge for rice. We would eat here everyday if the service improved because we are thinking of eating less meat in the future."}
{"text":"So where do i begin..we went there for a family dinner and we ordered  6 dishes +dessert. The food was ok nothing out of the ordinary that you would find at a all vegetarian restaurant. Upon receiving the bill, i paid + 7% tip...ONLY as a gesture. The service was not good. The food was not brought out in an orderly fashion and i had to get up a few times to get the attention of our waitress. Next the \"manager\" kept on making \"indian remarks\" and stereotyping when recommending desserts to us. Anyway after i paid the \"manager\" came to my table and told me i paid little tip!!!!!!!!!!!! And he demanded more!!!! I explained to him that tip is based on service and 7% is what i thought was ok.  He said this is canada and you give minimum  15% Lol...really, i am born here i think i would know what the rules are... He told me he came and gave us water so many times and he needs more tip. I gave him another $5 and told him thats it. I am not paying you $20 for shitty service!!!"}
{"text":"I was impressed enough with the food here last week that I ordered it for a meeting of twelve this week.   The meeting was for on a construction site, with architects, engineers and contractors.  Took a big chance with vegan food, but everyone loved it. Everyone except one that is -- the youngest of the bunch. Wouldn't even try it. Snob!  And after lunch, we felt great. Not like the feeling you get after pizza or deli sandwiches.  Thank you Zen Gardens for a great lunch."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing!!! I felt so taken care of that I talked about the lady who served me to all my friends! The food was great and fast and overall, an amazing place to eat. Prices are also reasonable. I also had their magic bar dessert and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Brilliant place for a lunch in the area.   The recommendations are on spot - enoki mushroom balls are delicious.  We had bento boxes (one per person) which were filling and delicious. The food is vegetarian with vegan options which worked very well for my lunch meeting.  The place is well designed, the ambiance is professional and clean, and it's felt pleasant. The service was excellent - attentive, polite and not too overbearing.  FYI the speed of delivery of the food was perfectly fine during lunch hour!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm not a vegetarian, but I LOVE Zen Gardens. Whenever I want to have a \"veggie day\", I would come here. The food is definitely good enough to convince meat eaters to eat with you here without feeling too hipster (not that that's a bad thing really...) Even now, I'm sometimes amazed at how they make the mock meat look so real and taste so good!  What you MUST order (or in my opinion, the best thing on their menu): ENOKI MUSHROOM BALLS. It is this savoury fried crispy thing that is as addicting as chips... so yummy.  Even though it's a franchise, neither the atmosphere or food seems like it. Prices are pretty reasonable, and generally the food is quite good. Bento boxes seem to be popular at this restaurant. Also, they have authentic imported teas in which they sometimes have tea ceremonies...?  If you've never tried a vegetarian restaurant, you should definitely try this place (regardless if you're an omnivore or not)."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for a vegetarian/some vegan options.  We came here on a Sunday night an hour before closing. Which was plenty of time to serve us.   The waiter seemed inexperienced and rushed us to order even though we had ample time. They also asked us if we would switch tables with another family because that family was complaining about a \"draft\" from the door as they were sitting near the entry way. It was really strange that they asked, as if we would be ok with the draft.   We came with some friends that are doing raw vegan for lent, so they ordered salad, salad wraps and lettuce wraps. Two out of three of their items weren't made properly according to their request. They had specifically asked to ensure nothing is cooked, but those details were looked over. Our friends has to pick around their food and send one dish back.   All in all they were not as accommodating probably because they were in a rush to close.   The food here is pretty good, there is a lot of variety. A little too much where it can get confusing. Especially for a non vegetarian.  It's very typical chinese food that you can get at a regular store but with a lot of meat substitutes and vegetable options.   They is also a section for tea. A great collection.   I would come here again, even though we had one bad experience of customer service, but a one off."}
{"text":"It's one of my favorite vegetarian restaurant. If you are sick there soups are the best. Their vegetarian tofu recipes are one of the best. They have variety of reasons in their tea shop."}
{"text":"Yummies ... give it a try!  :)    A group of us ordered:  Spring Rolls Crispy Seitan with Plum Sauce Spicy Veggie Crispy Cutlets Veggie Cutlets with Mango Barbeque Veggie Ball Lo Han Chai Chow Mein Spicy Eggplant  Well, my favourites were the Crispy Seitan with Plum Sauce and the Spicy Veggie Crispy Cutlets (addictive!).    In general, I enjoyed all the dishes.  Had I known of this place, I would have frequented it more often.  Its definitely a wonderful place for those who are looking for yummy vegetarian dining options.  The space is quite nice - modern and clean.    Ample parking.    I had been saving my reciept for yelping purposes and now I can finally throw it out with a clear conscience.    Give it a try!!! :)"}
{"text":"finally.......vegan dimsum, absolute quality. I don't remember everything I ordered and inhaled except for the BBQ \"pork\" bun, and the veggie hargow, and the sticky rice. I went back for dinner SAME DAY and also forget everything I ordered and inhaled. Not a very useful review other than to tell you you'll be hard pressed to find anything you don't like here.....I've not tried absolutely everything but at this rate I doubt I will find anything short of winners."}
{"text":"Dinner at Zen Garden - arrived around 8 pm and the restaurant was almost full. We were seated at a large table even though we were two. The waiter was friendly and all smiles.  The interiors are done well and in some way refer to \"zen\" theme. Although a little too noisy for complete zen.  The menu is comprehensive and it took us some time to narrow down what to eat. Right from dim sum and dumplings to hot pot and all thats in between.  We ordered the pumpkin corn soup. It was thick and creamy. Comfort food for a cold night. Then came the steamed dumplings. It was a little unsettling to the palate to not have meat in the dumplings.  The star of the show was the Enoki mushroom balls. Crisp mushrooms with a ribbon of seaweed around them. Fried and served on a bed of Yu choy greens. All topped of with iced lemon tea. Guilt free good food. Recommend!"}
{"text":"This place had the nicest servers and very patient with me lol. Was highly satisfied with my bento box, I got the spicy Kung Pao version. It came with a salad, spring roll & cutlets, soup, steamed dumplings, and purple rice.would definitely recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"Went to this place for my dad's birthday because recently he's been eating less and less meat. The restaurant is located in a plaza that faces away from the road so if you don't see their sign on the billboard, it could be easy to miss.   First impression of the restaurant was that it was clean and well presented. I smelled tofu the second I walked in (which is fine because this is a vegetarian place so what else can they cook lol). It was also quiet and had a relaxing atmosphere which is contrasting to what you would expect at a typical Chinese/Asian restaurant. Since it was our first time there, we didn't know what to order and but the server was super helpful and recommended a lot of dishes.   Things we ordered: 1. Large Hot and Sour Soup - tasty and it was a lot of soup, was more sour than spicy 8/10  2. BBQ tofu - my favourite dish of the meal! Unlike BBQ Pork, which can sometimes be dry and hard, BBQ Tofu is moist all the way through. Not sure how they made the tofu but it has a consistency similar to meat and had the best flavour. Would definitely recommend. 10/10  3. Three Cup Tofu - this is their take on the Taiwanese dish, Three Cup Chicken. It had two different types of tofu and some mushrooms, was tasty 7/10  4. Enoki mushroom balls - this is one of their main dishes but I personally did not enjoy it. It's pretty much deep fried enoki mushroom balls wrapped with seaweed and placed on top of boiled spinach. I didn't like the taste of deep fried seaweed. Judging from the reviews a lot of people do like it, so give it a try if you're feeling adventurous!   5. Red Bean Cake - typical, like something you can get at any other dim sum place. Not worth the price markup  6. Fried Taro Cake - three generous pieces and actually tastes like taro! (Not filled with flour) would recommend if you like taro cakes  Overall Zen Gardens gets a 3/5 because although they have some hot vegetarian dishes (BBQ Tofu), the prices are marked up too high for their other mediocre dishes."}
{"text":"And by \"Vegetarian Restaurant\" what they really mean is mostly vegan!  Hoorah!    My husband and I dined here last night to celebrate the new year.  I was kind of hoping that they would have some mochi to celebrate, but alas they did not!  Regardless, I had a really great time.    The menu is extensive, maybe 12-15 pages even, and only a handful of those are not vegan.  That is incredible for the Mississauga area.  (Or maybe I'm just not looking hard enough.)   I guess I should tell you that my review might be slightly biased.  (... Or perhaps I'm missing the point of giving you MY OPINION.)  Based on my DINING experience, I feel that Zen Gardens should probably get four stars.  The food was excellent, the service was good, but that extra fifth star comes from the fact that I could browse the entire menu and have almost anything I wanted.  Anything.  I felt so excited just being there.  The seitan was delicious.  I've never been so excited to try mock meats before!    But then you set the dining experience aside, and you realize that Zen Gardens actually has MORE to offer than just a meal.  They offer take-away (with a 10% discount on orders $20 or more) AND they offer an enormous selection of premium grade loose leaf tea.  (I am currently sipping on the Juicy Peach Green Tea as I write this.)  Careful, though, some of these teas cost a shiny penny.  But remember that these are shipped directly from China or Taiwan and they are the real thing, so if you're a tea snob, or you've just come from a visit overseas, it's worth every penny.   Okay, so aside from dining, take-away, and a tea selection- they also do tea ceremonies!  I have yet to experience one so I can't comment too much on that- but the fact that they offer it is fantastic.   So, when you look at the dining experience, the service, the food, the tea, etc, suddenly five stars doesn't seem like enough.   Love Zen Gardens, am super impressed, and will DEFINITELY be returning.   Disclaimer: I've been a vegetarian for the better part of five years and a few months ago my husband and I decided to remove dairy and all other animal protein from our diets, so this whole experience was very new to us.  That being said, I've only ever tried a handful of \"mock meats\", and I'd certainly never had seitan or TVP."}
{"text":"Eating here is a MUST for all vegans and vegetarians. It's not often that we find a menu with so many veggie options! I have been here twice and both times it's been amazing. I deducted one star for service, I won't go into detail since almost every review has mentioned it. The lunch bento box is perfect, good sized portion with nice variety, including the tastiest miso soup I've ever had. We also tried out two buns, curry and barbecue. Huge size and really good. Portions are decent and we had leftover to take with us (which I basically ate when I got home). I have to go back because there are so many items I want to try out!"}
{"text":"Ordered the dinner bento box for lunch. And omg, everything we had was so good. Bento box usually come with soup, dim sum a salad entree and rice.   The dim sum were good with hot sauce. The chicken nugget was interesting but my boyfriend seemed to like em'.  The spring roll was a spring roll. And the entree were so good. I really enjoyed the mushrooms.   My boyfriend had the sweet and sour root vegetable and had the mushrooms that are fried and wrapped in seaweed.    We left feeling satisfied and content. Very tasty place with fast service. Oh! They have a pineapple cookie that is delicious too.  If we lived in Ontario we'd eat here again."}
{"text":"An amazing experience every time. This is a vegetarian and vegan Asian food place. The soy nuggets are bomb and the enoki mushrooms are to die for! Those are usually my staple dishes here and then I usually get a rice or noodle dish with another \"protein\" dish. The waiters are always super nice and no issue with parking here!!!"}
{"text":"Wow it's been awhile! The first restaurant I thought I would review is this one! Just the other day my friend and I were deciding  where to go to eat. Lately I'm trying to watch the food I eat... Lol ok I'm lying but I'm trying to make a better effort to find healthier options. Anyway my friend decided to come here since he's been here before. When I arrived I noticed a sign \"vegetarian restaurant\"... I was a little let down because I really wanted some chicken lol. As I walked in, it was quiet and clean. The atmosphere felt very inviting with the light granite/ dark wood furniture. I decided to go use the washroom and I came across a sign saying \"how to flush the toilet\"... Little things like this, should be fixed.. I don't want to be paranoid using the washroom so I skipped out and decided to wash my hands instead (there was also a sign, \"How to wash hands\".. Like really!?) When I came back to my seat, we were ready to order and decided to grab the miso soup, sweet & sour fritters, BBQ saiten & the california rolls. The waitresses were really nice, soft spoken and +10 points for refilling my water every 10 minutes ... Lately I feel many restaurants are slacking on that h2 the IzzO... It's a big deal for me lol. The food arrived very quickly. First was the miso soup.. Man I feel that I like the vegetarian option over the original because it was less salty. They were not stingy on the tofu pieces either... It was the perfect texture for the soup. As soon as we were half way through the soup, the sweet and sour fritter and the BBQ saiten came out. It was visually appealing, love the little details on the presentation. The fritters were delicious, crunchy and perfectly tossed in the sauce. The BBQ saiten actually looked like meat and I was hella confused but it was so damn good I was actually considering going Vegan... I'm serious! Moments after our California rolls came out and the first one I put in my mouth (sounds so wrong.. I'm not starting this again lol) I was like woah! Very few times I have had sushi melt in my mouth... This place is killing it, in a good way! For dessert we got the magic bar. If you are a fan of brownies, nanaimo bars, then you will love this! The top layer has chocolate chips, second layer has coconut, and last layer looks like chocolate cake or granola.. Didn't really investigate so much but you have to try it, to understand what I mean! When I was leaving the restaurant, I noticed that they have a beautiful section for a tea ceremony. One day I would like to be part of that, when I have the chance. Overall I had a great experience and I have a whole new out look on vegetarian food and will definitely come back here to try more things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! It's so very friendly staff and nice decor. Very popular location so can get noisy at times. Food is amazing and the teas are out of this world!"}
{"text":"There aren't that many Chinese restaurants in Mississauga comparing with Markham/Scarborough, not to mention a vegetarian restaurant. When I found out there is one with some good reviews from yelp, I must give it a try myself. I went with my family on a Tuesday night. Location is at a plaza near Hurontario and Derry where it is a bit out of the core of Mississauga. The restaurant looks trendy, like one of those fusion restaurants. It kinda divides into two sections, where one for dining, the other for tea drinking. They seem to specialize in tea as well.  Come to the foods, some of the dishes name funny if you understand Chinese. We ordered a 6 people combo + fry rice. The portion is big, the price is reasonable. Some of the dishes are little bit in the salty side. Enoki mushrooms ball was interesting and good. It is like seaweed wrapped around mushrooms and fry it. I would recommend it.  Service was the problem that night. Maybe it was a Tuesday night, only one server and one person at the counter, so the service was slow, besides that everything was ok."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegetarian food, the service needs a bit improvement, especially they are very busy!  We ordered stems casserole with XO sauce, tom yang fried rice, three stuffed treasures, black pepper veggie fillet, Peking roast seitan, BBQ seitan, stuffed steam bun.   Casserole, BBQ seitan, stuffed treasures, and stuffed steam bun are 5 out of 5. Stuffed treasure is the best, BBQ seitan close second. Veggie fillet taste very good, but probably wasn't cut by a cook, the size of the pieces were all over the places, so we gave 4.5 out of 5. The fried rice is 4 out 5, taste fine but no surprise. The Peking roast seitan is 2 out of 5, too oily.   Waitress was super nice, but they are under stuffed, expecting long wait while they are busy."}
{"text":"Highly recommend for Vegetarians  My family alway starts off with a soup, any of these are all great choices: Hot & Sour Soup Wonton Soup Tom Yang Vermicelli  These are ordered every time:  Enoki Mushroom Balls - wrapped in seaweed sheets, served on a bed of greens.  It's crispy and very flavourful  Sweet N Sour Bites - Textured vegetable protein with pineapple, mushroom, red and green bell peppers on the side  These are great with either white or purple rice  Still haven't gone through the whole menu, but always looking forward to trying new things.  The atmosphere is quite serene.  Their tea selection is always a great addition to the whole experience"}
{"text":"I am floored, this place has exceeded my expectations. EVERYTHING we ordered off the menu including our tea's tasted flawless. Who knew Vegetarian food could taste so great. I loved it so much Im starting to feel more confident about becoming a Vegetarian lol. I've been sick without an appetite for a week now, but actually found myself coming back for seconds....thirds...and fourths.   We ordered the Vegetable Efu Noodles, The Seitan Platter, Sweet and Sour Fritter Balls, and Udon noodle Soup. I have always been a lover of Seitan, but this place killed it, the flavors were so close to the real thing its insane knowing that its mock. My favorite Seitan would have to be the red one because it literally tastes like Char Sui Meat (BBQ Pork). Dem sweet and sour fritter balls were so on point, I honestly prefer them over the real thing. Might I add, I paid $3.99 for the best tasting Iced Lemon Tea in town.   kk but you have to try this place.."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time yesterday.  The moment you walk in you feel the ambiance.  Its truly a zen-ish.  haha. They even have a small tea section (kinda like a tea shop you find in a mall)  I took my mom here for mothers day.  They serve regular food dishes + rice as well as hotpot!  The food is SOOO good.  The \"fake meat\" tasted soooo good and it didn't leave that groggy, tired, greasy, feeling you normally get when you eat real fried meat.  My favourite dish had to be the fake BBQ pork you would normally get at a Chinese restaurant.  There are lots of things for me to try still.  Other vegetarian places usually have very expensive vegetarian food and I thought this place was pretty good in terms of pricing.  I give it 5 stars.  Points for originality. Points for taste.  Points for pricing. Points for service."}
{"text":"Sometimes it can be difficult to travel when you are a vegetarian or a vegan. This restaurant made my trip to Toronto even better.  I found this place by looking for vegetarian and vegan fare here on yelp and I am so glad that i gave it a try.    For starters, the restaurant was very clean. All of the tables were immediately cleaned off when someone left.  It made me feel like I could relax at our table knowing that it was clean.    Second, the service was great.  I thought it was a little strange that we did not have just one server, we had around 3 or 4.  All of the servers worked together to take our orders, refill our glasses, and bring us our food.    Third, I am an avid tea drinker and I was very impressed with their tea selection as well as their presentation of the tea.  You can order a pot of tea (which gets refilled) for only 5 bucks.  I shared a pot of green jasmine tea with someone and we actually ended up drinking 2 pots.   Lastly, the food was amazing! There were so many different options on the menu that it was almost overwhelming to choose just one or two things.  The portions are very large so you definitely get your moneys worth.   Overall I really do not have any complaints with this restaurant.  If you are in the area I would definitely give it a try (even if you are a meat eater)."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant because I'm a vegetarian. My table ordered the enoki mushroom balls and the eggplant (both as bento box meals). The bento box meals come with soup, dim sum and the meal which included two nuggets, a spring roll, salad and purple rice. We had hot and sour soup which was delicious and I especially enjoyed the nuggets! The mushroom balls were delicious (my boyfriend really liked them) but the eggplant was a bit underwhelming (still tasted good though).  Staff was nice and courteous. Probably won't come here again, but it was a good first experience! I recommend this place for those wanting to try something new and for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Haven for vegans and vegetarians. Had the Setian pork and Kung pow lunch special and couldn't stop eating. Such a treat since I have limited options as a vegan. Service is good and environment is peaceful. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Three stars for good food. Service is below par. Inspite of so many bad reviews on services, they don't understand that their customer services is not right. We booked a table for 14. Our initial impression was that they understand our requirements and they will do a good job. However, when we reached there, the table had 10 chairs and 10 plates. We had to go back and forth to make every one to accommodate on table for 10. That was a big negative for me as it ruins the fun. We ordered a few appetizers and they brought 3 at a time. Just imagine 14 people and 6 pieces with no dips. another minus in the service. Then we asked them to bring all the main course together, Which they did. Appetizers tasted ok but entrées were good. They charge extra if you ask them an empty cup for the tea.  In such a competitive market, these guys need to  grow up, stop giving excuses and be accountable.  May be Chinese culture is different than North American but guys you are in NA. We like your food and want to eat more often than one time."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian this place is manna from heaven. Being part Chinese I get all the dishes that are usually meat based in veggie form.  I come back all the time since I work close by. Recommend the rice noodle w fake black bean sauce beef and the teriyaki cutlets."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but I definitely enjoyed the dishes we had ordered.  I really enjoyed the hot and sour soup. The sweet and sour \"chicken\" seems to look identical with the real kind.  The rest of dishes was definitely pretty good. No complaint. But the down fall is some of us wanted soda or pops, they dont serve those drinks. The restaurant believe in keeping it healthy. So instead they serve tea but will charge you 5 bucks for a tiny pot with 4 tiny tea cups. If you needed more cups that additional 50cent each."}
{"text":"Very great customer service very sweet! Great food... excellent dishes for vegans and vegetarians love the variety and the flavour is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I love to experiment...with food.  So I decided to try the vegetarian Chinese food.  My previous experience with Chinese vegetarian food (about 15 years ago) was not bad and great taste, but it was so full of MSG, I drank so much water.  This place was a completely different experience.  A nice simple but elegant setting, the restaurant lives up to its name as it feels like complete zen in here.  Also, I didn't detect a hint of MSG and felt like homemade.    I ordered a spicy eggplant dinner combo (available at lunch time), which basically comes with miso soup, mock dim sum (har gow and siu mai) and a bento box featuring the eggplant.  Miso soup - this was the most amazing miso soup I've ever had.  Not too salty and lots of tofu.  Real natural taste.  Probably the way the Japanese intended.    Har Gow and siu mai - Props to the chef because the presentation and imagery of this was just like real dim sum.  Pretty good and for the siu mai, I couldn't even tell it was vegetarian.    Spicy eggplant bento box (with purple rice, salad, spring roll and soy nuggets) - they really did make eggplant the star of this box.  There was so much (at least 20-25 slices) and the flavour was great.  The only minor improvement I would ask for is for it to be more spicy.  The purple rice was delicious and had a nice crunchy texture, which was different but good and the salad was awesome. The vegetables were very fresh.  The soy nuggets and spring roll was average.  In summary:  Why come here:You want good Chinese food without msg and without asking your mom to cook for you.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I think this was one of the better Chinese meals eating out.    Why you shouldn't come here: You want cheap, greasy Chinese food or Americanized Chinese food  Final verdict:  Check it out.  Worth a try even if you are not vegetarian."}
{"text":"amazing food, good service, won't disappoint (the sweet and sour bites and rice noodles with tvp are my personal favourites and I order them each time I go there, 69/10 recommend)"}
{"text":"I came here for Chinese New Year with my family and because my mom loves this place and always chooses to go here when it's her turn to choose.   The place was busy but we had reservation but still had to wait about 10-15 minutes until we were seated.   We opted for the Chinese New Year set menu which was $92 for a small group. I have absolutely no idea what was on this menu but I was ready to be surprised! We got a side order of the hot and sour soup which was extremely sour which I liked but my brother in law did not. We got a platter for appetizer that was filled with 5 things, the \"calamari\" was a hit with my nephews. I believe they used bean curd for the bbq pork which I ended up eating all myself.   The rest of the dish came out and I honestly do not know what I ate but I just ate it with no questions. There was two dishes that stood out the most to me - the enoki mushroom balls and the \"sweet and sour pork\". My nephews are young so at times they can be picky with their food and they're both not the biggest fans of vegetables but we managed to trick them into this meal and they completely loved it! The enoki mushroom balls scared them at first because of the sauce but after a little convincing they tried it and wouldn't stop after! I personally enjoyed it too because it was crunchy and delicious. What blew my mind the most was the remake of sweet and sour \"pork\", the pieces are all battered and fried and covered in a sauce. I kept eating it and trying to figure out what the fried part was and ended up just asking one of the workers and they told me it was eggplant!! I was in such awe that they were able to pull this off because my nephews thought it was pork the whole time too.   I didn't pay attention much to the menu only because I wanted to be surprised by how they're able to make certain dishes completely out of vegetables.   Side note: tea is $4.99 a pot, which my mom wasn't too happy about.   Overall, really great experience. Would return again!"}
{"text":"This place is too good to be true.  A true gem of a restaurant in Mississauga.  We just ate here today, and loved it.  Service was top notch and food was indescribable.  Ok, I will try: creative, tasty, great presentation, and healthy.  This is my favorite restaurant in Mississauga now.    I cannot praise this restaurant enough.  Everything about this place was put together with a positive and warm intention of providing incredible food with care.  Whoever the owner of the restaurant is deserves recognition.  BB Lee."}
{"text":"I like the food here most of the time. Depends what you are getting and when you're going.   The service is hard... many of their staff only speak mandarin. We called a month in advance to book a table for CNY cause it's busy, after being passed around to 2 ppl speaking 3 languages they said okay but you need to call back 2 weeks before the date or we'll cancel the reservations.   Shouldn't the restaurant be calling us to confirm? I called back two weeks prior, they passed me around again and then a man comes on the line and says why are you calling us back if you already have a reservation???  Day of we order, a server comes out and confirms our order, without really listening he walks away. Our order wasn't put in then it was wrong and he came out to ask us about the sweet and sour dish we ordered and then instead of bringing us the last 3 we were missing, he brought us 3 sweet and sours and charged us for all 3...  difficult...will only come here when I need to."}
{"text":"I have been here before for the sushi, and it was good.  Today I ventured out and tried some dim sum items.  My fault for ordering then coming to the realization this is a vegan restaurant.  Instead of BBQ pork buns - the 'BBQ buns' were full of vegetables.  Not bad.   But sui mai with what I think was mushroom.  Not so bueno.  The girl caught me wrinkling my nose after I had my first bite.   Check please!!   I will stick to the sushi from now on.  Open and modern decor.   Friendly service.  Even invited me to a ceremonial tea tasting.  Sort of intriguing if you like that kinda thang.....(which I might!) LOL"}
{"text":"Great food. Clean and nice ambience. Love the menu selection. The appetizers are the best in town."}
{"text":"Great selection of tasty, vegetarian food! Low prices, too. Decent atmosphere - not too casual."}
{"text":"Great food! Everything tastes like how it would if it weren't vegetarian, but the plus is, that it is vegetarian and we walk away healthier with clean good food in our stomachs! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I must first say I am not a vegetarian but I have family members who are.  We come here pretty often with family.  This place is absolutely amazing!  You won't even miss eating meat!  The food is great and they put so much detail into making the dishes look like real meat.  The shrimp even has small veins to make it look real.  Their \"BBQ pork\" is so good, we always order this.  I really enjoyed their lemongrass fried rice as well.  I would say they are a bit more expensive than a regular Chinese restaurant but this is because they specialize in vegetarian food that looks like meat.  Highly recommend!  It is also great for Buddhist vegetarians who have a strict no meat, onions, garlic, etc diet."}
{"text":"In all honesty, we take out from this place at least once a month! I've practically tried everything on the menu and have liked each and every single one of them. If I were to recommend anything, it would be the Enoki Mushroom Balls, BBQ Seitan and Pumpkin Corn Soup. oh yeah and the Curry Vermicelli (Singapore noodles)    p.s. If you've ever been to King's Cafe on Augusta in Kengsinton market it is the same restaurant. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian food and everything that isn't vegan is labeled! Shared the BBQ Seitan, Sushi Platter and Fried Noodles with 2 other people and left full and happy. Nice staff, great atmosphere. No complaints."}
{"text":"Vegan friendly, and 100% vegetarian! Almost the entire menu is vegan, and they make it clear which options are not vegan by marking whether it has dairy or eggs. Food was good and the mains are a large portion - enough for two people. The apps were good as well, some a little too pricey for what you got (I.e. soy nuggets) but they were tasty. The main was tasty too, had a tofu dish, however take note they use soft silken tofu instead of firm (in case you have a preference). This is a Chinese standar though. Fried banana was yummy and came with two pieces which was nice. Prices are fair for most of the stuff. Service was amazing, we had a guy who had the entire menu memorized by the numbers, not sure if all the servers are like this but we were impressed. Also he was very friendly. Would be back and would recommend."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been here many times since I discovered it a while back, and I keep returning.   The thing I love the most about this place are the soups! They are huge and just plain delicious! I've tried about 3 or 4 now and have yet to be disappointed!   The atmosphere is awesome as it's very quiet and relaxing.   I recommend trying any of their smoothies as well.   Great options for vegans and vegetarians a like and you won't be let down by the flavours.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought Asian vegetarian would be so good.  You almost forget that there is absolutely no meat to eat here!    Definitely worth coming back."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Nothing great. I've had better. Ordered take out 2 times and both times didn't come with cutlery. Didn't know we had to eat wonton soup without a spoon. The noodles were soggy in the centre of the bowl but the edges were still raw. Clearly were not fried noodles. Don't think I'll return"}
{"text":"We regularly frequent King's Cafe in toronto and read their name on the back side of paper menu there and thought hmmmm there is a way to get my hands on that veggie soy kung pao chicken and divine dumplings without having to drive for 35 minutes and find parking?? YES!  The menu is exactly the same - and we in typical fashion mostly order the same food. The dumplings are the best (I like them more than Mothers' Dumplings yes I said it!) and not to mention the skewers, the won ton soup (which I never got to try as it always contains pork until here!) and so are the chowmein - noodles and the duck.  I dragged my I-eat-anything brother here with my husband and mom (all 3 of us vegetarians) and his exact comment was \"if this is vegetarian, sign me up!\" He actually got another order of kung pao chicken to take home.   Next, I need to figure out how and when to fit in enough visits so i can go through the entire menu."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and you can tell lots of love goes in to the cooking. Unfortunately, the service is atrocious and on the three occasions that I have been here, I've had to wait considerable amounts of times for my food, and even water. My recent visit, I waited half an hour for water and that too, needed to actually raise my hand (and then voice) to be noticed by someone. For that quality of poor service, I did not feel like tipping on that last visit, something which I normally do. What made it more awkward was the person who cashed us out kept asking for a tip, despite a service fee already being charged to us. The audacity, after ignoring us all evening! Needless to say, we walked out. Of course, we walked out after paying - but not tipping, because the service did not warrant it and further begging for it after only turned us off more. Probably won't come back...embarrassing enough that I brought guests here and subjected them to that awkwardness. It's a shame because the food is actually good."}
{"text":"I have had vegetarian dim sum at Graceful Vegetarian in Markham many times, so I couldn't help but compare Zen Garden against Graceful Vegetarian.  Why do I compare the two?  This is because 1) both are Chinese vegetarian restaurants and 2) Graceful is my favourite and, in my opinion, cooks the best Chinese vegetarian cuisine in the east end.   We ordered 3 dim sums and 1 fried rice during a lunch visit.  Dim sums:  When compared to Graceful Vegetarian, the dim sum selection at Zen Garden is quite limited.  But what they do have, they do them well.  All three dim sums were well made.  They looked like their meaty counterparts.  They were tasty.  They average $3 an order, so they are not outrageously expensive.    Fried Rice:  When compared to Graceful Vegetarian, the fried rice at Zen Garden is more flavourful.  Zen's fried rice was tasty; the rice did not stick together and the colour looked good.  The portion was good for 2 to 3 people.  While Zen Garden offers a rather limited selection of dim sum, it offers vegetarian sushi that is not offered at Graceful Vegetarian.  The interior decoration is beautiful here, definitely more contemporary than Graceful.  It is as if Graceful looks traditional Chinese and Zen looks contemporary Chinese.  I can attest that the decoration is tasteful at both restaurants.    The services at Zen is polite and quick.  It is better than Graceful's as the waiters there could be arrogant at times.   I know as a fact that Graceful Vegetarian can do banquets.  I am not sure Zen can carry a banquet based on the menu posted online.  May someone else attest this?"}
{"text":"Yuck Gardens......nothing Zen about this place!  We found hair in the food, and they were so RUDE about us asking for the items to be taken off the bill....but instead they told us that since we ate half the food and then found the hair....they can only give us 5% off....Really....after going back and forth and with no manager on site....they finally agreed to 10% at which point we just wanted to leave ....when they brought the bill to us and lucky we looked at the bill before we paid....we noticed that 3 items were marked up from what was on the menu.  So they gave us 10%, but they marked up 3 items on the bill.....and when we questioned about it .....they made one excuse after another and nothing about what they said made sense!!!.....never have we ever in all the years we have been dining out have we ever dealt with such RUDE RUDE RUDE people and horrible customer service.  If you want to eat hair and pay full price and then pay extra for it....go and enjoy....YUCK RUDE GARDEN."}
{"text":"Wow! Coming from a dedicated carnivore, who knew vegetarian food could be so tasty and delicious? We arrived right at 11:30 AM on a Saturday, and the place was filling up.   First, the ambiance. This place made me feel like I was relaxing in a quiet garden somewhere. Classical musical is played above you, and the atmosphere is very calming.  Second, the food. We ordered a) the Sweet and Sour Lappa (root of a plant) bento box ($11.99), b) the Kung Po Soy Fritters bento box ($11.99), c) a Zen's Hot Milk Tea ($2.99), and d) an appetizer sized portion of the Soy Drumsticks ($5.50). Our bento boxes were delicious - the \"meat\" was simulated to look, feel, and taste like meat. The soy nuggets in our bento boxes could have been McDonald's nuggets and I wouldn't have known the difference if I hadn't been closely looking at the texture. The Kung Po Soy Fritter dish was the standout for us and was so savoury, tasty and flavourful. The Sweet and Sour Lappa was also a wonderful surprise, and coupled with the purple rice, it was a very satisfying meal.  Third, the service. Unfortunately, it can be very, very slow even if it isn't busy. It took about 45 minutes for our appetizer-sized soy \"chicken\" drumsticks to come out, and unfortunately, it came out at the very end of our meal so we didn't get a chance to enjoy it before our bento-box induced comas kicked in. Also, my hot milk tea came right in the middle of our meal after we began eating our bento boxes, not at the beginning while we waited for our food (which was about 20-25 minutes). Our items came out in a really random order, and service seemed a little confused and disorganized.  Note that, as an aside, I think an important consideration to remember is that vegetarian food doesn't automatically equate healthy or calorie conscious meals. This stuff is still packed with oil, sweetness, and some items are still deep fried. Our dumpling soup, for example, had a pool of oil in it, more than I've seen at other restaurants.   Overall, regardless, the food is still unequivocally delicious despite minor quibbles.  For tastiness, we'd definitely come back. For two, people, with tax and tip, we paid about $41."}
{"text":"Decent prices for good food. Dishes are well put together and thought out with some level of creativity/ingenuity. Much better than some lesser veggie restos where everything looks the same and tastes the same, laced with some form of greasy or sweet-sour sauce over everything. I actually prefer this location over King's cafe down at Kensington market."}
{"text":"Service was bad and was told food was cooked from frozen.  We ended up walking out after ordering a tea, we basically cancelled our food order."}
{"text":"AMAZING Japanese style restaurant with some of the best vegan Japanese food I've ever had. I love to come here to treat myself as the bill can be a little pricey at the end of your meal, but it's worth it! My favourite dish is the fried mushroom balls- they are to die for. HIGHLY recommend this place. Even my meat eating partner loves to come here!"}
{"text":"The only reason I came here because my friends were vegetarian and they wanted to try this place. I loved the food. They have a lot of variety. And the service is amazing the staff working that day was very friendly. The set up was very elegant. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"omg. what is in their soy nuggets? they taste almost exactly like chicken nuggets!! We ordered two lunch combos and the seitan platter, which was more than enough food for two people. everything looked clean and appetizing. the staff was very attentive and the decor of the place reflects every bit of being zen. next time I want to try one of their tea cleansers"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian / vegan and I really like this place! Prices are moderate, portions are large and food is great.  Def try:  - Hot and Sour soup - Veg Fried Rice - Eggplant - sesame dimsum  No soda pop available here."}
{"text":"I brought my friends with me on my current visit. It is amazing. The servers are nice and friendly. The place is tidy and neat. I almost forgot this is a vegetarian restaurant. Everyone love the store, would definitely going back again soon."}
{"text":"The vegetarian dishes that look and feel like meat...I don't understand the concept. Do vegetarians want their food to taste and feel like animal? That being said it was quite delicious, and one of the better more outrageous veggie restaurants around. I will come back for more."}
{"text":"You have to visit at least once.  Won't be your last.  Food is amazing, with a wide variety of faux meatless meats, and dishes to please any pallet.  Super friendly and helpful service especially if you have a dozen questions about what to get.  Glad its so close by my crib! You'll leave full with a new discovery of what great tasting veg food can be like. Super dope spot!"}
{"text":"4.5*  This place has been bookmarked for quite some time, but I just had the op to visit it, and it's GREAT!  Initially, I was seated inside the 'Tea' section, but asked to be moved when an available table came up.  The 2 tables that were set up in the 'Tea' section were just too make shift, dark, and separate from the rest of the restaurant.  Getting service there would've been difficult 'cause it's behind a divider.  Highlights of all that was ordered (pictured): -  Enoki Mushroom Balls - which were more like mini wraps, soo yummy!  The \"balls\" themselves were wrapped in seaweed and deep fried -  Pan-fried Green Tea Cake - more mochi, love the flavour of the green tea filling -  Asst. Seitan Platter - I've had this before, but it's a good dish since there are different flavours in 1 dish, bbq, sweet 'n sour, curry, etc. -  Zen Garden Milk Green Tea - also very good.  Tasted like the \"Milk Green Tea\", sans bubbles, that you'd order, but better!  It did come out warm and slightly too sweet, so you hafta wait 'til some of the ice melts  I could've done without the Har-Gow, Sao Mai, Dumplings.  They were good, but the filling themselves were just too \"loose\".  Not as firm as they would be with pork, shrimp, etc.  Still good though, but I just wouldn't order them next time.  I wanted to order the Coloured Crystal Balls, from the Dim Sum menu, but they were out, so next time!  I wished that they had more photos on their menu.  It's more helpful if you read Chinese, but there are parts of the menu which aren't descriptive at all, re:  Dim Sum.  If you like Dim Sum, but not necessarily the MSG-coma, check this place out!  It's somewhat near the airport.  Service was nice 'n calm, not crazy/rude/rough/rushed like usual Chinese places."}
{"text":"I thought the menu looked familiar! This place is one of King Cafe's sister restaurants (KC is in Kensington Market).   My grandmother is a vegetarian so it's my job to scout for the good veggie places and Zen had good reviews so I figured I'd give it a shot. My family ordered my fave from KC, the deep friend seaweed wrapped Enoki (E43 $14.99), Teriyaki Cutlet (E44), and a plated vegetarian noodle dish, bamboo soup, and imitation duck. Unfortunately I don't remember what the last 3 dishes are actually called so that's just my description of them :(   E43 and E44 were good, but you will definitely want some tea and rice on the side because they were too salty for me. I think KC makes the enoki wraps better, and perfectly balanced. My cousin really enjoyed the Teriyaki Cutlet. Some of it was crispy on the outside, while some pieces were softer. The noodles were great and my favourite dish as it was well balanced salt wise, and had a variety of vegetables inside while maintaining the seasoning throughout. The soup was also a welcome dish. As for the duck imitation, my family loved it, but it was my least favourite dish because it was too sweet.   Washrooms are single stall, very clean, and pretty accesible. Service was very attentive throughout our visit. To feed a family of 5, and for some unfinished takeout food that could feed 1 whole other person, our 5 dishes came to almost $80 after taxes. Great prices for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"I first discovered the sister company to this one in Kensington market (King's Cafe).  My wife is vegan, so it's never easy finding a spot for her to eat. But, King's Cafe was fantastic.  When I realized Zen Garden was exactly the same but only a 5 minute drive from where I work I was so excited.  Since then, I've been coming here almost daily for lunch takeout.  I've tried almost all of their lunch combo meals and not only is it super filling, but it's so well priced.  For those that want healthy food, vegan food, fantastic homemade iced tea and other great stuff at a fantastic price - you have to check this place out!  Plus, the energy and staff here are so peaceful."}
{"text":"Came to this place by chance with a group of vegetarians. I had low expectations coming in (since I'm a meat eater) but the dimsum was much better than expected. We had the sweet/sour soup which had a nice zing to it - the large size was big enough for all 5 of us). We had one the buns which was also good and the dumpling which tasted great with the sauce. Service was good - plenty of seating with good decor."}
{"text":"Great place for vegetarians.  It took a lot of convincing and really had to drag some meat-tarians with me, and surprise, surprise, they LOVED it! We ordered a beef dish and it taste almost like the real thing.   Previously, we have been for dim sum. It was a little pricey than normal and they opened a little later than I expected. But boy oh boy, it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have been to Zen Gardens a handful of times. I originally found this restaurant when I was trying to find vegetarian eateries for two colleagues from India who were helping my group out for a few months. We never went because they craved food from their homeland.   I actually visited this place with our team months later. We have a vegetarian on our team. A few months after that, I came here with my manager.   The food here is incredibly tasty. You don't even realize that you are not eating any meat.   I have had the following delicious items:  - Sweet and sour lappa (fake chicken nuggets, salad, and purple rice, and sweet and sour lappa) - Iced lemon green tea - Cutlet bento box - Har gow - Siu mai  I love the sweet and sour lappa. Yum! It tastes like sweet and sour chicken. The purple rice is wonderful. Then again, I practically like anything purple. Naturally, I need salad. I feel odd without it.   I have also tried the cutlet bento box. It is yummy, too.   The iced lemon tea is exceptionally fragrant and refreshing. I was impressed. The har gow and siu mai dim sum items tasted authentic. Again, I didn't feel the void of meat. Everything was filling.   As a tea freak, I was pleased to see a tea room at this restaurant. You can buy loose leaf tea here. There is a ton of variety.   There is a decent number of parking spots in this small plaza. I have never had any issues finding a spot.   I was hoping to return here for a colleague's birthday. Sadly, that didn't pan out. So, I'll need to make another determined effort to get out here soon. I miss the food.   (91)"}
{"text":"Pros: friendly and helpful service, attentive wait staff, beautiful decor, quiet location  Cons: I didnt find the food particularly tasty. Going at lunch takes about 1hr to get your food.  They recommended ordering ahead so it will be ready when you arrive."}
{"text":"Lunch specials until 3 was a good way to try their dishes. Had the enoki mushroom balls lunch, sweet and sour lapah lunch, Har gow and siu mai dim sum. First time here and seems like a great selection of food.   Found out from the menu it sources the vegetarian ingredients from a place we buy as well. I think even meat lovers would find this place acceptable. Not that cheap but reasonable. Will come back for the hot pot and Peking duck.   Give this place a try if you are in the area. Probably better vegetarian chinese food compared to Markham / Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I was charged $9.50 for a bowl of mixed veg rice and $9 for 10 small soy nuggets? That is stupid. Then they wouldnt let us sit to eat because it was almost closing 9pm yet there were two families enjoying their meal at the table slowly, and they continued to bring them food? The tea is expensive about $5 a cup, on each table there are electric heat pads for your tea. Tea is obviously important here. Then I was ripped off by paying U.S Dollar and it took 3 people to figure out my bill. This place sucks."}
{"text":"A really good vegetarian restaurant in Mississauga! I definitely recommend if you are a vegetarian, or if you are just looking for some delicious non-meat alternative!!   Service can be a hit and miss due to the wait time. Some days wait time is fantastic and food arrives in a timely manner, and other times you may get frustrated because your food is taking way too long to come out. I ordered take-out over the phone recently and I had to wait an additional 25 minutes when I got to the restaurant. There weren't even too many tables when I got there - only about 3 or 4 max. There may be a language barrier sometimes, I noticed the older ladies typically don't speak english but the younger servers often do!  Food is extremely good! I always order the hot and sour soup - it is my FAVOURITE place to get this soup! I highly recommend it for a small appetizer with your meal. So far on their menu, I've tried their rice noodles with textured protein, lo han chai chow mein and tofu casserole. All EVERY good! My boyfriend is a heavy meat eater and was surprised by how good all the vegetarian dish I bought him were.   The portions are fairly huge depending on what you order. The soup and noodles have big portions and well worth the price. I believe a small soup is $4.99 and the fried noodles range from $9.99 to $12.99. All of these were good to share between two people, and we even had plenty of noodles left over. The tofu casserole is probably my favourite dish but sadly I don't find that the quantity for this matches the price. It is the most expensive at $13.99, and I expected a lot more given the price that I paid. However I'd still continue buying it because it is so good! LOL  I highly recommend this place if you are ever craving vegetarian food or just want to try something new and delicious!!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place recently and I've been back at least 3 times now. The service is quiet but very smooth and efficient. The vegetables are plentiful, great variety, and fresh. The tofu and soy have a nice texture to them. The tofu is soft and the soy has a nice soft spring to them. There's no awful rubber feeling you get at some places. Soy nuggets are addictively delicious. You cannot tell it's soy and they're fried perfectly crisp without the heavy oily feeling.  I've had the bento box 3 times and each one has been so tasty. It comes with a clean tasting and refreshing miso soup with nice chunks of silken tofu and seaweed. It's not overly salted and doesn't seem to have any MSG in it. They boxes come with 2 soy nuggets that are so crispy and juicy. It also has a side salad that has a lot of veggie variety and a nice light miso vinegarette. The wild/brown/red rice mixture is a nice change from the usual white rice. I've had the enoki mushroom flash fried in seaweed (amazing), eggplant (so delicious), and the spicy kung pao (right amount of spice with great amount of veggies). All of it has been so tasty and leaves me wanting me to come back each time.   The food arrives quickly and though it is a bit on the expensive side for a lunch, it's completely worth it!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I'm not vegetarian lol. But I've been here twice and I really loved it both times! There are a lot of options to try, and if you're in a group, there are also useful \"pre-set\" meals to order from so you can try 6+ dishes. That's the best way to do it, I think, so you'd get to try a little bit of everything. It also kinda tricks your mind since some of the food looks like meat, even though it's all vegetarian. There's also a tea-shop within."}
{"text":"I've always liked vegetarian food but this place made me fall in love. The mock meals look and taste amazing. They try to make it as close as possible and they do a great job at it. You can tell they put a lot of care in the meals. I ordered the sweet and sour balls bento box meal. Meals come with brown rice (another healthy bonus). I was slightly insulted they included a spoon with my meal because I am Asian and I can use chopsticks very damn well but it seems like they do that with all meals in the box. Got the mock chicken drumsticks as well (one of my favorites). This doesn't really taste like chicken in my opinion but it has a nice texture and is quite flavourful. Tea comes in fancy teapots.   Extensive menu with very friendly staff to answer any questions you may have. You don't need to be a vegetarian to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Nicely decorated. Polite servers too. Love that it's all vegetarian and mostly vegan. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this restaurant. My first was for New Years dinner 2 years ago. During this dinner the restaurant was almost empty (2 tables occupied), which was pretty surprising and made me assume that it wasn't very good. But since it was empty we received great service and for an all vegetarian restaurant the food was really tasty. I really appreciated that they made some huge substitutions to my order without any objections. My brother and I both got the bento box dinner, which came with purple rice, 2 dim sums, a spring roll, miso soup, a fritter, and the curry. What I particularly liked about the food was that for asian cuisine the food wasn't greasy and drenched in oil, which is rare.  I also loved that they tried to make all sorts of fake meat options, such as chicken drumsticks.  However, we totally forgot about this place and didn't visit again until recently. On this recent visit we just made it on time to get the last available table. Shockingly the restaurant was packed! I ordered the same thing as my last visit (bento box with eggplant curry) since I liked it a lot. My brother got the mushrooms. But this time I tried making the same substitutions as last time and it turned out be a bit of a hassle, whereby they said they cannot do it. I had to explain to them that during my last visit there was no problem, so finally they agreed. The food tasted awesome, but my only complaint is that my food came much earlier than my brothers, whom ordered an appetizer (chicken drumsticks) and a main, and both of which came when I was half way done. The review for the fake chicken was that \"it was ok...not that great\", but the mushrooms were amazing. Other than that, the prices are reasonable, portion size was good, decor/ambience was great, service was as fast and efficient as they could considering the rush. So if you're looking for some good but different kind of vegetarian asian food I would definitely recommend Zen, but would suggest to make a reservation if you're planning on going during a peak time/day."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a vegetarian place that makes you say \"Wow, I can't believe this has no meat in it!\" this is definitely not the place. If you're looking for a vegetarian place that sells good vegetarian food that tastes like it's vegetarian, this place is pretty good.  We started with some Crispy Soy Fritters. They're a springy kind of fritter that despite having an odd consistency that's a bit like a dense sponge, taste pretty good.  The Fried Radish Pastry was good, but typical of any dim sum place. Nothing particularly appealing about this dish but it was good.  The best dish of the visit was the Enoki Mushroom Balls. Addictively delicious. Crispy and full of flavor. These were absolutely BOMB. Get these for sure, every time.  Schezuan Style Spicy Tofu was good... but it reminded me of mapo tofu without the meat. I was hoping it would have more oomph but it fell flat.  Lemon Grass Fried Rice was yummy. A little boring but well seasoned and good flavors.  Overall the experience was alright. Nothing to phone home about, but decent food. Service is quiet and accommodating."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend not knowing that this was a vegan place. Now I am person who likes her veggies as much as the meat. We loved all the items and honestly did not miss the meat.  These guys know what they are doing. All the items that we ordered tasted good. The sauce was super flavourful. I like that the menu offered a variety of different options including sushi."}
{"text":"We love the ambience and the fact that it is a completely vegetarian menu.   We usually try the hot and sour & miso soups, which are very good. We also have tried the vegetable fried rice and Lo Han Chai (mixed vegetables).   The service is very efficient and lots of parking outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"It was rly quiet on the day my friends and I went. Would be 4/5 but it didn't feel like they had AC on that day and it was HOT.  The space is nice, looks new. We were curious about this vegetarian place and were quite pleasantly surprised. This is the first chinese restaurant where I actually didn't see a lot of chinese. There were a lot more Indians, likely due to their dietary restrictions which were fulfilled here.  My first time trying soy nuggets and they were really good! I was quite surprised but they had similar batter as McDonald's chicken nuggets. They were a little dry but the dipping sauce balanced that out. I ordered the enoki mushroom bento box and I loved it. Even my friends stole from mine eventually haha.  The area is a little quiet, so there's plenty of parking available"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I chose to have our New Year's Eve dinner here. We didn't know quite what to expect, but we knew we didn't want to drive into Toronto to have a nice dinner so we took a risk on this place because of the interesting dishes available on their menu. We were thrilled with this restaurant. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming. There were several people dining there with large families and even so, we were able to have a nice private dinner without needing to shout over the other families. The entire menu is filled with vegan dishes. I am gluten free and the waitress was also very knowledgable and they were able to accommodate me without any trouble. We ordered some dim sum to start and the taro roll, also gluten free, was awesome. The flavors were well balanced and the inside was steamy hot while the outside was crisply and perfectly cooked. We then had a soup course. We ordered the house vegetable soup which was probably my least favorite dish of the night. However, it was full of healthy vegetables that were cooked just right ( sometimes vegetables get overlooked in such soups). The broth was kind of bland, but overall a very clean and healthy soup. For our entrees, we ordered the ginger cutles, against better judgement, and the spicy eggplant. Both dishes were full of amazing flavor, but I have to say that. I enjoyed the cutlets the best. I don't tend to like dishes that pretend to be a meat dish, however, the flavor of this dish was incredible and it came with a side of fresh finely shredded ginger surrounded by freshly steamed broccoli. The eggplant was also terrific. Large chunks of eggplant were stir fried to perfection and served in a tasty sauce.   This restaurant has an extensive tea menu and the wait staff is very concerned that you pick out the tea that best serves your purpose. At the end of the meal, we ordered the longevity tea and it was steeped at just the right temperature for full flavor. We had such a nice time that we decided to try their dessert menu. While they only had on gluten free option, it was a delicious date and almond bar that does not disappoint.  I would definitely encourage all vegetarian and vegans to give this place a try. The menu is quite affordable and the food is simply delicious. I also think meat eaters would do well at this restaurant if they are open to trying to new things. This location is a bit off the beaten path, but worth the trek. Their teas are available for sale next door in the tea shop. Apparently they do tea ceremonies as well. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am definitely not a vegetarian because I love eating meat but this place is fantastic! This was the first time that I've dined here and I would probably never visit this place if my family friends didn't choose this place to eat at.  The imitation meat actually tastes good and not \"fake\" compared to other vegetarian places I've been to...like the Lotus Garden in Toronto. The food came pretty quick and it was always hot and some were even sizzling. The servers were pleasant and came by several times to refill our glasses with water. I'm not sure if the prices here are affordable or not because I didn't get a chance to look at the menu but according to previous reviews, it sounds a bit pricey.  Overall, this place is great if you are looking for a vegetarian restaurant to dine at. The restaurant is very clean and has a modern look to it. I would definitely drop by this place if I ever crave for imitation meat...and it's pretty close to my house too."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before and have always had a great meal. One of the better options for vegetarians who are dining out.  When my family and I got in, it wasn't that busy and we were seated right away. We ordered zen bars, a sushi platter, enoki mushroom balls, BBQ meat, and soup. All were vegetarian and tasty. I wasn't a fan of the soup, it was something my mom could make at home.  All of our food came within 30 minutes, so quick! The waitresses kept checking back to see how our meal was and to refill our waters.  I really recommend this place for a different take on food. I personally love meat but didn't miss it while eating here."}
