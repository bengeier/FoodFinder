{"text":"We were in a late meeting and needed to order lunch for delivery. We called and the woman was super friendly. Ordered the chicken shawerma plate. The chicken and rice had tons of flavor. The garlic sauce is fresh and adds to the flavor without overpowering the chicken flavor. The delivery guy was super sweet!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic find. We were looking for an interesting place to eat and we found it. Family run market and cafe, super friendly and everything is from scratch!!!"}
{"text":"We tried The Olive Tree tonight after many positive reviews from friends. It was so good. My husband had the Gyro plate and spinach pie and I had the #1 veggie plate (hummus, falafel and babaghnooj). My husband had told them it was our anniversary and they brought us some tabbooli salad to share while we waited. We had baklava for dessert. The service was excellent. Overall a great experience-we will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Always great food at a little family owned place. Please support these folks. Nice people and great food."}
{"text":"You skip this place you are missing out. Period. This is not \"fine dining.\" It is simply good, delicious, honest food made by people who take pride in what they offer. It's the kind of place you wouldn't be afraid to drag Anthony Bourdain to.  So go. Say hi. Ask about the food. Start up a conversation. Before you know it you'll be stuffed and glad you walked through the doors."}
{"text":"Better to eat their wonderful food in house.  $5 delivery charge is not cool.  Fresh and flavorful food.  Hummus, tabouli, babagnooj, spinach pie and baklava all excellent.   X-New Yorker"}
{"text":"This beats out Greek Pita (which is right up the street) any day of the week. The gyro meat is flavorful and not dry, the spinach pie is flaky and delicious, and the baklava is AWESOME. The family who owns it are so friendly and nice, it's a pleasure every time we go there. My only regret is that they had been there almost 2 years before I went! Love it!"}
{"text":"BEST FALAFELS EVER!  My parents and I have had falafels all around the world and I think these here are actually the best I've ever had.  They're not just your typical lettuce, falafel, and tahini sauce.  The falafels weren't dry and made fresh to order, there was great flavorful homemade sauces and relishes, and even the salad inside was full of lettuce, tomato, and homemade pickled vegetables.  Amazing!!!  Flavorful, spicy, and an amazing deal - they were huge and only 3.99!  The market has a great selection of Middle Eastern groceries and is very clean.  The owners treat you like you are their personal guests in their house and love to talk to you about the food, culture, and everything else...very sweet people!  It's definitely not the fanciest place but delicious, authentic, flavorful, loving food and this place will definitely become a regular for us!"}
{"text":"Very nice place with authentic Mediterranean food.  The food is served on real plates (not in plastics baskets or paper plates) and I think that's a nice touch and better for the environment.  The owners are very charming and will offer samples if you are unsure about what to order."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find! The food was delicious and plentiful, and the family who owns it was more than friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've had the Falafel sandwich and the lamb and beef gyro.  Both were very tasty.  The environment is great--there is a market attached where you can buy a whole bunch of international groceries.  The staff is wonderful and attentive.  They checked on us a couple times to see if we needed anything while we ate.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is super yummy and authentic and the owners are always there and make you feel very welcome!"}
{"text":"Fellow Yelp reviews are correct. This is very good. My wife had the chicken schwarma and I had the vegetarian plate. Would recommend both."}
{"text":"First off what a nice old man. This place seems to haven't fair share of regulars and I know exactly why.   We both had the gyros and fries with a Mediterranean salad. The lamb was seasoned with nice spices and wasnt fatty or greasy like a lot of places serve. Good spot for some lunch"}
{"text":"I was awakened from my foodie revery of perfectly seasoned babaganooj on home-made bread by an eerie orgasmic humming. I looked up and saw Ken, his eyes glazed over, humming to his glass of iced Turkish coffee, a delight of his own creation. When Tony, the owner (along with his wife Juliette) came over to investigate, he decided he had to have one too.       This took place at Olive Tree Mediterranean Market and Grill in North Phoenix. Unlike most small groceries, Olive Tree is bright, clean and cheerful. The shelves are stocked with fascinating Middle Eastern delights - jars of olives and tahini, an interesting assortment of cheeses, sweet treats that I'd never seen before. You order at the counter    from a good size selection of ethnic dishes, plus a few typical American items. Food is then brought to your table in a sectioned off area.       I had discovered Olive Tree on Restaurant.com. Since we had to order $35 of food from the menu, we ended up with quite an array of dishes. Now that I think of it, the humming started with the above-mentioned baba. This roasted, pureed eggplant concoction is found in most Middle Eastern restaurants, with varying results. It can be very flat tasting if too much tahini (sesame paste) is mixed in, or it may be over-spiced. This baba was beautiful, with all the tastes dancing in our mouths. Julliette makes her own bread to go with it. The texture is very different from pita (even the pita served here was selected with great care), crustier and chewy. A special of the day was stuffed cabbage. About the same size and shape as the stuffed grape leaves (which were delicious), these are lighter and lemony good - a real treat. We shared a combination kebab plate with chicken, kefta, and shish-kebab skewers. This paled in comparison to the other dishes, since the meat was on the dry side. The baklava was quite good, it wasn't soggy with syrup, so the layers of phyllo dough made a satisfyingly crunchy noise.      After lunch we did a little shopping. We got some delicious feta cheese and something called Chicago cheese, which reminded me of mozzarella. I could have bought more, but Ken wisely herded me out the door."}
{"text":"I walked over here to get lunch from my hotel.  Very friendly staff. I felt like a regular customer before my first order.  I'm not Greek but really enjoy the food and I think this is some of the best falafel sandwiches and gyros sandwiches I have ever had.  The falafel had a great texture with no bitterness at all.  The gyros sandwich was full of meat seasoned very well with just the right amount of sauce.  I will definitely return whenever I'm in this area.  I look forward to trying their kabobs next time."}
{"text":"Love the food! Always fresh, hot and perfectly cooked! My favorite is the Lamb Kabob!   The owners are great too! They always greet you with a smile and a hello! I will be a customer for as long as I live here!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in a business area where few good restaurants exist. The Jordanian owners are always very nice and friendly. I love both vegetarian platters (mostly because I appreciate the variety of falafel, baba, hummus, and/or spanakopita), but when in a carnivorous mood, the basic gyro platter is also yummy, though nothing out of the ordinary. The grocery part of the store is fantastic if you're a foodie like me, always intrigued by items not found in the megamart. Affordable Mediterranean staples, like tahini, and decent produce prices too (though quality/availability is hit or miss).   Cons: Tabbouli could have more flavor (more lemon, less bulgar, maybe?), service can be slow if you are in a hurry during lunch.   Overall, worth a trip if you're in the mood for something more authentic in this area of suburban, crappy chain restaurants."}
{"text":"The Greek salad is fantastic. Very fresh! We also had the lamb platter which was very tasty."}
{"text":"The best! This review is long overdue but everything about this place is wonderful. The owners Tony and Juliette are incredible and make you feel like family every time you come in! Incredible tabbouli, gyro sandwiches, chicken shawarma, lentil soup, greek salad and hummus! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu - I think by now we've tried it all! Have yet to find another place this good in the valley!"}
{"text":"I could eat here every day! The food is always exceptional. The owners are another big reason to come back often. They remember exactly what I like and are always so pleasant. It's the type of place you can go to order a Jordanian coffee and the owner will make one for himself as well to join you and have a nice conversation while you wait for your food. If you want the real deal and to support a great group of people make this your go to place!"}
{"text":"Great value and authentic food. Always prepared well and tastes great. Awesome lunchtime spot and a pretty good market selection."}
{"text":"I love this place! The owners are super sweet, the food is always delicious! I love the market where you can buy everything you need to make your own hummus or you can buy their deliciously made hummus! So many reasons to try this place if you have not already!"}
{"text":"Cute little place- friendly owner, very accommodating. We have falafel and it was great! Better than most of the stuff I could find in NYC. Can't wait to try the gyros next time."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!!  That was good!  First off, if you're looking for \"atmosphere\", this place probably won't be your cup of tea.  This place really is a \"Mom and Pop\" joint, being run by a very nice Lebanese immigrant couple.  It's in an end cap of a fairly new strip mall.  Inside, it feels like an ethnic Levantine 7-11 that's on it's third or forth paint job with a few tables scattered around for the diners.  BUT THE FOOD!!!  Your mouth literally starts running the second you walk in here!  I had the 3 meat combo-delicious!  My wife had a vegetarian plate and shared with me-perhaps the best falafel, pitas, egg plant dip, tabouli, and humus I've ever had.  The portions are ample; I wish I had room to sample their dolmades or baklava.  Oh well, just an excuse to go back.   The market portion of this establishment sells Eastern Mediterranean groceries; olive oil, couscous, grains, legumes, vegies, seasonings, etc...all higher quality and better priced than you will find at a typical supermarket.    Overall, I can't think of a better place in this area for Mediterranean food.  They really \"put their heart on their plates\"."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here all the time for lunch! The Gyro (Lamb) is absolutely amazing as are the fries!!! The hummus appetizer is delicious and the perfect size! 5 stars every trip!!"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was average and cost a little more than what i thought it was worth. I am a swarma lover and there is much better greek places in the north and northwest valley. The swarma here lacked flavor.  Although this is close to my work next time I feel like Greek food I'll make the longer drive to where the swarma knocks your socks off."}
{"text":"We tried the gyros sandwiches and a hummus plate. Very impressed with every aspect of this first visit. My new favorite Greek."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Highly recommended. Very short detour off of freeway headed toward Phoenix. We will be back"}
{"text":"Love this place!  They have been catering dinners, parties, and work events for us for years.  Food, service, prices are amazing.  Did I mention the food is amazing?  They offer authentic Middle Eastern food and a small grocery to purchase items hard to find in regular grocery stores.    They always deliver the orders on time no matter how big or small - 10 people or 300 people.  We also frequent there for lunch."}
{"text":"Great shawarma sandwich. Loves the atmosphere authentic hole in he wall with a great import market."}
{"text":"Very good middle eastern food. A combined restaurant and grocery, the type of fare is standard for middle eastern food: grilled meats, rice, and a \"greek\" kind of salad.  Their meals meet or exceeds the quality of other Phoenix area middle eastern restaurants, but they really stand out for their hummus.  I eat hummus as a major staple in my diet and have tried dozens of different brands and restaurants; theirs is quite good, and comes served with a very authentic green zhug which is very hard to find outside of a true middle eastern kitchen.  It is worth coming here for the hummus alone, and they sell it as a grocery item; just ask for the green zhug \"hot sauce\" to supplement it."}
{"text":"I HAVE FOUND THE MOST AWESOME RESTUARANT AND I WANT TO SCREAM IT FROM THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN!!!!  A co-worker and I decided to give this place a try and see if the gyros were better than our regular spot. My co-worker got the gyro and I decided I would try something different. I ordered the vegetarian plate #1 that comes with spinach pie, falafel, hummus and pita bread. It was so fricken good - I can't wait to go back and get it again! The spinach pie was my favorite item on the plate, but it was ALL so very tasty! My-coworker said the gyro was the best he has had, so we will definitely be back again - like tomorrow!! :)"}
{"text":"A true Mom and Pop restaurant. From the minute we walked in the door we knew we were welcome and about to experience a delicious meal made with love. Don't be fooled by the outside the food is great! I'm a vegetarian so I had the vegetarian omelette with feta cheese added. The spinacopita was perfect with yogurt dip on the side. We bought olives, tabouli and medjohl dates to go. We enjoyed every bite and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great gyros! They give tons of meat on a pita. The meat is well seasoned and I think they throw it on the grill before serving. Also has a great staff! I always feel welcomed here!"}
{"text":"The shawarma was good; the meat was tender, and the slices of pickled beets were a nice surprise. I also liked the blend of spices they used; I asked for it to be spicy, and was definitely given what I wanted. The baba ganoush, on the other hand, was flavorless, and had an odd texture. I threw about half of it away, and I love baba ganoush. I also ordered a piece of bakalava, which was tiny, and nothing to write home about.   The owner was very nice, and friendly, and the service at the counter was quick. I was happy to be able to buy labne, a favorite food from when I lived in the Middle East, though I would have liked fresh pita to go with it, which I am able to get at  my usual restaurant/market."}
{"text":"First time here and was pretty darn good.  The owners were sooooooooo cute and nice..they are the main reason I will be back."}
{"text":"I don't know what planet the other reviewers are from, but I just got back from the Olive Tree Market and Grill and it was TERRIBLE. My lunch partner had the \"classic\" gyro combo and I had the chicken \"schwarma\" combo.  There isn't anything good to say about this place.  Neither of us finished our lunches.  The fries were oversalted, the cold chicken schwarma was pre-cooked, sliced chicken breast with the WORST tzatziki sauce. His gyro was not fresh, it was room temperature, the meat was below average and the produce wasn't fit for rodents, all of it very sub-par.  The place was dirty, grimy and just overall disgusting. That's what we get for trying a different Mediteranean place."}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this place, tucked away in a small strip mall in a business area behind a hotel. Stopped in real quick and bought hummus, tabbouleh and pita. The hummus is yummy! Very tangy...tabbouleh is great too. The pita is packaged elsewhere, but very fresh and delish. This super casual restaurant has a small market with tons of nuts, hard to find middle eastern canned favorites and a small freezer section with phyllo and it looked like meat pies etc.  Their deli area wasn't opened for lunch yet, as I was there in the morning, but the menu looks like it has a great variety such as Kibbei, soups, salads,gyros, kabobs, shawarma, burgers...and they have a kids menu with burgers, dogs, chicken tenders and gyros.  Looking forward to eating lunch here soon. Seems like a really nice mom and pop middle eastern market and grill."}
{"text":"Great food, great price and really warm and friendly service. Perfect place for lunch."}
{"text":"MMM Just finished lunch here and already writing my review.  I gave them a 3 star not because the food wasn't delicious, but because the overall experience.    My dad and I got there a few minutes after 12.  We ordered our food and decided to sit outside since it was such a lovely day out and it was very clammy inside.  About 15mins later, I was told that they were out of spinach pies in my vegetarian platter.  I was really bummed, since the platter consisted of pitas, hummus, falafel and a spinach pie.  So another 15mins goes by before our food finally came out.  It was a bit frustrating waiting 30mins when you have an hour for lunch and everyone elses food came out before ours.  They ended up replacing the spinach pie with some herb covered pitas.  Which could have been great, if they weren't so hard.   The falafel was amazing, some of the best I've ever had.  The hummus was also really good and comes in a dish with a great presentation, just wish the pitas weren't so hard.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"This place has the best Greek salad around. Add gyro meat to it and it is over-the-top."}
{"text":"Chicken kabob was bland and chicken was a little dry. My friend's chicken Shwarma tasted like Indian food not Shwarma. Not typical middle eastern/Greek food.   Hummus and dolmades were good though."}
{"text":"Nice hello when we walked in to only find out that they close @ 4pm Saturday's not 8pm like it says here on Yelp. A 20 min drive in hot sun:(  They said we can place order for take out. So we did just that, I ordered my pita w/ no tomatoes. We waited maybe 3 minutes & man who took order came out to ask...\"was the tomatoes an allergy thing\" I said no I just don't like them. Got home to find several cut up tomatoes on the bottom of my sandwich...top ones seem to be scrapped off.  So I see it as they DIDNT CARE!!! If I did have allergies what would have you done..make it correctly? Will never get my business again since you can't trust them & don't care about new business since they have regulars.  CALL 1ST for hours on YELP"}
{"text":"First time to eat here! Wow, what a great find! This is a restaurant and a market that is in a little strip mall/shopping area.   The inside is open with plenty of seating. You order at the counter and your food is brought to you when it's done.   We ordered a gyro, Greek salad, and the spanikopita. The food came out quickly. It was delicious! Everything was fresh. The dressing for the salad was homemade. The meat on the salad and in the gyro was tender and had just the right amount of seasoning. The gyro was huge. The spanikopita had a flakey crust and went well with our meal.   Prices are good. Portion sizes just right. Service was excellent! Quick to take our order and bring our food.   Definitely will go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Tastiest Baklawa ...couldn't stop myself from eating 2 pieces. Small place and old owners with lots of warmth."}
{"text":"Excellent hummus, babaganoush, felafel, gyro here. Very nice owner as well. Thoroughly enjoyed our meals here with generous portions!"}
{"text":"Five times I have been here and have yet to be disappointed. The food is reasonably priced, always served hot, and the service is great.There is always an elderly gentleman there when I go, and his infectiously good attitude almost makes my day. The gyros combo with fries and a drink at $6.99 is a good deal. I love soup and their homemade lentil soup is very good. The place reminds me of cozy neighborhood joints growing up in Cleveland. An Old World kind of feel. They make you feel like old friends."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! And it's family owned, so it's great to support a fellow small family business. The gyro meat was some of the best I've had and he pita is so soft and delicious. Not to mention the awesome tzatziki sauce and excellent customer service! So excited I found a good Greek place near my office!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is not fancy but the food is great. Papa greets everyone. The restaurant is literally in the middle of a market. Everything is homemade. The portions are generous Nd the staff is friendly. A great lunch spot."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place.  We first went when we were moving nearby and the food was great.  I have been satisfied every time we go.  I like that it is a small family-owned restaurant and they are always very nice.  They are very nice to our kids when we bring them in, and help them with their selections.  I think this is a great place to take the family and it is not very expensive."}
{"text":"When we walked in the first thing we noticed is that it was a very pleasant and open atmosphere, We were greeted right away, The gyros are the best in town we've tasted, they have an extensive middle eastern menu and everything we that had tasted fresh! My favorite app was the homemade warm fresh grapeleaves. (Which is hard to find anywhere). I can't wait to come back with my friends and family!"}
{"text":"This is a great little half-market-half-restaurant. I was craving some Mediterranean food, hoping to find something quick and easy for lunch, and completely lucked out finding this place. The owners were friendly, and all the food looked fantastic. I settled on the vegetarian plate. The price was very fair for what you get, which is a large slice of spinach pie, four falafels, a huge bowl of hummus and slice after slice of warm pita to scoop it all up. That hummus, my word... They float chopped jalapeno on top, and it's stunning.    Olive Tree Market & Grill was incredibly charming, and the food was excellent. I hope to get a chance to stop by again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We love The Olive Tree! We call it 'the grill' We eat there at least once a week - my littlest one has swim lessons right next door. Both my picky eaters love eating there! We love the chicken kabobs and the chicken shwarma(sp?). Family ran, great food we love it!"}
{"text":"It is what it is. Best gyro in Deer Valley. Seems like they're going out of business though. Hope they don't."}
{"text":"Tasty gyros and great service! I found the classic gyro to be excellent. Really glad this is close to my work!"}
{"text":"Love this place from the Customer service to the amazing food! Favs are the Greek Salad with the meat (Salads are so much better than the Salad n Go place next door) and of course their Gyros!!! It's a cute family business and I can definitely appreciate the quality they provide in their food. Definitely gets busy at lunch time so call your order in ahead of time."}
{"text":"Gyro melts in your mouth. Literally! Everything was made fresh and we felt like we we in a regular small town mom and pop shop. Love this place already!"}
{"text":"This is a total gem! Owners are in store and cook for you! If you're in the area, bypass all the chains and stop here for authentic Greek food! You will walk away full, happy and stoked you found this place!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden neighborhood gem.  It reminds me of Haji Baba in Tempe - part grocery store, part delicious eats.    The gentleman behind the counter (presumably the owner?) was extremely friendly and welcoming.    We ordered the chicken kabobs and the vegetarian platter which included hummus, falafel and the eggplant dip which I won't even attempt to spell.  The chicken was juicy, flavorful and delicious.  The peppers that accompanied it were cooked to perfection as well.  The hummus was tahini-rich which makes it a winner for me.  They top it with a spicy green sauce which I thought was an interesting twist but the husband did not care for it too much.  The falafel and eggplant dip were delicious as well.  We ended our meal with baklava.  I don't know if it's made in house (we think maybe not) but either way, it's delicious.    If you need to stock up on tahini, this is the place to do it.  It's fun to poke around in the grocery area while waiting for your food.    Wonderful experience and we will defiitely be back!"}
{"text":"I randomly walked into this tiny place looking for a late lunch and I was warmly welcomed by the staff. The menu is easy to read and they have descriptions for those that aren't used to Greek food. I went with a straight forward order of a gyro and a side of hummus. The meat in the gyro is great. Lots of flavor and not dried out. The hummus had the perfect amount spice to keep it interesting but not make me run for the soda fountain. After your meal take a look at the store shelves, you may find something new to try.  I get suckered into the candy aisle of every foreign market I walk into. If candy isn't you thing then they have fresh baklava for sale at the main counter."}
{"text":"Food is great, prices are very reasonable.   Small nice family run, traditional ethnic persia/greek food.  Food was fresh, service was quick and place is clean!  ill be back!  AND BONUS! grocery store inside!!!"}
{"text":"The falafel was outstanding, savory, well-seasoned, moist. I've had falafel in middle eastern countries and this is absolutely on par. It's certainly the best I've had in Phoenix. The service was friendly and expedient. The restaurant was clean. Great value for the food and service."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and ordered the Chicken Shawarma. Food is very flavorful and the Shawarma had just the right balance of yellow curry! I would definitely stop by again.   My only criticism would be the price for what you get seems a little off. I was happy to not feel stuffed after eating, but I also wasn't full. For the price, I would suggest maybe adding a second Shawarma/Gyro."}
{"text":"This restaurant by far has the best Middle Eastern food I have had.   They catered a luncheon for us and everything was exceptional and there was plenty of food.  I would highly recommend trying their food if you haven't yet and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Good food and customer service.  They really know how to take care of their customers."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food. Go to place for gyros and falafel.  Try the Vitmo soda, it's black currant soda, kinda like a cream soda with a berry finish just great get one every time"}
{"text":"My sister in law introduced me to this place. Best gyros I have ever had!  Amazing house made baklava.  The owners are absolutely lovely.  Gyro plate is delicious.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast. Loved the veggie omelette with hash brown. Tony the owner is very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"It is safe to say that this place might be the best greek food I have had outside of Greece. It is a little out of the way if you don't live or work in the deer valley area but I like it so much I am willing to drive out there just to get some. Everything is amazing and reasonably priced. They also have a little market there with some pretty amazing Mediterranean goodies. I have recommended this place to numerous other people and every single person has been beyond impressed and went back.  The chicken shawarma plate is my favorite; the chicken is unbelievably flavorful, the jasmine rice is to die for, and the sauce that comes with it is the best part. The plates come with little salads. I've also tried to gyro plate and the lamb and they have been great as well. Honestly, there aren't enough good words to describe this little place, you just have to go and check it out yourself! 10% discount code if you check in on yelp!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We come whenever we're on the North side of town.  The food is awesome and the owners that run the place are amazing too!"}
{"text":"Great little mediterranean deli.  I had gyros, falafel and a salad.  All were terrific.  The market side of the place had lots of interesting stuff such as marinated peppers and the like."}
{"text":"I am going to pay for this meal, but I don't care.  I will run a few extra miles because it was so worth it.  My shawarma chicken was to die for.  The chicken was marinated to perfection.  I also had a side of baba ganoush, omg, so delicious. I also ended up eating half of my hubby's lentil soup.   I wish I had enough space for the spanakopita.  I had the baklava \"to go\" for later.  It didn't even make it to I 17.  It was freaking delicious, the honey and pistachios were so prevalent in the taste.  I am still dreaming about it.  I also shopped for a few items at the market.  What a cool place.  Can't wait to take the hike back to the west side."}
{"text":"I debated whether to eat Corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's day and I'm so glad I made the decision to eat here! Loved everything I ate!!! So happy!! The best decision I made!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the post for this restaurant I decided to give it a try. I tried one of the vegetarian plates. Spinach pie, hummus &falafel, and a Greek salad on the side. Very very good. The spinach pie and the Greek salad yum yum. This is a great little place, I will be back every time I come to town. The price is right, and good food. Nice family owned restaurant, give them a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food at Olive Tree is good, not my favorite Gyro place, but I would go again. The real gem here is their service. I had a 25.00 gift certificate from Restaraunts.com. Normally you have to dine in, but after a 10 hour day at work I just wanted to go home and guzzle food in my jammies. The owner said that was ok and that made me happy from the start.  It is family owned, and extremely authentic. The owner works with his wife and kids cook and run the store. The store sells classic mediterranean goods, canned olives, jars of tahini, greek candy, cheese, etc...  Since we had to spend 35.00, my boyfriend and I prepared for a shmorgas board of food that lasted us for days. We had:  Falafel - delicious. The pitas are different then most places as they are very thin, almost like naan. I prefer the thicker version. The falafel itself was spiced perfectly and the pickled veggies they use in all of their sandwiches are delicous, crunchy and set them apart from their counterparts. The tzatziki sauce was good, not my fave, that goes to Chicago Gyro on 7th and Union. It was thick and had nice slices of cucumber in it. And CHEAP! $4.00 for a falafel sandwich.  Chicken and beef shawarma - the chicken was ok, but the beef was great, which I'm not a big beef gyro fan.   Greek salad - very fresh and tasty.  Hummus - very good, homemade with a spicy relish on top.  Spinach pie - yuck, but just a person preference here. Not a fan.   I definetly recommend giving Olive tree a try."}
{"text":"So far, one visit, one large Greek Salad with Gyro meat on it.  Delicious!!  The Tzatiki sauce was tangy, creamy and fresh tasting.  The salad was well made--perfect sizing on the chop with flavorful salad dressing.  I can't wait to have it again. I'm looking forward to trying other items reviewers have mentioned but in the meantime, I'm a super fan."}
{"text":"Excelent Falafel - check  Great hummus - check Awesome spanakopita - check  **Warning** Beware that veggie doesn't always mean good for you.  While I normally try to skip the cabs, I just couldn't stop stuffing myself with those perfect triangles of warm pita covered with their garlic pepper hummus; it was just the right amount of spice with a more than right amount of awesome!  I don't eat falafel too often, but this was definitely the most interesting and tasty falafel I have had. Cover it with whatever that creamy sauce was and you're in vegan junk food heaven!  If you're wondering how the spanakopita (spinach pie) was, you just can't go wrong with this option. I was plesantly surprised when the spinach didn't taste like you're average cafeteria bitter blah, whatever-ness like I was half expecting. They perfectly topped the spinach with fresh feta - which was some of the better feta I've had in a while. Covered with flaky layers of filo dough and baked til perfection --- mmm its so good.  Olive Tree is super authentic with my only regret being that I didn't try the Gyro, I have a personal goal to find the valley's best gyro and have had one at close to 10 - 14 places thus far. For some reason, on my only visit here I was just feeling vegetarian, go figure. :/  I don't imagine I will be back too soon, since I hail from CenPho and this place is like 15 miles away, but it will definitely be a destination if I'm within a few miles around mealtime!

{"text":"Best chicken shawarma and hummus I've found in Phoenix! The food is fresh, DELICIOUS, and the folks who run the place are always so friendly and helpful. This is definitely my favourite restaurant in Phoenix and I always look forward to going there. Besides the restaurant, they also have a great little market."}
{"text":"I was hungry for Gyro. I checked Yelp and saw a place I had not heard of before.  It is a nice market and restaurant.  I wanted to sample a couple of menu items of my typical Mediterranean cravings.  Gyro - Lamb and beef and grilled. Decent portion too. Hummus was very good. Grape leaves are really good. The filling is seasoned well like they should be. Not the tasteless wrapped in a grape leaf. I could make a meal of these alone. I am glad I found them."}
{"text":"This was a little far out from where I live, but I was in search of fresh pita bread and some other items. This place is pretty much on the corner of 19th & Pinnacle Peak and in front of the Hilton Hotel. They have a very clean small market, but they carry everything you could want for in cooking middle eastern foods.  The also have a nice deli where they prepare fresh foods.  I tried their hummus which was very good. They did indeed have pita bread, nice and fresh; nice fresh vegetables, bakalava and other pastries as well as the previously mentioned food.   Their prices are very reasonable and the owners couldn't be nicer!  They carry items like tahini, olive oil, olives, dates, dried garbanzo beans, all sorts of spices, Turkish Delight (a sweet), tea, pita bread, fresh vegetables, just to name a few items. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Totally digging this place.  So I've had a gyro, a greek salad, and the chicken kabobs and every single one of them were EXCELLENT.  I highly recommend those chicken kabobs.  I love how they have a market right next to it, complete with the hookah selection. :)"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here on 9/11/2014 for the first time. I will cut to the chase and just say this place is delicious. I ordered the kebabs and my brother got the Gyro Plate with an appetizer hummus/pita. The flavors are wonderful and the salad dressing is oh so tasty. The owners were nice and lets just say we will be back to eat here again. I will be bringing my own container to buy that wonderful dressing for home :)"}
{"text":"My whole family loves this place!  Even the baby can't get enough of their split pea soup!  Tony and Juliette  (the owners) are kind and the best of hosts!  We have eaten there countless times, ordered take out and used their catering- all have been excellent!"}
{"text":"I spent two weeks in beautiful Phoenix at the end of Feb/ Beginning of March and work put me up in the Hilton Happy Valley Garden Inn.  I was exhausted after my first day on the new job and didn't feel like going out, so I ordered some take out from the Mediterranean place next to the hotel.  The owners and people who work there are all super sweet and the food...  Oh man, is it delicious!  My ex-husbands family is from Lebanon and all love to cook an eat, so I know what real Middle Eastern food should taste like, and I have to say, this is the real deal!  I have tried most of the menu and my top recommendations are Kibbeh (seriously, the best I've ever had.  You MUST try it!), tabbouleh (also made to perfection), the Vegetarian platter #1 with the delicious Spinach Pie, Falafel (flavorful and moist on the inside, cripsy on the outside with perfect texture), the very best Hummus I have ever tasted (and I have tasted so much hummus), pita and a delicious tahini with onion and spices mixed in.  The Pistachio Baklava is amazing too, but I don't recommend trying it because you will dream about it and have to fight the urge to order it daily.  -Great Food -Very reasonably priced -Very generous portions -FriendlyService  My only negative feedback is that they close at 7, so there were days I wanted to order take out, but didn't finish up at work in time to make it.  Now I want Kibbeh and Tabooli from Olive Tree but I'm stuck here in rainy Washington. Boo!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat gyros and falafels here regularly.  The food is consistently good and the service is friendly and prompt.  We frequently find interesting things while browsing the shelves in the market."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, especially the owner Tony who genuinely made us feel like family. We had various hummus platters, gyro plate, as well as mixed grill of various meats. It was very good, and relatively inexpensive. We will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants in Phoenix. The gyro meat is so tender, the hummus is flavorful and the baklava is decadent. They have a store as well with a variety of yummy exotic items to get your creative culinary skills whirling. To top it off, the couple who runs it is exceptionally friendly and warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"OMG their falafel are sooooo delicious ! They are moist fresh and crispy. You you can tell how good a mediterranean place is by their falafel. The pita was nice, the veggies were crisp and fresh. The sauce was creamy and enhanced the falafel. Perfect vegan pita wrap. Will return anytime I get a chance."}
{"text":"Besides the yummy food like my favorite GYRO and Split Pea Soup they have, I enjoy there Friendly customer service. You can tell that that their kindness is real and down to earth.   Good to eat inside or for take out."}
{"text":"The food is great and they take great care of me every time I come in!  I've only had a chance to eat a few times and i feel like I've only scratched the surface of the menu.  Plus they have a mini grocery store inside, I can't wait to start trying some of the food they import!"}
{"text":"The food is out of this world. My kids are pretty picky, but they've found that the \"white sauce\" (tzatziki) is \"sooooo GOOD!\" and the hummus is a winner also. My favorite is the chicken shawarma sandwich. We have made lunch here our Saturday routine after swimming lessons. The owners are just as fantastic as the food!"}
{"text":"deeeelishhhhh....bummed they arent open Sundays :{"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to go here for lunch; I drive by it every day on my way to work. A group of us went here for an end of year lunch meeting. I think the pricing is very fair with the amount of food you receive. You order at the counter and they have a pick up area; although when we went they just brought the food direct to our table. Nice choices plus they have a mini-market which is a good place to find more cultural items you don't find in stardard grocery stores. Plenty of seating in the place if you have a larger group too; I'd say in total the place can seat up to 100 ppl. The staff was very friendly and quickly corrected a couple mis-orders. I will go back again soon; I predict my 4 stars will change to 5-star after a couple more visits."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food around.... everything on their menu is quality and delicious.... service is always prompt and with a smile.... highly recommend the Fattoush salad with gyro meat......"}
{"text":"Good quality, tasty, and generous portions."}
{"text":"I had the Philly Cheesesteak with the onions and peppers topped with a little cheese. I will be back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING semi quick Very Casual not fancy Mid East/ Greek style Grill.  I've been pleased with everything I tried here over the years and the Olive Tree Market & Grill is really at the TOPS for a Grill of it's kind and it's a must stop to kind of place if you are in the area.  The falafels are among the best in the valley and the sauces and dips are outstanding. They bake at least one of the breads in house I think it was the pitas. The salad here is the BEST I've had at any of these kind of places by a long shot. Kabobs are delicious and I like their shawerma more than others I've tried. Portions are large and prices are low. The food has always been fresh.  They sell some produce and hard to find jarred and dry items and lots of variety of bulgur including the whole grain style.  The owners are exceptionally nice and sweet you are always made to feel very welcome here.  A Gem in this area for sure.  4.5 stars"}
{"text":"BAKLAVA!!! There BAKLAVA is amazing and they have like 5 kinds which is crazy because I thought there was only one kind(its the walnut one there u will understand if u go!).  Anyway aside from that all the food Is great from gyros to cheeseburgers!  You won't be disappointed, and don't let the market part with odd unlabled things intimidate you, its def worth checking out !"}
{"text":"The hubby and wife who run this place are most adorable and the food is delicious. The highlight for me here is the hummus. I am obsessed with it and actually will order the appetizer and then get some to go for the week. I won't get hummus from the grocery store anymore. So delicious. Their pita sandwiches are pretty good as well as the plates."}
{"text":"We had a great time here! We had gyros and fries. The food was very good and the people were super friendly. The market is fun to look around in. We will be back."}
{"text":"Shwarema plate, pistachio baklava, salad, and coffee  Gyro plate, salad, and pistachio baklava  The baklava at this comfortable market was a revelation to me. I have apparently never had exceptional baklava, this is now fixed."}
{"text":"Ah-mazing gyro--- pita bread slightly oiled and toasted, lamb seasoned well, fresh, hot... awesome. Side of taziki sauce unfortunately could use some fresh dill, but ok. Fries were hot and fresh. Staff amazingly pleasant and helpful. I will be back!"}
{"text":"First, I would like to say that this is a deli in a Mediterranean market.  Second, the food at the Olive Tree is as good as or better than all of the Mediterranean sitdown restaurants I have ever eaten. (I really don't know why the previous reviews were so harsh.  This food is good.) Because we had to order $50 worth of food with our restaurant.com gift certificate from a deli, we ordered a lot of food.  Of the items that we tried, all were outstanding.  The Olive Tree used the best ingredients in all of the foods we ate. We asked the woman in charge if we could have our Gyro and Philly Cheesesteak (okay it wasn't all Mediterranean) while we were waiting for the rest of our food to cook.  She immediately turned and asked the cook to make those two items first.  (The man and woman who were in charge were very friendly and professional.) We sat at the tables and enjoyed our first two servings.  We knew right away that we were in for something special. After we got the rest of our food, we drove home and we ate our kebbi and spinach pie and I ate the gyro I ordered (we ordered two gyros).  Delicious.  The bread on the spinach pie was freshly baked and the ingredients in all of the items were fresh and perfectly balanced. (I have been to many Mediterranean delis looking for a great gyro only to be disappointed by a Sysco or similar style gyro.)  I don't know if the meat on this gyro were made in house but it was excellent. Later that night, we had the meat pie with sauce, fettouch salad, shish kabob and some pita bread with the jalepeno hummus.  Outstanding (even though the food had been reheated).  Unfortunately, the pita was stale by the time we got to it, but the flavors were there.  I just wish I had room in my stomach to eat  the pita while it was still fresh. We still have more food to eat tomorrow and probably the next day. Do yourself a favor before going to the restaurant if you are going to use the restaurant.com GC.  Get some friends together, go to restaurant's website olivetreeaz.com and look at the menu.  Order ahead and get the food to go.  Get it home quickly and eat.  This is really great food and it needs to be eaten as soon as possible once it comes off the grill. If you are taking a trip north to Flag or the Grand Canyon, make it a point to stop here and fill up before you start your journey.  It is only a mile or so off of 17 and it is worth the drive. The Olive Tree is a deli and the food is at deli prices.  The food is an outstanding value. Eat at the Olive Tree.  Your palate will thank you and your pocket book will thank you. Postscript:  The market has a huge selection of mediterranean foods and spices at very good prices."}
{"text":"This is the real deal, totally authentic and so so tasty.  A casual place with about 15 or so tables inside a quaint market that you can peruse while you food is being made,  I saw some past reviewers complain about how long it took to get your food, while yes there is a wait it is because your meal is being made on the spot when you order it, anyway walking through the market is a great way to spend that wait.  Hummus was good and the Greek salad is my new favorite,  we also split the combo plate, the chicken shwarma was hands down the best I have ever had and should be dipped in the oh so amazing tazilki sauce,  The chicken kabob should not be missed,  husband had gyros and he was moaning a little inappropriately while eating them.  The guy that owns is not only totally genuine but probably one of the nicest men on the planet."}
{"text":"Lovers of Lamb beware! I must have come after the lunch rush or maybe they could care less about the quality of their lamb. Instead of going for the classic Gyro, especially when I try a new Greek or Middle Eastern restaurant.   I ordered the Lamb Kabob, served with a very modest portion of rice with just a small hint of citrus and the Hummus. The first red flag was the lamb was not skewered, it was just a small pile of slightly charred chunks of meat sitting on top of grilled vegetables.   The lamb was probably the second worst quality of lamb I have ever tasted. It was tough, lacking any freshness at all, the meat was so questionable that I can only think to myself, I hope I don't get sick from this meal.   The sauce, which is apparently supposed to be a complement to the lamb tasted more like a curdled yogurt with a sharp metallic taste.   You have a choice of soup or salad and I chose the Lentil soup, a soup this easy shouldn't be as hard as apparently it is for their complete lack of skills; bland, boring, and not enough lentils for my taste, I personally prefer a thicker Lentil soup. I've worked in many kitchens and I will still attest that if a kitchen can make a good soup, the rest will follow in the beautiful quality of what careful planning can do. Back to the drawing board for this lazy kitchen.   The best part was the Hummus, beautiful presentation with sliced beets and a nice subtle hint of garlic lingering in the background. Overall, the service was great and very friendly, but friendly service is not enough to invoke me to return and I will more than likely skip this place and try somewhere else for a real lamb kabob."}
{"text":"Awesome out of the way place with great food. Nice to have something different than the usual burger, sandwich or salad. Sweet couple run this 'mom-n-pop' place. Great customer service & variety of food. Love the casual atmosphere. Check this place out when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Some of the best ground beef I've ever had.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Probably the best hummus I've ever had. All the food was amazing...got one of the vegetable platters and was definitely pleased. Will order again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times in the past two years and stopped in again today for a quick lunch. The lady at the register says, \"haven't seen you in a while!\" I was taken aback that she remembered me! I'm happy to say that I really like this little family-run market/deli and their fantastic selection of foreign groceries. While I wait for my order I love looking at their strange and wonderful selection of canned and dried goods, most especially their sweets!   Very good customer service and the little man with glasses is seemingly always sprightly and comical.   I get their Gyros and it's always fresh and tasty. I'm sure I'll be back many more times."}
{"text":"Well over due for an update.   The owners 5 Stars The market 5 stars The food darn near 5 stars  I had the burger the other day..way impressed. It was double thin patties with hummus and cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion if you wish. It wasgood and filling.   Today I had the Gyro with salad and a drink."}
{"text":"I've been to the Olive Tree Mediterranean Market and Grill a couple of times now for lunch.  This is small Mediterranean market with a restaurant on the side.    This review is for the grill area.   On my last visit I ordered and Gyros combo, which was their featured item  of the day at $6.99 for a Gryos, fries and drink which was posted outside.  I asked if I could get the combo but substitute the fries for a small salad?  She said \"yes, but there is an additional charge of $3\"...    Since a really wanted a side salad and not fries I paid the extra charge.      I decided to order just the Gyros sandwich and a small side salad.  She stated \"that will be $11.45, did you want a drink with that?  I stated \"I thought a drink came it\", she stated \"no, that's an additional charge\"...  This place is way too expensive for the quality of food you get when compared to any of the Greek restaurants around Phoenix.  The upside to this somewhat expensive lunch was the food was very good.  My Gyros was just OK, but my Greek salad was very good!  It was also served on a glass dish with real flatware which is a plus for me."}
{"text":"Amazing food and very humble owners!!!! The wife and husband Sam are the happiest people I have ever met! They never stop smiling and thanking their customers. They make you feel so welcome In their establishment! Besides the ethnic groceries you can find here, the food was delicious. I recommend the gyros salad!! My father introduced me to this place and when we walked in they greeted us as if we were family! Oh I almost forgot the Kibbeh was also so tasty....hands down one of my favorite places in Arizona"}
{"text":"Delicious food,from the philly cheesestake to the meat gyros, and the best thing is that every time it tastes the same great quality, also tasteful  options of appetizers Love this place Thank you"}
{"text":"Delicious medetrian food. Trully a unique restaurant in the area. And talk about the amount of food you get. You'll have enough for two meals. Their flafels are delicious and so as their lamb. The salad is good too. Their ubereats ordering is really nice as it lets you choose what to put on the salad. Also, I like having extra meats, and they make it easy to add more protein  and charge barely anything.  Try them through the ubereats app. Easy easy to enjoy medetrian food right at home.  Use my code eats-mbdvx to get discounts on your order."}
{"text":"I have been to Olive Tree Mediterranean Market several times, yet I have only had a few items on their menu because they are sooo good!  The babaganoush,  hummus, and falafel platter is really good.  My friend and I generally get it with an extra side of falafel and it is more than enough to feed two.  The falafel, hands down, is the best I've ever had.  The atmosphere is nice as well.  The owners are pleasant and they recognize us, which is a plus.  The market is pretty interesting as well."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh chicken shawarma wrap. Babaganoush dip with pita is amazing. Friendly family owned spot. Picked up some random middle eastern cheeses and groceries as well. Glad I stopped by, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered Greek salad with gyro meat and WOW!    Interesting place, restaurant and market combo.  Neat to walk around and browse  Mediterranean food while waiting for your order.  Family run establishment, casual atmosphere, and excellent food.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Although the storefront doesn't look like a restaurant, enter and the food smells delicious. The family is friendly, passionate and attentive. They suggested several items for order and we loved every taste of it. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The food is great. I had the chicken shawarma and my husband had the lamb gyro- it came out quickly and tasted perfect. It seems like a family run place and the staff was friendly and really made you feel welcome. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice discovery on the North Phoenix landscape.  They have a good variety of mediterranean options.  I think everything should be about one dollar cheaper since it's just over the counter service.   However, they use real plates and silverware, which is a definite plus.  The food is very good.  I eat here all the time during the work day and I'm never disappointed.  I get the soups a lot, which are always good.  The hummus is really good, too.  I'm a fan of the chicken shawarma and shish kabob as well.  The adjoining market is a nice addition and can make the trip more worthwhile.    I've been very happy with the veggie platters.  I think vegetarians will find plenty of options either with the platters or by building up sides.  I'll continue to frequent this place because I work close by and this is far more interesting than most of the food in the area.  They never let me down."}
{"text":"An ok type of restaurant. Prices are very reasonable.  Tried the chicken kabab.. It was very average in taste. Overall a very average review."}
{"text":"Fabulous authentic meal at this desert gem!!  Finished this truly unforgettable meal with Turkish coffee and walnut baklava.  They have pistachio or walnut baklava. We had shiska bob, gyro, shawarma, salads and spinach pie.  Every single morsel is delightfully outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Always love coming here. The food is good and the staff is always very helpful. While I Work nearby my son drives all the way up from Avondale to eat at this specific restaurant. You can't go wrong with a kabobs!"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken schwarma if you're looking for a hot warm meal after a long flight. The staff were friendly and courteous, and gave me great recommendations on what to eat. I loved that the market also had water and other drinks to purchase."}
{"text":"I'm upgrading Olive Tree to 5 stars.  This place just rules it.   Tony and Juliet are super friendly and extremely talented cooks.  I want them to live at my house and cook all my meals.  The shawarma, hummus, tabbouleh, gyros, falafel, foul, soup, kifta....everything is incredible.    They have this spicy sauce called \"Shatta\" (lol) for sale in the market section. I think it's just red peppers & olive oil, but it's pretty much my new favorite thing."}
{"text":"Great place! Breakfast lunch and dinner. It has a small grocery for you to get middle eastern delights. They do some of there own pastries and it was delicious. We had something that came with honey on top and served warm. I'm unsure of the spelling but highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Had a dine-in lunch here today after finding this location near the office that I'm visiting this week. It's in a busy, new-ish strip mall with a variety of businesses. Parking isn't plentiful per se, but I found a spot fairly easy even during a busy lunch period.   Moving inside, the business is, as its name suggests, both a market and a restaurant. Orders are taken at a walk up counter, and if you dine in, it's brought to your table as the food is ready. To go orders can be picked up at the other end of the counter when your number is called. A few shelves and some refrigerated cases encompass the market side, as well as some bulk bins near the register, separate from the restaurant but in the same room.   After perusing the menu, I selected the combo platter with falafel, beef kebab, and lamb kebab. The platter comes with soup or a salad; I opted for the yellow pea soup. Also provided are little cups of garlic sauce and another sauce that contains tomato and parsley, but I'm not sure what it's called. Both of the sauces were quite tasty, with the former getting regular use with the meats during my meal. Finishing it off is a good portion of yellow rice and a large pita. The verdicts:  Yellow pea soup: Presenting similar to an American split pea soup, this bowl was more yellow in color, served quite hot, and had a delicious and well seasoned flavor, The peas were pureed to a fairly fine consistency, but there was enough texture remaining for interest. I added a little Tabasco to give it some heat, and it was a delicious starter.   Falafel: A nice, above average instance of the classic sandwich filling, the platter featured four of them (definitely enough to share). Seasoning, texture, and flavor were all spot on, and they were cooked perfectly.   Beef kebab: Very tender meat pieces were seasoned well and cooked to a just-well done, and were still juicy and flavorful. The meat was delicious, especially with a little of the garlic sauce.   Lamb kebab: Slightly less tender (but not overly so) and a little lighter in color than the beef, these morsels had a great yet subtle lamb flavor, with none of the gaminess that can sometimes be present. This was a great example of the classic Greek kebab.   Pita and rice: These were fairly basic accoutrements; the pita was fresh, and the rice was well cooked with a very mild flavor. I mostly left them on the plate, as I was all about the meat.   This was a very nice platter, and especially with the rice and large pita, two people could easily share this dish. A good experience all around!"}
{"text":"I was craving good Mediterranean food and finally tried this little gem! Wow, the flavors are like no other place I've been. I fell in love with Pita J when they first came out but have not had the greatest food from the Norterra location, so I tried Olive Tree as they got good reviews. I highly recommend this market and grill. Loved the Veg Platter 2, chicken shawarma and spanakopita! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! Small family ran market with excellent gyros, kabobs, and much more. don't forget to try the baklava!"}
{"text":"Great little place to stop for lunch and get all your Greek food needs! I had a very delicious Gyro sandwich with baklava. Classic food and the prices/ portions are very reasonable. Don't forget to stop by the shop to get some Turkish delight or middle eastern tea. The owner and staff are so welcoming and friendly!! It seems like they get a ton of regulars and I can see why."}
{"text":"Gyro:  Fresh tender meat--maybe not enough tzatzki--but just perfect really. Hummus:  Beautifully presented with picked beets, delicious and served with thin quarters of pita. Love these two items and would return again just for these.  My partner who ordered a kabob got gristle and fat. Too bad she didn't get what I had. And if you wondered, I think the guy who owns this place is from Jordan."}
{"text":"Found this place while out for a walk, we were staying at a hotel nearby. Place was dirty which gave us us a yucky feeling but the food was fresh and good. If they gave a good cleaning it could have 4-5 stars easy."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and got the 3 meat combo. Chicken was good but the lamb was a little tough. Will return again when in the area. Baklava was good too but my piece was tiny."}
{"text":"The best of the best Meterterian Food in town.Owners are very friendly and all the food is out of this world.We have never had anything that we did not like.  To make things handy they even have a market there with everything  one may need.If you don't try it you will miss out on the delicious food and a fun time.It is the best I've had, We have taken friends from Dubai. I would rate this as a 10+you can't beat it anywhere.  I would rate it a 9 star rating"}
{"text":"We split the combo platter and asked for their 3 most popular choices.  It was delicious, even the salad had us licking the bowl."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!! Amazing food and super friendly service. I'll get all the baklava to go please! Definitely will come back to try some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"I must admit that I'm a regular to this place and I usually stick to a side of Falafel and Hummus. Not that their gyros and sandwiches are bad or ordinary, it's just that you can easily tell that their Falafel and Hummus are freshly made and very savory. I've tried most of the items on the menu and the gyro sandwich, which everyone seems to like here, comes a close second to the falafel. I wouldn't rate their Chicken Shwarema very high since I've had better ones - especially at Biaz Market -   but the other items on the menu like the Baklava or their Spinach pie are very good indeed.   The Olive Tree and Market is run by a Jordanian duo who are very friendly, if not sometimes subservient, and in general give this place a very nice and homely vibe.  Should checkout definitely."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! I was raised on Mediterranean food, so I'm extremely picky... so when I took that first bite of falafel, I was in heaven! It was then followed by some of the most spectacular hummus I've ever experienced (that uses exceptional olive oil), and the baklava... scrumptious!   Along with the food being as great as it is, the service is wonderful! The lovely people there were so friendly and wonderful!   This is definitely going to be my go-to place!"}
{"text":"we ordered fatoush salad, hummus, kefta kabob, gyros plate and side salads. everything was full of flavor and the husband and wife were very nice as well as the assyrian lady.  will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a great health lunch spot! Also there is a mini Greek market inside so if you need any groceries you can kill two birds with one stone. The chicken kabob, Greek salad and the falafel are my go to. The gyros are great as well but a little too heavy for lunch for me.  If you want a great Greek salad with chicken have them put chicken kabob meat on a Greek salad. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  So this place is now my top favorite place to get real and authentic chicken schwarma and gyro sandwich!  This is a small mom and pop mini market along with a simple sit-in restaurant where you can enjoy a quick lunch.  I wouldn't know what to buy or suggest from the market since I am unfamiliar with the items available.  No doubt in my mind that I was hungry for the food here.  I ordered a chicken schwarma sandwich for about $7.  You can check in to receive 10% off your order.  The staff members were all so kind!  That's always a plus in my book.    We sat down and the food arrived to our table in about 5-10 minutes for 3 orders.  The first order was a typical gyro sandwich plate, which included a Greek salad and fries.  The meat was sliced thin, yet each piece was tender and juicy.  So delicious!  The fries were made well...not too soggy and not too fried.  The second order was the chicken schwarma plate, which included salad, Saffron rice, and a pita bread.  The salad was well balanced with just enough dressing.  I loved the flavor of the sauce that came with the chicken...some type of garlic sauce.  The chicken was also juicy and tender. (I'm getting this next time.)  Finally, the third order was the chicken schwarma sandwich.  Same perfect chicken but wrapped in a pita bread.  What i noticed with this chicken gyro sandwich was the added pieces of beets.  I have never had it served with beets.  But I loved it!  All 3 of us loved it!  I think it's safe to say that we would definitely come back here again and again!  Thanks for making our first experience enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Well I have to say the food is tasty and fresh and very good and service was great however it is over priced and the amount they give you was ridiculous. I mean come ' on chicken and rice is not costly. I was so disappointed with my $20 order to get what I got. Perhaps they put very little food for takeout orders. I don't know. Sadly I would reconsider going back."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for lunch if you work in the area. This is a great alternative to The same old chain restaurants, crazy packed and overpriced Norterra spots. They always have lunch specials and you get a lot of food for a very reasonable price. It is a grocery store/cafe and the owners are very nice. Has all the normal mediterranean/middle eastern items that one would except along with some other basic grocery items. They open early so I can grab some fruit in the morning and they stay late till 7 or 8pm so i can get some shisha or hookah coals on my way home. Chicken schwarma plate and gyro plate are my favorite so far. Plus get the spicy sauce, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here. Been wanting to try this place after reading all of the positive yelp reviews. The food lives up to its reviews."}
{"text":"Found this place on accident a few days ago while driving out to Vegas. Loved it so much, we ate here a second time a few days later on our way back from Vegas. Everything we had (shish kabob, chicken shawarma and kifta kabob) was bursting with exotic flavors. Folks, this place is the real deal,  NOT immitation middle Eastern cuisine. If I didn't live 60 miles away, I'd eat here almost every day!!! I will be making some special road trips out to Olive Tree in the near future, ITS THAT GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Bomb hummus and falafals! Super friendly owners that are genuine in earning your business. Love it."}
{"text":"By far the best Hummus and Baba on the north side of phoenix.   The owners are so nice and I can't stop eating there.   Everything is always fresh and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out this spot for a while now and finally did today. I'm glad I did. We were greeted right when we walked through the doors by the sweet owner. I ordered 2 gyros sandwiches to-go. The gyros meat was flavored perfectly. I love a lot of taziki sauce, so if you do too, just order a little side of it. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Short and sweet. This is a very authentic Mediterranean market and grill. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Waiting for a friend to pick me up, decided to go in here. A said they serve breakfast. I wound up having something with feta cheese and spinach. Delicious. Friendly service. I plan to come back soon :). Such a nice spot to sit outside and enjoy food (until summer lol). But I plan to be back. Hands down, try this place. Tabouli looks good too."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean Market I've ever been to!! Very friendly staff and great fast service! Staff is very helpful with any questions you have. The market is fully stocked with all Greek, Lebanese, and Mediterranean food. The grill and food is very authentic and yummy. This market and grill is very clean also! I will continue to always go to this grill and market. Thank you Olive Tree so happy I found you!"}
{"text":"Love their food! Lots of stuff made from scratch, this is not one of the cookie cutter greek restaurants you find so often in Phoenix that primarily serve previously frozen, then deep fried foods. Everything is fresh & delicious! Very friendly owners."}
{"text":"The food was incredibly authentic and amazing! It was the best gyro and tziziki I've ever had! The man who took our order was so kind and helpful. This place is a gem, and I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We were hoping to try out Z's deli, in the same plaza - but arrived late and they were closed. This place was open, so we walked in. It was about 20 minutes before closing, and I'm pretty sure the family (seems like a \"family run joint\") was just about to break down the kitchen and pack it in.   I ordered the gyros plate, Athena went with the kebabs. Beef, to be exact. Our dinners both came with soup or salad. If I recall, there were 3, maybe 4, types of salad and one soup to choose from. We both opted for Greek salads. The owner (I assume he was the owner) took our order and called it out to the cook. Athena conversed with him a bit, putting in an order for some baklava to go, when we left, while I strolled the cheese section of the market.   The owner asked if we would like our salads first, and we said yes. I sat down at one of the nine tables, while Athena perused an aisle or two. In addition to delivering our salads to the table, the owner retrieved silverware and napkins for us from the trays located by the drink machine that I was filling drinks at. The brewed ice tea container had already been drained, or was at least empty, and the owner offered to brew fresh for us! We politely declined the offer and opted for soft drinks. No reason to brew fresh for two people when you are trying to close, but so nice to offer!  The salads were ultra tasty, with a sprinkling of sheep's milk feta atop a crisp green salad with kalamatas, romas, cukes and plenty of sliced pepperoncini (I'm going to say they were Italian, not Greek ). The salads were perfectly dressed and ultra tasty.   Our plates arrived, mine with thick fries cooked in peanut oil, hers with perfectly cooked Basmati rice and a nice yellow color to it. Her kebabs were already removed from the sticks, and all the veggies and steak were charred very nicely. The Tahini sauce was pretty decent.  My Gyros (traditional lamb/beef combo) were cooked very well, with ultra thin slices off the spit. Tzatziki sauce was nice and tangy, I'd guess made with Greek yogurt as opposed to regular yogurt or the sour cream others try to pass off! The fries were a bit on the soft side, but nicely cut and flavorful.  As we ate, the cashier closed down the market station and tidied up. The owner continued to stop by and make sure everything was good. It was! He was very friendly, and seemed genuinely concerned with our satisfaction.   We assured him we would be back to eat, and to do some shopping, as we had discussed the many types of oils available (you gotta try the avocado oil with lime - along with plenty of other oils available by the silverware). Since they were ready to close, we didn't think now would be the time to peruse the many varieties of dry/canned goods available, or the fresh cheeses. There was an aisle I didn't even go down, so that will be a surprise when we return, which we will.  I give this place kudos, and I think it will fill a niche market for groceries to be sure. It should do well - even with 2 other delis in the plaza. Each seems to cater to a slightly different deli crowd.  Definitely check it out.   Solid 4 stars on food freshness, and quality. Another star for great service and a nice, clean European grocery."}
{"text":"wow!  what an amazing place!  The owners are sooooo nice, and the food is delicious.  The food is authentic and well priced.  The market has some interesting food as well."}
{"text":"Returned for a quick lunch and got the classic gyro sandwich with fries.  Nice portion size.  Fries were not over cooked - done just right.  Extra yogurt sauce in a little plastic cup in the to-go box was a nice and welcome touch.  Have a selection of unusual drinks and I had a Jaritto (?) mango soda from Mexico.  Tasty - although my colleagues kept teasy me about drinking a beer!  You could tell it was Friday!  Also, I tried a few of the little plastic wrapped candies they have in bins near the front of the store.  The nougat with pistachio nuts in it was very good.  The one which is orange with a date center looked better but I was disappointed in the flavor intensity.  Still tasty though."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and looked for things close to hotel. This was rated well and did not disappoint. Clean dining area and friendly service along with a great babaganoush and lamb gyro. Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We take training classes here every time we're in town. Always a hit!  Great family run business."}
{"text":"I've had several opportunities to visit this storefront operation in North Phoenix.  Menu is varied Lebanese food with generally large portions.  Proprietor does the cooking; the food is somewhat hit or miss.  The problem is that many food items are prepared in advance, then reheated/re-grilled, which results in dried out kabobs, mushy soups, etc.  Best choices seem to be apps.  Large grocery selection; pleasant staff.    Best days to eat are Tuesday/Wednesday for freshest food; avoid Mondays as they are closed on Sunday, and much of the available food tastes as if it is left over from the week-end."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! :) The food is amazing and the market is a great place to browse while waiting for your order. Our first visit the older couple working the counter were so sweet and helpful. They offered us samples of everything - baklava, lentil soup, hummus, etc. The hummus is addicting, I could eat it daily."}
{"text":"So sad..... I pulled up an there are now \"out of business \" signs on the door  I hope they open somewhere else"}
{"text":"Wow, like yum. Love this place. Had falafel, tabboule, hummus and zatar pie. I would recommend them all. I will for sure be back and I hope they open a bunch of these all over Phoenix. Nice food!"}
{"text":"We go to this restaurant/market a lot for the following reasons:  Super nice couple that make you feel like long-time friends. Awesome food - especially recommend the hummus, falafel, gyros, split pea soup and chicken kabobs. Great neighborhood store to shop for Arabic food supplies and grab a yummy bite to eat."}
{"text":"This place is a bit different than what I have experienced in the US. It is a small specialty grocer with a small restaurant in it. The food here is very good and I would recommend it to anyone who wants some home-style mediterranean food. The baclava is very good and you should give it a try if you enjoy pastries."}
{"text":"I go went here often when I lived in the area and now when we come to visit for the lentil soup for husband and dolmas for me. Had baklava this last time and it was exceptionally good - crispy top layer with lots of pistachios or walnuts (depending on version) and just enough gooey goodness to not overpower. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I used to stop in here pretty frequently a few years ago when I lived closer and the food always good. I was in the neighborhood yesterday and stopped in for some hummus, baba ghanouj, tzatziki and Tabouli salad to go. Nothing has changed. They were all very good."}
{"text":"Every Gyro place uses pretty much the same stuff, but their Tsatziki sauce sets them apart.  They use some kind of high end greek yogurt that they sell in their market.  Always quick friendly service and a consistently good meal.   Ask for Tony, the owner, he is a somewhat elderly short Greek guy that has a perpetual smile on his face and responds to everyone as \"my friend\", \"Oh, yes my friend\" or \"Oh very good my friend\" etc. You just can't help but love the guy."}
{"text":"This place has the best falafel I've found in PHX! Green almost-fluffy inside, crunchy but not greasy outside. Delicious! Their fresh baba ganoush was great too! They're happy to sub in veggies for pitas in dips as well. Also, this is a great place to stock up on spices, delicacies from the mediterranean area, and other handy items like puff pastry dough or tahini. The owners are so friendly too!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh falafel, wonderful friendly owners &  creamy Bulgarian feta for sale in the market. A truly delightful find."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic, family style Middle Eastern food and market, I think you're going to have a hard time finding better than The Olive Tree.  It's run by a Jordanian family that couldn't be nicer or more on top of their food game.  They're making cheeses, curing olives, baking baklava...all the good stuff you want from a specialty market.  The market itself is clean, well stocked and appears to have solid turnaround on their products.  The grill can't be beat...the best kebab I've had (in the US).  Everything is super fresh and made to order.  The tabouli is awesome! Get the combo plate - choice of any three meats with basmati rice, salad, pita and garlic sauce.  The breakfast options are great too, for all you early birds.   Stop searching for good Greek/Mid-East/Kebab, you've found the right place!"}
{"text":"Wow the baba was silky smooth with a very pleasing eggplant flavor, and the hummus & falafel were nice as well.  Good presentation and flavors in the food.  This is really a market with a little cafe/grill that has a few tables with chairs, so unless it's outside the rush dining hours I would just plan on getting it to go.    Prices are reasonable as well.  Only negative was the wait time for the food, even when it wasn't very busy.  But I suppose good things come..."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere is \"diner\", the food was amazing.  The day we were there, was a large table sharing, eating and laughing.  But the star of our experience was the food. Constant companion had gyro and fries and I had vegetarian plate #1.  The spinach pie was the best I ever had.  And I had enough food for the next day.  We will go back and take others!"}
{"text":"(I would give them a 5, but they are new and need some time before they rate a 5.)  My husband is from Greece, well Crete, actually.  We stumbled on this place on the way home one day and thank goodness we did!  We didn't get a chance to eat in the deli (although the owner kept bringing us samples to try), but we did shop in the market.  It is a very new store, so the shelves aren't full yet, they're trying to figure out what the customers want.  We felt the selection was very good--canned goods, dried beans, fresh fruits and vegetables, frozen meats, and of course olives and feta and desserts.  The prices are very reasonable.  My husband says they're better than anywhere he's seen.   We got a leg of lamb and it was the most tasty lamb I've had in a long time.  I'm a fan of sheep feta, whether French or Bulgarian.  I think we got the Bulgarian this time.  Everything we got (except the Baklava-type desserts, I wasn't so crazy about them, and I love dessert!!)  The owner let us try their hummus, tabouli, and falafal -- all were fantastic!!  The owner even showed us his catalog and said he would special order anything we wanted!  Super friendly, clean, good menu in the cafe, can't wait to try it!  This is a fantastic jewel of a place on Pinnacle Peak & 19th Ave, just south of Norterra."}
{"text":"Seriously, the most friendly business I have EVER been to. As soon as we walked in we were made to feel like family. The owner started to chum it up w my friend who is also Arabic. They even gave her the 10% discount without using the check in.   The food is very international and bursts of flavor. The gyro meet is crispy on the edges, the fries are seasoned well, and the salad was put together with crunchy veggies, feta and balsamic. I really respect the use of real plates, bowls and silverware. But most of all, coming to my table to ask how the food is AND engage in conversation.  ALSO, the store has its own grocery marketplace. The store has items you wouldn't typically find in your local grocery store. There is Arabic food, fresh produce and goat milk. I left this experience feeling very cultured and love the fact that we stumbled upon this gem. I don't live on this side of town but any time I am over here, I will be back."}
