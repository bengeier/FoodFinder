{"text":"Stopped by for a coffee and ice cream with a friend. I tried a sampler with three scoops; vanilla bean, chocolate swirl and dulce de lÃªche. Great atmosphere and artwork (for sale) on display from local artists. I have no problem recommending Iron Rose for a relaxing pit stop on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to the tea gallery. While the place is still cute with tasteful decor, the food and the tea are unfortunately not up to the same standard. The rating is the average of two visits.
The afternoon set tea I had couple months ago was just outstanding, from the lovely tea pots to the excellent little sandwiches, all were delightful. The lady on that Sunday prepared everything fresh. The melted cheese, proscuitto on baguette and thinly sliced apple and cream cheese on crustless bread were easily the best tea sandwiches I have tasted anywhere in Ontario. The only disappointment was the desserts which were a bit stale but the friendly service more than made up for it. I vowed to come back as soon as I could.
The second visit was on a weekday. They don't serve afternoon tea on weekdays. The soup we had was average. The croissants were a little on the dry side. The tea, served in a cup without the tea leaves, was sadly weak and not very hot. 
Judging from the design of the their afternoon menu, someone here knows about tea and cares about quality. I may give it another try to see if they can get the execution more consistent."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we came here. The croissants were massive and delicious. The tea selection also really great. I will be back when in this area and I would even consider making a special trip. I'm surprised they weren't busy but they are around the corner. Find them, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We stopped in the Iron Rose Tea Gallery on our way  to the Train Museum. They had a sign outside advertising Ice Cream. I had the Sticky Toffee ice cream and my fiance had the Niagara Cherry. I thoroughly enjoyed the homemade ice cream.I would have liked to stop by again. 
I hope we can visit again during our next trip."}
{"text":"Stopped by to take a break in the middle of the afternoon. They have a good selection of teas, all of which they have a small box of the leaves for you to smell. Tried a couple of the food items and they were pretty good. It's good, though not a place I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place for tea, dessert, and light lunches. Good selection, friendly service, and comfortable (though limited) seating. I especially like how conveniently close this place is to Harbourfront!"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this place and prices here are amazing for such good quality food! The Jamaican patty supreme is the best I've had and high tea for $13.50 including fantastic ice cream is a must! Great service. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food,  tasty iced tea and sinful desserts. The croissants are wonderful and made for great sandwiches. A touch too much mayonnaise for my taste. The salami on a baguette also great. Best was the borscht and a close second was the goulash.
Ice cream was a bit old. Probably the time if year. I will try it again. The homemade scones were delicious. Will come back for high tea but would like some clotted cream!
Peach ice tea was the real deal but too much ice watered down the taste.
Very pleasant and relaxed service.
Very highly recommended! Great value."}
{"text":"This small but adorable shop was lovely. The tea selection is excellent and I love the ability to sniff samples before I made my choice. So good that I bought some to take home. 

I sampled a slice of quiche and rested my feet after tromping all over the lakefront. A lovely cozy spot to enjoy a quiet moment. The staff was present but left me to my own devices...a good signal on their wifi. 

I wish I had made it back on the weekend for their high tea."}
{"text":"If you like tea this is the place for you. Coffee is average, but the fresh croissant was delicious!! Staff was ok, made me a little uncomfortable, but not bad."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised at their soups. The Goulash and Chili come with lots of bread, well priced and great on a cold winter day/night. Give it a shot while in the area or skating."}
{"text":"Definitely a place I would go to again. They had fresh little sandwiches, scones and dessert was ice cream. Tea was served in great little tea pots. The price was right at $15 per person.  Just a little tricky to get to as parking is something for the customer to figure out."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place because I LOVE tea and the area is in desperate need of more restaurants and hang outs, but after several visits, I will only be going back for tea, no food or other nibbles.

The service here is always pretty lackluster. Disinterested staff that don't seem to know much about tea. They also move pretty slow back there, so if there is even 1 person ahead of you, expect to wait about 5-10 minutes before you are even acknowledged or served. The food selection is sparse and none of it is fresh. They make frequent use of the microwave.

The tea selection itself is decent and it gains favour as the only real option for tea lovers in the area. So if you're in the area and you don't feel like having Starbucks, pop in and grab some tea to go. Pass on the food."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of friends and had a really good time. We opted for the high tea, which is an amazing price (it's under $20). I have two food allergies (gluten and lactose intolerance) and had my friend tell the owner when she made the reservation.  The owner was so accommodating. He made me special gluten/lactose treats for my high tea experience. My friends all received the normal high tea experience.

The gluten and dairy free items were fantastic!  The owner made me scones, sandwiches and a seaweed salad. The scones and seaweed salad were to die for. This actually beat my experience at the Windsor for accommodating my diet and hunger.  Then when we were all done we were told that we were allowed to pick any of their desserts. We were surprised and super full at this point. The desserts looked fantastic!  I opted for the lactose/gluten free sorbet. It was the perfect ending to my meal. 

I would definitely go back to the Iron Rose Tea Gallery. The tea menu is extensive and the food is extraordinary!  You also can't beat the price. It is an experience you must try!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both visits have been wonderful! It's an affordable place to have high tea with a group of friends. The service is amazing as well. I always feel welcomed to stay longer.

With the high tea special ($13.50 w/o tax), you get your own pot of tea, scones, finger sandwiches, and dessert (a pastry or 3 scoops of ice cream). As an ice cream enthusiast, I can tell you they have scrumptious ice cream too! 

They have a wide variety of tea!"}
{"text":"Unassuming cafe with small display of art for sale (locally made jewelry and photo prints). Great atmosphere; comfortable, clean, plugs, free wifi, and friendly service. Tough location with the road closures outside, but come check it out! A great alternative to the starbucks and second cup."}
{"text":"Best place for afternoon tea. Were extremely understanding when we were running late because of the TTC (always breaking down). We had reserved for afternoon tea and they easily accommodated us. It was a really fair price and the sandwiches were delicious. We also got to choose desserts from their selection. I would really recommend having some scones and clotted cream and jam as a choice but the French pastries were also delicious. I am surprised it is not more popular (especially on the Valentine's weekend we went) but I suppose it's location is quite tucked away and we had some difficulty finding it."}
{"text":"We reserved high tea package for $13.50, which includes sandwiches, a choice of tea and dessert. I choose the Green Yerba Mate herbal tea and it was smoothing and calming. There was a variety of sandwiches: apple cheese sandwich, cucumber sandwich, salmon sandwich and scornes. Very delicious and the portion was enough for 3 people. For dessert, I got chocolate fudge cake, which wasn't too sweet, which blends well with the tea. The service was good and friendly, but it felt a bit rushed as if they want us to finish ASAP to free tables for other customers. It was a small place that fits only 14 people max."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for afternoon tea! I came here twice last month for afternoon tea and was so pleased with the food and service. For afternoon tea, you have to reserve in advance via telephone. They are very accommodating - my bf and I combined have a lot of dietary restrictions (i.e. no dairy, vegetarian) yet they were so nice (and skilled!) about modifying their afternoon tea sandwich selection. Gluten-free is also an option here, but again you should call them in advance about your dietary restrictions. 

For $13.50 (?) per person we got a huge amount of food! The sandwiches were intricately made - the veggie ones included a creamy cucumber option, apple and brie, and grilled veggies. They also have ham and salmon options for meat/fish eaters. I've also gotten dairy-less, vegetarian sandwiches here and they were still delicious.

Afternoon tea also comes with huge fruity + nutty scones, which were moist yet chewy due to the seeds/nuts, and a dessert (you get to choose from their dessert display up front - lots of cute little cakes, tarts, cheesecakes, and ice cream/sorbet is available too). Of course, tea is involved and they have a big selection to choose from (I must have spent over 10 mins smelling all the teas the first time trying to decide on one lol).

I also see customers get brunch/lunch here and use the space to study. There's not a lot of seating tbh, but it hasn't been crowded the two times I've been here. I don't think outlets are available and not sure about WiFi.

Food 4/5 -- don't expect fancy Shangri-La style high tea, but for what you pay for it's great and there's more focus on savory instead of sweet
Value 6/5
Service 5/5 -- friendly, attentive, accommodating to your dietary restrictions
Venue 3/5 -- a bit small (not good for large groups), but cozy and clean"}
{"text":"Nice place with cool tea-related displays and local art. The owner (I think he is) is really nice and accommodating. My pasteis de nata and doppio espresso were great! I loved the \"hidden\" kind of atmosphere, made it an awesome place to grab a coffee and hide out from the CN Tower/Ripley's crowds, regroup, and plan the rest of our day.

Also I don't know why, but I find the name kind of hilarious when pronouncing each word out loud."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee for real coffee lovers, mindblowing gluten-free mini cupcakes(banana is my favorite one) and great, cozy atmosphere. The staff is always very polite as well. What's not to
love!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Nice little family shop with great coffee and amazing pastry!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for tea and ice cream on our way to the harbor. Everything was so relaxing and welcoming. Very clean and comfortable environment. The two ladies there were super nice and patient with us, since I'm a picky tea drinker. They have Lots of great choices. Ended up getting wonderful loose leave ice tea, perfect for a hot summer afternoon. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Average. Pretty cozy resting place especially when my friend and I went in for a bite while dodging the rain. We ordered a capitchino and an americano. Then a pulled pork and pulled beef sandwiches. All of which with relatively medium big sizing, unlike the aura the name and restaurant tried to brand it as (british iron rose tea place). Overall cozy, small, stereotyped asian cutsie, and fast are the words to describe this little place.
However, if I ever go on to that street again, I will definately go in again for some tea and snacks."}
{"text":"Cute tea shop tucked around the corner from all the hussle and bustle. Tried an iced matcha chai latte but wasn't very impressed. I love matcha but the drink seemed watered down and couldn't really taste the chai. Stop, nice spot to sit and hang out."}
{"text":"Perfectly made vegetarian chili with a side of fresh bread. The tea was tasty, I had peach oolong. Service was excellent, this is a quaint spot for ice cream, desserts, teas, coffee, sandwiches, soups and more! The chili was perfectly done! The right amount of heat! Nice decor, friendly place!"}
{"text":"I wasn't to willing to come to a tea place, but boy, this place was a surprise. The place had Borscht, Hungarian Goulash and Chili...all old school too! They were amazing and so was the service. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It is a quaint hole in the wall but super cute and perfect for tea time! Russian Chai place with borscht and other menu items that go well with a variety of their exotic teas. I had some tiny sweet pastries and a huge cup of peach  tea. Will go back, when in Toronto*"}
{"text":"This review is based on the cup of tea I had at Iron Rose Tea Gallery. 

I did have a high expectation after reading all these 4 & 5 star reviews. 

The tea selection is 4 star, I like that they have 47 different kind of tea available. You can order by a cup or a pot. There are samples with description of tea/fruit/herb blended available in the front so you can smell each tea before ordering.

My Oolong Peach Tea was served lukewarm and I would have love to have the tea leaves steeping a little longer. I was served with just the finished tea but not the tea leaves/bag itself. My tea was too light to my liking and I could not adjust that.

Afternoon Tea though sounds promising at $15 pp. Really reasonable pricing for this hood and maybe worth trying since most people seems to have a better experience."}
{"text":"In the mood for ice cream, I dropped by for a scoop of the chocolate brownie. While a little pricey at $5.09, it was nonetheless delicious!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. The owners are lovely people, the tea is phenomenal (their London Fog latte is my favorite in the city by far), great iced coffee and unexpectedly satisfying ice cream. Plus it's never overcrowded like Starbucks. If you're down by the lake, definitely stop by here instead of Lavazza or Starbucks!"}
