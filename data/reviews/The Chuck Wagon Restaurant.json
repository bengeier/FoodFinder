{"text":"If you are looking for decent food, at decent prices, away from the craziness of the strip, this is a great place to try. 
The food is not gourmet but it tastes good, and the prices are reasonable. I had a 3-egg omelette (ham, cheddar, onions, mushrooms) that came with country potatoes and toast, for $6.99. The omelette was perfectly made, super tasty, and big. The potatoes were tasty, made with bell peppers and onions, however some of them were not quite cooked through and hard. 

My kids shared the \"Monster burger.\" One pound (cooked) of meat, cheese, with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, & mayo on the side. Plus a full order of fries, all for $9.99! I felt the meat was a little bland, could have used more seasoning. But it was by no means bad or inedible. If you an eat everything on the plate (by yourself of course) you get a certificate. 

I've eaten a few things in their menu and everything was pretty good. The casino and restaurant themselves are definitely not glitzy or glamorous, but the food is good and it won't cost an arm and a leg to feed a family (or yourself after a bad night at the tables!) 

The only complaint I have is that they charge  a $2.00 fee to split a plate or box it to go, and they absolutely do NOT allow substitutions on menu items, if you want onion rings instead of fries with your burger, you pay full price for the onion rings and they bring the fries even if you ask them not to."}
{"text":"First time here, I heard the food was pretty good from close friends of mine and the $6.00 steak got my attention . So I thought let's see what the big deal is about this place . First I checked reviews on yelp to see what other have said a lot of  good and a few bad. My time here was good I ended up having the steak with mashed potatoes and gravy with mixed vegetables . And I'll have to say it was pretty good . I'll be making a return visit to see what else is good on the menu."}
{"text":"If impressions/opinions of eateries were formed solely on the food, I would've given this joint 5-stars. Aside from it's location and the seemingly unhappy and borederline \"could-give-a-shit-about-this-job\" waiter we had, I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was for the price I paid.

I absolutely LOVE Ribeye Steak and have had them at many price points at many different restaurants across the valley. The steak here was tasty, tender, and juicy and so was the Prime Rib. I am definitely going back and anxious to try their other menu items. Although only my first time here, I'd say this joint is a go-to for cheap/good eats."}
{"text":"We had seen the sign, $5.99 Steak Dinner, but hadn't gone in -- the place looks so divey, how good could it be? Then we checked the other Yelp reviews -- nearly everyone gave this place 4 stars -- and rightly so.  We visited the Longhorn Casino at 10 PM on a weekday, a time when you'd go hungry at the much larger Sam's Town casino across the street.

It wasn't the ambience -- Wal-Mart has greeters, this place had a hooker almost blocking the front door, begging for $2 because her \"boyfriend just left her.\" And the people behind us somehow managed to have security read them the Trespass Act, photograph them, and boot them off the premises!

The food totally makes up for the ambiance (or utter lack thereof). A lengthy menu features ribs, trout, prime rib, 1-pound burgers, you name it. We had the ribs-chicken-brisket special (not on the menu, on a sign above the cashier); and also the Cajun prime rib. A calendar lists daily specials as well. Finish the 1-pound burger and win an unspecified prize. Creamed chipped beef (\"SOS\") is offered 12M-noon for $4. Steak and lobster, prime rib and shrimp, whatever combination suits your fancy, they have it.  The baby back ribs, brisket, and prime rib were tender and succulent; \"Tell them they have great iced tea,\" says the wife. The bill came to $33 of which $8 was for iced tea and side orders of cole slaw and tomatoes. The dinner rolls were homemade.

Among other things we liked, there's no Bataan death-march through a huge casino to get to the restaurant, the total distance was about 50 feet from car to table; and you don't have to sign up for a casino player's card to get their best deals. Speaking of great deals, they have $2 live blackjack and their rules are more liberal than at Sam's Town (among other things they allow resplitting aces and doubling down after splits)."}
{"text":"Only place in Vegas where you can get a GOOD size lobster & steak for $12.99. Knocking off a star for the neighborhood and questionable clientele."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious food. I ordered the 8oz chicken fried steak and eggs with hash browns. I also ordered a stack of pancakes which were some of the best I've ever had. I ate ALL the food, and also had 5 Miller Lites for under $20 before tip. You can't beat the price for how surprisingly good the food was. Other people in my party got the steak and lobster. Obviously for $12.99 you are not gonna get an 8oz filet, but they all said it was really good. I also ate one of the mini burritos. It was a small deep fried burrito, but it was tasty. I would definitely recommend this place if you are hungry and don't want to break the bank."}
{"text":"I read the Yelp reviews first and they were pretty well on spot. We selected the steak and lobster dinner. My wife's steak was cooked perfectly and tender. My steak had some gristle, but was O.K. The rest of the diner was fine and you can't beat 10.99 for steak and lobster albeit Rock lobster not Maine lobster. The menu is 24/7 and had many items we were interested in trying. I noticed a full page ad this am and it included a 6.99 steak diner. In our 1 and 1/2 years here we have tried many diners and restaurants and most have failed our expectations. We are not picky eaters, but we have just traveled the world and can recognize good food over crap. Both my wife and I cook and have hundreds of recipies from American, International, Chinese and Thai cooking that we cook from scratch."}
{"text":"Food is good and the price is very reasonable. Not the place for you if you are from out of town and looking for a strip casino dinning experience. This is more for locals. The wait to get a table can be a drag, but the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"It took over 45 min for me to get my food!! Horrible. Food was disgusting. The service was horrible. I wouldn't recommended this place to anyone"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? If you want a random place to eat at 2am then here you are! For the price the food is actually pretty nice. Servers are nice and very accommodating. Would recommend to any local here on the eastside."}
{"text":"First time here my friend took me great price food was deliscous they cooked my steak perfect it filled me up just right definitely coming back"}
{"text":"You got what you paid for. 
I had dinner here.  I had fried chicken special. It was only 6:99. It was ok. Edible. But for the price it was very good

The service was great  our server was nice and attractive."}
{"text":"Big fan of the prime rib and the chicken fingers here! The service is always great and good pricing. A go to for me when I'm trying to have a good eat and not spend too much money. Usually have to stop by once a month."}
{"text":"Had my first meal here Tues. 3-11-14 . Ordered the burger w/ baked potato. My better half ordered the steak n lobster special. Burger had a good taste and pattie was a good size. Steak was cooked to order and lobster was a decent size for the price. Restaurant was busy but server or bus person can at least clear the dishes sooner. Left dishes on other tables as well. Prices are good. Will return."}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas or visiting and never been here, it's a must meal IMHO!!  Breakfast Ham Steak and Eggs $4.99 is for two people I think!! Lunch/Dinner Monster Burger $10.99 is for two people I think!!  The bang for the buck is out of this world!!  If you're hungry and want some really good food go straight here at least once and you'll be hooked!!  And they've always had plenty of servers so you won't be thinking you're forgotten!!  Thumbs WAY UP for this place!!"}
{"text":"We went in because of the cheap Prime Rib.  We left liking the place because of the cheaply priced prime rib and the dive casino attached."}
{"text":"Arrive for breakfast and sit there for almost a half hour with half of the restaurant empty tables dirty and three staff member standing out front trying to check out another staff members check. Worst customer service ever the food was not very good I was not impressed the prime rib was not tender as it should have been and the vegetables were mushy and overcooked. We had an amazing waitress she was fantastic she had great service unfortunately for food quality"}
{"text":"The Chuck Wagon restaurant  is inside the casino, and has an old Vegas vibe...not fancy but nice staff and diner fair. Came here for breakfast and a late night dinner. Best part of breakfast is the bacon! The steak and lobster is tasty."}
{"text":"This may well seem an unlikely stop for someone who just did Fogo de Chão the night before. I suppose I could call it an effort at dollar-cost-averaging. 

Really my motivation was that I noticed earlier in the day that Las Vegas guru Anthony Curtis (of Las Vegas Advisor) had recommended their diner deals in a blog, and with quite some detail about his visit on the property. Curtis is huge in the Vegas-insider business; constantly touting unfound bargains (& happenings) in this town ... and so I figured he's wasn't going to high-risk his rep on a joint too easily. So I made sure I passed by it on the way home from errands.

This diner/coffee-shop is inside the budget & locals-minded Longhorn Casino & Hotel, on Boulder Highway, just across the street from Eastside Cannery. I certainly wasn't expecting much in terms of ambiance or upscale clientele ... and I wasn't disappointed in that respect. As example, there was a line of gamers waiting to cash (and likely lose) their paychecks - for which they were entered into a drawing at a chance to double-their-paycheck back. Not exactly the kind of gaming action you see at the Wynn. 

This is a very small casino, so it was a few steps to/from my car to inside the casino, then just a few more to the coffee shop. Good thing, as I don't think I'd want to be dallying too awful long in the parking lot ... or around the casino. The casino smelled very smoky, as in \"old-school\" Vegas smoky, but anything 'old-school' Vegas is AOK with me!

This was on a Friday evening about 7ish, so there was also quite a line for the coffee-shop as well. As you might expect there was a good bit of \"wagon-wheel\" motif scattered about, but most of it was just straight-up ordinary booths, tables, chairs & wallpaper. Service was just barely AOK, though my server mentioned they were running two hands short that shift. (Does that mean they are missing one person or two, I wonder.)

I went with the 10oz hamburger steak plate at $11, that included a small side salad up front, a potato choice, a generous helping of steamed veggies (broc, cali, carrots, squash, et. al.) and a huge dinner roll w/ butter. The salad turned up very quickly, but the entree took a while. I'd say the burger-steak actually came in at 12oz. Nothing exciting here, but the ground chuck was juicy and close-enough to my medium-rare. I'd say the score is that it was much-better-than-average coffee-shop grub than what you'd typically find in this sort of venue and/or price range, for sure. Out-the-door, water, tax, and tip ... right under $15.

Most of the menu choices here fall into the category of diner comfort-food. There's apparently a bunch of deals running 24/7. A $5 ham-steak and eggs plate, with the ham slab the size of the sole on a clown's shoe. (That's quite reminiscent of the deal I used to snag at 4am in Binion's downstairs diner many years ago.) A $13 20oz porterhouse dinner, though it showed as $18 on the menu. And a one-pound hamburger plate at $11. And there was a $6 soup-and-sandwich-de-jour deal. Today's sandwich was 'meatball sub.' I saw the meatball sub ... and it was huge enough to torpedo TWO Subway meatball subs straight into the bottom of the ocean.

I didn't partake, but Curtis said that, for the asking when paying your diner tab, you can get a \"your first card is an ace\" coupon for a $5 wager at the BJ table. (Vintage/old-school BJ at this joint: they still pay 3-2 here & it's a \"Tom\" ($2) table minimum.) This is the kind of proposition that Curtis is always eyeballing for & broadcasting. He makes the odds on this offer as actually in your favor, so that you should take a shot at trying to win back your dinner. (Of course if you win, you have to know 'win to quit.')

This first round visit went well enough, for what it is. So I guess it is now on the list for a repeat evaluation \"if I am driving by that way\" ... as either a quick lunch or as graveyard grub. But never again during prime-time hours, I suppose. Just too much traffic and too much wait.

UPDATE: I've hit this joint three times since the original review, each time taking-on the 8oz. $13 prime-rib deal. Entirely consistent. Each time, the cut looks to be more like 12-14oz. And it's all good. And I am still seeing a lot of other good-looking food moving around the floor. The menu is bursting with great prices. I can't promise you a single drop of ambiance -- it's a solidly blue-collar venue -- but the quality of the food here is five-star as compared to the price.

PROTIP: Park in back and you don't even have to walk through the (little) casino, just up a short hallway, then turn to the left, 15 yards from your car to your booth."}
{"text":"Cane here with family and ordered the $9.99 steak and lobster tail special. It seemed busy, but our wait to be seated couldn't have been more than five minutes. The wait for the food wasn't too long, and the food was definitely worth the wait. Two of the five steaks were undercooked, but one of the waitstaff took care of them and came back with them well done. Service was excellent. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed eating here. My family and I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"My in-laws love this place so we come here all the time. They have cheap specials. The most popular among my family is the monster burger. It's a one pound burger and it's huge! If you finish, they give you a silly certificate. Most people don't finish, but my dad has 2 certificates already. Ha! 

My favorite menu item is the French toast deluxe. It cost $5.99 and comes with 2 whole sliced bread, eggs, bacon, and sausage. I thought it was a good deal and was delicious. Some other favorites include steak and lobster and chicken tenders. Everything on the menu is very decently priced.

The service here is hit or miss. If you're picky about service, don't come here. If you want some good, cheap food, give this place a try."}
{"text":"This once was a great place to eat. Now,   If you like smoke while you dine this is the place.   Prices have went up while providing less.   Such as, they no longer have a salad with dinner entree such as spaghetti.   You have to ask several times for refills.  The night manager has about as much customer service skills as a cockroach.  Watch the food prep area.  No one washes their hands here including the manager on the floors.  Disgusting.  Further, if you want to carry out,  you will be slammed with $2 fee per person. The food and service were good at one time.  No longer true.  With so many other great dining options, this filthy poorly run cafe is a must not do when in Vegas."}
{"text":"We moved to Vegas 3 years ago and have been eating here once a week.  They raised the prices 6 months ago,  The quality has been declining since then.  Tonight we went there again and my wife ordered the country breakfast because they have been burning her burgers.  She found a hair on her plate.  The manager didn't seem to care so we will not be going back"}
{"text":"I have to say that I have had never had a bad meal at this restaurant. The breakfast is fantastic, the credits you get for playing on their machines towards a meal is excellent. The overall drink and food presentation is excellent for a dive. I would recommend this for a place people that are on a budget. I will be eating here next week on my vacation annual."}
{"text":"This has always been our place to eat breakfast and dinner however that has ended. They have raised their prices dramatically. $9.99 for a Cobb salad or any salad is ridiculous for a small local casino. It seems they have raised all their menu items between $1 and $2. I understand the cost of items has gone up but the food is not that great, it's average at best. Well it's been a good run."}
{"text":"I can't say I was impressed. Except I did surprisingly like their chicken soup. It was the only redeeming quality from my meal. 

I go through phases of wanting REALLY good steak - and I can never find any - without having to make it myself. So, I try different places and I am, unfortunately, always disappointed. This time was no different. 

The steak was not well prepared and had little flavor. It was not something I would ever recommend and I couldn't even finish my meal. Gross."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the back of the tiny Longhorn casino along the Boulder strip, the Chuck Wagon is open 24/7 and serves cheap, tasty, diner food. I have a few friends that live close by, so we usually hit this place up after a night out and it always hits the spot. I usually get the chicken fingers and fries for $7 and some change, and my boyfriend gets the monster burger. This burger is a full pound of meat, with all the fixins, and a side of fries for $10. We split the burger and the chicken fingers and usually have some to take home. They have some pretty good dinner specials, although I haven't tried them. They also have specials after midnight for cheap eats. I think the breakfast special is $2.99 for 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, potatoes and toast! I definitely won't go out of my way to eat here because it's super far from my house, but it's my go to spot when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food is quite great, it's kinda small and when I got there to state how many of us there are and that we would want a booth. We waited quite some time when I saw 3 booths open and cleaned. There's lack of organization. 
Also the gaming machines are so close to the restaurant, while waiting for our table two old ladies started smoking and it was penetrating into the cafe. It was horrid to think they allow smoking so close to where food is being served. Overall though, the food is great, and so is the customer service."}
{"text":"Went here 3 times because I love the old small town vegas feel. Food was great and service exceptional the 1st time. Food was good and service was decent the second and third times (both breakfast). 

So I would suggest dinner here over anything else."}
{"text":"Listen, this is not a fancy place. As a guy, it's not a place you want to take a date to impress her, unless you know, she is that odd eclectic type that doesn't really like shaving, is in to 90s grunge music and can identify the grains flavoring your favorite beer. Then and only then, may your date be impressed by your hole-in-the-wall knowledge of how to find good grub cheap. 

This place is tucked into a dive casino, the Longhorn. The restaurant is old and loosely western themed. It is a greasy spoon that seems to never change with the times. It isn't the nicest, cleanest or most convenient. But it charming, comfortable, good eating at a low price. 

The menu is home style \"favorites\": comfortable food with breakfast all day. Over the years I tried basically everything on the menu and really have never had a bad experience. 

Try the cattleman's cut prime rib with Cajun spice. It's my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is super cheap and had good damn food. Seriously we paid 10 bucks for a BBQ platter and it was 35+ elsewhere and wasn't even as good. I got the monster burger and finished the whole thing in under 30 min. Was the best burger I've ever had for 10 bucks. Drinks were good and only around $2-3 as well. The hotel this place is in sucks but the restaurant was phenomenal. Definitely will return here again for the great food and value!!!! All our servers were on top of their game too."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with this place?

Las Vegas, four people, fed for under $60?  And fed *well*?  Sure, off-strip, naturally, but a good cut of beef for a sirloin and lobster tail combo?  And a daily special echilada that could hang with anyone's taqueria?  Bring.  It.  On.

Refills all day, but no Coke so beware.  I'm a root beer fella so no problem with me.  PROBABLY wouldn't recommend the deep-friend mini-burritos, but a good quesadilla and great daily specials.  Fries are done fresh, always nice to see.  Terrific service.  It's in a real low-end casino / hotel but again. not really the point.  Great place to eat, that's the point."}
{"text":"I will never go here again. 20 minutes for a medium rare steak and then when the manager/waitress brings it to me is medium well. News flash not all black people there meat well done. Service was slow and it was not even busy. You have lost a customer due to poor customer service."}
{"text":"Just like my tip for the casino, \"Where is the actual business listing for this restaurant?\" I read most of the reviews and they all say Longhorn Cafe or Longhorn Restaurant. When I checked the place out, there is a big sign right above the place that says \"Chuck Wagon\". So why no one has done a listing is beyond me. The casino itself is a separate entity but when you go over the reviews, about 80 percent of it pertains to the restaurant.

So here's the first offficial review for this listing.

Like everybody else, I was drawn by the billboards off of Boulder Highway about their food specials. One example is the Barbeque Combo Plate for 9.99 which consists of 1/4 Babyback Ribs, Beef Brisket, and 1/4 rotisseried Chicken accompanied by Baked Beans and a mini Corn on the Cob. Another is Steak and Petite Lobster for 9.99 as well. They also have your basic steak and potatoes for 5.99 which is not a bad deal.

I got the Barbeque Combo because the picture from the billboard looked rather enticing. The Babyback Ribs were surprisingly tender and flavorful. The Beef Brisket was ok and the Chicken was a bit dry. All items were topped off with a drizzle of tangy barbeque sauce which I thought was pretty tasty. The corn was your basic corn and the baked beans tasted like it was from a can.

The restaurant itself is a little bit cozy meaning they got a decent amount of tables and booths kind of crammed together. So dont be surprised if you have to wait a bit especially for dinner. I went on a monday at 11:45 am and only waited for about 2 minutes.

As for the service, nothin major to complain about or take my hats off to. You do get what you pay for in terms of service. I recommend you not be in any hurry if you plan on eating here. Overall, the staff is friendly from my first impression.

Some random info: These guys are open 24 hours and you dont need a player card to get the food deals. The bathroom is in the casino to your right when you exit the restaurant. Occasionally you will get a whiff of the second hand smoke coming from the casino, especially if you have a bunch of smokers out there on the slots and tables.

In conclusion, I will definitely come back to try their other specials and most definitely will come here if I have friends or family that just want decent food at good prices."}
{"text":"This is the best Worst restaurant in Vegas.. and I say that with a smile. This restaurant is in the back of one of the most smelly, ugly, trashy casino's off Boulder Hwy and I wouldn't change a thing. Crackheads, Hookers, Pimps, homeless people, bikers, and other assorted charactors are all over this place... and I LOVE IT.

The Chuckwagon has the best food around, and the prices are great. They have many specials.. I like the Chicken Fried Steak special for 5.99 but they have many more. They have a 1 pound monster cheeseburger for 9 bucks. Cant beat that. You so can eat like a king in here for fast food money. 

I took my GF here for her first time and Metro was out front with a bunch of people on the hoods of the squad cars.. AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Awesome. Highly recommended and whenever I am over on that side of town.. I go here."}
{"text":"Showed up late around 10pm looking for food and this tiny coffee shop did not disappoint. Had the BBQ special meal for $10 and it was tasty and tender. Our waitress Jennifer was amazing!!! Friendly, sweet and just awesome. Would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Longhorn casino since I was 13 years old with my great grandparents, although the place is small overall dollar for dollar the food is as good as any place in Las Vegas, many of the people that have come and gone in the restaurant have been great friends over the years and recently have lost a few due to illnesses and tragic circumstances, The waitresses Renée and Cynthia are awesome have known them for a few years they take great care of you while you're there make you feel like you're at home, so if you're in Las Vegas and looking for a place to eat I would recommend the Longhorn hotel and casino the chuckwagon restaurant."}
{"text":"They always have pretty good food, and even when they're busy, the wait isn't too long to get seated. The staff is always nice."}
{"text":"The Chuck Wagon Restaurant inside the Long Horn Casino is good! I went with my parents to try this restaurant because of the daily specials. The food here is very GOOD and DELICIOUS! We ordered many entrées from this place. 

- Steak and Lobster
- Ham Steak and Eggs
- Chicken Wings 
- Finger Food Sampler
- BBQ Plate

I recommend coming here, all the entrées are very affordable and delicious here. The service was fast and nice staff here."}
{"text":"This place used to be decent. I could get good items off the menu and I liked the daily specials. Now I've had to send back all three daily specials I've tried. The pasta is really bland and flavorless. The breakfast special at midnight is very inconsistent now. For the spuds they don't want to put in the bell peppers and onions. The service is not bad but its not good either. This place has fallen from what it used to be. I only get the breakfast special now because you can't really say too much about a $2 breakfast. I wish the old cooks and staff would come back and breathe new life into this place because it's a little tired."}
{"text":"Amazing food at an unbelievable, Las Vegas-casino ONLY price. I had a lobster steak dinner for $12.99, which was amazing (the idea of it lol), but you can probably taste the low-quality of their defrosted lobster. I think their high point is the BBQ. I tried some of my boyfriend's deluxe BBQ dish, and almost cried tears of happiness when I had their super tender brisket. Would recommend this dish ten times over.

This place is perfect and it deserves a lot more credit. 10/10, would come to again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the food here!! The prices are also great, especially late at night/early morning. I just ordered the 20oz porterhouse steak (medium rare) with mashed potatoes, extra gravy, and corn on the cob!! It was cooked to perfection and delicious!! 
THANK YOU CHUCKWAGON!!"}
{"text":"Rolled into Vegas and hungry. 
Longhorn is tiny and not fancy. It's a locals place. If you're looking for crystal vases and linens this is not your place .
Service was good and The food was really good and super cheap . 
Two of us ate breakfast with drinks and all you can eat pancakes ....$9!

This is the place!"}
{"text":"Yummy food!  Decent service.  Great prices!  The only downside is the environment, something about the decor put me off a bit, but that wouldn't stop me from eating there again!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a simple breakfast. My family and I like coming here cuz it's right next to our house. I always order the country fried steak and eggs or the French toast Deluxe both great! Love this place I highly recommended"}
{"text":"I am giving this place only 2 stars because they charge $2 per item if you get take out. That's a rip off. I got 2 entrees (so $4 surcharge so far for that) & wanted to get desserts too but did not because of the $2 surcharge per dessert. That's crazy! The food was decent. The place is a dive. Reeks of cigarettes. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"in the neighborhood and decided on a quick cheap breakfast special. 
the place has an old vegas feel. 
i was seated in 5 mins. 
and my food server was friendly. (cynthia)
the food was great for the price and served hot, fresh and fast!
easy in & out parking in the back. 
place was 90% full. 
ordered the ham steak & eggs special with potatoes/peppers and a side of sourdough bread."}
{"text":"came here to try the steak and lobster for $9.99. no bad. when i got the small casino. i notice that it was not smoky a lot. that's  a plus for me because i was pinching my noise as i went in ha. the rest was straight ahead. we waited a few minutes before the host came and seated us. our waiter was really nice. as we already new what we wanted we gave our orders and a few minutes later our bread came with butter more like a roll. then the entree. i had medium cook for my steak. it was good but reminds me of a more late night special kinda steak with the fats and chewy parts. but the lobster was delish! plus it came with choice of potato. i chose mash potato. all in all the rest was clean. we went late about midnight though the deal is all day. ill def be back and try other specials!"}
{"text":"Food and prices are typically okay. Service is horrible I won't mention the server because I believe management is the problem. The servers can't handle this many tables on a Friday/Saturday night you're a busy location service should be quick when you KNOW what time your rushes are at. Food is very okay I usually send my steak back because it's undercooked but that's typical for this location if you're not very hungry and want to wait a long time this is your place. Let's not mention the fact this restaurant was shut down a couple months due to roach infestation I still decided to come back but the slow service will have to drive me away from this one."}
{"text":"I went here once years ago, and it was so good. The prime rib was perfectly cooked with a nice, fresh baked potato, and creamed spinach. Even the clam chowder starter was tasty. Now it's all terrible, seems like the food has been frozen and reheated twice. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming here and the workers here are friendly. I enjoy their food"}
{"text":"This restaurant inside the Longhorn Casino is the type of place this city had many yrs ago. What I mean is ok-decent food with very low prices inside a coffee shop setting filled with a dull dark reddish light. 
The 10.99 Lobster and Steak was what I had. The smallish cut of NY strip was cooked well and didn't have too much grisel. The lobster tail was humorously small (as expected) but tasty. The french fries were horrible which is odd considering the ease of making a good fry. No seasoning, soggy and blah. Taking all that into account I'd recommend to those not hung up on eating at a foo foo place. Cheap, decent and fast about sums it up."}
{"text":"I'll never order from them again. The bottom of the barrel here in Vegas. Went there two days in a row and the food was different. Complained and they couldn't care less.  Horrific customer service."}
{"text":"Ate here twice last week while I was in Vegas,this place is located in the Longhorn casino. If you looking for a good hearty meal at a good price this is a good place to come to, we fed two adults and two kids for $20.00. First time I was here I got the steak and egg it was under $10.00 and it was pretty good. Next time I came here I order the stampede it was two eggs 3 slices of bacon hash browns with biscuits and gravy or pancakes I chose the biscuits and gravy for $8.99, it was well worth it , it was good and at a good price. Only downside to this place is you got to walk through the longhorn casino to get to the restaurant area and it's real smoky but this is Vegas."}
{"text":"6.99 breakfast steak and eggs!
Over medium eggs, medium steak, sour dough butter toast and camp spuds"}
{"text":"Really tasty and affordable diner food. I do prefer this to most chain diners.

It's not the ABSOLUTE best but they have a nice variety.

I've had the Cajun prime rib once and the fried chicken dinner once.

The prime rib is pretty thin. I wouldn't get it again but the seasoning was good. Their mashed potatoes are really good.

The fried chicken was really good when I got it. It has a nice crust, is seasoned well, and it comes with 4-5 pieces. I think it's half a chicken. Oh & 2 sides! 

The place gets busy. The weight staff is very efficient as it is always busy.

I've also had their chicken fingers and wings with friends and we all enjoyed them. Their wing sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"Place has gone down hill so badly.

We asked for a booth but the one we were given was so cramped up we asked to be moved and the cashier said we were not allowed to. Umm ok. 

Service is something in the past I guess to them. We had to track down our server just to get 1 refill. Other tables around us were getting really good service but not our table.

We got our check and my husband went up to pay and we were going to split the check but the cashier said she couldn't. Shouldn't you know how to do that, it's your job.

No tip
Not a good rating

Avoid this place unless you want to be treated like crap by people who don't give a crap about customer service."}
{"text":"As I walked in the casino I didn't get the normal wall of smoke I remember so that is promising! Checked in with the cashier (Amanda) she was busy with a customer and then attended to me and got me seated right away.
 
They have Pepsi products here, so you coke lovers you \"SOL\" (Sh*t Out of Luck), got me a Dr. Pepper and I'm fine.

Renee was my waitress and you can tell she's been here awhile, you can just sense the wanna be here attitude. But hey we gotta survive right!?

Breakfast that was ordered was the Chuck Wagon Stampede, a lot of breakfast for the money, ordered bacon crisp and it came just how I asked, order eggs over easy and I had the option of Pancakes, Toast, or Biscuits and Gravy. Our waitress ( Renee ) asked if I wanted Tabasco and ketchup I said yes, I knew we were trying to ration water in Southern Nevada I did realize ketchup was included in that as well! ( See attached pic ) 

I went for the Biscuits and Gravy, they were pretty much lack luster. I'd opt for one of the other two, can't really screw up either one of the other choices.

I walked out and my clothes weren't coughing so that is a good sign they have the smoke issue under control.

I will come again, I'm sure if I make this a regular place it will increase to 5 stars as my street cred gets better in this place...."}
{"text":"My wife and I come during grave yard hours on a regular basis. The food and the service is way better than dennys or IHOP or any other 24 hour place I know. I like the ham steak an eggs, pot roast sandwich, Prime rib, breakfast burrito. Those are all winners. My wife likes the steak out which is a small steak w potatoes and veggies, and the chicken wings. The servers are nice and compotent."}
{"text":"Great late night grub for reasonable prices.
And the reason why I say late night is that's about the only time when the place isn't packed. They serve a mean stack of pancakes and their prime rib special is a steal as you'd pay so much more elsewhere for the exact same fare. So the atmosphere is diner greasy spoonish but the food is good"}
{"text":"The Longhorn casino is a little scary when we first walked in. 
At the very back of the casino is the Chuckwagon Cafe. It is pretty small, but a nice quiet atmosphere. 
They have a daily special, but we ordered off the menu. 

I asked the waiter what was good and he suggested the prime rib. So I ordered it med with a side of mashed potatoes. 
The prime rib was good and cooked right, but nothing that would make me come back any time soon. 

We also had the chicken tenders which were very crispy and decent, and the lobster and steak special, which was also decent. 

Now the dessert was pretty good. We ordered a chocolate pudding and a coconut pudding. They were mini desserts and only $1.50 each. My family said both were yummy. 

I guess the food was good for the price, but again, I am not coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall country steakhouse. i don't cook and this place is like 3 minutes from my house, so when my wife was pregnant on on bed rest, I went and grabbed take out from here 3 or 4 nights a week for about 6 months.

They have amazing burgers, steaks, prime rib, pork chops, appetizers, and some of the best chicken fingers I've ever eaten.  Their Chicken fried steak is pretty scrumptious too.  Also, they have an actual charbroil grill in the back, so the steaks and chops taste just like they came off the BBQ grill in my backyard.  I've tried their desserts a few times, and they are okay, but nothing to write home about.  Pretty basic cafe cakes and pies plated in a spinning display case.  

Other than their insane 1 pound monster burger, their portions are not huge, but adequate.  Their prices are mostly \"Old Vegas\" low (Like $1.99 breakfasts and $5.99 steak dinners)  They do have a flat $2 service charge for to-go orders.  They claim it is to cover the cost of the extra styrafoam packaging materials and plastic utensils.

The place is clean, but it is in a very old casino, so it has the stale smoke smell kind of permeating everything.  If smoke bothers you, this is probably not a great place for you.  Service is all dependent on who you get.  Some are quick and personable, and some are not so great.  Leon on the graveyard shift is by far my favorite server and he is AMAZING.  

All in all, the Chuckwagon Restaurant at the Longhorn Casino is a great place to get simple country style comfort food at a great price.  For the money, it's one of the better values in town."}
{"text":"Been frequenting this place, since 1998. 
Awesome. Breakfast Specails, daily specials, 
Soups, sandwiches. Burgers ( veggie too) . 
Barbecue platter is best . Good odds on their casino. I had eggwhite build your own  omlette with Swiss avocado onion and mushroom it was excellent and no way because it's 4 in the morning and by the way, staff is just fine. If anything, i appreciate them NOT CRAWLING UP MY BUTT. As is custom with the Strip's   
joints . Oh its called hospitality. Im not appreciative of people messing up my visit anywhere by falling on another trying to make out with my husband or my rumps'"}
{"text":"Excellent value. Solid food quality. Down home. Stick to your ribs. Hole in the wall. Low roller! I would definitely return....after I lose some weight from eating this meal..."}
{"text":"This place is really convenient as it is open 24 hours and inside of the Longhorn casino. I got the steak here and substituted a salad for the potatoes. I was charged extra for the salad (this is alright) but I expected the substitution to be less than I was charged. The steak was a little overdone (I asked for medium but came out well done) but was definitely eatable. I also had some of the ham from my father in law, it was a little too salty for me but it was alright. This place is ok if you are hungry and it is really late or early, I would recommend sticking to their egg/hashbrown plates as my wife got that and she liked it. Overall it was a decent place for a decent price."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this old school Las Vegas restaurant! Food & service is always very good. Another thing I like is that the same waitresses / food servers ALWAYS seem to be here. It's comforting in such a transient town. Cynthia is one of our favs..."}
{"text":"Really good food and even better prices. I recommend eating here but the rooms are in need of renovation badly. It's probably because they only cost 24.95 per night, they should charge more and fix up the carpets and bathrooms in the rooms."}
{"text":"We went to Snaps for a war wonton fix (my favorite), but in some evil twist of corporate bad decision making, they now close at 10. So, with tears in our eyes and grumbling in our tummies, we drove across the street and were lured in by the promise of a cheap steak dinner.

Now, we've been here before, many moons ago, and I remember it being...not bad... When we first landed in Vegas, with pets and U-haul et al, we actually stayed at the Super 8 that was attached for a week until we found a more permanent home. I'm pretty sure we ate here a couple of times, but it must not have left too great an impression. Or, we could have just been shell shocked from the drive down from Seattle.

Either way, here we were, ready to eat pretty much anything. Yeah, the place is a divey locals joint, that's part of its charm. The beautiful man who seated us asked what we wanted to drink. I ordered a glass of merlot and my husband drew a blank. The beautiful man said, \"You want a shot of Quervo,\" to which my husband replied, \"Yes, yes I do!\" We'd had a long day, see...

 Anyway, Husband ordered the BBQ platter, and I ordered the steak & lobster special. Nine freakin' 99 for steak and lobster. Oh, yeah. I wasn't expecting too much, but, still - lobster!

I've been to enough dive joints to know to order my steak at least one degree rarer than what I actually want. Which, unfortunately, is rare to begin with. So, since I can't order raw, I order rare and hope for the best.

The drinks came before we even ordered dinner, yay! Oh, and even better - they were around $2 EACH!

Dinner came stupid fast - before I even had time to forget what I ordered.

And, you know what? It was pretty good. The steak actually was rare! Sure, it was fatty and not the best cut, but, dude - $9.99! The lobster tail was surprisingly substantial. It was also tender and tasty, with lots of drawn butter and lemon. And, dude, $9.99!

The belle of the ball was the loaded baked potato. Cheese, bacon, and a plate full of sour cream & butter with chives. Oh, mama.

My husband's food must have been satisfactory, as well. All I heard was \"narm narm narm om nom nom nom\" I managed to yell, \"Save the bones for the dog!\" without losing a finger.

OK, so not Mon Ami Gabi, but damn good for the price."}
{"text":"Old school friendly atmosphere and great specials.  The steak abd lobster comes with veggies and a big ass baked potato"}
{"text":"Hands down the best midnight food in Vegas !! I've been coming here for years. Kevin is AMAZING if you go!! I always have a good time when I come here. :) will always be a favorite"}
{"text":"I have to say, I am actually really surprised by myself that I liked this place as much as I did. 

Going through the tiny casino to get here, you are quickly seated and drinks are quick to get to you.

Now the thing that blew me away was the amount of food given for the price you pay. I mean seriously, they have a hamburger that is literally a pound after cooking! Do you know what sort of evil that is? 

But that isn't what I ordered~hahaha. My friend ordered the chicken fried steak and I just had a simple steak with veggies. The portions were amazing and the whole meal ended up costing us less then $20. Its really a great Hole in the wall and I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped by here late night with a couple of friends. Ordered the french dip which was amazing, a couple friends got the steak and lobster for 12.99. Cant beat it good deal, had a bit of order envy. Service was a bit slow but a good overall experience."}
{"text":"There are separate entries for the Longhorn Casino and for the Chuck Wagon restaurant. I wrote a longer version of this review under the Longhorn entry. Why? Because people should know about this place, dammit.

***

The Longhorn Casino itself is very much 'old school' Las Vegas in the truest sense in that it is a dank, dark, smokey dump. There are a lot of (decent) older video poker machines crammed in here along with some blackjack tables that you have to practically dodge around the moment you walk in. 

Your first thought will most likely be, \"Fuck this!\"

Just keep moving ahead. The place is tiny and you can see the sign for the Chuck Wagon Restaurant right when you walk in. Make a beeline for that unless you want to try some very cheap blackjack with inexperienced dealers who might overpay you accidentally. 

The Chuck Wagon itself is decorated in sort of an Old West style, with pictures of wagons and John Wayne all over the place. Not that it matters all that much, people aren't here for the decor. Considering that the place is basically a cross between a family restaurant and the typical casino diner, the menu is surprisingly large. They have everything from salads to lobster to a full breakfast menu available 24 hours. There's also the famous steak special. It's not listed on the menu, you just have to ask for it. I believe it's still $5.99. They also advertise the Monster Burger for $9.99. You get a certificate proudly proclaiming your gluttony if you finish it. I've eaten here dozens of times and I've never seen a single person order it but I guess somebody must. The normal burgers, by the way, are pretty great for the price and they are very large plus you get a ton of decent fries. You will not leave hungry. Other items I'd recommend off the top of my head: the fish and chips, the cobb salad, just about anything on the breakfast menu and something they call the pot roast sandwich which is similar to the prime rib sandwich only much more awesome despite the name.

The best part is, even though the prices have gone up a little over the years, two people can eat very well here for under $20. Yes, a couple of the entrees break the $10 mark but if you're looking to spend that much then why are you eating here to begin with?

A few other thoughts. 

Even though the casino is old and smoke filled, the odor of cigarettes doesn't carry over into the restaurant. I'm a non smoker, I can't stand the smell of cigarettes while I eat and it has never bothered me once at the Chuck Wagon.

If you show up at the wrong time, you may be in for a long wait. This place is very popular with the locals and you can end up waiting an hour if you chose to arrive at noon on a Sunday so plan accordingly. If you do have to wait you can always spend your time losing money on the penny slot machines. 

The coffee is bad. Don't waste your money if you are used to anything better than Folgers. Unfortunately, the water doesn't taste much better. If you want anything with booze in it, they can flag down one of the support-hose wearing cocktail waitresses from the casino floor. I'm fairly certain alcohol isn't listed on the restaurant menu.

The waitstaff is usually very friendly but they are often busy and understaffed. Sometimes it can take a while to get your food. Be patient because it is always worth it. I've been here many times and I make everyone who visits Las Vegas go here. I've very rarely been disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was good. Old fashioned diner food. Came fairly quickly. Problem was the service. Saw our waiter to place our order,get our drinks,get our food and get our check. Didnt ask if everything was ok didnt get a single refill nothing. When we mentioned to the manager that the food was good but the service was horrible and he said at least something was good. Would probably visit again because the food and price was decent and maybe the server was having a bad day but for the manager to have that attitude isnt cool and means I am not willing to try the service again, obviously service isnt important. One other note, we went during a busy time and its extremely loud in there."}
{"text":"Yeah its in a little casino..but for the price you cant beat it..huge portions.  Everybody is friendly and your not being served by a robot. Just the location sucks but if you want good cheap eats this is the place to go..better then denny's a block down"}
{"text":"It's about time I wrote a review for them. In short, they're one of my favorites. Comfort food in a restaurant.  

I usually go for the Steak Dinner Special, served 24/7 for 6.99. Comes with about a 4oz or so steak, veggie and your choice of potato and dinner roll. The special used to come with soup or salad but when the price went up they nixed the salad. I still get my salad, with ranch. Just a basic house or dinner salad. 

Their burgers are also tasty and they even boast their own \"Challenge\", The Monster Burger. It's a one pound burger patty set upon special made buns from Great Buns Bakery here in Vegas. 
Comes with all the fixings and a side of fries. If you take the challenge, you must eat everything on your plate, I believe in under an hour. If you do, you get a certificate.  No other incentives, just bragging rights. 

Also, their Club sandwich is pretty good. I know, how hard could it be to screw up a Club. (It's been done, trust me.) They use beautiful carved Turkey.  Sandwich bread, toasted to perfection and your tomatoes don't cause a landslide. 

Service is always good, Just bare in mind If you go when they're busy...it may take a little extra but they haven't forgotten about you so just enjoy your sit down time."}
{"text":"The Chuck Wagon is the only reason anyone should step foot into Longhorn Casino.  The Chuck Wagon takes up a good portion of the Casino as it should. The food is decent and the price is even better.  My go to meals here have always been breakfast items.  The Stampede is my usual... eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast.  But, the real reason we come here is for the S.O.S... My father, a retired Marine, thinks it to be really good.  If he doesn't know what good S.O.S. is, who would?

The service has always been above par.  I take away a star because you have to walk through a smoked filled casino.  And, there is always a wait."}
{"text":"We've gone 2x now and won't be going back again. The first time, it was decent but the steaks were way overcooked. We decided we'd gove them another try and order our steaks rare. The second time, it was a 20 min wait to be seated, another 15 for the food, and when we got it, the steaks were way overcooked again, even though we ordered it rare. The veggies were soggy, the lobster was rubbery. My son, who eats anything you put in front of him, took one bite of his grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. Then we go up front to pay, it takes another 7 mins for someone to come ring us up. She asks how it was and we told her it was awful, she said \"sorry, $34.24\" we should've just walked out, I wouldn't have felt guilty, it was disgusting."}
{"text":"This is just  a bad  example of customers service are waitress Jennifer told us she was sweating while we were eating after we were  waiting for silverware  and water most of the evening  the food was  tough  and  my stomach felt like  you know what after"}
{"text":"We have stopped at this restaurant inside the Longhorn casino many times for there cheap
breakfast specials when we are in the area.  We were on this day and knowing that the ham steak is so large that it fills the plate we asked for a second plate when the waitress brought the food.  She proceeded to tell us there would be a $2 charge for a second plate.  Really, are you kidding me??? We all kind of looked at her like WTF!  So we just used the Toast plate to cut up the ham for Uriel to have a few bites as he just was not hungry.  I had the CFS which was cooked perfect and always one of my favorites.  We will continue to stop here when were in the area just found the $2 plate charge a little much."}
{"text":"This place right here...Let me tell you, The food is great, the prices even better. I usually get the steak and lobster tail for 9.99 or the 8.99 prime rib dinner. I am never disappointed. normally there is not a long wait. usually 20 minutes at the most. service is pretty fast. This is my go to place!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Longhorn for almost 20 years. 3 years ago my husband and I went there for dinner. He decided to have the monster burger. When it came, he started to take a bite and I noticed the entire underside of the bun was moldy. The was no way the cook staff didn't see that when they made it, yet they sent it out anyway. Since then my husband has been known to all the employees as \"the one\". Oh, you're the one? Oh, that was you? It was quite a story. Then, 2 weeks ago we went for dinner and there was a cooked cockroach in my husband's vegetables. I think we are done now. It's too bad, I love their Cobb salad."}
{"text":"This is a Hidden Gem in a old Casino.

I have to say we would never have gone into the Longhorn Casino if someone did not tell us to try this restaurant. 

The only down fall is you have to walk through the smokey casino to get to the restaurant.
The restaurant you will not have the smoke like in the casino.

The specials they advertise are very good, The prices for anything they have here is great!
We have always enjoyed the steak special. It is always really good, Everything we have ordered was good.

The staff is always really nice. We have always enjoyed going here.
If you can get past the smoke you will enjoy the food, Its nothing fancy but you do get a lot and its well worth the prices they ask here,
We would for sure keep going back! Its good!"}

Most employee's dont look happy to by there.

{"text":"Food here is great and great value, line out the door most of the time, but not a long wait, pictures of John Wayne and playing Clint Eastwood music. This is old Las Vegas and hard to find now a days. Love the wooden steps into the casino. Looks like a fight will break out anytime in the parking lot. Really good food specials!
I love this place."}
