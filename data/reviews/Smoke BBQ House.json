{"text":"We've walked by this place a million times and finally decided to drop in. Awesome! 

Disclaimer: If you're some kind of new age-vegan hippie-'like' meat is 'like' so gross you won't like this place....so stop reading. 

The place has got a really cool vibe. Especially at night. It's got a really sweet biker bar/NYC/Brooklyn feel too it. There were groups of 20 somethings, different couples, some Bay street dudes...a real mix.  

We each got the #1 Sampler and the portions were huge. We thought the prices were fair. Definitely recommend pulled pork as one of the mains. Really liked the South Carolina sauce. Good selection of bottled beers and a few different ones on tap. 

Service was great. 

From reading other reviews on the joint I think they've worked out some of their kinks. We will definitely hit this place up again."}
{"text":"Just visited during their opening week.

Nice classic fit out - simple wood, dark, atmospheric, interesting light fitting on the ceiling.

Some teething issues with getting the food out - we waited longer than usual - but understandable in their first week.

Am not sure if 3-stars if because I don't like smoked food or it really was average.
We were warned by our server that the food is smoked so comes out a little dry and cold. He was right.

Smoked chicken wings - nice flavour in the dry rub but the meat little dry.
Sampler plate for 1 - we had the corn beef brisket and side ribs
- brisket was a tad too salty for me
- ribs a bit too dry

The stand out sauce was the sesame aioli - great idea. Asian take on mayonnaise.
Waffle fries also a great idea - improves the surface area for sauce!
Coleslaw - standard, nothing to write home about, try something else.

We had a really friendly server, and I think they gave us closer to 2 lb of wings than the 1 lb appetiser to compensate for the slow food service.

Maybe give them a few more weeks to find their feet before trying!
Personally, I prefer my food to come out hot and meat to be juicy.

Price is reasonable - around $20 for entrees (including tax and tip)."}
{"text":"Really want to give this place more but was pretty disappointed. I've been to the smokehouse in Detroit that inspired this restaurant and it doesn't even come close.  

We had three dishes, the ribs, brisket and smoked fish and all of them were dry. The sides were ok but didn't really add anything to the menu. My beer was flat and they didn't have another option on draught as they'd run out.

I'll be back in a while to check if the place has figured out it's teething problems as it's a great atmosphere and can see the idea behind the place working out if they just nail down some of the dishes.

2.5 overall"}
{"text":"The food was good, the atmosphere was really laid-back and pleasant, I just wish this place was also a bar!

This area is just aching for a neighbourhood joint, and Smoke is one of the few places big enough to pull it off. They wouldn't even need to change much, just add a few bar tables and some booths on the far wall."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ flavour.  Simple, unassuming environment.  The Texas brisket was a little dry and the chicken very plain but the pulled pork was the bomb and the sauces were great.  Nice sides except for the slaw which was cabbage with a bit of vinegar and salt."}
{"text":"Interesting and tasty sauces. 
Great portion sizes.
Very good bbq meats. 
Service was good. 
Overall a very good experience. Not sure why others are reviewing so poorly."}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars

In the interest of full disclosure, I should preface this review by stating that I used to live in Texas and ate a lot of barbecue while I was there. That having been said, I also drank a lot while I was in Texas and I don't remember with full clarity what the barbecue tasted like there. I just remember that I liked it a lot. I mean, A LOT. Long story short, I'm comparing Smoke BBQ House to other restaurants in Toronto (of various cuisines, price points, decor, etc.) and not Texas BBQ joints.

I ordered the sampler for 1 and tried the Texas-style brisket and the corned beef brisket. The Texas-style brisket was pretty dry, tough, and lacked flavour. I tried eating it with the various sauces but they didn't really do it for me. They were all a bit too sweet for my taste. I should add that good brisket shouldn't require any additional sauce at all. 

The flavour of the corned beef brisket was quite good and I enjoyed the consistency as well. I didn't feel the need to put any sauce on it. I did find the meat to be on the salty side but it was otherwise quite delicious. 

I shared my sides with a friend. We had waffle fries and collard greens. The waffle fries were delicious but, then again, I've never met a waffle fry that I didn't like.  I enjoyed the collard greens as well although I found that the entire thing clumped together, perhaps due to dryness or having been on the cooler side (I stuck a fork in the bowl and picked up all of its contents. \"Hey! More for me!\" I exclaimed to a disappointed friend). I ended up giving her some of my forkful and she didn't love it. That could just be a matter of personal taste.

The service was friendly and relatively quick. The ambiance was nice though a bit ritzier than I would like for a bbq place. It just didn't FEEL bbq. Candles on the table? I'd scrap those and kick the lights up just a notch. 

Note to the restaurant: I think that this place has real potential and I will definitely come back to try additional menu items. My suggestion would be to work on the smoke, bark, rub, flavour, etc. and deliver meat that is honest and pure: no sauces!! If you owned a steakhouse, you would be horrified if a customer asked for ketchup for their ribeye. Right??"}
{"text":"Went last night to celebrate a birthday. We ordered the sampler platter for 2 ($35) with pulled pork, veggies and the Texas brisket, mac and cheese and potato salad on the side. The portions were good sized for the price. The servers bring 3 sauces with basting brushes with your meal. The food tasted outstanding. We ordered an old fashioned and a whisky sour both with bacon infused bourbon, the drinks were amazing, and the bartender even came to our table to say hello. 

The service could not have been better, our server was super friendly and knowledgeable and the owner came over to see how we were enjoying everything. 

We were there on a Friday, and it was pretty busy by 8 so I would say definitely make a reservation as it does fill up on weekends. 

Of all the BBQ places opening up in Toronto, Smoke is the one to try. The ambiance is upscale and trendy, without being overpriced. Service was great. No complaints at all just a really great restaurant experience!"}
{"text":"mmmmmm. Yum.

I liked the atmosphere.  The service was non-obtrusive, the guy seemed laid back.  Mac and cheese was rich and hot, even after sitting out for a while.  Collard greens weren't sour, but crisp and delish.  Coleslaw was light.  Wings were too dry and for some reason seemed really spicy.  Ribs I liked a lot, and the pulled pork was really good!  Overall, lots of food, fun to share.  Will be back!"}

I made homemade ribs the night before, but my partner in dine (out of a few options) decided that he wanted to have BBQ again.

Smoke is only a few weeks old and is located in a no-man's-land on Harbord Street with the only sign of life being the busy Ici Bistro across the street.  

The restaurant itself has quite a cool interior with a deco-wall made entirely of old newspapers.  It reminds me of a pimped out version of a lunch hall at summer camp with a lot less lighting.

To drink I ordered an Old Fashioned (a really STRONG drink - what I would call a man's drink) and a Dark + Stormy (which I ended up swapping my OF for).  

We ordered the sample for 2 (choice of 3 mains + 2 sides).  

Smoked Chicken - I don't think chicken is ever supposed to remind me of tuna.  The texture was almost grainy which I think points to it being DRY and therefore overcooked.  The skin was flavourful, but chewy as opposed to crispy.  

Baby Back Ribs - Great texture, zero flavour.  Did they even season this?  Fear not, easily remedied with one of 3 sauces provided:
   - Carolina (think mayonnaise-like), slightly sweet
   - Texas (tangy and ketchupy)
   - Smoke (tangy and sweet)

Corned Beef Brisket - The winner of the night for me.  Tender, thinly sliced and a good fat to meat ratio.  Condiments might even taint the taste of the beef and I enjoyed it just as well in the nude.  Rivals the brisket at Schwartz's in Montreal. 
  
Sides:
Mac 'n Cheese - Creamy, cheesy - standard
Waffle Fries - Loved them.  Think tic tac toe board meets Ruffles chips - that's how they're shaped.  They were well-seasoned and in my humble opinion a great way to consume taters.  

The service was lacklustre.  No enthusiasm, not very helpful when it came to giving suggestions and things were forgotten.  

So my search continues for a worthy BBQ joint in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is now operating as Smoke Bourbon Bar-B-Q House and I've gotta say must have worked through the growing pains since opening because this was very close to a 5 star experience!

We came here on a Friday night without reservations and were able to get a table without challenge. Really dim room with candles on the tables (no longer the communal picnic styled tables as when the place originally opened) which added a certain coziness. Once we were settled in and set with some pints from the small but enjoyable draught list including Sleemans Lager, Okanagan Pale Ale, and Blanche de Chambly, we began to order entirely too much food for the 2 of us.

The mac and cheese was really cheesy and I'm happy to have started my meal with it. Pork back ribs were really fall of the bone but a bit dry. The good news is that was easily solved with the dipping and smothering of the 3 sauces available at your table, all of which were good, not sure which one I ended up liking the most. Pulled pork was tasty and a large helping, which was especially good when stacked on top of the corn bread or waffle fries, and then drizzled with cheese sauce that was an upgrade option with the waffle fries. Smoked half chicken was easily forgettable but adequate. I also have to commend them for their cornbread, although the portion isn't the best value compared to any of the other sides. Really wasn't a fan of the collard greens.

4 pints and a whole lotta food for $90 post tax / pre tip is a winner in my books. 
See you again soon, Smoke!"}
{"text":"We looked forward to having barbecue at the newest BBQ restaurant to open in Toronto. It was a soft opening so we did expect there might be some difficulties. Were we right?! We were warmly welcomed and quickly seated. I had not expected to be seated on individual benches with no back. Just what I needed for my chronic back problem. Also, there were coat hooks on the wall quite a distance from the table which I could not watch during the meal. So with no back to the seat and a jacket full of keys, a phone and my Garmin, I was forced to lay my coat down on the floor. It is a simple one page menu with such small print that I was unable to read the menu by the light of the candle on the table. I had to use my Garrity LED flashlight and even with this the menu was still hard to read.
Are you licensed, I asked. Yes we have beer and wine. We have... (no beer and wine menu available). We ordered beer and a glass of wine. Unfortunately after the fourth beer was mentioned, I couldn't remember what the first one was.
We ordered Baby Back Ribs $25 and the \"Sampler for 1\" $19 (with Texas Style Brisket and Pulled Pork). Each entrée came with two sides. We ordered Mac 'n' Cheese, Coleslaw, Baked Beans and Sweet Potato Fries. As individual side orders are $3.50 a piece, we expected the sides to be sizeable and unusual.
I found the ribs a bit too dry and with very little smoke. The bark was tough and the ribs were a solid slab and were not cut through into separate ribs. I like my food to arrive 'hot' at the table. Like other BBQ places in Toronto, the Baby Back Ribs were warm not hot when placed on the table. The Texas style Brisket was not cut across the grain and was extremely fatty. Not at all what I expected.
It wasn't our night because I found fault with all of the sides. They were hot when brought to the table, but I had problems with each. The baked beans might just as well have come out of a can of Heinz beans. Southern Style baked beans have bacon and chunks of pork or brisket in it and have a kick from Worcestershire sauce, mustard and/or hot sauce. The dressing on the coleslaw quite vinegary and could have used mayonnaise, dijon or plain mustard to give it some flavour other than vinegar. Even their mayo/sesame seed sauce would have been better. I could not taste the Sweet Potato in the Sweet Potato Fries and the red and white checkered paper used to line the container meant that there was very little room for the dozen or so pieces. The less said about the Mac 'n' Cheese, the better. I enjoyed old fashioned KD from a box better.
To add insult to injury the \"Sample for 1\" was charged on the bill at $20 and not the $19 shown on the menu. When pointed out, it took 15 minutes back and forth without resolution because their \"iPad using TouchBistro\" would not communicate with their printer. My last problem was trying to walk down the four steps to the street without a handrail.
It takes years, many, many years to become a pit boss and master the smoking ribs, pork and brisket. It isn't something you learn in a few days or weeks. Executive Chef Tony Gallippi is a \"Master smoker\" which is a certification bestowed by Cookshack, a barbecue manufacturer based in Oklahoma. To earn the certificate, participants undertake a three-day course that teaches the fundamentals of barbecuing with smoke. He may know the fundamentals but he needs a number oif years to master the intricacies.
We might be persuaded to return but only after The Stockyards are closed and we can no longer make the long trek to Whitby and Oshawa for our BBQ."}
{"text":"Went with a REALLY big group (~25 people) to Smoke BBQ House for a holiday reunion. We had a really good time, but the restaurant definitely showed it's signs of being relatively new and inexperienced. I understand since it's only their 3rd week being open but they could do a lot better.

One really nice touch is the way they did the sauces at the restaurant. Every seat included it's own sauce brush and they provide a handful of different sauces. As the dry smoked ribs come out, you can brush on whatever you want on each rib. I definitely could have used a little more sauce at the table.

The ribs were a little dry and the beer they have on tap is a little expensive for what it was. I think it would be really great if they would bring in a couple cheaper beers.

At the end of the meal we spoke to the owner about the few issues. He said he'll talk to his chef and make sure we have an excellent experience the next time we're there. There aren't enough authentic bbq places in Toronto so I really like the concept of Smoke BBQ house. Next time I'm in Toronto, I'll definitely give it another shot and hopefully up my rating."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Them portions redefine BIG! :) Probably one of the best-valued (BBQ) meal in town.

JTFC, you could easily feed a small nation from this kitchen! My DCs and I came on a bustling Friday night famished, and probably left with refeeding syndrome (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refeeding_syndrome). 

My DCs ordered the TEXAS STYLE BRISKET which came with five massive cuts of tender, juicy and fatty meat. It was pretty incredible! The PULLED PORK, however, takes the prize for the most massive portion I've ever had in Toronto! They filled the entire board with pounds of saucy pulled pork (see picture) that was exceptionally tender (if a bit salty). They offer 4 kinds of sauces on the side, and while the BBQ purist may shun these, I quite liked their SWEET FIRE sauce - gave things a real nice kick to 'em.

And these were just the mains - each of them came with two MASSIVE sides. We ended up sharing their COLLARD GREENS (this is the only fibre you're getting out of this meal!), BEANS (quite sweet-tasting), WAFFLE FRIES (well spiced), and MAC & CHEESE (highly recommended - very cheesy!). Needless to say, none of us were able to finish the meal. Honestly, I'd recommend just getting a SAMPLER (choose 2 mains + 2 sides) between two people, it's way more than enough food.

They don't have a huge selection of beers on tap, but they were decent. I'd recommend their OLD FASHIONED WITH BACON SMOKED BOURBON - my DCs quite enjoyed it and didn't find it the bacon taste quite subtle (this is good!). Finally, our server for the night was perky and attentive. The decor was pretty aite: bench-style tables with plenty of hooks for coats."}
{"text":"After reading a lot of mixed reviews about this, I thought I would throw my 2 cents. 

Beer is normal priced. From 5.50 for bottles to 7 dollar pints. Welcome to Toronto. 

Platter for one is massive. The sides are kinda ignorantly huge. I picked the St. Louis ribs (moist, dry rub ribs. These are not fall off the bone, that's how the Midwest is) and the beef brisket (tasty, however they arrived cold and looked more like roast beef. Had a good smoked rub in it though). Baked beans (a step up from canned) and coleslaw (vinegar based, pretty good!)

Someone said something about being related to tunnel bbq in Windsor... I didn't have the Memphis ribs, but the St. Louis ribs were pretty similar. If only they carried the hot bbq sauce in house...

As for the 3 sauces, I wouldn't bother with the mayo based unless putting it on fries is your thing."}
{"text":"I was really hoping that this place would be amazing because I loves me some good Bar-B-Q but smoke did not do it for me.
The place looks great inside and I do love the atmosphere and the communal tables but the food was just not good at all. Everything we tried (and we tried a lot) was very dry and needed to be covered in BBQ sauce just to be able so get it down. Ribs were so dry and hard to get off the bone, chicken was dry and lacking in flavour, salads were too salty and cornbread was like eating sawdust.
On strictly a food level I would have given this place 2 stars but the atmosphere in smoke is great so I'll stick with the 3.
Hopefully they find a better chef that can rock out some real BBQ"}
