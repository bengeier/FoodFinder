{"text":"Our group was very hopeful a viable good supper club had returned to Sun Prairie since the closing of Herremans.  Alas we still are waiting. We decided to try a Monday night to avoid the crowds.  Unless the service and food take a dramatic turnaround no night will be very crowded. 
We were right, Monday night , not much of a crowd and immediate seating. We immediately ordered drinks.  It was an omen of things to come.  It took almost 15 minutes for him to return. Three of the six drinks were incorrect and had to be sent back. Before we sent the drinks back we informed him we were ready to order. He told us he just got a table of 4 and would return shortly.  You may have guessed, another 10 minutes or so passed before he returned.  One of the drinks still was incorrect but decided to take what we got.  Another person brought out some cheese and crackers and thank goodness or we may have had to call Jimmy Johns to tide us over.  
Our table had several questions about items on the menu.  The waiter did not have a clue.  Every question was answered the same \"I should know that but I will check\".  Rather than risk not seeing him again, we moved on and ordered items on the menu that both he and we knew.  We were gluttons for punishment so ordered another round of drinks, if nothing else for the fruit and olives for something to eat. It got better, only one drink was in error  this time although it was questionable whether the bartender was putting any spirits in the drinks. It turns out 3 of our party ordered the shrimp this evening. Now 10 minutes after putting in our order a different waitress approached us and informed us that they only had one shrimp dinner remaining.....seriously, one shrimp dinner, 10 minutes after the order and you did not know it when you took our order. Can't get any worse, can it?  Two of our party switched to the tilapia, and the longest day continued. 
It bordered on the absurd the length of time it took.  After 30 minutes two different times members of our party lassoed the waiter and asked what the delay was.  There was that pesky table of 4 he had that he had to check on prior to seeing about our meals. He assured us the food would be up shortly.  What we didn't realize was that SOME food would be up but not all.  1/2 of the orders were served, although one person only received her side and not her entree.  Fully 5 minutes later 2 other meals showed up leaving one still with her side only.  When her entree finally arrived, IT WAS INCORRECT, not cooked the way she ordered. 
Now the food report, the one shrimp dinner, way over cooked, the tilapia, a boiled piece of leather had more taste, the steak not even close to how it was ordered but afraid to send it back for fear we would still be there, the salad bar, fine, although
pate without crackers, really!
A waitress came over to tell us that it was the waiters first night as if that would make us feel better. First night and no one is shadowing, no help with the two tables he had, was he working in the kitchen, did he pour the drinks......everything was a disaster.  Her solution..........a free dessert!  Yippee.  Needless to say after 2 + hours we just wanted to get out of Dodge.........unanimous, No thank you!  
No second chance here, to many good places to eat in the area, and this place demonstrated a total failure in service, management, food and drink preparation, and common sense. 
It sure wasn't the supper club we had hoped for and we will continue to wait."}
{"text":"I've been to the chop house on 3 occasions. The first time I came with a group of friends to hear Nine Thirty Standard. The next two times, I brought my 8 year old son. The food was great on all occasions. The salad bar and soups are great. My only recommendation is to make sure the staff and management is comfortable with the restaurant.com certificates. Part of the reason I use this app is because of the easy mobile functionality of the coupons (no need to print the certificates). 

If you decide that the coupons HAVE to be printed, and if there are restrictions on dates and times of use (as mentioned in a previous review), those exceptions should be clearly stated on the restaurant.com website. Otherwise waitresses and patrons are caught off guard and I know that's not the intent. Those websites can be an awesome marketing tactic, so I'd definitely recommend continued use!!  :) 

Otherwise, as I mentioned ... great food. Friendly service - very welcoming and kind to my son - a HUGE plus in my book!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is rated so high on here. We went for fish fry. The food was terrible and it was over priced."}
{"text":"Our first time at this restaurant - and it won't be the last!
Thanks to Kevin, at the bar, who cheerfully and expertly supplied drinks while we were waiting to begin dinner. Cheese spread and crackers were typical for a supper club - fun!

Outstanding freshness and selection in the salad bar. And loved the warm bacon dressing. 

All five members of our party enjoyed their entrees. It is really nice to have healthy options for sides, too.

Because it was a special occasion, we indulged in dessert. It was difficult to decide between key lime pie and tiramisu, so I sampled them both - and each was great.

Hats off to our server (can't remember his name) who treated us like royalty! 

We will look forward to coming again. 

BTW it is a great idea to have nightly specials!"}
{"text":"I'd give the Water Tower Chop House a 2-star rating if it hadn't been open less than a month.  My wife and I visited on a busy Friday night.  The initial impression walking in the door wasn't bad. Pretty traditional Supper Club, which is what it used to be and in part still is.  It went down hill after that.  I've been greeted with more warmth by hostesses in snooty New York City restaurants.  The entire greeting, after her looking at us expectantly and us giving our name was \"You can go in there (the bar) and have a cocktail. We'll call you.\"  Note this was 6:29 for a 6:30 reservation.  No indication of when that we might be seated.  Our fellow waitees had 6:00 reservations and far more patience than I would have had.   Seated at 6:40 (not bad) the waiter was prompt to greet us, was personable and turned out to be on the plus side of adequate.  One thing that was an immediate disappointment was the fact that they chose to place bussing stations around the dining room.  The station that was my immediate neighbor was well populated with the remnants of previous diners meals, an unappetizing sight. A word to our waiter and it disappeared.  To his credit and financial benefit, it didn't return.  The salad bar contained the average selection of standard bar items.  The spinach and lettuce were fresh, everything else canned.  There were a few other potential offerings like potato salad but all were empty when I arrived.  I had ordered the Lamb Duo, while my wife ordered the Salmon.  After a pretty substantial wait with our water and iced tea being refilled promptly, food arrived.  My wife enjoyed both the presentation and taste of her relatively small portion of salmon.  My lamb was a mixed bag. The chop was tasty and reasonably tender.  This was good because the knife I was provided was a standard diner offering.  It was done to the medium-well level in spite of my request for medium-rare.  The other half of the Duo I first mistook for a silver dollar size mushroom.  Probing with my fork made clear it was meat.  I'm not sure why they bothered except to call the plate Duo.  The accompanying potatoes and asparagus were both tasty and well presented.  For dessert, my wife indicated her strawberry shortcake had been sitting around too long while my flourless chocolate cake was good but wasn't enhanced by the drizzle of canned chocolate syrup.  All in all, not a failure but I'm going to wait a while before returning.  Sun Prairie could use a good fine dining establishment.  This one isn't there yet."}
{"text":"Went to brunch. The food is good (buffet). My only suggestion is that the two men working th he buffet and bar need to stop wandering around, standing in the customer's way, and try being less awkward."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Watertower Chop House and it was simply perfect!  My wife and I both had the NY Strip and they were simply amazing!  The waitstaff was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu items, ensuring that our experience was a great one.  The atmosphere is very low key and comfortable.  The salad bar was constantly attended to, assuring that everything was perfect.  Highly recommend paying them a visit, it is an experience that you be glad to have been a part of."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was excellent!!
The pork chop was done just right the potatoes and asparagus were also very good.the Mahi Mahi and salmon  was done perfectly. The salad bar was very fresh and well maintained everything was tidy.
Will definitely return 
Norm M."}
{"text":"First time visiting a few weeks ago.  It's your typical Mom & Pop supper club with a fabulous salad bar.  The service was good and the fish on Friday was outstanding!  

The interior's a bit dark and dated, but don't let the looks fool you  The food is pretty good, and presents a good value for the $$$.  We'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was crap! Rude waitresses. Slow refills. Would not go back. There are better places to eat in Sub Prairie. Try buck n honeys.
 Was there for my wedding rehearsal Friday January 16th 2015. Sloppy and inattentive service. Very rude to my mother in law until she was the one who picked up the check. Disappointed. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent service, outstanding food. So great to have a classic supper club in town."}
{"text":"We selected Watertower Chop House for a retirement celebration on January 15th with 8 individuals from work.  We ordered drinks in the bar while we waited for everyone in our party to arrive. The bartender was friendly and very attentive to our needs.  The brandy old fashioned sweets were made exactly the way I like them which for some reason I only order when I'm at a supper club. We went to our table and explained to our wait staff that we were still waiting for one more person and therefore would just order more drinks in the interim. The wait staff was very accommodating even though we were delaying ordering food for more than 30 minutes.  We finally placed our food orders and enjoyed the salad bar with a huge selection of salad ingredients.  The Filet Mignon with Lobster Oscar and the salmon dishes were cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the Lobster Gnocchi.  We are not the most soft- spoken individuals after a few drinks however the wait staff was wonderful and let us take as long as we wanted for our celebration. This was our first time at Watertower Chop House and won't be our last.  It is so nice to finally have a great supper club again in Sun Prairie.  We'll be returning very soon."}
{"text":"Decided to take some out of town guest to the chop house as we have been there several times before.  We had a party of 7 and showed up at 6:00 pm only to be rudely greeted by apparently the owner as a non reserved party of 7.  After looking us up and down, I felt we were being sized up for our attire??  I have worn jeans and a Blackhawks jersey to Ruth Chris and they kissed my ass on their service.  After checking their very short reservation list (4 names), we were rudely informed it would be an hour wait.  Upon viewing the dining room, I notice 6 tables of 4 that were unoccupied.  Guess they have a rule not to combine tables to accommodate their guests.  When you show up at a restaurant with a small group, they should show some appreciation.  I have eaten at many fine dining establishments throughout this country and this place is far from fine dining and the staff that greets you is extremely rude! If I could give no stars, I would!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we'd go again.  We went Monday for the 1/2 sandwiches but ended up trying the Bistro steak and the shaved prime rib open sandwich. The salad bar was well stocked with good variety. Fabulous Manhatten clam chowder.  Steak was tender & tasty. Prime rib on texas toast with mashed tatoes was yummy.  We split a huge dessert and still took some home.
Nice quiet ambiance with oldies music playing softly.  The bar is separate and had Monday night football on.

See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Visited the Water tower chop House recently on a Friday night, the fish was good, customers and wait staff were friendly,they made a tasty old fashioned but I liked the well equipped salad bar the best! Located in downtown Sun prairie on main street with parking in back"}
{"text":"Just had dinner at the chophouse and tried to fish fry. The breading on the fish was a little too Thick. The  salad bar was very extensive and clean. Tried the Cajun potatoes which were spicy and delicious. I love the clam  chowder. They have a large bar area and  the old brandy fashion was delicious.  Would definitely go back and dine there again. Service was excellent in the bar and the dining room."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night. There wasn't very many people there so we got a nice private table. Server was prompt and helpful, 4 stars there. The place could use some updating, it's kind of dark but to each their own. Food wise, everything was good but could be better especially for the price. 3 stars for food. I ordered a filet mignon; it wasn't cooked to my liking (too well done) and a bit under seasoned, but it was still quite tender. There were also some minor mix up in the kitchen with our sides but our server promptly fixed the mistake. Overall, it was a good weekday dinner. Would have given it 3.5 stars if it was possible."}
{"text":"This was by far THE WORST excuse for a supper club we have ever been to. 
We sat with empty drinks and dirty plates on the table until the entrees came.....an hour later!! 
The salad bar was not even close to what they advertise on their site. 
The breading on the fish was soggy and tasteless. The tarter sauce tasted 'tainted' like it had been sitting out for hours!
  The The sirloin steak looked like a ball of meat, which the waitress informed us is called a 'baseball sirloin'! NOT what it was called on the menu?!?
Everybody got their supper plates except me. When they 'found' my plate, The $30 pound of crab legs, it was absolutely RIDICULOUS!! The shells were soft. The crab meat was literally soggy. So soggy that when I squeezed it water poured out. And the flavor?? You guessed it-was disgusting. The butter didn't even taste right!
NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL and will never go back."}
{"text":"Huge let down and it went like this:

My spouse and I arrived on a humid and hot Saturday evening at 7 p.m.  We were seated immediately, without a reservation.  As we were being led to our table, the first thing we noticed was that the AC clearly wasn't working--it was damp and hot inside!  After waiting about 10 minutes, our server arrived to take our drink order.  This poor guy was dressed in long sleeves and black dress slacks; he had longer hair slicked into a ponytail along with the fact that he clearly hadn't shaven in ages.  And--he was just drenched with sweat.  Ugh.

After we ordered our entrees (prime rib for me, steak frites for him), we eagerly went to the salad bar.  Barely average--Hometown Buffet would've been better and likely fresher.  Everything, and I mean everything appeared to be from a can (perfect little cubes of ham, chicken, whatever) and the most pale, pink, quartered tomatoes.  Wisconsin is full of fresh, delicious produce this time of year; it clearly was not apparent on this salad bar.  Also, no bacon, croutons, garnishments, etc...

When my prime rib arrived, I was pleasantly surprised--the plate looked beautiful, with a nice, medium-rare slice of prime rib along with garlic mashed potatoes and 3 stalks of grilled asparagus.  HOWEVER:  I thought it was very odd that my prime rib came with a liberal sprinkling of salt and pepper that was freshly applied on top.  I cut into it and took a bite--it was not medium-rare.  It was almost well done inside!  Although the top was reddish/dark pink, inside it was gray--like it had been cooked all the way through!  Clearly my prime rib had been MICROWAVED.  It was flavorless.  I ate a few bites and took the rest home for my dog (seriously).  My garlic \"mashed potatoes\" was a baked potato that had been smashed with garlic powder on it.  It was in no way marginally reminiscent of mashed potatoes in any conventional sense.  No creaminess, no butter--just solid chunks of a baked potato. No lie--a baked potato that was literally just smashed up on your plate with an odd garlicky taste.

My spouse, who had the steak frites, fared no better.  His \"steak\" was like the sole of a shoe--it was thin, difficult to cut and full of tendon.  He gave me a bite (I was so hoping his dinner was better than mine) and I could not chew it; I had to spit it out.  He was unable to finish it.  His frites were the highlight of the meal; they were very, very thin and crisp with butter and cilantro sprinkled on top.  

As we were finishing our meal, at approximately 8:00 p.m., we looked around and noticed that the restaurant was completely empty and only two people were sitting in the bar area.  Wow.

The only thing that makes me not feel utter contempt for this place is our poor server--this guy did as much as he could right, but the look on his face spoke volumes.  He clearly knew that this was all sub-standard, but he did his best anyway.  

To sum it up:  This place will be closed soon, just like it's predecessors."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd visit to this restaurant. Service was great, cocktails spot-on, but everything was so salty. Calamari, French onion soup, and scallops. Server was great about taking the soup off my bill. 

I'd go back for the cocktails and the salad bar--leave the kids at home."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday dinner. Had a very good experience. 

Only downside was the salad bar where the bacon was the cheap imitation stuff and the rolls were day old. Otherwise would have given them 5 stars. 

Meat mixed grill was very good and perfectly cooked. 

My son had the perch and it was perfection and accompanied by some great tarter sauce. 

Good sides. 

Great service at the bar. 

Prices were reasonable for a supper club. 

Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Went for the Friday fish and really enjoyed this place.   The salad bar was exceptional, the clam chowder had a tremendous flavor though it should have used a few more clams.   The fish fry was ok.  The perch has a panko crust but it lacked something.  It just didn't have a lot of flavor like something was missing.   The potato pancakes were tasty.    I know perch is expensive but 18$ for a perch fry is a lot though you do get the salad bar and soup.   Overall it seems like a nice place to move into the space that herremans occupied."}
{"text":"Abosultely the worst place I ever ate. I ordered the fishermen's platter anticipating three very large shrimp. They brought me 5 popcorn shrimp an the worst looking fish fry I have ever seen. Fishermen men's plate is $ 32 . Fish was horrible so was the service. Salad bar was good.Drinks were great. I will never eat their again"}
{"text":"Well, where do I start? Yhus was our first time here. The salad bar is what earned the 2 stars, otherwise it would have been 1. I ordered the surf & turf pasta with a white wine sauce, chicken, scallops, shrimp & some kind of fish. My hubby ordered the ribeye.
The salad bar was mostly fresh, except for the cucumber was slimy. My pasta was cooked well, had seemingly fresh veggies however the sauce was a bottled Alfredo sauce instead of white wine. Hubby's steak was tough and not cooked correctly-it was medium instead of med rare. Otherwise service was good."}
{"text":"The Prime Rib was sold out before I could try it.  I did get the filet mignon lobster oscar.  I got it with the asparagus as my vegetable and mashed potato and salad bar.  the salad bar was very hearty.  The Filet was decent and I'd like to go back to try the Prime Rib.  the waitstaff really was good to me."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner at Watertower Chophouse. We'd driven past it a million times and finally got to try it. Was it the most amazing steak we ever had? No. But it was really very good. We were surprised how much we liked it and for the price, can't beat it. We both ordered the fillet, medium and they were cooked perfectly to our liking. Salad bar was great. Service was great. If I had to complain about something, the bread was dry. The atmosphere was very old school super club, I dug it. I'd way rather go here than a chain steak place."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!!  Food is great, service is very good, prices are reasonable and love the salad and soup bar.  Definitely recommend reservations as it is always very busy when we go there.  Without reservations you are looking at a 30.40 minute wait time as they are that busy!!  But the food and the service don't suffer because of it!!!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went on Sunday, hoping to try the cider chicken. Unfortunately they changed the Sunday special to chicken and dumplings. Three of us had the 2-piece special. It came with very big, tender chicken pieces along with two big dumplings (biscuits?) and a lot of gravy. Chicken was very good, but it was somewhat overwhelmed by all the gravy. The salad bar was huge and had lots of good stuff on it, including my fave, hot bacon dressing. We finished off with ice cream drinks -- my grasshopper was good, the others liked their Brandy Alexanders. Although the restaurant itself still looks like Herreman's of the 70s, it's nice to have another restaurant to choose from in Sun Prairie."}
{"text":"We went on Father's Day- super busy but our friend had reserved online.  They had our table ready for us.  The salad buffet that comes with entrees was pretty fresh.  The tomato bisque soup was yummy.  Their were lots of options like regular salad mix, spinach, ham, eggs, lots of veggie variety.  The bacon balsamic dressing on spinach was delicious.  I was full off salad buffet which you can get on it's own for $6.  My entree was the special- cider chicken with two sides.  I got garlic mash potatoes and grilled asparagus- really flavorful.  Chicken was a bit dry but tasty.  My boyfriend got burger with egg and he really liked it- intense flavors.  Service was just okay- server was not knowledgable about menu, gave me dirty take out box and forgot to give us father's day discount.  Another server made up for it by giving our friend's toddler free cupcake."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was excellent, food was good, good service up to the point of paying for our meal.  We used a coupon for $15 off a $30 purchase that our server, Cindy, honored for $13.95 and proceeded to argue over honoring for the actual $15.... Granted it was only $1 but the scene she created and the sarcasric, rude remarks she made make it impossible for me to come back or recommend eating here to others.  The manager did correct the situation eventually but the damage was done."}
{"text":"This was our first visit but definitely not our last! We had a wonderful experience! We wanted to take my husband's mom out for her birthday. We looked into the reviews for Watertower and decided to \"take a chance \". Great decision. Between the 6 of us we had the scallops, crab cakes, calamari, lamb, prime rib, beef tips and lobster ravioli! I highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of those times I wish I could give a half star to the rating, because this place is not a full 5, but better than a 4.
Food, good, really good. 
Decor, classic and feels like home. 
Staff, busy, friendly and willing to make sure you had a perfect meal.
The only reason I wont give a full 5 stars is simply for the reason they need more staff. The waitress we had was running all over the place and had way to many table to deal with. There was only one other person in the room working with her, and she even seemed over whelmed. So getting service right away did take a little while. But when you did get service, it felt like you were the only table she had to deal with for the rest of the night. Super friendly staff from start to finish.
The Friday night fish fry is a classic Wisconsin fish fry; big pieces perfectly fried and lots of sides to pick from. 
There is a good German influence here with the different items you can get. The potato pancakes are killer, and the bacon dressing is good; not an Amish style dressing that I am use to, but more closer to a German potato salad dressing with that good vinegar bite to it.
This is a classic Wisconsin Supper Club venue and one that I am SO coming back to."}
{"text":"When we arrived there was a line of about 6 people waiting to be seated with another 6-8 lining up behind us, and we were a party of 5.  We probably stood there at least 5 minutes before we saw a hostess.  The hostess came back and took a foursome to be seated and we waited another 5 minutes.  She then told the couple in front of us that didn't have a reservation that they were full and could not be seated.  Luckily (?), we had a reservation.  She left and said she would be back.  A man in a blue shirt who never smiled and assume was some sort of manager asked us if we had been helped.  We said we had a reservation, he looked, put a mark by our name, and said he would tell the hostess and walked away.  Seriously?  You see a line of 10 people in your restaurant and you walk away without acknowledging anyone else?  The hostess came back again and did not know we even spoke to that man.  She was frazzled and clearly not having a great day.  She at least smiled and told us it would be just a minute while she got our table ready.  As she was leaving to set our table, the foursome that were seated previously said they were leaving as the restaurant was out of prime rib.  What?  It's 11:20 during a 9-1:00 brunch, how are they out of prime rib?  We discussed leaving but figured every other place would be busy and didn't want to hassle trying to find a new place. 

 Once we were seated we could tell right a way that a server would not be with us soon.  We decided just to go ahead and start the buffet.  The salad bar was unpresentable.  Seriously, who cut the lettuce? Wedge salad is not typically served on a salad bar folks.  There were big chunks of iceberg that we had to cut first in order to eat it.  There were remnants of carrots and cheese, etc all over.  No bread, crackers or soup.  It's probably limited salad bar for brunch, but their online menu does not state that.  The side that usually holds the cottage cheese, cold salads and such held two trays with two pastries and a handful of muffins.  Someone came later with a new tray but that was 40 minutes into our meal.  

Each time any of us went up to get hot food, they were out of something.  Syrup and butter.  How do you not have someone monitoring that?  TWO syrup containers completely empty and butter pretty much gone.  Why bother with the pancakes then?  I noticed those were refilled on my third trip.  You had to make multiple trips as you could only get a few items at a time because the trays were empty.  There was supposed to be chef carved ham as well, but the carving station was un-manned with the end of a ham that nobody wanted.  About 45 minutes after we got there we saw three people in chef's coats working on the buffet.  Where were those employees when we arrived? 

No bartender.  As I was waiting in line to get food, a customer was standing at the bar.  The man in the blue shirt (manager?) asked what he needed.  The guy needed SERVICE.  I'm sure he got tired of waiting at the table for some.  Blue shirt guy then got behind the bar to make the drinks and asked the customer who his server was so he could bill the correct table, again....NO SERVER MADE IT TO TABLE YET.    Ridiculous.

At one point the hostess walked through the dining room saying \"I'm done, I AM DONE.\"   Well that sounds like a great place to work!  This place clearly has management issues.  They were understaffed for the customers THEY KNEW were coming in.  Everybody that came in had reservations.  Did staff call in?  Okay.  Let your customers know that you are sorry that service may not be top notch, but your glad they came in today and please be patient.   Out of prime rib?  Let your customers know that you are working on an alternative and then make sure all the other food on your brunch menu is available, at the same time.  Although, advertising a brunch with prime rib and then running out when you still have reservations coming in is pretty bad.

Out of all of this, I am most irritated with the guy I can only assume was the manager.  SMILE for crying out loud!  You had a restaurant full of people and you didn't speak to any of them.  \"Hi, thanks for coming in, how is everything?\"  \"I apologize this is not our best brunch service, but we had a few people call in\"    Communication goes a long way in customer service.  I want so much for this place to be better.  It could be a fantastic place, but it seems to be just getting by.   I did not see any teamwork today.  Management needs lessons in \"management\".  The guy was doing things but was all over the place.  The hostess was gone for unacceptable amounts of time setting tables and finally refiling the salad bar.  Couldn't a server have helped with that?  It's not like many drinks were being ordered and for sure no coffee was being made as the coffee we ordered was cold AND there was no decaf coffee."}
{"text":"This business has recently done a \"soft opening\" as of last week.  Since I live down the street from them, I'm familiar with the ebb and flow of Main Street Sun Prairie restaurants opening up, staying open for a little bit, and closing, as demonstrated by the previous ownership of this restaurant space  (see this article: http://host.madison.com/news/local/city-life/in-may-watertower-chop-house-brings-the-supper-club-back/article_1fc21e50-4d63-54cc-b93d-eeffdab4de73.html).

It's a Supper Club with a soup and salad bar, main entrees, and dessert.  It's a table cloth, low mood lighting with candle light, and multiple utensils on hand kind of place. 

Everyone in my party of four ordered the Thursday special of the day, the slow cooked BBQ ribs.  It came with multiple options for a side, I chose the sweet potato french fries, my companions chose the potato pancakes or the mash.  

Everything including the salad bar was divine. The turtle cheesecake was HEAVENLY.

And on top of that, they know about professional wait staff service.

The test of a great Supper Club will be consistency.  It remains to be seen how this quality will continue, but we can certainly be optimistic about the possibility."}
{"text":"Never Again.  We went to dinner on Saturday night at 6:15 and the waitress told us of the prime rib special  All 7 of us ordered the prime rib some ordered petite cut and others ordered queen cut.  Our prime rib came for 6 of us and you could not tell the difference between the queen or petite the pieces were exceptionally thin and some were not cooked to our liking   Unfortunately my Mom's prime rib did not arrive at the same time as the rest of us.  We waited and waited for the waitress to return to bring her dinner.  After a while we went and told the hostess about the situation, she disappeared and did not come back.  Then we went to another waitress and told her.  Finally her dinner came and it was the end of the prime rib and it was black.  At that point we had waited so long, the rest of us had all finished eating when my Mom's dinner came out.  We looked at the piece of prime rib and said she is not eating that.  What is going on?  At that point we learned that they had run out of prime rib. How do you have a special and run out and not bother to tell your customers??  That explains why the pieces were so thin and why we received an end piece.  At some point the cook came out to apologize and asked what he could do to make it right.  At that point not much could be done.  They did not charge us for my Mom's dinner and they took a percentage off of our bill, but the whole experience was a disappointment.  I am sure the pieces were cut very thin to accommodate the fact that they were running out.  NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"The first impression when we walked in the door was not good. For lack of better words the hostess was dressed very slutty. Super high heels and a dress that barley covered her butt. Not the imagine I'd want for a restaurant like this. Also, not very smart. We brought 3 small children in with us and she asked if we needed kids menus. Umm.... Yeah?? Duh!! So onto the waitress. Very nice. Not super exceptional service but she was efficient and earned her tip. As for the food. The salad bar was good. Slightly better than an average salad bar in a restaurant. We ordered calamari as an appetizer and was disappointed. Very bland and no flavor in the breading. And where is the lemon that I've always had come with any calamari I've ordered? I ordered the chicken and spinach manicotti. It was good. Not exceptional but good. My fiancé ordered a Bloody Mary (not the greatest) and the whisky bourbon pork chop (no complaints) and I also tried a little piece of my kids Mac and cheese pizza and it was good. The prices are a little high so unless someone else suggests coming here I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went for Dinner Saturday night 7/10/2016 , we sat at the bar for some cocktails before dinner was served by Kevin the bar Manager - excellent service- conversation and very good cocktails Canadian Club Old Fashions .
Kevin said we could eat in the bar area as they have tables so we ordered right there my wife(Linda) had a Ribeye and I had the BBQ Ribs both were very tasty will return soon especially for the Brunch."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Major improvement in quality and staff from previous businesses there. Bartenders are great and set the stage for a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last Friday night and it was a good time.  We arrived early for drinks in the bar...the Old Fashioned Sweet was spot on as was the scotch and soda.  They were strong but not too strong, you could tell you were getting your monies worth ($5).  For dinner my lady ordered the fish fry($15) and I ordered the mixed grill ($24,) which is comprised of three different kinds of meat, and was told they were out of lamb chops so I ordered the all you can eat fish fry ($14).  The fish was very good, nice big pieces, as was the coleslaw and mashed potatoes.  My girlfriend had the salad bar and enjoyed it but said she's had better chowder.  I guess the potatoes were kind of hard?  Anyway, I loved the fish but what I didn't love was the margarita I ordered with dinner.  When I ordered it the wait staff asked if it was okay that it was made with a mix.  I said yes expecting it to taste like a margarita....I couldn't taste the tequila in it....it kind of tasted like a too sweet limeade?   Anywayz, I do not recommend the margarita.  I did like this restaurant, the staff was wonderful, and the food was delicious.  If I could ask anything, it would be to ask that they improve their bar with fun, boozy drinks, and maybe top shelf tequilas and whiskys....some good scotch....etc."}
{"text":"Watertower is an old school Supper Club. I was told that there were a few other places in here that didn't do as well before this place finally ended up here.    It doesn't seem like this place has done much to update the look on the inside because it looks a little dated.  That's fine though because it adds to the charm of the location.  

The inside appears to be sectioned off into a few different rooms.  There is a bar in the front with very friendly bartenders.  I ordered a vodka gimlet and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Our server honestly seemed a bit off that night.  She was pleasant enough but just seemed a little odd.  As it was Friday, I ordered the fish fry with the salad bar.  The salad bar was much better than your run of the mill salad bar.  It was very fresh with lots of different options.  Our food took a while to arrive so that was a bit dissappointing.  When our meal arrived, the presentation was good but there just seemed to be something a bit off about it.  The meal seemed to be lacking in flavor.  If it just had just a bit more flavor it would have been very good.  

Though I did not really enjoy my meal, I am really looking forward to trying a few other dishes here.  The prime rib is supposed to be really good and it may be a place to come for a drink."}
{"text":"Just an ok experience. We were seated way in the back away from anyone which gave us just ok service. The food was just ok. The decor was old and outdated. To be honest the entire experience was just blah. I might have had a different experience if I sat at the bar and had drinks. I would consider several other near by places before coming back here....oh wait thats what I've done already and thats why its closed now."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a low level supper club. The prices were astronomical for the quality of the food you got. The lobster ravioli was cooked from a frozen state, you could tell, it had that rubbery texture to it. It was served with a tomato lobster sauce with large chunks of ham in it ( why is there ham in lobster ravioli??). The fish fry was 4 large pieces of deep fried cod, you could have chosen smaller sized plates of two or three pieces, which I wished we would have done, since I took home two pieces because my stomach couldn't take the grease content in the cod. The cod was overpriced and the potato pancakes were cooked from a frozen state (plus they were over cooked). The fries were also overlooked and very salty. The salad bar was awesome and the service was great. The killer to this meal was the bar manager, Tim, grazing on the salad bar while we watched. When we walked in, he was at the hostess stand and looked at us like a deer in headlights. He never said hi, he just walked away. Not a person that should be working front of house. I have to reiterate that the worst part is, he picked items from the salad bar with his bare hands.  Extremely GROSS!!  I gave 1 stars since the salad bar was good and the service was amazing. If I could rate this place a negative rating I would. If you are looking for a supper club, look for a different location. PLEASE tell Tim to STOP GRAZING ON THE SALAD BAR!!! Especially in front of customers. Our server, who's name I did not get was super. Keep doing what you are doing girl, you are a natural when it comes to customer service."}
{"text":"Very traditional style steakhouse/supper club feel to this place. Decor is somewhat outdated, but I like places like this. Staff are excellent and service is great. Their menu is extensive and they have several great tap beers available in addition to a full bar. Their walleye and perch are delicious on Fridays. They also have great sides, like potato pancakes and grilled asparagus."}
{"text":"We tried the chop house for Sunday brunch for the first time. The food was all very good but not a very large selection for the price. The staff was friendly but the service was slow from serving drinks to clearing plates off the table. All in all the food on the brunch buffet was very good but for the price and lack of selection there are other places in town with a better value."}
{"text":"The restaurant was a pleasant surprise. We went for Friday fish fry and I ordered the perch, my husband the cod.
The lake perch was something out of this world! Extremely crunchy and delicious, not dropping in oil and full of flavor. 
I love the concept of the salad bar as you can put together your own salad included with your meal if you want. Their clam chowder is amazingly good, very fresh and not sure thick. By far this is my top restaurant for fish fry in the madison/sun prairie area."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Have been there for steaks as well as for 1/2 price burger night on Monday's.  Food is great, love the salad bar, and everyone is very friendly and helpful. Really enjoy Jesse, top notch!   Oh and deserts are incredible.  Sun Prairie has been in need of a place like this for a long time!"}
{"text":"My family went here last Friday and was very pleased to find a supper club feel. Great perch as was my wife's ribeye. Bar tenders were great as was the wait staff. Food was flavorful and presented well. Salad bar was just what we were looking for. Just the basics and no fluff. We will be back many times

Went with the family and inlaws for my birthday last night. Another great meal."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to hear that a new restaurant opened up in Sun Prairie, so the opening of Watertower Chop House made me happy!

My husband and I tried out Watertower on a Wednesday night. They have a \"date night\" special on Wednesdays with a deal on appetizers, so we were excited to try it. We were served crunchy bread and cheese spread when we sat down, real supper club-style!

We each ordered an entree (prime rib for my  husband and salmon for me), so we both got salad bar included with our meals. We were both pretty impressed with the salad bar. Our meals were also very good.

We're planning to come back to Watertower Chop House for sure!"}
{"text":"We left here last night without eating!l We have been several times and will never again! Not 1 person here is ever friendly or kind. And who runs out of 2 types of fish at 6:30 on Friday???  Never again- and BTW their prices are high for just ok food-go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a Friday night fish fry and our experience was less than ideal. We were seated in a timely fashion and placed our orders right away and made our way over to the salad bar. The selection was poor and the lettuce looked like it had been sitting out for hours. When our fish finally came, it was nothing special. I personally preferred Culver's over it and that is much cheaper. Our waitress was pleasant but not very attentive- we sat with our drinks empty for most of the meal. The smell in the place was also horrible, I get that it might be part of the 'look' but it was very musty and didn't appeal to me at all. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"New York Strip was only $24.00 and was awesome plus nice selection of sides.  Lovely salad bar is worth the extra $5, especially since it includes a soup. Pass on the fried shrimp next time.
Be sure to have a Grasshopper.... Super yummy!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here  on a Saturday evening. I ordered the filet and it was very good. The relish dish starter was nice and salad bar is great. I would not order the desserts though as they are not made in house and they were poor tasting. All tables were full but we got pretty good service for such a busy time. I would  recommend this establishment ."}
