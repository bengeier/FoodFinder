{"text":"Nothing fancy here. Just good fried oysters and some neat history. We met the owner and she waited on us herself. She was extremely accommodating for 6 hungry patrons who needed a late night bite."}
{"text":"Great lunch in Market Square, and it is a PGH institution. The food is awesome, low prices, and a sick poster of Rocky Marciano. Definitely worth the time if you are working in downtown."}
{"text":"We walked in and sat down at the counter. We were never greeted and proceeded to sit for close to 10 minutes with no acknowledgement. We got up and left. As we were walking out one of the waitresses yelled \"Thanks for coming\" to which my reply was \" Thanks for not serving us\". I will never go back. Save yourself the time and effort and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Gist - 2.5-3 stars..basic institution of market square and known for their fish sandwich which is more size i think than real special taste..simple fried seafood on paper plates/beer type place

Food:
* Fish Sandwich Basket - got the fish sandwich which is fried not battered which was huge as usual (note does not have any tomato, lettuce or extra stuff) also add on some thick french fries & coleslaw which was ok. 

* Oyster Shooter - so this is the only raw oyster thing they have..and it is ideal for me cuz it is cheap ($1.5 i think?) and comes w/ a baby side of beer hehe...to wash it all down..I wish other restaurants had this!

Overall - If you have never been, come at least once to check-out the decor and have a couple oyster shooters & fish sandwich to compare to the other known place Whooly's (i think?)...Taste wise nothing \"out of this world\" but good portions"}
{"text":"One of the best seafood places to go in town. I ordered fish n chips, it was perfect, nice big chunks of beer battered cod cooked to perfection,  for a Friday I was in n out the door!. Always friendly service  too."}
{"text":"My fiancé have lived in Pittsburgh for about a year and a half and this was by far the worst food and service we've had living here. 

We had high hopes for the fresh oysters. When they arrived they were served in little plastic Dixie cup shooters and were flavorless and gelatinous.

My fiancé did like her fish sandwhich but when she told the server she gave her regular Pepsi instead of diet our server rolled her eyes and stormed off.

I do not recommend this restaurant. Please support good food and service in Pittsburgh elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a bad quality restaurant.  I ordered key west oyster plate with $12 cash.  But I just received 4 small pieces of oyster bread with two extremely small bad taste side dishes- did not see the oyster and did not have any oyster taste.  Do not go to this restaurant.  Otherwise, you will waste your Money."}
{"text":"Some of the best seafood that I have had in a while. Their batter and fryer are awesome and I would recommend it to anyone. 

Good and friendly service"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the fried fish sandwiches! They are not greasy or overly breaded so you get a really nice piece of fish on a soft bun. The provolone sticks are another one of my favorites on the menu. Fried fish sandwiches are my all time favorite thing to eat so I've tried a lot, but nothing comes close to this place."}
{"text":"Walked in here xmas eve after primanti bros stopped serving out of the blue, despite us sitting at a table. Place is a total dive but that's part of it's charm. Fried fish between bread. Load up the hot sauce and tartar sauce, get some fried oysters and onion rings, and expect exactly what you ordered. This isn't le bernadin in nyc. Some of these reviews seem like they were expecting fine dining. CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"This place helped me survive my college days in the 1960's as a commuter at Duquesne University. I would walk down Forbes Ave. after class for a fish sandwich, a couple of 'oysters' and a glass of buttermilk (upgraded to a beer after I became legal). The whole thing cost me about 50 cents in those days. 
I stopped back yesterday to remember old times. The place looks largely the same, but the crowds at the bar are gone. The oyster cakes still taste  good, though; a lump of seasoned cracker meal rolled around an oyster and deep fried to a light brown. While the oyster cakes largely serve as a vehicle for hot sauce, they still taste like they used to 50 years ago. The prices are much higher, but the place still holds fond memories of Pittsburgh's working-class past, when the railroad workers would pack the bar after their shifts.
The Oyster House can still serve up a good lunch or afternoon snack, along with a lot of memories over a cold one."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite before the maroon 5 concert. Very little parking. This place consists of 5 tables and a bar because of this the place is always packed. We were lucky to have found 2 seats at the bar. The bartender was frazzled and running around it took him awhile to take our drink order. I ordered classic fish in chips . The fries were very good the fish was kinda greasy but the potion was perfect. This place is a pittsburgh legend u gotta stop in."}
{"text":"A native all my life and  never been, finally went last summer. I felt it was the thing to do. I did not like squeezing in that miniscule bar and eating on a table the size of a frisbee. Look, I love food, and rarely complain, but I feel I have to be honest. Like one guy said, they don't really need our kudos now, as they are there and will remain there. Just like Primanti's and Isaly's,,,,oh wait, haha. The food was passable but could be better. the Oysters were good, and if ever I do go back I will get just them because the crab cakes sucked. Sure, I am spoiled by the east coast cakes I have had in Jersey and Baltimore. And that is the only thumbs up Ballymore will ever get from me!OOH, trendy hotspot you should take visitors to, fill them with cold Irons and fried sea fare, then take them home and they can say they have been there."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time stopping at this establishment the waitress serving the tables is rude and you will die of dehydration waiting for a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"Historic Place for sure, lots of old world charm. The oysters are also old, as in not fresh. The first clue is that they come pre-shucked and served in a plastic cup already in cocktail sauce to cover for the fact they have little to no taste. Cool spot for a beer and then move on to someplace to eat."}
{"text":"This was our first time to the Original Oyster House.  It is cash only so they conveniently have an ATM right outside for those who do not have cash on them.  We walked to the Oyster House from our hotel so I'm not sure where you would park since street parking is very, very limited.  It is on the Market Square.  We went on a Saturday evening in January.  At the time that we went, only the small bar area was open.  There is a large eating area with chairs and tables adjacent to the bar but it was not open.  The bar area is not very big but there was a good amount of people flowing in and out to eat and for take out.  The food was very reasonable.  The next time we are there I would like to try their oysters.  I saw someone else's order and it looked really good.  They have a full bar available.  I had a side order of calamari and my hubby had the shrimp basket.  He liked the spicy sauce that it came with the basket.  The shrimp was almost popper sized but he enjoyed it.  The calamari was the ring type, more on the thin side.  It was good, not rubbery.  At each table they have tartar sauce, ketchup, vinegar and hot sauce.  The place is very casual, relaxed and reasonable."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment aside from the great oysters and reasonable service.  The rest of the food wasn't fresh and the portions were small.  Got a sense that it was better in the past, how else would it be around so many years."}
{"text":"Eh. Food served on paper plates. Long wait time for initial service and drink refills. Just not what I had in mind. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of those places - it's been there forever, it doesn't need your approval or your patronage, it will outlive us all, the end. 

We were on our way to the Pirates game and our locals told us it was the thing to do so, even though we were still full from a late lunch, we went there, got some beers, way too many fried oysters, and got the hell out of the way when the check was settled. 

If you actually are going expecting to enjoy the food - be aware that an order of three lightly seasoned breaded oysters is the equivalent of three White Castle burger-sized oysters (cause they've been pounded flat) smothered in about half a cannister of 4C breadcrumbs and then fried. I think \"stick to your ribs\" is an adequate way to describe the sensation I was wrestling with on my way across the Roberto Clemente Bridge. 

It's also one of those places where if you're trying to eat healthy and you order the salad, you get a styrofoam plate with iceberg and a couple anemic slices of tomato on top. 

Also, I recall there being some sort of a deal where, if you join the birthday club, you get a Rocky Marciano poster on your big day.

So yeah, I'll totally be back!"}
{"text":"I came here because this is a Pittsburgh landmark. Locals said that I had to come here. I HAD to come here. As for the food: fried oysters, who does such a thing? I ate them, but it is not something I will ever yearn for in my dreams. Not bad though. I don't think those oysters were from the Ohio river. That is good. This place gets 4 stars because of the atmosphere. It is an ethnographic experience. This isn't a place that tries to recreate a retro Americana ambiance, this is the real deal. The locals were right."}
{"text":"This place is defiantly a historic site! From the floor to the table tops to the bathrooms! I love learning about the history of how places came about. Mary the bartender gave me lots of info.......oldest bar, 1st one to let women in, same flooring, etc. 

The food is frozen so if you're looking for fresh seafood this ain't it! I had one of their famous oysters.  Very good I highly recommend getting only 3 very filling. I had the special crab cakes & 2 sides. Imitation crab & lots of filling. So I don't need to tell you how nasty that was. My house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor. 

I did notice-after I ordered-everyone was getting the fish sandwich. So I was like dang! I should've ordered that. My return is questionable. If I go back its only going be for the fish sandwich & oysters!"}
{"text":"Went to the Steelers vs Ravens playoff game with a friend from NJ.  While waiting for the game to start we wanted some oysters.  We looked up oyster bar on our phones and low & behold, there was the original Oyster House only 0.5 miles away from our hotel.  We were so happy that we walked right over. First thing they said to us was, we only accept cash.  Ok, not a problem, old fashioned perhaps but we wanted fresh oysters on the half shell.  Guess what, no fresh oysters.  We proceeded to order some fried oysters, fish, onion rings and a few beers.  The oysters were still frozen in the middle, the fish was undercooked and the onion rings were terrible.  The beer was cold and that is the only reason they got one star.  I was embarrassed because he was my guest and it was my idea.  I don't recommend if you want good food.  If a cold beer is all you want, go for it.  Otherwise, stay away!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here at the OOH on a cold day in early Spring. It was a Wednesday, and thankfully not a Friday in Lent where it would have been much busier.

I opted for the dual crabcakes platter with two sides, and the crabcake was mushy, not fried long enough, and just lacking any reasonable portion of crab meat.

I've had the fried oysters before, and they were pretty good.  I think your results might be highly dependent on what you order.

This lunch kinda sucked."}
{"text":"The waiter was very pleasant; however, he didn't bring my son his beer, forgot his girlfriends tea and messed up my entire meal order. He told me what he messed up would just be given to me, it was charged.
I paid extra for lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles as well. A sandwich is bread and fish, period. My sons crab cakes were 90% bread. My tomatoes in my salad were old and mushy. My sons girlfriend got an order of 3 oysters. 7.99 in plastic cups like you put ketchup in at McDonald's, no half shell.  All things consisted I would not recommend and never return."}
{"text":"I came in to grab some lunch before I went off to work. It was nice and sunny outside. Pittsburgh nice, at least (30s and sunny). Still....

I looked over the menu and its short and to the point. A handful of fried seafood things, a small collection of non-seafood sandwiches, and some more various fried things. I settled on their special, which is two crabcakes plus two sides. I got the fries and the onion rings. I also orderd an \"original oyster\" which is actually a gigantic hushpuppy with a very tiny oyster inside of it. I was pretty bummed out by that because the two crab cakes were really just basically hushpuppies with a few pieces of crab meat and an occasional piece of krabmeat. Definitely a bummer. The fries and the onion rings were cold. Also a bummer.

Everything tasted okay, I guess. Lots of salt in the crab cakes and oyster. The onion rings, if they were fresh and hot, would have been great. They're freshly made, crunchy and you can actually bite through a piece of the onion and not yank the whole onion out.

The service though...well..it sucked. The bartender ignored me the entire time I was there. I had drank through almost all of my soda before my plate arrived. And yes you yinzers, I said soda, don't act like you've never heard that one before. After I was done eating, I asked for a refill of my soda. He then disappeared for about 10 minutes, which is just long enough to finish a cigarette and cell phone conversation. Hey, I used to be a waiter, too. I know what you're doing. So after he comes back, he hands me my bill. Then he remembers I asked for a soda 15 minutes ago and finally refills my cup. This is approximately 25 minutes after my plate arrives and my cup was dry the entire time.

Other than that, the place is a dive. I like dives though, so this is no thing. They have a good handful of beers, if that's your pleasure. They only had one type of wine, much to the dismay of those seated right behind me. The food's alright, would have been better if it was hot. And I'm sure if I had just kept it simple and gotten a fish sandwich or fish on a dish, it might have been a decent meal. I probably won't be going back. Its in an inconveniant location, the food is barely even par, and the service is horrible.

Also..they do not accept cards. Though they do have an ATM (Mack Machine, whatever the yinzfolk call it), outside."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and it was busy-- about 15-20min wait from the time I walked in till I got my order, but let me tell you, it was worth the wait. I had the oyster sandwich, clam chowder, and calamari. The oysters were very tender and I only wished the sandwich had a few more on it, cuz it wasn't very filling. Good thing I had the soup & calamari.. The clam chowder was sinfully delicious, with a heavy cream base and tons of flavor. The calamari was okay, nothing to brag about, but the sandwich and chowder couldn't have been better. 
The oyster House is split up into two different restaurants next-door to each other.. To the right side is a sitdown restaurant with a bar and the left side is a casual quick stop shop with a counter to order at (which is where I chose to go). The interior is a bit dark & outdated and it doesn't have much of a welcoming atmosphere, but the outdoor tables in Market Square are a great option, weather permitting."}
{"text":"Had 5 people come in for my birthday and a huge disappoint is an understatement, charged for sodas we didn't order, didn't get half the stuff we ordered. Then a huge fail to their \"email\" club, told they don't take emails or print out of emails. Told they only take coupons mailed, not the email club you sign up for on their website. Not even a simple happy birthday for having your birthday dinner there, definitely don't recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Only has 1 person working and serving the restaurant. Took 15 minutes to be asked if I wanted a drink, another 15 minutes to get a menu after asking for one. Annoying wait, they need to hire more people"}
{"text":"Wow, what happened? When I worked in town I would go every Thursday for a fish sandwich. Loved the place! Although the food was good but not sure what happened to the old staff. I was there for lunch & there were at least five female servers who were serving about four tables. They were bickering loudly over everything, couldn't get their orders straight. This was making me uncomfortable so when my food arrived, I gulped it down & got the hell out of there before a fight broke out among the staff. So much for tradition! Now it looks like auditions for a roller blade competition. Won't be going back. Such a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and was surprised by how small the restaurant was. One wall is the bar and then there are about 6 tables for guests to sit down and eat. The menu has a few different sea food options, many of them fried. I got the jumbo fish sandwich and my friend got the fried butterfly shrimp with a side of oysters. My sandwich was good, tasted like a typical fish fry; the shrimp was also pretty good. Nothing incredibly special but filling and satisfying."}
{"text":"Not what I expected.  When you call yourself the an oyster house, I expect oysters galore on the half shell and not just shooters and fried.  It was good though.  It is a bar and take out or quick eat in joint.  The coleslaw was very good and we did enjoy our meal with the crusty attitude."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh landmark . The service was very good . Local Pittsburghers are the staff so you get the Yinzer attitude , which I love . No BS. The food was good . Try the clam strips , crab balls , and oystetr shooters. The old pictures of celebrities on the wall and old school feel make this worth it."}
{"text":"Myself and a work colleague were finishing up lunch and paying and waitress took our bill with tip included, and made a motion to a woman waiting for a table.  She said to the lady, 3 min. Table will be ready. We were gathering our stuff and mid conversation and clearly leaving, and waitress said \"hey guys come on,  people are waiting for this table\". Extremely rude. Probably will turn around and leave if I see her again working. She looked like a regular too. Perhaps our 1:00 to 1:45 lunch was too long?!?!?    I thought that was extremely rude. Too bad because great food!"}
{"text":"This place might be great, but I'll never know, and they'll never get my business or that of my family.  I just called to inquire whether they take reservations.  The response was \"Nope, it's a first come first serve basis\", and a HANG UP.  I called back to give feedback; the same person answered \"hello\" and HUNG UP AGAIN when he heard my voice.  If this is a traditional Pittsburgh eatery, I'm ashamed to be a Pittsburgher.  What I love about this city is its humanity.  I have no problem with the policy...just never hang up on a customer.  It's a shame for the restaurant; we have a large family that we had planned to host.  Shame on them for losing a big tab!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and after looking at there menu, which was hard to choose from, but I went with the fish and chips (about $7.50) and a side of coleslaw. This place is cash only so make sure you bring it. Loved that the crispiness of the fish and the fries were amazing. What I really loved about this place is that on the table they have oil, vinegar, tartar sauce, hot sauce and the fish came with cocktail sauce so you get to try a huge spectrum of taste with your fish. 

This is my kind of place, its reasonably priced, quick, a variety of condiments, great food, they have booze, if I am ever back in the Burgh I am stopping here."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Thursday and feel they could have done better.  The Calamari was delicious- light, fluffy and super tender.  The fries were pretty good but not great.  The fish (on the Fish & Chips) was a disappointment.  The fish was chunky & flakey but the batter wasn't fully cooked.  The outside was crispy but the layer between the crispy outer layer and the fish was still pasty & batter(y).  It needed cooked for another minute or two and it would have been delicious.  If I go again- I'll ask for my fish to be well done (can I actually do that?).  

Here's a tip for you all- Join their Birthday club, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Traveled to this establishment through busy downtown event traffic seeking oysters. Sat at the bar. I ordered a Corona with lime and it was given to me promptly and it tasted fresh and cold. Soon after that I was informed they were completely out of oysters. An oyster bar having supply issues like this is completely inexcusable, especially one that operates in a high profile location like Market Square. Also, the bartender seemed very unhappy, and was having difficulty fulfilling his duties. He was having verbal conflicts with the waitress who was attempting to order drinks from him. When another guest had an issue with a dish that had been served to them, the staff yelled up the stairs to what I assumed to be the kitchen for someone to come down and resolve the matter. Very unprofessional atmosphere. The tension among the staff was palpable, it just didn't seem like any of them really wanted to be there, which made me not want to be there. The supply issues and the way the employees were operating leads me to believe this place is poorly managed. I paid for my drink and left, not wanting to risk putting in a food order to the overwhelmed staff for a dish I didn't come for anyway."}
{"text":"Historic feel, friendly staff and good eats! Service was fast and staff accommodating. They were quick in refills and making sure you were never forgotten. Ask the staff for recommendations if you are visiting from out of town!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and on a nice day, there is nothing better than eating it outdoors. The combos are great. On my last visit I had the oversized fish sandwich. It was good, but the bun was dry and stale. I wish I'd ordered the oyster sandwich, but next time. They have great slaw and fries and the staff were very friendly and accomodating. Love it!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is charming and the service very friendly... but the cash only gimmick isn't advertised and food is ok at best, the prices are super cheap and probably a great place to grab a quick sandwich, but more like an upscale long john silvers, i would say try it out at least once, but just not for me"}
{"text":"This restaurant is horrible.  The waitress was rude and tried to rush us.  The only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind.  How can you call yourself an Oyster House and not serve either fried oysters or raw???  The food overall was ok.  I would never go or eat there again!"}
{"text":"Walked in, the place was empty and then the smell hit us, sewage or super bad drains, too bad for such a historic place. Possibly was an off day?"}
{"text":"Everything about this place seems very antiquated.  I wasn't impressed with my clam chowder.  There was some kind of bread component inside the clam chowder that may have been an attempt at dumplings but just tasted like soggy bread.  

I'm not a fan"}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place to anyone wanting good fish/seafood. Thirty years ago yes. Things have drastically changed. My husband ordered baked scrod. It looked like a child's portion. It had to be less than 2oz. I had the crab cakes but couldn't find the crab. The French fries were soggy and greasy. The cole slaw lacked flavor. 
I had a coupon, which had expired. The condition on the coupon stated it was still good for the amount ($7.50) we payed for it but the owner refused to honor it and told me to take it up with the seller, HALF-OFF PITTSBURGH."}
{"text":"Pre-fab fried food. Decor has character. The beer is cheap."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible. You walk in and it has the coolest aesthetic, with old pictures of beauty queens and boxers adorning the walls. The food is absolutely astounding as well! There's a lot of options but the classic fish and chips is to die for! And the people who work there so so friendly. Not once have I ever had bad service. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Worth the visit, if only for a slice of Pittsburgh History.  The buttermilk and oyster is a tradition.  I got the fish boat, and I enjoyed it very much.  The food is mostly made from scratch and the french fries are delicious.

It's not fine dining, but it's honest food at a reasonable price.  The restaurant dates from 1870, so it makes it the oldest business in the city."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of 4 and the food was average. Cash only & we didn't know until we went to pay. No signs letting you know. The male bartender was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Had an awful crab cake here with little crab in it but mostly lots of breading and filler.. Even the Phillips brand ones at Costco are better than most. And of course Eleven has the best ever. But anyways, hubby got a deep fried cod filet that was sandwiched between 2 hamburger buns, which was pretty decent fried fish while it was hot and crispy... But my crab cake was sadly unforgivable."}
{"text":"Ok, my gut told me not to order the raw oysters from here and I should definitely had listened. Shared 6 raw oysters shooters with my friend, who ended up pretty sick from them. I love oysters normally, but these were slimy, flavorless and all around disgusting. It felt like they'd been sitting in a vat of their own slime for a while. I'm guessing they order these oysters for deep frying, and really shouldn't have raw oysters on the menu at all. On top of it all, they weren't even cheap ($13 for 6), came in plastic cups with plastic forks on no ice.

We also shared a bowl of chowder which was pretty good. The soup earned them a second star. I suspect that the fried seafood, which was most of the menu, would have been pretty good too. Unfortunately I don't think I'll be returning to try them, too grossed out by my first experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place for what it is . . . An old time, steel city, Market Square, fried seafood & beer spot that has not changed a bit since the days your great grandfather frequented as a young steel worker!  Not a date place!
   Stopped in before an afternoon Pirate game with the guys for lunch and then walked back to PNC. 
 The food and beer were served quickly and quite tasty.  Must try a fried oyster. I've never had one quite like this!
 All in all a fun taste of Pittsburgh!!
 Will go back!"}
{"text":"What happened.  I've eaten here for years and the last few months the chowder is now inedible it tastes like it's from a can."}
{"text":"Hmmmm, apparently I didn't get quite enough grease in my diet while in PA (you know, with all those extraneous French fries on salads and sandwiches and such).  
This place is pretty bare bones, CASH ONLY, and it looks like it might not have been thoroughly cleaned since it was built.  We asked for separate checks (we were here for a conference and each has an expense account to submit) and the waitress didn't seem too happy about our request.  I might add that we were the only people in the restaurant at 8pm on a Saturday.  But I digress, you wanted to know about the food, didn't you?
It was ALL greasy.  The crab cakes were possibly the most dense foodstuff I've ever seen.  The Fish 'n chips were like nuggets, the fried sampler was ENORMOUS and one of our guys ordered the Monster fish sandwich, yup, it was monster all right.  only about 1/3 of it fit on the bun.
Overall it was just bland sea food.  no one was upset at the choice, but no one was raving about it either."}
{"text":"Great fast fried seafood, cash only and a few other options.

Don't be confused this place consists of two establishments and one kitchen. One is a bar with waiters and liquor, the other is a fast food style place. I chose the latter. Walk in and you will find a menu board with a few specials printed out hanging off of it, no frills, no credit cards, all local flavor.

I went with the Titanic special $10.75 Which included a \"monster\" fish sandwich, and two sides, I chose fries and onion rings.

Everything is made to order, which means crispy fries, rings and a crust on hot flakey fish. The fish here is the real thing not some unnatural square, a large fillet of mild white fish with a great breading on a simple bun. The condiments are on the table and up to you, tartar sauce, hot sauce, a spicy \"famous\" vinegar and ketchup. It was a big sandwich but not titanic maybe just queen marry.

Bottom line if you want some fried food and have cash give this a try."}
{"text":"This was the worse meal my family has had ever. We all had cod sandwiches they were mushy. We ordered cheese sticks they were huge I was excited then I took a bite. No taste at all I had to kill it with salt. How can you be a fish place and have worse fish than eatnpark? This will be the last time we eat here. One positive about this place is the staff was nice."}
{"text":"If you're gonna be an Oyster House, you better have the best around. Not so here. They're deep fried (meaning it's mostly breading) and taste like something that's been deep fried - not like oysters. 
Green beans from a can, cole slaw was generic, onion rings were unimpressive, even their Pittsburgh Taters (which are not tater tots, but are chips) tasted like they were made that morning and not to order. The crab cakes are great, if you get anything, get those. Given the history I expected A LOT more out of their food, service, and ambiance."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy this place.  It reminds me of Primanti's.  It may have been good / great at one point when good was a deep fried, but not anymore.

The fish sandwich is bland on a generic bun.  The soup was nothing to write home about.  The fries were generic."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs ! The staff is rude and Ms Piggy ( as another customer referred to her as ) refused to serve our kids dessert while we had a drink at the bar. If you go you will leave disappointed ! I'm surprised they lasted a month let alone 100 years."}
{"text":"We stopped here expecting them to have raw bar options as their name would imply.  However, they have several cooked selections. That said, we only stopped into this location for a drink and then moved on.

The restaurant includes outdoor seating and a long straight bar that extends from the front of the restaurant to the rear.  Overall, the interior isn't spectacular, but has several nostalgic photos of famous people (both local and national), some of the photos autographed.

Their drink selection is simple with many local brews and mass produced American beers."}
{"text":"Let's face it folks--this ain't McCormick & Schmick.  It's a dive, it's cheap, and the fish here is oh so good, providing you lower your expectations a little.  Meaning that you're not gonna get five-star cuisine but you'll get good basic chow here.  I went for the baked scrod sandwich and a side of hot sausage soup.  Trust me, if you're a soup lover like me, you'll want to come here whenever that's the soup of the day.

Guess I'll be hitting the gym tonight after work."}
{"text":"Hubby insisted on checking this place out and it turned out to be a disappointment. I didn't like the fish sandwich nor the oysters.
3 stars for all the history behind this little space."}
{"text":"This is one of the better places to get a simple fried fish sandwich.

The atmosphere is a little wet, dank and dreary. The place feels as old as it looks. Still, the pictures of various celebrities and sports stars gives it an authentic, old-time feel.

The staff isn't overly friendly but they're not rude either; as another reviewer said, it's a little Pittsburghese attitude. It's just matter-of-fact. Come in, order your fish and eat it.

During the summers, they also have soft-serve ice cream which is a nice treat after lunch.

I keep coming back here because the fried fish sandwich really is worth it. A huge filet of fish, fried up simply. The fish is moist, perhaps a little greasy, but still delicious and the filet is thick so you're not getting more breading than fish."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great for anyone in the mood for seafood. The clam chowder is as creamy and flavorful as everyone says it is. The fish and shrimp are very fresh, though the crab cake was nothing special. The place is a historic landmark, and the decor suits the laid-back atmosphere. The service is pretty friendly, too. Overall, I didn't find the experience as bad as others have in the past, and the restaurant is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I simply like this place. This is the original decor that others copy. This is fried fish and oysters the way I like them best. Lightly coated and deep fried. The clam chowder is creamy and flavorful with plenty of clams. 

I have never found the servers anything but pleasant. I suspect their behavior has a lot do to with who is at the table. When I come to Pittsburgh, The Original Oyster House is a must. 

It is exactly what should be in a downtown and serves exactly what people have liked for 100 years. Thank you Pittsburgh for keeping food history alive."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Oyster House for lunch today.  First off, they only take cash so be prepared.  I sat near the back and ordered the clam chowder.  It was awful.  Extremely salty and thickened with corn starch or flour.  Who ever said it was sinfully delicious must be crazy.  I then ordered their really big fish sandwich.  The fish was good,  it came only on a white hoagie roll.  No lettuce, tomato, cheese or anything.  Just deep fried, breaded fish on a roll.  It was an interesting experience."}
{"text":"One would assume the Oysters would be decent at the \"Original Oyster House\". I highly recommended they change their name. Oysters were awful!

Great clam chowder though. :)"}
{"text":"OK, here's what you need to know first-- they do not serve raw oysters. Where I'm from, you can't call your restaurant an \"Oyster House\" without raw oysters served, unless you want a good ass whoopin'. 

Nothing else about this place remotely conveys \"Oyster House.\" It's a fried seafood joint, that doesn't serve Yuengling nor takes credit cards. We got all of our food on Styrofoam plates with plastic silverware. The \"waitress\" stood and watched us eat most of the meal. This particular lady had a substantial moustache and sideburns.  It was unsettling. You also have to pay before being served. 

The New England Clam Chowder was good."}
{"text":"We just ate here and it was a wonderful experience!  The waitress was extremely friendly, going out of her way to interact with our four-year old.  This place has a neat old-city vibe and the food is really tasty.  Good prices too!  Our bill was $55 for 5 beers and three entrees.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has been around since 1870, so that's pretty impressive alone. We walked in and sat down at the bar and an older lady that works there came up and asked if we had ever been there. We said no, so she perked up and asked if we wanted to look around and hear about the history. She showed us all of the pictures of past Miss America pageants that the previous owner went to (a lot!) and told us the history of the place. Women weren't even allowed to eat here 'til the 60s! 

The clam chowder was incredibly rich and salty in the best way. As for the oysters, we ordered the \"lightly\" breaded option, which comes with three fried oysters, but ours came with four as a bonus. The batter was seasoned great, and apparently the same recipe since 1916, but if that's what they mean by \"lightly\" battered, I wonder what their heavy battered option is like. Our oysters had a very thick coating of batter so the oyster taste and texture was a little lost in it. We also had a couple clams with some sandy grit in them :/ The clam chowder was so good and the service was some of the best I've ever had, so it brought what would have been a three star rating from me up to a four."}
{"text":"I hate to give this restaurant a 1 star, because I have dined here a handful of times with no issues until this last time. 

If you sign up for their rewards program you get $10 toward your entree and the choice of either a t-shirt or mug. I just had a birthday last weekend so I decided to order a spicy whitefish sandwich to go. This is my go to sandwich when I eat here and I have always liked it. When I returned to my desk for lunch I opened up the wrapper to find what looked like a cooked piece of fish. My first bite into it was like biting into rubber. So I immediately pulled it a part to see if it was cooked. I was extremely grossed out to find raw fish looked back at me. Needless to say I threw it away and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Sat outside one Thursday evening to have dinner. I was surprised out how cheap the food was here and how delicious it was. I had the crab cakes and I really enjoyed them. I was a bit shocked to find everything served in plastic (plastic plates, cups, and silverwear). Also, this is a cash only place. I guess that explains why their prices are so low. We didn't go inside, but from just looking thru the window, it didn't look like much. At the end of the day, good food and good service. I would go back."}
{"text":"As many times as I walked passed during my lunch or random stroll through Market Square, I've never stopped here. I decided to get lunch here after figuring out I've eaten everywhere for lunch downtown at least 3 times. 

I ordered the crab cake meal; 2 cakes & 2 sides. I chose french fries and green beans (i dont know why the beans, just wanted to say I had green beans for lunch) I was satisfied. Everything was okay and it filled me up. I saved one of my crab cakes because of how full I was, then gave it away to a nice lady on the street. She seemed satisfied :) 

**however, i prefer my crab cakes more like a patty instead of mushy & more crabmeat than breadcrumbs...... :( 

I have to bring Bobby here to see what he thinks.."}
{"text":"Dirty and smelled bad. The woman behind the bar was just mean to the server who seemed to be trying. When we ordered a drink the bar lady informed us it would be 10.00 per drink. Not sure why this was needed. Looked around and decided not to order food. Both of us work in healthcare, one doctor and one nurse, and feel sure things were not up to code. The couple next to us ordered drinks and declined to order food as well after the woman went to the bathroom. Nice server but terrible customer service from bar lady who also had no clue of contents of a Long Island Iced Tea. Reading a few reviews here where people got sick after eating there. Be careful!"}
{"text":"What a cool place! Rich in history and they've tried to preserve it. Feels like you are stepping back in time. Walls are covered with pictures of famous people who've eaten there. The food was served on paper plates and with platicware which isn't so great, but it fits. The food was fabulous! Some of the best fish and chips I've ever had. Especially for inland fish. Great experience!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place. It is CASH ONLY!! which kinda stinks. The food prices are very reasonable, imo the best thing here are the crab cakes. Everything else is fried."}
{"text":"I have only ever been to Market Square once before, so I was excited to find myself here again! Darren suggested the Original Oyster House for our afternoon meal. Mmmm seafood! I could go for some good seafood, especially fresh oysters! Now, I am from an area not far from the ocean, and every year we had a community oyster roast, you know: fried, steamed, and raw oysters. 

Ummm, yeah. Big let down. I should know better than to have high expectations. If I wanted Long John Silvers, or better still Captain D's (look it up if you never heard of Captain D's), then I'd hit up one up, AND get a friendlier server to boot. I also bet I could get into a ladies room without needing a key elsewhere, or even some SWEET N LOW for my tea! Sorry...the more I write the angrier I am getting. One thing I am starting to notice about this area, it seems acceptable to have curt or even rude service. I suppose I was jaded before.

Ok, the food itself. The side of coleslaw was rather good. It tasted fresh and creamy! The crabcake...(can I call it that?) was more like a clump of Stove Top Stuffing and a tiny bit of crab meat. The two jumbo fried shrimp were ok. At least they weren't too greasy. And the frigg'n \"original oyster\"... WHERE IS THE OYSTER??? Nothing but breading. I think I saw something resembling an oyster in there somewhere. And every entree had to be fried. Ugh."}
{"text":"Are you in the mood for a fish sandwich?  Or something else that's been fried?  If so, look no further than the OOH in Market Square.  Yep, you'll be saying OOH yourself when you see the size of the fish slab you get on your sandwich.

It's probably not too healthy, and their sides are a little hit-or-miss (I enjoy the mac and cheese and onion rings), but the OOH knows how to put a piece of fried fish in between two slices of bread.  There's tubes full of tartar sauce for an even unhealthier topping, and the option of chicken finger or crab cakes for non-fish lovers, but let's face it - getting any of those is a mistake.

Go with the fish sandwich or - if you must - an oyster sandwich.  Anything else isn't worth the trip there."}
{"text":"Finally an authentic visit in Pittsburgh!  This place is a piece of Pittsburgh history and when the woman behind the counter realized we were first timers, gave us a quick tour. The connecting bar is a little piece of history and is the oldest bar in town and kind of gritty which is part of the charm and its story relating to prohibition is impressive.
We ordered the special of the day which was a good size fish sandwich with 2 sides for under $8.  More than enough food is given.  I got the slaw and onion rings and both were excellent and the fish sandwich was perfect.  So glad I found this place, was getting discouraged but this was a delight."}
{"text":"This place is dreadful! 

Our food was pretty much inedible. We paid our bill--they only take cash--and went to Primanti Bros. for a real meal. We've never in our lives done that before EVER!!!"}
{"text":"It's been going downhill,  Mary, a 30 plus years fixture, is no longer there.  The fish is no longer big just a 6 oz portion. The clam chowder is just plain lousy, tasteless and thick.  I use to frequent often, not any longer.  I think today was my last visit.  Strange that Mary is not sick, not retired, just not working there anymore.  Something had to happen.  Probably just like corporate America, 30 year loyal employees are no longer valued!

12/5/2016. 

Returned to give them one last chance. Got the tuna sandwich.  I really loved their tuna for years now.  It was not the same, actually tasteless!! The price went up from 3.90 to 5.90.  The sandwich is half the size served in a small hamburger bun.  Maybe 3 oz portion.  The bun was the cheap ones out by in a grocery store.  The onion rings were not deep fried long enough, they were hard.  Well this place really is going down hill fast.  Not like it was when Mary was running the show.  This was my official last visit.  My prediction is that the regulars will be abandoning this place and it will only be the tourist who will be unknowingly experiencing a crappy meal.  Mary if you reading this, you are missed!!!"}
{"text":"My mind is slightly blown right now...come to the \"original oyster house\" and you can't get raw oysters on the half shell. Also cash only. That's all I have to say."}
{"text":"Outside of maybe Primanti Bros. You really don't get much more Pittsburgh than the Oiriginal Oyster House. The prices are cheap, the food is very good as it the service."}
{"text":"Been coming my here once or so a year for the last few years. I don't particularly care for the food but when my father in law is in town this is where we go for a beer and a fish sandwich.

He had the cod father and absolutely loved it. I had the chicken strips and they were pretty pathetic. I should have taken a picture. My wife had the popcorn shrimp basket and didn't care for the shrimp, but I thought they were fine. 

Our server was nice. She stopped by often and we never felt like we had to wait for anything. Sitting outside on a beautiful day in market square does make it enjoyable. If only the food were better. Nice history in the place, but that's really about it."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is horrible, but the food was decent.  Although the restaurant was sparkling clean, it didn't smell great (I suspect it was some sulphur-based cleaner vs a sewage problem).  This place has been here forever and it shows - the decor is extremely dated - from the unflattering flat florescent lighting to the old-school message letter sign board menu above the counter.  Not a great look for a Market Square eatery in what has become such a trendy area where competitors offer tastier, fancier fare around the same price.

The food was okay - I got some fresh, hot, underseasoned scrod (fixable) and some *really* good, fresh coleslaw.  The fish was hiding under a giant piece of lettuce with a tomato slice on top (not sure what was going on there).  Everything was plated like a charity worker plates food for the homeless, but again it was hot, fresh and the seasoning thing was fixable with all the available condiments they have in-house.

Big issue is their \"cash only\" policy, which they neglected to put on the door for all to see (I checked).  So, after waiting in line once, I get a nasty surprise at the register with my credit card in hand.  Had to go outside to the (conveniently placed) ATM just outside that charges $2 to withdraw and get back in line a second time.  Not a happy experience during a time-sensitive lunch with friends.

Judging strictly by the food, this place was okay, good even.  It is just in serious need of some Gordon Ramsay-style upgrades to bring this place into the 21st century either by making it a bona fide vintage eatery or Millenial-grade chic seafood to match the rest of the eateries here.  Right now, it's got that \"old and tired feel\" down pat."}
{"text":"I would never eat here again. This place is disgusting! How has this place survived for over a hundred years as they claim? The name of this restaurant is pretty common, so it might be easy to confuse the place with a chain. It's not, just so you know. Essentially it is a bar, with a few tables put towards the wall, and a dozen red-neck looking types hanging out drinking. There is kind of a weird smell that is hard to describe. I used the bathroom to wash my hands, but I felt I had to use hand sanitizer by the time I got back to the table. To top things off there was this grease all over the table.
How'd the food taste? Not so great. I had fish and chips and with it being a house specialty and all, you'd think it would be pretty darn good. But it was average at best and the fries ('chips') sucked. Nearly everything on the menu is fried and I only saw the word 'oyster' in three places - once being at the top of the menu.

This place is CASH ONLY. I guess their business practices haven't changed much since this place opened up.

Food Quality/Taste = 2 Stars
Portion Size Given Price = 2 Stars
Relative Price = 4 Stars
Service = 2 Stars
Experience with Staff = 3 Stars

Clean (yes/no) = hell, to the no."}
{"text":"Rhode-Islander approved!!

How have I not been to this place before?  Authentic clam chowder, delicious fried fish, tartar sauce by the bucket... heaven!

I guess I can see where Pittsburghers may not share my sentiment, but believe me, this is the closest to New England-style seafood I have EVER encountered in the 'burgh.  OK, so they only have clam strips and not whole bellies and clam cakes (fritters) are nowhere to be seen, but the chowder and lightly breaded fish (Famous Fish sandwich) make up for it.

I loved the dynamic in this place.  It was CROWDED (Friday during Lent, what should I have expected?), but the kitchen staff was turning out fish sandwiches by the dozen.

This will definitely become a regular lunch spot for me (if, that is, I can find enough people in the 'burgh who actually like seafood)."}
{"text":"Hey oyster house! Do you remember me!?  I was the girl who came in tonight, alone, around 8pm! I had a camera bag and a side braid? No, of course you don't because I wasn't acknowledged as a human being! Apparently if you are a single diner you don't deserve to have your order taken or even seated. 

I walked in here tonight and wasn't greeted, then stood awkwardly in the door way for a few minutes until the bar tender asked if he could help me. I said I'd like a table and he told me to wait for a waitress. Still nothing. No one came over. 
Then I was handed a menu by the bar tender and sat myself at a table. 20 minutes later, nothing. Even when a family was seated immediately next to me, the waitress took their order and didn't even look at me as I stared at her face and got to point where I had to wave the menu around to get her attention. Nothing. 

Eventually I had enough and left, which they still probably didn't notice. 

Make sure to bring a huge group of people if you do make the mistake to eat here, because that's the only way this backwards place will give you any respect. 

If not, and you're alone, don't waste 30 minutes here without being acknowledged like I did."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!
CASH ONLY!
CASH ONLY!

A lot of history with this place.  Be sure to read the back of the menu.

I had the New England Clam Chowder.  To my disappointment it tasted like it was from a can.  I also had the crab cake sandwich which was a bit better with more flavor.  

Honestly, I'll probably skip this place on future visits to PIT."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Thursday night with my fiance for dinner.  We were downtown early for a dance lesson and were looking to kill some time eating dinner.  After entering Market Square we looked at our choices and chose the Oyster House after noting its shaded outdoor seating.  With our decision made, we walked into the Oyster House to get some menus.  The inside of the place consists of a large bar on one side and a line of tables on the other side.  Each table already has on it some hot sauce as well as some vinegar with hot peppers soaking in it.  Soon after we entered we asked the bartender if we could sit outside.  She said yes while giving us some menus and letting us know that the closer we sat to the door, the better service we would have.  With that we headed out the door and sat down in the only shady spot further away from the door.  I did notice that there were two different servers waiting on people outside and figure that was what the bartender was referring to.

After a little bit longer of a wait than I would have liked (and wishing we were sitting closer to the door), we were waited on and I ended up ordering the titanic platter while my fiance went with the crab cakes.  My titanic platter consisted of the monster fish sandwich and 2 sides for which I chose the Pittsburgh cut ribbon taters and then I upgraded my second one to the New England clam chowder.  After only a short time both of the clam chowders came out of the kitchen.  It ended up being surprisingly good with a nice creaminess to it and what I think was fish in addition to the clams.  My fish sandwich was also pretty good as the two filets had a nicely cooked thin coating that was crunchy.  The Pittsburgh cut ribbon taters were also a slight disappointment as they were merely potato chips.  I guess I probably should have asked about them instead of just ordering them.  Finally I was also able to taste my fiances Maryland style crab cakes which I did not  think were good at all.  There was not a hint of old bay in them and it had a distinct mayonnaise taste to it.

The bottom line for me is that I might be back here in the future.  It's never going to be my fish pick of a restaurant in Market Square but I did really enjoy the fried fish and see myself eating here from time to time."}
{"text":"On the last Friday before Good Friday a few of us at work decided to walk down to Market Square to Oyster House for lunch.  Perfect day for a stroll. Now confession, this wasn't my first time here. About 7 years ago a buddy of mine and I were walking through Market Square when a big hailstorm hit and we ducked in here to escape. He hates seafood but I love it!  We waited it out on the bar side with a few beers and I grabbed Clam Strips. Good stuff from what I remember!

Jump to today...I didn't even know there was another side to this place! The Bar side was full so we went one door over and there was still some seating open but a decent line was forming around 11:30a.  It didn't take too long to get through but you could tell the cashiers and cooks were overwhelmed. They did the best they could.  Totally worth the wait to get the CodFather Sandwich Plater that came with Onion Rings, Slaw and a Drink for just over $13 bucks.  

The fish was excellent! The light and fluffy batter was different in a good way. And the slaw was some of the best I've had. Onion Rings were so so.  I'd probably just get fries or something else next time. I will definitely be back now to try other items!

I also love the history and decor here.  It oozes out of this place. From the pictures on the walls to the frame newspaper articles, you know this place is something special. It may not look the best, but I assure you every imperfection most likely has a story."}
{"text":"Well I went here with my friends and my 3 year old daughter for a dinner. I ordered the chicken tender platter with a side of fries and we had some calamari. With regards to food,it's so so,I've been with few different places in Pittsburgh that really serves good enough calamari. I've from the Philippines so i know what is good and what's great in terms of calamari. Our server was ok,she checked on us maybe twice,the only thing I can say is that she didn't tell us they only take cash and they don't take cards. I've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash. I'm a card person. I probably have a buck or two in my wallet coz I use my cards for everything. I have ten credit cards and 2 debit cards in my wallet,good thing I remember my debit card pin,made a withdrawal,paid the atm fee and gave them cash. Imagine a place that's been around since forever and they don't take cards. Are u kidding me? Even mom and pop store accept cards.goodness. I am disappointed. We own a business so I can understand the merchant fees for card transactions but hey,it's part of operating a business. The food was ok but it's not memorable."}
{"text":"This place disappointed me
1. they not friendly 
2. they bringing food in plastic plates
3. I ordered Oyster shots ,they brought one pice
4. Nice interior but expensive
I think it's was my first and last time in this place ("}
{"text":"Not what I expected!  This place is a Pittsburgh institution.  I expected mahogany and brass, but walked into a tiny diner.

Very friendly.  The fish is awesome.  The huge Calimari rings are absurdly tender.  No gumminess at all.  

The place is crazy at lunch time, so I never even attempted it until now.  Worked late and still a decent crowd."}
{"text":"This place is not fancy at all. It's a little hole in the wall that has been around apparently before the turn of the 20th century. The staff are extremely friendly, and service is so quick it seems like your food is in front of you by the time you say \"I'll have a Fish Sandw....\""}
{"text":"TOURIST TRAP. I found this restaurant online and in my hotel room magazine. It had a pretty good number of reviews and apparently the first bar and restaurant in Pittsburgh so I added it to my Pittsburgh dinner options list. It turns out very few people in Pittsburgh or at least in our office actually knew this restaurant. It's an old, tiny restaurant located in the beautiful Market Square. It's so old school they only take cash! The place is called  \"Original Oyster House\" but ironically they don't serve raw oysters, let alone decent oysters! They only have these mediocre breaded oysters that you can have in your sandwich or by themselves. Everything else is average. There is nothing special about this place except for the fact that it was the \"first restaurant\" in Da Burgh as supported by the front door sign \"historical landmark.\" If you're looking for good oysters, raw or not, or simply a good restaurant for lunch or dinner, this is definitely NOT the place."}
{"text":"Being in town for business my co-worker and I decided on another trip to this eatery. It didn't disappoint us last year and this year was the same.
     It's not fancy, we sat at the bar.
     I had the Clam Strips with Onion Rings and a Bowl of Clam Chowder. My friend had the Fried Shrimp, Onion Rings and Chowder. The chowder was as good as last year. Rich, flavorful with tender clams and soft potatoes. My clams and my friends shrimp were both perfect. Downed with a Stella and you can't go wrong.
     We watch them bring out their next to largest fish sandwich and it was huge. well worth the money. I'll be having it next year with the Chowder.
     Don't miss it if you love Clam Chowder."}
{"text":"We just finished the Cajun breaded white fish it was delicious wife had French fries I had fried oysters they where great. but we wanted fried cod and she wanted calamari but they where out of both second time I have been here and where out of signature items that being said both times the item I settled for was delicious. and just in case you have not read the other reviews it's cash only. good place but not in my top favorites. but when it comes to the fish sandwich it comes in second plus reasonable prices.  Not a destination stop but a great second choice."}
{"text":"If this place could be described in four words, they would be:

Angry, Sweaty, Dive-y, and DELICIOUS

This place is a Pittsburgh classic. Don't go here if your looking for some hip and trendy seafood joint. I'm pretty sure the decor hasn't changed in the past 50 years, but that's part of what makes it awesome.

The cashiers and cooks are angry, and slightly scary looking, but not in a bad way (if that makes any sense whatsoever). Their no-nonsense, \"soup-nazi\" style fits with the classic blue-collar Pittsburgh motif this place is still holding on to. If you go in knowing what you want, you'll be fine.

Bottom line, and most importantly, the food. Pretty much everything is fried, but it's all good. Never too greasy, and only lightly breaded. When lent rolls around, you always see every restaurant in town with signs boasting, \"Voted Best Fish in Town.\" I'm not sure who's voting, and how EVERY restaurant seems to have the best. Don't be fooled, Oyster House IS the best fried fish in town."}
{"text":"I love crab cakes. Whenever they are on the menu I have to order it. I got the crab cake sandwich to feed my need for carbs on carbs. The crab cake tasted fine but in the end it was more filler then it was crab. When I eat a crab cake I want it to mostly be the main event filled with large chunks of crab. Sadly this one didn't do that for me."}
{"text":"OOH is a cross between a British Pub and an old-fashioned American counter-top dinner. The decor provides a traditional feel (and so does its clientele).

I decided on the Fish-n-Chips and was almost tempted to order a side too given the inexpensive prices which must be as old as the restaurant; the Fish-n-chips were $7.50. Given the price, I was a bit skeptical of the quality of the food but found myself content once I had a bite. Both the fish and fries were crispy and had a pleasant taste from the batter. My only complaint was that the fish came in three pieces as opposed to one large piece. 

Also, OOH has a house-made pepper vinegar sauce which I decided to try. The basket was sufficient without the vinegar, yet I enjoyed it so much that I decided to generously apply it to."}
{"text":"Good! Cheap! Not fancy!! But damn good and cheap! Soaked in blue collar dive bar nostalgia atmosphere. Food served on styrofoam. But oh what food!!  Sweet, tender fried fish that melts in your mouth... Mmmm.... Coleslaw good, creamy, crunchy, very tasty; onion rings hand battered, crunchy, spicy, not greasy in least. Pepper vinegar nice touch! Decent selection of beers on tap- nothing fancy but a few local microbrews.  Service fast and attentive. Cash only - adds to atmosphere but beware and bring cash!! All and all enjoyable experience- good cheap fresh tasty food in a friendly dive bar atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Seedy and awesome.  This place has been around for years and you can tell it, from the black-and-white pictures hung on the mirrored wall behind the bar to the fading tiles on the floor.

I had a crab cake sandwich and it was perfection.  Large chunks of crab on a potato bun with a swish of mayo, lettuce, and tomato slice.  The house-made chips are great, though I didn't get a whole lot of them with my sandwich - probably less than a serving, though I'm okay because the sandwich was so good, you just needed a little crunch to go with it.

My boyfriend got the jumbo fish sandwich (not to be confused with the massive fish sandwich) and it was indeed jumbo.  Huge piece of fresh cod on a kaisesr roll.  It was the kind where the ends are hanging off the bun.  I can only imagine the size of the massive sandwich!  The fish inside was tender and the batter was perfectly crunchy and golden.

Fresh, delicious fish cooked perfectly.  Our server was super nice and took great care of us.  Definitely put it on your list!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY! Food was good and a fair price. It's not gonna knock your socks off but it's worth the price. We were unprepared for the cash only situation which is. Completely ridiculous for any restaurant in 2017, let alone one in downtown Pittsburgh. Get a Square or a card reader or SOMETHING. I've been to ice cream shops in the middle of nowhere that accepted credit cards. Come on. There are ATMs nearby. Food 3/5. Inconvenience 1/5."}
{"text":"I've lived in Allegheny County my whole life, but only went to the Original Oyster House for the first time today. I'd heard they were reputed to have the best fish sandwich in the city, so that's what I was looking for. 

(By the way, as a side-note to the people, on Yelp and elsewhere, who whine about how a restaurant with the word \"Oyster\" in its name should focus on gourmet oysters and not fish sandwiches: Jesus, grow up. I don't go to Red Robin because I'm in the mood for some robin carpaccio, and I don't go to the Silk Elephant because I'm in the mood for some broiled pachyderms. A name is just a name. This is a very old establishment, and if you didn't do your homework going in to know what's good to order nowadays, then the fault is wholly yours, and I have zero sympathy. To quote a wise Russian: CRY SOME MORE.)

Anyway, back to the sandwich:

I got a platter with fries, slaw, and the sandwich. Sounds very pedestrian, sure, but it was far from ordinary. The slaw was very substantial and was dressed well without being overwhelming. The fries were extremely fresh, had a lot of substance to them, and were satisfyingly crispy. The fish sandwich itself- heck, I can hardly write about it, because I couldn't help but to inhale it. It was the best fish sandwich I can recall ever having eaten, and I could hardly stop myself from wolfing it down, bite after intoxicating bite. It's something you really just need to experience for yourself.

I ate at the bar, and your usual condiments (ketchup, tartar sauce, salt, pepper, etc) were easily at hand. I used a moderate dollop of tartar sauce on my sandwich, which was great, but I'm sure the sandwich would have stood up fine without it, too. A lot of places' fish sandwiches are extremely bland and dry, making the tartar sauce necessary just to swallow it down, but the OOH's sandwich needs no such crutch. The tartar sauce is able to do what it's really meant to do: complement an already-excellent fish dish

So, what else can I say? I feel like my life as a Pittsburgher is enriched just knowing that this place exists, and I can't believe I've been missing out as long as I have been. I'm a graduate student at Pitt, and I can guarantee that whenever I have a solid hour free for lunch, I'll hop a bus downtown to get another fish sandwich platter. After today, I can't imagine a better Pittsburgh lunch- not even Primanti's."}
{"text":"Just checked it out for the first time. Kind of disappointed but it was five dollars for the shrimp basket I got. The shrimp doesn't have any flavor and just tastes like grease. I wanted it to be great because I enjoyed the reviews on here. I did love the atmosphere and the lady that waited on me was a doll."}
{"text":"Horrible, go to Long John Silver's. I hear oyster bar and think delicious raw oysters not deep fried crap ."}
{"text":"Clam chowder was gloopy.  Crab cakes not so good. Waitress (Tracey) was fun and entertaining."}
{"text":"I got the buttermilk and woah - I feel like someone played a trick on me! I could barely drink a quarter inch of that stuff until I felt my lactose intolerance crunching me. The fish fry was good, though I would save the fish fry stomach for Wholey's next time. 

This place is 3 rooms in 1. The southernmost is a bar, which would have been fun to discover before I found the ordering and dining room. The best part about the 3 rooms might be the spiced vinegar sauce. I load that stuff on.  

The staff was incredible in their efficiency and intolerance. Lovely too. I love that Pitt gruff."}
{"text":"Aside from a rather rank men's restroom that assumes you'll only have to relieve your bladder and not your bowels (there's no sit-down commode), I did not find Original Oyster House to be the poorly-serviced dirthole with middling food it is being made out to be.

OOH (how's that for an acronym?) has been one of those establishments I'd been meaning to visit for most of my life but just never got around to frequenting until Saturday's Occupy Pittsburgh march brought us to Market Square, giving Kay and I the perfect excuse to stop in. 

We both went for the Make it Your Way Seafood Platter, which goes choose-1-choose-2-choose-1 on ya, granting the big-eyed diner the chance to sample a shipload of menu items for under $10. 

You know I got the oysters, 2 lightly breaded ones to be exact, and they were as juicy, sea-salty, and deliciously slimy as they are supposed to be. 

A crab cake came next, and my only complaint about it was that it was slightly lacking in the crabmeat. Other than that, I found it to be a lip-smacker. 

I substituted a cup of the clam chowder for one side and a buck extra without looking back. The clam chunks were ample, the potato cubes yielded to the teeth beautifully, and the broth was creamy, buttery, ambrosial.  

The Beer-Battered Fish Nuggets, however, shockingly stole the show, knocking the oysters from the stage to headline. The 3 gigantic cubes of fish (cod?) encased in a bronze jacket of yeasty, ale-imbibed bronze were saved for last so as to savor their innate succulence sans any sauce or condiment. 

Not being able to resist and not having had one in a decade during a takeout meal, I had the Original Oyster. This isn't so much a breaded oyster as it is a fried, fat, starchy, elliptical biscuit that has an oyster in it...somewhere. It's not for everyone, and I'm not sure it's even my thing being that I like to actually taste the oyster, but it is a memorable novelty. Although, to avoid potential disappointment, I recommend sticking with the lightly breaded oysters (look for them on the menu). 

Perhaps my roots are talking, but I instinctively knew I'd feel at home in this scrappy hangout despite what I'd heard and read, finding the swell dumb-waiter and welcoming, aged interiors anything but bleak. No, on this sunny, encouraging Saturday, OOH was alive with friendly chatter and a varied clientele. 

As it is with Primanti's, the help is pressured due to the volume of traffic and are not grouchy. To the contrary, considering how busy OOH gets, I found the entire staff to be pretty jovial, so much so that I gave more than a 20% tip to our harried server, getting a smile and an excited \"Thanks hon!\" from her in return. Hey, she's one of the 99% too, y'know? God love her. 

Then again, the reputedly crabby older ladies always end up taking a shine to me for whatever reason, and that's been the case for as long as I've been alive. 

OOH is...\"real\". Not everyone likes that.  I do. 

Maybe that's why OOH liked me."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to this old fashion place. The atmosphere is great, old, vintage etc, but the food was sub par .
    The New England chowder was quite bland, lacking in any decent flavor.
   To add insult to injury, they do not even have oyster crackers at an oyster house!
   The crab cake was all dense and mostly bread crumbs. 
The prices are decent,but truthfully I would rather spend a little more for most tasty food. I think the place survives on its bar business and history.
   They also do not have a true oyster bar."}
{"text":"My parents and I came here after my dad had boasted about how good there food was and that he would bring his HP customers here for lunch. Upon arrival we immediately were ignored so we ended up seating ourselves. 

The place was unacceptably dirty, our table was dirty the floor was dirty, heck even the walls seemed to have a layer of grime. Both the waitress and the bartender were extremely  rude. 

My mom and I got a beer and my dad tried to order a martini, immediately we received dirty looks from both the bartender and the waitress, they said they didn't have them so my dad asked for straight vodka in a glass to which she brought a shot  of vodka instead. I understand it's not a full bar or a classy place but to serve alcohol and react the way the servers did was ridiculous!

 I ordered a grilled fish sandwich that lacked flavor and was horrible greasy, the fried scallops were disgusting.

I understand that the restaurant has seen better days but wow, will i be going back, methinks not!"}
{"text":"Great place for tourist, locals, old timers looking to reminisce, etc. Cool neon sign from outside...one of the coolest on the square! When you enter, you immediately feel like you stepped back in time: black and white photos, tile floors, stools at the stainless steel bar. Even the lighting is well done.

Drink prices are perfect if you order something like a draft or basic drink.  Grab an iron city!

Food prices aren't expensive either. I didn't eat there, but their fish sandwich seems like their most popular item!

I sat at the bar for 30 mins, saw a handful of people come in and out, and only heard friendly conversation and comments. Great place for being the oldest on the square!"}
{"text":"Since my last review, the Oyster House has take two menu moves which I do not care for. First they have begun using thinner fillets of fish. Secondly. They have changed the breading in a way that seems make the fish more greasy. Lastly, they have switched to an egg bun which doesn't go at all with fried fish. The bun is to sweet and crumbly. 

Guys, I'll bet you've seen a decline in sales since you made these changes....GO BACK TO THE SANDWICH YOU MADE FOR OVER 35 YEARS.....PLEASE."}
{"text":"Hi.  The four star rating is for the staff and the old time ambiance. We went in last week for my birthday meal and we totally enjoyed ourselves. The food came out hot and quickly. It isn't gourmet eating but that isn't important as we went to experience the oldest bar in Pittsburgh -- that's  what makes the Original Oyster House a memorable reason to go to."}
{"text":"I ate here today for lunch and it was good. It is not a 4 Star restaurant by no means. They serve food on foam plates and give you plastic utensils. 

The best thing about this place is the fact that they have good food at a very good price. I dont think you will find a better deal in The Market."}
{"text":"It's been there for a lot of years I remember going to eat there as a kid in the 70s and the decor hasn't changed. I really like the fish themed decor the only problem is there is no street parking but you can park at the many parking garages which are about 7.00 an hour. Market square where it is located is really nice and looks a lot better than the 70s. The prices are high but it's in Downtown Pittsburgh and they have a great reputation."}
{"text":"Best fish sandwich in Pittsburgh.  Yummy oysters too! Always a great meal here.  Always sit at the bar. Even when I was a kid and my Dad took me there,  we always sat at the bar.  Great bartenders.  Awesome ambience,  old school, great place."}
{"text":"Was visiting Pittsburgh and saw this place on a walk. Since it was Pittsburghs oldest seafood place I figured they must be doing something right. WRONG!! 
Everything tasted like it was prepackaged  store brought. Costco has better shrimp. Fried oysters? Never tasted an oyster in any bite, only breading. 
My mistake for not reading the reviews before I tried this place."}
{"text":"I don't like seafood. At all. But I like this Pittsburgh landmark. I've been going for years. Why would someone who doesn't eat fish do this? I'll tell you why, because I love the chicken tenders and fries!! Yes just like a kid, I love them. There's nothing unique or fancy about this meal but something about the way it's cooked up makes it delicious. Maybe it's the pride the employees seem to take in what I call job well done. Can't go to Market Square without stopping in."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY! Stopped for lunch on a visit to Pittsburgh and wasn't impressed. The fish and chips were decent and hot out of the fryer, but I didn't like the calamari breading or lack of tentacles with the bodies. I also had to change my son's diaper, and we were told we couldn't do it in the bathrooms (no changing tables), but our waitress cleared chairs off an unused table and said she let patrons change their kids that way all the time. We have a changing pad and I assume they wipe the tables down, but still...invest in a changing table and stop letting people put their kid's asses where we eat. I then tied and sealed the diaper in a plastic bag we carry for that purpose and tossed it in the trash. The waitress was then upset because \"it would be there for days.\" Ok, well, take your trash out more often? You do scrape food into that barrel, do you not? I assume several days of rotting food you haven't removed smells worse than a contained pissy diaper? Hard pass on coming back here."}
{"text":"Awesome place for lunch. A local cop recommended the place as a good local spot.  Been here since the 50's. Very casual they service in paper plates. I had the cod father fish sandwich. VERY fresh and tasty, light batter.  Delicious. Fast and way friendly service from Terri. Hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"This place isnt 5 stars because its fancy or absolutely delicious. It is 5 stars because the staff was fast and friendly. Food arrived correct and hot. The place is CHEAP considering the area it is in. I mean $6 for a shrimp basket with fries or onion rings. The beer was $3.50 which is cool. The clam chowder cup is big enough you dont need a bowl unless thats all you are going to order. Also they memorabilia on the wall is worth looking at."}
{"text":"The good: I'll eat anything they want to batter and fry up, all the fried food was steaming, crispy, flavorful, tender, and delicious. Portions are large, I got the \"fish nuggets\", I expected tiny nibbles but was pleasantly surprised by prepared mountains of battered fish the size of my fists.

Prices are extremely reasonable, my wife and I happily stuffed ourselves and got drinks for under $30.   The prices are good anywhere, but especially for  the prime downtown hot spot of market square.  The Oyster House is Pittsburgh's oldest bar and restaurant, and has been featured in several movies over the years.  They have lots of vintage photos hanging on the wall.  The staff is gruff, but friendly, true Pittsburghers.

The bad: As I mentioned, it was founded in 1870, and it doesn't appear to have been updated since, it felt run down. The atmosphere is lacking, they serve you with paper plates and plastic utensils.  Anything not fried was mediocre.  The crab cakes and deviled crab were oversalted.  They don't serve Heinz Ketchup which seems wrong given both their historical heritage and that they are located about 100 feet away from the Heinz Global HQ in PPG.

Would I go back to the Original Oyster?  Sure!  Great portions, low prices, tasty food.  I want to try the \"Monster Fish Sandwich\" which is supposedly Moby Dick sized (eat it before it eats you!)  But if you're looking for a high end experience with classy atmosphere, this isn't the place.  It's a good bar with good bar food, go in with the right expectations and you'll be well satisfied."}
{"text":"A group of friends came here after the Pittsburgh Marathon and must say had a great time. They opened early in order to accomodate the runners and their appetites. (first +)

The drinks were priced far below that of the neighboring competition. (Second +)

I'm a vegetarian, so most of the menu was off limits for me, but since it was my first visit here i had to try something. Ended up ordering the onion rings and fries - Best i've ever had. (third +)

The service was amazing. Mary, the kitchen manager, was beyond wonderful. Kept the food being delivered to the tables, kept the drinks filled, and smiled about it the whole time. The other servers (apologize for not knowing their names) were awesome as well. They treated everyone in our group and others around us wonderfully. (fourth +)

Mary has been there for 35 of the restaurant's 144 years, and loves every moment of it. i will definitely be going back to this place for the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"A friendly place with great seafood.  It is cash only. The clam chowder was meaty and creamy.  The onion rings were crispy and so was the fish. A nice place to see local flair"}
{"text":"It's a cash only place. Love coming here. Welcoming & great food. It's really old school Pittsburgh - so it's very blue collar kind of atmosphere. Just about everything is fried but is fabulously good. Beer is cheap & a decent selection."}
{"text":"An Uber driver recommended this place to my friend and me. It's a small place, but you can tell it has a history (as it is the oldest bar and restaurant in town). I've only ever had the salmonburger; it was cheap but delicious. The serving was on the small side, so I would recommend getting a side with the order. Heads up: CASH ONLY. There's a PNC ATM in the square if you need it. :)"}
{"text":"We were excited to try the Original Oyster House given its history and nice outdoor seating in market square. We were prepared for foam plates and cash only, which works for a nice lunch outside. Sadly we were disappointed with our meal. Our group of 3 tried the breaded oysters, famous fried fish, beer-battered fish nuggets, and crab cakes with fries and onion rings. Although the portions were generous for being fried, much of the food was soggy due to the excess of grease. We were in an area with a server, but the service was terrible. Our server continually ignored us and frequently forgot items she was supposed to bring to the point that we went inside to get the items ourselves. The food is a good deal if you are willing to overlook the service and like really greasy fried seafood."}
{"text":"We heard Oysters and our mouths were watering... then we looked at the menu and hardly saw any oysters! If you're looking for fresh shucked oysters on the half shell or a variety of oyster options... this is not the place for you. It was a pretty run-of-the-mill seafood joint with less than exciting options. Everything was decent enough, including the crab cakes and fried oyster platter. I was just hoping for something special. Fried oysters and onion rings were more breaded than actual substance, the green beans seemed to be poured right out of a can. If you're looking for a decent meal in Market Square, it wasn't bad... just didn't hit it out of the park for us."}
{"text":"Worst dinner ever! I was hungry and couldn't stomach this. Wow. So disappointed. To put into perspective, McDonalds is better than this. Save yourself."}
{"text":"Suuuuper disappointed! Expected some amazing fried/breaded oysters, because of the name of course...

When the oysters came out, they didn't even look like oysters. They were very flat...thinner than your typical frozen chicken nugget. Not much oyster taste, just the taste of the breading. The most enjoyable part of the meal was the cocktail sauce...surprisingly very good.

Beer was also a bit pricey for a place like this...$5 for a yeungling draft. =\ 

CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"The Original Oyster House is a restaurant I've been intending to visit for quite some time, and finally got around to trying last evening.  Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed.  As you walk in, it comes across as a bit of a small, a little bit dingy, diner.  I have no problem with that, I happen to love diners, but it's not what I would expect from a place I am hoping to get good seafood.  The selection for beer with dinner was rather limited (but let's face it we weren't going there for beer, it's just something I noticed)  The service was seriously lacking.  When asking for our order, the waitress was literally on her cell phone.  I could never tell if she was paying attention to us or not.   

I also found the set-up of the restaurant to be rather lacking.  It feels very claustrophobic, and while we were sitting up at the counter, a number of people bumped into me due to the fact that there is very little room to walk around.  

Now, as far as the food goes, nothing was BAD, but it wasn't stellar.  Nothing on the menu seemed to be \"Great\" to me.  I ordered clam strips, and there was absolutely nothing special about them whatsoever.  They are the same clam strips I could get anywhere else I were to ever go.  There was no extra flavoring, no pizazz, nothing.  Just some strips of clam fried up.  Same goes for the french fries.  Now, the green beans I got were of note, because they were really gross.  There was no flavoring added to them whatsoever, they were just plain, boring, soggy green beans.  I was very much let down.

So all in all, if you are looking for something quick and find yourself downtown, the Original Oyster House is perfectly acceptable.  If you are looking for some place that makes very unique, delicious seafood meals, find something else."}
