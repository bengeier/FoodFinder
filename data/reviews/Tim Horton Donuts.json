{"text":"Nice and clean.. Even the bathrooms. Its a Tim's!!! the place does attract the usual types of people.. but if you don't mind a little crazy, its a good place to get your Tim's Fix."}
{"text":"This place is quick and always pack with locals. They seem to have my donuts or muffins that I craved. Which is a bonus. It's a little tight inside, but I think they manage.  What makes this unique, is it's famous for it's huge parking lot, which enable car meets to happen outside. Great sights if you wanna see great rides. It's also a great meet up and a place to wait for the bus for fallsview casino.  The very best thing for this is, that it's also hidden. So locals can really hang out here with out the tourist taking over lines and taking all the delicious timbits! Great location!"}
{"text":"This Tim Horton's on the corner of Steeles Ave East, and Woodbine Avenue in Markham is easily once of the most polarizing Tim Horton's in the province.  It is located within the Esso gas station, and up until this past October it was very small (even by gas station standards).  I say it's polarizing as I work almost next door and I am privy to many a conversations about this location.  Either people love it, or they hate it.  This location is already disadvantaged because quite literally, there is another Tim Horton's inside an Esso gas station on the opposite side of Woodbine.  Furthermore, there is a full-size Tim Horton's within a 3 minute walk on the south side of Steeles Ave East in the ING Direct building.  With that said, any weekday morning this location is PACKED.  By packed, I mean out-the-door packed; comparable to the trading floor on Bay Street.     What makes this store so polarizing is the staff.  My personal experience with the staff has been nothing but terrific.  Within my 3rd time of visiting in the mornings (when I went regularly,  I have had long-term stints of this being MY go-to morning routine coffee shop over the past 6 years.  Currently it is my \"on the way home\" coffee shop, but it's a ghost town any time after 3 pm.  ) they had my order memorized, prepared, and punched into the cash register before I even walked up to the counter.  It was uncanny the memory the main woman had at being able to see a face 3 people back in line and know exactly what they wanted.  I can't count the times I have seen it happen.  Even though they are rushing through people faster than the metal detector people at a Leafs game, they maintain a certain efficient freidnliness.  I have heard many different stories about the staff, and what it boils down to is: if they like you; your are treated exceptionally.  If they don't, well, you get the bum's rush so to speak.  Me personally, I can say that I haven't had a terrible experience.  I have had the odd coffee prepared incorrectly, or the wrong cream cheese on the bagel, but nothing to turn me away.    If I had to sum up this place in one word, I would say efficient.   They probably run through 300 customers between 7am and 9am.  Truly amazing."}
{"text":"I know it's a Tim Horton's inside Sq1, but the last 2 times that I've been here they: 1)  Didn't have what I order (iced coffee).  Yes, it's later on in the afternoon during my visit, but it's the middle of Summer.  How do you not have enough? 2)  Don't have the size I order.  Today, there was no small cups, so they gave me medium.  I do appreciate this value substitution, but it's more than I can drink. 3)  Had \"iced coffee\" that was luke warm, put in medium sized cup, because they didn't have small again.  So it's hit 'n miss.  I'm sure if you go earlier on in the day, they're well stocked.  However, if you're someone who enjoys a COLD caffeinated beverage later on in the afternoon, you may be hard pressed/delighted with the 'deal' that you're getting!  P.S.  Don't be surprised if there's a line 'cause this is a busy location inside the mall, just outside the lower level of Walmart."}
{"text":"tim hortons is always a 4+ in my heart! i mean yes u do run into slow/mean servers but it is my fav coffee shop good location b/c it's at the esso station right off the highway"}
{"text":"This location is right beside my work and the servers remember my orders and always accute, even though there is lineup at times, but was expected during rush hours."}
{"text":"Good coffee especially when you get the dark roast version.  This is a very busy location which is nestled close to Square One shopping centre.  My visits here usually entail me running in to buy coffee and occasionally Timbits and the service here is quick and efficient."}
