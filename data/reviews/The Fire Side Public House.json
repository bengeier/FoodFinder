{"text":"The entire bar smells like a cozy campfire, which can be a bit much when you first walk in, but  after a minute or two I thoroughly enjoyed it. We came for drinks/snacks with friends. As someone who enjoys trying different beers, I was really excited to be able to order 8oz beers for exactly half the price of a pint. The draft list is pretty long and has a great variety to choose from! My fiance ordered from the cocktail list and was impressed with the quality of the drinks. The fries with beer cheese and bacon were a great accompaniment to the beer! We also ordered the s'mores, which were nice and toasty but, in my opinion, could have had more chocolate. The service was also good. I definitely plan to return!"}
{"text":"Great little spot for barbeque, steaks, burgers, etc. with a good selection of craft beers.  We loved the smell of the wood fired grill the minute you walk in.  Good service and great food!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a whim...wanted to support a Local establishment.  The kielbasa and pierogi  was excellent, although I am not a fan of deep fried pierogis - just a little too rich for me. My husband got the 1/2 rack of baby back ribs and he loved it!!! The fries were awesome and the green beans were fresh and crispy... Just the way we like them.   The best thing about the place was the service. Our waitress was friendly, sweet and not some obnoxious person who thinks they are \"too good for this job and way cooler than we are\" ! Ha ha. We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since I live nearby and miss station street. The hostess was super friendly and pleasant. In fact the friendliness of the staff was one of the few bright spots today. Drinks: cocktail menu has fun names and a few standard drinks and some interesting mixtures. Unfortunate to see sours mix listed. Not really a place for a cocktail menu laden with high end ingredients,  but a nice menu worth a look and definitely something for everyone.  The draft beer selection has a lot of local and PA brews with some good seasonals.  They have a nice late night happy hour- $4 for any 16 oz beer below 7% abv.  The beer bottles seem overpriced, with a grapefruit sculpin coming in at 8.50. This is a good place for beers after 9 pm. 

The service was odd. Beers and food came out strangely timed.. Almost one item at a time so one person sat with no drink or entree.  

The food was alright. Some kitchen mixups resulted in one app being doubled and the other showing up very late. Disappointed by the wings overall and I left with a stomach ache. 

Burger was way overcooked and things like small plates for appetizers and new forks were hard to come by. 

Once they work out the kinks in the kitchen it might turnaround. We need something in the area,  so I am hooeful.  

While the food was not the best tonight,  I might return because the staff was so nice and for the draft beer specials."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and ambiance. Ample parking. Nice draft list. Indifferent service. Scary bad food.  Two out of three of us got sick from it."}
{"text":"It's a gastropub, but not like the kind you're used to. Small tables and big windows around a long, massive bar. Maybe a little noisy, but that's just the layout of the place. Menu was diverse enough without being overwhelming. Beer and whiskey selection was excellent. Service was very quick considering I went on a Saturday night when it was crowded and there was only one bartender working.  
  
The smell of meat cooked over a camp fire lingered on my shirt for two days. I wanted to eat my own shirt."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, decent and friendly service. 

Bland food... sounds great on menu and looks great when delivered to table... just oddly not flavorful (peanut butter bacon burger, house salad, gouda cream macaroni all tasted like nothing in particular). 

Clothes/hair smell like I had been to smoking bar afterwards, too.

I really want to like this place, will try again in a few months."}
{"text":"To start off, everything was bland. 
I ordered the Mac and cheese.  It was disgusting. It was more like a soupy pasta dish.  There was no flavor, no cheese and no apologies from any of the staff, including the manager.  I found this to be very poor service.  
The black and yellow burger was missing it's blackening seasoning, but the onions on the burger gave it some flavor."}
{"text":"Fantastic gastropub tucked away behind Target in Shadyside/East Liberty. The food was very good, reasonably priced, and they had good happy hour specials. Location not the best, but worth the effort! They do have at least one TV and the open fire oven/grill is entertaining!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a hidden gem. Been here a few times and always had a good time and good service. Really interesting and unique place. The food was great as well."}
{"text":"Service was good and the beers were great. That's all that I can say positive about the place. The place is tiny and crowded and can make anyone feel claustrophobic. We ordered an appetizer and two entrees and everything was crazy bland. I had to pour salt and pepper to get the dishes to edible status. Temperature of all the dishes was luke warm at best and even was missing some of the ingredients listed on the menu. I was really excited about this place because we love Sidelines and was looking forward to a new twist but will not be coming back...especially since I will smell like a campfire for the next 48 hours."}
{"text":"Eh. The tap list is the best thing, I think. Large selection. Unfortunately, there were some issues with all of our appetizers and entrees. 

Our appetizers, the hush puppies and corn dip, were both over-salted. 

Our entrees were all bland. Two burgers had little to no seasoning and zero smokey, campfire flavor despite the wood burning grill in the open kitchen. The fries tasted under-cooked and like they were from frozen.The portobello caprese \"salad\" is four slices of tomato, barely a whole mushroom cap, some feta, a little bit of basil, and not worth the $13 price tag. My father got the shrimp and grits, the shrimp was overcooked and the grits were a bland mush that he didn't finish (note my family and I are from North Carolina, so we know grits). 

Our server, Tiffanie, was attentive and very nice and did ask why he didn't finish the grits. She also took it off the bill.

Overall, kind of a disappointing meal, though."}
{"text":"I was particularly excited when this opened since it's convenient and parking is ample.  It used to be Station Street Hotdogs.  The atmosphere is relaxed and casual, but the decor is modern and they use high-quality ingredients.  I love the cocktail menu, which is based on Will Ferrell movies right now (Elf and Step Brothers).  Cocktails are a little expensive, but beers are cheaper and they run specials each week.  I have had burgers and nachos there--both very solid.  The \"small plates\" aren't really small, so watch out!  Mac and cheese or nachos are big enough to share with two.  Servers are very friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of the best bbq joints I've been to. Had the half rack of ribs - had so much meat on them and they were done perfectly. Grill right in the middle of the restaurant - smells so good!  Skillet cake for dessert - YUM!  And a great beer list to boot!"}
{"text":"We went in thinking they were closing in an hour but were closing in 15 min. They were super friendly and served us great drinks and nachos!  Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't aware of this place, but based on a recommendation, we decided to check it out. I think it is relatively new and looks like it might have been an old diner building.

Checked this place out on a Saturday night. Wait staff very friendly and attentive. We had the chicken nachos, which have smoked chicken that isn't too over-powering and the Peanut butter burger. I can't say enough good things about the burger...the peanut butter had hints of a thai peanut sauce vs. standard pb. The grass fed burger was perfectly cooked and not at all greasy. Extensive list of craft beers on tap. And ample parking in a parking lot, which is so clutch for the area. Will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"It seems like Pittsburgh has endless new burger/beer spots opening, and we had high hopes for Fireside based on their location/beer list/menu...turns out they still have a lot of kinks to work out. If they fixed some simple cooking things and tightened up service, they could be a solid four stars. 

The good:
-solid beer list, very good prices, half size pours
-parking!
-cozy, albeit generic vibe 

The not so good:
-veggie burger was ice cold  
-out of avocado (we both ordered things with avocado, weren't told until after the food came)
-gave us the wrong beer 
-took a long time for food to come out, despite being only half full - never got checked on afterwards 
-the vent on the wood grill must not be strong enough - we were sitting a good distance away and came home smelling like a camp fire"}
{"text":"I love FIre Side Public house.. it's not on a main drag so it's easy to miss, but I sort of hope it stays that way for awhile. It's still new so it's like a well kept secret.. for now. The middle of the bar is a wood fire grill, which is so entrancing to watch as you're sipping a drink. All the food is prepared in front of you, which is fun and nice to know how things are made.. there's no secrets or microwaves. The taps are versatile and the bartenders are super friendly and willing to make recommendations. Also, one of my favorite things is the fact that there is like one TV in the WHOLE bar.. which is SO nice. I was so hoping that it wasn't going to be another sports bar, something pittsburgh DOESNT need. and it delivered completely.. people are actually in conversation and not absentmindedly staring at the boob tube. Lastly, the food was REALLLLYYYY good. I will definitely we back soon!"}
{"text":"Good sandwich , great fries, great service by the friendly bartender, waitress Molly......."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and can say that I really like what these guys are doing.  The layout is like an old diner with a large open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant.  The decor though is modern.  There is an open fire, wood burning grill in the middle of the kitchen. They have about 40 beers on tap with fairly good variety and quality.  They also have a nice cocktail list and are happy to make something off the menu if you tell them what you're looking for.  

We came for wing night once (monday) and tried several different preparations, all grilled, though they do fry wings if you want. On Monday's they have 3-4 additional sauces in addition to the three on the menu.  I think the maple bacon siracha was my favorite.  My only complaint is that they spicy ones (including one labeled \"inferno\") were not very spicy.

Another night we came to try the burgers.  I had the fireside burger which comes with bacon on it and thought it was excellently prepared.  The accompanying French fries were also good.

Overall, the prices are very reasonable (I like the option to get a half pint of beer), though they would benefit from an expanded happy hour (to include beer).  The service at the bar has been great, but the one time we sat at a table or waitress struggled a little.  Recently, I was told they plan to expand their menu shortly."}
{"text":"I hate to give a two star but this place needs to get their act together in the kitchen.  Our poor server was dealing with a kitchen that seemed to produce the food in mere random order. Two of our three  meals were served first, then after they were nearly finished with their meal, my food arrived. After waiting another 10 minutes, the apps arrived! 

We ended up boxing the apps and leaving.  The server was very polite and apologetic but they need some serious leadership in the kitchen.  Too bad as I liked their menu."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. I got the crab cake salad and it was super yummy! My boyfriend got the wings and you can tell that they are good quality and that the sauce is home made. We didn't get a chance to try any of the beers or cocktails but they had a great selection. Staff was friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came for the beer always judge a burger based on how they cook it medium rare and this place knows what they are doing!!  I had the Sarah burger with bacon and egg and it didn't disappoint. Well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The fries were slight over done (a plus) and just thrighr amount of salt .  I ventured in on a Thursday and it was kinda dead atmosphere wise. Only 10 people in there at 8:45 and that is the only reason I did not give 5 stars.  Will be back"}
{"text":"I've been to this place four times, so I feel like I am ready to pass judgment.    Let me start off with what is good:  the burgers and the beer selection.  Now for the bad.  If you are looking for anything else besides burgers and beer,  skip this place.   Besides a burger,  the other menu items I've tried are: grilled chicken caesar, pepperoni flatbread, and wings.   Grilled chicken caesar came with finely chopped romaine (wha?) and the romaine itself wasnt grilled as the menu said it would be.  The flatbread was awful.  Ragu sauce on a small strip of pita bread served barely warm.  The wings were rubbery and also barely warm.   Service:  if you want good service be seated near the waitress station at the bar otherwise your waiter will fly by you before you notice.  Acoustics:  The acoustics here are equivalent to a high school gymnasium.  Had a hard time hearing my dinner companion sitting across from me,  and on one visit,  the waiter got my order wrong because he misheard me."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the good reviews I'm seeing here. I went to the Fireside with friends and it was terrible. The food was barely bar food, unseasoned, hugely overcooked, and then literally flooded with sauce. Our sandwiches had so much sauce on them that they fell apart just trying to pick them up! The appetizers were the same way, with flavorless bits swimming in an actual bowl of sauce. We watched in disbelief as eat plate of food that the kitchen made was plated and then covered with one sauce after another until it was unrecognizable. Worse, the sauces are almost flavorless. I cannot imagine anyone with kitchen experience allowing plates like that to be served.

The beer at Fireside was good, but our server could not have known less about it, or any of their drinks. His first approach was to ask us if we had decided on drinks yet, only to slowly realize that we had no menus or way to order. Once we got menus, several of us had questions, none of which he had any notion of. He didn't know ingredients of drinks, the differences in any of the beers, or even how much drinks cost, as it was not listed. \"They are regular drink prices,\" was the quote of the night.

I'll say that one start was for the wonderful smell of open wood fire when you walk in. If you have to go, enjoy that smell, then go somewhere else. You'll be happier for it."}
{"text":"This place is just consistently fantastic. The wood fire grilled foods made with fresh local ingredients are Devine. The service is friendly, laid back, and quite attentive. The staff is amazing. You cannot beat their bar menu. Music fantastic. There's always a comfy seat with no fuss. Highly recommend the street corn and Tacos on taco Tuesday. I actually said to my partner, \" I'm torn. I wanna do them a solid and give em a good review....but I don't want people to \"discover\" this place\"."}
{"text":"Chicken nachos and burgers were soooo good!  Pastas weren't very flavorful though.   First time we went was a quiet Monday night and service was wonderful.   The second time we went on a Friday evening,  service was atrocious.   The server left our plates on our table long after we were done with appetizers, same with drink glasses, and she never checked on us after our food came out.   Finally, it took forever for our dinner to arrive and there was never an apology by the waitress or even explaining why it took nearly an hour between appetizers and dinner.   Disappointing that the manager never came by either to apologize.   Service and management leaves a lot to be desired for.   Otherwise, very cool place with good appetizers and burgers!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended: we have been several times for lunch, but never for dinner. 

The staff is consistently friendly and gracious, and the kitchen has been consistently excellent. Lunch service is light: we have never had to wait even though the house consists of a server and a gent running the kitchen, and as best we can tell, that's it. The server advised us that they up-staff pretty dramatically for evening service. 

The Arancini look like they should be dense little balls of croquette, but instead they are wonderfully light and airy. The butter sauce goes with them nicely, and the bacon is a fun addition.

The crab and bacon hush puppies are served with a Cajun cream foam that covers lovely bacon and corn. Looking at them in cross-section, you would presume that you're about to bite into a mess of heavy bread but instead you are delighted to find every bite is unequivocally crabby without being over done.

The wedge salad is enough for three people.

The chicken nachos are delicious. The portion is large enough to provide a full meal for two, and appetizers for five or six.

There are 20+ draughts with a broad and varied selection, and there is a perfectly reasonable wine selection matched to the fare. Fireside is not a cocktail bar. 

We haven't tried all of the sandwiches on the menu, but have been quite pleased with the ones we have. 

Peruse the menu before you take your kids -- I think that many kids would find plenty to suit them, but not all."}
{"text":"Good ingredients poorly prepared.  They could be a great place but they don't really know what they are doing.  Service was dreadfully slow so we skipped dessert. (the best part of our fire side experience was driving to whole foods for a chocolate cake.  probably faster than ordering something there and probably better tasting)

The atmosphere is LOUD.  I like to have pleasant conversation with my beer and it was not happening there.

The ingredients they use are decent quality, but whomever is cooking them doesn't have a clue how to use them.  Our hand cut fries were stale.  How the hell do you serve stale fries?  And half the menu was \"out of stock\".

Draft beer selection was great (40 drafts), as was the option for half sized beers so you can taste several."}
{"text":"Came to Pittsburgh from out of town, needing a place to gather 15 friends for drinks, nibbles, and good cheer. Fireside staff was extremely accommodating on not only a holiday weekend but a potential busy Valentines brunch hour. Giving us full claim to their back seating area for over two hours, they took great care of our party with drinks and appetizers. Highlights were the crab and bacon hush puppies, Korean buffalo wings and Gouda chicken mac. Perfect bloody Mary's and the \"Paint chip\" cocktail was delightful!The hamburgers were juicy and good grill flavor. Peach cobbler and Campfire s'mores skillets were excellent! Highly recommend coming in a large group or date night. Fireside will treat you right!!

(Free parking was added bonus)"}
{"text":"Great place! Stopped by for a weekday lunch. I had the fire side burger with fries. Will certainly return."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Very welcoming from the time I arrived. I ordered the Quebec Burger. It was pretty amazing!!! I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night for dinner with friends. We all ordered flatbreads. The food took an extremely long time to come out when we were the only ones in the restaurant. The descriptions of the flatbreads were very unclear and I was unhappy with mine. My friend ordered the sausage flatbread and it was so burnt it was almost inedible. I sent mine back. The waiter was very nice and apologetic and allowed me to order something else. However, by the time my quesadilla cane out, my friends had been finished with their meals for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Their food is great!  I adored the grilled wings with the dry rub.  My picky Dad loved his cheese steak sandwich as well!  The prices are super affordable considering the quality of food you receive."}
{"text":"The only negative of my review ... 5 people with reservations were squished into a corner and the resolution offered was a table outside with dropping temperatures in a sketchy/up in coming neighborhood.

Otherwise excellent experience.  We arrived during happy hour ... discounts on appetizers and Pennsylvania beers.

We were a diverse group.  The corn on the cob had rave reviews ... as did the lettuce wraps, pierogies, mushrooms stuffed with crabmeat, steak hoagie, brushetta, artisan bread, and nachos.  I highly recommend the house salad with blueberry vinegarette.

We were not rushed through our meal.  Definitely will be returning.

Ample free parking"}
{"text":"I went for Wing Night. The wings were alright,  but I'm thinking it's because they were just different. The service wasnt good!  It's unfortunate that the cooks couldn't serve you, because they were cool. However, the reason this place got 4 stars is because of the wood fire corn. Listen, that corn was the best thing I have had in a long  time. I ate it so fast that I don't even think I was breathing lol. Go get the corn! !"}
{"text":"What a treat to visit! The Fire Side Public House is an awesome addition to the myriad of trendy restaurants in East Liberty. The restaurant is located in a weird place in East Liberty where it is somewhat separated from the rest of the restaurants located on Highland/Centre/etc. so you get a *lovely* view of the back of Target's parking lot and the busway lol.

Anyways, the food is absolutely wonderful and the draft list has many options of great beers. I ordered the Black and Yellow Burger which has bacon and caramelized onions on it. I think caramelized onions are literally made of crack so I thought the burger was absolutely delicious! In addition to having awesome burgers, FSPH has some of the best fries I've ever had too. I think they use some type of pepper or other spice but they do something to their fries that make them extra addictive!

The only issue I had with Fire Side was that the service was rather slow even for the non-busy night I went and that the server mixed up the beers me and the other person I came with ordered. Otherwise, I loved Fire Side Public House and I totally recommend. I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner a few weeks ago after a happy hour. I work in East Liberty and have been wanting to try this place for a while. We arrived there around 8 on a Friday night and we were able to be seated right away. We had the choice of sitting at \"bar\" which overlooked wood fire cooking area. However, we opted for a high top table by a window. First of all, there were so many things on the menu that I wanted to try so I had a hard time deciding what to order. I went with the Buffalo Chicken Grilled Cheese and my boyfriend got the skillet pasta. Our food came out very quickly and it was so delicious! My grilled cheese had a kick from the buffalo sauce, but the chicken had that wood fire taste... Yum! We ordered the campfire smores for dessert. It came out in a little cast iron skillet. It had a layer of chocolate, then some Golden Grahams, and then all of that goodness was topped with roasted marshmallows! Amazing!! Finally, (because like I said, I couldn't decide on what I wanted!), I ordered the roasted corn dip to take home. I ate it the next day with the Parmesan pita chips and oh em gee.... It was delicious! I will definitely be back again! 

On top of everything else, the staff is so friendly and accommodating! We had a very great experience overall!"}
{"text":"I definitely dig the Fire Side. Upon first entry you're greeted by the smell of a wood fire that's in the middle of the bar area. There is a small amount of tables lining the wall, and a big wrap around bar. Seating large parties may be a problem, especially during busy times. But seating 4 for a Saturday lunch was fine. There is a decent beer list, and a list of specialty cocktails as well. The food however, was excellent! We started with an order of the nachos, and they were phenomenal. Beer cheese all over them, and layered as well so you dont just end up with a pile of chips. I ordered the Steak burger and wow, it was so good. I ended up taking the bun off of the second half of it because I really wanted to finish it. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great addition to East Liberty!

I had never been to Station Street Hot Dogs so I was excited to check out its replacement. After a Saturday at the mall of shopping with my daughter we were famished. My fellow Yelp buddy Rochelle H. told me about The Fire Side Public House just opening the day before and that they were doing a \"soft opening\" and that all of the food was comped as long as you bought a drink (pop, beer etc.) so my daughter and I high tailed it over there to meet up with Rochelle and her daughter and check the place out! 

Upon entering we were greeted and asked to be seated right next to Rochelle and her daughter. Surprisingly the place wasn't packed at all. A few seconds later Dane C. our waiter came over and took our drink orders. The concept of the restaurant is all about the wood fire grill that sits in the middle of the restaurant that everything is cooked on. They also specialize in craft beer. The menu consists of Small Bits, Wings, Wood Grill Items, Salads and Skillet served items for now will more items to be added once the restaurant is running at full capacity.
 
My daughter started off with the Beer Cheese & Bacon Fires (Fresh cut fries, Apple Wood Bacon and Smoked Cheddar Beer Cheese) off the Small plates menu and I went with the Smoked Chicken Nachos. (Apple Wood Smoked Chicken, tortilla chips, grilled corn, black beans, sour cream, salsa verde and avocado.) I also added a order of grilled Garlic Parmesan wings. A few minutes later our small plates came. Let me tell you that there is nothing small about the Smoked Chicken Nachos portions! It could easily feed two to three people! I only ate about half. My daughter loved her Beer Cheese Fries as well.

For our main dishes my daughter choose the Fire Side Burger (Grass Fed Beef, Apple Wood Bacon, pickles, White Cheddar, lettuce, tomato and onions on a Brioche Bun). I choose the Chicken Skillet Pasta (Chicken Sausage, fire roasted tomatoes, Basil infused cream, Pappardelle and Fontina Cheese). It was absolutely delicious! I took a bite of my daughters burger and let me just say that I was one of the best burgers I have ever tasted! I finally got my wings after my main food already came. It was the place's second night being open so I will cut them some slack. 

After we were done with our meals we had to try the desserts. My daughter ordered the Campfire S 'Mores (Fire Roasted Marshmallows, milk chocolate, and Honey Grahams cereal). I picked the Blueberry Cobbler. The blueberry cobbler was simply spectacular! My daughter must of loved her S 'Mores as she finished it before I could even taste it! 

Dane C. took excellent care of was the entire evening and never let our glasses get more than a quarter empty before he brought us another Pepsi. My only complaint it that the wings need to come out a lot faster then there are now. I'm sure once the kinks get worked out that this will be rectified.

I also had the pleasure of meeting the owner Robert Miller who also owns Sidelines Bar & Grille. He was very appreciative for my critiques,  ideas and feedback.

I think the restaurants concept will be welcomed with open arms by the East Liberty community."}
{"text":"I want to love this place..I really do. They source local and I love that. Bottom line is they are overwhelmed and understaffed. I've been here before and it still holds true that they have a great beer selection and food is pretty good but...This time was not great. Sat for over 20mins before even getting a drink order in. By that point we ordered  food and drinks all at once. Took about 50 mins to get our food. Then 5 mins later after getting our entrees our appetizer arrived... there are literally two guys cooking and one waitress on staff. Just not acceptable. Granted she is only one person, but because of that service sucks. She was nice and personable and again no complaints about the food at all, but until they get fully staffed this place doesn't have much promise.."}
{"text":"Wings were so good, the bacon maple sriracha and parm garlic were enjoyed by our entire group. The pierogie was fried, first time having it this way, very different than normal preparation I'm used to, but a tasty surprise. The fries with gravy and curds did not disappoint. We also got the cobb salad, you know, to feel somewhat healthy by our party. The only bad part of the meal was the corn dip. Based on photos other people had posted we also got the corn dip to go. What we received was the dregs of the corn dip. There was a layer of separated grease floating on what looked like curdled milk and corn. It was a bummer. Beyond that, the meal was great and was ready for pickup extremely fast. Check this out if staying in town."}
{"text":"Eh at best. Literally 6 people in the whole place and it took forever to get .... wings and the surf n turf. With that being said, the presentation was definitely reminiscent of my grandma putting food on the plate. You could probably spend a little more time making it pretty. As far as taste goes it was ok. Nothing to write home about but not terrible. Really nothing I consider a draw here. Very over priced for eh."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today, it was not too crowded.  There was a large group seated before us, but our waitress was hustling and so were the chefs.  It's really cool that you can see the kitchen from every seat in the dining area.  It was clean, open, and inviting.  Not much as far as decor, but the food was really good.  We started with the crab hush puppies, they were hot, crispy, tasted like crab, had a great spicy sauce, fresh corn, some bacon, great started.  There were 4 of them.  There were other items I'd like to try, so many items on the menu sounded so good.  I had the Triple B Burger, it was good, but a bit drier than medium, I prefer mine a bit more pink.  The brioche was soft, nicely toasted, large tomato, two large slices of bacon, wished there was more Blackberry BBQ sauce, but it was good.  My mom had the grilled crab cake, it looked great.  My stepfather had the wildfire burger.  The fries were great, fresh cut, lightly salted, just the right amount of soft and crispy.  Nice selection of drafts.  I look forward to going there again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend. I got the salmon sandwich, he ordered the chicken sandwich. Both had interesting descriptions on the menu, however neither delivered. Very sparse ingredients pretty much hidden between two large slices of bread. The was no quality or expertise used in the preparation. Pretty much slapped together and served with cold greasy fries. 
As I started to look around I could see they really don't seem to be concerned about being really clean. Counters were not wiped well as neither was the floor. A filthy trash can was being used to hold a box of food the cook was using. All not good signs.
Waiter was pleasant.
Definitely not worth the price paid."}
{"text":"You will have that delicious wood burnt smell permeating your clothes when you leave. If you can't handle that, then this isn't the place for you. 

My friend and I tried this place after being fans of Station Street and wanting somewhere with parking (yay!) and new to try. At first the hostess station can be misleading. There wasn't a designated hostess but a waitress who later sat us. We watched other people walk in with a similar reaction and seat themselves. The waitress who sat us said that the cocktail menu was correct but the beer menu was incorrect but the beer menu on our dinner menus was correct. However, my menu was misprinted completely so you couldn't tell what the first column of beer was. 

The waiter was great; he was on top of all the errors and things left off the menu down to the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors in the menu. My friend and I split the nachos, beer cheese fries, and corn dip. 100% order the corn deep. It was excellent and a great portion for two. Not too cheesy and lots of flavor. The nachos are huge. Lots of roasted corn, chicken, and other toppings. Take a pass on the beer cheese fries. They were slightly cold and the cheese tastes off. The bacon was under coated. We ate the fries who did not have any toppings on them and they were fine. 

I love to see what's new in East Liberty and I'm really glad to see the space being utilized. I think there are a lot of things that still need worked out. The beer menu, service, and decor is awesome. Probably not suitable for large parties over four people. I'd love to go back and give it another shot and update the rating."}
{"text":"I drive by Fire Side every day for work and for some reason it has taken me so long to actually stop in! Now that I finally did, I am so glad! My average star review is simply based on high prices and mediocre service, but the food was excellent. I will also say that I was disappointed in happy hour options but my beer was good and my wings and fries were better. I got a honey mustard sauce on my wings which was unique and delicious and the Parmesan truffle fries with a garlic aioli that WILL have a positive impact on your life. Go check out their awesome menu!"}
{"text":"They have a huge awesome grill right in the middle of the place.  I got the mussels, they were great. My friend got onion rings with beer cheese. GET THE BEER CHEESE, Yum!  We got burgers, they were better than expected. Good beef.  The place was 4 to 5 stars, I did not give it 5 stars is because the waitress was terrible! She was shabbily dressed with holes in her stockings and seemed less than aware of her surroundings."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was impeccable. I would advise you to venture to said establishment. My friend said that the sangria was to die for (not really, but...) It is nice there"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner yesterday around 5:45. We were seated immediately at a low table. We had our daughter with us so I was glad to see they had highchairs and kids activities with crayons. 
We went at happy hour so all local beers with a keystone symbol were $4. We started off with perogie appetizer. It was really garlicky but good. I got the crab cake sandwich with green beans and my husband got the turkey burger with fries. He said it was the best turkey burger he had ever eaten. My crab cake was really good. No complaints on our food. 
I loved how the place was all windows and it was a really sunny day so it made it really nice inside and you would never know it was 30 degrees outside. 
My only complaint is that they don't have a changing table in the bathroom. They did have a small circular table though that we made do. 
I'm really surprised that every time we drive by it looks pretty empty. This place met all of our needs so we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have now been to Fire Side 4 times.  I can say that the staff is great here.  The servers are attentive, the bartenders are excited to mix interesting drinks, the chefs worked in symphony (I sat at the bar in front of the fire pit once). They seem to enjoy their work, and seem to care.  I have to say that if you stick to the deep fried items and the burgers, your meal is probably really good. My husband's food was fine (burgers) as were the fried appetizers we ordered. 
But if you order the other things - they are really missing the mark. They are not thought out.
I had the pear salad.  It had way too much pear, a chuck of brie, and 2 tiny, tiny pieces of lettuce. This was not a salad - it is more like a poached pear with cheese dish - period.  $15 was absurd and - make it into a salad!
I had the bibb lettuce and chicken salad.  By contrast, it was a whole head of bibb lettuce, at least a cup of dried cheeries, and grilled chicken.  Not another thing on it!  Add a tomato, or cucumbers, or avocado - or all 3.  There was a lot of chicken, but again - boring.
And then there was the shrimp and grits.  The grits were dark brown, and there was enough to feed a family of 6.  The shrimp were fine.  But there was so much (orange) liquid fat - 1/2 inch wide and 1/4 inch deep, around the bowl - it looked like a moat circling the grits. Serve a cup of grits (that aren't so full of fat and the grease not separated, the 3-4 shrimp, and call it a day."}
{"text":"Dump cake is must desert! Flatbreads are awesome. BBGW (Blackberry BBQ Grilled Wing) is my new favorite!  Good service and great atmosphere.  I'm coming back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Love this place! Extensive beer selection at a range of reasonable and splurge prices and the food is delightful! Sat at the bar every time I've been here and noticed the cleanliness of the chefs. Saw a chef drop a knife and walk it directly back to the dishwasher. Can't wait to come back again! PS: nachos and burgers are wonderful"}
{"text":"First of all, the beer list is awesome. I'd drink here anytime. The food, however, is a different story. Both times we've been here, everything was drowning in sauce. Though they're clearly trying the be hip like their East End neighbors, the ingredients don't seem very fresh, the presentation is poor, and the combinations of flavors are just not appetizing. I really hope they're able to turn this place around. So much potential, nice ambience, and good service. Just not quite there yet."}
{"text":"My mouth craved some new grub so I turned to Yelp to seek out the new hot spots in town. This place fell on my radar and it was on. 

Whoaaaa Nelly!!! This is not what I expected!!! I remember this place as a hotdog joint but boy has it changed! There's a beautiful wood fired oven with a nice lacquer top bar and sexy high top tables in there. The service was welcoming as well which made for an enjoyable evening. 

The menu made me want to try a few different things but some discipline kicked in and I went for a burger. While we waited for our food, the drinks came. I was in love at first sip. Omg...I wondered what had hit my tongue? Whatever it was took my taste buds on a journey which hit all of my senses and captured the rhythm of my stroke. Oh, wait...I'm sorry. I can't divulge everything this drink did to me. You gotta order it for yourself. Lol (it's the lemon one)

Next. 

My burger (black n gold or yellow) came with the sweet smoky bacon, caramelized onions with a generous slice of gouda that made my mouth sing. I actually stared at the burger for a moment. I almost sighed out loud which is something that I try not to do since it can be misinterpreted. The fries were good...they could've been a little warmer for my liking but truly not a major detractor to this meal. The chipotle ketchup was yum. 

So, I guess you could say I love this place. Is the food reasonably priced? Yes. Are the drinks expensive? Yes...but do you want to have an experience? Just do it. Well worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Nice place to hangout grab a drink and have some good wood fired food. Good selection of beer and whiskey. Try the mushroom Flatbread, wings,  or great burgers."}
{"text":"nice spot for some drinks with friends. long tap list for beers. pretty diverse menu. Smells good like smoking wood. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"I was torn between 3 and 4 stars. I would give it a 3.5, First huge plus, as others have mentioned, is the free parking. The vibe is also really cool, with big windows, high ceilings inside and cool decor. Also seems like they will have nice outside seating once it gets warmer. 

We were immediately told by our server that the very giant beer list hanging over the bar was \"probably out of date\" and to look at the printout instead. OK, but maybe someone should feel a tiny bit compelled to update the giant sign. Good beer selection but small servings at regular serving prices and regular servings overpriced by a dollar or two, not terrible but worth mentioning for those reading a review. 

We started with the nachos. Let me say I am totally biased against nachos. I think they are one of the worst appetizer choices at restaurants because they always just seem like shitty chips with sparse toppings. These ones were pretty good, with generous toppings including pulled chicken, but they still haven't swayed me into ordering nachos more often. 

Two of us had burgers and two had the ribs, which were on special. Ribs were the way to go here. Even thought it was a half rack, the serving was totally gigantic and even the human garbage disposal was unable to finish. The burgers were good (one queso and one black and gold) -- the burger itself was cooked medium as requested and had a good flavor -- but they were nothing to blow my mind. The fries were more thick cut with coarse sea salt which was tasty. Good portion for the fries too. Looked like a small serving but kept me from overdoing it.  

I would come back if someone invited me, but primarily for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a Monday night happy hour with some coworkers recently. The draft list is pretty darn good, and though I can't personally speak for the food, my buddies enjoyed their wings (maple bacon sriracha = yum). It wasn't too crowded, and the ambiance was lovely. We sat at the bar with the fires going and being able to watch the kitchen as we enjoyed our drinks and food. Would come back for a low-key happy hour or weeknight dinner soon!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I decided to have a night out and we wanted to try something new.  She has been eyeing up this place for weeks!  So we agreed to go.  It has a great vibe.  The ambiance was real chill.  However, I wish there had been some music playing.  If there was, it was too low to even hear.  

I got the garlic parm wings as an appetizer and they were delicious.  Perfectly cooked and crispy on the outside.  Then our entrees came.  I got the shrimp and grits.  Delicious!  I would definitely get it again.  My friend got the siracha bacon wings and some of them were a little under done.  Not exactly raw, but under cooked enough for her to set a couple of them aside without eating through the center.  She also got the beer cheese and bacon fries.  They were cold.  And SMOTHERED in the beer cheese sauce, which was so rich that she couldn't even eat them.  She sent them back and they were removed from her bill.  

We both agreed that we would definitely go back, but we would probably try something different.  I'm a firm believer in giving restaurants more than one shot.  Some nights they're just off their game.  My food was delicious, her food was just okay.  Therefore, this time around, Fire Side Public House gets 3 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner and was told that there was a separate seating area for large groups. This ended up being one long table on the side of the bar and 2 other separate tables behind it, so the two groups were separated. 

It took us about 30 minutes to put a drink order in and another 45 minutes to order our food. I ordered a black bean burger that was supposed to come with avocado. The server set down my food and said \"sorry for the avocados, the whole shipment came like that.\" The slices were hard as a rock, so I'm not sure why this wasn't mentioned before the food was brought out. The burger was very dry and had one slice of tomato and a sliver of an onion on it. 

Overall was very unimpressed with the service and food, but my cocktail was decent."}
{"text":"When looking for a lunch spot in or near the Shadyside area, The Fire Side Public House came to mind.  I've wanted to give it a try since it opened because I heard good things.  I was worried that it might be busy after reading a few other reviews, but the place was pretty empty when I met my brother on a Tuesday afternoon.

While waiting at the bar, I ordered the Bacon and Crab Hush Puppies.  I was informed shortly after placing my order that they were out of the Cajun Mousse they are typically served on.  I was fine with that, and the cook offered to give me a few of their sauces to try instead.  The hush puppies were good, nice and crunchy on the outside but lukewarm in the center.  I thought they could have been hotter.  I did like trying the different sauces and the Siracha aioli was my favorite with the hush puppies.  The cook said that was his favorite, too, when he inquired about my feelings regarding the sauces.  Once my brother arrived, we ordered up a couple burgers.  My brother went with the Breakfast Burger, I went with the Fire Side.  The burger itself (grass-fed beef) was the highlight for me though it was a bit overcooked (I ordered medium but there was no pink in the middle).  Unfortunately the bun was not sturdy enough to support said burger and fell apart before I was done.

There's definitely that wood-fired smell, but, well, it's in the name so you shouldn't be surprised.  Knowing this is their cooking method should also explain the wait.  They do have their own parking lot which is a plus.  Though this was my first visit, I should mention their menu does change.  I'm not sure how frequently, but they previously offered a shrimp and grits plate that is no longer available.  A couple seated next to me left when they discovered this.

I have mixed feelings.  The draft list is above average.  The food is okay.  The service is great.  (Our server didn't charge me for a beer because they were out of the mousse for the hush puppies.)  I liked Fire Side Public House but there were too many hiccups for it to be my first choice next time I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal here.  They have a fabulous list of beers on draft, and the majority are locally made. 

The food was prepared well, but we were hoping for more vegetarian options.  The grilled corn dip was excellent, and unexpectedly (but delightfully) spicy.

We both had the Black Bean Burger. The avocado, baby spinach and other toppings were delicious, but both of us were not wild about the burger.

The service was excellent! Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I just wanted to write a quick update regarding my last visit since this place isn't so new anymore. I took my boyfriend here for a few drinks on a whim after a quick trip to Target, since the Thai takeout we'd placed an order for was going to take about half an hour longer than we had originally expected. The atmosphere is still really nice and cozy, and the smoke smell isn't too overpowering. I like being close to the grill, because it means you can see and smell the amazing bacon being cooked. This really is a craft beer lover's dream with forty different brews on tap and reasonably priced 8oz and 16oz pours. We received attentive and excellent service, and the bartender did a wonderful job recommending some interesting IPAs for us to try. Good service carries more weight with me if my party is only having a few drinks, and my latest experience here means I'll definitely be back soon for another meal and some more beer."}
{"text":"My SO and his dad were looking for somewhere good to eat for dinner. We decided to check out this spot. It was a Sunday evening around 4:00 pm and it wasn't too crowded here. What I love the most about this place is the windows- it's completely open, making it so bright and beautiful inside. The service was great. We were able to choose our own seats and opted for some that were out of the direct sunlight. I wasn't super hungry, so I just went with an order of fries with a house salad. My SO got a burger and his dad had a chicken salad. All of our food was fresh and really tasty. I loved the blueberry vinaigrette dressing.The fries were super tasty as well. I had the fries with their blackberry bbq sauce, which was unique and tasty. Overall- we had a great time and I am looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"This location is so hidden, but I'm glad I found it! The bacon honey wings are really good, and happened to be on special (50c) when I dropped by. The beer menu is expensive and had a good selection of sour beers and porters/stouts, which I enjoyed. Good ambiance, although it is a bit smokey from the grill. I'll def be back for more happy hour/ daily specials!"}
{"text":"First time here didnt look to busy from the outside but once you go inside and smell the firewood it smells amazing inside.  
Great beer selection I went with the pizburgher which was amazing.   Also split an order of the siracha maple bacon wings which were also amazing as well.  Overall great place definitely would go back to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"So after going a whole semester of being poor and eating at home, I was super excited to finally try out a new restaurant again. The Fire Side Public House, a tucked away spot behind the East Liberty Target which opened a few weeks ago, and a spot I could not wait to get my hands on it.

My friend J and I went on Monday evening before he takes off to South America for the holidays. Even before you enter the location, you get a bright invitation illuminating from its door, being covered in blue/white holiday lights around the roof and windows. I'm not sure if this is seasonally intended or just for sake of brightness, but either way I was happy to see it lit up.

Inside, your eye is immediately guided to the center of the restaurant, taken up by the large vent with Fire Side Public House proudly displaying over the wood fire island cooking station. From side view, along the length of the restaurant it's set up as follows: Left [front] is the large board of beers and cocktails, middle [under the vent] are the open prep, cooking/grilling and plating stations where you get a grand view of your food being charred and assembled, while you take in the intoxicating smells of the burgers and the skillets. On the right [back] there are a few tables for parties larger than two. The entire cooking island is ringed by bar space, always my favorite place to sit. Above you, there is breathtaking art of our favorite Steel City from various angles and in various sizes. It's easy to miss until you follow up the vent and see where it leads. I much like that they are able to use the otherwise neglected ceiling and altogether it leaves you with a comforting feeling of sitting around a big fireplace.

The beer list is sizable for this small space with local, regional and national microbrews on tap and in the bottle. On the other side of the drink menu you get a whole listing of seasonal specialty cocktails. Naturally right now they are holiday styled. I was really tempted to get the \"Santa, I know him!\" just for the name but I was trying to constrain myself as it was Monday. The menu is sleek and simple, but considering that I had prime view of everything that was being served, my mouth watered at everything. J and I had a skillet each, mine the Chicken Pasta, his the Blue corn shrimp and grits. Each looked great. The chicken sausage was hearty and the pasta done just right. Two mentions: The consistency was a little bit off for me, the basil infused cream was a bit on the milky side, having the effect of \"washing\" the pasta, rather than coating it as a sauce should. Also, it came off too delicate. The basil flavoring a bit lost and it definitely needed salt. I'm sure they skimped on the salt in favor of the basil and the sausage, but as none of the ingredients bonded together [not even with the help of the grated fontina cheese], I was definitely missing a bite. 

The blue corn shrimp on the other hand looked awesome, and I was experiencing food-envy. It was served with three massive prawns and the grits were served good and hearty. I will be checking that out for next time. I hear it was good, despite him attempting to ruin it by drenching his food in hot sauce. [Sigh, that man cannot eat any food without hot sauce]

Lastly, it is very well priced for the quality and portion of food that you get. I'm happy to have walked away with a full but not overloaded feeling as even a carby pasta dish came off light even with a beverage you should be under the $20 dollar mark which is refreshing for the location and the fact that pittsburgh's more recent places are getting out of hand. [see other reviews]

All in all I am very pleased with my experience at FSPH, especially as it's close to my new home. I will definitely be coming back to try everything else on this menu and hopefully still before the the \"Santa, I know him!\" disappears from the menu."}
{"text":"New food spot in town. Visiting my Pittsburgh friend and my friend Ashley introduced us to this place. Apparently this place is owned by the same people who own Sidelines (thee best wing place in PGH hands down)! So we absolutely love Sidelines and wanted to try this new place. The menu changes and right now they are still trying new things out. My black and yellow burger was great! Grass fed beef (always a plus) smoked Gouda Apple bacon, onions on a brioche roll (best rolls for burgers in my opinion). I didn't care for the fries too much. And I had a drink I don't remember what it was  maybe \"we should be best friends\". My friends had a breakfast burger, wings, the Arancini (risotto siraccha balls) were really good too. My friends had the makers mark/ ginger ale drinks and I took a sip very weak as far as makers mark taste. I'd come back to this place. I'd be interested to see how the menu changes."}
{"text":"I first found Fire Side Public House on yelp, actually. I stopped in on a Friday at about 630 with my fiancé and we found two seats at the bar right in front of the fire the cooks use that's centered in the middle of the bar. I say bar instead of restaurant because the place is mainly a giant bar with the cooks working in an open flame in the middle, with small tables on the outer parameter around the bar. Anyway, we caught the end of happy hour so we got our beers for a nice discount, and there was a really nice selection as well. The tacos were sold out so we couldn't get those. We decided to split an app and burger and they were both delicious. Bold flavors, perfectly cooked. We're definitely going back for taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Cool place.  Great beers on tap (at least 40), interesting cocktails, great service.  We had the Sriracha maple bacon wings and the lettuce wraps.  The wings were really good, a bit overdone, almost like jerky, but that sauce was so good it made up for it.  They cook over a wood fire grill and it's a great atmosphere.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Very nice staff. Food was absolutely delicious. Hard to decide what to eat, everything on the menu sounded great. They also have grilled wings!"}
{"text":"Went here for quick meal with the family. They have kids macaroni and grilled cheese, which I didn't see on the menu, but they were happy to make. Draft list is great and I appreciated the PA designation on the chalkboard (other places, please stop making the waitress run through the list!). Monday night is Yuengling and Wing night, Yuengling is ... yuengling, wings - BBQ and Hot - were nice and juicy, not too saucy, probably less spicy than what some people want. Main portions are \"Pittsburgh\" sized, which means the Yinzer salad is for 2 people and the sausage was enough on its own. 

Wasn't smoky - the range hood does a good job keeping the smoke down, although the door was open, so maybe this would change in winter. The only downside to this place (and anything north of the busway) is how disconnected it feels from the rest of Shadyside/E Liberty . But yeah, if like everyone else you drive everywhere, plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I'm glad that this building didn't stay empty once Station Street Hotdogs vacated, but I will say I was a tad underwhelmed. My friend and I shared an order of crab hush puppies that were ok.  Nothing to write home about, but the aioli sauce served with it was good.
For dinner I had a bourbon glazed chicken sandwich that was decent.  I'd order it again.  
They have a ton of beers listed on their chalkboard but many aren't available.  That's ok, the selection is still admirable and you can certainly find something to fit the bill.
It is very dark inside and gives you the impression of a place you'd go on a date, not with a group of friends.  You can sit at the counter or at high tops that surround the perimeter.  The grill is in plain view in the middle of the room so you can watch the chef cooking.
I think I need to come back again, they definitely deserve a second look from me."}
{"text":"Every so often your mind wonders if what use to be has been filled in yet.  Also you think to yourself is it going to be any good or even better than the last establishment that filled a space.  That's what I was thinking when I stumbled upon (or re-stumbled upon this space) Fire Side Public House.  After running errands and needing a quick bite to eat, I found myself here, happy.

Walking in here everything feels familiar.  There is that familiar diner feel with the countertop and laid back atmosphere.  Walk in, find yourself a spot and take in the aromas of the food that you have a front row seat to see prepared for you.  Warmer months allow for outdoor seating if that is your thing.  

I found myself quickly looking over the menu and finding it hard to decide on exactly what I needed to satiate myself with.  Deciding shortly thereafter that everything looked amazing I made a decision to have a small bite to eat here and then take a meal with me to eat later during my lunch break at work.  While I waited for my meal to go I decided to try the pierogies.  A generous portion of potato filled pasta that are grilled, then served with caramelized onions, fresh green onions and a horseradish aioli.  I love pierogies, but what put these over the top for me was the aioli.  That spiciness that was afforded to allow my palette to enjoy all the flavors of the plate was everything and then some.  If I'm honest, I wanted to ask to take some of that aioli home with me, I almost licked my plate that's how good it is.  The service here is top notch, servers are always smiling and the chefs are really on top of things in the kitchen, they are masters of that wood fire grill.

For my meal to go I decided to give the Queso Burger a try.  Anytime that you fuse some Mexican flavor with a burger I am down to try it.  Especially when you got queso fresco, cilantro lime salsa and sriracha aioli on a wood fired grilled burger patty, mouth watering.  Adding the coolness of the avocado clicks with this burger.  I definitely had my fill of good food that day.  You never have to sell me when the side is fresh cut fries.

So was this place even better than the last establishment?  Well, you have to ask yourself: are you a hamburger person or a hot dog person?  That's what it comes down to for this location.  I'm pretty partial to hot dogs, but because of the hamburger I had that day, this is definitely a great reuse of space, but better, I don't know...I like my burgers and dogs equally."}
{"text":"The wings were cooked well. I asked how spicy the dry seasoning was, \"I wouldn't call it spicy\" is what they said. It was very very spicy and mostly salt. The Sriracha maple wings were on point. The mac and cheese though, was the worst I've ever had. I rarely complain (which I didnt). I just didn't eat it. It was cold wet noodles with greasy \"gouda\" cheese covered in delicious bacon. I use gouda very regularly at home. I make Mac and cheese like 49 times a year, this was very disappointing. I liked the atmosphere and the help was cool,but it was weird like they acted like nothing was wrong when I said it was no good,like grease water on noodles. I paid and left. 
Lemonade was nice though"}
{"text":"Visited tonight for a family night out.  Great choice of craft beers.  Look at all those taps.  To our surprise it was happy hour so the prices were amazing.  Both sons had the ribs and loved them.  The grilled green beans that came with the ribs were so good and very different  Good appetizers too. Very friendly staff.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good mix drinks good draft beer selection peanut butter burger was good.shroom burger was not very shroomy  (3 mushrooms) but other then the lack of mushrooms it's was good."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon with my boyfriend and sat at the bar. We had a friendly and helpful server. The draft selection was excellent. We stared with the crab hush puppies, they were crispy and flavorful. I had the grilled romaine salad and the street corn. The salad was good, but I highly recommend the street corn, it was great. My boyfriend had a huge BLT and fries with gravy and poutine. We would definitely come here again. Bring a sweater, all the windows make the dining space chilly."}
{"text":"Food was good, beer selection was good, service was good!  Really only positives aside from the location and actual building.  
We had a Groupon so we figured we'd try a new place.  Everyone there was super friendly and everything was great."}
{"text":"Nice selection of mostly PA brewed beers. Most of which are 16oz and in the $5.00 range (8oz pours for half that).

Food is very good. There are unique burger choices such as the queso burger and the Quebec burger. Every one I have had is excellent. The nachos are fantastic.

The staff is very friendly. Definitely has a neighborhood feel to it. 

Real good happy hour, too!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see that other reviews are positive, as I did not have a good experience here.  The place was very loud - it wasn't very crowded and I still had a hard time hearing what people at my table were saying (music was also too loud and not very good).  I got what I thought was a portabello salad, but was literally just a couple of slices of tomato and portabello on a plate with a pile of pistachios in the middle, which was not very good and cost $13 (more than one of the burgers).  My friends all had burgers that were cold and described as \"ok\".  The beer also seemed to be overpriced ($4.75 for an 8 oz glass).  On the plus side, I had a good beer that I'd never seen before and the space itself is very interesting.  Probably won't be going back here except maybe for a drink."}
{"text":"totally solid place for beers and burgers. the fact that they have a parking lot is awesome, but the most important point was that the food was great. just really good, straight-forward burgers, made with quality ingredients. Friendly staff too. Was empty for lunch when we went - more people need to come here."}
{"text":"This was an excellent change of pace. We ordered the \"small\" bites nachos that were huge and delicious!!! I also had the Fireside Burger. I also recommend trying anyone of the many craft beers. Our server Tiffany have wonderful service and made excellent suggestions. Cannot wit to go back and try the wings"}
{"text":"The grilled corn dip alone is worth the trip.  I'd planned to have an entire meal, but after asking for more chips to scrape every ounce of dip out of the bowl, I was pretty full.  B tells me that his burger was excellent."}
{"text":"This place can be VERY good at times & just terrible at other times. He first time I ever came here which was a few months ago the food was amazing. My friend and I dined in. I got a burger and it was probably one of the best burgers I've had. I've went back a few times since & ordered take out and the food kept progressively getting worse and worse. The last time I came here I got a burger for take out. It was absolutely terrible. The burger was dry, it had nothing on it but a little bit of cheese and a very disappointing portion of fries (literally 15 fries total). I was already home so I didn't even bother going back. After that experience I definitely don't plan on going back. To be completely fair, I ordered the burger about an hour before they were about to close so that may have been a factor but still, that is not acceptable. I was very disappointed considering the price of the burger. 

All in all, food varies. It can be really good one time and average another. If you do eat here, I would try to avoid take out!!"}
{"text":"Chefs are awesome--burgers are well seasoned and hearty. Service is great as well. I will frequent this place a lot going forward."}
{"text":"Decent at best. Service was very spotty and they don't have a designated host or hostess which is odd. Having said that, the beer list is good and has a lot of local options and other good national breweries are well represented. The food left a lot to be desired however. Several other tables around us sent food back. If we ever go back it will just be for drinks. Much better options in the area. I hope they improve because they have potential."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Fire Side and it didn't disappoint. The staff was very welcoming and attentive. Loved the relaxed atmosphere, some place nice to go to after a long day at work. Plus, it was $5 Wine Wednesday, so I enjoyed a couple of glasses. I had the Breakfast Burger and it was delicious. I do not eat pork so it was a little tough picking something on the menu that didn't have it, so I just held the bacon. It was still enjoyable though! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you haven't found the Fire Side you need to place it high on your to do list. We've always had nothing but tasty food here. Their wings are tops, with our most favorite being the sriracha, bacon and Maple syrup. We had the crab cake hush puppies this evening, yummy! The drink list is broad, just have some fun trying a new drink or two, they always have a special. The other great thing about this place if that it's in East Liberty, off the circle, behind Target, and there is ample parking all the time. And, you can sit outside as much as in."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch here today. Ordered half a rack of ribs and got more ribs than I could eat in a single sitting. Flavorful, with the delightful blackberry glaze. Also on the table were crab cake sandwich and flatbread, both of which were very satisfying. Very long beer list, and 8 oz pour available if you just want to taste one (or many)."}
{"text":"The food was good, beer was cheap, but it wasn't enough to make me ever go back. The place is extremely smokey and the crowd was off putting. 

A group of men beside me kept dropping the n-word and made they made the experience super uncomfortable. (Not the restaurants fault though)

The service was good and the employees were friendly, but again my eyes were watering from the smoke and I feel like I need to shower to get the smell off of me. 

The place is really cool inside though and the decor and layout is suiting.  If you are looking for a loud bar with a bonfire feel then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Drinks only review.  

We stopped in just after lunch for a drink and ended up staying for 3.  They have a ton of beers and offer half pints so you can try a bunch.  Prices range from $2.50- $7.  

They also had a great cocktail list all names after A league of their own quotes and they were fantastic.  What's not to love?!?  

We will be back for grilled mussels, a black bean burger and some crab hush puppies!"}
{"text":"Dude! This place is awesome! It's a lot cooler than your average burger joints around town. The food and beer selection is on point! It took me awhile to come out here, so don't make that same mistake. Come out and support this place! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We stopped by last weekend and each got a chicken wing dish (my husband got the maple, and I got the garlic parmesan) and shared an order of fries. The fries were delicious, and the wings were good -- when they weren't overcooked. I couldn't even eat one of mine; it was thoroughly burned. I was happy to see Arsenal cider on tap.

The building totally reminds me of an old Howard Johnsons or Perkins. The windows all around are great, but I was freezing the whole time. Too bad the fire side wasn't closer! While I love the fire smell, I didn't like that it lingered on us long after we left.

The staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"We stoped in for lunch the day after Christmas. The fellow behind the bar was polite, helpful and knowledgeable about the different brews on tap. After some discussion he recommended the Morgantown for me and he was spot on, it was great.

The kitchen area is in the center of thd bar, the other 2 workers never stoped. It is real wood fire and one guy seemed to be doing prep work and cooking while the other tended to keeping the fire just right (please get the poor guy the ove glove for god sakes) 

The food was delicious although a bit pricey especially for a pub setting but that's the problem I don't think they know what they're trying to be. 

It's actually quite sad this could be a really great  place with just a few minor changes for example: the glass on the exterior should be thoroughly cleaned, Decor should be a little bit more warm and inviting and building some type of Cabinetry around the center kitchen area wouldn't be a bad idea either nobody wants to see a gross looking floor drain in the center of the kitchen while they're eating or dingy metal shelving.  They have all the Necessities for having a great place; good staff, good food and good beer, a few tweaks and this would be our new favorite place. Oh and as we sat there watching the poor bartender have to walk a marathon every time he needed to tend to someone near the front door, I couldn't help but think some type of pass through or walkthrough for them on that side of the bar would be beneficial."}
{"text":"Really glad I checked this place out!! I don't usually write reviews but this place deserved one. It's conveniently located behind Target in East Liberty with it's own parking lot which was nice. I went on a Thursday night with friend. It wasn't crowded, and one of the staff members inside actually saw us coming in and met us at the door and held the door open for us.  We decided to sit at the bar. The bartenders were very attentive and they had a huge selection of drafts, and the bartender had good recommendedations and let us know about the happy hour special, which was a 16oz draft for $6. Not bad at all! 
We ordered food as well as drinks....I got the queso burger (came with fries) and my friend had the buffalo chicken flat bread. Both entrees were absolutely delicious! Nice portion sizes too. Overall great food, great beer selection, and excellent service! Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"My husband has been trying to get me to go here for the past 3 months and we finally got the chance to check it out last week. The location is a little bit off the beaten path but right next to Zeke's drive through made it very easy to find. Inside it's sort of an open concept with a grill/bar combo in the middle of the restaurant. Good draft list for beers and they serve an 8oz beer portion which may be just right for lunch. Some TVs could help this place be considered for local sporting events. 
Regarding the food, we got some grilled cajun wings as an appetizer and these were the best part of the meal. Smoky flavor and good seasoning really added to these well cooked wings. My husband has been wanting to try a burger from here so he ordered the fireside (basic) burger and wanted it cooked medium. We've been to many places where it's been overdone so we were very hopeful. I got the wedge salad. The portions are a good size and the presentation is interesting (his burger came on a giant cutting board with really no sides to catch drips from the burger). However in this case the burger was actually undercooked and was actually on the rare side (cold inside). He was too much of a wimp to bother the waitress and send it back but it's always easier to cook more than to refire an overcooked burger. The fries were good!
 My wedge salad was a little awkward as all the items came separate from the wedge of lettuce that the majority of these types of salads have already cut up and sprinkled on top of the lettuce. The items that came with it sounded good (tomato, avocado, egg) but they were all just basically halved and put on the plate next to the lettuce. The flavor was good but the bleu cheese dressing was not very good that I ordered in place of the ranch dressing it came with. 
I am also giving this 3 stars because our table was wobbly and we had to fix it with a napkin and we looked over and another table had a tattered napkin underneath of one of the legs suggesting that these tables need some maintenance. Overall I would come back for happy hour and eat more apps/wings but would not come back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"A great, casual joint in East Liberty! The food was good, and all PA beers were $4 during happy hour. Plus they had half-off small plates (fries, bread, side salad etc.) They have specials most nights other than their happy hour, too.

They have a parking lot which is a huge plus. Came on a Friday night and got seated right away. They take reservations online through Open Table. 

I'd definitely be back for both food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I've passed this place a few times and it always looks inviting. Decided to give it a try last night and was definitely pleased! Our server, Jesse, was just perfect. The atmosphere was great. Other reviewers noted an overwhelming smokey smell, but I didn't note that. 

The beer options were great. A lot of beers that I haven't seen in other places in the city. As for food, highly suggest the crab and bacon hushpuppies. I went on taco Tuesday, so I ordered three: fish, steak and black bean. The steak was a little too overdone and chewy, my only complaint. The toppings on the tacos were fantastic. My partner had a pierogi kielbasa sandwich situation, which he enjoyed. 

As another note, I used the restroom -- very clean, but one suggestion. There's two single restrooms right next to one another. It would be nice to see them both labeled for all genders."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great atmosphere.  Friendly, knowledgeable bartenders who know their whiskey and their beer.  Lots of microbrews.  They have a wood fire grill that adds an extra taste to the food you can't really get anyplace else.  I highly recommend The Fire Side Public House."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices during happy hour. However the service was mismanaged across the board. People getting food out of order after long wait times. Low on wait staff. The people were nice and helpful but two people can only do so much with such a small grill. High potential, but not enough kitchen space or waiting staff. Maybe try during off hours!"}
{"text":"We have driven by here several times, & decided to stop on the recommendation of my personal trainer. They support local businesses for all of their ingredients.  The food is excellent, & large portions for taking home left overs for a second meal.  The ribs were fantastic, & my husband had a burger that he declared was very good. We had 3 different \"sides\" between us, & all 3 were good. The drinks are delicious, & our bartender/server, Lisa, should get a raise. She's good.  This place certainly warrants a return visit.."}
{"text":"I've been to Fire Side a number of times now and have had a good experience each time.  The service and food are always good.  The first time I had anything from them was when they donated some wings to a grand opening party at Painting with a Twist in East Liberty.  The flavors were unique and delicious (sriracha maple bacon and blackberry bbq).

The menu pulls from lots of local sources, including Dave & Andy's ice cream.  Super yummy vanilla ice cream for dessert!  It's always cool to get a full-on Pittsburgh vibe when you're at a restaurant.

Due to dietary restrictions (gluten-free), I am limited to certain menu items.  The manager, Sean, was very hospitable and brought me a tray of gluten-free sauces to try for my grilled wings.  He was knowledgeable and helpful, and really added to my already-good opinion of the restaurant.  

Five stars would be if there were more food options for people with dietary restrictions -- keeping separate fryers for allergens, etc., so I could try more foods on the menu to review -- but otherwise, a solid four stars."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks to check it out and we were not disappointed. The 40 tap Draft list is awesome and the 8oz pour option makes it easy to try a lot of different ones. The cocktail menu had a lot of classics with their own twists. All of the food looked and smelled great, I can't wait to go back to try it out sometime. The only downside is you smell like a camp fire after because of the wood grill."}
{"text":"Perhaps not fair to write a review while still in burger/beer euphoria. Then again, if you can't tell her how you feel after making love, you may never do it. 

First: Beer list includes a wide variety of domestic crafts from locals to PA through Michigan, and even a Rogue Chipotle. 

Second: One of the best burgers I have had in a while. Patty was juicy, and flavorful. Grilled onions were nicely caramelized caramelized and melted in your mouth. The bacon had crispy edges but was a soft (not the overcooked sawdust style one often finds). The bun was soft and delicious. The Pixburger is quite good. 

Third: Freakin Fabulous Fries that are well worthy of alliteration. Where there enough to fill me? Yes. Do I wish there were more because of the fresh cut perfectly cooked goodness? Yes.

I cant address the complaints of others, but on a Wednesday night, the service, food, beer, and space were perfect. 

I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went for a late Sunday lunch on Father's Day. Everything was so fresh and well prepared. The draft list seems endless and the service was wonderful. We will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service was great, but food was sub par.

We got the dip, the crab hushpuppies, a burger, and the shrimp and grits.
The dip was wonderful and spicy
The overwhelming amount of sauce that came with the crab hush puppies was cold enough to crash the temp of the whole plate and turned it all lukewarm.
The burger was under seasoned, and simply average.
The grits were an absolute MESS. Shrimp was way overcooked and not deveined, grits were pulverized and had no texture or flavor to speak of, and the presentation was something more like skyline  hot dog chili than cheddar grits with a lovely sheen of grease floating on top.

Great place for a drink and a snack, but I'd eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was there on business and was referred by a friend of mine who told me I had to try it. We arrived about 20 minutes before they were going to close which is not uncommon for any restaurant. We were immediately greeted at the door and told they were closing so we needed to order right away. No Welcome to our restaurant or any type of cordial pleasantries. We set at the food bar which is a good portion of their seating. I ordered their street fair corn along with a  crab cake sandwich. The people behind the counter were nice but somewhat in a rush and seemed agitated. We received our food in a timely manner minus the corn which I never asked again because I figured they didn't want to cook it because it may take too long. The crab cake sandwich was excellent and highly recommend it. In my opinion, the overall experience was horrible. They should change their hours and close a half hour earlier but somehow they forgot they are  in the restaurant business. When I was a server many years ago we used to have customers come in 2 minutes before closing but the owner of the business was excited to have them in as they were paying customers and we're never rushed. What the rude person at the door didn't know was that I've been traveling 8 hours from Florida and was very hungry and waited to eat because this place was recommended. I would not go back ever."}
{"text":"This place is in an odd location, but I'm so glad they settled into East Liberty.

They have 40 taps of a wide variety of beer. The bartender is exceptionally knowledgable and will gladly pour a sample of anything you're curious about. 

The food is AMAZING. I love the wood-fired grilled wings and brie/pear grilled cheese. Their happy hour makes apps super affordable and easy to try all at once, if you so desire.

I'll admit i'm not a huge fan of smelling like a campfire when I leave (although I'm sure some people love that) but what really prompted the five-star rating was the attitude of the staff.

The second time I arrived on location, I got there a few minutes before 10pm. I thought they closed at 11pm but I guess they scaled back their hours. I was STARVING and when I found out they were about to close, I was ready and willing to pop out and find food elsewhere. I work in the service industry and didn't want to be \"that guy.\"

Both the bartender and chef insisted that I stay. They gave me genuine smiles and said that they were happy to feed me. I never felt pushed out. I never felt like an inconvenience. 

Bottom line: check this place out. It's a new gem to the area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible taste to each dish. Unique and intense flavors and all food is made over an open wood burning fire-not a greasy grill. It makes a difference with the flavors. They have a million craft beers on tap and I've never tasted a better pierogi dish in Pittsburgh. If you are a foodie you have to try this spot. It's our regular go to now...."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.5-4 star rating. Came here on a whim while yelping for a new lunch spot. The place is REALLY cool! Huge bar area and a wood grill right in the middle of it (I left smelling like grill but I was NOT mad). Going through the alcohol list they have tons of selections (beer and liquor), a lot of beer on draft. 

The service was great, super nice staff, warm hello and goodbye and had a very attentive server. My friend and I split the chicken nachos to start (YOU NEED THESE!) unbelievably good and it's not drenched in nacho cheese and stuff that makes you feel guilty for eating it. I got a salmon blt, it was so good but I could barely finish because of the nachos. The presentation was very cute, they have a kind of mismatched dining ware thing going. The portions were most definitely enough to fill you up. 

My only complaint would have to be the very small menu. Maybe a handful of each: appetizer, lunch/dinner/ and salads. Probably not best for the very picky eaters. But I think it's one of those small menu, but everything on it is perfected kinda thing. definitely recommend trying this place out"}
{"text":"I almost hate to say it, due to gift certificate-gate, but the food is really good. The BF had heard great things and he really wanted to go, and what my baby wants, my baby gets. So, we went. The first time we went for a snackish-lunch and just got a few apps to share. We had the pierogies, the crab hush puppies and French fries.
As a side note, I really think the worth of a restaurant can be measured by the deliciousness of their fries. Really? It's such a simple thing, but so hard to get right, never mind perfect! And when a restaurant serves frozen, pre-packaged junk sticks, I feel like they are saying outright \"Don't come here; we don't care.\" Anyway, I degress. 
The crab hush puppies were super. The pierogies were fried, which isn't my thing, but the BF liked them. And the fries....Vonderbar! We went again for an actual dinner last night. We started with an app- they have happy hour from 5-7 with $5 shareables- the crab hush puppies again. Then I ended up getting the chicken club sandwich, which was one of the best chicken sandwiches I can remember. It was cooked perfectly and the wood smoked flavor was unbelievable. It comes with thick cut bacon, on toasted bread with lettuce and tomato. I expected it to come on a bun, and was weary when I saw the bread, but it was perfect. Not to toasted that it cut your mouth, and held up to the sandwich pretty well. The BF had the sword fish, which is also not my thing, but he loved it. I mean, really loved it. Green beans and a wild rice kind of thing finished of his meal. He was really happy with it, although the rice was weird to me. It tasted like Uncle Ben's chicken rice or something. AND, the best part, the service was great. So I guess it's true, redemption is a dish best severed wood smoked!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Very local and friendly staff and the food was amazing!  A bit out of the way but so worth looking for this spot!  Support this local restaurant, it is awesome!"}
{"text":"Service was awful and the bartenders and servers seemed under trained and under staffed. Beer is far too expensive and though there were a lot of choices there wasn't much variety in style. Food was bland and came out undercooked even though it took forever. Oh and you'll smell like a campfire when you leave due to poor ventilation. There are a lot of great restaurants in East Liberty/Highland Park... Save yourself the trouble and pick anyone of them but Fire Side."}
{"text":"The ManBeast and I are currently sitting in the Fire Side Public House for the second dinner in 3 nights -- that's saying something, even for a couple who tends to get stuck on places we like (& then revisiting multiple times). So, why are we back?

THE PROS: The food is fantastic.

Correction: the BURGERS (the only food we have tried) are fantastic.  Cooked to order, quality meat (grass-fed beef, according to their menu), grilled to perfection on the open wood-fired grill that dominates the open-plan kitchen, lovingly sandwiched between brioche buns. 

The ManBeast has now ordered the eponymous Fire Side Burger for the second time. He said he couldn't imagine a better burger.

I had the Québec Burger on Friday and am currently (slightly...okay, more than a little) regretting not ordering it again. BUT I haven't yet tried the burger I've ordered tonight -- as a good scientist, I am experimenting with the Black & Yellow Burger. I expect it will taste as good...or better.

MORE PROS: Terrific draft menu. Beer lovers rejoice! The PA-brewed options are marked with a keystone on their chalkboard menu. Some terrible (read: standard) options BUT they are far outweighed by the quality offerings. A good blend of IPAs, stouts, and adventurous/different options, like the Anderson Valley Briny Mellon Gose.

Our Friday night server, Phil, was great. I thought he reminded me of my husband. More hilariously (for me), my husband thought he reminded him of my husband. When asked why, he only said, \"He doesn't know how to end conversations, like me.\"
(Phil, you do you.)

Setting and ambiance are pretty solid. In fashionable hipster style, your burger arrives on a plank, hand-cut fries in a metal basket. They're definitely vibing industrial-hipster chic, but in a way that's not off-putting or alienating, even to the most ardent yinzer bleeding black and yellow. TVs unobtrusively played the Pens games both times we've been here.

CONS: Next door to the World's Worst Post Office. 
(In other words, no real cons.)

Overall, get yourself to Fire Side. 
(And say hi to Phil.)"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place for happy hour on a Monday. We first went in to sit at the bar and the bartender abruptly said we had to sit at the very end of the bar since those stools were saved. What on earth? We then proceeded to go outside to sit on their patio since it was ice cold and no other seats at the bar were free for two. It took sometime for us to get waited on but our waitress was friendly and gave us her opinions of foods we inquired about. However, their happy hour drink specials were too confusing with some beers over this alcohol percentage were part of the special and others were not. It's an all or nothing....don't make it so confusing. We ordered wings as an appetizer and they were good...just the right amount of flavor and crispy. We did order them at 5:30 thinking it was happy hour. I had a steak salad and it was good; nothing mind blowing but good. My BF's steak burger was delicious. When we proceeded to get our bill we asked our server why our wings weren't part of the happy hour special price like the table next to us and she said, \"our happy hour is from 6-8 and you ordered them too early.\" We felt misinformed and slighted because when I went in to use the restroom there were no patrons at any of those \"reserved stools\" at the bar nearly an hour and a half later. Please up your customer service and make happy hour less confusing."}
{"text":"When the Station Street Hot Dog restaurant was located at 6290 Broad St in East Liberty, I visited the restaurant several times and I enjoyed their food.  The problem that I had with the restaurant is that the menu was very limited and to make a long drive for hot dog and fresh cut fries, although tasty, just wasn't worth it.  Additionally, paying $15 or so for said hot dog and fries just wasn't worth the effort.  Hey, I can go get a pack of high quality hot dogs and a couple of potatoes and feed a horde for the same price.  Would I have the same accoutrements?  Not necessarily, but close enough!

That leads me to the re-opening of the same space as The Fire Side Public House.  Now, my cousin told me that the new owners were having a \"soft opening\" and that I should get there quickly.  (I have been eyeballing the opening of this place for quite some time, so I hightailed it over there and I called my fellow Yelper Tim W. to let him in on the soft opening secret.)

The ambiance of the place is literally \"smoky hipster-chic\".  (They have a show kitchen centered around a Grillworks oven.   The owners also own Sidelines Beer House in Sewickley, which opened in 2012, and Sidelines Bar & Grille in Millvale, ) The menu includes sandwiches, burgers, small plates and entrees.  I have actually been to the restaurant/pub on two different occasions and they're barely open, so be a little patient with them.  On my first occasion, I had the grilled Siracha Maple Bacon wings and my daughter Muff had the Smoked Chicken Nachos as appetizers.  The wings were delicious and cooked perfectly.  My only complaint was that they actually came AFTER my entrée.  (That's a timing issue that the chefs have to work out.)  My daughter enjoyed her nachos and I thought that they were good, but I think that they can be GREAT if they truly \"smoke\" the chicken ahead of time and then heat it/sear it right before serving.

Now to the entrees!  I had the Blue Corn Shrimp & Grits and my daughter had the Beer Glazed Citrus Chicken.  I am a shrimp & grit connoisseur!  The Fire Side's shrimp & grit dish was tasty.  Wood-fired Cajun seasoned shrimp over blue corn grits with an over easy egg?  Shoooot!  Sign me up!  Minor complaint?  Yes!  I love almost any type of shrimp in any form or fashion, but peeling grilled head-on shrimp after they have been \"stuck\" in grits is not a pleasant experience.  Lose the shrimp \"body\" shell, keep the head on and grill away! (They have another shrimp dish that is prepared similarly, \"Smoked Prawns\",that is better served by this style of preparation because the diner is not asked to dip their hands into grits to enjoy the shrimp.)  Muff's Beer Glazed Citrus Chicken needed a dose of additional seasoning/sauce to enhance the dish.
The desserts that we had, Campfire S'Mores and Blueberry Cobbler served in cast iron pans were delicious.  The S'Mores dish needed a little more graham crackers and the chocolate needs to be placed on top of the crackers and not at the bottom of the pan. (Burned the chocolate in spots.)  Blueberry Cobbler?  Yummy!  They should change the cobbler seasonally.

On my second occasion, we had their signature Fire Side burger, Smoked Prawns, Beer Cheese & Bacon Fries and Chicken Skillet Pasta.  All of these dishes were decent and the service on both occasions was excellent.  I would definitely recommend trying this restaurant.

Was everything excellent?  No, but they are definitely heading in the right direction.  Once they tweak and refine a couple of the dishes, (E.g., The beer cheese sauce was way too thin) they will definitely be worthy of 5 stars, in my humble opinion.  They have all of the makings (I.e., Reasonable price points, tasty menu offerings, great service) of a five star pub, just give them a moment to get their bearings.  We need this type of place in the East End where you can leisurely enjoy tasty food and drinks without competing in expensive parking Olympics."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place after reading the reviews but the food is not good. 

There is a great atmosphere- it feels like a diner from the 50's. Also, the drinks are relatively cheap  and there is a very good selection of beers. Service was good for being as busy as it was. 

The real issue here is the food. I ordered the crab hush puppies which came out literally on a bed of the Cajun sauce. There was too much sauce, the hush puppies were overly salty and not good. I ended up not eating the entire plate. Also, they were delivered after my burger was sent out which was odd. 

The person I was with got Mac n cheese- not a hard thing to mess up. I tried a few bites. The cheese was completely flavorless. The bacon, chicken and scallions were not well integrated into the dish.

My Black and Gold burger was what reaffirmed that I won't be coming black. The burger itself was pretty flavorless. I ordered it rare and it came out well done. But worst of all there were supposed to be onions on the burger- but there were none on mine! The bacon was not good. And bacon is a hard thing to get wrong. The person I was with noted the same thing about their peanut butter and jelly burger. They said it was too sweet and the burger was flavorless. 

I think this is a good place to come for drinks- but I will not be coming back if I want food."}
{"text":"Great service with a smile.  Our waitress was great.

When you walk in you know that there is a wood fired grill, smells like my house when I have a fire in the fireplace.
 
My first thought on the menu was to have a burger and wings but then I noticed the Grilled Crab Cake go by on a plate..changed my mind.  The Crab sandwich had apple wood bacon, some romaine lettuce and a tasty sriracha aioli sauce was huge and very good.  A little sloppy to eat but very satisfying.  A side of thick fresh cut fries came with and were soft and tasty."}
{"text":"First time eating at Fire Side Public House. Wow. Probably one the best burger we've ever had.... and we are foodies!  Loved the wood fired grill, locally sourced grass fed beef and 40 beers on tap. Great casual atmosphere and service. Happy to have this gem right in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Why I forgot how good it is here is beyond me. Trying to find good brunch the day after st Patty's in Pittsburgh is a feat in itself. Trying to find amazing food for a great price is almost impossible. Yet Fire Side somehow checked all the boxes.

I attempted to tackle the biggest crab cake I've had in my life, and to my surprise I failed. Not only was the sandwich hot and fresh, but it was the size of a half pound burger, something you don't ever see in Pittsburgh. I highly recommend it and garlic aoli fries while you're at it. The service was fantastic and the sights and smells from the fire grill are amazing. 

Don't wait any longer. Get here now."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place because the menu looked great. However, most of the items we ordered had too much flavor. The garlic parm wings had too much garlic unless you absolutely love garlic. I don't, so I wasn't a fan. Wasn't a fan of the Korean BBQ wings either; I thought the flavor was a bit too strong for me. But do try the hush puppies! They were very tasty and were the best part of the meal. All of the different components of the hush puppies worked really well together. For my entree, I ordered the Quebec burger, which was very salty, so I barely ate any of it. The restaurant itself is nice; it has high ceilings and the grilling area is right at the center of the restaurant, so you could pretty much watch your food getting made. I do hope to try Fire Side again, but only after they tone it down a little.

{"text":"Great beer list, good beef burgers, but the wife got a very hard avocado and onions, as in she couldn't even chew it, served up on her black bean burger.  Doubtful we'll be back as a couple at least."}
{"text":"Everything we ate was delicious. Loved the fries. Loved the wings--saucy ones were better than the rubbed ones. Loved the chicken sausage with Gouda. My daughter loved her sliders. 

The service is amazing. I actually wanted to become friends with my servers and bartenders. They work together as a seamless team.

We weren't drinking, but they have a sh%%load of beers on tap, an actual barrel of infused Wiggle Whiskey, and a fun listing of cocktails. 

The only negative is that it is SOOO smoky (grill not cigarette) inside that I left smelling like a campfire and had to remove my clothes. Ventilation is needed. 

We will be back very soon--might be our new go-to place for wings."}
{"text":"So within the last week I ended up eating here twice as two separate friends both wanted to check it out. 

I love the ambiance, particularly how the grilling area is in the middle of the restaurant and that you can see the cooks in action. However, they could have done a better job with ventilation because it got really smoky here after awhile. 

While we were waiting we saw some beautiful dishes being served. They also had a pretty nice selection of beers on tap. I was quite impressed with that. 

I opted for the beer glazed citrus chicken which was under the skillets menu. Hubby opted for the Quebec burger which is like burger with poutine on top.

When the waitress came back with our orders I noted that I had received the wrong thing. Everyone in my table had their food, but I ended up with a completely different item in the skillet section. I swiftly told the waitress who then took the food and admitted to putting in a different order.

Unfortunately, by the time my correct order had arrived everyone had finished their food. I ended up having to share my husbands burger which was pretty good but a little dry.  

Upon trying my food, I felt a little underwhelmed as it was just chicken with some thin sauce that was not that citrusy, and some really cold grilled lemons they had put on my chicken. They seemed to have rushed the order to the point that it was not well executed despite how long it took. 

A week later I decided to come back because our friends were raving about their happy hour wing special. We were a table of 5 this time. 

Hubby and I went for the various wing flavors. Our party placed the order at the same time, but sadly this place had poor timing and served our friends at very different times. The wings, although big and tasty had way way too much sauce, to the point that we were wiping them with napkins.

I know this place recently opened, but one of the things that they really need to work on is their very poor customer service, also if you mess up an order, make it right somehow. All I got in both cases was a disappointing entree and a half ass apology."}
{"text":"Great food but the service was lacking when we went on a warm Monday evening in May. The staff had a hard time waiting on everyone outside & kept missing things from orders. I might go indoors next time to see if there's a difference. It was also a Monday night & pretty full so they may not have planned for the turnout.
The truffle fries, wood fired blackberry bbq wings, & crab stuffed hush puppies were outstanding! I'd have a hard time trying anything else because I'm already craving these again. Had the fried seasoned wings too but they were like any bar wings. I tried 2 mixed drinks. They were good but I thought they were a bit overpriced & small. Not sure that I'd get a drink again. I'd probably just do beer, but their selection was geared too far into IPAs & I prefer lagers, stouts, porters."}
{"text":"4.5 stars, solid. Service was terrific. Great sandwiches and a huge beer selection and it doesn't hurt that they have their own parking lot. We got two apps which were the hush puppies-yummy and the pierogies-even yummier. Hubby got the club. It was huge and very good. I chose the crab cake sandwich. It too was delightful. Not dry and full of crab meat. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried their food, so I can update this review if I ever do.  First of all, there is a legitimate free on-site parking lot for this place, which I feel like is fairly unheard of in east liberty or anywhere in this town where you'll be going out for drinks/bar food. This alone, raised its rating for me.  
Our bartender/server was very friendly and for the most part good at his job.  We were a fairly large group - 10 people, and he did screw up one of the checks, but he fixed it promptly.  I did also hear that one of the members of our group ordered a chicken sandwich, and the chicken was underdone...yikes!
The beer options were excellent, and the cocktails were fun (I didn't try any, but they sounded tasty and I liked the fact that they all had names referencing Anchorman)  After asking the server if they rotate and always reference movies, he informed me they do - which is fun.  I would definitely be willing to come back here and actually try the food, but if all else - it was a great place to drink on a Saturday night since it wasn't crowded and we had room to sit and could hear each other chat."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable: GO.  This is the former home of the Station Street Hot Dog shop, now converted into a restaurant featuring an astonishing array of beers on draft, many locally made.  I had one of their burgers, which was excellent.  Smallish menu, but that often means more fresh items. My son loved the shrimp and grits, which was delicious.  I am pleased to see they offer Arsenal Cider, too. I was helped by Tony, who was excellent and his recommendation for an IPA (the \"H2P\") was spot on."}
{"text":"We visited Fire Side back in December, right before Christmas and while everyone in our party enjoyed their food, we got a little overwhelmed by the smoke from the open grill. Afterwards we smelled like a campfire, and my eyes looked like I had enjoyed some herbal refreshment as said campfire. I'm hesitant to go back, which is too bad because the location is convenient for us in Point Breeze, we did really enjoy the food, and the current menu online looks very appetizing."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a good lunch spot on a Sunday afternoon in this area.  We debated on going to one of our favorite restaurants or trying something new.  We decided to try out The Fire Side.  I was sold by looking at the good looking pictures of their burgers on Yelp.  They looked really good and I was starting to crave them.

     We ended up meeting my brother in law and his girlfriend here.  It wasn't too busy so we found a 4 top table for the four of us.  The waitress greeted us and gave us our menus.  What we noticed right away was that they had different size glasses for their beer.  A smaller one was for around $3.50 and a large beer was around $7.50.  We ordered the larger one and were disappointed to see that it was a normal size beer for $7.50.  We thought that price was good for a tall glass beer not your normal size. 

     Looking around we thought the restaurant was nice.  It was open and we were having a good time.  The waitress was nice and gave us good service too.  

       The problem was our food.  I ordered their Fireside burger cooked medium.  My wife ordered a burger too cooked medium rear.  Our waitress asked how we wanted it cooked but they both came out well done.  We didn't say anything mostly because the food took a while to come out and we needed to get to another place pretty soon.  Otherwise we would have sent it back.  I was disappointed in my burger.  It looked good from the outside.  The picture I took of it looks great  but it was dry and over cooked on the inside.   I had to put ketchup on it to make it better and I hate doing that.  Carrie felt the same way about her burger.  She got a salad too and I ordered fries.  No complaints on the fries and salad they were good.  My brother in law ordered some muscles with his girlfriend and some nachos that looked good too.  I think they enjoyed their food.

      Our experience here with the overpriced beer and over cooked burgers would make me have to give them a 2.  I want to give them a 2 in a half because we did like the place and my brother in law seemed to like his food but that burger was just so bad.

     I would like to try this place again to give them another try.  I like the area and other people have had better experiences here but again it was too expensive for the beer and those burgers tasted like something you get at a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner last night. Overall, the staff was very polite and personable. They checked on us often. I'm not exactly sure who the server was because two people seemed to be taking care of us at different times. While confusing, it was a great to see the staff working as a team because we were well taken care of so and never had to wait for the server.
The restaurant is beautiful and I really Liked the open layout of the restaurant and the dark wood tables. The open kitchen takes up about half of the space. The women's restroom was very clean, however it reminded me of a fast food bathroom with the red tile floor.
Now onto the food and drinks. The cocktails were appropriately titled from Elf the movie (e.g., \"Santa, I know him!\"). They came quickly and were delicious. We ordered two appetizers: the crab hush puppies and the shrimp stuffed avocados. You MUST try the hush puppies!! The sauce was delightful, although we wished for more spice. The puppies themselves were flavorful, crisp on the outside and cooked to perfection. The avocado, on the other hand, was not stuffed. The shrimp and salsa was situated next to a grilled half avocado, which was a bit unripe. The shrimp and salsa did not have much flavor. I wouldn't recommend this.
Entree wise we ordered the asparagus baguette and the shrimp and grits. I Loved the baguette! There was a wonderful jam on the sandwich that really complimented the feta and grilled asparagus. It came with crispy fries on the side. The shrimp and grits were flavorful, but not what we were expecting. The grits tasted like over seasoned warm cornbread batter and the shrimp were tough and overcooked. 
For dessert, we had both the blueberry cobbler and the s'mores. They were served beautifully in tiny cast iron skillets. The cobbler was topped off with fresh vanilla ice cream. Although it didn't have a crumbly crust, it had fragrant lemon undertones that packed a punch! It was lovely. The s'mores was not so great. The first layer was melted chocolate, the second layer was a graham cereal topped with huge toasted marshmallows. It was hard to eat because the marshmallows were not melted and the cereal seemed stale in the melted chocolate. It sounded great, but it just didn't work.
Overall, everything was a hit or miss. I will definitely be back, the burgers looked amazing, and the staff was great!!"}
{"text":"I brought some coworkers to Fire Side after a meeting in East Liberty. This was my second time here for lunch, and the place was practically empty both times. 

I was craving a burger, so I got the Black & Gold burger with fries. Service was a little slow. It took about 30 minutes for us to get our food after ordering. The burger was super juicy. I really like the type of roll they use. It would have been better, however, if they used beef that was a little more lean. The fat was dripping out of the burger onto the plate more than normal, and the bun was also soaked with fat. The fries were seasoned well, thick cut, and nice and crispy.

There are plenty of other burger spots in the city, but this is worth a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"First time going to this restaurant. I have to say I was very surprised! The layout is very cozy & inviting. There's a huge bar, tv's, & high wooden tables. I ordered a martini called \"the fat man in the little coat\" it was amazing, with it's cherry chocolate flavors. To eat I ordered the black & yellow burger, this was the best burger I've ever had, hands down!!! The flavors & toppings were excellent & the bacon was cooked to perfection!! The presentation of my drink & food was awesome, I will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"There are 2 parking lots on each side of the restaurant so don't worry if spaces fill up in one. Seating can be limited for parties more than 2-3. While there are tables near the back, most seating looks like it's at the bar and high tops. It's an open kitchen style so you get a nice view of the grill at the bar, which is cool. Staff are friendly and sometimes more than one person helps you which can be a bit confusing, but I've never had any misunderstandings.

Sriracha maple wings: 6 for $7. Get them charred on the grill for an extra $1 which you can't really get at other places so it's worth a try. Love this flavor and they top it with green onions and bits of bacon. 4/5

Queso burger: $14 with a side of fries. A good sized burger with a Southwest feel of avocado, pico de Gallo, and cilantro lime sour cream. 4/5

Definitely recommend for a good burger and beer."}
{"text":"Why anyone would rate this below five stars just boggles my mind. The cheese steak sandwich was incredible and the poutine fries (French fries with gravy and cheese curds) was so good, I could've gotten another serving. I highly recommend this place for the food and atmosphere. You have to eat here!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here on one of the first nights they were open when they were serving their tasting menu. The menu was limited but still had lots of interesting plates, many of which made the cut to their regular menu now. 
I'm not a vegetarian but I can appreciate a vegetarian plate that's creative and healthy. There are plenty of dishes like the Portobello salad with roasted pistachios that are veggie and awesome. My mom had a burger and fries served on a cool wooden cutting-board looking plate so the presentation was really cool. 
The dining atmosphere is laid back and you've always got something to focus on with the huge grill right in the center. 
All of the staff we had interaction with was really informative about the menu and its items and were relaxed, which is a good thing in my opinion. 
I urge everyone to give Fire Side a try! I'd bet their menu will surprise most."}
{"text":"Love Public House. I have come here a few times because the service and food are always great. The grilled romaine is one of my favorite dishes and it comes with half an avocado. Also a fan of the wings."}
{"text":"My first thought as I entered the restaurant was \"Omg is this place on fire?!\". The smell of smoke is very strong. In an attempt to air out the building, they kept the doors open which made way for flies to roam inside. Nothing I love more than swatting bugs away from my food. 

In my vegetarian world of dainty salads and puny vegetables, Fire Side blows them all out of the water with its colossal black bean burger. Not only was it enormous, it was sooo delicious! The sirarcha aioli was so incredible that it makes the heartburn worth it. Just ask my boyfriend who was practically drinking it. The spinach and avocado topping made the burger even better. It was essentially all my favorites in one burger. Definitely one of the top veggie burgers I've had in Pittsburgh! It must not have been a pretty sight to watch me attack my meal. When a burger is twice the size of your mouth, it's hard to eat like a lady. 

Would I come back? Absolutely! To all my vegetarians, the black bean burger is a must!"}
{"text":"We were here for A Spoonwood Brewery tasting and education. Both of which we never got. We'd ordered A Spoonwood flight, seen their rep talk with a couple of people right next to us and pass us up. Saw rep spend most of his time at a table with two women who were clearly his friends. Turns out the event was supposed to be the rep approaching customers only if they made a Spoonwood purchase. He was to be notified by bartender so he could chat with us. According to the rep he was never informed of our purchase. Overall this seemed a poor way to conduct such an event; both on behalf of the restaurant and the rep. We had onion rings that came with beer cheese made from one of the Spoonwood pours=really good. The chef came and spoke with us about the food. We had a great seat at the bar in front of the wood stove and got to watch the chef and his team in action. Everything coming out looked amazing. Because of this and the chat with the chef we will go back to give the place a second try. If not for him, the lack of organization and communication typically would not afford that. Here's to hoping our next visit is better and their professional game is st"}
{"text":"Good burger. Nice draft list. Awesome wood grill.  We will be back."}
