{"text":"Growing up in the Willoughby-Eastlake-Willowick area, I've been past this bar a million times.  Heck, I used to play putt putt and eat ice cream next door before they tore that business down.  But...something about this place always seemed weird to me.  Maybe it's the location.  Or the fact that it has switched names/ownership more times than I can remember.

But...times are a changin' at The Pub on Six.  I can guarantee that whatever you expect the inside to look like based on what you see on the outside is completely wrong.  This is an incredibly clean, completely remodeled bar.  When I dropped in the bartender was extremely friendly.  I was with my boyfriend and a friend and we were the only patrons on a Tuesday night.  That was a little sad, but we made the best of it.  We were only dropping by for one drink, but I perused the menu while we were waiting.  My boyfriend has eaten there a few times and loves their pot roast sandwich, and although I didn't see anything that seemed vegetarian friendly, I'd imagine they'd be accommodating enough to modify a sandwich or salad.  They also had a martini feature listed on a chalk board and a huge case filled up with a variety of bottled beer.  They're still a relatively new establishment, so they're trying to figure out what food/booze will sell and they're trying to boos their business.

If you're in the area and are looking for a nice laid back place to grab a drink, this is the place to go.  You'll get better service than at any of the other nearby bars and this place will really appreciate your business."}
{"text":"Great little place that finally opened up to limited menu items on Chardon Rd. (the old Clubhouse)  Patio was opened sparingly in July while the inside was being renovated, including new bar and new bathrooms, flooring, seating, booths, all new.  It looks really good in there.  The outside was also redone; new parking lot, landscaping, and a good cleaning.  Patio here is huge and very inviting.

Beer selection is really nice.  Lots of craft beers for you to try and an ever growing wine selection.  Stop by and make a recommendation, these guys want feedback.

Food (limited items) has so far been great.  The smoked Gouda balls are addicting and the club sandwich is huge, delicious, and topped with the freshest ingredients from the Sun Plum market located right down the street.  The market sells fresh produce from local growers and have decided to pair up with the Pub on Six to bring some fantastic dishes in the future.  I will keep providing feedback as they add items to the menu.  Oh yeah, the fries, how could I have forgotten so easily.  The fries are cut fresh and fried / seasoned perfectly in peanut oil.  Apparently the partners attempted batch after batch until just getting it right.  I'd say they are pretty darn close.

This weekend was their 1st annual Clam Bake and it went seemingly well.  Small blip in the clams, butter, and deserts but everything served to the 60+ customers was spot on.  We had 8 people in out group and the overall reaction to the food, ambiance, and service was solid.  We all loved the desert made from scratch especially the Frangelico whipped cream topping.

So I'm leaving the extra star out of this review until I can try other dishes and see some consistency out of this new establishment.  So far so good.

Other points of interest:

-New jukebox ($1 a song is steep)
-No bar games but I think photo hunt is on the horizon
-No baby changing station in bathroom but we managed
-No decor on walls yet but they're probably waiting for the paint to dry
-No CC machine.  Cash or Check only
-Nice smokers area for the wintertime
-Bad cell reception but free Wi-Fi (Pretty sure)
-Huge bar with large TV's
-Decent Happy Hour specials (more to come)
-Not open on Sunday but might be opening early on Saturdays for the football games
-Look for trivia coming soon and special events throughout the year

As you can tell, I'm pretty excited for this business to thrive.  Now get your butts over there and show The Pub on Six some love......with cash or check."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out a few weeks ago because we had noticed it changed names once again. We were delightfully suprised, it was fresh and clean and trendy inside. The had a decent size cooler for beers but not the greatest selection, a lof of off the wall tastes. We tried quite a few that we had never heard off, checked out the menu and everything seemed fresh and modern. In talking to the bartender, we were told they have limited freezer space so almost everything is made fresh and to order. You can tell its a martini bar because of the random mixers and liquers behind the counter, we took advantage of this though. In our openminded and creativeness we made pb & j shot with real pb that they use in the martinis. As well as chocolate covered bananas with the banana puree they had. We got our Elvis on and even had a peanut butter and banana creation. It was a super cool night to be in a low key spot having a blast with the bartender and fellow patrons. We will be back to try the menu out and I'm sure we won't be dissapointed."}
