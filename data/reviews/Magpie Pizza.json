{"text":"If you are looking for pizza, Magpie is among the elite. The pizza is among the best I have had. The service has been consistent with each and every visit. It may be a bit pricey, but is reasonably priced for what you get. The ingredients are clearly fresh, without a doubt. Overall, consistency is what has brought me back to Magpies."}
{"text":"Love Magpie! Great selection of pizzas salads and sandwiches. Very creative. Good beer and wine selection. Staff is always very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"How can I give Magpie the credit it deservers? The pizza is amazing and the staff are awesome! Jess is one of our favorites and the owner, I think his name is Jim, seems like a great guy. He has come out to our table and chatted for a bit, just enough to give the experience a personal touch. My husband coaches a youth soccer team and we have brought the parents and players in after games to celebrate. They have always been more than accommodating to 1. a large group and 2. a large group of kids. Jim has even come out and done magic tricks for the kids. BTW....the Pyrus pizza rocks!!!"}
{"text":"In all fairness....how can I rate the food? We walked in at 7:50 on a Sunday night-exited to eat at Magpies and we were told they ran out of food! An hour before closing....really disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food,  great people,  and superior service.  Great drink prices and eclectic menu items.  Try the Adonis pizza!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had, literally! I ordered a small cheese with truffle oil drizzle for me and my son and my husband had an Italian sandwich. The sauce is fresh crushed tomatoes with great flavor and the crust is the perfect thickness. My husband loved his sandwich and it was a great portion as well. Prices were very reasonable for the amazing quality ingredients. I can't wait to go back and try some of their amazing specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"Best pizza around! Very fresh ingredients and the crust is amazing! The salads are really flavorful! Very welcoming atmosphere, great for getting together with family and friends! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here regularly for about 2 years. The regular staff are great - big shout out to Jessie! The owner, Jim, is great. The food is *always* fresh and very tasty. The pizza is delicious (and I am a NYC chica!!).  My adolescent son has come here alone many times over the years or w friends, and the boys are always given the same courteous treatment - I greatly value this! Fresh food, great environment, and wonderful staff - what more could you ask for? (Actually, I'd like some new salad dressing options. I'm a little bored w the 2 featured ones Thanks!)"}
{"text":"Magpies is all right. Really nice location. The staff is friendly, but the owner has never been so to my group. Drinks are inexpensive. Kids aren't really welcome, so some people will like that. The pizza sounds great, taste OK, but are pricey. I used to go a lot but am taking a break for a while."}
{"text":"If you like thin crust pizza, you will love this place. This is probably the best pizza in a 10 to 15 mile radius of Avon, Ohio."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Oberlin, by far!  The crust is delicious, the ingredients are always so fresh, and it never feels \"heavy\" to me."}
{"text":"Super delicious with great service!  We had the Tuscan and Pyrus pizzas and they were both delicious.  IMO, best pizza in the area!  Great atmosphere too.    I'd give them 5 stars except they don't have milk for kids. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I came here over commencement in Oberlin, and I was SO happily surprised.  Oberlin has been desperately needing new restaurants.  Our server was a sweet college girl who was friendly and happy to talk to us giddy alums.  We ordered 3 pizzas--one with corn & black beans, one with egg and prosciutto, and one veggie.  All very delicious.  The prices were more than typical Obie pizza, but the quality was much better.  It was very well lit and it was great for a huge group.  YAY!  OBIELAND FOREVER!"}
{"text":"Not out of this world but very good pizza with lots of options. Kind of artisan pizza with some odd parings. The location and staff is new but they try hard and are apologetic while they learn. I was here their second day open. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in town. Nice, thin crust lightly dressed. Other than that, I'm not usually in a rush to go here. It's a clean, modern space but it feels more like a cafeteria. If the weather is nice they have nice pub style seating on the sidewalk which is quite pleasant. Salads are unexceptional and the service is hit or miss, but that's the case almost anywhere here in Oberlin - or Cleveland, I'm beginning to think!"}
{"text":"While there's more than a couple pizza joints in Oberlin, magpies is hands down the best! A cheese large pie is only 9 dollars and will fill up a group of 3 with their more than generous slice sizes. Always clean, fast and the staff are super friendly! Can't recommend it enough!! Also have a great variety of food not just pizza."}
{"text":"This was such a super experience!  I can't believe I waited almost a year to order try these guys. First, the atmosphere in there is just hip and cool - kind of like a Chipotle with more style and the take-out service was awesome!  I had a PERFECT caprese salad (the tomatoes were perfectly ripe, basil perfecly fresh, the fresh mozzarella was doughy and wonderful - even the balsamic/olive oil dressing was fantastic - no need to even salt it)!  The Blue Hawaiian pizza was super as well.  Just the right amount for lunch (9\") and the toppings were delicious - thin, lean Canadian bacon and fresh pineapple with just the right amount of mozzarella without the greasy heaviness of a lot of traditional pizza.  I really love this place and would highly recommend it. 5-stars for sure!  I'm going back ASAP."}
{"text":"As if Oberlin needed another pizza shop, Magpies opened its doors in the new college street development this past spring semester. It offers a unique product in the sense that the pizzas are upmarket. There are some interesting topping combinations on the pizzas that are rare finds in other pizza parlors.  The atmosphere is minimalist. However, the subtle colors of the chairs and the image of a Magpie make for nice touches. The patio has an upscale European flair. Fortunately, since there are many windows, this affords for plenty of natural light. The kitchen is partially open air with opportunities to sit at the counter.   When the place first opened, the service had some kinks and it appeared that they were not ready to accomodate the rush of people. However, as things have settled down for the summer, the service has been very friendly and professional. The owner is freakin awesome!  The food is really, really good. The salads are gourmet, fresh and exquisitely prepared. But the pizza is where it is at. On all the pizzas, the crust is finely baked to the point where it is browned and crunchy. There are some brilliant flavor combinations too. The pyrus pizza has gargonzola, pear slices, lettuce and a really flavorful white sauce. The gargonzola is absolutely delish and mouthwatering. This pizza is a brilliant concept because it gives you a salad and a pizza on one plate. Also, there are pizza of the day specials with all kinds of exotic never thought of pizza toppings. The Caeser Salad pizza was enjoyable even for someone who does not normally enjoy Caeser Salad. The asparagus and grilled chicken pizza was also exceptional. The grilled chicken is finely grilled and relatively high quality.   Why not 5 stars? The glaring problem is price. For 7-10 dollars, you get a personal pie (7 inches). A better value is the 14 inch pies which go from 14-20 dollars. Your really getting 4 times the pizza for twice the price. Salads, while excellent, were approaching 6-7 dollars which I found way too pricy for a salad. At least the quality is good though which does warrant the price.   _______________________________________ Location 5/5 Food Quality 14/15 Service 8/10 (10/10 for a certain waiter named Aaron K.)

{"text":"Second time eating here in 2 days. Absolutely delicious personal pizzas and salad. I ordered half cheese, half drizzled in truffle oil. Divine. Strongly recommend the backyard bbq (buffalo chicken) pizza. The Mediterranean and grape & walnut salad were yummy. Our family is from New York so our high standards of a pizza were not only met but exceeded.  The service is also wonderful. Very friendly and accommodating of special requests."}
{"text":"I hadn't tried Magpie yet in large part because other people had told me it was expensive and not worth the price. I don't know if they changed their prices or what but when I went recently it was a good deal. I got the three-cheese pizza and my friend got a customized vegan pie. We both got the individual size and although I had heard they were small we were both satisfied with it. I liked the crust and the flavor of the pizza. My friend liked the variety of toppings including salsa. For vegan pizza they don't use fake cheese; they just reduce the price and get rid of the cheese entirely. It would be nice if they offered some soy mozzarella as a substitute. I also got a Caesar salad which I thought was good. They have outdoor seating and the service was quick even though they were somewhat busy. I expect to pay more for higher quality ingredients, which I know Magpie is into, and so for that I thought it was a good value."}
{"text":"great pizza great sauce I would recommend you go there any eat we had a great dinner and we recommend it to anybody thank you"}
{"text":"We stopped in earlier today after walking around a bit for the yearly Oberlin Chalk Walk (great event by the way!).  This was my very first time in Oberlin, and I was smitten by the sheer beauty and quaintness of this small college town!  In fact, it greatly reminded me of the many years I spent around another great college town, New Paltz, NY (with nearby SUNY), when I was living on the East Coast.  We spent about an hour walking on and around Main Street, taking in all the talented sidewalk chalk artists, and worked up an appetite.  We spotted Magpie Pizza, and being the pizza snob/conoisseur that I am, I just had to stop in.  I would rate this pizza at least 4 and a half stars.  The fantastic crust is light and airy, the sauce and stringy cheese taste fresh and aromatic, without an abundance of herbs or spices.  We ordered half plain, and half pepperoni (my 8 year old wanted pepperoni).  I feel that the true test of a great pizza is-  does it stand on it's own without toppings?  If a plain cheese and tomato pizza is 'done right', it will taste great without toppings.  This pizza definitely does!  I've had some truly great 5 star pizzas in NYC, Chicago, and even Rome Italy ('Rustica pizza' comes to mind) in my 52 years on this rock, and Magpie Pizza is 'up there' as well.  The owners and chefs of this pizza parlor & restaurant should be proud of what they have here!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location (sheffield plaza) is permanently closed. It's a shame, I never got to try it. I have heard nothing but great things about their Pizza. Best of luck to them."}
{"text":"Love the variety of unique pizza options. Great quality, but a bit pricey."}
{"text":"If you want good pizza in this small town, Magpie Pizza is the place to go. Very tasty pizza with fresh ingredients. Come for the pizza, stay for the beer. Their beer selection is relatively limited, but it is great local brews. I had a Rye of the Tiger and Monster IPA and I'm happy with both. Contemporary style and a good mix of classic rock and new rock make a great atmosphere. I will be back, next time I'm in the area and so should you."}
{"text":"Well, this was one of the coolest pizza places around. Great pizza with fresh ingredients. They had to move from Oberlin to Sheffield due to the lack of parking in Oberlin where they were originally. I don't think Sheffield was a good fit for them. If they were able to open in Oberlin again we would surely go."}
{"text":"Two days left in Oberlin and I decided to try the new pizza place in town.  Met a friend here for lunch and it was definitely a great first impression!  It was a sunny day in Oberlin and given the fact that Magpie is in a suite that is street level - corner spot was fabulous.  Bright - Spacious - Quick [By OBERLIN standards!!] - Delicious.  While I can't say that it was pricey, it also wasn't college cheap.  Great addition to the Oberlin downtown!"}
{"text":"First time was great, the ingredients were fresh and the service is fast. I will be returning again."}
{"text":"Seemingly newer place. Nice open concept. The pizza is very good and there is a wide selection to choose from."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   I've eaten pizza from New York to San Francisco, Chicago to Denver, and I have to say Magpie is some of the best pizza I have ever had. Oberlin residents should definitely be proud of what they have here.  Stop in, order the Queen Elizabeth and a beer, and enjoy a seat at the counter watching the chefs. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding. I love the phyrrus pizza and the tuscan pizza. They have great salads too - try the one with oranges and pecans."}
