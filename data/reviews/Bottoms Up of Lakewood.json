{"text":"Apparently, they've started a Ladies Night.  I haven't been yet, but I plan on going soon.  I just thought I would add that in case there are any lesbians floating around yelp!"}
{"text":"Bottoms Up is a nothing special neighborhood bar. They have a lounge in the basement that has stand-up and improv. They have improved their parking lot recently; I believe there is now more parking."}
{"text":"Terrible!  Went here for a friend's birthday celebration and were stayed maybe 5 minutes.

For starters, it was about 90 degrees in this place.  We started sweating as soon as we walked in the door.

Second, the \"strippers\" aka (scrawny boys walking around in what looked like toddler's underwear) were not cute.  The crowd was sketchy.  The bartender looked like a 50 year old guido.

Not cute."}
{"text":"eh! and heck no!  

About a year ago when they first opened I was all about them.. then a few things happened.. 

1. Summer came.. get some freaking AC.. it's hot as HELL in there. 
2. Shady-ness - I've heard nothing but shadyness about the owner of the club.  He screwed over the gay softball league for a pretty large chunk of change. 
3. The Crowd Changed - When it first opened there was a pretty standard mix of people.. now it's turned into a bit rougher crowder.. 

I know that alot of people still go here for Thursday night strippers, but I'd rather support a club that supports the community."}
{"text":"Just a place to go on thursday nights or even the occasional friday.  typical dive type gay bar.  they did revamp the layout, and closed the basement.  their selection on male strippers is so-so at best, with only one or two being tip-worthy.  the drinks are a little weak, i never seem to get really tipsy there for some odd reason.  parking is a easy, if only a little hassle next door at the aldi's parking lot.  most of cleveland's typical men you will see there, but not in a bad way.  the show host/hostess is entertaining.  i usually have a decent night all in all, just wish a few things were tweaked to make it better."}
