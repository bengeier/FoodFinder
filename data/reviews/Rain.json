{"text":"They try way toooo hard to be something they are not.....Kinda like the girls you see wearing Juicy sweat pants in public with knock off designer hand bags!"}
{"text":"This place was great for the first couple of years it was open -- the Miso Black Cod was to die for.... but that was almost 7 years ago now.  Sadly, my last visit was lacklustre to say the least. What used to be a restaurant who's dishes sparkled with interesting flavours and bold styles (albeit they \"borrowed\" heavily from greater influences in New York and London) is now a sad, ghostly reminder of it's former self.  They seem to have gotten lazy. The menu is boring and poorly executed -- even the dessert menu, which used to be the highlight of dinner (understated but wise in it's experiments).  After 7 years, what was a chic resto-lounge has become an overpriced reminder of past glories.  Please, please bring back the dynamism and flare that I loved so much."}
{"text":"I love the show \"Made to Order\". The Rubino Brothers seems to have their stuff together and since I was in Toronto, I had to go to check this place out.   The night that we went, the brothers were not there. We picked the 6 course menu and the food was just ok, nothing spectacular. I was kinda bummed out. I was surprised that the dinner took 4 hours and over $100 per person."}
{"text":"Rain looks like a flash-in-the-pan restaurant, and sometimes acts like a flash-in-the-pan restaurant, but overall, the food has depth and quality, and displays an impressive level of invention.  The Rubino Brothers seem to have their sights set on something bigger than food, or at least on something bigger than Rain. Their series on Food Network Canada (\"Made to Order\") began in the kitchens of Rain and (the now defunct) Luce, but these days, it's more about the jet-setting brothers on a quest to \"top this.\"  That's why I'm surprised and pleased that the food is still very good, and nearly every night I've been there, the Rubinos have been on the premises. Evidently, they still care about Rain, and consequently, so do I.  Rain's menu consists of plates that are smaller than standard entrees and larger than tapas. Diners are encouraged to order several items from the menu and share them. The restaurant also offers a tasting menu that changes frequently.  Guy Rubino deftly melds Asian and Italian flavors. He seems to have an unusually deep understanding of Asian flavors and while his work isn't subtle, it works beautifully. Several of the plates offer three variations on the specific ingredient; this trend is overexposed, but at Rain it's possible to appreciate the intent; you feel as though Rubino is trying to explore the ingredient more than dazzle you. A couple menu highlights: Kurobota pork and persimmons, and any preparation of Arctic char or Wagyu beef is worth ordering.  Robert Gonsalves is the most inventive pastry chef in Toronto; Rain is lucky to have him. His creations are constantly changing so instead of recommending something in particular, let me suggest that you choose desserts that feature the most unlikely combination of ingredients or flavors. You'll be rewarded.  The wine list is adequate - not over-large - and the wines are well-chosen to complement the menu.  A few words about the restaurant itself. It's pretty cool... spare, contemporary, Asian-influenced, like the food... but it's a bit cold and impersonal. The restaurant is certainly intimate, but that's not the same as feeling at home in the space. And the service is sometimes equally chilly. I've been there enough to have reached the conclusion that this is what the Rubinos prefer. But I'd love even a hint of warmth. It makes the experience more memorable."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised this place got such bad reviews. I was in Toronto on business with a group of co-workers. We went to Rain - it was recommended by a local.   Since the menu was a bit confusing we decided to go with the Chef's Menu, an 6 course menu.. Everything was absolutely divine! There was a lobster soup, 2 fish dishes, 2 meat dishes and dessert. All creative dishes and all fabulous.   I plan to visit Rain again on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place as the place to go try in Toronto.  The atmosphere was cooL, and i loved the loft feeling, but it was so empty on a wed. night - given it was a rainy wed. night out in toronto. i was pretty disappointed with what i got for what i paid for.  ordered the 6 course tasting menu. - super expensive, (for ~150/person, i can get a PARTY in my mouth in an equivalent style restaurant in NYC) i guess i expected a LOT more. service was good but SO So Slooooow and strange for the experience/amount we were paying for.  (i was confused since there was about 4 ppl serving us, our waiter explained 1 of the 6 courses, our empty dishes sat at the table for a good twenty mins before someone (not our waiter) would come and ask if we were done with that course, the manager busted one of the courses out, not much was explained, ppl just walked by our table esp our waiter, glanced at it, and walked away)  two and a half hours later, we got our 4th course of the service, on a not so busy & empty wed night.    i got bored of eating by then and just wanted to get the rest over with, which is never a good thing when you're having a chef's tasting menu  i had a glass of riesling, and it came with floaties and it tasted like it had gone bad. but they were quick to change that.  the food lacked seasoning and wow factor.  maybe i'm just bored of the standard (lamb, quail, veal) proteins of standard western/french cuisine, i wanted to be WOWED -- but the flavours were really subtle - which can be great, but i guess you expect a lot of POW with asian ingredients especially if you're going to experiment with them with conventional cooking methods and western style proteins.  everything came out in 3's and almost one of the three was something with foam.  the plates were cool, and looked as though they were designed for the specific courses, but the three different components of the entire dish felt disjointed. why is everything served in 3's? give me one good thing that's amazing. -- maybe i was better off picking one dish from the menu a la carte.  but since our waiter suggested that we should pick a few apps and a few entrees due to the small portions, price wise - it made more sense to choose the 6 course tasting menu instead.  and usually tasting menus are supposed to be the best items on the menu that represent the chef's spread of dishes. (and not just what's not selling that night, esp at a place like this)   i didn't say MMMM, during the entire meal, (everything lacked wow, lacked seasoning, and lacked a BAM factor) -- UNTIL I GOT THE LAST COURSE -- which was the dessert course -- THE TRIO of APPLES -- THAT I HAVE TO SAY SAVED THE ENTIRE MEAL, and my entire experience there. it was awesome. (and made sense to learn that the dessert menu was prepared by a separate pastry chef) i should've just had that dish. it would've saved me a lot of time and money. and i would've been happy with just that all night.  but instead, three and a half hours later, i left with a 300 dollar bill not including gratuity and tax, and i was stuffed with mediocre flavours that i had forgotten about the moment i stepped out of the restaurant.  (i should've spent my $300 and 4 hours at PER SE in nyc, and had 14 courses of wow)  eh~"}
