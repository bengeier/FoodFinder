{"text":"We went for a short trip to Montreal during Memorial day weekend and had dinner at Akbar.

Great food, good host.

The food is amazing, service is excellent. The family that runs really treats their customers very well and much more friendly than typical restaurants.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and I wasn't overly impressed. The food was barely warm, the naan was mostly dry and hard... quality is mediocre, I've definitely had better butter chicken. And the delivery guy asked if I gave a tip WHILE I was still using the interac machine. 
I'm curious if dining in is better but I likely won't order delivery from them again"}
{"text":"This Teeny Tiny little BYOW Indian resto is run by a lovely couple and is located in the west end of Pierrefonds.  I went there on a whim with a couple of family members last Thursday evening and it was a very nice surprise. To start we ordered some Indian inspired eggrolls, which were ok.  For my main I had the Navrattan Korma (vegetarian) Platter that came with assorted vegetables in a delicious sauce accompanied with chickpeas, green salad, rice and nan.  It was very filling and delicious. Everyone else ordered The Butter Chicken or the Tikka Masala which got a resounding thumbs up by all. The rice was fluffy as was the nan.  I would have liked a little more salad - but honestly I was stuffed by the end of the meal.

The service was very friendly and helpful to say the least. My husband broke the neck of the wine bottle he was opening and cut his hand - the owner/waiter administered first aid and they even brought a sieve so he could strain the wine which they all proceeded to drink! (I drank my wine in the screw cap bottle thank you!) - All's well that ends well - they are still alive to tell the tale after drinking the wine. Crazy people. 

As I said it's a BYOW and they have take out and delivery. Online reservations can be made at chef.akbar@live.ca"}
