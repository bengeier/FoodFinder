{"text":"We ordered on Valentine's Day and knew that it would take a bit longer than usual. Unfortunately it took way longer than we though. It was completely understandable and an expected situation. Overall a positive experience since they handled the situation well and we got a partial discount.   Sorry it happened this way but staff handled the situation extremely well.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"The buffet lunch is very reasonable, with a good selection of meat and vegetable dishes, breads and rices, salads and condiments and Indian desserts. Especially pleasant to have clean plates for each round. The buffet was not too spicy. If you ordered off the menu you could select the heat level. Look forward to returning."}
{"text":"My first time going there, I was a little unsure of the atmosphere and to my surprise, everything was awesome!! The people who work there are nice and they have really exquisite food that knocks you off your feet! I would say this is one of the best restaurants I have been to here in the Pittsburgh area! I love the Masala chicken and the curry rice is awesome!! The lunch buffet is about $9 but you eat all you want."}
{"text":"I usually come for the lunch buffet which I think is a good deal.  Love the chai - make sure you get some!  I get the chicken vindaloo which isn't bad and most of my friends love the chicken mango, which isn't bad either.  :)  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Indian food in a welcoming atmosphere. The lunch buffet is delicious, but the dinner entrees are just as affordable and super tasty."}
{"text":"?????????? D ???????????!! ?????D Chai tea ????????^^"}
{"text":"Way better than India Garden. The interior isnt that great, but the food more than makes up for it. The buffet is a great price and you get a good selection."}
{"text":"I am disappointed.  I have lived in the neighborhood for over 6 years and I keep giving them a second chance (and a third).  The take out menu says in big letter on the front 15% off take out.  So we ordered again, although we generally get poor service and the food is average at best.    This time we ordered 2 entrees and and a few sides.  When I went to pick up the order they had given us 15% off ONE ENTREE.  So it was no discount at all.  When you mention something to them about poorly worded menu and the principle of false advertising they argue with you.    So we are done with them, no more peoples we will drive down to Taste of India from now on."}
{"text":"Me and my wife are used to with Indian food and spice. That's what we cook at home and eat.  We ordered Lamb Biriyani and Chicken makhani for dinner to go last night. To our surprise-  looking at the size of portion of two dishes which cost almost $24 was disappointing! There was literally 4 small pieces of chicken in  chicken makhany. Rice looked  dry and hard. Both dishes smelled a little wierd to my wife.  I did not care, I was hungry. I ate. She followed , seeing me.  We said to keep spice level medium. The spice level was way too hot for guys who actually eats a lot of spice. So, thank God, we did not feed to our 3 year old!  Half an hour after eating the Biriyani, my stomach started to cramp, and here we go- stomach flu.  Both of us started to have the same lower  stomach pain and loose motion last night.  It has been almost 20 hours. Both of us still having stomach pain, discomfort.   Not sure what's going on with this restaurant! This was the first time I went to this restaurant.  I talked to few friends about the incident. It seems they are newly opened. And none of my desi community friends went to this place before.  So enter at your own risk. :("}
{"text":"WORST INDIAN FOOD IVE EVER EATEN. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. The food is very bland and extremely oily. I was very confused as to when the Indian flavors were coming...they were not. With so many Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh that are actually good. You should go there and not waste your money and cheat day at Peoples Indian Resturant."}
{"text":"Their lunch buffet cannot be beat.  Cheap and delicious Indian food."}
{"text":"Was one of my favorite Indian restaurants. I feel they fell off a bit especially when it comes to take out. I like about a 6 in the spicy department. I have dined in plenty of times so I know how their usual 6 taste. So when I order it to go I thought it would be the same. Sadly mistaken, it was a 1. I called to let them know and to my suprise they didn't care. Nor did they even want to rectify this mistake. My advice to you for to go, try it before you leave because there may be no turning back."}
{"text":"So far this place is number one for Indian delivery. Good spice level and complex flavor."}
{"text":"People's always hits the spot when I'm in the mood for casual, yet delicious Indian food. My go to is the vegetarian thali, where you can get a try of two choices, plus chai and bread. The buffet during lunch time is decent, but I'd opt to order off of the menu. Also, it's byob. I'm sure I'll be back soon as I'm craving it after again! The spice levels are on point too, so a 7 is pretty spicy!"}
{"text":"Chicken Tikka Masala. Chicken Curry. Garlic Naan.   Haven't gotten this on Grub Hub a million times and it is TREMENDOUS.   While I don't often get it, I would say the lunch buffet is arguably the best value in the Burgh."}
{"text":"I love People's. It is one of the best indian restaurants in pittsburgh. Always a solid meal, quick and delicious takeout."}
{"text":"The food is alright, but for the buffet price I will eat alright food over and over.  The lunch buffet is full of great food, with hot milky chai and multiple chutneys included.  The restaurant isn't clean, sometimes they take awhile to refill the steam trays, and it's kind of loud.  But it's cheap and decent.  Best way to fill yourself up on a cold day on the east end."}
{"text":"Prices are excellent, food is EVEN BETTER. I am a vegetarian, and found the selection and quality to be just as good as Indian restaurants charging double the price. I attend a convention annually in Pittsburgh, and \"People's\" will definitely be on the \"must visit\" list for future years."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. Looks pretty sketchy from the outside, but it is great, authentic Indian food. Had it delivered and it came in time/as promised. Decent prices, great food, nice guys that run it. You should definitely go there. :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for brunch. At first we felt the food was a little expensive and then realized that the restaurant is getting rid of the tipping system. The food tastes good here. The portion was just right for a meal -- felt comfortably full."}
{"text":"I hate to be harsh, but this is the worst Indian food I have ever had, by far. So so bland, no heat, the rice looked like it was out of a box. Prefer my gulab jamun warm and theirs is cold. I mean, it was like $8 so I guess you get what you pay for. I was just extremely disappointed in the quality"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a lot of amazing Indian food at a decent price. Their buffet is great and they add quite some variety. Their food is flavorful. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"All around great experience. Had the special biryani with a little extra heat added it was really well done, the saffron came through and the lamb was delicious. Girlfriend had the chicken tikka and that was also impressive. The service was the best of all, wanted for nothing and barely waited even though it was packed."}
{"text":"This is the go to place during lunch. All you can eat buffet for a very reasonable price food is delicious and they carry a wide variety my favorite is the price with the cheese masala and salad with yogurt cucumber sauce it's delicious I recommend anyone to come here for a classic Indian experience"}
{"text":"Best palak paneer. Hands down.did a palak paneer test a few years agos.. included graphs and etc... still have my heart. the spicey could be spicier.. ill just throw that out there...."}
{"text":"I just wrote a bad review so I want to counter it with a good one. People's Restaurant easily wins the top slot on Kelly G's list of the best Indian food in Pittsburgh. The restaurant itself is small and no-frills (Indian shabby chic, you might call it), but they have a big table in the middle suitable for large parties. Their lunch buffet is smaller than India Garden's but slightly more delicious. Greg B. and I get take out, add a bottle of wine, and have romantic dinner parties-for-two on our front porch. Perfection."}
{"text":"So I had never heard of this place before a friend suggested that we dine there.  But I'm so glad that I went because the food was delicious!  On top of that, the staff was really nice.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food with a pretty decent setup.  We loved it here.  Yelp, thats how we found it. Street parking, there is ample at night.  We reached at 8 and were seated immediately. Tables are not huge but are neat. Staff is courteous and attentive. They serve complementary roasted papad with chutney.  We ordered paneer masala - yummy, dal makhani - awesomely awesome with lachcha parantha- I have had better lachcha parantha in past this one was okayish n onion naan- this was good.  Food was served without much wait, which was pleasing as we were hungary after the day's activities.  They serve jeera rice with the entree, which was also good. Overall Food tasted great.   We give them 5 stars based on 1 visit during a tourist visit to Pittsburgh; it proved a nice one."}
{"text":"People's Indian Restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food is fantastic (particularly the lunch buffet) and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. And I should point out that the prices are incredibly reasonable - $9 for a high-quality lunch buffet is just great."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet with a mix of vegetable and meat choices.  Small dining room with great service. The clientele is a mix of everyone from doctors to construction workers. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I've only eaten the lunch buffet here, which is cheap and pretty decent.  Maybe it's an unfair assessment, but I wouldn't go out of my way for dinner here based on what I've eaten at lunch.  The food is good, but pretty far from what I consider \"authentic\".  The chai is the real standout, I always get some, even in hot weather.  Bottom line: a great place for a quick, tasty lunch, but I'd search elsewhere if you've got a real craving for Indian food."}
{"text":"We ordered a delivery of food for seven people on new years eve. Ordering online through yelp was fun and easy. Our food was delivered with surprising speed, and we tipped the driver handsomely. The food was all there and even a little extra naan was thrown in! I think we might have been missing some rice but the extra naan made up for it. The food was very very good. Everyone agreed that the spice levels were accurate, and thoroughly enjoyed their meals. It was an excellent experience and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves great food and good service!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. I was introduced to People's by a friend about 16 years ago. He grew up eating Indian food and told me that people's was the best around. Now that I have traveled and tried Indian food in many different places, I have to say I still favor people's.   Also, aside from the quality of food, the staff is always very kind and the restaurant is always clean. And the price of the lunch buffet is awesome. I especially recommend the lunch buffet for first timers who maybe don't know what they want, but are interested in trying Indian food.   The samosa are the best and I can't get enough of the aloo gobi!"}
{"text":"I have been a few times for the lunch buffet and for 9$ it was rather good. It has your Indian basics. They use chicken and lots of veggies to keep the price down but it's still very good. I also like the small dessert bar they set up. I say if you looking for a filling on the heathy side lunch this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Had delivery from People's last night and was pretty happy with the experience. We ordered Shahi Kofta, Roti, Chicken Tikka Masala, Naan, and Samosas. My only complaint is that the Roti was kind of burnt. Otherwise, the food was solid and the spice levels were good. Delivery took about 50 minutes, which I think is reasonable for a weekend."}
{"text":"Closest Indian restaurant to me, and although it is on busy (at times) Penn Avenue, there always seems to be plenty of street parking. I have only done take out, but the atmosphere is pleasant and the staff very friendly.  Preparation time was very fast so there is not a long wait if you haven't called in an order.  I was not exactly blown away by the chicken korma , my favorite dish and yardstick for Indian food, but the vegetarian version was very good. The nan is good, but the samosa was a bit over-cooked. The clincher for me is that they are the only place I have been able to find mango mousse, one of my favorite deserts.  It is thick and flavorful, and not like mango-flavored whipped cream that I have had in other places (not in PGH). It is worth trying this place at least once just for the mousse!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner twice in 1 week when I was craving Indian food. The food is pretty good compared to other Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Also, it's BYOB with no corkage charge. The service is also great. Just took off one star for the naan- it was a little burnt each time I came here."}
{"text":"I have update my reveiw from last time on here.  While I have loved this restaurant for quite a while this evenings service was a bit on the slip shod side.  I think that it is a possibility that my waitress was brand new.  She was having trouble listening to what I ordered.  I thought carefully about what I wanted tonight and ended up just going with the old favorite of chana masala with some vegetable samosa.  She said, \"is that the chicken tikka masala that you want?\"  I said, \"no I would like the chana masala which is chick peas and vegetables with sauce and spices.\"  After it was cooked she brought me the chana masala with no samosa.  So I said, \"where is the vegetable samosa?\"  To this she replied, \"you just ordered the chana masala\" and I said, \"no I also ordered that with some vegetable samosa.\"  She did end up correcting her mistake and apologizing after she brought the samosas.  As far as the chana masala goes it was just o.k. tonight.  It had a tangy sauce with some decent spices, but not as much of a thick tomato sauce as I have had at other Indian restaurants.  I thought the portion size was very good because I did not go away hungry, but it was also a bit on the salty side.   As an aside I think that I am a bit more picky when it comes to dishes.  I am sure this waitress will get the hang of things eventually I would hope."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in whole of Pittsburgh. I have tried every single indian restaurant here this one is the best among all. Little bit on the expensive side but worth it."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed eating at People's Indian Restaurant for years. I appreciate the authentic cuisine, the reasonable prices and excellent service.  The menu has lots of vegetarian options. The Vegetarian Thali is an especially good choice."}
{"text":"People's is literally around the corner from me.  Their lunch buffet is very good and for two people it's about $20, including tip and it's a great value.  The four stars is for the buffet.  I was babysitting one of my rental places and was craving Indian so I ordered through grub hub for delivery.  I ordered two entrees (Aloob Ghobi and Aloo Saag) and naan baked w/ ground lamb.  With delivery, tax, and tip, it was nearly $35.  The entrees were in pint containers that were about 2/3rds full.  There was a pint container of basmati rice, which was cold.  I asked for a 6 spiciness - I like spicy food but this was just about at my threshold - a notch spicier and it would have been inedible.  The food was good, but I thought the portions were the size if you'd gone to an Indian restaurant, ordered two entrees, and had leftovers.    I would stick to eating in--it's a much better value."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with the $9 lunch buffet. So reasonably priced and the food is unreal!! The samosas we so crispy and tasty. Since I did the buffet I got to try a little bit of everything and it was ALL fantastic! Ended it was some killer rice pudding and Gulab Jamun (the sugar milk ball things)...great price, great food. I was in heaven. And not too busy on a Saturday afternoon which was nice."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken vindaloo at spice level 10 and garlic nan as take out.  The chicken vindaloo was quality.  I enjoyed it.  It wasn't super spicy, but I'm used to that.  I've never found Indian food with the same level of heat as I've had in England.  The garlic nan was amazing.  Nice garlic smell, visible chunks of garlic, nicely toasted bread, everything about it was very good."}
{"text":"I've ordered for delivery a few times.  Although you get small portions for the price..the food is pretty good.  This time I and a coworker ordered 2 seperate dishes that came with rice.  They combined the rice in one container.  Why?  My coworker leaves in 10 mins with my rice....ugh!  Called the restaurant and all I get is a ...\"wellll..I don't know what I can do?\"   Are you serious?"}
{"text":"My first and last experience:  Worst delivery service.  My food order was given to someone else waiting for another food delivery in the apartment lobby without even asking which restaurant she had ordered from.  Delivery guy was rude, and said that the girl in the lobby was Indian and thought she was my girlfriend, instead of apologizing.  Never ordered from here again."}
{"text":"I usually don't go to Indian restaurants because I find my own Indian cooking way better than any Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh (Yeah I'm snooty that way). But on this occasion, I was craving Indian food and was too tired to bother cooking. People's turned out to be a revelation.. even for the 'hard to please when it comes to Indian food' patron that I am. They had a variety of Chaats (a sweet, spicy and tangy appetizer). I tried the samosa chaat and loved it. Their menu is quite extensive. I was lost for choice at first (several vegetarian options) but went with the Bhindi Masala, Malai Kofta and the Garlic roti. The curries are not your standard creamy red sauces that you find in other restaurants but refreshingly flavorful. You can actually taste the tomatoes and the spices in the curry here as opposed to just one overwhelming flavor. I also tried some of my friend's paneer naan (bread stuffed with indian cheese) and definitely recommend it. For an Indian, I'm quite the spice-wuss.. so I picked a 6 on their hotness scale. It still ended up being a bit too hot for me. So if you're like me, and not a fan of hot, go lower than 6. They also have 8 different types of biriyani (a rice pot dish) which I didn't try on this trip but will definitely go back for. As stuffed as I was, I had to have a masala chai at the end of my meal and I'm very glad I did. It wasn't thick full fat milky chai that's usually served at Indian restaurant that usually is too much to handle for me but just the perfect end to a fabulous meal. I also must mention the gracious and friendly service. YAYYY such a surprise find! Definitely try it."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 different gravies including veggie, chicken and lamb - they all tasted and looked same. The chicken tandoori coat was red colored and spicy however inside tasted sweet. Totally disappointed with food."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this Bloomfield gem. The spicing is always fantastic, and the staff are wonderful. I have had a few experiences when the service was a bit slow, which would be my only complaint. Don't come and expect a quick meal unless you call ahead for takeout. However, they are BYOB, which has led to many memorable special occasion dinners for us here. Do yourself a favor and get the Bagan Bharta, and then try any of their saag dishes. The naan is divine and comes out crisped and perfect every time. The best deal for dinner is the vegetarian meal platter, which offers 2 entree items, rice, naan, raita, dessert, tea and pickles. I will be back. The food is so good, you'll dream about this place!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food! We got the aloo gobi, the lamb korma, the channa masala, and the palak paneer, level 4 out of 10. The chickpeas were quite spicy, but everything else was the perfect level of spice. We also got garlic naan, which could've been a little bit larger, but the flavor was great. The restaurant gives a free salad with a cracker at the beginning with a few sauces for free! I now live pretty close to this place and I think I will be getting takeout from them at least once a week! Highly recommended, and not just because Pittsburgh has few Indian options!"}
{"text":"Went to the lunch buffet. Its $10 and worth the price. Since I'm a novice when it comes to Indian food, I stuck with the meat selections and rice. The food was good and the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"It's a travesty that I haven't written People's a review yet. I may have dined in or taken out from People's over 100 times. That is not a joke. At one point, years ago, I'm pretty sure they knew our take out order by heart. At which point, all we had to do was call and begin to order the first item and they completed the rest.   So, People's is great. The staff there are super friendly and the lunch buffet is a great deal.  I tend to stick to several favorites on the vegetarian menu like the Vegetable Korma, Palak Paneer, and Matar Mushrooms. Their naan is super tasty as well."}
{"text":"I would write a \"0\" review if I could. I cannot review the food. I did not get a chance to eat there. Me and my Hawaiian friend went there to grab what I heard was some great Indian food, during one of the \"Unblurred\" Friday evenings. The concierge looked at us disdainfully, and was talking about how the 3-4 empty tables we saw was reserved. No \"reserved\" signs were in sight on these tables and dude did not mention when any seating would be freed up.   Whether or not he was prick or or a racist prick, I have no idea. He seemed more interested in getting us out of there than he was in trying to serve us. It is Garfield, so may be he has had issues with the local denizens causing trouble, who happen to look like me. Dunno. All the white people get to eat, we do not?   With the exception of the Awesome Spak Brothers, I would not bother eating anything on Penn Avenue. Ever. I spend more time focusing on the surrounding crap than I do with actually eating."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The flavor in the tiki masala was so bland. I really wish they'd put more love into their spices."}
{"text":"This is a great little BYOB spot in Garfield. I've never made it there for the lunch buffet, but I've dinner a few times and it's always been great. I've had a few Biryani dishes as well as Chicken Tikka Masala and it's all been delicious. It's a great place to go with friends so everyone can share and try a little bit of everything. Friendly service, delicious food, worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday evening around 6pm. The place was empty - they seem to mostly do takeout/delivery work during the week.  For a group of 4 we had our pick of the tables.  The menu has a wide variety of options, some classic, some more obscure. I was feeling like paneer makhani (butter paneer). I ordered that and we had garlic naan to share. I also ordered a salty lassi.  The paneer was great, and they give a very generous amount of both paneer and rice with the dish (other places can really skimp on paneer, but not here). I ordered a 7, which is my go-to for places that scale 1-10. It was a little hotter than I was expecting, so maybe adjust your expectations. The garlic naan was also delicious. The salty lassi left a bit to be desired - I'm used to more cumin/general spice.  Reasonable price, attentive service, and good food! I'll be back to check out the lunch buffet for sure."}
{"text":"Two words: Chicken Mango. There is nothing like it in any Indian restaurant I've been to before or since.   Other than that dish, Peoples is pretty typical of small Indian restaurants. The buffet is alright, the portions are of average size and the service is reasonably good."}
{"text":"I don't care for the lunch buffet because of its limited options (mostly potatoes and beans for vegetarians, sometimes some previously frozen veggie medleys) and lack of spice (for understandable reasons), but for dinner, especially take out, I give Peoples 4 stars.   I usually get either Baingan Bartha or Aloo Gobi, as well as a dal and a plain naan. The dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two. I've tried to stop letting that perplex me, but I can never remember the one they don't have and often try to order it. Maybe my take out menu is outdated in that I should cross that one out. Ok, now on to important stuff...I order a spice level of 10 out of 10. The results are dynamite! Instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil, I can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice. They also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes. Each bite is a mouth explosion. And I love mouth explosions!   This restaurant has it's shortcomings, but since it's the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure, I am a big fan."}
{"text":"I stopped in last night at about 9:45, they were about to close the kitchen so I got my order to go. I noticed the restaurant for the first time while driving past and immediately craved Samosas. Best samosas ever! I got the Rice Byriani with Lamb. Amazing !! The homemade yogurt sauce they give you on the side for the rice was delicious. If you like Indian food, this place is for you. I'll be back - probably tomorrow."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of stopping here for dinner on a recent trip to Pittsburgh and I was very happy that I did. The service was friendly, the food was exceptional and the prices were terrific! I'll definitely return if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"This is probably the best north indian restaurant in Pittsburgh (Lawrenceville/Bloomfield). A bit of a dive with a traditional menu but the food is made fresh and the prices can't be beat.  The lunch buffet is a prety good deal (much less than $10!)."}
{"text":"food and service is decent but the rancid smell from the kitchen makes it smell like garbage or something is wafting out like they just walked by with a garbage can every 5 minutes, weird smell, garbage has a particular smell you cant forget"}
{"text":"This is closer to home-cooked Indian food than your average Indian restaurant. The lunch buffet is yummy. The chai is absolutely delicious!  I am there almost every weekend for their lunch buffet. Yes, it is that good!"}
{"text":"Not great ..... Service was not friendly or fast....waiters cologne was overwhelming and unpleasant samosas were salty and didn't have the curry flavor that I'm used to...,chicken saag didn't have enough sauce and under seasoned I tasted the heat but once again lacked that Indian curry flavor.....I'm really angry at the people who recommended this place."}
{"text":"Come here for the food. Best Indian food I've ever had. Slightly spicy and very flavorful. Aloo Paratha was ok, everything else was excellent, from the chicken mango, chicken vindaloo and Palak paneer.  No cork fee which I've come to expect from living in NJ."}
{"text":"Whether takeout or eat-in, this place is always delicious.  The buffet is a great value!  The premises are a little small, but the staff is very nice, and the atmosphere feels cozy rather than cramped.  The tandoori chicken is a big favorite of the hubby's, and I delight in the various vegetarian curries, perfect naan, and tasty little desserts.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Indian restaurant in town. Well marinated meat, balanced, tasty curries and good apps"}
{"text":"Peoples is my  favorite delivery place! Love the garlic nan but I will say it's better in house than delivered. The mango chicken is delicious. We always order a biryani rice dish. From the vegetarian list love the vegetable Shia korma- but will mention it is very rich, the aloo sagg, and the shai kofta- also quite rich. The lunch buffet is good and love that you can have chai with it because their chia is tasty. It's funny we never eat in for dinner so I have no idea what that's like. But yeah take out for dinner and buffet for lunch. Love!"}
{"text":"Indian buffet serve till 2:30 p.m. Everything you would expect to have on an Indian buffet and more. Everything was very good seasoning a and flavor. Plus Buffet is only under $10! it's a small place, but very welcoming. Recommended"}
{"text":"love this place. doesn't look like much but food is consistently good. the delivery is great and the variety is enough. except they really don't have dessert. I always get the lamb kimi curry (?) its amazing, but buffet has everything"}
{"text":"I have only had the lunch buffet, which really isn't fair to write a review off of.  While cheap and I would consider a good deal, it was overall greasy and bland.  Once I go back and order something off the menu I will have to re-review."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order out from a People's at least once a week. It is a literal 2 minute drive from our apartment so we are all about this place. We've noticed that it can take a little while to get served/food to arrive at the table if you dine in (assuming because of how busy their take out service is) so we tend to opt for take out. I am a vegetarian but my boyfriend is not, so People's is a great choice because of all the options for both of us. I have dreams about their vegetable shai korma, but have had nothing bad to say about any of their food. Spice levels are true to the number you pick and won't arrive unexpectedly hot. People's is a great choice for casual Indian food when you are craving something flavorful and authentic in a short amount of time."}
{"text":"As always so good! The chicken tikki masala is so yummy and spicy! The garlic naan is incredible! Picked up those items and some samosa for take away one night earlier this week and my partner and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I haven't been for the Sunday brunch buffet in a few years but this reminded me we need to hit it up!   PS: The staff was extremely pleasant. Two, very enthusiastic, thumbs up from this guy!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I don't often eat Indian food. I haven't had any bad experiences or anything, I just don't find myself craving it. But after this one, I may.   We arrived on a Saturday for the lunch buffet around 12 and went straight to a table and grabbed plates. Huge disclaimer: LUNCH BUFFET IS $8.45. Yes you heard me $8.45.   To be honest I tried a bit of everything and can't really remember what it all was, but everything (except this one spinach dish) was really tasty. I really appreciated the fresh fruit also, but I did feel like when they ran out, they didn't plan on bringing more out. I took the last scoop of fruit and 10 mins later went back hoping there would be more, but there wasn't. Probably on me to ask and I didn't though.   I will absolutely be back"}
{"text":"I placed a catering order for about 60 people for a group at Carnegie Mellon University. The ordering process was fantastic. I called and gave all the details of the event and how much I was able to spend. A menu was created based on my budget and preferences. (Heavy vegetarian options needed.)  When the day came, the food arrived hot, on time and was tasty! We had some leftovers and enjoyed them just as much the next day, too."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood recently, had a hankering for Indian food, and decided to give this place a whirl and pick up some takeout for dinner. I got chicken vindaloo for my husband and aloo mattar for myself (and garlic naan, of course, because I'm pretty sure it's against the law to eat Indian food without naan). Because we were both recently recovering from the stomach flu (and I had no idea how their spice scale is calibrated), I went easy on the heat and ordered each at a level 4.  The verdict? Sadly, kinda meh. The sauces in both dishes had textural issues...the aloo mattar sauce wasn't as creamy as I'd prefer, and the vindaloo sauce was a little watery. And the biggest bummer was that both dishes were pretty bland. One of the main reasons that I love Indian food so much is because of the spices...and I'm not just talking about heat, but the multi-dimensional, warm, aromatic, earthy flavors that this cuisine is known for. Unfortunately, the flavors fell pretty flat in both dishes. On the positive side, the chicken in the vindaloo was very tender and cooked perfectly, as were the potatoes in the aloo mattar.   Overall, while the meal wasn't terrible, it isn't Indian food that I'd go out of my way to get again."}
{"text":"I am in town for work and I decided to order food from here. The food was awesome! I ordered the People's Special Biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room. I will definitely order from here again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a few years and remembered I enjoyed it in undergrad, especially for late night half off. Called in advance to make sure they were open until 10 and had half off like they used to. The woman who answered the phone said yes to both so I rushed over. The portions were small, but I assumed it was because it was half price so I shrugged it off. The tomato sauce was chunky and generic, the raita side dish was 4 spoonfuls big, and the chutney dips were cold and bland. Assuming this was due to the discount, I didn't complain. Receive my check to find out it was all full price. Despite the woman telling me on the phone that it was half off, it was buy one get one half off. The woman on the phone was the same as the hostess. She admitted it was she who answered yet refused to accommodate her mistake. I don't normally feel compelled to complain but that is ridiculous. A subpar meal and subpar service in addition to false marketing. Never going back despite the fond memories I had accumulated when in school. Completely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Love this place! The fact that it's incredibly close to home is a wonderful bonus. I'll completely stuff myself at the lunch buffet from time to time, but my real weakness is calling in an order and running down the street to pick it up. I may do this a little too often. I like to try new things every so often, but even sticking with my go-to of Chicken Curry never leaves me anything other than happy. I'm so thrilled they've stuck around during the awful construction on Penn Ave."}
{"text":"At first glance I wasn't too impressed with the buffet, I thought it'd be another botched attempt of authentic Indian food. While the selection is not that impressive, I would say that the quality is pretty damn good.  I debated for a long time with my friend about the food going back and forth between a 3 and a 4. I ended up going with the 4 due to the Indian tea that they had - hard to find at any buffet!.  They aren't trying to wow you with exotic ingredients or fun twists, it's almost as if you're sitting down at someone's house and eating what they'd eat on a regular basis. Plus you're paying around 9 dollars for a buffet, I mean- let's get real. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Excellent, balanced, homemade cuisine. Impressive balance of flavors. Very reasonably priced lunch buffet. Even the chai was delicious."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time recently.  It's a great little hole in the wall place with wonderful Indian food.  Everything was delicious and came out promptly, and portions were generous.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  One unique thing about this place is they serve \"Thalis\" which are a fun experience where you have a special dish with a variety of small circular dishes within it with various food items and accoutrements, with both a meat and a vegetarian option available.  They also serve beef and shrimp among their proteins (besides chicken and lamb) which are not as frequently seen at Indian restaurants so that provided some more variety in options as well. Also, it's helpful to know that the restaurant is BYOB."}
{"text":"Two stars simply because the delivery came quickly and the naan was good.   The lamb curry more tomato-y than I would have liked, and gave me terrible stomach issues that kept me up all night long. I wouldn't try this place again if you paid me."}
{"text":"This is my second time getting food from this place. The first time was phenomenal and top notch. The Flavors were really on point.  Now I just had a delivery today and it was disappointing. The flavor was weak.I ordered the channa mushroom, it hardly had any mushrooms. Since it was so great the first time I'd be willing to try their food again but maybe not as a delivery."}
{"text":"I will admit. Before I met my wife four years ago I never had Indian and now I whenever my wife doesn't want to cook I order from People's. It is always enough to feed me, my wife, our two year old and we never spend over $25!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing how great people's is from friends, so decided to check them out. I went for the lunch buffet. I arrived around 1pm when it ends at 2:30pm. There was still fresh food on the buffet. They refilled while I was there. As a vegan I appreciate Indian food & had many options. Usually my gauge for any Indian place it the Chana masala, my favorite dish. I was super impressed with theirs. Perfectly steamed  chickpeas with right amount of spice & cilantro! A second favorite was the Aloo Pang which is spinach potatoes & spices. The nan was fresh & hot. Also, the service was great, I never once had to ask for water.   For my second experience with people's I decided to order take out. They do free delivery to the surrounding area! (I live in Stanton Heights) it came within an hour of calling & was freshly made. I had no complaints. I order Chana Masala, Aloo pang & nan....it was about $20, lasted me dinner & lunch the next day ! Plan to Order again soon"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery a few times and my favorite is spicy10lamb curry spicy and juicy! I got garlic naan and samosas they are all good except for the mixed grill entree all the stuffs got soggy and did taste weird"}
{"text":"The food here is great. I ordered a vegetarian curry meal at a spice level 7 and it was exactly what I had anticipated. The naan was fresh and perfect to dip in my left over sauces. I have zero complaints and I will return again soon."}
{"text":"Terrible.   At this very moment I am currently cursing my People's Indian Restaurant's lunch. I ordered it with a a friend at work and while the ordering process was fairly simple (grub-hub) and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time the quality of the meal was seriously below standard.   I love Indian food and one thing I love about it is the complexity of the flavors. This was flat, one note. A earlier review mentioned his tikka masala reminiscent of Campbells tomato soup - well add the butter chicken to that experience.   The chicken had that metallic like taste you get from microwaved meat which did compliment the bland taste of the food - hey, if nothing, they are consistent in how awful the meal was prepared.   Right now, I am sitting at my desk and my body is actively fighting indigestion. Yep, this place is terrible. 4 star average? Wow, that is shocking... of the countless Indian meals I have had this is by far the worst.  Update: 8 hours later and still feel sick from this meal. Ugh. Never again."}
{"text":"While staying in Pittsburgh for work, I ordered from here for delivery.  The food was great, the delivery guy was incredibly friendly, and the food arrived in a timely fashion....(during a crazy snow storm, none the less).  I'll definitely eat/order from here again!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I have never eaten in house, only via take out. People's Indian has been the most consistent take out I have ever had.  Their food is always hot and tasty, exactly what I ordered, and very fresh.  I have never had a poor experience while ordering from People's.   Their chicken tikka is very good.  I'm not a huge fan of spice, but my husband goes for a 20/10, and they can accommodate both of our pallets' beautifully.  If you're in the mood for tasty Indian take out, I can't recommend People's enough!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for dinner last night. I had been to the lunch buffet and it has always been alright. However, the dinner experience was wonderful.  We both got combo meals, he the chicken curry and I the fish curry. The fish in the curry was salmon, which was a little unusual and not quite as good as other fish you could curry, but I was also made aware of that when I ordered. For the price we both left very full. The waitstaff was very helpful. When I ordered a \"10\" on the spicy scale, he asked if I wanted \"American 10\" or \"Indian 10\". After finding out that \"American 10\" = \"Indian 5\", I was steered toward the \"Indian 7\" which really was perfect for me. (In previous trips, we had both thought the food a touch mild, but knowing there was an Indian heat scale fixed that problem right off).  It was a wonderful dinner, and I can't wait for our next trip!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I have not been here in years and after my dinner I am now wondering what kept me away for so long. This is a little place so it is intimate and fun. You can just hang out with some friends enjoy the great food. I like going during the lunch time buffet but we were there for dinner so I was not able to sample as much of the dishes as I would have liked. Still we did pretty good.   Appetizers:  Paneer Pakora: Homemade cheese chunks deep fried. Of course this is my go to appetizer at any Indian restaurant. I will say that here I did not get as many of the pakora chunks as some of the other places I have ordered this from, but still they were good.   2 piece Vegetable Samosa: I think that the name suggests it all. There were two crispy turnovers filled with potatoes and peas. Yum. Just the right size. The three of us were able to eat these and they filled us up really nicely.   Vegetable Pakora: Fritters stuffed with vegetables. These were fantastic. Fried perfection. The sauce that it came with was also really good. I enjoyed these more than my favorite dish of the paneer pakora. YUM. Would get this again if I had to pick only one appy.   Main dish:   Ok, I am a little bit of a glutton but I like a good deal. I am trying to find on their online menu what the dish that I ordered was called but I cannot find it listed at all. It is the best deal on the entire menu. You get a chicken or a lamb curry dish, a yogurt dish, a pickle dish, a piece of tandoori chicken, a dessert, and some naan. OH WAIT. You also get a cup of chai tea. It is the best deal on the menu. You can also get this in a veggie dish so you do not have to get meat. It is about the same price as just the curry. Why would you not just for a few dollars more get this with all the extras!!  I liked it here. I had a great time and the food was wonderful. I suggest coming here for a nice dinner or lunch alone or with friends."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is the best deal in town. Its such a good price ($10) for authentic and delicious Indian cuisine. The chicken tikka masala and chicken curry were my favorites. Also the garlic naan was so fresh and perfect with the meal. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet on Saturday is great hangover food.  it is cheap, hot, refreshed often, and has the standard selection.  I love going here."}
{"text":"I have only gone to People's two times, and only for the lunch buffet, but I have to say that both times were pleasant.  People's is a small 'family' Indian restaurant, with a LOT of tables, and the last time I went, a LOT of people filling those seats.  As with most Indian lunch buffets, the offerings are basic and of a very low spice level - but tasty in their 'homogenized' way. It's VERY inexpensive, and worth the all-you-can-eat.  They offer several meat and non-meat choices, plenty of sides, rice, nan, salads, chutneys - and even a pretty yummy hot chai tea that is very creamy and sweet.  The service is pleasant, and the atmosphere is comfortable.  Although when they're really busy, you may be forced to make a new friend at the next table, which really is pretty much the same as them sitting at YOUR table.  The crowd was interesting as well, students en masse, single diners, and pairs - all seeming a little more on the intellectual end of the scale than one might normally see in da burgh.  My only disappointment was the palak paneer which had potato instead of the cheese...although I may have just read the sign wrong, and it wasn't really palak paneer.  The chicken dish was absolutely delicious, and the samosa were yummy.  Can't do Indian food without a big ol' samosa with the green mint chutney sauce.  Generally, nothing uber-fancy, but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This is a nice, small, traditional Indian restaurant with a quaint and quiet atmosphere. Every time I've gotten food here, it has been consistently delicious. Perhaps not the best Indian food I've ever had, but certainly in my top 3 in Pittsburgh.  They have a great number of vegetarian offerings, and the curries are flavorful, thick, and spicy. I also like that they offer a combination platter - which, realistically, is almost too much food for one person.  Service is quite fast - if I'm dining alone I can get in and out in under 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"People's Indian is a solid traditional Indian place. Offerings are standard, but well done. I like their bindi masala and vegetable korma. In meat offerings, their lamb is really quite good.  Their lunch buffet has a solid selection of both meat and vegetable dishes and includes samosas, which not all buffets do. Also included is chai, which is good (if overly sweet).  In general, it's one of the better local Indian places. The service is also pretty consistent and pleasant (unlike, say, India Garden where the service is consistently horrific)."}
{"text":"Cheap, yummy, and down the street from my house.  Down side?  Anyone?  I won't go in to the particulars--I agree with some of the comments below--I will remind people that it's BYOB (I really think Indian food tastes so much better with a beer) so come prepared.    I would not call it life-alteringly-good Indian, but I've found much of the food to be flavorful and the service has always been friendly, if a bit slow at times.    Decor is typical--seems like a kid-friendly place and good for large groups as well.    Oh, and they're closed on Sundays, for which I'm happy for them, but I have to admit I would probably go more often if I could grab take-out on a cold sunday afternoon. . . (that's a hint if the owners are reading)"}
{"text":"You don't want to identify the familiar taste of your chicken tikka masala to be Campbell's tomato soup... But tell me if it isn't reminiscent?! I ordered our go-to chicken tikka masala and saag paneer most recently. Again, I was disappointed by the meat dish. And my saag wasn't much better. It was pretty lacking in the flavor department too...  From past experience, I'd say the vegetarian dishes are  better bets at People's vs meat."}
{"text":"People's is one of the most authentic restaurants in the city for Indian cuisine. Their menu boasts everything from vegetable samosas to chicken tikki marsala, beef curry and more. Excellent seafood and vegetarian selections as well as drinks (love the mango shake) and several other entrees and apps. Business is always booming with take away and guests in the dining room. It's a no-brainer as to why they're a staple on Penn Avenue and why they're so successful. The food is always on point and always delicious; rice and naan cooked to perfection. There's nothing fancy about the restaurant but it's cozy and comfortable. It's like eating dinner in the home of a friend or family member."}
{"text":"I heart this place. It's my favorite Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh, most likely because I have never ever had a bad meal there in the many many many years I've gone since my early post college days. I don't get there much often now since I'm not close to that neighborhood, but taking advantage of a recent event in the same neighborhood, stopped by for dinner and was so so happy to clock in another great meal there with vows to return asap."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken masala, pakora chat and aloo chat for delivery. The food came a half hour sooner than expected, so how come both chats felt like they had just been scooped out of a vat in the fridge and never heated up? They both looked old and one of them smelled old.  I decided to eat the chicken masala first since it was the only thing warm, and it was so bland, and unappealing that I decided I had to heat up the other 2 dishes to try and make up for it. Both of these dishes were extremely unappealing as well. I sadly had to throw most of it away. I always order indian food requesting a low spice number, but that has never accounted for loss of taste like this. I didn't even know you could go wrong with chicken marsala! I can easily say this is the worst indian food I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in the Pgh area considering quality AND cost, as prices are very reasonable compared to others in the area. Lamb Rogan Josh is my go-to. Owners and staff are very kind and consistent. Only down-side for me is the restaurant's size; it can get pretty crowded/uncomfortable dining during lunch, somewhat understandably so since it is well known and highly rated."}
{"text":"Its good food! But being an Indian, I feel there is a lot of potential for improvement. I quite enjoyed the mango lassi though! Its worth a try and then decide if the food works for you."}
