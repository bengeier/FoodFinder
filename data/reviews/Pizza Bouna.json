{"text":"I ordered first time tonight online. Ordered 2 orders of mozzarella sticks and the xl pizza wing combo. I configured my two toppings on the pizza and when I went to configure the wings, it gave me the option of original or boneless with sauce on or on the side. I chose boneless with sauce on the side. Order arrived with 3 pizza boxes and a pack of wings. I asked the driver. He said they are mozzarella sticks. I opened the boxes and there are no mozzarella sticks. Its cheese pizza cut in strips with a little tub of marinara. Their menu had pics of breaded deep-fried mozzarella sticks. I open the wings and they are bone in with sauce all over. Called to complain and they told me the  special does not come with boneless. I told him that their website specifically gave me the choice. They argued. They also said they made what they think are mozzarella sticks. Unbelievable. Worst $40 I ever spent."}
