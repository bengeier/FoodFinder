{"text":"Delicious!  Had the chorizo burrito and it was so good!  Tasted husband's Hawaiian asada burrito and it was equally delicious. Warning, the burritos are huge. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not the best location, glad I had my concealed firearm, but I can work with that if the rest is good.  The strip mall had a security guard that circulated constantly.  Restuarant not particularly clean.  Super nachos heating was inconsistent.  Food was bland, sour cream and cheese a bit strange in appearance. Biggest concern was the lack of any posted health license which suggests either they are not licensed or lack an A rating. My apologies if I missed it. Someone please point out the location."}
{"text":"The food is good and filling. The flavors are unique and delicious. The atmosphere has the authentic Mexican food feel which is nice since most vegan places seem trendy, so this was a nice change. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Just evaluating on the basis as a mexican food, I have had none better in Las Vegas.  I was born and raised on Mexican food, the rellano is the benchmark for me theirs are wonderful.  Chips and salsa were excellent as well all very reasonable priced.  So forget the fact that its vegan it is good food plain and simple."}
{"text":"This pains me to leave this review as 2 stars but I have to be open and honest.  I saw on social media that Veganos was opening and was pretty excited about a vegan place opening off Rancho/Cheyenne. I was promised (after asking) via social media that is was not connected to a vegan taco shop on the East side that I despise...so we went.   We went having an open mind that the photos looked EXACTLY like the other place, with almost EXACTLY the same menu, yet hoped it would be better...it was not.  Pretty rough area hubs was hesitant to park the car, the car is not a RR but it's nice. We walked in a saw a nice family eating and a woman in the back.   The cashier was super timid and just stood there. When she spoke it was sooooo quiet you can hardly hear her. Not sure if she is miserable or just a quiet person. We order a bunch of food and two hibiscus teas.  We sat and the table was dirty, crumbs and so I wiped them away with the only thing on the table, a paper menu.   Our drinks came and they were gross. I was super sad I just didn't order a bottle of water. I was hungry and thirsty and this hibiscus tasted exactly like ultra sweet koolaide. I tried to drink it again and just couldn't.  Chkn taco place came and it had beans and rice. Looked sooooo yummy I was excited! Cheat day starting! I kinda actually liked the chikn in the tacos, it had a sauce, but of course it processed faux so I'm surprised I even ate it. The rice tasted like globs of spiced tomato sauce oily rice and the beans were sooooo bland they were border like opening a can and adding salt. They were just boiled pinto beans.   The breakfast burrito was uncooked mushy tofu (at least add some Kala Namak and turmeric!) a hella ton of canned mushy jalapeño and some white onion that was barely sautéed...  The nachos were ok but since asking for no Daiya (and getting some on it anyway) they were also salty and bland. The ascada was horrible, it was vegan Tofurkey sausage links cut up and tossed on the top. Dry and chunky. There were a few plops of guacamole which tasted great and thankfully some cilantro to give something some type of flavor. The chips are the top shelf Cardenas type of chip the triple fried ones...super crispy...super fried.   Hubs and I were really hungry and tried to eat the \"food\" anyway. All I could think of was wow can't wait for this conversation in the car.......  We got in the car and we both agreed we would have rather just went to Taco Bell for the first time in ten years and saved the $35.  I was right...it's just like Panchos Vegan Tacos. Poor quality, wasted calorie vegan junk food. Very sad because it could be soooooooo good!!!!!!  If you look at my photos it looks GREAT right? It's not. I have an extreme sodium headache and it's bland af.  Save your money and go to Panchos Kitchen on Charleston. You will thank me later.   :("}
{"text":"After our first time at Veganos, we really enjoyed it! The Beyond Burger is great, the aioli was delicious and it didn't even need the extra ketchup and mustard they put on the sides. Fries were standard but good. The Chile relleno was tasty but the sauce was too spicy for us. The spice overpowered the flavor. And of course it'd be better with a different cheese, I'm not a fan of Daiya. The al pastor burrito was good but I wish there was more al pastor and less filler in the burrito. It was a little unbalanced. The rice and beans are out of this world! I could just get them and be thrilled.   Veganos is one of the only options in this part of town and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and superb customer service. I was staying in Vegas when I was told about a vegan restaurant by local who I was staying with. I conversed in Spanish with someone that works there several time. It was great. The food didn't disappoint. I will be returning the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"WOW! I read the previous reviews and it's true, this little restaurant is a gem and I am so happy to have them in my town.  I ordered the Chile Relleno and the Pozole. The Chile Relleno was superb and very flavorful, it came with rice and beans. The rice was good and the beans delicious. I would have loved two Chile Rellenos . The sauce was very tasty and in my opinion, this is a must try.   The Pozole with Vegan Asada meat as my choice of meat was really good. It reminded me of the Pozole I am used to having at Birthday parties or at weddings. I am not Vegan and it was a pleasant surprise to discover how good the Pozole was without the tons of pork it usually comes with.  I tasted it on its own and it was tasty. After that, I just dumped all the garnish and lime in. Delicious!  I am so glad I came here and would love to encourage you to try them. It's fantastic to have this type of business in town and I hope they flourish. It can only encourage a trend and elevate our choices."}
{"text":"Second time here and still love the food! Tried the Chile relleno it is so good!! Great for lunch"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  We had he Chilaquiles and a chicken burrito and they were both incredible.  Traditional Mexican flavors prepared in a healthy Vegan fashion.  The owner and his wife were very friendly and the price was right.  If you're looking for some great Mexican Food the Way Mexican Food should be made Veganos is a must visit."}
{"text":"Great vegan breakfast options as they have two different style burritos. I had the chorizo burrito which was very good sized for the price. Will definitely be back here.  Jose the owner is very personable."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and it was good. But their it prices are high for quality of food. It not really worth the high spend. 10 dollar average for each plate. Unless you getting single items. Burger is the best we tried. I would of given more stars but they need to earn them. The staff was delightful. Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 or 4 times now and it is by far the best vegan \"authentic Mexican\" restaurant in town (and probably outside of town as well).   My favorite menu item is the pozole with chicken, since it's pretty much impossible to find vegan pozole outside of your own kitchen. The chicken burrito is very good as well.   I recommend 'chicken' as choice of meat. The carne asada is okay as well.  I personally do not find the \"Hawaiian pastor\" flavor appealing.  They use Daiya sparingly enough (at least in the burrito) to not detract from the overall quality (I am not a fan of Daiya). I assume it is used more liberally in the quesadillas, etc.   It's nice to have another vegan option in this part of town (Rancho/Cheyenne isn't exactly known for quality food of any sort), and well worth the drive if you aren't nearby.  The value here is also very good, with extremely affordable prices and filling portions."}
{"text":"It was good, I didn't order anything new that I haven't tried somewhere else. Very clean and food didn't take too long to make. Very nice people working here, would come again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day after seeing some posts on a social media page I follow. It's not close to home but I was in the area (volunteered at Shade Tree) and decided to check out Veganos since it was a few miles from Shade Tree.  The menu is a bit small and I had a hard time deciding. I asked for a recommendation and the cashier suggested nachos. I ordered it with asada. The nachos came out fairly quickly. First sad face is because the cheese was cold, flavorless, and not melted at all. The \"asada\" was more of a cut up sausage. The other toppings were also not very exciting.  I've had some pretty amazing vegan nachos at other eateries so there's no excuse for some sad ones...and these were sad.  Service was okay.  They could use some cleaning. The floors were dirty and sticky with spilled drinks or sauces all over...needed a mopping pretty badly.  The bathroom was dirty as well.  It was an okay meal- but not a good one. Definitely not a great one.  Wouldn't recommend nor will I return."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find an authentic Mexican restaurant in Vegas! Staff is so friendly! My bf and I ordered Sopes! They were really good!"}
{"text":"Al Pastor is a must! The Owner is a great man and was very friendly. The rice and beans had flavor and just right. We had the tacos and sopes. I was left very impressed that it taste just as good as meat."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's cheap and delicious. I love the sopes, it's a great lunch spot, or for to go!"}
{"text":"Best Vegan authentic Mexican food we've had! Best vegan chili relleno. My son's had the Chorizo super fries, and western asada burrito. 100% vegan..Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We happened to be in the area and we decided to stop for breakfast. It was a great decicion. The food was amazing. I had the Mexican style burrito and my husband had the chorizo burrito. They were both amazing! We live in Henderson and we are definitely coming back again to try more of their food. Definitely recommend this place to vegans and non vegans"}
{"text":"The food was cold and seemed as if they didn't care how they prepared it. I felt like throwing up after a few hours of consuming the hamburger. Wouldn't come back or recommend it. I made better vegan food than these guys."}
{"text":"Well, what I got here was good. But we all know that Mexican food is the cheapest on earth to make so that left me disappointed that the portions were so small. I got the tiniest amount of beans and rice. And a sample size at best of my entree. I'll be back I just wished the portions matched what they are charging."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE HAS AMAZING FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!! Highly recommend to my fellow vegan peeps! You won't be upset."}
{"text":"This place was truly great. The Chile relleno and burger/ fries were some of the best vegan food I've had in Vegas. Sure the environment is not fancy but it's clean and friendly. I will be returning whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Veganos is okay. About what you would expect for the area it is in.  I had hoped the menu would provide a little more selection   The food was average.   Regardless, I am happy to see another vegan restaurant pop up. Hopefully they can fine tune their food"}
{"text":"Veganos has excellent tacos and they are very consistent with the taste and the flavors.   One of the main hotspots for  whenever I am feening tacos.   The wait is only around 10 min depending on what you order.   They are very generous and  never rude. An Excellent place to Eat!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Convenient parking.  Amazing food!  My hunny and I split an Asada burrito and a pastor burrito.  It comes with a small side of freshly made tortilla chips, and a green and red salsa each.  I hope to see more people there soon.  Many choices to choose from and we will definately be back."}
{"text":"The food is genuinely delicious. My go-to's are the sopes, super fries, and the Beyond burger with bacon and cheese. I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I am at Veganos now deciding what to put in my review. I've been plant-based over 20 years and vegan takeout is hard to find. some has been very bad. Veganos works for me. when i want good culture food, the Best is always found within its own \"ethnic enclave\"....or neighborhood. So I drove to this location. First of all...they are NOT mexican. Guatemalan. different food style. But, while I would like more spicy smothered in sauce, their Burrito was tasty. next time i will ask for more sauce. Place was clean and service timely. They opened 6 months ago, give them support."}
{"text":"The chicken nachos were not bad. I almost wish I would have taken a picture of them to share it but honestly, by the time I got them I was so hungry that taking a picture went out the window. Anyhow, I'm rating my overall experience a 3 star experience because of their customer service. I placed my order over the phone for pick up and was told it would be ready in 10 min. I will admit, I got there about 4-5 min past that but the problem was that my order never even made it to the kitchen. Maybe it's just my bad luck but I hope this doesn't happen to others. I was so disappointed but ultimately, the nachos were not good enough to make up for their error. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good food very filling and at a decent price. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody whether you're vegan or not"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican Vegan food I have had yet! The loaded vegan french fries were amazing and I could not even tell the chorizo was not real pork. The food tasted clean since I dislike the meaty taste in real meat. I was satisfied and the chorizo tacos were very good. I cannot wait to try more off of the menu! The staff was also very friendly and helped explain the menu since I was new."}
{"text":"Great service and TASTY food,This place does not get enough credit I didn't even know that this place existed until I was at the McDonald's across the street with my family I don't live around here and I love this place I'm gonna be coming here a lot more often"}
{"text":"Love the vegan menu options and friendly customer service! Gluten free options are available too.  Will be returning to try more of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Wow, I am not a vegetarian but the pozole soup and Al Pastor tacos were excellent. Looking forward to coming back and try other   Excellent taco Tuesday specials!!"}
{"text":"Veganos, was an unexpected surprise while we were out shopping!  The food, and extras are all 100% Vegan.  The food is not rushed, each order is given individual \"made to order\" care!  Veganos was a welcome relief for someone who has grown tired of picking through menus to find something to eat! Great staff and very clean!"}
{"text":"I visited Veganos Kitchen for the first time in Memorial Day and I ordered the Chorizo breakfast burrito. It's a huge burrito, 1lb to be exact, and comes at a decent price of 6.99 with freshly fried tortilla chips and two salsas in the side (verde & chipotle).  I added grilled onions to it, even though I probably should've added peppers to bring it some more flair.  It was a good burrito, but I couldn't really tell there was vegan chorizo inside because of the abundance of tofu.  The seasoning was great, not too salty, and maybe the chorizo they use added to that flavor.    The burrito had just the right amount of greasiness, reminiscent of a traditional Mexican burrito/taco stand. I would have loved more avocado in the burrito and salsa verde on the side. The chipotle salsa tasted watered down and didn't have much flavor, so I didn't bother using it.  I couldn't taste or tell there was sour cream or cheese in the burrito so that's a bit of a drawback.  I'm giving 4 stars because overall it was a good burrito, I received my food very quickly and I had a good conversation with the owner about the establishment."}
{"text":"Realizing I didn't post a review. I ate here a few weeks ago. It was a great find on the Northwest side. I love Mexican food and was happy it was right around the corner from my house. Very fresh and good!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We come here about once a week and it's always delicious. This time, we wanted a burger and theirs is so good! I added the guacamole and it comes with a yummy special sauce. Recommended for anyone to come and eat here for Mexican food or burgers."}
{"text":"I just tried this place tonight and I really enjoyed it. I'm Vegan and really appreciate new Vegan places popping up. I was very hungry and it all tasted wonderful to me, to be honest. I had the super fries and an asada quesadilla. It was so good! I was one happy woman. There was even a woman who came in to order and didn't know it was Vegan but after we all explained it to her, she decided to take a chance and she loved it! She was saying how happy she was that she stayed and said she'd be back. I told her to Go Vegan! It was a nice and pleasant experience. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 is because I think they could do better on the atmosphere. The lights are pretty bright and it would be nicer if they turned them a bit more dim and maybe had some nice music instead of a TV. Those are just some suggestions but the food was amazing to me!"}
{"text":"This place has a very simple yet diverse menu. A tad unorganized but super friendly. I got the hibiscus and pineapple agua freca mixed she was skeptical to give it to me but I knew it would be flame."}
{"text":"Wow! Almost everything is made from scratch and delicious! Jose the owner is very friendly, he was happy to share some of the evolution of the menu and why he went 100% Vegan. He believes the future holds vegan restaurants to become the majority of food choices one day. I had the lunch special for $5!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were looking for something to eat and this place came up first and let me tell you! This places food is so close to the real thing and its good for you. I am not going to say much, just give this place a try and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"If you've been looking for an awesome vegan Mexican food place like I have, Veganos is your  place! They have a nice variety of meat substitutes. The carne asada fries/nachos are So Good!  (I do wish they used a different vegan cheese and not Dayia)"}
{"text":"I'm not Vegan and I enjoyed their Hawaiian pastor sopes! If you are not Vegan don't go in there thinking the vegan meat will taste like actual meat because it doesn't. It has a very different consistency.  The overall taste was good, not great but good. The food could use more seasonings. There was no salt on the tables. The salsa is very mild but for a lot of people that's a good thing (that's why the 4 stars instead of 5). The place is a small hole in the wall where you order at the register first and then sit. The wait wasn't too long considering there were two others ahead of me. They are worth the try for those meat eaters who are trying to be healthy or keeping an open mind to Vegan foods. For anyone who normally has a weak stomach for Mexican food or spicy, don't worry, this place is for you! Very mild seasonings and really no spiciness at all. Very healthy tasting! Great prices! Can't beat that. The people seem nice enough although there was very little interaction.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Western tacos were excellent! I'm a new vegetarian and still trying to find good options for myself. Veganos hit the spot."}
{"text":"First time trying out this spot. Delicious! Come support your local vegan restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our second time here. First we got the Beyond burger. Comes with fries and a drink. Super delish! Also the 3 potato tacos with rice and beans and a drink. We had mango agua fresca. It was all delicious! Now we're trying the posole and chik'end quesadilla. Customer service is super friendly here. We will be back many times!"}
{"text":"It's alright. Could use a little more flavor. They do have specials on certain days which I really like!"}
{"text":"First time I've checked out this vegan shop, but it's solid! Definitely the best vegan tacos I've had in Vegas by far. Can't wait to stop by again to try their burger."}
{"text":"The best vegan carne asada fries I've ever had. I've been looking for a good replacement to my robertos since going vegan and this place is so good. I've driven across town twice already just to get these. New favorite spot."}
{"text":"So happy to see vegan places in this area! Food was awesome as well as the service! They had something here for everyone and everything we ordered tasted amazing. This will definitely be one of our regular places to eat out."}
{"text":"Veganos is an extremely convenient, quick and totally vegan spot recently opened further north in LV.   Stopped in this afternoon for some asada tacos (sides of course) & potato tacos! Both had a spicy kick but equally delicious! My gripe was the excessive black pepper on the tacos. Edible but not my seasoning preference.  The gentlemen who assisted me was polite and accommodating so I'll definitely be back for round two!"}
{"text":"We had the super fries with chorizo and the burrito, hawaiian style. Fries were super amazing. They have great portion size!"}
{"text":"Great \"Beyond Meat\" burger!   It was the first time I've had one, and wow...    I'm eager to come back here & try some of the other menu items -- I feel kind of foolish going to what is a (vegan) Mexican restaurant & ordering a (vegan) cheeseburger, but I've been hearing about the \"Beyond Meat\" vegan burger patties for a while, & was anxious to try one.  The place is in a rather dirty little strip mall that has a Savers grocery store & 99 Cent store -- look for them as you're on Rancho Drive & pull-in to that shopping center.    The restaurant is on the other end from those stores, in-between a laundromat & a check-cashing store (which makes for interesting people-watching).   I was there for about an hour, with no other customers.   In terms of area demographics, I do worry about the viability of a vegan restaurant at this location -- it's going to need us happy customers promoting it.   Though it's pretty far away from the areas I frequent, I'll be back, and am eager to take friends there so they can give it a try & help spread the word."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, as vegan options in the valley are few and far between.  But you couldn't pay me to eat here if it was the last vegan restaurant on the planet.  Tried the sopes, the flavor was alright but whatever product they use for the meat -tofu or seitan I'm assuming- wasn't properly dried so it made the meal watery.   Also, curse on anyone that uses Daiya cheese. That stuff is gross, please get an alternative."}
{"text":"Ordered the 3 taco plate with rice & beans. Rice & beans were great. The tacos were awesome. My favorite was chorizo followed by al pastor. Staff is great & very nice. Happy there's a vegan place on the north side. Also, they have Jarritos!!!!!"}
{"text":"Veganos is an amazing spot for delicious, vegan, Mexican food. Their sopes are especially good and I'd recommend anyone going here for the first time to try them!  There's ample parking in the strip mall. While the space inside is a little limited, it offers a few tables you can eat at.  The food is come to order and all great quality.  Definitely recommend to anyone, not just vegans!"}
{"text":"It was so refreshing to see a vegan restaurant in 'the hood.' Usually, healthy dining options are exclusively found in more affluent neighborhoods. The owner, Jose, is from Guadalajara and very personable.   Upon placing my to go order, I was told it would take approximately 15 minutes. Thirty minutes later, I received my order of asada tacos, chile relleno, and super fries.   The taco plate included three asada tacos, Spanish rice, pinto beans, and a soft drink. My husband said they were slightly on the dry side, and the taste was just okay.   The super fries looked better than they tasted. A little more salt, sour cream, guacamole and cheese would totally take it up a notch.    Lastly, the chile relleno was grilled instead of deep fried. I'm sure it's much healthier this way, but I prefer the traditional way. They were kind of skimpy on the cheese, but made up it with ample sauce. My husband and I could not get enough of the Spanish rice. I personally like to mix it in with the beans. Now that's good eatin'!"}
{"text":"Authentic Vegan Mexican food... totally worth the drive. This little hole-in-the-wall resturaunt is located in Centennial. The staff is friendly and the food is wonderful!  We ordered a mango agua fresca, pozole, asada fries and an asada burrito. Everything is made to order, so we had to wait a bit--but it was worth it! The asada fries were so rich and savory! I ate every bite. The pozole was on point!--totally authentic, reminded me of traditional posole from Mexico. Yummy! My boyfriend loved the asada burrito. He said it was \"true to it's carnivore counterpart\" meaning, you couldn't tell it was vegan. My brother and sister-in-law loved their tostadas and sopas. I'm pretty sure we all licked our plates clean (just kidding!)!  The resturaunt is small, but cute. The painted walls reminded me of Mexican decor. The bathroom was very clean and well-stocked. The cashier/server was very nice and accommoting to our table.   I have already recommended Veganos to many people. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"GREAT VEGAN HOLE-IN-THE-WALL!  To the person saying the chicken and meat aren't convincing, ITS VEGAN, what do you expect? we take what we can, of course it wont taste like the real thing. To the person saying the floor is sticky and stuff, this is a neighborhood vegan joint, if you want gourmet fine dining go somewhere else. Having said that, service was good and food was even better! The sopes were delicious  and so were the super fries. Best of all, it didn't cost an arm and a leg like other \"fast food\" vegan places."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Mexican food? Really? That person should move in a desert full of rattle snakes and count the days of his/her remaining life. How about a vegan Mexican food in the middle of the desert just North of Vegas? Then I'll voluntarily move myself in a heartbeat.   Go see Jose and ask for a chicken style burrito. It was big with beans, lettuce, vegan Daya cheese, delicious slices of chicken tofu, a side of tortilla chips, green and red salsa.  The taste was very authentic. The place unassuming. And most importantly, the service was superb. Until next time, Jose. We enjoyed our meal, thank you."}
{"text":"When I say this is the good good... it's THEEEEE good good. Best Mexican food I've ever had.  Had the vegan asada sopes and now I cannot go back to regular sopes every again after trying Veganos. I literally mowed through my food. No survivors left on my plate.  Chips were crunchy and greasy. Guac was fresh and paired well with the salsa verde. I could taste the love in the beans because those beans were unholy.  Pls never close. I need you."}
{"text":"Really good food... wish the salsa bar had been open but even without it was super yummy and has a great selection. Would have been 5 star with great salsa or homemade tortillas. Service was a little slow but friendly. Excited they opened up in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We loved the food on our first visit tonight.  It was tasty, good portion size and affordable.  We will definitely go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and i definitely will be coming back! I got the quesadilla, western style (vegan asada meat, mushrooms, and onions) and my non vegan mother loved it... that's how good it was. The cheese was stretchy just like dairy cheese would be! The man at the register, who I think was the owner, was extremely friendly as well. It's a bit far from my house but the quality of the food and the customer service makes it worth the drive"}
{"text":"Went with my non vegan mother and aunt,and we all had a great lunch.    The chorizo breakfast tasted terrific and was huge. Good amount of spice. A bit on the greasy side and I'd suggest adding some green like spinach.  We also had a quesadilla which was basically melted diaya but still good. Chili relleno, i didn't try,  but looked delicious and heard it had a good kick.  Last we're the tacos asada which were also very good, a tad over priced compared to the burrito    Food was a bit slow to come out but was very hot and fresh when it did. Would like to all have real plates and not paper (ones for some dishes).  Will be back on future visits to Las Vegas. Hoping they expand the menu and add more things like spiced potato's as an option and more veggies."}
{"text":"Super flavorful authentic Mexican food that has been veganized!  The owner is down to earth, friendly, and great customer service.  Food only took about ten minutes to come out.  Had the western Asada Sopas.  Sooo good and the rice and beans that came worth were flavorful as well.  My daughter had the chicken style quesadilla which was basically as sounds but she enjoyed it.   Will be back to try more stuff.. very affordable also."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. The chicken burrito was very good. This is located in North Las Vegas glad I was on this side of town today and got to check it out."}
{"text":"I'm happy to see more Vegan options pop up!   But... I really hope they change their meats.  I got something with each so I can taste them all.  Their Chicken is the same as the Asada? It doesn't have a similar texture to either; its more of a ground sausage. And their Pastor tastes like pure pineapple and nothing else.  Although, once you add salsa, it's all good.  In all honesty, salsa's great and all, but it shouldn't be necessary.  It could be BETTER.   I'll be back to see what's up"}
{"text":"Please do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Very unprofessional got my order wrong multiple times. The \"manager\" told me to leave and dont come back because my order was complicated. Order; Chorizo burrito, grilled onions, beans and sour cream. Wooowww soooooo hard."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the food was Great. I like the fact that they had a non-soy meat alternative. I had the taco plate.The homemade beans are delicious. I recommend that they double up on the corn tortilla for the street tacos and increase portion size for rice and beans otherwise I would have given it five stars . My friend is allergic to extremely spicy food. Yet,  she was able to eat the taco plate with the non-soy meat alternative. They have great red and green sauce available for those who like spicy like myself.  \"Eat with Gratitude \" Mikhael"}
