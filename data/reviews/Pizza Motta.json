{"text":"On y est allé pour manger un repas en famille et cela tombait bien, car c'était le mercredi, menu pizza à volonté.Le service était rapide et la madame était souriante, mais la qualité de la nourriture déplorable.La salade dégoulinait de graisse et j'y ai même trouvé un poil. Les pâtes sans aucune saveur.Le pizza( différentes sortes) moyenne.Je ne comprends pas pourquoi on le considère comme un des 10 pizzerias à visiter à Montréal.En plus, ils n'avaient même pas de chaise haute pour bébé.La personne qui devait ramasser les assiettes ne s'est jamais venue à notre table.On est vite parti prendre notre dessert et le café ailleurs."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price.  Eat in or take away.  The choices are near limitless and the staff are friendly.  Small cafe in front and a larger dining room in back makes Motta one of the easiest/most comfortable Italian eateries in town.  And don't miss out on the desserts - check the 'sale' fridge for half price cakes and cannoli."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit pour des mets Italien a emporter Le service n est pas des plus souriant mais il est rapide et efficace Il vous réchauffe vos plats à votre demande Les mets sont délicieux"}
{"text":"I used to come here years ago and it was pretty good.  But i was very disappointed this  time as their food consisted of gooey sauces (probab. Adding lots of starch to thicken instead of real cream or butter . )I ordered rolled eggplant  dish but there was no eggplant in there! Only a paper thin slice that was coveted and  lost in  tons of soggy breading.  My friend's veal dish wad not very fresh ! All dishes are zapped for u in the microwave:-//   Sorry to see some other great spot go down south!"}
{"text":"Plein de saveurs à goutter!  ça va de la vente de charcuterie, à la fabrication de pâtisserie, au service de plats froids et chauds tels que des salades ou encore du poisson/viande marinés, assaissonnés différemment. On peut même manger sur place et sachez que les vendredis soirs, c'est.... pizza à volonté! Si, si!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food! There is a dessert counter and food counter where you can choose a single item or a mixed plate to stay or go. I chose a mixed plate with a meatball, pasta best, and roasted veggies. It was hard to decide what to get, everything looked so good! The meatball was delicious but slightly salty, and the pasta and sauce were great. I wish the pasta was made fresh, but it isn't. The mixed plate was around $15, which seemed high. Friendly staff and lots of seating if you need a break from visiting the Marche Jean Talon!"}
{"text":"After going to the Jean Talon Market for years and never knowing about Mota, I was told about it by a family member whose friend had taken them. Ended up having lunch there and taking some of their prepared food home. The food is traditional Italian. Very very good and so reasonably priced. It will now be a regular stop on my market ventures. It's great for people who don't have time to cook all the time. Even though I cook frequently, it's nice to know you can find some real home cooked Italian food and a huge variety at that."}
{"text":"Multibouffe italienne, on retrouve une belle variété d'huiles d'olive, pâtes, fromages, charcuteries, pâtisseries, plats à emporter.   3 étoiles parce que c'est un peu cher"}
{"text":"It's really hit and miss here, I was attracted by their All You Can Eat Pizza Promotion, but once inside there was absolutely nobody eating at the sit-in area.  So we decided for take out instead,cold-cut sandwich was awesome and well priced ($5) I also had a veal parmigiana,re-heated it was very chewy ,did not come with any sides ($7)  Bacon Carbonara pasta ($7) was pretty tasty but a bit on the expensive since i just wanted a side for my veal. Finally the salmon and spaghetti al olio combo dish ($7), well priced but really tasted off.  Overall a pass except for the sandwich, i really wanted all you can eat, but don't wanna be the only table there.  I would appreciate it if all the prices and the items would be clearly labelled at the counter so we know what's what."}
{"text":"This is great pizza. Grab a slice and see for yourself. You'll probably only need one but you'll know by the first bite it was worth it!!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good cafe in the Jean Talon Market area. My friend and I went for their Pizza Combo. It included a quarter of a Pizza, a side salad and a drink. The food was very tasty! The only two things I did not like was service and overall environment. In the beginning, I was confused about their promotion and they were not able to explain it to me properly. The outside of the store, where we ate, was very dirty and no one came to clean up dirty tables and take away dirty plates in half an hour.  I would gladly come back for the food, but this time, I would go for a take-out, lol.  P.S.: The food there was quite affordable. The promotion I mentioned above was only $10.99!"}
{"text":"What's great about Montreal are those moments when you discover new places that have been around for years. Those neighbourhood spots that serve the best home cooked meal a deli could offer. This place will have you wiping the drool from your mouth when you see all the choice of fine Italian dishes. After a day shopping at Jean Talon Market, you can dip into this Italian bakery/deli to enjoy a good lunch with company. Fine dining at reasonable prices adding to the charm of local cuisine."}
{"text":"Du magasinage au marché Jean Talon et un arrêt bouffe chez Motta. Multitude de choix pour manger sur place ou pour emporter, pizzas, pasta, salades, boulettes de viande... Il y en a pour tout les goûts! Staff sympathique et agréable. Ce n'est pas de la grande gastronomie mais ça fait sa job. Pas de service aux tables, il faut commander au comptoir et on attends que ce soit prêt (si éventuellement on mange chaud) on récupère son plateau et on va s'asseoir où on veux. Je n'ai jamais eu l'occasion de gouter les desserts qui ont l'air très appétissants! Il y a aussi de \"l'épicerie\", huiles d'olives, fromages, biscuits... Petite déception à ma dernière visite, mon cheum a commandé des aubergines farcies. La farce était plutôt molle, pas très agréable, et cerise sur le gâteau, il y avait encore l'étiquette autocollante sur l'aubergine!(vous savez cette étiquette qu'il y a sur les fruits et légumes quand vous les achetez...) Un oubli j'imagine, mais c'est pas le fun dans l'assiette. Mais je m'y arrêterais encore très certainement!"}
{"text":"If you want best quality price food, here's the place to come. Quality is great although sometimes you have to wait since it can get crowded. I personally think here's where you can find one of the best cannoli in Mtl.   In my top 10 joints in town."}
{"text":"My review is limited to the patisserie portion of this establishment.  Grabbed a few pastries here before going home  and they were just alright. Pastries need to be good to exceptional. These seem to have been there awhile and while some may state picking up pastries in the evening may be too late to get fresh I'll counter with the point that businesses need to ensure their goods are at their best during all business hours.  At worst provide a discount if they can't certify their freshness. I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Lovely Cafe next to the market! We ordered a cappuccino and two tiramisus! Both desserts was a delight, and were not too sweet, paired with a cup of decent coffee was the perfect afternoon snack.  Absolutely loved it. Service was warm and lovely too!"}
{"text":"Depuis plus de 10 ans, J'y vais surtout pour la pizza à volonté le mercredi/vendredi. Ca inclus salade et pâtes et c'est pas cher. Ou juste prendre un expresso et dessert après les courses au marché.   Nourriture: pizza croute mince excellente, celle à croute épaisse moyen. Les salades, repas déjà preparés: y a beaucoup de choix et c'est bon. Le prix est raisonnable. On y retrouve plusieurs spécialités italiennes et autres: veau parmigianna, osso bucco, salades de pâtes pesto, calmars frits, etc. Beaucoup de produits en rabais pour les petits budgets.   Dessert: beaucoup de choix, pas cher du tout, recette original comme la fusion d'un cannoli et d'un tiramisu. Generalement bon, mais des fois ca semble être ceux de la veils ou le frigo asseche un peu les desserts? Le goût est bon, des fois excellent, mais pas de la haute pastisserie. Y a aussi des produits de boulangerie italienne. Plusieurs desserts en rabais, ca vaut le coup!   Mini section épicerie: beaucoup de choix: pâtes, huile, olives, fromage, viandes, pestos, pâtes congelées, etc.   Service: il y a beaucoup d'employés, donc c'est très rapide. Generalement du bon service.   Ambiance et decor: moi j'aime beaucoup, c'est convivial et chaleureux. Rien de fancy, rien de special, mais fonctionnel et agreable. Il y a une petite terrasse intérieure ou c'est agréable d'y manger ou boire un café.   Rapport qualité/prix: très bien. generalement pas cher et option pour petit budget. Bonne nourriture, rien de fancy.   4 étoiles parce que Motta est sans pretention et que vous en avez pour votre argent."}
{"text":"Nonna pride! My nonna and the cast of Sopranos would be down with Motta. No question. Pizza, boom. Tiramisu, boom. Cannolis, boom. Antipasto bar, coffee, hot table, Italian breads, boom boom boom diggity. Its sweet to hear whispers of Italian too as you drool at the bakery display. Ugh, I wish I could eat without consequence. Damnit!!! The meatballs are the real deal. Crab and shrimp salad is light and a 1 way ticket to Yumtown. I hate myself for using that expression, I'm just excited guys..."}
{"text":"Good food and a lot of variety. We went here for lunch and got veil parm and a giant meatball. One dish had a side of grilled veggies. Both came with pasta. They were both very good. Only reason for the 4 star was that the meatball wasn't heated all the way through. This is one of those places where everything is made and they just stick it in the microwave to warm it up for you.  It was a bit expensive for this kind of place I though at $30 for both meals. I would say it's a $$ more than a $."}
{"text":"Just around a cute corner from the Jean Talon Market, Motta in my opinion is best for taking out prepared dishes to eat back at home on the porch or up the street at the ole picnic hole in Jarry Parc. We like the roast sausages, spicy pizza, chicken and potatoes, the hearts of palm and bocconcini salad, and two of whatever the nice Italian lady behind the counter recommends.   They do use too much terrible-for-the-environment packaging, tons of saran wrap and styrofoam. I wish take-out places would properly tackle this problem. I would consume a lot more if they did, I swear.  At the bakery counter the baguettes and donuts are amazingly fresh and light. The churros were a bit of a fail, but who orders churros at an Italian bakery anyway? My fault really."}
{"text":"Un des bons endroits pour manger sur le pouce. Pizza, pâtes, salades. Commandez au comptoir et choississez une table.  Beaucoup de choix d'aliments frais à emporter dont du pain, des pâtisseries, fromages, etc.  Prix raisonnables. Bon service."}
{"text":"I lived right beside this place earlier in the year, and went there often. Motta is has some great little desserts, and affordable take-away food (pizza trio combo with rapini salad was great for a night in). The pizza itself isn't actually that good in my opinion, but despite the name, I think a lot of people go there for their other foods. It's a good, affordable place to pop into if you need something to bring to a dinner party but didn't have time to prepare anything.   The one thing I found Motta did very poorly was the all you can eat pizza party. We went one night when it wasn't too busy, but they only came around with pizza twice. It was like they'd chosen to ignore us as the waitress disappeared completely, and when we went up to ask what was going on there was just a cold tray of old pizza sitting on the counter. This was our only eat-in experience, so I'm guessing we just went on a bad night. Still, I wouldn't go there on a date night, as the ambiance isn't particularly warm."}
{"text":"Got disappointed because we went there for the occasion of Pizza Fest and they have a bunch of restrictions... Anyway, the staff is not very friendly but we still order something after all. The pizza was average, no surprise at all"}
{"text":"If I lived in this neighborhood, no doubt about it, I'd probably be here all the time either picking up prepared foods to take home of have a slice of pizza right on the premises.  If you're like me and can't cook Italian food the way it deserves to be cooked, you best bet is coming here and picking up a few from their myriad of selection choices, whether it's pastries like cannolis or tiramisu or many types of antipasto if you're entertaining or the prepared pasta sauces, breads, pizzas and tons of other great stuff. I'm surprised that this place doesn't have more reviews given that its been here for years. The service is really friendly, prices are reasonable and the food is stellar. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Bcp de choix !! Repas prets  , chauds pour manger sur place ou apporter, patisserie et fromagerie egalement. Terrasse couverte. Service italien style ..."}
{"text":"Today I went to order pizza and had to wait for them to be prepared...big mistake...I ended up going to the dark side, and now I have a new addiction called Baccio.  This little unassuming chocolate and pistachio ball of flavor seems harmless but do beware! Especially on St Valentines, (baccio means kiss in Italian), could it get any scarier."}
