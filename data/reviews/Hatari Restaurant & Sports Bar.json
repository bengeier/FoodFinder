{"text":"Super clean great drinks management really caters to the customer. Give this place a try on a Friday."}
{"text":"I dont even know where to start, service was bad the bartender ddnt even know there beer selection or the food. We had to switch from glass to plastic just because a event but they allowed us to get bottled beer, what a contradiction right? The owner tried giving us some nonsense about it. I wonder why they get little business. At the start we let the bartender known we wanted splt checks amongst us, there was three of us. Then it took 15 mins to split our checks. I specifly asked the owner for a glass for my beer and they denied it then gave me plastic. It seems like most of the employees there are incompetent of simple tasks"}
{"text":"Stick with the burgers! The chicken picatta needed more sauce, tasted OK, but pre-made, and a little dry. The pasta was pretty hot, reminded me of blazing hot pasta from Olive garden. I have to assume it was nuked. Bummer because the chef  said it was her recipe. Paymon's much better. Stay away from chicken satay! Tasted really weird, like it wasn't chicken. Dark meat, strange texture. If I go again, I'll stick with burger with the gigantic onion rings."}
{"text":"So I go over to the Mall to purchase glasses and stumble upon this sports bar. NCAA was on and when I walked in there was a nice Projector big screen and several new TVs so I decided to have a drink and an appetizer. Liz was very nice so I order chicken skewers and a Beer (nice selection). Liz arrives over 10 minutes later to inform me that the chicken was spoiled and didn't know why the kitchen didn't tell her sooner. So I order a hamburger (hoping its a safe choice) 5 mins later I am given Calamari and laughed saying its not mine. 10 mins after that I get a mediocre at best burger w overcooked fries. (Here is my favorite part) This half-a**sed DJ booth 10 feet from me with no one hardly present in this place starts blowing thick smoke like an 80s Prince or MJ video, what a joke! All the while Liz was friendly and apologetic. Icing on the cake was after my bill settle I was overcharged $4 (skimming, mistake?) that I saw later in the week. I was nice enough to call and be patient and they said it would be taken care of. Today I'm told they do not have the capabilities to refund, huh?? Georgio informed me to come back in and I will be taken care of, ehhhh I'm good. Peace!"}
{"text":"I stopped in at Hatari for a bite to eat before a flight out of Vegas and I am glad I did. Very friendly and attentive staff, good food and drinks. Good music but not too loud. Really great sports bar! Thank you Hatari."}
{"text":"It's advertised as a sports bar (and they have plenty of screens), but the atmosphere is more like a nightclub, with ear-splitting music and female staff in mini-dresses. To their credit, the bartenders were extremely friendly and they were even doing some flip tricks.  The menu has good variety, from classic burgers and wings (get the Spicy Moroccan flavor for something different) to pizzas and entrees. I appreciate that healthy options are available like veggie burgers, a roasted salmon dish, and a few salads. The veggie burger recommended by the staff was fairly good and I was able to sub a side of vegetables for the fries without an upcharge. There's an interesting variety of beers on draft, including Woodchuck amber and Four Peaks Peach ale, as well as HH specials.    There's a video DJ after 7PM, and it's so loud that I had difficulty placing an order, let alone carrying on a conversation. It seems that what they're trying to do and what people are coming here for are two very different things. I'm in the area several times a week and will come back to try more of the menu but will be sure to do it early to avoid the noise.  NOTE: There doesn't seem to be way to enter from the mall and it's not easily visible from the street. It's located right behind the parking garage on the front side of the mall to the right of the main entrance."}
{"text":"I have to say hands down this place has the best pizza in town and  all the sport your heart wants it my new hang out spot !"}
{"text":"Melody, Christian,  Julio, Liz, and Chef Brian are an AWESOME staff!! Had the BEST TIME with this staff EVER!!!!  GREAT food AWESOME company!!!  New favorite spot.... BOULEVARD MALL is BACK to LIFE with this SPORTS BAR incorporated with The Boulevard Mall"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, so I really wanted this place to be great. So much so, that I had a bad experience and went back for a second bad experience, and then a third. Well... three strikes and you are out.   On a positive note, the food is fine. Not stellar, but fine. And kids under 10 eat free, which is nice. The menu states that the burgers are 10 ounces, which can't possibly be true. Maybe 6 or 7? Not 10. Fries are served sparingly also. The menu selection is ok for dinner, but pretty heavy for lunch. Aside for a few salads, it's all burgers and big entrees. Offering some good sandwiches would go a long way.  The main problem we've had is with the service. Three visits, 3 different servers, and they were all terrible. There's never been any more than 2 or 3 other patrons in the restaurant when I've been, and service has been unbelievably slow each time. 10 minutes to get waters, another 10 to get drinks and place orders, 10 minutes to bring blue cheese for my wings while they just sat there getting cold. My soda was refilled out of a pitcher of flat soda with mostly melted ice. Even on a jam packed night, these are things that shouldn't happen.  Servers have very little knowledge on the menu. There's  no beer list, and no one can tell you what they are. One server had no idea if the filet sliders were ground beef or actual filet. There is always something they need to ask someone else about in order to answer a question.  Lastly, the check out process happens on tablets, which is fine, except all three times there was problems with being able to pay via credit card instead of cash, and a managers assistance (and another 10 minutes) was required.  You can pay for billboards and advertise at all the UNLV games you want, but if you can't provide decent service, you're never going to get people to come back."}
{"text":"Great experience!  Came here with some friends for some good food and drinks and we were not disappointed! I had never been and I don't think anyone I went with had ever been either. The hostess was super friendly and accommodating and our waiter was great and attentive as well!  They played the soccer game on the TV closet to us at our request and gave us some time to look over the specialty cocktail menu. I opted for the first drink on the Menu which was the Hatari Special I believe it was a blue drink topped with fruit and lit on fire at your table (However mine was not lit on fire as they had had some accidents in the past.)   I ordered the classic burger with melted provolone cheese sauce and it was everything.  Literally everything.  Simply delicious!  I will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Nice place, great decor, awesome music and the food was on point.  Drinks are really reasonable here. Our waiter was nice and attentive plus the manager came over and checked on us.  The food was spicy but really good."}
{"text":"Great food ! Amazing service! The burgers are great ! I had the chicken tenders and they were cooked to perfection. I can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu. ! Pizza is amazing ! Drinks just make me keeping coming back !"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends, I found out about this place from JB Dance Studio at the Blvd mall and it was the best place ever. Staff is fun, friendly, attractive, and social what more can you ask for besides the great quality food."}
{"text":"I stopped by at this place because we were originally go to Olivia's, but Olivia's was going through a renovation. A guy outside gave us two coupons for free meals, so we decided to try the place out!  Cleanliness- the place is immaculately clean. (But it was slow on a Friday at 2pm).   Service- it's been mentioned before, but the staff really needs to be trained on what they are serving. They don't seem to know what they're selling! I asked for a recommendation, and the server responded, \"everything is good!\" It was an obvious attempt to hide the fact that she knew nothing about the menu.   Decor- the place has a very weird vibe. It's brand new, but somehow feels dated? When you enter the place it feels like you just entered a nightclub from 2007, the music is a little too loud.   The reason why this place gets one star is because of how absolutely terribly uninformed the staff is. There was a guy waking around (looks like the male version of Kruella Deville) who is obviously the manager, perhaps the owner, that came to our table and asked how our meal was going.   He asked us what drink we are drinking. How do you not know the SIGNATURE COCKTAILS that you serve. I ordered a Hatari Azul. It's supposed to have a cherry and blueberries, and it came with neither. To top it all off, it was PURE SUGAR. It was awful!    This place would be good if it had knowledgeable staff.   The food was alright. An overpriced Applebee's without the quality of Applebee's..."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar - doing what sports bars do! Probably assisted by the relationship to Olivia's, which is next door (and despite one bad experience, I must admit has incredible food, drinks and service), this place is great.  Wonderful place with wall-to-wall videos of sports - or whatever, they put on Dancing With the Stars for me, even though I am heterosexual - but the food is simple but great. The deconstructed calamari in fried wonton was great. The Hatari burger was better. Also, great pay-by-hour pool tables!  Close to downtown and my neighborhood of Huntridge. Thanks too to manager JIllian Wickham for her most welcome hospitality. This place is great and I hope it succeeds!!! Also, stop by Olivia's before you go and you can get a coupon for a free tropical mini-pizza. Quelle tasty!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this new bar restaurant at the boulevard mall. The experience was phenomenal! The place looks great, had so many TV playing all sports and the music was legit! The food was amazing, far beyond what you would expect from a bar. I highly recommend the chipotle nachos, wings, and their burgers. They had plenty of bartenders making pretty much any drink you can imagine!"}
