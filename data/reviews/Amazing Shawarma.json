{"text":"Probably my favourite shawarma place thus far. Never had a problem with them, they always give great portions, flavourful, and worth the money. Try to 2 shawarmas for under $10!"}
{"text":"The flavours here are very good. The shawarma plate and sandwich/pita are very good. All the ingredients are fresh! The place is clean and located in a strip plaza. If you want something that tastes good, is quality, is quick, and relatively affordable then this is the spot."}
{"text":"I drove a ways to get a chicken Shawarma after browsing their website which advertises amazing prices, arrived and learned that their prices are much more than what their website advertises. First disappointment, then he wanted to charge me extra for hummus on my wrap (which is ridiculous because all  shawarmas come with hummus on them) and then they didn't except visa which kind of sucks too but whatever. They didn't have too many condiments.... I walked out with nothing."}
{"text":"Not the best shawarma. Meat was dry and no sauce or salt for taste. Only pro is the price. 7.99 for 2 but you can get this deal elsewhere"}
{"text":"Amazing Shawarma is the best.  Everything tastes really good. There is a good variety, but the main dishes are shawarma and falafel. The staff are very friendly with customers. The hours are good too and it's open every day. There are lots of different cold drink choices. The prices are reasonable and you get a lot of food. You can eat at the restaurant or take out. They don't deliver."}
{"text":"This is a great shawarma place. Not overloaded with salt just lots of flavour, which means they prepare it properly and use herbs and spices(but not too much) instead of a load of salt. The most impressive thing about it is how fresh the food tastes. They obviously take great care to only use fresh veggies and meat and bread. It's not like subway where everything is in gross bins stored for days. The two guys that run this place care about the product and on top of all that they are very friendly and have reasonable prices.  Recommend highly."}
{"text":"Probably the WORST shawarma I ever had. I was super hungry, but even then found it to be very bad. The salad was not fresh. The server wasn't friendly and was very rude. Won't be back to this place ever."}
{"text":"Hands down the best, I mean absolutely the best damn shawarma spot in Scarborough.  They're called amazing Shawarma for a reason.  Big sandwiches, they are absolutely not stiff with the toppings either, they load them up. All of their sauces are home made from scratch in store. So clean and friendly inside. Best shawarma spot. They stay packed and busy from open to literally the closing time. Best spot, trust me, I tried most spots around the city, trust me  you will not waste your money, you will instantly become addicted after trying it just once. Promise."}
{"text":"I have been living in Scarborough for around 2 years . I prefer to try out new places . I landed at Amazing Shawarma one evening  and immediately fell in love with it. Their prices are reasonable and the taste is just great. They have amazing deals  ( 2 Shawarma for 7.49) . The Shawarma are huge and will fill you up. 
You must try the Shawarma plate (rice , chicken , sauce , salad ) . 
The burger is pretty good too. All in all a good place for anything ."}
{"text":"The shawarma here is just ok. There are better options in Scarborough, with better prices. Food is inconsistent at best. Somedays things taste perfectly cooked and other days stale and salty. They claim to make all their sauces in house, they aren't spectacular.
I keep going back out of convenience and my expectations are never high. It's a decent fast lunch if you're in this end of town.

Staff is friendly.

Debit and Cash are accepted here, no credit cards."}
{"text":"Great food for good value. 

I just wish they offered more toppings for your shewerama. It gets boring after a while."}
{"text":"There is no shortage of shawarma places in Scarborough and the competition is stiff so when I saw a new place pop up 2 minutes from my house about a month ago I eyed it on a daily basis. I finally had a chance to go in and give it a shot the other day. 

I went in for a late pre-workout lunch; I ordered 1 chicken shawarma sandwich with everything but lettuce and garlic sauce. My sandwich was thrown in the pita haphazardly and warmed up in a panini press. The sandwich was a good size (see pics) and only ran me about $4.25 tax in (they have a deal of 2 sandwiches for $6.99). The sandwich was a decent representation of what a shawarma should be but it did not blow me away. What I did like was that the chicken had a nice crispiness to it, the vegetables were all fresh and crunchy and the key to the whole sandwich was the panini press which gave the pita a very light crispness that I enjoyed. I do have a few complaints though; the gentlemen preparing my sandwich was simply throwing in the toppings without much care or consideration, a good shawarma sandwich will have the right balance of each ingredient so as not to overwhelm the flavour of the meat, the carelessness with which my sandwich was prepared resulted in big bites of nothing but raw onion or cabbage on a couple of occasions. Another complaint is that my sandwich was drowned in tahini sauce, this really overwhelmed the flavour of the meat, and their tahini sauce was too lemony for my liking. Lastly their spicy sauce was rather weak and had no kick to it whatsoever. Overall my sandwich was serviceable and I would put their food on par with that of a villa medina but far from some of the better places in little Arabia along Lawrence Ave. 

The restaurant itself is located in a small strip mall that is somewhat sketchy; the place is bare bones but cleaner than I had anticipated. The menu consists of shawarma, falafel and hamburgers all of which are very reasonably priced, one can get a decent lunch here for $5 no problem. If you are in the area and looking for a cheap bite this place is not a bad option but they certainly do have some improving to do. All foods served here are halal. 

*2.5 stars for now

{"text":"New Amazing Shawarma location in the Midland/Lawrence plaza. 

Came in 5 minutes to close, got 2 shawarma wraps that were stuffed to the rafters! Chicken, lettuce, shredded carrots, onions, pickeled turnips, parsley, tomatoes, garlic, tahini, hot sauce... oh yeah! I get everything! 

So, so good! I'll be back for more. 2 for $8.88 special is on right now for their grand opening special. Won't last long I figure, take advantage!"}
{"text":"I have encouraged people to eat at Amazing Shawarma over the past several months. When they first opened, I thought it was great. After eating there consistently over the past several months I have seen their portion size get smaller, their staff become less professional (whenever you walk in the staff are always eating at a table and they seem bothered to serve you). I don't think I will be going back to Amazing Shawarma anymore."}
{"text":"We were craving shawarma and were pleasantly surprised to know they had daily specials for their platters for only $9 each. What a steal! Two platters set us back only $20 and was quite filling. 

We ordered one chicken and one beef shawarma plates. Everything was delicious and you got two sides with each plate. We expected the beef to be somewhat dry (it was), but the moistness of the rice more than made up for it; it was great rice and extremely flavorful. The chicken was also super tasty and a had a very 'homestyle' taste to it; reminding me of Montreal seasoning, and wasn't overly salty. The seasoned potatoes were freshly fried herbed potato wedges. The salad was good and included all the components of the pickles. There was also a cabbage based slaw included. It's a very comprehensive plate and for that value, it's tough to beat!

They didn't overly douse the plates with tahini which is great but I feel we could have definitely used a bit more garlic sauce. I get a very healthy vibe from these plates as the meat and sauce was 'lean', something I definitely don't mind."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch very often for a few reason. The service I get form the proprietor, Nasar, is fantastic he is friendly and calls you by name, once you tell him your name that is. The food is absolutely great my favourite menu items is the shawarma combo and the hamburger combo. The shawarma you get your choice of chicken, beef, or mix of the two. The hamburger is so juicy and made to order, you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. Nasar only uses the best of ingredients and everything is made from scratch and made to order for a superior taste. 

This location has only been open for a few months but it has now become my favorite lunch place! I recommend this place highly. 

***they take debit cards now***"}
{"text":"With a name like \"Amazing Shawarma\" expectations would naturally be high, so everything needs to be on point.

The Aroma of roasting meats are enticing when you walk in. Service is lightening fast but not warm nor friendly. 

Ordered a shawarma mixed plate to go. They need to work on presentation, it looked like a mess. Tried everything separately first: rice is bland, salad needed more dressing, hot sauce was plopped down in the middle so I had to spread it myself, and what's up with the baby fork that can't pick up anything. Both the chicken and beef were tender but preferred the taste of the chicken over the beef. 

Other places offer hummus and a pita to go along with their shawarma plates. Overall the taste, portion and cost were ok not amazing."}
{"text":"There are much better options in Scarborough than this place. AL tanoor, nasibs or even Ibrahim taste much better and fresh."}
{"text":"We visited here due to the good reviews and we were definitely impressed - esp for a fast food restaurant. The beef shawarma and chicken kebabs were delicious as well as the sauces. The only things that I would gripe on was that the falafels were dry and they don't serve fatoush which is surprising. But I would definitely order from here again. The food actually tasted great and value wise was \"amazing\"."}
{"text":"Decided to come in at exactly 9:55pm so cutting it close to closing but technically not closed. Ask if they are able to serve, refused to. Takes away the chicken Shawarma directly in front of me & has the authority to say \"Who cares, it's only 5 minutes\" when I tell them you're still technically open. If it was exactly 10 or much later, completely understandable. Never been so offended by customer service anywhere."}
{"text":"I love this place. They also have a second location at Midland and Lawrence Ave E. I get the 2 Shawarma deal. 2 for $12 you just can't beat that. One is a good amount 2 is a struggle to finish.  You can get chicken Beef or a mix lots of different topping and sauces as well."}
{"text":"Truly amazing Shawarma!
Fresh and tasty. Right amount of spices.
So happy I discovered this place!"}
{"text":"So...um...YUM!!! My dad discovered this place and told me I had to try it. So he picked some up one day after work for the fam and I'm hooked. This place has delicious shawarma. I hate onions and they are able to create my dish without it without question. They are highly professional and friendly. The veggies are fresh and the shawarma is juicy. Overall, AMAZING SHAWARMA"}
