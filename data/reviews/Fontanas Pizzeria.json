{"text":"this ranks in my top five pizza places. It is almost like Monicals pizza in Illinois. If you like Vito's pizza in Mesa, you will like this. It is even better."}
{"text":"We came across this truck at the Melrose Street Fair in Phoenix this afternoon. We were told it was the only pizza food truck there, so we gave it a shot. Cons: Expensive! $11 for a tiny pizza - and that's the cheap one! Crust was burnt. Sauce has zero flavor. Fumes from generator are enough to gas you. Pros: Still trying to think of something... Spend your cash somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza to go! got the Pep and sausage and the alfredo chicken. so worth it and two people can share one easily!!! Will be following this food truck and eating more of it!"}
{"text":"I just met these guys in the parking lot outside work, and I wanted to see what was going on. The guys inside the truck are really cool, and happy to explain what they have for pizzas. It only took about eight minutes and I had my pie.   The crust is thin and crispy. The cheeses hot melted with a great Alfredo sauce. It's a little big for one person, probably better to share for two. They put some bacon on the chicken Alfredo and man it's good! Definitely will try to find their truck again."}
{"text":"Their truck stopped by work today; being that I had no car, I was limited... and kinda scared after reading some reviews.   Small????? Whoever calls these pizzas \"too small\" need to have their heads examined. I couldn't finish it and I'm a big girl with a big appetite.   The crust... which any pizza aficionado will tell you will make or break a pizza - was absolutely spot on. For being made in a truck, I was shocked by this. It was thin with that cracker flavor/feeling to it. Served piping hot.   The cheese was very obviously hand grated and not purchased grated. When you buy the bags of grated mozz, it has cellulose, potato starch and Natamycin which prevent it from melting. The cheese on this pizza was ooey, gooey and melty-licious! Great texture! I did feel that the pie I got lacked a freshness zing (like fresh tomatoes, some arugula or even olives), the chicken was nicely cooked/seasoned and the red onions gave it a sweetness. The pesto was a little on the bland side; but I'm the type who makes mine from scratch with organic ingredients so my pesto bar is naturally high to begin with.   While I had to add a little fresh-ground pepper to my pie, I do that with any pie.   Good show, guys. You have a fan at FMIC!"}
