{"text":"Food isn't bad, but it's a real rip-off.  The waitress charged for something other than what was ordered and argued that that's what the price should have been.  The menu price was $13.50 (which is high for two eggs, hash browns, English muffin and bacon), but we were charged $15.50, with attitude."}
{"text":"They had a great breakfast buffet for a reasonable price. Considering the lack of options around here, the bacon was crispy, the options were plentiful, and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"We ate here for convenience when staying at Doubletree. The breakfast buffet was $19, and definitely not worth the price. The bacon and toast were way overdone, the hash browns too salty, and the coffee tasted weird."}
