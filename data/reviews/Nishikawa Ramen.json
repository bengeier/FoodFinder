{"text":"This place is really good. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable for the portion size. I eat here often and haven't had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food, I'm looking forward to going back and bringing more people!"}
{"text":"went to ramen house as it opened on as Sunday.   Our egg was dry hard boiled.   Noodles were ok, side and broth was ok also.   Service was lagging as we were the only ones there but had to flag them down to get service."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. We tried Nishikawa and Yokohama Ramens and both were just OK. Slightly better than Dozo's, broth is better than Tampopo's, but Tampopo is the clear winner for the noodles themselves. Our waitress were unable to pronounce the Japanese menu items correctly, and that is such a shame."}
{"text":"The food was great. They really need to work on their service. One of the waitresses was kind of friendly but I felt like it was fake. The other waitress who was serving me was nice but did not greet me quickly.  The people that came in five minutes after me had drinks and their food faster. My appetizer came out after the Ramen. The guy behind the bar is VERY unfriendly and impersonal, borderline rude. He never smiled and it just looked like he didn't want to be there. I hope he's not the owner albeit he was pretty young. I won't be coming back and it's unfortunate because I live less than a mile away. I want to feel welcomed when I dine out and I didn't feel that way tonight. I think the service will alienate other customers just like me and these guys will be out of business within the first 12-15 months depending on how many free months their landlord gave them. It's too bad because the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Really surprised by both the four star rating and the crowd at Nishikawa. First time there and not impressed. Maybe I'm missing something?   Food was overlooked and missing ingredients described by the waitress. And chicken should be more brown than gray, right?  Limited drink selection and small menu.  Wait staff was attentive and friendly. One full star for that."}
{"text":"This place is a must try! We had the Nishikawa Black and Curry Ramen and loved both. Our waitress was so pleasant made our visit that much better!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times with friends and family in the last month. The ramen is good, the chashu a bit on the fatty side, the egg isn't as soft-boiled as one might prefer, but the broth insofar as the black garlic and the spicy miso are both quite tasty. The noodles are ok - strong flavors in the soup mask the quality of the house-made noodles, as the sign says out front in kanji.  But the real stars of the show, oddly, are the starters: takoyaki, chicken and squid kara age, and gyoza. The takoyaki are surprisingly fantastic, probably some of the best I've had on this coast. We've ordered two servings each time we go there. The kara age is well seasoned and crisp without being oily. The gyoza are moist and pan-fried with a crispy lacy bottom. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Lived three years in Japan and I've gotta say... this ramen comes extremely close to the shops I frequented. I had the miso ramen here and it was delicious. The pork belly was very tender and delicious, and the presentation was spot on to how authentic japanese style ramen is served. Unfortuneately, the way its prepared here is slightly varianted as there is an extra ingredient I couldnt put my finger on. That definitely wasnt a deal breaker though as a kick of soy sauce brought everything into a delicious balance. The pork gyoza is a 10 out of 10 easily. The dining area could use a little more culture influence, but its definitely got that clean, quaint ramen shop atmosphere Ive grown to love."}
{"text":"Great ramen, we've tried the Nishawaka Black and the Yokohama as well as the pork gyoza. We've eaten in the restaurant and picked up take out, both times were delicious and the staff was very courteous."}
{"text":"Best ramen I have had in the east valley. I usually get the Tonkotsu and add some of the chili powder on the table to make it spicy. The round octopus pancakes are also a great starter."}
{"text":"Our family loves ramen and we always look for a ramen place whenever we travel. We found this place through yelp and we were glad we tried it out.   We really liked the ramen. The broth was very flavorful and the seasoned egg was a good complement to the ramen. A must try too is the takoyaki and the gyoza. I rated it 4 stars despite the  good food because we can see the trash from where we were seated. Other than that, it is a must try if you like ramen."}
{"text":"Finally have a good ramen place close to my house. Been there twice. First time was dinner, small place with fast service. Second was lunch, only one sever during lunch hour but she tried her best to serve us. There was an angry customer though because he was there first and his food was not served even though people got in after him got their food. He was pretty upset, yelling at the server couple times even though the manager already came out and apologized to him. I think the server and manager handled him pretty well and tried hard to please the guy. I think he just made a fool out of himself with his attitude and his voice. Silly customer! But their ramens are pretty delicious! The pork both is rich in favor, the meat is tender melt in my mouth and the egg is well marinaded! Overall will definitely come here again when i want ramen!"}
{"text":"The Shio Ramen was amazing! The service was good. The only thing I didn't find comfortable was the temperature inside the restaurant. It was super hot inside. But if just rating the food, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Ha ha! I like Japanese food.  I ate ramen noodles here. They are so cheap and oK."}
{"text":"The broth is lacking flavor You have to request a soft boiled egg Noodles are good for the price."}
{"text":"Great place, easily some of the best ramen I have ever had. I came in and was greeted right away. When I was seated the waitress brought me water with out me asking which was nice. She then thoroughly explained the menu to me, I ordered the Yokohama style ramen which was very good. They continued to check up on me. Great service and great food five stars!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came on MLK day to have lunch. We waited to be seated by the door; it took the workers a few minutes to notice that we were there because no one was paying attention. Once we were seated, we were ignored for 20 minutes. No menus or waters were provided. Many workers walked right past us while they were cleaning up other tables. Obviously, they were not pressed for time nor were they busy, they were just horrible at serving. We had to flag someone down twice; the first time to ask for menus and the second time to ask for waters. Side note- the water tasted very gross, a delightful combination of metallic and sewer. Once we were ready to order, again the servers proceeded to clean tables instead of helping us. The saving grace of this place is the ramen, which was surprisingly good. I think the best that I've had in the Valley.   TLDR; ramen is good, but service is god awful."}
{"text":"Definitely try this place out! I ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen, takoyaki, and green tea ice cream and I'm so happy that I gave this restaurant a go! The spicy tonkatsu ramen's broth was flavorful and delicious, the pork was juicy and melt-in-your-mouth tender and the noodles were so fresh and delicious, you could tell they were homemade with a lot of care. The takoyaki was by far some of the best I've ever had, and the green tea ice cream was an excellent sweet finish to a satisfyingly delicious meal. Not to mention, the owner and employees were absolutely delightful. Can't wait to come again next time! :)"}
{"text":"We are so excited that we found this Ramen place! My kids loved it and my youngest ate 3 bowls of noodles. The food was great and my kids are already asking when we can go back."}
{"text":"We love ramen. So we went to this restaurant after we heard about it. We ordered original miso ramen, spicy miso ramen and nishikawa black ramen. They were tasty and flavorful. My favorite is the nishikawa black ramen. Each bowl came with generous portion of noodle, good amount of soup, 1 whole egg, 1 big piece of chasu and toppings.  This ramen style reminds us of the Tsujita Ramen in Sawtell, LA, which offers oily, thick soup and thick noodle.  Some suggestions. The noodle is a bit too thick, and the overall soup was quite oily. So, these 2 combinations will it filling really quick. It would be great the restaurant offers thinner noodle and less oily soup option. This will make it more appetizing.  On the other hand, I would rate it one of the top ramen restaurants in AZ."}
{"text":"Been here one time only but it very much satisfied my ramen drought since when in Sacramento. Great ramen bowl, good flavor and presentation, only one caveat, NOT BIG ENOUGH !(for me- lol)  So go, you won't be left with bad taste in your buds, just more desire for more times eating this great bowl of noodles.  I got the everything w/oil, spicy and pork, yumm !  (EDIT about my returning to this RAMEN bowl.)  I've returned, yes I have... Wonderful, nourishing and flavorful ! Maybe better flavor now because I know what I'm getting.  Just GOOOOOOOO, you'll be  !"}
{"text":"It's pretty much the best ramen place I have tried so far in Arizona. Like there is no argument about that. But I wouldn't say it's the best I have ever had. The decor of the store is very homely. The gyoza is very obviously frozen store bought, but the technique making it is remarkable. The broth is rich. The ramen is very authentic. Overall a great place for ramen."}
{"text":"We've only ever ordered their ramen for pickup, but it has always been tasty hot. They make sure to package it in two containers: noodles in one and broth in the other. I'm no expert in ramen, but they have a savory broth that complements the noodles well."}
{"text":"Will have to try this place again way after thier grand opening to see if it improves. If you run out of ramen tell your customers at the door or put up a sign to say so. Service was very slow. Since they don't have any ramen, we order the only avail thing on the menu, which is rice bowls. My wife order a chicken bowl, when she was eating it told me the chicken is pretty fatty. So I took a bit of it and it was pork belly and not chicken. If we have any allergy or religious reason to not eat pork this would have been a problem."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the service was quick and friendly. We had the Tonkotsu and the pork  broth was incredible.  The seasoned egg was a complete surprise and extremely tasty.  The Pork chashu was very flavorful and we greatly enjoyed our lunch.  Highly recommended and a very simple menu of wonderful selections.   Good Job folks"}
{"text":"I can't believe we didn't come check this place out sooner! I'm vegetarian and I didn't see anything on the menu for me so at first I was bummed, but our server recommended the vegetarian ramen and it was delicious! Service was great and the food was amazing! We can't wait to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best Ramen I've had in Arizona.  Maybe the best piece of pork I've ever put in my mouth!  Definitely the best chasu I've ever had.  Broth and noodles are too 3 for me."}
{"text":"Best Ramen place in town. We had Nishikawa black and takoyaki. Both taste great. The service is nice and the Japanese beer is special."}
{"text":"Oh man, so lucky I found this place.   Amazing food!  Service very good and pleasant.   But the food. WOW!!!  Never knew this style of Japanese food existed.   If you're near, stop and eat at this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Ramen, so I decided to go with a basic Miso one. I thought it was deliciious for such a normal basic ramen dish. I can't wait to come here again to try some of the other ramen. I came at lunch rush and was pleased at how moderately filled it was (not too crowded and not too empty). They also had a list of different Sakes and had it been dinner I might have tried one."}
{"text":"Went on friday the day of the soft opening. It got extremely crowded and a little unorganized but it was a soft opening so it was expected. Staff took a bit but you could tell they were putting in the effort. When we did get our food it was honestly THE BEST RAMEN IN AZ . 5 stars for the food. Though staff is still getting things together i definately would not pass this place up."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my boyfriend after seeing me friends go and I absolutely love it! It's hard finding some good Japanese ramen in Arizona and this spot is great for its price! It wasn't too packed so the wait wasn't as long as I thought. I ordered the Spicy Tonkatsu with sprint bean sprouts and my boyfriend ordered the Nashikawa Ramen bowl. The service here is quick and they get your food and drinks in a flash! I was so impressed! The price here is reasonable for what you get and I'm glad I tried this place, will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The last time i was here the ramen was too oily. That's the only complain i have. The ramen is authentic and It tastes good but with less oil it will be perfect!  And also i hope there is an option for chicken or tempura shrimp in addition to the fatty pork. The takoyaki is the best!! It was as good if not better than the one i had in Tokyo 4 months ago."}
{"text":"Got the nishikawa black and the broth was not hot. Luke warm and very oily broth is not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"great broth, noodles, toppings, etc... only request would be for more flavorful egg ... maybe try soft boiled"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and outstanding service.  I love the traditional atmosphere and how prompt the service was.  It made for a quick but great dinner"}
{"text":"This new location is great.  The food is even better and the service was upbeat and extremely helpful.   The miso ramen was just perfect and a great meal!"}
{"text":"I tried this place last Thursday  and I ordered to go and got the standard pork dish  after arriving back home I found that not only was my order wrong  they also stacked the to go cups causing the one on top to melt through the lid of the one on bottom leading to a spill in my Car and a bag full of broth  I went back they fixed the order and gave me a coupon for a free meal  while I thought that was fine  and it was just a simple mistake I then went to eat this new dish  I found it to be very tasty until I got food poisoning the next day which lasted all weekend  today is the first day I've eaten anything solid since  and it was prob the worst food poisoning I've ever had  I most definitely will not be going back  all though the food was good I felt I should let people know that something happened  idk if it was cleanliness or raw food but it was bad  be aware!"}
{"text":"First time here and I've gotta say, it was actually pretty good!  I ordered Spicy Tonkatsu ramen: The broth was very tasty and the waitress asked for a spice level (I ordered medium). I feel like medium was a good level of spice balanced with flavor. It wasn't spicy per se, but it was very nicely flavored. It looks like they use a chili oil (I saw reviews that said the broth was oily) so yes, it SEEMS oily, but it's the chili oil. It also comes with a good amount of noodles, and chashu. The bean sprouts are marinated to be spicy (which didn't seem spicy? Idk - my spice level is pretty high) and it also came with green onions and an egg. I ordered an extra egg (I heart nitamago)!  For dessert I ordered red bean ice cream that came with colorful mochi toppings and had a little bit of condensed milk mixed in. Perfect.  All in all, coming from Los Angeles, this place served the best ramen in AZ.... Will come back whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh, deliciousness! Good for the soul! Loved it. Simple, quick and not too many choices. Just simple goodness!"}
{"text":"It is hard to find good ramen in the east Valley, and this place is delicious.  I highly recommend the pork gyoza and the tonkatsu ramen.  I can't wait to come back and give the miso ramen a try."}
{"text":"Best bowl of ramen in town. I had the tonkotsu and the broth is hands down the most thick and flavorful I've had in the metro area. The pork is a bit fatty, but it's so tender and good! The only issues I have is the place is pretty small, so you sometimes have to wait a while to be seated. Service is dicey as well. I give the food 5 stars, but the other factors knock it down to 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best ramen in town. I like the Nishikawa Black. The tonkotsu broth is rich and thick, and the pork belly is high quality and you get a lot of good stuff in the bowl. The taki balls with the shaved Bonita is also a great appetizer. I'm so happy they have a location in Phoenix! I will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Wish there were more broth choices but it's nice ramen place. Pork broth only. We will come back when we crave for it. Noodles were good.  My kids love my homemade Ramen better but I don't mind this place. But I wanna try other Ramen places with more choices."}
{"text":"Solid. The restaurant interior was pleasant. The menu was of a manageable size and had the traditional dishes. I ordered the Nishikawa black and the food did not take long to arrive. The staff was friendly and efficient.   The straight noodles were handmade, the broth was solid, the pork belly was tender. The broth and texture on the pork belly and menma put this a level above Tampopo for me. The option for a soft-boiled egg put it as a five star within the Phoenix metro area for me. I like this place. It will go into my regular rotation of dinner spots!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this this place countless times, but I was skeptical.   First, the service was good, but it was at the end of the night, so I think the staff was tired and overlooked some things. Not a huge deal, but could be better. The food was good. we order a black garlic oil ramen bowl with extra noodles and an ikura bowl to share. The ramen broth was good, not too heavy yet not bland. The downside was the noodles. The noods were clumped together from not stirring enough while cooking. It would have been a perfect bowl if the noodles were cooked properly. The Ikura rice bowl was good too without any flaws.  I'd definitely come back again. Maybe not so close to closing because the quality in service is definitely diminished due to understandable fatigue from the staff."}
{"text":"Trust this, I'm no Ramen Noodle expert by any means.  Until today my experience with Ramen was the dehydrated version commonly associated with prison currency LOL. That being said, this quaint and trendy spot located in a corner of a shopping plaza blew my mind.  OMG! Was the food delicious.  Came in on a Saturday after noon and there was ample seating to accommodate the handful of patrons.  There are roughly 12 4 seat tables and about the same number of stools at the bar area.  Between the wife and I we ordered the Miso, Nishikawa, Pork Gyoza, Spring Roll and a chicken appetizer that I can't recall the name .  I highly recommend making time to check Nishikawa Ramen out."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Went in to try the place and it was packed. Not a bad thing so we put our name down for a table. We had our 2 year old with us and waiting is usually a hard thing but we figured it would be worth it. Left our number and headed outside to entertain her while we were waiting for our table to try this place. Going back in after 15 min they seated another couple right as we walked in. The waitress that sat them didn't know we had been waiting (I'm assuming they are all not on the same page since they didn't check the sheet before seating them) one the other waitress noted that we were next and had been waiting they didn't even have the decency to apologize. Standing around i just said it's fine we will eat somewhere else. Super bummed because we have heard good things about the food however not even an apology on the situation with a restless two year old makes for a pretty upset customer.   *edit*  Received a call from the manager apologizing for the situation acknowledgment goes a long way and very appreciative of the way she handled the situation. Will be going back to give it another go."}
{"text":"Been thinking of trying this place for a long time, but it's kind of a drive so was not on top of the list. However, finding reviews to be mostly favorable, finally gave it a shot and had lunch delivered. Extremely disappointing..   First of all, they use small, and flimsy, containers for the broth. Both were placed on the bottom of a paper bag with the larger, and heavier noodle bowl on top. Needles to say when the delivery person reached for the bag, the bottom gave out as some broth had spilled. It was a mess! The food didn't fare any better..  I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen. Ugh! The broth was salty and the pork even more so! Could not eat it.. disappointing for sure.  My wife ordered he Nishikawa Black Ramen. Same noodles as mine and maybe some string of dark noodles on bottom? Not much difference in taste between the two separate dishes. Hers too was salty and the pork inedible.   Both dishes were ordered with the Seasoned Egg (the other option was a seasoned hard boiled egg which questions the difference as we both got seasoned hard boiled eggs). Nothing special about the seasoning.  The Chicken Gyoza was the only decent dish. Though the soy sauce, with a hint of vinegar, seemed overly diluted and too small a potion for the 6 dumplings.   We really wanted the place to impress but the Ramen just didn't live up to expectations. Sigh."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. It was just OK. The miso broth was not very good but the spicy tonkatsu broth was tasty. The pork in both soups was extremely fatty.   Service was good.   Will I go back?  Probably not."}
{"text":"At 3:00pm on Sunday I was the only one in the place.  No other customers came in to eat during the entire time.  I saw a couple enter when I was in the parking lot after though.  Takoyaki: Came out after the ramen.  Not good.  It had way too much sauce slathered on it, and I just didn't care for the taste or texture.  I was expecting something crispier, but I've never had takoyaki before to be fair.  Tonkatsu ramen: The chashu pork is very fatty, but prepared well and is quite tasty.  The broth is decent, but also very oily compared to other tonkatsu/pork broths I've had.  The serving size of noodles was quite small.  In fact, the entire bowl of ramen was on the small side, though the shallow bowl design visually tricks you into thinking there is more.  The noodles were okay, but I would have preferred them to be more firm for a better chew.  They use a hard boiled egg (I prefer a soft boiled egg or tamagoyaki/flat rolled then chopped omelette style), but it did look like it was boiled in soy sauce at least.  Random observations: The waitress provided solid service.  The restaurant is freezing cold.  The tile floor is super slippery and feels like it has a heavy coating of wax on it.  Parking was super easy.  Music choice is horrible.  I probably won't come back, as Cherry Blossom is much closer to me and Aloha Kitchen still holds the crown for best noodles and broth with their saimin.  But I wish them all the best!"}
{"text":"4 words.. I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Food is amazing, try their soda pops they are amazing. Very reasonable priced, perfect for a cold day."}
{"text":"Great Ramen ! Totally authentic and the Gyoza is fantastic."}
{"text":"Not at all authentic.  The noodles are not good ramen noodles,  they lack the chew n texture of ramen noodles.   It was more of a Chinese noodle.   We had spicy tonkatsu,  original tonkatsu,  spicy miso and black.   The spicy tonkatsu lacked flavor and was oily. The only ramen that had decent flavor was the black.   Service was awful,  wrong orders,  missing items,  didn't take down items ordered. We will not be back"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes. Make sure to ask for the egg to be soft otherwise you get a hard boiled egg by default."}
{"text":"Clean all black atmosphere serving delicious ramen.  Service was fast and friendly even though the restaurant was busy at lunch time. Eggs can be hard or soft boiled which is a nice touch not a lot of places do. Spring roll spicy sweet and sour sauce is a must try."}
{"text":"I ordered the yakohoma ramen in do not recommend it! It did not have any flavor, the noodles were super hard, and the meat was not good. The curry one was okey"}
{"text":"This was my first try at noodles. I think I picked the right place to start.   This guy knows what he is doing.   I had the Shio bowl.  The broth is wonderful.  The noodles are great.  Overall experience was fantastic and I will be back soon.  You can teach and old dog (me) new tricks."}
{"text":"Very awesome place! My god traveling to Arizona came across this authentic restaurant literally made my trip so much better with super appetite.   I did not except to enjoy this city while passing by. Arizona is getting so much better.   Awesome food , awesome service"}
{"text":"Good place for ramen!  I came in around 800pm and sat at the bar. The place is small but had steady business. The menu is pretty basic. Had about 6 different ramen options and 6 rice bowl options. Appetizers were pot stickers, spring rolls, fried chicken wings and a pancake deep fried with octopus.  I ordered the Yokohama Ramen and the pork pot stickers. It was tasty. The Yokohama came with a slice of pork belly, a square of seaweed, a hard boiled egg in a really tasty broth topped with green onions all with the ramen noodles. The pork was very tender!  The gyoza were all pan fried together and had a nice crust. Came with the traditional dipping sauce. There was a beer, wine and sake selection and some dessert as well. Next time I want to try the deep fried pancake appetizer with octopus!"}
{"text":"I did not care for the food here. We had the Gyoza to start, which were fine but I didn't even finish my Ramen. The place is clean, the server was fairly attentive, and the prices were reasonable. We came for lunch on a Monday and for how few tables that were there it took a really long time to get our food. Then my husband's came and it was several more minutes before mine arrived. I purposely didn't order any of the selections with anything with seaweed or fish essence since I don't like anything \"fishy\" tasting but mine did have a strange flavor. I've had Ramen before and liked it but this just wasn't my thing."}
{"text":"We drove two hours to try this place because we strong cravings for Ramen. We usually go to Tampopo Ramen in Tempe but I told my husband to try this. We ordered black Ramen, Takoyaki and Chicken Gyoza. Ramen we're rich of flavor it was so good but I think it was way too greasy. Other than that everything was okay."}
{"text":"The ramen scene is starting to grow in Arizona (still nowhere close to California) and this was posed to me as one of the best in the state, which may have led to my inflated expectations. We ordered the Nishikawa Black ramen, a chashu donburi, and a tonkotsu ramen. Both ramen bowls were good and filling, but the Nishikawa Black didn't appear to have any additional taste over the tonkotsu - in fact, I preferred the regular tonkotsu over the Nishikawa Black. Looking at the menu, the broth of all the bowls don't appear to be that different, which makes me think that they're using only one or two broth bases in the kitchen and adjusting slightly for each variation. The toppings were of good quality, and I enjoyed the big slices of chashu in each bowl. The curly noodles are definitely more satisfying to chew on and grab hold of the soup better, so I would recommend getting those substituted in to any bowl that you have. The chashu donburi was good, but lacking flavor - it didn't appear to have a lot of sauce on it, and that lack of sauce contributed to the lack of flavor in the rice as well. The chashu looked like the same slice that's used in the ramen, which is fine, but it should be chopped/cubed for the rice bowl.  Service was quick and pleasant. I heard and read that service was pretty slow, but that wasn't the case when we went - perhaps it's been fixed. I give it 3.5 stars, rounded down because it didn't leave an impression on me."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to Arizona about 2 years ago and were so happy when we found this Ramen location. We have been all over Arizona and Nishikawa has to be the best. Not only is the food amazing, but the service is great. Debbie normally serves us and she always remembers our order (we come often). She even remembered from a week ago that our order was messed up and gave us a complimentary order of Pork Gyoza. I also never used to be a huge miso fan, I normally stuck with Tonkostu, but when I tried my husband's, I fell in love. Now I always get spicy miso (mild). Thanks for being awesome and helping fill the void of our favorite Ramen location in Orange County!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Nishikawa black bowl, the tonkotsu ramen order that comes with the most toppings, by far, out of all the ramen bowls they offer here.  Here's my personal breakdown of the bowl:  - The pork broth had the thick, creamy texture that I look for in tonkotsu ramen, and the flavor wasn't too overwhelming either.   - The noodles were easy to pick up with chopsticks and slurp on.  Plus, they had the springy, chewy texture to them. - The pork chashu is also delicately flavored; however, it's roughly half fat, half lean meat.  I usually look for 70-80% lean meat on my chashu, but this is personal preference.  If you like more fatty chashu, this place is a pretty solid choice.   - The seasoned egg was OK.  It was hard-boiled, unfortunately, so you won't get the full flavor from the egg itself.  On a side note, you can add an extra egg, soft or hard-boiled.  It'll just cost you $1 extra.  As far as the restaurant atmosphere goes, it is somewhat small.  The max capacity is about 50 people.  Seating wasn't a problem for my friends and me during lunchtime this Sunday, thankfully."}
{"text":"I normally hate Asian foods, Japanese, Chinese, whatever. But my husband likes it so I still go with him at times to eat it. But this food is so amazingly good! I was floored! We both had Ramen bowls, we shared an octopus appetizer, and we ended with green tea ice cream and EVERYTHING was delicious. My husband said it was THE BEST ramen he has ever had! This food totally changed my mind about this type of food; apparently I've just been eating at the wrong places all these years.   The place is clean, friendly, and the staff is knowledgable of their menu. Double check their hours because they serve a traditional Japanese lunch and dinner, and they're closed for a couple of hours in between the two. The restaurant is small but doesn't feel cramped. But I foresee it becoming really popular with people lining up outside to eat here!   Please tell me you are going to put a location in Phoenix! PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Not many places in this area are open past 9 pm. For this place to be open until 10 pm in Chandler/Gilbert automatically deserves bonus points. Great place for ramen if you live in the East Valley! The servers are friendly and the service is quick. Considering there's no ramen places near besides DOZO or Tampopo, this is a nice little spot with plenty of parking to get your ramen fixings."}
{"text":"As a California native visiting Arizona for the first time, quality and especially authenticity were not what I expected from any Asian restaurant here. Nishikawa Ramen, located in an unassuming plaza, has blown me away with its amazing food, changing my entire perception of the possibilities of this region.   Having lived in Los Angeles for the past five years, I have tried Japanese ramen at all the famous LA spots--Daikokuya, Shinsengumi, Maruya, Men Oh, Tsujita, etc. I am shocked to find myself being able to unequivocally declare that Nishikawa, located in an abandoned pink plaza in the middle of a desert, is one of the best ramen places I have ever been to. I went twice in two days. On the first day I tried the Original Tonkotsu, and the next day I tried the Original Miso. Both were great, the miso one being slightly milder. I would recommend the miso one if you find ramen to be generally too salty. Another thing that distinguishes this place is that they make their own noodles from scratch in the back, unlike most ramen places, which buy theirs' from a supplier.   The chicken karaage is superb, unlike the karaage at many other locations, which are oily and make me feel guilty after.  I was satisfied about all the other aspects of the restaurant--a wide variety of imported Japanese drinks, cute decorations, and friendly staff.   I might come back to Arizona just for this place."}
{"text":"the ramen was okay, but was not really a fan of the katsu or gyoza (chicken)."}
{"text":"They have one of the best broth. Some other Ramen place tend to make fake broth by adding soy source in it and you can tell."}
{"text":"Very authentic and delicious Ramen! It's even better than many Ramen restaurants in Bay Area. You can never forget the taste and will definitely come back!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Holy ramen, this place is delicious!   Came in for lunch and was greeted and seated quickly. Although there was only one server, she was very quick and attentive. We got takoyaki, pork gyoza, and chicken karage for appetizer and I got the spicy tonkatsu ramen and my best friend got the house black. Everything was delicious!   Pros: + The broth is so satisfyingly savory but not heavy to make you feel sick of it. + the sliced pork the ramen came with was nice and tender and just melts in your mouth + takoyaki is crispy on the outside but light and fluffy in the inside with a decent size of octopus. Hands down the best I've had. They sauced it perfectly!  + the chicken karage is so fresh and they give you a ton, felt like that could have been a meal of its own.  Cons: - the noodles were a little on the soft side, would love if they were a little chewier - the pork gyoza was not that impressive. I would skip this if you plan on ordering other appetizers.  - the ramen came with seasoned egg and we thought it would be soft boil but it wasn't, would ask for it to be soft boil next time.   I ordered my food as is to taste how it comes but definitely would do add on to my ramen next time.   Still on the hunt to find the ramen that would change my mind about all ramen but until then, this place will do (:"}
{"text":"Possibly the best ramen spot in Phoenix. I typically eat at shensen gumi in Orange County. I gotta say this one comes very close in comparison. Except this place has better quality control.   Another good note is they let me swotch my pork for beef for extra charge which i don't mind. Most ramen joins wont do that.  Service was also friendly and quick.   Keep it up and this place will establish a strong reputation."}
{"text":"All their ramen is pork based. For someone who doesn't eat pork, this will suck for you as it did for me. I'm sure I'm an idiot for not liking pork but hey, more soup for you!  Have a great day'"}
{"text":"The service is good.  We ordered the Yokohama Style and Nishikawa Black ramen, the tastes of the ramen and the broth are alright, but the portion of food are small.  The ramen served with a big bowl but only half filled, it comes will two pieces of chashu and some small portion of other toppings, cost $11-12 a bowl, it is pricey for that little portion of food, and we walk out with hungry stomach after finish all the noodle and every drop of broth.  The most disappointed is the hard boil egg, it is not fresh and it is not hot spring type of hard boil egg (running yolk) which you will normally have served in any ramen restaurant.  Anyways, Good to try!  One star to the server!"}
{"text":"I ate here back in November. Pretty authentic and good portioned bowls/servings. Would come back when/if I'm in town again."}
{"text":"The chashiu is amazing there! And the ramen is awesome too! However, I think the place need more space and seats."}
{"text":"I don't get this. After walking out of the blazing trash fire that was the OTHER just opened Nishikawa Ramen north of this location in Phoenix proper I was in the area for this place and it's actually not bad. But still 1-star.  So I had the Yokohama Ramen (hometown bias, go Marinos) and a Chashu-don. I fully expected to get burned again.  The pork is of good quality ... it really isn't chashu rather than brisket but I'm not complaining overmuch. The teriyaki sauce on chashu utterly threw me off however. As in NO HELL NO. Some of the food and flavor choices are such that they'd never be made in Japan, and this is one of them.  The Yokohama Ramen ... without bok choy or any actual Chinese vegetables like menma it really isn't something out of Yokohama, it's a very light tonkotsu with normal chewy noodles found anywhere in Kanto. But I'll take it since they also have an oddball drink collection (ramune? What)  I'll come back again and work my way down the menu. Oh and Abby, thank you."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what is going on behind the scenes with Yelp here but I did review this place on their opening day and it was on yelp for quite a while but now appears to be wiped?  Regardless I will summarize my first experience here as horrible as they were just not prepared from a staff or food readiness perspective.  Because that was when they opened I have since returned twice and I'm happy to report that this place has ironed out quite a few kinks.  First, they have dramatically simplified their menu.  When they opened it was like an overwhelming build your own sushi style menu that while I appreciate must have been a nightmare to support in the kitchen.  Now they have a handful of selections and a list of \"add ins\" which should give everyone what they want without over-complicating it.   I had the Yokohama Style Ramen and the Nishikawa Black Ramen and must say I like both but prefer the Yokohama.  The Pork is tender and flavored very well and the broth is rich and full of layered flavors.  The addition of spouts give a nice crunch as does the green onion.  The noodles have a perfect bite to them and the texture is spot on.  I got the extra noodles and I was stuffed after finishing my bowl so the portions are generous.  The aroma is nice and there is no gameyness that you might find in Chinese based noodle soups.     I can honestly recommend this place now if you are a noodle person like myself and love ramen. On the down side the seats at the bar are not the correct height for the bar top. You feel short no matter how tall you are and I am 6'5\".  I would recommend the tables and booths instead for a more comfortable experience."}
{"text":"We ordered pick up and it was a flawless experience. Easy order, fast, and most of all amazing food!"}
{"text":"Even though I'm originally from San Francisco, living in Phoenix for the past 15 years has made me a cold weather wimp! Every time the weather drops below 60 degrees, I put on a million layers and go on the hunt for steamy bowls of ramen or pho. We got to Nishikawa at around 7 pm last night and were seated immediately. They have about ten tables and a long countertop; it was definitely busy but the staff were super nice and efficient and turned over tables really quickly. They're planning to close December 20-31 for renovations, so unfortunately a few of the menu items were not available when we visited; this includes soft boiled eggs for the ramen, bummer!  The tonkatsu ramen was delicious! The pork broth was rich and hearty, albeit a little on the salty side. Luckily they do bring out carafes of ice water to your table, because the soup was so good I couldn't stop going back for more. The straight ramen noodles were al dente and definitely a good serving for me, though if you're a big eater you do have the option of ordering extra noodles for $1.50. The pork chashu was tender, though a whole lot fattier than I'd prefer. I'm a huge fan of pork belly, but the chashu here was easily more than 50% fat. I do love that they have pots of chilies on each table, so you can customize your bowl to your spice level. I'll definitely be back to Nishikawa; hopefully the renovations will add some new gems to their menu too!"}
{"text":"This is the most authentic ramen you will find in all of Phoenix, hands down. After traveling to Japan several times, I recently moved to Phoenix. Eager to find something that resembled the ramen made with such passion like back in Japan, I found myself continuously losing hope with every so called \"ramen shop\" in town I tried. Trying what feels like every ramen shop around, from bland broth (Tampopo) to ramen with toppings with ADHD (SoSoba) my hope dried out like the dry pork bellies that caused it to become void.  Until....two days ago.  This gem, this diamond, this glorious almighty savior of ramen in Phoenix had opened to ignite that light of hope in me.  With the first sip of the Tonkotsu ramen broth, I closed my eyes and was instantly transported back to the streets of Shibuya. The complex flavors danced around in my mouth like a melodic symphony. I wanted to run to the chef and on my knees bow down to him for providing me this gift, this taste, this feeling, of being right there, back in Japan enjoying ramen made with passion and love.  After I came back down from this ecstasy, I moved on to the noodle; incredible! (I was told by the waiter were made in house. (Again passion!)) Then on to the pork belly; succulent! Then to my ultimate test, the egg...ace! Oh man, those flavors, the layers intertwining with one another, the complexity! I was not let down!  If I ever want to make a quick trip back to Japan for some ramen, I'll start my car and drive 12 minutes down the road.  Gochisosama Deshita!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good! The portions are really big so I hope your hungry. If your looking for a good ramen spot this is the place."}
{"text":"Our go to ramen place in Phoenix! Their broths are thick and flavorful with the perfect toppings. Service is always great and prompt. My bf is also a fan of their karaage."}
{"text":"They have a Yokohama Ramen on the menu .... anything named after my hometown is actually supposed to be Chinese (the regional delicacy is shumai dumplings, the sort you find in dim sum. Sold in bento sets on long long Japan Railways trips) ... but I digress. After the toxic waste dump that is Tampopo, I was excited to find a another ramen place even though I had NO idea who Nishikawa was (it is a common surname). The equivalent for an American would be to find \"Johnson Burgers\" in Recife or Pattaya which then begs the question ... Nishikawa who? What?  So I ordered the Nishikawa Black, a set of pork gyoza and some spicy garlic edamame, which should be a representative selection.  This place uses extra thin noodles typical of Nagahama Ramen ... which is a very fine flour noodle that absorbs flavors readily but is very easy to screw up because it's only supposed to be boiled for 90 seconds or less, which is typical of Kyushu ramens like Hakata ... very fast serving times with chewy, full bodied noodles. Not at Nishikawa where the noodles were completely OVERBOILED on arrival. The pork cut is a nice touch, the kikurage and nori are excellent. and the broth is supposed to be tonkotsu ... but it is stupidly weak and I can taste kombudashi so is this RAMEN or SOBA?! I've had better INSTANT ramen.  Seriously this place is authentic HOW? The basic sake collection headlined by Shochikubai, the Rolling Rock of the sake world? The Okinawan beer (Orion) no one on mainland Japan drinks? The Maneki Neko in the corner with the upraised left paw telling me with its eyes \"I don't want to be here, help?\"  I am betrayed once again by another one star disappointment in Japanese food in Phoenix, but I'm used to that by now. The food scene here is overall very good EXCEPT for Japanese of ANY kind. The search continues for Japanese comfort food in this state which DOES NOT SUCK."}
{"text":"Excellent flavors and service. The gyoza was spot on. Prices are reasonable and food was fresh and fast."}
{"text":"First and foremost I have lived fairly close to this restaurant and had never gone. Needless to say it was a long overdue review.   I will preface this by saying I love ramen and this cuisine and Nishikawa did not disappoint. The only reason it gets 4 stars from me is because I have had some of the best ramen in Las Vegas and so far nothing compares.    It is in a good location with open parking and visible from the street. So easy to find.  It has ample seating and friendly service.  Not a long wait. Granted I went on a Sunday night.    The appetizer was delicious and very tasty. The ramen itself was cooked well and the taste was very good. It had a lot of flavor and the meat was tender. Matter of fact the pork was so tender and juicy that it was falling apart. One of the better ones I have had.    Overall very tasty. Very delicious and reasonably priced.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff, slightly small dining area but cozy. We sat at the bar which was nice except that the chairs about 4 inches below the bar so makes it slightly difficult to eat out of the bowl that contains hot broth... food is overall tasty, recommend ordering take out rather then dining in."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The ramen broth is amazing and they make they're own noodles, which makes it so much better! We tried three different ramens and all we're great! Plus the servers are so nice! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"The chicken karaggee was tasty, the ramen was decent to average. Felt like the ramen portions were small. I would return however wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Nishikawa Black.... yummmmm I think I've drove past this place a million times and tonight I decided to stop! What a great decision that was. Arigato Mr. Nishikawa.... You make a delicious ramen and your boy Scott will be returning soon.  It's actually a quiet little place to enjoy a delicious bite to eat. Two thumbs up from this guy"}
{"text":"Nishikawa Ramen (?? ????) is a pretty recent addition to our valley's ramen scene located on the southwest corner of Ray and Cooper. I've been here twice now. First time I tried the Nishikawa Black - the noodles were a little odd - not your standard ramen noodles and the broth tasted a bit too salty. I also had the takoyaki which was alright. The second time I came for the Tonkotsu ramen. The broth was a little weak but the noodles were a lot better this time and made for a much more satisfying meal. No big deal - Tampopo doesn't quite get the tonkotsu broth perfect either - best tonkotsu in the valley IMO is Dozo Izakaya - but it took them a few years to get there. Place has a cozy atmosphere - I've been coming on the off hours so I'm not sure how crowded it gets during peak lunch hours. For decorations they have little Doraemon dolls in the display case at the front entrance and an Ichiro Suzuki Seattle Mariners jersey framed on the western wall. Thank goodness we now have other choices than Republic Ramen. At the edge of a strip mall. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Great little place. Nice atmosphere and clean. Clean food. You never feel heavy or laid down here. I've tried just about everything in the menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a regular place for us... when we want reliable, solid food this is a place that we always consider. My go-to dish is the Miso Ramen and it's always great. The service is solid. Really great value for your dining value..."}
{"text":"Fantastic and authentic food, from the appetizers to the ramen... so Japanese. Atmosphere is not authentic, but the real deal here is the food."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations.  Tonkatsu ramen, Katsu and Spicy Tuna bowls were delectable."}
{"text":"Place and food was great . Friendly service and clean. Location looks out of place but don't let that fool you ."}
{"text":"Delicious! The service here is great and the Ramen is delicious. I'm always satisfied and full when I leave. There seems to be a lot of people there who look like they've been eating Ramen for years and years so that's a good indication of good Ramen to me!"}
{"text":"On a 7 day crave for Asian noodle soups I've come to this place as much as twice a day- lunch and dinner!! I ordered the Nishikawa House Black both times. This $12 ramen dish comes with a pork broth, chashu pork belly fat (that are a bit on the very slim side), nori dried seaweed, fried onion bits, green scallions, kikurage ( wood ear mushroom) black sesame seeds, black garlic oil and of course the seasoned egg. The broth base consistency was thick and just right. It's a soup for the soul especially for cloudy rainy days.   Their tonkatsu ramen $9 is another popular favorite minus the black sesame seeds and garlic oil;  as well as the \"moving\" takoyaki balls $7!! Menu is limited but selection is good enough to be content."}
{"text":"Went twice within a week, even after telling myself I wouldn't return bc of the service and extreme kitchen delays/misfires during the first visit.   Both times, the ramen was excellent. With our most recent trip, my husband and I agreed it's the best ramen we've had here in Arizona--and it's the closest to our favorite spots back in Hawaii where great ramen exists everywhere!   This time around, the service was extremely pleasant and accommodating--huge huge HUGE improvement from just 5 days prior.   Thank you Nishikawa Ramen for making things right and implementing quick changes to not only improve your business, but overall provide a better restaurant experience. We'll be regulars!"}
{"text":"So far my friend and I have been here twice and the food is bomb. They're probably the only Ramen place I feel comfortable experimenting with new dishes in. My friend absolutely loves the Nishikawa Black and I usually get the Tonkotsu. They both come with a hard boiled egg I probably wouldn't otherwise touch at another restaurant but Nishikawa makes it look irresistible. We both have tried the Miso ramen as well and that was really really yummy with thin noodles. The kikurage is one of my unexpected favorite parts. 11/10 will eat again!"}
{"text":"I get that this place is relatively far.  We all wish it was closer to something tangible, instead of out in a strip mall in east Chandler surrounded by cookie-cutter homes that contain a ton of transplants from the midwest that would sooner eat at an Applebees for the millionth time than ever try something \"ethnic\" (you all know these people...they're terrified to travel more than 3 miles away from their subdivision lest they see actual city life).   But there it is, an oasis in a bland desert.  And it's pretty freaking good.  That Nishikawa Black ramen (oh, add a soft-boiled egg.  Do it now) is fantastic.  Garlicky, rich, velvety broth and good noodles, with plentiful accoutrements make this probably the best bowl of ramen in Phoenix to date.  I dunno, maybe I haven't tried every place yet, but I've tried enough to know that it stands above at least everything in the East Valley. Republic Ramen is barely a step up from instant...actually I doctored some instant Shin Ramyun the other day that came out better than Republic.  If it wasn't for college girls in yoga pants going there it'd be out of business already).  Tampopo is pretty great and their execution is probably a little more pure than Nishikawa, but it's missing just a little bit of the flavor Nishikawa gives.  Ramen Dozo is a good new contender too but I have to try it again.  I know people love Umami but it's still a little too...meh...for me.  Hachi Ramen is more authentic too but their tonkotsu is so rich that it takes on some of that inner marrow smell that pork broth can get, too gamey for my tastes.  Basically, Nishikawa is worth the drive because it trounces at least everything in its general vicinity (and I still think it's the best bowl in town, period).  If not though, there might still be a TGI Fridays somewhere for you."}
{"text":"Great place is enjoy a delish bowl of authentic ramen. Staff is friendly and service is quick. Shout out to one of the waitress, Bea, she was kind and considerate. Gave me enough time to decide which ramen I should get and was informative when I asked questions. Will gladly come back for more delicious ramen!!!"}
{"text":"Chinese owned Japanese Ramen place.  Decent ramen place. It is bit expensive for what you get. But its delicious and close by my house .   Highly recommend their appetizers too!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place every morning and evening, on transit to work, since Sept 2015.  The food here is fantastic. I have had the bowls and appetizers. Enough for a small lunch.  When it gets cooler here, will try a ramen bowl."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times in the past two weeks and we will keep coming back.  They have a small but well-executed menu that is quite tasty.  I have tried a different ramen each time but so far I think my favorite is the Curry, or maybe the Spicy Tonkatsu.  My wife and I also quite enjoy the pot stickers and karaage chicken.  This place fills up fast at dinner hours but they do take reservations."}
{"text":"Very tasty!! Even though it was super busy and we didn't make reservations, we got seats at the bar. Pork gyoza was SO good! Miso ramen was also amazing night and so filling. I wish they had other drinks beyond sake and beer."}
{"text":"First time ever experience Nishikawa, and I must say I'm impressed! The atmosphere can satisfy either the regular foodie, or cultural seeker for authentic Japanese ramen. The selection is consistent, yet simple. And of course, the ramen is fabulous. My only complain is the pork tended to have more fatty deposits then I like, but regardless, it's a place I would recommend to anyone as a first time, or regular ramen eater!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for an early dinner. We were immediately greeted and had the freedom to choose wherever we wanted to sit. We sat down and menus and a jar of lemon water was brought to us immediately. My partner wanted gyoza so we ordered the pork gyoza as an appetizer. Our waitress asked us if we wanted to order now or if we needed a minute, we told her we needed a minute and she went ahead and put our appetizer in the computer and told us she'd be back in a couple minutes to take our order. I decided on the Tonkatsu ramen and my partner decided on the miso. We both ordered extra noodles cause the pictures online didn't look very big, it was later found that one order of noodles is PLENTY.  Our waitress brought out our pork gyoza and it was the best gyoza I've ever had. Just perfect. Our ramen came out not long after and they were SO GOOD. Mine did not need any soy sauce or salt or anything. It was perfect. My partner added chili powder in his miso but that's because he likes spicy food and he loved his as well. Great place and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great ramen! Tasty and balanced broth. We had the straight homemade noodles. Noodles have great texture. Overall, we are very satisfied with our ramen!"}
{"text":"I'm posting this review to help Nishikawa out so they can ready for their grand opening. This is not in anyway going to be riddled with profanity and judgement like another poster but something constructive and helpful to the staff. For the record, I have worked in the service industry through high school, college, and now as a Registered Nurse.   Husband and I came on Monday around 1pm. We had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated. There were 8-4 tops and 12 seats at the bar. No one seated at the bar, 2-4 tops open. We were given the menus which were abbreviated versions of the one online. The one online was still a work in progress with template instructions still there. So we were given water without is ordering which was great. It was 100pm by the time we started to order. We ordered takoyaki first. By 109pm we were told that they stopped serving ramen after \"a certain time.\" The time wasn't really sure by our server. So we ordered the rest of our food. My husband ordered the karaage donburi and I ordered the chicken chashu donburi. We could hear the servers tell other patrons being told that they didn't have ramen anymore. There was some guy who was seated at the bar way after we arrived that somehow got ramen. A dish came out that looked like our takoyaki but the server said it was something else so we passed it along to the other table only to have it brought back to us as takoyaki. Yes, it was takoyaki. My husband liked it. Then his bowl came out. I had to wait for my bowl long enough to sit and stare at his food, go to the bathroom, do my thing, go back to table and watch one server bring 2 bowls to another table. Still had to wait another few minutes for my bowl. Finally got it. The meat was warm, not hot. It was pretty fatty. I was thinking this was not right. Gave a piece to my husband. It was pork. I don't eat pork belly a lot. Appetite gone. At least, the rice was hot. Anyone with religious, allergies or adversions to pork with a temper probably would have thrown a huge stink. I'm not the temper tantrum type even after the strike outs so far. One server came to see how things were. I told her that I believe that I was given pork rather than chicken. She asked if I was told that they ran out of chicken. No, we were not. They did give us a free drink of green tea (matcha not tea bags) for not having ramen. With a lost appetite, I asked for a box since I wasn't going to finish my bowl. It was already after 2pm and people were still trying to come in that were turned away. The servers and the manager/owner? ended up locking the front door. We paid our bill and tried to leave. Nope, staff can't get the front door open, we left through the side door. The thought went through my head that we would have to go through the kitchen.   So right now, I hope that Nishikawa will read these reviews and make some positive changes. The owners should consider allowing their servers to write down their orders so there is no confusing tables. The sign by the front door should say they ran out of ramen and other things. People should be told that they ran out or stopped serving ramen before being seated. Other Yelpers were offered giftcards to come back. We were not, so the incentive is very low right now. We will give it 3-6 months before going back. By then, the kinks will hopefully be worked out. I look forward to trying you again."}
{"text":"The best Ramen I've tasted in Arizona. The restaurant environment was very intimate and clean. We were seated promptly and got there right on time beating the Sunday dinner crowd (a little before 6 FYI). We were provided a little pitcher of lemon infused water. When our waitress was made aware this is our first time she provided us with solid recommendations and accurate portion sizes for the non ramen bowls. Additionally she gave us time to think over the menu and we were overall satisfied  with how the workers handled the incoming crowd. We ordered takoyaki and it was presented beautifully with the sauce and toppings classic for the warm balls of goodness. Our ramen followed (Nishikawa Black). Make sure to order extra meat. The first sip of broth made me fall in love with it's perfect balance of creamy and liquid goodness. It wasn't too salty so I knew it wasn't instant. The meat fell apart on the chopstick sand melted in my mouth. Noodles were very soft and non mushy. We were excited to find how well the broth and noodles complemented each other. All the other Ingredients such as the seaweed, egg, mushrooms and shredded red pepper brought together the bowl making it a truly authentic experience. I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants the non instant ramen experience"}
{"text":"Just got into town and looked up best lunches in Mesa. Didn't disappoint. The Blackened and Miso were great. The Pork Gyoza was also very well executed. Great spot for $30 for 2."}
{"text":"One of my favorite! Best ramen in town! Friendly staff, amazing miso ramen! Definitely the right place to be delighted and blown away with amazing quality food!"}
{"text":"What a great place! The food is delicious, decently priced, and the staff are kind. It was only a matter of minutes after we ordered our food that it was sent to our table. My kids even enjoyed their dinners!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant via Yelp and gave it a shot. The staff is friendly and the location is convenient. The men's bathroom could be cleaner. (People often judge the general cleanliness of a place by how clean the bathrooms are). The food portions were OK and it tasted fine.  The cleanliness of the restaurant seating area seemed OK. I'm not sure if I would return. Nothing against them, but I think I would rather try some other places."}
{"text":"Tried the new ramen restaurant near our home. It was yummy. Thank you to the two guys sitting next to us @the bar for getting our tab. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Congrats on opening the new location. We came in and were seated promptly. Our waitress was a complete sweetheart! Service was great because we ordered and our food came out about 5 minutes after. The broth and food is as amazing as the Chandler location but even better now that it is closer. Very authentic Japanese ramen and highly recommend the chashu pork and soft boiled egg. We also tried out their house green tea and that was really refreshing on a hot summer day. We overall had a great experience :) We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"my friend and I walked in 50 minutes before closing thinking we had more than enough time to order and eat but, the kitchen was already closing up and half the stuff on the menu was not available. I was very disappointed and on top of that the service was awful. Could not get the waitress to give us our water, because she was too busy talking on her cellphone. NOT the work phone. Overall experience was not pleasant and I am not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This place is great. The customer service alone makes the experience magnificent. The ramen was served with great presentation and Temperature. Love that they leave a container of cold water on each table so people can serve themselves if they chose a spicier ramen. It appears most of their ramen are available with some spice control. I personally like my ramen extra spicy and they were able to accommodate that for me! If it's not got enough or if you're particular about how spicy you want it they have the spices used available for you to personalize it once it's at your table. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went back again. 3.5 stars. I'm not ready to give out that 4th yet. I've had better ramen elsewhere. However the broth is MUCH improved and doesn't taste like drinking grease. And the service is night and day better than first time. Not bad for a neighborhood joint and I would go back again."}
{"text":"The ramen is good the service is good too. Their server is like the Tasmanian devil she's all over the place but still cheerful I'd comeback here if I come back to Arizona"}
{"text":"Love this spot! The ramen is delicious/full of flavor and my personal fave is the Yokohama style ramen. The Chicken Karage is great as well!"}
{"text":"This place is so friendly. Our waitress greeted us as soon as we walked in. Ordered some appetizers and their crispy fried chicken is so good. I got their regular Takamatsu ramen with extra meat and their soup is very savory. Serving size is quite allot so if you don't eat allot, one bowl can be share with another person. Service was great. She explained the menu very clearly for us. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to for ramen. I've gone to a few more upscale places in downtown Phoenix and chandler and none have compared to this place!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there and the food is definitely authentic but the taste was different. I remember liking the flavor of the noodle but the soup base was new. I would definitely go back to get a second opinion and try something new. Our server was nice."}
{"text":"This is one of the many ramen places we have in AZ and I think it's pretty decent. You have 2 noodles to choose from which is perfect because it's straight and curly noodles. I prefer curly 100% of the time because of its slight chewy al dente texture. The broth is good, and the huge thick cut chasu pork atop is good, it includes a thick layer of fat and skin too if you're into that. I recommend getting a chicken karaage to share."}
{"text":"I was excited for this Ramen restaurant to open.  However, there wasn't much flavor to the Tonkotsu ramen.  The pork was in large pieces that were difficult to eat with chop sticks.  Additionally, the pork had a lot of fat on the edges that I had to eat around.  I may go back to try a different dish, however, if the pork is not in smaller pieces to eat and without fat, it will still be a disappointment"}
{"text":"By all means the the most flavorful ramen in the valley. There Yokohama and miso ramen are amazing. The broth and noodle are awesome. I wish that the eggs were cooked to order, I am not a fan of cold hard boiled egg in my soup but everything else is great. I love their totoro case and casual dinning atmosphere. The wait staff is friendly and obliging."}
{"text":"The gyoza is amazing super close to authentic Japanese gyoza. Ramen is good but the broth is a bit too creamy/thick. Will definitely be back though."}
{"text":"Super delicious! Everything was on point. It's a small place but it's arranged so that your not cramped feeling. Had tonkatsu and miso ramen,delicious? Pork was good noodles are thicker than I'm used to but really chewy. Wish we lived closer."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Karaage (Sp)  along with the Salmon and Spicy Tuna bowls.  Terrific food.  Definitely will be back for more and I'm looking forward to the Ramen that everyone is talking about."}
{"text":"The meal was nice and good presentation. I think it was a bit much for me, but others may like this place. The bowls look nice and hearty though."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place! I saw it on an FB ad and thought to try since it's very close to us. The broth delicious! A very hearty, yummy bowl of goodness. Service was great, place was clean and organized. I am very curious to try their rice bowls as they're really affordable. We also tried their takoyaki appetizer and loved it. Cannot wait to come back to this place and try other things."}
{"text":"I had to try this place because of course.. ramen! But I got the regular miso ramen, while my boyfriend got their most popular (I can't remember the name) and it was super yummy! The broth itself was full of flavor and it felt fresh. A good Americanized version of pho I feel like! I am super weird about meat and even the pork chatsu was delicious minus the fatty pieces which my dogs loved. Super easy ordering on yelp eats and quick, fast and friendly"}
{"text":"I'm used to eating ramen in Little Tokyo in downtown Los Angeles in those ramen bars where you can watch the guy hand pulling the noodles, so maybe my expectations are a bit high.  That being said, the fam and I were craving some ramen and found this place on Yelp. The reviews were ok, so we gave it a try.  Wait staff is great. Really nice. Attentive. The do a great job.  Atmosphere is a little strange. You walk in and it looks like a typical mom and pop Japanese restaurant (counter with stools, a couple tables and 4-5 booths.  But then there's this outdated hip hop music playing throughout the restaurant. I like hip hop, but not when I'm going to a Japanese restaurant with my family to eat ramen. Kinda kills the whole relaxed vibe expectation.  Anyway... menu looked good. They had all the typical ramen stuff. They also had some interesting looking appetizers. One was Takoyaki, described on the menu as \"Ball-shaped Japanese snack made of a wheat four-based batter filled with octopus.\" We like octopus, so we gave it a shot. It was pretty lack luster to say the least.  There was some odd creamy filling in the center with literally 2 tiny pieces of octopus in the middle. Wasn't expecting \"creamy\" anything based on the menu description and definitely wanted more octopus.  We also ordered tonkatsu and nishikawa black ramen dishes.  When they arrived, the first thing I noticed was a giant oil slick in my bowl. I came to the conclusion that this was chili oil because I ordered mine spicy and chili oil is what they use for the heat I suppose. After a few spoonfuls of the broth, my lips and entire mouth were covered in oil and it didn't seem to go away, which pretty much ruined the whole experience.  My wife's tonkatsu was slightly less oily since she didn't order it spicy, by she commented on the oiliness too.  The eggs in the ramen were cooked perfectly. The chashu (pork belly) was pretty good. Noodles were ok, but clearly not freshly made. This place just missed the mark a bit compared to other ramen places we've frequented in the past.  Probably won't go back but good luck with your dining experience there."}
{"text":"I have been here couple times and had the curry ramen. The first time it was really good. The second time my soup was really thick and salty. My husband had to pour some water into the soup or else he can't eat it.  Maybe the soup was old?  I still think Dozo is better in Tempe."}
{"text":"Good authetic taste ramen is not easy to find and this place come close to it. Reasonably price considering the portion. Place is a bit small but I like the ambiance. Waiter was friendly and attentive.  I'll def be back."}
{"text":"Cherry Blossom was the only acceptable valley spot for ramen ... until now.  Now I have another place to indulge my broth-y, noodle love. And not just that, but their gyoza have that crispy, lacy, browned bottom I never get in Phoenix.   What it lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in flavor ... and I only go to places like this for the food anyway. Like no one is going to be taking their hot date here, but you'll come with the person you can sloppily slurp noodles with. That's kind of a lesson about life for the kids right there. If you're afraid to suck on some long, sauce covered ramen noodles in front of your date, why are you so willing to suck on other things?   It makes sense."}
{"text":"Found the place on Yelp, and looked forward taking my husband and my mother in law here. But turned out this place being the BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT ever, I've never given a one star to anything anywhere but WOW.  1. The pictures here showed the eggs are soft centered, but THEY ARE NOT. And obviously they don't tell you you have to request soft boiled egg???  2. The four of us ordered Miso, Shoyu and Tonkatsu ramen, and the color of these different ramens are all the same????? HOW? The curved noodles are HARD, DRY and all coiled together. And the straight noodles are just SOGGY.   3. The biggest issue I have is with the servers attitude. The Miso Ramen was way too SALTY for my mother in law, so we asked for a hot glass of water to add in to her broth. The server gave me this ANNOYED LOOK when we asked and when she brought the water this is what she said to us: IF ITS TOO SALTY YOU SHOULD TELL US YOU WANT IT LESS SALTY.   WTF?! How are first time customers suppose to know your ramens are that salty? I don't believe real or all ramens are over salted?   NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Although I ordered my meal as a take out order, I will definitely come back and try to eat dinner inside the restaurant. However, if you would like to carry your meal out, you can either call your order in, or you can try to yelp and another app to order.  Since I can't speak on service and presentation at the restaurant, I can write about the food! I ordered spicy ramen tonkatsu and it was delicious! I really appreciated how they separated the broth, noodles, and meat so that it wasn't soggy when I got home. The toppings and additions to the ramen are delicious! The noodles are soba and taste fresh, compared to most ramen places. The amount of meat that they add is very generous! Rather than the typical thin slices, the pork pieces are a little thicker and a little fattier than most places, but still very delicious!  I really liked the toppings and noodles! They add this delicious type of mushroom and green onions. It does come with an egg, however it is just a typical hard-boil style egg, rather than a 3-5 minute, soft center egg. Although the menu does not have the ramen as spicy, it is an option that you can add, which I highly recommend if you like spicy ramen!  I also ordered a side of the porky gyoza. It comes with a delicious citrus based sauce, almost like ponzu or a mixed of ponzu with soy sauce/other type of sauce. It was packed on a small bed of lettuce with a lemon wedge, which was a surprising flavor that worked well with the gyoza. The meat filling was not very salty and it was perfectly balanced.   This is definitely a place to try! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been craving ramen for the last week so I decided to give this place a try on the recommendation of a friend. I ordered the shio ramen with extra char siu and a soft boiled egg to-go.  The business is just a little hole in the wall on the end of a strip mall. There were only a few tables occupied when I got there around noon.  The staff was friendly and quick to get my food ready. I really like that they pack the broth and the toppings separate and you mix them at home.  I've had takeout ramen from other places that mix them and the noodles end up soggy by the time you're able to eat them. The ramen itself was delicious. The broth was a little salty for my liking but still very good. It had a creamy, silky texture with strong pork flavor. It was a little oily but that's expected.  The char siu and soft boiled egg were cooked perfectly. This is the best soft boiled egg I've had (they also have the option for a hard boiled egg as well). The noodles were thin, straight noodles but they have another variety you can substitute. First impression, this place is great. I cant wait to try the other ramens and some appetizers at this place."}
{"text":"broth is very flavorful , noodle is perfect , best ramen in az."}
{"text":"First of all, I think Nishikawa Ramen is a 4 star ramen place if you have to compare it with just the ramen in ARIZONA. I honestly think it is a lot  better than most of the ramen I've had here, including the ones in top notch Japanese restaurants in the valley. If I were to compare it to the ramen in LA, it wouldn't come close to 4 stars. I still thoroughly enjoyed my meal nonetheless.  For the ramen, I was told the Nishikawa black was the tastiest one but I opted for the tonkotsu. It was good; it was definitely on the salty side. The pork was fatty and tasty, not as tender as I would like it to be but it was not bad. We also had the beef bowl which was excellent. Our server warned us that the meat would be fatty. It was so good and tender. I couldn't believe that it only cost us $5.  I will definitely be back to try the other ramen styles."}
{"text":"First time here. Their speciality is of course Ramen. We ordered the Nishikawa Black and a Yokohama Style.   The main difference is the broth and the noodles. Both are really good.  We ordered the Takoyaki and the Chicken Karaage.   Got to give this place a try. I love it. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service, clean place, filtered water immediately upon being seated, followed by food from the Gods! I had the Miso ramen and it was fantastic. The broth is obviously made with care and time, and is rich and creamy. The noodles are dense, but perfectly cooked, and it was served with a pork chop sized piece of pork and your choice of soft or hard boiled egg. It was garnished with green onion and corn. I can't recommend this place enough, delicious! This will be a staple for me and my family, and the kicker? After tip it was $12.00!!"}
{"text":"We love RAMEN and Nishikawa did not deliver at all.  The noodles have an odd taste, very wheat-like and grainy tasting.    They are also thinner than regular ramen noodles and clump together.  The broths were also not what we expected at all. The tonkatsu broth looked exactly like the shio broth.  Both had a very earthy taste.  If you want good Ramen go to Umami, as this place does not even come close."}
{"text":"Alright this place is one of the best Ramen places in AZ that I have tried! Coming from San Diego I fell in love with Ramen and this place makes me feel like I am back in CA. I would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"The food was great. I ordered the Tokayaki which came out first. It was made in house, which was nice. However, 30 mins later the ramen came out. Really, does it take that long to make ramen? Also, the service was sub par. The whole service took 1.20 hours. They really need to get it together on the service part. Otherwise, the food was decent. I would return for the food, but please get it together on the servi"}
{"text":"Similar to their location in Chandler, the ramen is as authentic and delicious as you'll get in Phoenix, rivaling Hachi for best ramen in the valley.  The only difference from the other location (other than an upgraded interior) is now it's within a short drive from midtown, which is a vast improvement from the lengthy drive to East Chandler."}
{"text":"TLDR: Average Ramen with great service  Dropped by here the other day because it had decent reviews. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that the smell was a little off. It kind of smelled faintly of wet rag but it dissipated (or I stopped noticing it) after a while.   I was waiting for some friends so I sat there for about 10 minutes without ordering. People started piling in at that point but the waitress was really nice and didn't try to pressure me at all about ordering like some places do.  My friends got there and the waitress was very nice about our orders even though all of us had some specifications (tip: their default egg is hard boiled, you have to ask them specifically for the soft boiled one if that's what you want.) My friend asked for 3 eggs (she's an egg monster!) the waitress was very helpful and told her she was welcome to call her back if she wanted more eggs (she did). After our meal we stayed there for about another hour having very obnoxious conversations but they never once pressured us to leave or order more. They kind of got that we just wanted to chill there so they didn't bother us.  Overall, I liked the atmosphere there and the food is good enough that I would go back."}
{"text":"Was so excited to hear about this place! Ramen is my favorite food and I was a little disappointed with the other ramen places around, so a new place is always fantastic. We drove 30 minutes to get here, and luckily we were seated at the bar immediately and given water and menus. There was a lot I wanted to try, but both my boyfriend and I settled for the original tonkotsu ramen this time, with some karaage as an appetizer (even though it ended up coming after our ramen, haha).   It took a little while to get our food, but once it was received I was very pleased. The broth looks pretty oily but the taste was very good! The chashu was delicious and my boyfriend said the egg was \"the best,\" so he was happy that I let him have mine too!   The noodles were undercooked for both of our ramen, but it didn't bother me--my boyfriend's noodles, however, were severely undercooked and pretty chewy. It's a new restaurant, so we let it slide, because everything else made up for it! The karaage was also perfectly cooked and delicious. I'm a little bummed I didn't get to try the gyoza this time, but I'll definitely be trying it next time! Worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Favorite ramen in AZ now has another location! Nishikawa Black has been a favorite flavor. Pork belly nearly breaks by chopstick. Would want more hot broth to eat it a little longer."}
{"text":"This place is such a delight! The servers were very friendly and the food is to die for! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Reviews about service being bad doesn't apply anymore, they've significantly improved.   Nishikawa black is awesome.  Everyone is super nice.  Authentic ramen, love it!"}
{"text":"Great food. I lived in Asia for 4 years,and this is the closest to authentic that I've found."}
{"text":"I love the Salmon Bowl, a great choice for those who love raw salmon, and the Katsu bowl is great for kids or those who are shy about Asian food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Noodle spot in the east valley, enough said!!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place when I was visiting my parents in AZ because I was craving some ramen.  Came in around 1:30pm or so, there was maybe 2 other groups there, must have just missed the lunch crowd.  Sat down, the waitress asked our group if we have ever been there before.  We all said no.  She responded ok, hesitated, and followed up just ask me if you have any questions.  If you are going to ask if we've ever been there before, at least follow up with recommendations.  Anyways, I got the miso ramen and the pork gyoza.  The miso ramen was extremely salty, I wasn't a real big fan of it.  The pork gyoza was fairly good.  It was flavorful and both soft and crispy.  I'd recommend it.  Overall, it wasn't super great, and it wasn't super bad.  I'd probably give it another chance when I revisit Arizona.  Hopefully it'll be a better experience."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of my friends checking this place out so I decided to check it out as well since its the closest ramen place to my house. I've been to this location before when it was a sushi joint so I knew it was going to be small and was expecting a line but surprisingly we got seated pretty quickly. That was the last thing to be quick though because the service was a little on the slower side but that didn't bother me too much since we were having sake bombs to kill time. I got the Nishikawa ramen which was pretty good in terms of overall flavor but like another review said the broth was becoming gelatinous which I thought was because it was the last bit of broth since I know you have to cook down the broth a long time but maybe its something else. One of the guys I came with got a salmon donburi but he was pretty hungry and the serving did not satisfy him so he got a ramen as well which left me salty since he got a ton of chasu with his bowl and I only got a piece and their chasu was really good."}
{"text":"Great stuff! Flavorful! Would come back! Fast service! I had the house black ramen and it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"This ramen is the best in AZ for me. I had Nishikawa Black and it was the real ramen which Japanese like. I'm sure I'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"It's my first review for yelp, and I definitely want to gave it to this excellent ramen spot in Phoenix. Quality and authentic ramen! Service was fast and friendly. I traveled to Phoenix for a week and went there twice. I'm a big fan of ramen, and I love their broth and curved noodles so much! I tried so many others and I didn't like that much. I ordered spicy Tonkotsu ramen with soft egg for first visit, and signature spicy Nishikawa black for second time, and they're just perfect for my appetite. I added a lot sides in my ramen and made it a colorful looking. I let them took out the chashu for me this time because their portion size is too big for me. I definitely want to try more food here once I travel to Phoenix again. I heard they already have two restaurants in Phoenix area. I hope they can open more in other cities, lol~ btw I never heard any ramen shop called Nishikawa, I thought it's super cool()  Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen with soft egg, menma, kikurage, bean sprout, green onion, dried seaweed, fried onion and black&white sesame seed.  Spicy Nishikawa Black ramen Spicy with black garlic oil, soft egg, menma, kikurage, bean sprout, green onion, dried seaweed, fried onion and black&white sesame seed."}
{"text":"I just don't get the bad reviews.  This is an excellent ramen joint.    Fried squid was very good.  Chicken Karage excellent.  Pork Belly rice bowl, again very good.  Nishikawa black oil ramen was so great and great value.   Any complaints of serving size is utterly false.  These are filling bowls of ramen - the broth is authentic.  They make their own noodles.  In the valley, we can't be this picky when there are so few authentic options.  This restaurant could hold it's own in SoCal."}
{"text":"Sooooo I've definitely been back, a ton. No sign of our ditzy waitress!   I had to show this place to my husband because the food is just absolutely amazing. He lived in Japan for some time so he is pretty picky about his ramen. This place is his new favorite place to eat! Since we came the first time we have probably been back about six or seven times in the last few months. We just can't get enough!"}
{"text":"This place SUCKS. The people worked here has no energy at all , I felt like i walked into a grave.  The soup has so much oil inside and it's not even Ramen noddle, they are using soba noddle and call it ramen.  I was so surprise those people who put good review for this place,did they ever have real Japanese Ramen noddle before? and just few small pieces meat inside for 11 bucks.  I had great Ramen in CA, its nothing close at all, I havnt eat any of my noddle and end up paying 40+ dollar for my bill, no service at all, I wont come back to this place for sure"}
{"text":"First time here with a friend and it was quite a drive for me coming from the west valley but the ramen was worth it. We each ordered ramen but different styles and the  ramen was excellent, the broth was flavorful, and our noodles were perfectly made and perfectly cooked. The difference in flavors between our two orders was subtle but still noticeable.   We also ordered sides and I thought I'd be adventurous and try the takoyaki. Not what I expected and I couldn't eat them after trying one. The waitress gracefully took them back and didn't charge me for them, which I thought was nice. I then ordered pork gyoza which were delicious as well as the chicken karaage we ordered. The chicken was moist and tender. Nice little quaint place with very good food aside from the takoyaki but I'm not a fan so that's probably just me. The ramen made the drive well worth it."}
{"text":"The Nishikawa Black Ramen bowl is LIFE CHANGING!  Hot is def. hot and will clean sinuses for sometime.  A+ hands down AWESOME food here-- a must try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic amazing ramen!  Nishikawa Black is my favorite..Yokohama is also amazing.. The broth is so succulent and flavorful addictive! Spring rolls and Chicken and Pork Gyoza appetizers are also a must try! Staff is top notch owner Jay ..cook Jeremiah and server Allison will go above and beyond to make your visit as memorable as possible!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! The ramen is really top notch. The pork broth in the Nishikawa Black Oil ramen bowl is rich with lots of flavor and spice. The pork cutlet is a very large portion and oh so tender. The soft boiled egg was perfect. The service is great, fast and friendly. Best experience I've ever had for ramen. A++++"}
{"text":"Best ramen in the valley. I've been to Japan several times and this is where I choose to go when I'm in Arizona. I've tried a lot of ramen places and they just don't compare."}
{"text":"Wow this was some amazing ramen! Menu is small but everything is good, quality over quantity. They don't skimp on the portion size either, lots of noodles. Best seasoned egg I have ever had."}
{"text":"Very delicious Ramen. There are many options to choose from and they have mini bowls with meat and rice. Very great staff and great dishes."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner and have been talking about trying for a while now. We were a bit deterred since all the Ramen options have pork and we don't eat red meat. Did takeout and just ordered the Ramen sans meat. If you're a true vegetarian they do offer a vegetable broth but I had the Tonkatsu, pork broth, no meat, soft boiled egg, and requested as spicy as possible. It was delicious and they delivered on the spicy! Spicy yet flavorful as opposed to just setting your mouth on fire. So sorry we haven't tried sooner but thrilled we found a new go-to takeout just two minutes away!"}
{"text":"Very sloowwww service; they need experienced staff to run this place; ramen was waayyy too salty and the boiled eggs were still raw inside; we know what authentic ramen should taste/look like - what they serve is not even close. We shared our thoughts/experience with the manager. He provided us with 2 free meal coupons, but we won't be back. Ramen is too far off from 'authentic.'"}
{"text":"Went to Nishikawa after my girlfriend and I went to the OdySea Aquarium. The food was amazing, the chicken gyoza and the Nishikawa house black (I believe that what it's called) was amazing. Staff was very friendly too. Definitely going to come back again. Thanks Nishikawa!"}
{"text":"We found our new ramen spot. This place is amazing. 12 minutes from our apartment in downtown Phoenix. We found it on Yelp and had to try it out as our bellies were growling for some delicious food past normal dinner time on a Saturday night. We got to the restaurant around 9pm and there were two to three other tables. They left as we were ordering. At the time we were the only customers. The server took our order and even asked what we'd like to have on the TVs. The gyoza arrived first and very quickly. I got the pork gyoza and they were perfect, soft yet crispy in all the right places. The ponzu sauce for dipping was delicious with multiple flavors happening at once and the green onion giving it that bite. The two bowls of ramen arrived shortly after. My wife got the tonkatsu ramen with the housemade noodles. I got the miso ramen. The broth was so full of depth and richness. The flavor was amazing. All of the ingredients inside worked together so well for your typical miso ramen. My belly is so full and happy. The service was amazing and so was the food. We'll be back for sure to earn our free bowl of ramen after scarfing down ten bowls."}
{"text":"Incredibly yummy! Awesome and attentive staff, Amy made the first experience very welcoming . I had the pork Gyoza which was crispy on the bottom  delicious filling, and had a great sweet soy sauce on the side. I also had the Pork ramen bowl with added black garlic oil. I was not disappointed, Pork was juicey, broth was killer, and the noodles were prepared just right. It's a small and cozy place and I will be back!   P.S. I love when places give you a jug of water to pour myself"}
{"text":"Dropped by the place after a rigorous day outside. Didn't have their beer permit yet but the ramen was amazing."}
{"text":"The ramen here is pretty good and probably the best we've had here in the valley.   Unfortunately, what I witnessed with one of the workers may have possibly been a health code violation. She was refilling the water bottles that each table gets. As she was refilling, she dropped the top on the floor, and put it back on the bottle to be served to patrons. She also used her bare hands to guide ice into the bottles and in the midst of this activity, went to go get some paper for the receipt roll and then preceded to go back to touching the ice without washing her hands. I also noticed the ice scoop resides inside the container for ice, with the handle and all.   The employees could use some FDA food code trainings. I don't know what else is being done in the back where there is no one to witness any violations."}
{"text":"NishikaWa has a very decent bowl of ramen. I had a spicy miso which is really good. I've had better Southern California but not bad for a valley option.  The service was prompt and ambience was great when it was early dinner time. I am sure I'll come back here every once and while when I need to fix a ramen craving. Very nice place!"}
{"text":"First time here tonight! Spicy Yokohama style ramen was full of flavor! I'm picky with ramen but this place was great! Will come back again."}
{"text":"Best Ramen I've had in the valley.   Everything I've had here is 5 stars and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"First time I've had ramen noodles other than what I make at home--a fancy version out of shin ramyun package that I buy at Asiana market. I always put egg and green onion! Was a pleasant surprise to taste these noodles. They were delicious! I added medium spice, which was perfect. No runny nose or watery eyes. Chicken gyoza was perfectly fried and the dipping sauce was not too salty. Great service and a small, friendly atmosphere. Space is limited, so I'm not sure how dinner is, as I was there during lunch with no wait, but it was almost full. I told my mom that it was both a good and bad thing that I found this place; good that I loved it, bad that it makes me want to cheat on my low carb diet haha. Definitely try it if you are craving a gourmet ramen bowl!!!"}
{"text":"My review is based after having no luck getting in during the soft opening with the previous menu and getting in after they reopened.  I loved the food. I am happy to go back for another round soon and order some new stuff that I didn't before. I had my friends with me and I had the pleasure to taste the miso, spicy, and tonkotsu broths. I loved all of them and I'm excited to try out the black ramen next. There is still some growing pains that are happening, but if they keep it up, I see only great things coming from here.   I'm just hoping that they'll be able to expand their menu eventually since I saw Tsukemen as an offering before they had to trim down the menu. Also, my friend wished there was other broth options if that could happen. All broths are pork based and she's generally a fish/chicken person. For me though, that pork broth was close to sensual for me."}
{"text":"Read the reviews, so we came to try this spot on a Friday night. There was a little wait to be greeted at the door and before being sat but it was well worth the wait!  it's a pretty tiny spot, so, I WOULD NOT recommend for larger parties.  Also an FYI, the bar is open seating.    The business is new and I understand we all need to catch our flow, the food however made up for the wait! We had the chicken karaage, nishikawa curry and black... And WOW. If you love ramen as much as I do, the black had so much depth and so much flavor.  The curry was just as good!  There is a star in both of these, and that's the little jar on the table with the garlic chili flakes! You must put in your soup.  The chicken karaage had a peanut butter ish dipping sauce that was pretty awesome as well.  All in all, we'll definitely be back... Maybe not a weekend night tho."}
{"text":"*4.50* Best ramen I've eaten in Phx so far. Started with some apps: chicken kara age, geso, and tako yaki. Kara age was nice and crispy, geso wasn't bad either, but compared to the motherland (Japan) would have preferred the thicker legs, tako yaki was as expected (we asked if they were freshly made the traditional way, but no). Still they were presented the traditional way and tasty. More importantly all the apps were served hot! The tonkotsu ramen was just a little to oily for my taste. Nonetheless still had bold deep flavor! Wife and my son had the black ramen, great flavor again!Daughter had the veggie ramen, soup was a little bland but hey it was veggie. Would I go back? You betcha!!! Thanks Nishikawa Ramen."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent visitor to the original Nishikawa location in Chandler...being addicted to the house Nishikawa Black Ramen. Today I ventured to the new central Phoenix location on a work outing. I must say that the quality didn't miss a beat. They pulled off the exact same high quality as always.  That being said, this place has earned my admiration and its time I take the time to honor them with my full opinion.  If you love Ramen or have never tried it (or only know of the instant packets--like me until I saw the Netflix Chef's Table episode on Ramen which put me on a mission to find a great place), just try this: go into Nishikawa (either here or their Chandler location), order the Nishikawa Black house soup and prepare yourself for an experience as good as the 20+ hour stewing broth and house-made noodles. The pork belly in the soup is melt-in-your mouth and I just love the soft-boiled eggs, the flavors are so deep and savory. The pot stickers are fantastic, served with some bright ponzu sauce. I also love the Takoyaki...fried-dough dumplings with octopus inside, covered in a sweet mayo sauce with shaved smoked fish. You will love these.  To sum it up, if there was a national competition of Ramen by city, let's say we'd want Nishikawa to be representing the Phoenix metro area. Tampopo in Tempe is a strong 2nd. But they are bit more expensive, lack a comfortable seating environment (you have to be in college to find it suitable) whereas Nishikawa offers comfort, and their overall Ramen flavor is a degree behind Nishikawa's (props to Tampopo for taking the time to make their own noodles in-house too and that is why they and Nishikawa tower above the other Ramen places around)."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC!!! Great find. Food is fresh and absolutely amazing. Will for sure be back many, many times."}
{"text":"I really like the Nishikawa black. And the chicken appetizer along with the gyoza. My only complaint is when taking to go, it seems like there isn't enough broth. I do wish they had more dishes that are family oriented like a rice bowl or something of that nature. There are always people here when we stop in. On certain days, it definitely gets busy with just the 8 tables and like 6 barseats."}
{"text":"I've been in here twice now. One bowl was amazing, and the other was good, but not as good as the other. The one that wasn't as good was my first stop in, so it was good enough to bring me back - then the second bowl (the one on the bottom of the menu with black garlic) blew me away. So delicious! I haven't tried any of the sake yet, but there seems to be a good variety. The chicken gyoza (potstickers) are also quite yummy, as we got them both times. If you're looking for noodles in Chandler, this is an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"They state they're open until 9:30, however, we arrived at 9:10 and they told us the kitchen was closed. They state they close \"early\" and told us we couldn't be served and that yelp needed to update their closing time. This was a giant disappointment and we were treated very rudely. When going back and asking what time they actually close the kitchen, we were told 9:15. This is very confusing as we arrived before either time. We even offered to get take-out as to not disturb them, but we were again refused."}
{"text":"While not quite true authentic Japanese style Ramen like you get at Monta's in Vegas, it's the best tasting Ramen I've found In the Valley of the Sun.  I find the owner very personable and honest about his attempt at making Ramen. He treats it as a work in progress and a constant learning process to find the right balance and above all ... consistency.   Practice makes perfect ... stop by and take a taste of the young masters craft!"}
{"text":"Great Japanese food. I like the ramen very much. They are delicious. Also the place is very chill.  Very recommended. I will go this place more often with my girlfriend and friends. One of the best Japanese food in Arizona."}
{"text":"Really glad another great ramen shop has opened in the valley. I've been here two or three times and haven't been disappointed yet. The Black Garlic Nishikawa Ramen is my favorite! So much flavor, and I love that the extra noodles are less than $3. Their takoyaki is also very good! I constantly crave this place and feel like I should start coming here oncr"}
{"text":"Definitely \"meh\" in pretty much all regards.  Place smelled odd, kinda dingy feeling and the food was average.  They need to make their own noodles like Tampopo to even stand a chance to compete at that level.  That being said, I just have no reason to return here where I go to Tampopo nearly every week for consistently AMAZING ramen that rivals even locations I frequented in NYC and Amsterdam."}
{"text":"This place was a little disappointing in terms of their food. The food was very salty and I couldn't even finish the food. It looked good and the presentation was good but the taste Didn't match the food and presentation that was in the bowl.   I don't think I'll be back at this establishment again nor will I recommend it to anyone. I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Yes.  It's good. It's authentic ramen. It SMELLS right. Smell is important! They're prompt, ean, and professional while still being super friendly and guiding people through choices and offering recommendations.  Worth five stars. Easily."}
{"text":"I loved the decor of this place as soon as I stepped in, immediately to the right of you will be a case of awesome Totoro and Doromon figures! Then everywhere you looked they have my favorite versions of the lucky cat, with the smiling eyes.  Anywho, on to the food! We ordered calamari, takoyaki, toankatsu ramen and nishikawa black.  The broth for each noodle entree were the best I've had for ramen in Arizona, the noodles how ever were just alright.  The takoyaki was delicious, though watch out because they're VERY hot in temperature with the first bite, I was a bit disappointed that they weren't more crispy on the outside but I'm impressed by a restaurant that even does this well of a job on this appetizer. The calamari however was a different story, the flavor of the calamari itself and the sauce was awfully lackluster and the breading fell off instantly when dipped, the only thing that saved it was their great spice mixture at the table and the lemon that came with it.  Overall it was a lovely experience and most of the food was quite delicious, great customer service also. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Got the black ramen but replaced the menma (bamboo) with corn. It was really delicious, and the Chashu was really good. But the seasoned egg was closer to hard boiled, and I think it may have been a little expensive. It was $13."}
{"text":"We drove from Glendale to eat at this place. This place reminded me of some ramen shops in Cali. The ramen and takoyaki I ordered were phenomenal. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite ramen place in or around Phoenix. I've had every one of the ramen dishes so far and they were all pretty fantastic. If you want something spicy I am a huge fan of the curry ramen. Service has been quick and friendly every time and I've yet to be disappointed by any of the food. Not very expensive, usually around $10 per person. Would recommend for anyone looking for a ramen noodle dish or simple rice dish."}
{"text":"OMG!  Delicious and authentic.  Satisfied my craving for authentic ramen soup!  Now, I know where I'm going to eat! And they have a sake meter of sweet to dry.  The Yokohama Style Ramen is superb with the seasoned egg.....and know you can get the egg soft boiled to perfection. They have tapas, donburi, ramen, and sake. I highly recommend this restaurant.    No Sushi here."}
{"text":"I love japanese food and tried many places. This place taste exactly same as japan. Why would I say that bc I lived in japan 6years. I love here and I will keep coming. Im so glad my friend bring me here."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. I had the tonkatsu ramen and it wasn't anything special. The server was super nice and attentive. The price was average. The food came out super fast, which was nice because we were hungry. But the tonkatsu ramen noodles were a little soggy. I love that they have curly noodles and straight noodles. And straight noodles are definitely my preference, so I appreciated that. The meat were fairly small and pretty salty in comparison to Tanpopo's and Republic Ramen's. I have yet to tried the takoyaki, so we will be back."}
{"text":"Cute little place..  Service was good.  Our appetizer was tasty and the ramen was ok.  I am not sure how they compare to the area since we are new in town.  We are somewhat picky on our ramen which is why it only got three stars.  All in all it was a good dinning experience."}
{"text":"I convinced my husband to drive me to this location from North Phoenix based on Yelp reviews. As a former Angeleno, I've had my fair share of ramen and sought something to curb my craving. I can't even describe the sadness I experienced when I bit into my beautifully plated ramen. I had such high hopes for the Black Ramen that I ordered.   The Nishikawa Black had one piece of pork, that was beautifully cooked, but un-trimed and hella fatty. I expected more that one piece for $11.95. The broth was overly salted and tasted of pepper. It almost hurt my tongue. The saddest part of this disaster in this bowl full of lies were the noodles. They were not ramen noodles. They were thick undercooked soba like noodles. Seriously!?!  I ended up pushing my bowl to the side and ate the takoyaki that I ordered as an appetizer. It arrived after my bowl, so I made it my dinner. The takoyaki were actually well made, hence the two stars. I had such high hopes for this place, but don't let looks fool you."}
{"text":"Great Ramen less than a mile away?! For me, at least- YES!!!  Super flavorful pork broth (I had the Miso Ramen to go). Good portion size. I love their noodles but also wish they had a gluten free option as well. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've never had real Japanese ramen before but it was delicious! I got the Tonkotsu and split the karaage and pork gyoza with my friends. The waitress was very kind and made sure we were well accommodated.  I will definitely come here again in the future!"}
{"text":"Came in on a friday just before 6. Service was prompt. I ordered the nishikawa ramen and my husband ordered the katsu bowl.  The food took half an hour to come out and I could see into the kitchen and it looked like only one guy was working but upon leaving I saw another.  Seems the kitchen can handle the restaurant at capacity?both the dishes were delicious but no surprise with the price of the donburi being so cheap rife meal was too small.  Unless you are a child order 2. If it weren't such a long wait for food he would have ordered another bowl."}
{"text":"We were traveling here for two days and we came to eat in nishikawa twice. The delicious Ramen with the soup is the best choice for the dry weather here. The warm and friendly environment is a plus. We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"No 5-stars yet but I was impressed with my visit this past week and trying the black ramen combination.  There is much more on the menu that I will sample upcoming!"}
{"text":"Nice little place. Service was great, ambiance was great, and most importantly, the ramen was good! Not too badly priced. Takoyaki is definitely something to try while you're here. They have recommendations if you just ask!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this another try, but the Yokohama Style Bowl was awful.  Hard noodles, fatty pork, small portion and worst of all the liquid/soup was not edible.  I hate to give negative reviews, but this is warranted.  The staff was friendly, and interior was quaint. Not sure if this is authentic or anything close. The other dishes looked appealing."}
{"text":"I've been back to this wonderful little restaurant about a dozen times. The food is excellent -- definitely try to Nishiwaka Bowl. I've taken lots of ramen lovers here, and they all keep going back, too."}
{"text":"We just can't find anything about Nishikawa to speak bad about. This place is rockin' the noodles"}
{"text":"Been here two different times. We've tried 3 of the Ramens on the menu. The tonkatsu, shio and the nishikawa black. The tonkatsu ramen was very good, I added corn to mine, which is totally worth the extra dollar. The shio ramen is too salty and the nishikawa black was very good. We also ordered the salmon bowl which was just salmon, seaweed salad on top of white rice. The gyoza definitely seem like the ones that you can buy frozen and they just pan fry it and add green onion and sesame seeds. The ramen is definitely worth the try if you're craving it!"}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had since being in Tokyo. Broth is Rich and full of flavor. Egg has a proper soft boil."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week to get the best noodles in the east valley and we are never disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was the best ramen i have had in a long time. the portions were perfect and the pork melted in my mouth. the table had a bowl of chili powder that was perfectly suited for my broth. the ginger was tender and juicy. the service was remarkable and very friendly. i will tell my friends about this place and continue to come here."}
{"text":"I really love their Tonkasu ramen! The soup is thick and creamy. The noodle taste fresh without the starchy feeling. I came back from Japan this year and I would say they are not bad comparing to what I had in Japan. Other appetizers are good too."}
{"text":"So I'm not too sure how to rate this place I mean the staff and customer service was great but the dish I ordered was just not my thing. Appetizers were really good we had spring rolls and pork dumplings. My husband had the vegetarian and I had the most expensive thing on the menu 'it was recommended by my waiter ' but just wasn't my type of ramen noodle. Atmosphere was cool small little hole in the wall did get packed definitely not for a large crowd."}
{"text":"The people are awesome and the ramen is just as amazing! It was my first time trying ramen and I couldn't imagine it being any better than this."}
{"text":"Got it delivered through Grub Hub and it was still hot and delicious."}
{"text":"FINALLY a ramen place has opened in our area. A real ramen place. Not just a noodly place that has ramen in the menu. Having lived in the PNW where you can hardly swing a curved noodle without hitting a ramen joint, this place is the real deal. The menu offers a few types or ramen with a concise choice of delectable side dishes. We have eaten here twice in a week and will make this place one of our regulars. The broth is flavorful and the portions are just right. I will say that if you ask them to spice it up they bring it! I asked for medium spice the first time and it was a tad too spicy for me and I love hot food. However, they have a nice shaker of ground chilies on the table so order regular and add your own. We will be back...tomorrow!"}
{"text":"We had exceptional ramen here! Great portions and the server was very helpful with suggestions. It should be noted that as of the end of June they are still pending a liquor license. The description implied that beer & wine were available but that was not the case."}
{"text":"Really cool spot that looks the way a ramen place should.  The staff was crazy friendly and it wasn't that busy even during lunch.  I sat at the bar and had the pork gyoza and a pork ramen dish.  The gyoza was maybe the best I've had in the states and the ramen was good, not great.  The ramen wasn't exactly what I was expecting as the \"original\" dish, so I may try another option next time.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We were excited to hear that a new ramen place was opening up so close to home but very hesitant to stop in because of all the reviews about service and running out of food items. We tried when they first opened but was met with locked doors and told they were closed due to server training.   We got in about six and came in right as a few tables were leaving. Server was very nice and pretty attentive at first. Unfortunately over the course of our meal service quality dropped dramatically. Our ramen came out in five minutes and about ten minutes later we got our appetizers. Three tables came after us and our server never dropped by again. There were two servers and we struggled to get anyone's attention even in the small 8 table restaurant. Our waters were never refilled and when it came to getting our check we waited 20 minutes before we could finally get someone's attention to bring it. Although very nice but not necessarily a deal breaker cause service quality can always change.   As for the food - definitely worth it. We ordered the gyoza, takoyaki, nishikawa black and spicy miso. Takoyaki came out nuclear hot but was a little too soft in the middle for my taste - still very good. I preferred the nishikawa black over the spicy miso but my husband liked the miso more.   If you're patient with service definitely a must try cause the food speaks for itself. We'll definitely be back but maybe not during peak times or maybe after they figure out the service situation."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and I ordered the black ramen- the broth was over seasoned with what tasted like white pepper- could not have much of the broth due to this- perhaps I had my hopes too high - a bit disappointed"}
{"text":"It's not the best Ramen compared to some really good and authentic Ramen places in CA, but pretty decent in Phoenix. We had Nishikawa black, edemame, and takoyaki."}
{"text":"nishikawa has the BEST ramen!  the broth is very tasty.  i usually order the yokohama ramen with a soft-boiled egg and extra pork chashu.  you will not regret coming here.  the service is also fantastic; they're very kind and friendly."}
{"text":"First time here, fantastic service & the miso ramen was awesome. The portion size was perfect for the price. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new ramen place in my neighborhood and read all the great reviews on yelp. Bonus that this place makes their own noodles. I had the tonkotsu broth, which was delicious, though not as thick as I generally like it. I asked to trade the pork chasu for another egg (I don't care for big pieces of pork) and they would not allow substitutions. Traditionally, ramen is highly customizable, so I was surprised by this. They were willing to remove the pork, but not replace it with a lower priced egg.   When my food arrived it looked and tasted great! However the \"soft-boiled\" egg was so hard that it was difficult to cut, even with my spoon. My stainless steel water glass had black spots on the inside (it may have been rust?) so I did not drink any water. The service was pretty good, but because of the dirty glass, over cooked egg, and no substitutions, I could only give 4 stars. I would definitely go back, but next time get the curved noodles and I would bring my own water bottle."}
{"text":"Every place I've moved I've been in search for ramen. In NYC I was spoiled by Minka, Kambi, Ivan Ramen, and Ippudo. LA has countless great places. This is it for Phoenix. The black garlic option is so yummy with great umami yuminess. The noodles also have a great classic texture. The ramen here is more traditional than  the one I've had at Cherry Blossom. We also had the fried chicken and gyoza which remind me of good night market street food. I plan to become a regular."}
{"text":"Living in Phoenix, I usually get my ramen fix from Cherry Blossom just for being closer to me. I've tried different places in Tempe, but nothing compares to the ramen in Little Tokyo in LA.  Nishikawa's ramen is definitely one of the best in the valley, the flavor reminded me of a tiny restaurant in LA called Mr Ramen. I ordered an original tonkotsu, the broth was super rich, but the noodles... were perfect! al dente, not soggy and bland like other noodles.  I also ordered takoyaki, and this is by far probably the only place that has decent takoyaki. Phoenix residents are hungry for takoyaki, the good stuff, not what we can get during the Japanese Festival in February. I also want to add, I really enjoyed listening to Japanese music in the background, the decoration gives the place the mom and pop restaurant feel. Customer service was excellent, we were very surprised at the end of our meal for what they did for us when the check arrived ;) Thank you Chef! Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great service and awesome ramen!!!!   Will be back and get take out too. Potstickers were also the bomb!"}
{"text":"It was alright.  We ordered 3 appetizers that I had to ask for after we got the ramen.  I'd skip them next time since the ramen was filling enough and way better than the apps."}
{"text":"Went here with friends last week. Wasn't sure the place was open because even though it was 600pm, the parking lot and dining room were completely empty. Menu is divided into ramen, tapas, and rice bowls. For me tonkotsu is the benchmark I use to judge any new ramen place and we also decided to order some pot stickers and chicken karaage, but when approached by the waitress we were informed that they were out of half the tapas, including every type of pot sticker and the karaage, so we ordered takoyaki instead. The takoyaki arrived and was obviously not fresh made.  Fresh takoyaki is always rocket hot from the process of making them.  These were only slightly warm on the outside, warmer in the middle (microwave?).  Tasted fine but could not find any discernable octopus. The tonkotsu was milky white as it should be, but not the least bit fatty so it didn't stick to anything as it came out of the bowl. The noodles are the same dried ones I buy at Lee Lee and there was 1 little sad piece of pork on top. No reason to ever go there again when Tampopo is about equal distance for me and there is so much great Asian food I have to pass in Mesa to get there."}
{"text":"It is nice to have a ramen house in the neighborhood. The place is very clean, the servers are pleasant and know the menu. and the food is oishii-desu (DELICIOUS!!). Potions are nice on the rice bowls and appetizers, and large on the ramen bowls."}
{"text":"After sitting in the restaurant for the first 3 mins, I have a slight suspicion that the owner could be non-Japanese.  Even though the restaurant has a Japanese name, but the decoration just seems very Chinese to me.  But who cares we are here for the ramen right?  Wrong!  The ramen here isn't what Japanese ramen supposes to taste like.  If art of making ramen is seeing as a religion in Japan, this place has officially offended the ramen God. The soup is overly oily and the noodle & meat don't have the right texture.  And please do stay away from the curry ramen (my son accidentally ordered it), it tasted like something that belongs in a Cantonese restaurant. With that said, takoyaki is certainly enjoyable and the egg that comes with each bowl of ramen does make up for the overprice & below average ramen soup.  And the service is good.  However I'm happy for people in Chandler/Gilbert that we finally have a ramen place to try, but unfortunately it just isn't the authentic kind.  So if you are well traveled & know your ramen please do me a favor and save your $10, because there is absolutely no reason for you to try this place out."}
{"text":"**4.25**  Came here on a Friday night.  Not too busy, bit of a drive from Gilbert. Seated promptly.   Food: Miso ramen: Pork broth, pork chashu, green onions, menma, Seasoned egg, curved noodles.  Spicy level is spicy (hottest they do). Pretty good ramen thus far that I have been to in phoenix.  They actually have the spiciness in the broth/ramen and not some chili flake add-on or hot sauce on the side type of deal. So off to good start.  Definitely preferred the CURVED noodle instead of the straight, just has more to it.  Overall broth had flavor and was good.  Perfect amount of food for \"regular hungry.\" You can always add noodles for like $2. So reasonable.   Downsides:  1. They forgot the egg (but they gave it on the side after we told them).  2. only 1 slice of chashu, (you can add on for additional price.) But I was expecting at least 2 slices or something. But the Chashu was done nicely. One of the better ones in phoenix.    Price:  $9.45 + tax for Miso ramen. Not too bad for ramen price.   Service: Friendly and fast. They did forget to put soft boil egg in both of our orders, which was weird as the egg wasn't an additional topping. It was included in the original ramen order. They promptly brought out both eggs on the side after we told them.   Parking: lot outside. no issue.  Environment: Medium size restaurant. More accommodating to smaller groups, more tables for 2.  Clean. Kitchen is open, so you can see what is going on."}
{"text":"My family and I were really excited to try Nishikawa but were extremely disappointed. We came in around 5:30 on a Sunday night and were sat a table for 2, despite having 3 people instead of being seated at a table for 4 because the \"dinner rush\" was coming -- this would've been fine except the waitress was rude in saying so, and there was a couple that had just been seated in a corner booth suited for 4?  My aunt ordered the vegetarian ramen, which was extremely salty and the \"vegetables\" that came with it were sprouts, onions and corn. We asked to sub one of the \"vegetables\" for spinach and was told it wouldn't be possible. The saving grace of the tonkatsu ramen was that the spice level was actually decently spicy. Although the ramen came with straight noodles and a hard boiled egg -- no traditional ramen shop would ever. Additionally, to add maybe 2 tablespoons of plain corn (not buttered, salted or anything) was $1.50!  Even the customer service was poor. We watched a family of 5 come in, and the waitress that greeted us told them \"We don't have any tables right now.\" and then walked away -- didn't ask if they wanted to wait for a table or anything.   Would maybe give them another chance, and would definitely make sure to have the curved noodles and a soft boiled egg."}
{"text":"Always amazing! Flavorful broth, well-cooked noodles, and the staff is really nice. I usually get mine spicier than typical; sometimes the broth is a little fatty tasting if I don't but I really don't mind either way. Definitely my favorite ramen place in Arizona!"}
{"text":"We got ramen to go. The broth and noodles were excellent. They definitely found a solid base. The pork in it was just ok.   Really good ramen though. I will be going back."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Missy Elliott - Get Ur Freak On)  Nishikawa!  Bo Bites be putting it down I'm the hottest around I told y'all Yelpers-ooh! Y'all can't stop me now  Listen to me now I'm trying ramens now And if you want to (Yelp-a) then come and get it now Do you want miso now? Then spicy-spicy broth I know you dig the way I re-re-view with Yelp (Holla) People sing around Now people read it now Now people try it now  Go, Nishikawa........   Nishikawa had a soft opening that was big news; needless to say I didn't they prepared well since the reviews came in and things were chaotic apparently!  For that reason I gave them time to recover.  When I finally decided to go with my buds they were closed to re-train their employees; good for them to be able to identify the issue and get on it right away!  When I was finally able to attend and they were actually opened; I was surprised from what I read to what I was experiencing.  I was greeted right away from the hostess and sat right away with a glass of water.  My buddy and I decided to start with an appetizer the Takoyaki; diced octopus stuffed in a flour-based ball and drizzled with sweet and thick teriyaki-like sauce.  Overall, I didn't care for it since it didn't have much texture aside from mush.  However, not to say I didn't think it taste good since I had the same in Japan.    We progress to order our ramen and my buddy went with the Spicy Tonkotsu while I shot for the Nishikawa Black.  My ramen came in a pork broth with pork chashu, kikurage, onions, dried seaweed, egg, black sesame, garlic oil, and shredded pepper.  Overall, a packed ramen, but the flavors they were able to infused was impressive!  If you like strong taste of sesame and garlic then this is your kind of ramen.  The noodles itself is definitely different from the store bought kind, but also very doughy in my opinion.    In the end, Nishikawa had a rough start, but I think as time progress they will recover they're lost and people and Yelpers alike will soon discover this gem and learn to appreciate it again! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's getting to the point of neglect if I hold off on writing a review for Nishikawa Ramen any longer, especially with the snazzy new interior renovations.   Nishikawa is my go-to ramen place in the Phoenix-ish (sigh that half hour drive) area, especially if I'm in the mood for curry ramen. The interior is neat and comfortable, and service has always been super nice if sometimes a little short handed. Parking is spacious and easy.   Available customizations for each bowl of ramen: - curly versus straight noodles, with straight being thinner and this able to be really saturated with flavor while curly has good spring and texture. - soft versus hard egg, with soft being superior in my opinion because of its gooey, liquidy center.   Curry ramen: This is my go-to here, and it's an off-menu item that's always been available each time I've gone. I always get this with straight noodles because I feel like they're a little thinner and are saturated with flavor, but thicker curly noodles with more spring are also available. The curry broth is great -- not too salty, not too thick, and piping hot in an oh-so-satisfying way.    Tonkotsu ramen: The broth is light yet flavorful, and I really like that it's not overly oily or buttery (I still can't believe some ramen joints put butter in the broth to make it creamier..). I can drink the broth without feeling like it's overly salty, and I also recommend straight noodles with this.  Nishikawa Black: To me, this is a saltier, more topping-heavy version of the Tonkotsu ramen. I've had it a few times and like it, but I find that curly noodles work better and I can't really distinguish the two besides this one being saltier. For that reason, I tend to just stick with Tonkotsu if I'm in the mood for pork bone broth instead of curry.  Miso ramen: I love the corn that comes with this version, and I do think the miso adds a nice depth of flavor to the broth. Curly noodles go better with this broth as well, although straight would be quite good if you don't mind a saltier broth.   Takoyaki: I've noticed that there generally seem to be two trends for takoyaki: either really soft and somewhat liquidy or rather firm and dense. I think there are arguments for both, but the version here is the softer, more liquidy version with a nice chunk of octopus in the middle. The flavoring is pretty good, and the order comes out piping hot (definitely be careful when biting in since the center tends to be much hotter).  Chicken karaage: Not bad, but nothing super special. The meat wasn't over fried but slightly on the bland side, and the dipping sauce was a bit watery for me.  Mentaiko bowl: I like this little rice bowl, and the mentaiko came with seaweed salad and ginger on the side as well. The mentaiko had good flavor, and I was a fan of the pairing with rice, seaweed salad, and ginger in a spoonful. There's quite a lot of rice, so I never seem to finish all the rice before the other ingredients are gone.  Hot and cold matcha green tea is offered, as well as some Japanese beers. There are little water jugs on each table, and I really enjoy the fragrant chili powder on each table as well.   I'll definitely be back to Nishikawa, half hour drive or not."}
{"text":"I'm such a fan!  Our Nishikawa Black Ramen bowl was everything I hope it would be in this chilly, rainy winter evening after a day spent hiking in the rain.  It was rich and deep, full of interesting flavors and textures and all the umami I dreamed of.    The spring rolls and gyoza were also yummy but the star of the show was definitely ramen.  It was soooo busy tonight, we were seated fairly quickly and our food came out fast.  Our waitress forgot our drink orders and didn't really check on us but I'm sure she saw we were busy slurping our noodles.  The restaurant is clean and small.  The prices are good!  If you're looking for a good ramen spot, go!  I'll be back soon.  It was incredible!"}
{"text":"WOWOWOWOW!!! FINALLY! After visiting Japan last year and being spoiled by the best ramen at every turn I have been looking to recreate the experience here in Phoenix. I had heard of Nishikawa Ramen but never had the desire to drive out to the east side and try it. I am so happy they opened a location closer to home. This is the closest to authentic ramen in Phoenix and I would say it's not far off from what I had in Tokyo. The tonkotsu broth is silky smooth and savory. The noodles are homemade and I may or may not have been slapped in the face with them because I was eating so fast! The pork chashu is generously portioned but you can add extra for $2. Clocking in at a whopping $9.95 it's a great deal. I've already been here three times in the last two weeks and I can't wait to try everything they offer!"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious... The gyozas are made to order, crunchy outside and full of flavor inside. Ramen are delicious too, add corn and more broth and you will be in heaven."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try this new place out. We've been to a few ramen places in California that were amazing, and wanted to find one close to home.  The atmosphere is very cute and really authentic. The staff is friendly and quick.  The only downfall is have to say is the tonkatsu broth was really oily and the noodles weren't like ramen noodles and were more like spaghetti noodles.   The gyoza was amazing, and the miso ramen my husband had was also amazing!"}
{"text":"Another ramen shop in Phoenix? I was so excited to try when I saw reviews from familiar Yelpers. A month after their opening, my chance to try finally came.  Unlike during their grand opening time, they were not busy at all. In fact they let me sit at a booth alone. I wanted to try pork bun but they said they took it out of the menu. So I tried takoyaki.  I just had real takoyaki in Osaka, their takoyaki is nothing close to what I had in Osaka, but I must say their takoyaki tasted better than I make at home.  As I ate my takoyaki, I must be doing something really wrong at home to make takoyaki.  Tonkotsu ramen was interesting. I actually liked their soup. It tasted more authentic than other tonkotsu ramen I had in the US.  What I didn't understand was their noodles. They look like spaghetti, it seemed as if designed to hold the texture of the noodle for a long time.  Most Japanese in Japan eat their ramen noodle really fast, less than 5 mins to enjoy that texture that will get soggy after 10 mins. So I learned to eat noodles really fast. Their noodles do not require you to eat that fast as they maintain texture for a while.  I just thought it was interesting that they chose to use this type of noodles.  Since I liked their soup, I would like to come back again, although it was almost one hour drive from my office after work.  Only after one month of their opening, they weren't too busy at all. I hope it was just that time/day when I visited they weren't busy."}
{"text":"This place is a neat little ramen place! It's menu is pretty straight forward. Ramen or rice. My husband had the ramen, the first one on the list and he loved it. I on the other hand had the katsu bowl. It was a tiny bowl and had a few pieces of chicken and a bunch of sauce on top. The sauce was a little too much for me but it wasn't too bad. The place isn't fancy, it's simple and pretty clean. Had a bar area and a few booths and tables around. It isn't a large dining area but enough for about maybe 20 people?? Overall the experience was pretty good. If you're looking for a \"I just want ramen or rice bowl\" meal than this is the place to go. Nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Our new fave where we have easily become regulars!  Love love love the Nishikawa Black.  This is the best ramen place I've ever been to!  A must try!"}
{"text":"It seems like ramen places are popping up all over Phoenix area. So far, all but two restaurants have failed to meet the standard of decent ramen in AZ. I just want more places that meet the standard to be in AZ so I don't have to drive so far for good ramen... I'm not even talking about being as good as California or Japan which have top tier awesome ramen. Anyway, it's all about the broth and noodles. I'm just going to be ramen expert here (it says so on my profile) for a second and judge the tonkatsu ramen bowl I had.  I appreciate that the egg was not hard boiled. So I'm glad they got that right. It wasn't running gooey soft (best kind) but at least it was semi-gooey. Another thing that I appreciate is that there were THREE pieces of pork in the ramen, and they weren't skimping on the meat like some of the other places. Might I add... the pork melts in your mouth.  Onto the broth! The broth is primarily the main component I judge when I eat ramen. Is it creamy? Is it thick? Does it have pork fat on top? Does it show depth? Can I taste the depth? So first, I would like to say that it meets the standards of good tonkatsu broth. If there was a minimum standard, it meets it! :) It's not the best when comparing to Japan or even California, but it is way above anything else in Arizona. It has flavor, a level depth and a texture consistent to good tonkatsu broth. (if broth can have texture hahaha). Sadly, no pork fat driplets floating on top of the broth. :(  The noodles were not soggy even to the end of the bowl. SOGGY NOODLES ARE BAD! So I'm glad the noodles didn't loose their structure. With that said, I'm not familiar with the noodles. I have gone through a lot of ramen noodle types but never came across this one. It is a hybrid between Lo Mein and Soba noodles. It didn't taste bad or anything. It was just different... (I seriously think it's thick buckwheat soba noodles).  With that said, I still think this beats all other ramen in the valley in terms of overall quality, toppings and broth even if it has the questionable noodles. There is a minimum standard and it's been met. The service was decent. Food came out pretty fast and the servers were nice. We also had the takoyaki (it was all right) and the fried tofu (tasted good, but more soft than fried). This place has potential to be top tier. I'll have to try the other ramen bowls to confirm that it can be top tier and potentially the best in the valley. So far... at least the tonkatsu is beating every other ramen shop in Arizona.  Actually, I am waiting for the tsukemen ramen which is not available yet in the restaurant. I don't think any other ramen or Japanese restaurant serve tsukemen ramen in AZ either. If they can impress me with that, I'll change my review to 5 stars. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is Soooooo delicious! Highly recommend the curry ramen, great appetizers... and the Green Tea is beyond refreshing and an experience in itself. You should check this place out!"}
{"text":"Delicious Ramen with vegan/vegetarian options! Love this place!"}
{"text":"My husband is an adventurous eater and took me here. I was skeptical but ended up LOVING it."}
{"text":"Tried this place because we saw the lower-star reviews were based on their soft opening (which I think isn't super fair but that's just my opinion) and I need my Japanese soul food fix. We got spicy tonkotsu and spicy miso ramen as well as chicken karaage. Chicken karaage was light and crispy and we loved the sesame sauce that went with it. The ramen had a good amount of spice that didn't overwhelm the flavor of the broth. Good amount of noodles as well! The waitress was friendly and service was quick. We'll definitely come here for our ramen fix!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Yokohama style ramen, the noodles were well cooked but the broth tasted a bit fishy. Some of the other bowls did read that as a ingredient on the menu, but the bowl I got did not so not sure why it had that flavor.   The pork was tender and tasty. The egg, in which I look forward to eating when I have ramen, was not soft boiled it was hard boiled. So when eating it in the broth it had a powdery consistency which was not so appetizing.   I did like how they serve you water in a carafe with lemon and ice and the staff in there were very nice."}
{"text":"Been here twice, so far so good! Oish?! I love the ramen with black garlic oil. Aside from ramen, there are great starters like the gyoza and karage. Even if it's over 100 degrees outside, you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"I've been patiently waiting for this place to open. So happy to have a ramen shop in the hood and this place did not disappoint. Ramen was really good. The service was good as well. Great alternative to other fast food restauraunt options in the area."}
{"text":"I was BEYOND surprised when I first tasted this. Also this being curry base ramen. Probs the best ramen Phoenix has to offer. I've tried a couple places- north of Phoenix and Scottsdale and was mildly disappointed with them. The taste just wasn't there. BUT THIS PLACE. Damn. All the flavor came out, strong and tasty. I love me some flavorful soupy ramen. They also said they offer 2 different types of noodle- straight and curvy. Try the straight, as I was told that's made in-house and is softer. But this place definitely hit the spot if you're craving ramen!! One thing I would add is that they only give you a piece of pork (if you get pork tonkatsu)... so maybe order extra meat if you're not carbo-loading. Idk I'm used to getting at least 2-3 pieces of meat in my ramen so that's just me.."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite ramen places in Arizona.  I always order the spicy miso, with extra broth.  I've taken a lot of my friends and family here and everyone has loved it.  I would stick to just the ramen if you go here, the other food is alright."}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars. I battled with this one for a number of reasons. The service was great. It's a small place, not many tables. There were a number of people enjoying their food. The saki was delish! We had cold saki and sipped. It was really good.   The ramen? I guess it just wasn't my thing. I know not giving a better rating because it wasn't my favorite is a bit lame but honestly, I didn't love it. Mind you, I am not familiar with authentic ramen. I love pho but this wasn't pho, it was ramen.   I skipped apps because I wanted to make sure I had room for my soup. Only, something about the fermented bamboo shoots threw me off a bit I think. The pork tasted good and even though it was fatty and the stock was fatty it was the bamboo that had a moldy taste... I get it, it's fermented, I like fermented foods, just not bamboo apparently.   I know shouldn't strike Nishikawa for my flavor palate but I am, sort of. I was surprised how disappointed I was after reading such great reviews. So, if you know you love ramen, maybe this is your jam? If you aren't certain, maybe don't go with the Nishikawa ramen bowl and try to have something with not as much in It?  I would recommend it if I ever heard anyone ask for suggestions but otherwise, it was a good effort on my part to try something new."}
{"text":"I was craving ramen even on a hot summer Phoenix day. The parking was easy with a lot outside. I was quickly seated. I ordered the Miso Ramen ($9.95). It came with the option of a soft or hard boiled egg. You can also order it with mild, medium, or hot spice. I got mine mild.   The ramen came out fast. The soup was creamy and I love having corn in my ramen. There was a little too much green onion for my liking. But overall, a great bowl of ramen for the price.   They give a carafe of water so you can refill on your own. I prefer this, actually. The service was super fast and friendly - definitely worth coming to!"}
{"text":"The best Ramen we ever have!!! Love it!!!!!!!! Tasty soup, ramen and wonderful service!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite ramen place!  Love all of them! The staff is so nice, restaurant is clean and atmosphere is great!  Food is always so fresh! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday.  Seating is a bit tight but I managed to get a seat at the bar pretty quickly.  I ordered their signature ramen and crispy tofu appetizer.  The tofu was delicious..it would be a great starter for 2 people.  The ramen broth was hearty with interesting, skinny noodles, accompanied by the typical toppings although my pork was a little charred.  (I'm not sure if that's what they were going for).  I could see this place in a Tokyo train station."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Service is always great and quick and the ramen is awesome."}
{"text":"4 stars does this place no justice! I have been looking at all kinds of different Ramen places in the valley and chosen this place.  My boyfriend and I had the Pork Goyza (4 stars!) we also had the Spicy Ramen with the curved noodles.  The soup had a very bland taste and the curved noodles were over cooked and stuck together.  To top it off the pork was a gray color .  I will definitely not be recommending this place or even give it another chance! Over all our server was very nice!  *** If you are ever in the area of Little Tokyo in California you have to TRY Daikokuya! Definitely 5 Stars!***"}
{"text":"I love this place and I go here quite often! I'd say this is the best ramen place I've had in Arizona thus far! I also go for the nishikawa black extra spicy. Just thinking about it is making me drool."}
{"text":"This food is incredible, point blank. I really enjoy ramen, but no other has been as flavorful as this. The Japanese mango cream soda truly hit the spot, and though it's not my cup of tea, the takoyaki was quite tasty. I plan on visiting again today and tomorrow just to endulge myself! If you like traditional Japanese cuisine, or are simply interested in it, or are a full blown fan of ramen, you owe it to yourself give this place a visit."}
{"text":"This is the spot!!! We got the Nishikawa Black and the Yokohama. Really good portion size and they were delicious. Service was impressive and the presentation was attractive.   We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this restaurant for a quick lunch. The atmosphere was very casual and the service was very fast. I was excited to finally try this place because I had heard so many good things.  We ordered the takoyaki and the black ramen. I was so disappointed when our food came and the ramen was salty and bland. The takoyaki was decent but nothing special."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the Ramen yet but the Poke Bowls are fresh and delicious. This is the best one in the area"}
{"text":"What a great little spot! Excellent service and maybe the best gyoza I've had. Short, simple menu- ramen, rice bowls, tapas. Everything was yummy."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of ramen and I've had such a hard time trying to find a great ramen spot since I moved from Los Angeles. Look no further than Nishikawa Ramen! I had the Yokohama style ramen which had a great pork broth with the curved Noodles that are made fresh. Reminds me alot of some of the top ramen spots in LA. Perfect and delicious! We also had the pork gyoza which was cooked perfectly and delicious. I'm a dedicated customer and will be coming back often"}
{"text":"Ordered: Tonkatsu Ramen with a soft boiled egg. NOTE: YOU HAVE TO REQUEST FOR YOUR EGG TO BE SOFT BOILED. Noodles were on the thinner side (for those of you who prefer thick ones). I personally like the thinner noodles. I wish the noodles were less well done, but again that's personal preference. The broth was thick and fatty...just as it should be. For being the first authentic ramen in the Phoenix area, I give it 4 stars. Is it the best ramen I've had? No, but this definitely hits the spot."}
{"text":"I've only had ramen a few times before so I'm definitely not a connoisseur but I thought this was pretty good. We got there about 12:30pm and were seated right away. The waitress asked us if we had any questions and then explained the difference between the straight and the curly noodles. We started off with an order of Pork Gyoza and Takoyaki. My favorite between the two was the Gyoza, although I wish both sides of the dumpling had been seared rather than just the one side. I ordered the Nishikawa Black Ramen and substituted the curly noodles for the straight ones. I also ordered my egg soft-boiled (thanks fellow Yelpers!) and I enjoyed it. I didn't find it too salty at all. I only ate half of mine and was able to take the other half home for lunch the next day which was a bonus. I'm sure I will return another day!"}
{"text":"Yummy, I enjoyed this place. My bowl was spicy and filling. The atmosphere was good and the staff friendly and knowledgeable. I only wish the bowls had more veggie options to add but I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and very open. Very quick as well will be back again. Any of the ramen is wonderful as is the Gyoza, loved the chicken"}
{"text":"I dropped by this place with my wife and given the 2016 award for ramen on the front door, I expected quite a bit. My wife ordered the original and I ordered the Nishikawa Black. Both of our ramen dishes came out with overcooked eggs (a worrying sign for us).  My Nishikawa Black came with a piece of Chashu that was cooked decently and tender but not melt in your mouth. I wish it came with more as the piece was not very large at all (given the price tag of the Nishikawa Black at $11.95).  The broth itself was pretty salty and very spicy. I was not really able to taste the pork broth itself.   I think the most shocking was the noodles themselves were not the typical ramen noodles that you expect, they looked a lot like soba noodles...  Overall, I think I'll have to continue my search for a good Ramen place..."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now.  They are our go to place for Ramen.  If you are looking for comfort food come here!"}
{"text":"A fun little place with great Ramen soup noodles.  Went during the lunch hour and was able to get a seat without any issues.  It's not good when a restaurant has too many empty seats over the lunch hour or way too crowded.  Nishikawa had a nice crowd but not too crowded.  Service was great and the food came out fast.  Started with the chicken gyoza and was delicious. Then I had the cha siu ramen.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. You won't hear that a lot from me, when it comes to Ramen here in AZ, but this one is.  The Ramen broth is very flavorful, as it should be when it's done right. Noodles are made fresh daily, not something premade or packaged.  The Takoyaki is also very tasty, with just the right flavors. Karage chicken is perfectly made.  However, the thing that I absolutely enjoy the most is the Charsiu (ramen topping). You will not find it made this way (authentic Japanese style) anywhere in AZ. At least I haven't yet, and I've been to many ramen shops here. The meat just melts in your mouth.  I will definitely be back to this one."}
{"text":"I was a little doubtful when we walked into the restaurant at 6pm on a Saturday and it was practically empty.  But Nishikawa was a pleasant surprise.  Many of the menu items are no longer available (ie: agadashi tofu, pork bun, etc.) which is disappointing since they just opened about 10 months ago, but on the positive side, the broth was in my humble opinion is THE BEST IN THE VALLEY.  Wasn't a fan of the straight noodles as they were a bit soft, but the curved noodles were excellent.  The gyoza were great as well as the miso ramen and the black ramen.  The pork chashu bowl was mediocre and they were out of the pork tonkatsu bowl.  Two thumbs up for Nishikawa.  Also, they have a secret Japanese Beer menu - ask for it if you like imported Japanese beer."}
{"text":"best ramen in Arizona! great service too i love the atmosphere here. The half boiled egg is the best I've ever tried including what i tried in Tokyo. Also, REAL TONKUTSU soup is the key to delicious ramen. The soup is rich and tasty too."}
{"text":"The service was ok but the food was horrible.  Those who are familiar with authentic Japanese ramen should run away from this place screaming. I've eaten ramen in many places in several countries including Japan and it's one my favorite foods,,,but this time after my wife and I ate less than 1/5 of our respective bowls we became quiet and very sad. I had never imagined that any food especially my favorite dish could give me this much depressing effect. Whenever visitors from Japan ask me if there is any foods in Phoenix which they would never be able to find or taste in Japan, and then I would proudly claim it's Nishikawa Ramen."}
{"text":"This is the closest to authentic Japanese ramen you can get in Arizona. The broth is hearty and the noodles are made fresh daily. We have visited at least four times and they never disappoint. Each time I have ordered different dishes, but they all tasted delicious. I would recommend ordering the Nishikawa Black."}
{"text":"Ramen was overpriced for how unflavored it was. More like over cooked sobs noodles than ramen noodles. What was really bad was the service. Waitress kept running off instead of talking to us. Asked about what drinks they had, she told us and then ran off without asking if we wanted any drinks. Very unusual."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but there was a mixup of checks and overall just a lack of \"wow\" after my meal.   I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen (what I use as my baseline order for a new ramen place), and it was definitely yummy, but had a very...Chinese taste? Being Chinese, I have no qualms with a Chinese tasting noodle soup, but I was just slightly taken aback by this realization.    *Tonkotsu - Broth wasn't watery, chashu was well seasoned, noodles were thin (as I prefer) - a little long though (I had trouble maneuvering the right amount of noodle into my spoon because they just never separated), toppings (wood ear fungus mostly) were reasonably rationed. My biggest issue though was the EGG!!! How did I not look closer at the menu?! I ended up with a hard boiled egg, and was pretty disappointed, since the soft boiled egg is one of my major critique points with ramen. *Shio - I only took a sip of the broth, but I think I like the Tonkotsu a little more, personally. Still, it was well seasoned and very corny *Chashu don - umm...super Chinese? I couldn't pinpoint what exactly it tasted like, but it reminded me a lot of Chinese style pork sauces.   Nishikawa is pretty decent and really not bad at all, but I probably would venture out to some other ramen places before coming back here."}
{"text":"Happened  on this place by chance while looking for a place to have lunch withy girls.  First impression FANTASTIC!  Friendly energetic staff,  atmosphere, fun and inviting,  food....  AMAZING.  Highly recommend this place to friends and family or to anyone that wants to step out of the norm.  I'd give more stars if I could"}
{"text":"2nd time here and Nishikawa Ramen never disappoints me. Probably best Ramen place so far in the east valley. It's open seating so you can feel free to sit everywhere you like. Place isn't as big but it works. Food is great for the price. You can feed two for $20 that's pretty good i say. Nothing bad to say about this place. Bathroom is nice and clean that's always a thumbs up. Overall a great place to try. Recommend to all my ramen lovers out there."}
{"text":"It's all about the Nishikawa Black Ramen. The broth isn't too heavy or salty, it's perfect! The soft boiled egg is a must! Don't forget to request it."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and found the gem. My family enjoyed the Ramon and the rice bowel."}
{"text":"I can honestly give Nishikawa 5 stars. I've eaten ramen in many places including Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. Here in the US I've sampled ramen in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and here in Phoenix.   I listed the different places I've tried ramen just so you can see the variations I've tasted.   The ramen at Nishikawa is among the best I've ever had! It has the not too salty, flavorful broth, the chashuu has that melt in your mouth tenderness and the freshly made noodles are awesome.  The service is friendly and even on nights when they're super busy they take the time to check  on you. Not to say mistakes have not been made, but they also take the time to fix the problem. The food and overall service keep me and my family coming back here over and over again. =)"}
{"text":"I like this ramen place. I ordered the takoyaki and the chicken karaage but I gobbled those up quick so I don't have a photo! The karaage is like a flour battered chicken strip but very juicy. The takoyaki is generous with the bonito flakes. Yummy! (Takoyaki are octopus balls) For ramen, I ordered the curry ramen which is a special off menu dish. It's very tasty, not spicy. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I've been twice now, tried the Spicy Miso and the Nishikawa black, and I liked both a lot. Rich broth, seasoned just right on both visits, and the noodles cooked just right as well. I'm really happy to have this place in Chandler. I expect I'll eat here a lot."}
{"text":"I am so impressed with this Ramen place! They truly are the FIRST authentic ramen place in Arizona! The broth actually has flavor unlike several other places I've tried. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the food. The waitresses on the other hand could use a little more training. Although they are kind, it's pretty evident that they just don't know what they're doing serving-wise or even explaining the items on the menu."}
{"text":"We got take out and they screwed up one of the orders. Food didn't taste good at all."}
{"text":"I traveled a long way for this restaurant. I went to one of my friend's wedding in Gilbert during the weekend and I was dying for some noodles. Came here with the bride who is a huge fan of ramen. It was quite busy when we arrived. It was in a quiet plaza and with a nice decoration. Ramen in LA was always a long queue and I was not surprised it was really busy here too.   We came with a 5 year old kid and surprisingly he was very well behaved on that day. The staff who served our table was very friendly. Normally ramen place will be really small and noisy, but Nishikawa seems to be fine. It's a good place to bring families.   We waited a bit for our food, the pork and the broth were the best part. The noodle was slightly overcooked but it was very delicious in general. The soup was very tasty.   I don't know when I will be visiting here again but I will for sure come again if I do."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! I crave Nishikawa and they don't disappoint. I've tried other places that serve Ramen and nothing comes close to comparing"}
{"text":"I got ramen from here and it was good but my experience was horrific. I called for an order for pick up and asked for a side of rice instead of noodles because I am gluten free for health reasons. They told me that they are not making any rice because they were closing early (I called an hour before the advertised closing time). I asked why they were closing early when picking up my order and they said because they \"weren't busy\" even though they had several pick up orders other than mine waiting...... Food was good but the customer service was a 1 out of 10 in every way. They were even talking negative about me while I was in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious - but keep reading! I ordered the Yokohama Style Ramen and my boyfriend ordered the Miso. We forgot to ask for the egg soft-boiled - would highly recommend you don't forget to do so. Overall, the broth and noodles were amazing, however the pork was very soft and not very lean (not my preference).   The service was alright, however we were the only customers and the waitress was not paying attention and didn't check up on us or ask questions when we were ordering. It felt as though the restaurant was packed, if I was judging on service.   This being said, our leftovers re-heated alright. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Tasty, good heat on the ramen without  overpowering of flavor.  Nailed the soft egg.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went to this place to check out their ramen. Despite its good review, their ramen was extremly bad. The noodle was well over cooked and the soup was lacking flavor. It is not even close to be a authentic Japanese ramen. The Karrage was undercooked and it looked like they just put the frozen chicken in a microwave. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Best ramen in AZ for sure! The restaurant is pretty small though and doesn't seat that many people. The portions are ample. Here are the dishes we tried: - Katsu Bowl (would NOT recommend) - Nishikawa Black: the best! a very rich, flavorful broth. - Yokohama: broth is still very good The ramen here is comparable to the ramen that I've tried in Japan. (It's just that good, seriously!) Make sure to request the soft-baked egg."}
{"text":"The dining area is really small. Personally I would not recommend for large groups. All in all it's not a bad place. The miso is pretty good."}
{"text":"The eggs come hard boiled by default, so ask for soft boiled if that's what you want! Tried both the tonkotsu ramen and miso ramen, they are both amazing! Different bowls come with different style noodles, so if you want curly ramen noodles, order appropriately.   Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I honestly don't even know where to begin..... we'll... her we go... every time I Yelp places i try to go in with high hopes... and this place sky rocketed into outer space! We had the Nishikawa Black soup the texture, noodles, thickness of soup.... flavors bursting in your mouth!!!OUTSTANDING!!! We also had the Katy's Bowl, which was very delicious!!! Super authentic! Super flavorful! I will definitely come here again... and I would recommend Nishikawa Ramen to friends, family even strangers!"}
{"text":"The vegeterian and vegan miso is really good! Tons of flavor. The restuarant itself is pretty small so it can get crowded quickly, but you can order your food to go and they'll keep the broth seperate from the noodles so they don't get mushy! This location is still pending it's liquor application so not sure how prices on that will be yet. A good price for food based on the portion size."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place was jumping on a Sunday noontime but we got a table for two. Lots of families and couples of all ages. But the food?  Outstanding!  The flavors burst. The textures of all dimensions. This all is just another example of culinary excellence!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I was between 3 and 4 stars. The servers seemed a bit uncertain, and they were out of the agedashi tofu that I had so looked forward to trying. I asked for the vegetarian ramen, which is not on the menu, but I had been advised on the Facebook page would be an option. My server advised that they did not have vegetarian ramen. However, right as I was about to leave, the owner came out and apologized and stated he was, indeed, able to make vegetarian ramen. So of course, I stayed. The ramen was phenomenal. Jay, the owner, is exceptionally nice, and he remembered me the second time I came in. By my third time, they all knew right away I would be getting the vegetarian ramen. Oh, and I got the agedashi tofu the second time I was there and it was great. Jay always comes by to chat. This is a very new place, so clearly they have some kinks to work out, but the food is just incredibly top notch. Some places offer vegetarian ramen that is just weird. Or creamy, I don't like that. But this veg ramen is just spot on. The broth is so delicious. And the noodles they make in house are just divine. If you are looking for curly noodles, you won't find them here, but it doesn't make them any less fantastic. I will be coming here at least once a week while I still live in the area. It's so nice for the east valley to finally have a ramen house!"}
{"text":"One star for the chicken kaarage. There's a good crisp to it but there was absolutely no flavor and no seasoning.  No star for the ramen. They do not use real ramen; they use soba and call it ramen. The broth was so thick and there was no flavor.   Do not recommend."}
{"text":"It may not be traditional but it's delicious. The Nishikawa Ramen is incredibly flavorful, full of a deep black garlic richness. The kicker for me is the smoked egg which might sound intimidating but is incredibly delicious"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is usually a picky eater when it comes to ramen but he love this place and so do I! Their broth is so creamy and delicious and their homemade noodles are really up to par! Their servings are hefty and they have great consistency. Best ramen shop in Arizona I believe."}
{"text":"SOLID 4.5 stars. Tonkotsu (or pork bone stock) ramen is the closest I've tried in Phoenix  (oily - real Tonkotsu ramen is supposed to be greasy- and creamy) to what you get in its birth place Kyushu (I'm from Kyushu).  Chashu pork was also on the dot, melt in you mouth tender.  I had to deduct 0.5 point for the boiled egg which should have been a little more flavorful, & for ramen noodle which is little different from what I'm used to in Japan. Nevertheless highly recommended.   I'm so sad this place is far from our place :("}
{"text":"The best ramen in town. Now, I don't have to travel to Chandler to satisfy my craving. Try the Nishikawa black, takoyaki, and chicken karaage."}
{"text":"Best Ramen Place In whole AZ ! So good! So so Good!!! Like the best authentic Ramen you can buy!! I cannot stress enough the idea, that this place is so well put together! And just overall amazing ! Great food ! Great service! Awesome people! Each and one of them are great people! With the best service !! If you are looking for a place with good ramen!!! This is it man!!! Best ramen in Arizona! Just simply put the best!! Give it a shot ! You will not be disappointed not one bit!!! Try it all! Its all so mouth watering food!!! Try it!!! Try the tonkustsu Ramen!!!! Just amazing man!!! Amazing !!!!"}
{"text":"So I remember coming here around the time they first opened back in June but never wrote a review. I came with a couple girlfriends including Karen W, and every time I go somewhere with Karen W. she writes killer reviews so promptly that I might as well just write \"ditto Karen W.'s review.\" They definitely have improved their food and service since their opening.  I came here by myself around 8:15pm on a Sunday night for a quick meal. I ordered their tonkatsu ramen and asked for it as spicy as possible. They delivered! It was delicious :) The charsiu was quite tender, more so than I remembered before so that was a big improvement. The broth ran out quickly so I had to order extra broth and I enjoyed the charsiu so much I ordered extra.   I ordered a spicy tuna donburi bowl and salmon donburi bowl to-go. The donburi bowls are very reasonably priced (around $5) and a good portion for a light but satisfying lunch.   Thank you for the great meal!"}
{"text":"Almost three stars, but the weird noodles dragged it down to two.     Tonkotsu Ramen: Disappointing, overall.   Good broth. The katsuobushi powder is an interesting twist.   One slice of pork; decent.  No nori, but the kikurage mushroom adds a nice texture.  Unfortunately, the slippery medium thick straight noodle reminded me strongly of (bad) Korean soba.  It is nasty.     Pork Gyoza: Looks nice, but so flavorless.   Served on a bed of lettuce with a cherry tomato, a wedge of lemon and a soy-vinegar sauce .  Nicely browned on one side, but the skin is a bit too moist on the other sides.    As noted, it has no taste.  Needs garlic, ginger, pepper, green onion, or something ... Maybe minced pork that hasn't been frozen for a month would help as well.    The decor looks like a bunch of Chinese-made \"Japanese-ish\" stuff fixed to the walls, window, and the entrance.  At least it is fairly sparse and not overwhelming.    The waiter is friendly, but the pork gyoza recommendation is terrible.    The chili paste on the table looks like someone grabbed the oily chile sauce from a hole-in-a-wall Cantonese restaurant and let it dry into a chunky paste.   Is this a money saving replacement for shichimi togarashi?    Fun factoid:  \"chuuka soba\" is another name for ramen, and it means \"Chinese soba\"--BUT, it does NOT mean one should toss (bad) soba noodles into good tonkotsu broth!"}
{"text":"Really great ramen!   Potstickers were also great - light, homemade  Kaarage was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! I LOVE that you can order a soft boiled egg with your Ramen. We started out with some tapas. Which were awesome... But if you don't get here early your protein choices may be limited. Akin to traditional Japanese restaurants. Thoroughly enjoyed the presentation and food... Will become a regular.. Domo Arigato..."}
{"text":"SLURP!!! At first, I was little scared that this place was new to businesses, but boy was I just over- worrywart! This place is so good!!! The broth was fantastic, the noodle was great, the service was ok. The downside is toppings  are not much choices, BUT the favor of ramen is all in the broth, so who cares about toppings...I will keep coming back for flavor, coming back for fatty pork!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to have a ramen place closer to home.  I looked up the menu before going and when I got there some of things they didn't have. The portions were small and there wasn't much variety in broth or topping choices.  The fried chicken appetizer was the only decent there. Maybe I am used to other ramen places but even the broth wasn't very tasty."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for ramen. Been here a couple of times and the ramen has always been good. The broth is flavorful and the portion sizes are decent.   The first time we went, the quality of the food was good except for the fact that they didn't bring out the takoyaki until we were more than halfway done with our meals.  Not sure if we came on on off day the other day, but when we arrived for dinner, the restaurant was full aside from a couple of empty but not yet wiped down tables so we waited at the door. The wait staff kept looking at us but no one said anything to us or acknowledged our presence until some time later, which was kind of uncomfortable. Once we were seated, everything else we ordered came out relatively quickly. We ordered two Yokohama style ramen and a side of gyoza, but for some reason the gyoza we received was cold, as if it had been sitting out for awhile.   Overall, the ramen is decent but I'm in no rush to come back for now."}
{"text":"Ramen noodles good not great, broth bland lacked veggies and pork was fatty. To go order had no chili oil or soy sauce. Needs improvement."}
{"text":"The ramen and chicken karaage was pretty good here. I must admit that the ramen here is one of the best in the Phoenix area. It was flavorful. I just wished that they had the type of chili powder that other ramen restaurants usually use. The chili powder they use is more of just spicy rather than seasoning as well. The chicken karaage could have also been a little more flavorful with more seasoning. There was only one server there and the place was pretty full. The server handled everything very well and did not seem stressed at all from all the people, which I liked. Overall, I had a good experience there."}
{"text":"Small menu but the food was great. I wouldn't mind driving all the way on that side of town to have another bowl of Miso."}
{"text":"Ramen is perfect. Good service. Clean environment. Parking lot is big.  The price is ok."}
{"text":"The tonkotsu soup was no real tonkotsu flavor..But I liked Ikura bowl.There was  some fruits taste sake that I wanted try! I have never seen when I was in Japan before! also Takoyaki was good."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal! The space is a bit small. I don't think they took into account having a rush hour and where people would wait for a table. Our waiter took awhile to get to us and the food took even longer. It's definitely a cozy place for one or two. I don't see them accommodating large parties. As far as food, would 100% recommend."}
{"text":"Plain basic good food and not worth all the chandler stars.  Needs beer and a bar to get 4 stars."}
{"text":"They have great ramen and rice bowls. The ramen is very flavorful and is decently priced for what you get. Good portion sizes for the ramen. The rice bowls are a lot smaller, but they are much cheaper, good options if you aren't hungry or don't eat a lot."}
{"text":"I forgot to order my egg soft boiled so I need to go back. Everything else was excellent. I'm a ramen novice, but I really appreciated what they had to offer. It felt like it took a lot of time to make. It was really nice."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing! Michaela was extremely personable, knowledgable, and really added to our fantastic experience. Our water was always full and the staff was attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"I went once with work, my wife went separately another time for lunch. Both times the food was great. They did need more table seating, but there was plenty of room at the bar."}
{"text":"Fresh ramen!!!!  Omg I need bot say anymore!!  Ramen and Gyoza were amazing!! I loveeee the Miso Ramen!!! I make it spicy, but thst fresh corn, pork belly, and scallions top that bowl right off!!  I only discovered this place 3 weeks ago, but I feel like I've gone at least once a week to get my ramen fix.  This is one of my spots I will be frequently visiting.  Ohh yeah and did I mention the super cheap price!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty noodle bar , friendly staff , only thing I would criticize is the straight noodle is not ramen. Nor is it as tasty as the curdled noodle."}
{"text":"This is an excellent bowl of ramen and solid karaage. We had the Nishikawa black and Yokohama bowls of ramen. Quick service, reasonably priced, good portions, fun ambience, all around good place to go to."}
{"text":"\"A taste of Japan, an authentic ramen noodle bar in East Valley, Arizona\"  The best cure for a hangover is something hot and soupy. So glad Chandlier had something to offer.   I ordered the Nishikawa Black: \"pork broth, pork chasu, green onion, memma, kikurage, fried onion, black garlic oil, sesame, seasoned egg, nori dried seaweed, shredded pepper\"  I loved the broth as it wasn't too thick but still packed the flavor of black garlic. I was not a fan of the noodles as it was the skinny thin kind. However, their portion was pretty hefty that I actually got full. The seasoned egg was disappointing as there was no seasoning whatsoever.   I also ordered a spicy tuna bowl to share. It was too salty and I wasn't a fan of the minced tuna as it was minced too much.   I think I've been spoiled by California that my standards have been set higher. Nishikawa Ramen may be the best in East Valley, Arizona, but it doesn't compare to California. Nevertheless, it was satisfying enough to bring me to a food coma."}
{"text":"This place has real deal ramen!  Super efficient staff and good value for the $$.  Get the black and don't be afraid of the spice."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The Nishikawa Black is some of the best ramen I've ever had.  The blend of flavors is perfection in a bowl."}
{"text":"OMG! THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!! Daughter and I were having some mad cravings for some ramen. I check out Yelp and hope there is a spot near by. Lo and behold.... Nishikawa Ramen!!!! Good assortment of reviews, enticing photos.... decision made at 8pm on a Sunday night. We made the quick drive to Nishikawa Ramen, easy to spot from the street. The place is quaint from the outside, in a strip mall next to a Hungry Howie's on the corner anchored by a self storage facility. Inside however,  was fun and refreshing. Full of Japanese pop culture my little one loves. We were seated promptly and brought water by our friendly server. The menu is simple and concise. We were excited to see they offered Japanese soda! Had to try out the strawberry and mango cream.... mmmmmm tasty. I had the Yokohama Ramen, and my daughter had the Miso Ramen. The broth was full of flavor. The pork tender and noodles cooked perfectly. We both had a great experience and enjoyed our dinner! I am so glad we found this place! We will be back soon...."}
{"text":"Walked in shortly after opening and was promptly pointed to a table.  There were a couple of people sitting at the bar and 2 other tables.    I've been here a few times before this place switched from Sushi to Ramen.  Looks about the same.  The 2 servers were friendly and both returned throughout the meal to check up on us, our meal and refill waters.  Everything we ordered was well cooked and flavorful.    The broth for the Ramen was well balanced and rich.  A plus for me was that it wasn't as salty as many other Ramen shops.  Noodles tasted fresh and still had a good chew/bite towards end of meal.  My fav was the Spicy Tonkotsu, although it wasn't really spicy.  Adding the chili flakes on the table helped.  For the Nishikawa Curry Ramen, the broth wasn't curry but had a good curry flavor.  Again, adding the chili flakes on the table helped.  The other Ramens we ordered were good \"as is\" (Original Tonkotsu and Nishikawa Black).  The pork Chashu was melt in your mouth and perfect.  The Katsudon (breaded pork cutlet over rice) was great for a picky eater who didn't want Ramen.   This is now my go-to place for Ramen in AZ."}
{"text":"First time here and was not disappointed. Ordered two types of ramen, Miso and Niahikawa Black, which were both different but very good. My preference was the Miso, the broth was not as potent so it was very nice. The pork was a bit fatty but very flavorful. The chicken karaage appetizer was well seasoned and crispy, it was really good with some lemon juice and the ying yang dipping sauce.  The only mishap was that the smoked egg was over cooked, not the gooeyness that I was expecting. Nonetheless I will be back.  Ordered: - Chicken Karaage, 4.5 stars - Miso Ramen, 4 stars  - Nishikawa Ramen, 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Nishikawa (According to Google) means \"Western river\" in Japanese and is a family name in Japan. Nishikawa Ramen (According to me) means flavorful and delicious noodle soup!   We came here on a Monday at 7 P.M. I saw on their website that they offered reservations so I contacted them for our reservation on Monday a few days before. When we arrived, I told the server that came to greet us that we had a reservation under my name. She gave me a blank stare and said \"OK. Reservation. I'll...be...right...back...\" Hm.... looks like someone forgot to write down our reservation... Or the server wasn't told about it...  It was fairly busy but there were a few tables still available and we were seated at a booth in a few minutes. The menu has pork based and chicken based broths, soba, and rice bowls. Appetizers include takoyaki, spicy squid, gyoza, and agedashi tofu. I went with the house black ramen and shared some takoyaki and spicy squid salad.   The ramen came out first before the appetizers. The broth was flavorful and filling, and the entire bowl was filled with noodles, pork, bamboo shoots, nori, kikurage (Wood ear mushroom), fried onion, garlic chips, and green onion. I loved the pork. It was very tender and meltingly soft. It's a more fatty cut of meat so this isn't your meal if you're looking for something healthy. The egg was halfway between soft boiled and hard boiled, as the very center of the yolk was runny but the outer ring was solid. There is a condiment bowl at the table with chopped red chile that I tried with a scoop of broth. It added flavor but only a mild-medium amount of heat for me. The noodles were thicker as advertised, and had a good texture and elasticity.   The squid came out around the same time the last ramen bowl arrived did and was lightly crisp from the fried battered coating. I enjoyed it with the spicy sauce. The takoyaki came out last, and was comped on our bill since it didn't come out sooner with the rest of our meals. The outer crisp coating was a great complement to the soft center and there was a good amount of octopus in each fritter. I would have liked a little more texture in the fritter other than batter and octopus but to each their own!  I also had an iced green tea which was excellent. It was very lightly sweet and refreshing.  Service could use some more work, but hey it's opening week I won't fault them too much for not getting service 100% right. In general all our servers were friendly.   My friend initially wanted to take home an order of ramen but was told they don't offer the ramen to go because the quality of the takeout will be inferior to eating it there since the noodles will get overcooked. So, she decided to order a rice bowl (Tonkatsu donburi) and was told they would serve it in a bowl and they would give her a styrofoam container but they wouldn't actually deliver it to her in the styrofoam container. OK..... strange.  Overall we had an enjoyable experience here and while it's a little bit of a drive from where I live, I'll be back if I'm in the area or want to try something else out with some friends.  EDIT 6-22: Jay from the restaurant contacted me the day after our reservation and thanked me for coming (I think he's the head chef/owner?). He said he wanted to come out and say hi to our table but they got swamped with orders so he didn't get a chance to. They are doing some internal adjustments and retraining their servers based on what they've encountered during their soft opening so they are temporarily closing but will open back up again soon for those that are ravenous for ramen!"}
{"text":"Recently people in one of the groups I follow on Facebook were discussing the best places in the East Valley for ramen. I have only been to a ramen restaurant a few times. I am more of a cheap at-home ramen guy who not only holds on to broke college student style from years ago, but I also make it incorrectly and most people look at me oddly when I make it. Nonetheless, I know real ramen is good and much different than I boil up at home. I was surprised to see that the restaurant receiving so many votes as the best was just two streets away from my house.  The menu had a good selection of dishes as well as additional items one could add. Being my first time here I just went with a regular menu item and selected the Yokohama Style Ramen. It was a very large bowl that I didn't quite finish. Excellent flavor, filled with noodles, seaweed, egg, onions, and sprouts - plus multiple large pieces of pork belly. They have a few Japanese beers and sake, but I went with a hot green tea. I loved the décor and the collection of trinkets at the front. This is so close to my house I will definitely be a frequently returning customer. They also have takeout."}
{"text":"I ordered the black garlic ramen and it didn't have much black garlic at all and the soup lacked a flavor. The pork needed to be cooked longer as it was a bit chewy. I also ordered the chicken karage and it needed to be seasoned more. The noodles and the egg we're cooked well though."}
{"text":"Best ramen ive had in Arizona. I would recommend the black garlic ramen."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen place in Arizona by far! I suggest the Yokohama style ramen, however I have tried different menu items and I have enjoyed them all! I've even taken my ramen to-go and it was just as delicious at home. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had two bowls of ramen (veggie and tonkotsu) and takoyaki, all three were delicious! Also, their music taste is excellent!:) The decor is modern, simple and clean."}
{"text":"Very good ramen . My husband and I enjoyed our dishes with all the fresh vegetables and delicious noodles. Service was quick and efficient. We will definitely revisit."}
{"text":"Alright, so surely by now you've seen that reviews for this new restaurant are *ALL OVER THE PLACE*, and there's a very good reason for that. This is a brand new restaurant and they're having a rough time with it- the waitstaff, from what I can tell, are extremely new to the game (our server today said it was her first day) and they're getting *MOBBED* with customers. We came here at just before 1pm and the place quickly filled to capacity. Now, if you've ever worked as a server, then you know that it is A FUCKING TOUGH AND THANKLESS JOB. And if you haven't ever worked as a server, then you can go fuck yourself and keep any opinion of the job to yourself, because you don't get to comment. So yeah, most of the waitstaff are young and brand new, and are having a tough time with the orders. It happens. Have some compassion and understanding, you bourgeoisie twats.   Anyways- it was our server's first day, and she had a rough time with it. Several things that we ordered weren't available (the ramune sodas, hot green tea) but she was very apologetic about it. So no problem- again, it's their first few days of being open and they probably planned for conservative sales. We ordered takoyaki, the Nishikawa black house ramen, and the Nishikawa curry ramen. Our takoyaki came out and I turned into an anime panda. These were seriously the best takoyaki that I've ever had outside of Tokyo, and better than most of the ones I've had when there. Slathered in nori, katsuo-bushi, and sauce, they were nevertheless light and ethereal, with chewy bits of octopus inside. They were amazing, and honestly if that was my entire meal then this would have been a five-star review. We had to wait a little while for chopsticks and napkins, but again our server was slammed with tables and was doing the best that she could. A gentleman from the kitchen came to check on us, and brought us our tableware and another plate of takoyaki (which was probably for another table).  After a few more minutes, our server came back and apologized... our order *HAD* been made, and it was taken to another table. Another order had sat in the back and gotten soggy in the meantime, but they were out of ramen for the moment so they'd like to prepare something else for us from the kitchen, free of charge. I was frustrated by this, because I was *REALLY* looking forward to ramen, but like I said... shit happens. We ordered pork chashu and kara-age. Both came out several minutes later, and both were absolutely DELICIOUS. Their kara-age is very unique- it has a mildly sweet sauce topping it. Their pork chashu is also similarly delicious, and you should definitely try them.  The chef came to our table and apologized profusely. He gave us a gift card to come back and try their ramen, and he was so nice about it that any frustration which I'd had was instantly evaporated. If you're asking HOW CAN THEY RUN OUT OF RAMEN!?!??!, I'd like to remind you that they make their noodles fresh here, and that isn't something that you can just whip up in twenty minutes. That's the downside of making things in-house, especially if you haven't been open long enough to gauge for demand. That's one of the big things that you need to keep in mind- they're still figuring this stuff out, folks!!!  We'll be back next week to try out their ramen, and at that time I'll update my review if need be. Our experience here today was frustrating but understandable, but the entire staff was so apologetic and they genuinely took ownership for the experience. And that was a big thing- they took ownership for the experience and I feel like they'll learn from this weekend and have a good business moving forward."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Growing up in Asia, authentic ramen is really hard to come by and this place definitely delivered. :) The chicken karaage was a hit too. Love it! The servers were excellent, ambiance was relaxed, prices were reasonable and the portions were big. I highly recommend Nishikawa!!"}
{"text":"Great spot and not too long of a line for a Saturday night dinner.  Such quaint decor of Ghibli characters on each tables!!! The price is pretty good for ramen, ok bowl size. Side orders are also very good such as takoyaki and chicken karaage. We had the veggie, tonkatsu and curry. All delicious!! They also have a few selections of their rice bowl, small in proportions for $5.  Good service and great accommodations from the place."}
{"text":"Excellent. Broth is fantastic. I had Nishikawa Black ramen and it was as good as any Asian noodle dish I've ever had. OK, I'm lying. It was BETTER than any Asian noodle dish I've ever had. Not particularly inexpensive at around $10 a bowl, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened, I came here with 2 other friends for lunch on a Tuesday. Service excellent as always.  We shared an order of the Pork Goyza, which were fantastic. Ramen ordered was the Tonkotsu and 2 Nishikawa Blacks all with Soft Egg request. All the Ramen presented was beautifully and tasted fantastic all except the Pork Chashu which was as tuff as leather. You couldn't bit through it, nor cut it. I told our server and she apologized and gave us another piece which ended up to be the same. I been here several times and the pork has always been perfectly cooked. Maybe a bad day!  Service excellent, Ramen Fantastic except for this one time, Pork issues. I will come back again and cross my fingers that it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"I like the food here, it's definitely tasty! However, it's a little difficult to order when your server doesn't understand English. She was very sweet, very attentive, and an excellent server all around. But my husband and I both had trouble simply telling her what we wanted. I wanted the vegetarian Ramen with no egg. (THATS IT!) And she brought out noodles plain noodles with plain broth..... Ummmmmm... We almost left. Everyone else bad the same problem."}
{"text":"So good. I've been looking for L.A. style ramen and I've found it. The Tonkatsu broth is great. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The first time I came was on Friday when they had soft opening. I came around two pm and the server said they were not ready and already informed in Facebook that they will open at 5pm. (Darn, I was like so hungry, long drive too..)  The second time I came with my friends. The drinks came quite fast although we have to wait more than 40 minutes for the server to take our order.  The green tea, when it first came, the color quite thick green, very nice flavor, not too sweet. The second drink, the color got light, watery, and sweeter.   The ramen house black that I ordered, the flavor was light. Tips for you guys who usually like salty food, you will need more salt or soy. The pork meat was very soft and great flavor, little bit salty, so I think it quite balance with the broth.   The takoyaki, the fried very nice outside, but the batter inside wasn't cook enough, so we ordered the second one and ask them to cook it longer, it turned out very good.  The calamari fried, no batter on it, so I thought, maybe they concept was super less batter, (I think..lol).   Overall, all the foods that we ordered was OK.   The services, OMG, they only have 2 servers and keep meshed up the the order even she wrote it on her paper, but still she keep asked us like 3 times, and sent the wrong one. Which part that she missed actually? lol...For that, one star for the services, but again, I would like to give them 3 stars for their patience for taking care the angry's customer."}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying this place has the best traditional ramen! If you are vegetarian you can get the veg. Broth. I got the Nishikama Black ramen with a soft boiled egg. Lot of food and a must go in chandler! It's a small place so call ahead to see the wait time, but I promise you it's worth the wait. Check it out"}
{"text":"Nishikawa Ramen!! Gosh, what can I say Im just really love having these diverse cultural dives popping out here in the Valley. I AM truly a huge fan of this Ramen restaurant especially, when they marinate the broth for more than 20 hrs and they make their noodles from scratch fresh every morning- i mean you know this place is top notch! I love my Ramen, Seafood and asian food and Its because im born/raised in Oahu, Honolulu where we have so much of these places back home. Ive been too a few here in the Valley and it was \"One time deal only\" but, I come here once a week usually for \"Take out!\" but, this past week was my first time I actually had some time to bring a co-worker and we ate in! Shes a vegetarian so I was surprised they had a Veggie Ramen, sorry im all about having chasiu in my Ramen - my favorite dish is the Nishikawa Black - all my favorite ingredients and just every single bite and slurp of their pork broth Its so divine!! For our appetizer I suggested we have their \"Takoyaki\" now, if you are not a seafood person - stick with the gyozas or something else because you wont acquire the taste! But, their Takoyaki is one of the BEST Takoyaki I had ever tasted before in my entire life! Not even back home in Honolulu - just cannot compare at all! I even asked the waitress what is in the ball and she kept saying the dough/steaming! Whatever it was \" literally melts in your mouth\" and pieces of the octopus - gosh, totally worth it for us seafood lover! The funny part is because it came out steaming hot and they put the furikake (seaweed) and flakes of the dry skin octopus on it was moving... Hahaha! My friend was like \"what da???\" Lol- i told her \"Hello, Its steaming hot so the octopus flakes is just shrinking I grabbed some of it and ate it... Lol! So she feels comfortable and know Its Okay, too eat! Cracked up laughing told her \"Eh, good thing no more the eyes!\" Lol- eat that too! Lol Im Happy to advertise this place and Happy they make one of the best Ramen place in the Valley! I do however agree with some of the Yelp reviews on here that their young kids in here sometimes give bad customer service! - just smile girls, breathe, and relax!! Lol"}
{"text":"We ordered Ramen to-go, we got the Yokohama and Nishikawa Black. It was disappointing. Both broths were overly-salty and otherwise bland. There was sparse toppings and they were really skimpy on the protein. Both bowls only had 2-3 small pieces of meat. It was primarily noodles that were under-cooked.   Usually I wouldn't return for a second round. In light of all the positive reviews, I'll be giving this place a second chance and posting an update review."}
{"text":"First time trying out this ramen spot. They did not disappoint! We ordered the spicy miso and curry ramen with a side of gyoza. So good!! We'll be back again."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. I would be here every other day if I didn't live a bit too far away. (Which is probably a good thing!)  It's a small, neat little shop with some tables, booths, and bar-type seating. The traffic seems variable; sometimes I've been in there for lunch and was the only one there, other times it's been packed. That being said, they bring out your food relatively quickly, so the tables are turned fairly quickly as well.  The food is just. so. tasty. I stick to the Yokohama Style (with an extra egg, of course), but the Nishikawa Black and the Shio are also supremely good. I've also had the gyoza, spring rolls, and takoyaki and loved them, which is unfortunate seeing as I'm physically incapable of eating a bowl of ramen and 3 appetizers on my own.  The staff is always very kind and helpful, and are especially quick on the water refills (which is important here in AZ!) which is appreciated.   I love this place and you should definitely go here because you'll love it too."}
{"text":"Pretty good. My first time having ramen. Love that they make the noodles by hand. Not too many choices but food is good and that's what counts!"}
{"text":"The chicken gyoza and Yokohama style ramen are delectable. My favorite place to order out from."}
{"text":"I love ramen places. My gf and I make it a point to try out all the new ramen joints that pop up but we were honestly pretty disappointed with this place. We ordered the most popular ramen bowls -the tonkatsu and nishikawa black. The flavor was average . I ordered a soft boiled egg and paid the extra charge because soft boiled egg is a MUST with ramen. However, the egg was hard boiled both out bowls which was disappointing. They are skimpy with their pork belly- there was just one piece on top of a bunch of noodles. I wish the ratio was more even like other ramen places we've been to. Also, they need to hire another server. The poor girl was waiting and serving a full house of customers all by herself and I know how hard that is previously being a server myself. Just by looking around the room there were lots of disappointed/angry customers waiting for their orders to be taken or bills to come. The place has potential if they try to make improvements!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing!  I love ramen and have been to alot of ramen restaurants but this has been the tastiest and most authentic ramen I have ever had! The takoyaki was amazing, it's a must get when you are here!"}
{"text":"Nothing is better than ramen during a cold day. This place hits the spot. The broth was very rich and flavorful. The service was very fast and efficient. The only problem was that they are currently undergoing renovations so part of the restaurant was closed off. It will be interesting to visit it when it is redone."}
{"text":"I have no idea what to say about this place. It has honestly taken me a few days to even think of something to say. Where do I begin.... first it was very unorganized, everyone was running around. People standing waiting in the front with no one greeting. I stood there at first and was confused if someone was going to take our name down. There was an older couple that had already been waiting prior to us arriving who left. My husband asked me if i just wanted to go somewhere else. I said no I want to try this place. So we ended up sitting at the bar. Our waitress was very nice. We ordered Chicken Karaage, Nishikawa Black, and the Spicy Miso. The broth literately tasted like powder and was so thick and I just cant even describe it. It was starting to turn into gelatin . My Pork on the top of my Spicy Miso was nothing but a big piece of fat I couldn't even eat it. The noodles where hard and could have been boiled a lot longer. The appetizer was probably the only good think oh and the house Green Tea. I also thought that it was really unusual that they were putting dirty dishes on the back bar where they put the food that was ready to go to a customer. I don't think I will be returning. My cup of ramen the next day was better...."}
{"text":"Not bad for all the spots I've tried so far in Arizona. While waiting for our table, they have an old game machine we played with, which was entertaining haha. Sat down and knew what we wanted :) I had the Yokohama ramen mild spicy and it was perfect in spiciness and richness of flavor. I substituted the bean sprouts for corn with no additional charge and you have to specially order soft boiled eggs if you prefer it. My boyfriend has the Nishikawa ramen which was delicious with so much garlic flavor! Yum! Only disappointment was the soft boiled eggs not having flavor when you bite into the middle, but everything else was tasty. It was also interesting that there were different noodles depending on the soup base you order. I has the curvy ramen noodles and my boyfriend's was the straight ones. I liked the curvy more though :p We also had takoyaki which came halfway through our ramen and it was perfectly crisp on the outside and a good amount of octopus inside :) wait wasn't too long for dinner on a Sunday night, most likely returning here one day :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen sub the straight noodles with the curly noodles which I prefer. The broth is perfect not too salty but flavorful and subtle. Slice of pork makes the soup even better. Also had the Chicken Karaage made the perfect meal, so good! Very clean and staff are very friendly. Definitely would be back to try others in the menu."}
{"text":"3.5 - 4 stars. The service was good though it felt a bit understaffed, the girl who served us did her best at taking care of all the tables. We ordered the Tonkotsu ramen (good!) and the Karaage bowl (so-so). It doesn't beat places like Kizuki Ramen or Ajisen Ramen ( maybe my standards for ramen are too high though to be honest). The ramen portion is definitely smaller compared to other ramen restaurants I've been to. The karaage bowl was small as well but that was expected for only being $5/6. I would come back for the noodles but not the rice bowl.  The food came out really though which was a plus! Overall, I'm just happy to have more of variety of ramen places in Phoenix"}
{"text":"It's southern Japan ramen taste. If you miss Asia food it's a good choice for you"}
{"text":"Simply put, the service was amazing here. The waitress was amazing and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It was very clean and very inviting. However, the ramen was extremely bland. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen. I feel like it's so hard to make ramen bland (even when it's simple instant ramen) and yet it felt like my noodles were just in mildly colored water. I was really excited for this and very open to trying it, but I was just let down by the flavoring and had to go back to my usual ramen place afterwards since I didn't end up eating much of it here. Great service and very clean restaurant, just very very bland ramen."}
{"text":"So glad they opened this location in Arcadia up! This is true authentic ramen at its finest. Their specialty Nishikawa Black bowl will change your life. Black garlic oil, rich pork broth, fall apart pork chasu, and a marinated soft egg (along with green onions, seaweed, bamboo shoots, and Mushrooms). On top of that, the servers are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly!"}
{"text":"These guys are still getting setup. Based solely on the food. \"Oh my god\" I had the curry and the broth was to die for. But when i added the red pepper flakes that had in he table, something magical happened and I was blow away. The noodles were perfect, the pork had the right amount of fat that gave is great flavor. The broth was literally good to the last drop. The goyza (so) pot stickers were delicious.   I can't wait to go back and do the whole thing all over again. I'm glad they're close to my neighborhood. I'd love to make this a regular eating spot.   :::UPDATE::::: We made a second run and were totally amazed....the broth is literally the best thing, I can honestly say I've never had anything this good state side. The goyza is even better and the sauce they serve takes that appetizer over the top. We took a group this time around and everyone was more than full. You don't realize you would be full, but the bowl packs a serious meal. The service is amazing and I love that this is close to my neighborhood. Go for the broth, stay for the great service and cozy atmosphere.   This has become a favorite dinning spot for my band mates and i."}
{"text":"this was sooo good!! first time actually having ramen with soft boiled egg so this was definitely a treat for me! get the tonkotsu!!! you wont be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Best ramen since Okinawa. I've tried all the ramen bowls on the menu and all are good but my go to is the Nishikawa Black. Truly my comfort food. They are also one of the few Japanese restaurants that carry Orion beer made in Okinawa. They also have a good selection of Japanese melon sodas thare so refreshing. Staff are both cheerful and attentive. Try some of the authentic appetizers., you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight with my husband and it did not disappoint! We try different ramen places all the time and this is definitely at the top of our list now. The broth is rich and flavorful! I asked for medium spice and to my pleasure it was actually spicy! Most places I've been to I have to add spice even when ordering spicy, but not here. We also got the octopus balls for an appetizer, they were delicious! Just how you want them- crunchy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside. Price was also totally reasonable and we both had leftovers to take home. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"FINALLY a ramen house in the Phoenix metro area that hits the spot! I've tried a few ramen places since I moved here a year ago and have been disappointed each time that I almost gave up the search. I saw Nishikawa's reviews and decided to make the drive to Chandler to check it out and I was so happy I did.  We ordered the Chicken Karage, Miso Ramen, and Yokohama Style Ramen. The Chicken Karage was not like most that I've tried in the past - the chicken pieces were more breaded but in a non-overwhelming way. We liked it and would have it again! I got the Miso Ramen and the broth was DELICIOUS. The noodles didn't get soggy, they got the soft-boiled egg perfect, and the serving size is large. I judge ramen mostly according to its broth and the noodles, and I'd say Nishikawa does a pretty good job on both. I haven't tried any other ramen here but if I'm ever really craving GOOD ramen in the PHX area, I would drive down here again."}
{"text":"I'm so happy they opened a location in Phoenix! I've been to the Chandler location once and have been wanting to come back, but it's a far drive so I haven't had the chance to and now I don't have to anymore. Wooo!  This is pretty close to work for me so I went for a quick lunch on their first week ish of opening. I had the chicken karage and miso ramen. Both were as yummy as I remember from 9 months ago when I tried it in their Chandler location. The broth was delicious and the soft-boiled egg and pork chashu were perfect.   I'll definitely be back. This is still the best ramen I've had in Phoenix so far."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really excited to try this place tonight. Got there about 8 and the place was fairly empty so we were seated right away. We had been browsing yelp prior to coming in and saw posted pictures of spicy ramen and curry ramen. When we looked at the menu neither of these items were listed and we were a bit confused. We also were confused that they are listed as a \"tapas bar\" except their \"tapas\" are literally just appetizers...your standard gyzos, spring rolls etc. When we mentioned to our waitress that we had seen spicy and curry ramens listed on Yelp she said that they make those and they just aren't on the menu, which was weird, but we rolled with it. Food came out pretty quickly. My spicy ramen was pretty good, not the best but alright for Gilbert ramen haha the spice level was pretty on point but the toppings were a little over done. My husbands curry ramen on the other hand was pretty freaking terrible. The broth was nothing but salty and tastes EXACTLY like a top ramen flavor packet. After about fifteen minutes of the poor dude trying to get through it, we realized that the ramen had soaked up the extremely salty broth in a way that could only be described as when you make $.69 top ramen and only add a quarter of the water. It was like eating thick top ramen season packet paste and the noodles turned mashy and gross. Overall, I don't know if we will be coming back here. The service wasn't that great either. Both waitresses weren't friendly or knowledgable and walked around like unfriendly zombies the entire time."}
{"text":"What a nice change. Good food,and prices.The owners honored a gift certificate for the old Taiko restaurant, they did not have to do that. Please give this progressive, and quality establishment a try."}
{"text":"Some of the best Ramen I have ever had. Great service nice atmosphere and delightful servers. I highly recommend the Green Tea ice cream."}
{"text":"I stand corrected, this establishment does make its own noodles as evidenced by the t-shirts the servers wear (and the owner contacted me after my last review). I went back and tried the Yokohama ramen which certainly has a different broth taste but is served with curly ramen noodles. I preferred these curly noodles with it's nice al dente mouth feel."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good authentic Ramen spot...FOUND IT! This place is legit. The broth was delicious. They have a good list of toppings. The gyoza was really good as well. Fast, friendly service too!"}
{"text":"It makes me really happy to have a ramen place near where I live! And a pretty good one that is. There is plenty of parking outside which is a plus. The place itself is a bit small but clean.  But lets get to the food: I got a tonkotsu ramen with black garlic oil and a soft boiled egg. Noodles were nice and chewy, the broth was flavorful and at the right temperature, soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly and even though you cannot see it on the picture there is chasu pork. The pork is well cooked: soft and not dry. But I definitely wish there was more of it.  We also got the takoyaki that was cooked nicely and had a good amount of octopus. They have many different types of ramen and I cannot wait to go back and try the other ones!"}
{"text":"Traveling through Phoenix and found this via Yelp. Quite impressed. The service was prompt, food was well presented will very satisfying portion size. We ordered spring rolls, ramen bowl and sashimi style spicy tuna rice bowl.  I will definitely return if we are in the area."}
{"text":"My Ramen adventure was not planned today, it was an accident! I was in the \"area\" and was looking for a place to grab some food when I spy some of my Yelp families reviews. So of course I was like mmmm hmmm let me see what the hype is about.   Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! I got the Nishikawa Black Ramen bowl medium spicy and I really enjoyed it. Definitely diff then the traditional ramen. The noodles are not traditional but they were good, good firmness without being under or over cooked and they make them in house. Broth was super flavorful and garlic was def very present. I did get an extra hard boiled egg. Very, very tasty. Also just FYI the fat on the pork is supposed to be there it adds to the flavor, I just peel the fat off. The pork was very tender.  I would def give it a solid 4 stars. It is so far the better of the 3 places I have tried around the valley ( I had given up). This is not my first Ramen rodeo folks!   Service is good also...heyyyy Emily and Debbie.   If you are in the area I would definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"Real ramen.  In Chandler.  Wow.  I just returned from Japan a month ago and was very sad as it is very difficult to find good Japanese food in Arizona.  And then Nishikawa, which is about five miles away from my house, appeared on the radar.  Watakushi wa sugoku ureshii desu yo!  The broth was rich, the pork was tender with plenty of flavor, and the noodles had the right flavor and texture.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time having Ramen this way as most always at home. The food was good love the Pork belly in the soup. We tried various versions of food there apps and noodles all was good. It is different with the pork broth flavor so if your not into pork wont be for you. The metal cups a nice touch with a nice carafe of water with lemon makes it nice. A variety of Japanese sodas was cool with a sugar ball in them first for that. Our server was great cant remember his name sorry about that but he explained and showed us the various soups and how to open that Japanese soda. Overall we will be back and recommend to try."}
{"text":"Overall a pretty disappointing experience. They didn't have soft boiled ajitama eggs that are typically served when I went, instead they gave me a hard boiled egg. Miso Ramen was salty. Curved noodles were decent. Chashu was tough, as it didn't fall apart easily. So many things wrong for one bowl"}
{"text":"Cute little ramen place in chandler. Friendly staff and pretty quick service. We came in on a Saturday right before the rush and our order came out in less than 10mins. We ordered a Tonkotsu, Miso, Nishikawa black and some Takoyaki. Everything came out pipping hot and delicious. The Tonkotsu was rich and creamy and paired well with toppings. The soft boiled egg was just right and I also liked that they have the option to have it hard boiled instead. My boyfriend and his friend finished their whole bowl and the broth."}
{"text":"Same great taste as the shop in Chandler. This location has a more modern take in decor. Very quick service and friendly staff. Had the Yokohama style and Nishikawa black both very delicious. Pro tip: get the soft boil egg. It's perfect with a goooey center. Also had their Hokkaido milk specialty drink, which is a carmelly easting ice green tea."}
{"text":"Great ramen. The ramen is homemade style and really fresh and tasty. The noodles and broth are both good and combine well. Although sometimes its a little crowded, the service is still good and well organized. I would like to come back next time."}
{"text":"This place...the food is consistent and taste like love. Service is on point; 10 out of 10, would recommend."}
{"text":"Just left the place and my mind has been blown! We ordered the Yokohama and a side of pork gyoza...both of our bowls were completely finished!  There was so much flavor in this bowl of soupy goodness!!!! The other Yelp reviews did not let us down.  The ramen was perfect for the weather. We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The Spicy Tuna Bowl was the best I had ever had. The vegetable ramen was delicious too. Unfortunately, the waitress couldn't remember anything. She forgot our order, forgot my son's drink, forgot to get us to-go containers and after asking twice my son finally went to the counter and asked for a third time. Because of all the forgetfulness it was a long dinner. Just waiting for our check and to-go containers took 20 minutes. Despite all that I would totally go back though!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I was really looking forward to it based on the other reviews.  I walked into the restaurant and there appeared to be one server on duty, and she was mopping up a puddle of water over by the beer cooler.  She promptly came over and took my to-go order, then returned to the mopping.  As I waited I watched her continue to mop, and noticed the mop head itself was slipping so she reached down put to put the mophead back on the mop.    As food was put onto the pass she would come over and grab the plates and take them to the tables.  At no time did she wash her hands, so EVERY plate was handled by the same hands that touched the mop head.  Thankfully my food came from the kitchen in closed plastic containers, so I didn't have to think about what was in that spill that may have found its way into my food.  Having has food poisoning before, I'm pretty aware of basic sanitation practices and this one really turned me off."}
{"text":"Nice little ramen place. Even though it was pretty busy they were getting food out quickly. The ramen soups were fantastic. My kids did not want their eggs so I got them .  I wish I would have remembered to ask for soft boiled eggs though. The broth had great flavor and was not salty at all. I will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that any ramen restaurants are opening in the valley, but I wish this place was a little better. Broth isn't great compared to other tonkotsu I've had and the noodle choice is not my favorite. You need to request soft-boiled on the tamago or you get hard-boiled by default.  Wish the to-go portions of the rice bowls were larger too.  I live close and want to like this place, but I don't find myself going very often."}
{"text":"Their soup and ramen are very salty. I don't recommend them if you are sensitive to salt. I tried them a couple times already hoping it was just the soup that days. I won't go back there anymore."}
{"text":"Really cute restaurant. It reminded me of some of the ramen shops in San Francisco, pretty authentic. They had a variety of Japanese beers you can't find everywhere (I like Orion from Okinawa), and had good sake options.  Very reasonably priced - we tried most of the menu for this reason! The only thing I didn't get to try was the salmon bowl because they were out of it today.  I had the Yokohama ramen (was very good) which is soy bean based and supposed to be slightly lighter and less salty then the Miso - which is soy based. I'm looking forward to trying the Miso next time to compare. Also had chicken and pork gyoza. If I had to pick I would say the pork is better, but both are great. I liked the spring rolls and the takoyaki (octopus balls) too. You really can't go wrong here. The staff is very friendly and will help you pick through your ramen options."}
{"text":"I love this ramen joint. Order anything on the menu and you'll be happy. I'll def be back if I'm ever in the area again"}
{"text":"I had a hell of time with service, they tried to fix it and I was patient...anyways I waited it out, the food was bomb. I'm really upset about the service but unfortunately the food is just too good to not go again. I'm sure they will be better next time. A hard 3 stars IMO"}
{"text":"I was recently in Japan and really enjoyed eating ramen everywhere I went. The best I had was on Dotonbori in Osaka, and this place comes pretty close to that. Very authentic Japanese ramen shop"}
{"text":"Good! Homemade noodles... good broth. Food was fresh and very tasty, service was good an fast. I had the Black Ramen and wife had the Miso Ramen. I think I liked her Miso a little better. This place is nice and worth going again. I do have another favorite Ramen place that I will continue to go too."}
{"text":"I was craving ramen and Nishikawa definitely delivered! I order the Nishikawa Black with the pork gyoza. Both were amazing. The textures and flavors were on point and the service was quick. I ordered to go and the server was helpful when taking my order, offered her suggestions and the meal came out within 10 minutes. I'll definitely be a regular at this spot now."}
{"text":"Really good ramen in a small unassuming space. I've been twice now. Definitely prefer the Yokohama style to the Tonkotsu, much richer flavor to the broth. I love soft boiled eggs in my ramen, they serve theirs with a hard boiled. Not bad, just not my preference.  Chicken Karaage appetizer is good. Nothing crazy special about it.  From now on, I will just order a Yokohama, extra egg (soft boiled, if they aren't out), and call it a day."}
{"text":"Too much mayo on takoyaki and katsu bowl. Ramen broth is too salty. We ordered a cup of hot water and mixed it in the broth. Service was good, food was ok."}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen. Possibly best in Phoenix area so far. Kara age chicken is great too. Order nishikawa black"}
{"text":"We went there for date night and had the Nishikawa Black,Yokohama Style ramen and the pork gyoza. It was delicious! The serving size was huge and the flavors were great. Can't wait to try more items off their menu!"}
{"text":"Finally a place in Phoenix that gets ramen right! I stopped by on a whim and picked up the spicy miso ramen along with an order of chicken gyoza. The chicken gyoza was cooked to perfection and is some of the best I've ever had. My spicy miso ramen had the right amount of heat and a nice creamy broth with a rich flavor. The only thing I would change were the noodles were a tad over cooked and kind of stuck together. However, this was only a minor issue and did not take away from the amazing flavors in the ramen. The service was friendly, prompt and courteous. I will definitely be back and have recommended this place to a lot of people!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some good ramen, and heard that they make their own noodles here everyday.  It was a bonus since they are open until 10:00 and I needed a late dinner.  When I came in, the server was very polite and welcoming.  The place is very neat and clean.  The only down side was that I found the menu to be more limited than other ramen restaurants.  All of the soups had pork, and since I don't eat pork I asked if there was a chicken or beef alternative.  There wasn't, but the server offered a vegetarian soup, which I ended up ordering.  It was delicious and full of fresh veggies, and plenty of bean sprouts, which I loved.  I would go here again for the veggie soup, or the chicken pot stickers to try, but almost anything else has some pork in it.  They did go the extra mile, and that makes all the difference in making me want to come back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try and doesn't disappoint! I have to be honest...my only experience with ramen is the cheap $1 packages at the store that I lived on when I was young. Thankfully, no similarity! The staff was kind and friendly helping me navigate my first ramen experience. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Noodles were good, pretty tasty but quite heavy for soup. A little more salt and fat than I expected."}
{"text":"Ordered takoyaki (octopus), gyoza and chicken karaage appetizers as well as spicy tuna rice bowl, miso and Nishikawa Black Ramen and 2 kinds of sake.   Great service (even though our waitress admitted it was her second day on the job) and excellent value.  Am giving it 4 stars only because the broth did not have the depth of flavor I have experienced at \"authentic\" Ramen houses in HI and CA but certainly among the best I've had in AZ.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"As sweet as the cook is and the staff are, the food here is terrible. The broth of any ramen needs to be good to make a place last. Unfortunately, the broth and noodles are not tasty nor are they authentic.   Hopefully with some retooling the young cook can improve his broth as I would love to see him succeed."}
{"text":"This place use to be a sushi place and it was good . But hey it's ramen now so we'll give it a try. We came in on a Thursday around 740p for a party of 4 and already there's a 30mins wait. The area isn't that big so I get it. We did get seated in 20mins but took the server 10mins before she even came and took our order.   I'm definitely not happy with the service, very slow took forever to get appetizers! A second server came to check on us finally but to tell us our ticket was dropped, but it's been put in now, omg this is crazy we literally sat here for 40mins before they even came to notify us or even check on us.   Don't get me wrong the server was nice but I think if they would of checked on us they would of notice we sat here for now 49mins before our appetizer even got to the table. 20mins later no food and every one that came in after us already got their food, I would think if our ticket was dropped you would push our order up before the people that came in after us but instead they did their order first. The booth behind us even ordered a second round of appetizer and got it before we got our food.   The cook and almost every server did come apologize for the wait but then I don't understand even after they found out we been waiting why did we wait even longer while everyone around us got their food. They gave us 20% off our bill which was cool but again they missed our order but didn't push it up.   2hrs later we are leaving the restaurant. Yes we did get our food and honestly it was good no complaints for that I will give 3 stars but because of the wait it just ruined our appetite."}
{"text":"This is more above a 3 but less than 4, but around the 3.5 mark.  Nishikawa Ramen is located in a somewhat (I think) odd/unassuming location. As a matter of fact, the first time I came here I thought that they were closed. The interior is quaint and you can tell they're a no frills type of place. You can watch the cooks make your ramen and set up your bowls. There's a bar-top-like sitting area, a few booths and a few tables.  Firstly the food. Today I had the Nishikawa black ramen as well as their Chashu bowl and a bottle of Orion beer. Their ramen is good, no doubt about it. The broth was rich and the noodles were springy. You can tell they really pay attention to their bread and butter. If it was only ramen I'd probably give them 4.5-5; however, I feel like it's slightly muddled by their bowls and their service.  The bowls make up about 40% of their menu (more than the ramen and more than the \"tapas\"). Since I've been frequenting Nishikawa, I've had their chashu, ikura, katsu, mentaiko, as well as spicy tuna bowls. The problem is I feel like they have nothing particularly special about them. Nothing stands out and their flavors tend to disappear from memory. Every single bowl I've had came with a cherry tomato and a wedge of lemon (which I don't think is quite a necessity). The chashu pork is very thin and almost tastes like unagi that you can typically get at a sushi restaurant. I feel like you can get better bowls at Tampopo in Tempe. I'm not saying a ramen place should have the best bowls in town but if it takes up most of the menu then maybe it's something to work on and think about.  The service itself is not bad. The employees are kind and attentive. Service is just slow. Every time I've been to Nishikawa it has never been busy nor full; however, I've waited on average around 5-10 minutes standing around to have them seat me or even take notice of me. Checks either come too early or too late, and today I received my beer about 5 minutes after I received all of my food and begun eating. Again the service itself isn't bad, I just think they could use a little more refining.  I clearly frequent this location. If I didn't like it I wouldn't be here, but as stated earlier it's only their ramen that I feel like does them justice. I definitely would recommend this to other people, but again just for their ramen."}
{"text":"The Yokohama with a soft boiled egg is almost as good as San Diego ramen. Get it spicy to really enjoy it!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic as others have said.  The portions here are also pretty filling, especially if you get extra ramen on the side.  That being said the server here was nice and checked in on us several times.  It was a little difficult to find, as it's in a small corner of a strip mall but it was worth searching for as the Tonkotsu ramen was delicious.  The egg and pork were so flavorful!  If you're in the east valley, check this place out.  It's reasonably priced and has great food."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The black is sooooo good so happy to have this close to home. Best pork belly I have had in ramen in a while!!"}
{"text":"You don't serve a 15 dollar bowl of ramen in a cheap plastic bowl! Plastic bowls don't retain heat! Besides my cheap bowl sliding all over the table while trying to consume my once upon a time hot soup it was pretty good ramen, except the chasu was overboiled and disintegrating into the broth, it was worth trying except If I would have known a soup place didn't know how to serve soup I wouldn't have bothered, another hopeful ramen expedition failure! not worth a return visit as well"}
{"text":"I've been there tiwce in a week when I was in AZ. Food over there are unforgettable, owner was so nice and cute highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is alright. I'm from Hawaii where there's obviously many of the best Asian restaurants in the world (besides Asia of course). It's the closest restaurant we can find that doesn't really f*** up a good spicy miso ramen. In Hawaii, we have Sapporo style miso ramen which is delicious. You'll agree with me that this place is just okay if you've tried Hawaii, Japan, or Cali ramen. Their takoyaki was good but I was disappointed by how little they give of actual tako (octopus) that was inside the balls. Their ramen broth is somewhat inconsistent. One night it was salty. The other night it wasn't as salty. Their ramen is creamy and fatty (how I like it). It's not like watered down or see through like some other ramen places. This restaurant is small so don't be coming in here all the time with parties of 10 and being all loud. Be respectful to people who are eating by themselves or on a date with their loved one. Prices ($) are reasonable here. I can tell that the gyoza is the frozen kind from the Asian store. I would like this place more if they sold homemade pork and cabbage gyoza. Other than that, 3 stars. Also, for their chicken karaage (please don't call it breaded chicken or chicken karage, you will hurt my ears), I wish they served it with Siracha-Mayo sauce. Not a sweet peanut sauce."}
{"text":"Friendly staff unfortunately the food wasn't good..as a matter of fact we all became sick"}
{"text":"Good food but to be honest I'd fear for my health eating here.  Just an example this pic of the toilet. There was a piece of chicken or something on the grounds next to the disgusting toilet that was literally rotted and looks like it's been there for months.  Not good.  The Mexican girl that works there is fantastic. Apparently she doesn't do the toilets."}
{"text":"Finally writing a review after dining here a few time. I've gotten the Nishikawa Black twice and Spicy Tonkotsu once. Also tried the deep fried Spring Rolls when I dine-in last night.  The Spicy Tonkotsu was nice, but it didn't leave a lasting impression on me as much as the Nishikawa Black. The Nishikawa Black is one of the best bowl of ramen I've eaten in AZ. The flavorful broth combined with the fresh noodles, and chashu will leave you wanting seconds after you completely slurp up the last drop of broth.   My only gripe is the consistency of the broth. I've tried the Black both at lunch and dinner. The  broth tends to get more concentrated and salty during dinner. The difference in ramen experience between lunch and dinner can be annoying. My friends that tried the ramen also noticed the difference."}
{"text":"Nishikawa doesn't take reservations. I came in at 7:25PM on a Saturday night and I was second on the waitlist. The wait wasn't too long at all. The service was average - there were only two servers present. One was really helpful and checked in on us, the other said that she will come back to take our order but never did.   I ordered takoyaki (5/5 stars), yakohama style ramen (4/5 stars) and the Nishiwaka black ramen (3.5/5 stars). Both the Yakohama and Nishikawa were so different. Y had curly yellow noodles and the N had white straight noodles. I definitely preferred the straight noodles. Broth - N was saltier than Y. I think that's why I gave Nishiwaka a 3.5 stars. Portion size - it was bigger than expected and was not able to finish it. The chashu portion was good too.   This places has tons of free parking outside. No patio. No dogs allowed. I would definitely be back for the takoyaki and when I do, I want to try one of the donburi - small portion and priced accordingly."}
{"text":"2nd Round here..   They reduced the menu option by a lot..  Making it simple so they can grow and evolve into their original expectations.   Nishikawa Ramen.  great flavor again similar to the Tonkatsu with few extra ingredients..  added chili that they have on tables now,  not sure if experimental or long term,  looked lime fresh ground thai chili..  nice uplift to soup that was pretty good already..  (eggs overcooked a lil,  yoke not soft n runny,  but i saw a negative post someone saying its raw that way..  whatever)  next time will ask for a raw'er egg that has a runny yoke.   Wife got Chashu Don..  we were hoping this was more like Kakuni,  but it wasnt.  Flavor was still good,  rice cooked good,    Good job correcting the issues.. Staff way more attentive..  keep it up n hope you guys stick around..   goto dish so far,  Spicy Tinkatsu n side Karaage.."}
{"text":"I'm in chandler visiting my brother\"\" craving ramen yelp it  & came across this place bomb.com I'm from San Francisco live in Oakland we have great ramen joints Nishikawa is just as good! I got miso ramen delish flavor city"}
{"text":"I know a lot Ramen places but most of them are located in SF Bay Area. This place is so good and it was totally out of my expectation. Their food quality can definitely compete with Japanese Ramen restaurants in SF Bay Area.  Besides food, their service is nice and friendly. That's another reason that I gave them 5 stars."}
{"text":"best gyoza in phoenix/metro area!!! delicious!!  fast service,clean restaurant, amazing food!"}
{"text":"Great ramen - we ordered the black garlic and the standard ramen bowls with soft eggs (you have to specify) My brother ordered extra noodles for a small fee. We also ordered the squid balls and dumplings to share, all very authentic and tasty.  It was very busy for Saturday lunch and felt like there was only 1 server for the whole restaurant with just 1 busboy. Please support your staff and hire more servers so the service can improve! I am not going to deduct stars for that since it wasn't just her fault that waters were spare and the requests had to be gently reminded...she had a lot going on!"}
{"text":"Wow! Took me forever to finally try this place and I'm glad I did. Never had true authentic ramen before and there was sooo much flavor I've been missing out on. I was hesistent and worried it would have a strong pork flavor. But it was really good rich flavorful. I tried the black ramen with soft boil egg and added corn. So good. Service was okay. Food came out slow. But food was tasty."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends. The water tasted fantastic. Had the Nishikawa Black Bowl - it was excellent. 10/10 would come again."}
{"text":"My most favorite ramen shop that actually tastes authentic!! This place is a heaven sent lol. It's so close to home compared to the Chandler location, makes it super convenient/accessible. The flavors are amazing and complex in each individual ramen bowl, the noodles perfect amount of softness, pork chasu literally melts in your mouth!! They really do out a lot of work/passion into making the ramen, they cook it for at least 24 hours so you know it's going to be good!!! I really love this place so much & I heard they do delivery.. I will be visiting a lot more frequently. This is my ultimate go to ramen shop"}
{"text":"It was great service and the food was so yummy! Recommend the green tea!!!!  will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Awesome Japanese food. Reminds me of my LA days. Try there ramens especially spicy tonkutsu. 5 on 5. Best in PHOENIX. I am glad I found this gem"}
{"text":"This has now become my favorite ramen spot. Their curry ramen and miso ramen have so far been my favorites to choose between! I am so glad there's this spot so I can satisfy my craving of missing tatsu ramen out in CA, definitely can compare the two! This new location is a lot more close to home! The employees are so welcoming and radiate such a positive atmosphere within, definitely enjoy returning back to fill up my stamp card for the free bowl of ramen!!!"}
{"text":"Glad the area now has a good ramen joint! It's not something I was painfully aware that we were lacking, but now that it's there...I definitely appreciate it.  I came in around dinner time on Saturday, and it was busy, but there were still a few seats available. The place isn't big, but they've got a good layout to maximize tables. Food comes out really quick - which helps with the turnover rate, I think.  I kind of had my heart set on trying the fried squid (Ika Geso), so I got that. My server had a lot of good suggestions in terms of ramen, and highly recommended the Nishikawa Black. I do the opposite and order the Yokohama Style, which wasn't a bad idea but I probably should have gone with the recommendation. The fried squid was okay, a decent balance between the crunchy and the chewy. The sauce was like a miso mayo type of dip, and it was alright too. Overall, the fried squid was just good. I may order again, I may not. Who knows.  Anyways, on to the important part! The Yokohama was pretty good, and I wasn't mad about it. It didn't leave me as satisfied as I thought it would though, and I felt like it could have used more chashu (which was delicious, by the way). The broth was very mild in flavor. I will definitely be trying the Nishikawa Black next time!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, my favorite Ramen place in the east valley.  I usually get the nishikawa black or spicy tonkatsu with soft boiled egg.  Just perfect!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open and  that was worth every minute. The service is good and attentive. The ramen was amazing. The broth had so much flavor and I add spice. That option is awesome by the way. I went for medium, which adds a nice kick.  The portion size was just right and filling. They are still waiting on their liquor license. When that happens that will be a great match.  This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Started with house sake bomber  and pot stickers, went to Gyoza and original Ramen. All great! Well be back. Only problem,  had to sit at the bar cause all tables were full."}
{"text":"I'm super stoked to have ramen in this part of town! We went tonight at 8 p.m. on a Friday evening. The dining area had every table full so we had to wait 20 minutes. The service was very attentive to our table so I was happy with that. The interior is intimate with a long seating area on the bar to the left, tables in the middle, and 4 booths to the right. I loved all the Japanese decorations and cool kitchen area you can peek into.   We ordered chicken karaage and gyoza for appetizers and miso ramen and tonkatsu ramen for our entrees. Our food all came out simultaneously, which was a little annoying bc we felt rushed trying to enjoy our appetizers knowing our ramen was sitting there.   The chicken karaage came out in a surprisingly large portion, served hot and crispy with a side house made mayo/sesame paste type sauce. I was told this is one of their most requested appetizers. The gyoza looked like no other gyoza dish I've ever seen with a fried crispy layer that binds the gyoza pieces together. (See photo).  It was crispy and yet still soft from being steamed, and had a decent savory taste.   My miso ramen came with soft boiled eggs which I love, corn, green onions, and succulent soft roasted pork cha siu which had the right amount of meat to fat ratio. The miso broth was thick and the noodles, which are made in-house, were plentiful.    My husband got the tonkatsu pork broth and I liked his bowl better. The broth was delightfully savory and not oily or watered down. I can't say it's the best tonkatsu ramen I've ever had, but it was still enjoyable. I'll get the tonkatsu ramen next time.  Overall, we left pleased, but weren't \"blown away.\" But it was good enough to come back to satisfy our ramen cravings. Being so close to home, I'm happy they're here and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in Phoenix for sure! Somewhat small space, but modern and casual. I had the Curry Ramen, SOFT boiled egg, medium spicy, and the Chicken Karrage on the side. Next time I will opt for one of the more traditional broths, for some reason I was envisioning yellow curry. This was more of a red curry, but STILL delicious. The pork broth has a great Umami flavor. Would love a ramen bowl with Chicken Karrage already in it, that's why I got the Chicken Karrage appetizer. I was trying to copycat another place in San Fransisco that does it like that. The peanut sauce the chicken came with was pretty tasty. All in all, if you are looking for a great ramen place in Phoenix, this is it! And worth the trip!  P.S. Medium spicy was nice. I like things spicy, this had a nice amount of spice, while not overpowering the flavor of the dish."}
{"text":"Been coming here quite often, still amazing ramen. The curry is basically the best ever and the karaage chicken is great. The bowls are a great option for lunches as they're smaller and very affordable. Will probably be back tonight!"}
{"text":"Found this place by chance and we are so glad we did. Great ramen and our kids enjoyed the pot stickers."}
{"text":"We came here one evening after seeing the amazing reviews. The ramen was just as expected and very delicious. The place is quaint and often full of people- which is a good sign! We had a great experience with the customer service and the quick food times. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"They told customers that they run out of ramen.  Also the servers and the cooks are super confused with orders and I think they spent more time arguing with each other which belongs who than actually cooking."}
{"text":"I've been to Nishikawa about 4 times now and each time the food is fantastic. They open until 10 so it's real convenient with my work schedule. I order the nishikawa black but I ask them to make it extra spicy."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tonkatsu soup, the broth was creamy but what makes or breaks a bowl of ramen for me is the pork. The pork was cooked perfectly! Our server was really attentive and friendly. The customer service was superb, they even offered us free red bean ice cream they were testing out. Also each table had a different table decor which added a cute touch."}
{"text":"I was expecting not to like Nishikawa. I went in to my visit with some negative feelings. The first time I came to visit, they were supposed to be open, but they weren't. To put this in perspective, I drove 60 miles roundtrip for nothing. I was not thrilled.    Needless to say, I waited awhile and made sure to call before making a return visit. Even then, their hours were crazy... I had planned to go one day, called, only to find they were closed again.   So fast forward to my actual visit. I called to verify they were open. I drove over and was pleasantly surprised by their cute little shop. I tried the gyoza... very good. They are clearly made in house and came out hot, crispy, and delicious. I ordered the tonkotsu and asked for it spicy. The ramen was legit. The broth was tasty with a good amount of heat. It had kikurage mushroom in it, which I really like. The meat was a thick slice that was perfectly tender. Overall, the ramen was worth coming back for.....would be a solid 4 star if their hours were more consistent."}
{"text":"I came here with the lover so that we can try out the ramen together.   I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and added corn. I requested for curved noodles instead of straight noodles. I liked the broth and the noodles here. The pork was also very good but there was definitely not enough of it. They also gave me the wrong noodles even though I requested for the curved noodles in the beginning. I thought the portioning was perfect because I actually finished my entire bowl. My fiancé thought the portion was too small though because he was still hungry when we left.   I really did enjoy the broth and their noodles, however I was disappointed in the selection of toppings that they had. It was very limited. And there was also not enough pork."}
{"text":"I'd like to first state that the food was actually very good, but I usually never take stars for food, I take stars over service. The first thing we ordered was takoyaki appetizer. It came out just great,  but as an appetizer,  you usually share it with someone.  My girlfriend was with me and the waitress did not bring out any plates to share, she did not even ask if we needed any extra plates, we had to slide the dish back and fourth. The one thing that really upset me was the next table over also got an appetizer,  and their waitress did offer them some plates to share. Besides that the ramen itself was pretty good.  UPDATE  I came back a second time and I noticed it again but didn't mention it in my first review. I noticed that the tables and menus have this kind of funk to them, like they were wiped down with a rag that hasn't been cleaned in awhile. It is very musty, which throws off the whole experience. Also the agedashi tofu was pretty terrible. This is the first time I've had agedashi tofu where they used firm tofu instead of soft tofu."}
{"text":"Literally best ramen in Arizona. The food reminded me a lot of the ramen in Japan while the restaurant itself reminded me of the ramen shops in Melbourne. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Best bowl of Ramen in the whole area and I flirt. I travel about an hour to go here. I like the miso Ramen with some heat in it."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Ramen I've had since I've moved to Arizona two years ago. I like the miso Ramen with some added bamboo and some heat. I also like the iced green tea."}
{"text":"Amazing! The veggie ramen was great and the seasoned egg on top was perfect! Everything was really good, a must try place!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, which was delicious, but 3 stars for the service.    We got Yokohama style ramen, a fried chicken rice bowl, and some gyoza.  The gyoza and ramen were delicious, and the chicken was decent.  The waitresses were very kind and helpful, but they obviously needed more help.  I got my ramen about 5 min after I ordered it.  About 10 min later the waitress walked close enough by that I could ask for some chopsticks/silverware.  5 min after that the gyoza arrived.  This was some of the best I've ever had!  10 minutes later, after the ramen and gyoza were nearly completely gone, my wife's chicken arrived.  We had pretty much assumed that they had forgotten the chicken and we were almost ready to leave by the time we got it...  Even though the service was not great, I'll probably go back just bc the ramen and gyoza were so good...  that's what it's all about I guess."}
{"text":"The ramen is excellent.  You can order it without some of the ingredients if you don't care for seaweed for instance.  You can also order mild, medium or hot.  It's nice that you can customize by adding and deleting ingredients in the ramen.  I am constantly craving this place now. The pork gyoza rock!  They are nicely seared on both sides and the sauce is really tasty! I hope to find this place on some of the delivery services like UberEats."}
{"text":"Simple, yet satisfying! It's my birthday and the fam wanted to take me for dinner but I wanted to make sure there would be something for everyone (I have one very picky eater). We walked in about 6pm and it was not busy at all. I actually believe it was just us and another table. We sat down and was brought some menus. The menus are very limited but they specialize on what they have. We ordered pork gyozas, chicken karaage, tonkatsu ramen, plain ramen and a karaage bowl. Everything was flavorful and the portions was big, well the karaage bowl was small but filling and for the price, you can't complain. Everyone on our table was happy, including the picky eater who originally ordered just rice. She loved the ramen and already had plans to go back. I even ordered an extra bowl of rice and took the chicken home so I can have it for lunch tomorrow. We're glad we made it in and will be back!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to when we are craving a nice, warm, and hearty soup. I must say we have never actually been into the restaurant, we always use doordash, grubhub, or Postmates to deliver from here, so I can't speak to the inside of the restaurant. But I definitely recommend any and every soup combination that they have. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved it. I've been to the other location many times so this is a superb addition to my hood.  Had the Yokohama Ramen with without bean sprouts, just the way I like it.   The ice green tea was a little sweet for my taste but very flavorful.   Only negative.. the floor was a tiny bit slippery. Like it got a lazy mopping.    Easy fix though.   Thanks for opening in the area. Service and food were yummy."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen! Food tasted great and was very authentic! Got the miso and potstickers and both were very tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen place and I especially love their tuna don. Flavourful and fresh without being too big of a portion. Their okinawa milk tea is DELICIOUS!!! A must try if you're into milk tea. A small and convenient location to my house. Will be regulars!"}
{"text":"It's a great small place in the neighborhood. Chickrn Karaage was bit too much corn starch & not much meat but the dipping sauce was great. Very flavorful! Ramen was cook well but the broth was a bit salty. Flavoring ia great. I would however cut the nori into smaller piece.  My nori was one big piece/half a sheet. I ordered Miso Ramen after eating Yokohama but the miso Ramen didn't have the miso flavor because the base broth was too over powering. Oh, the menu has changed...I think. Don't go by the menu posted on yelp pictures. Here's the new or current one."}
{"text":"Did you know that \"ramen\" is the Japanese word for Chinese \"lo mein?\"  There are definitely things I love about this place and other stuff I could pass on. Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back.  So the ramen here is pretty interesting. While I do prefer my ramen on the thicker side, and this place caters to this style, the texture was different. It doesn't get soggy even though I'm a pretty slow eater so it's good for me. Cooked al dente, the noodles holds the sauce really well so the texture works. I just haven't seen ramen like this! The broth in the Nishikawa Black is rich and flavorful although a bit oily from the sesame oil. The soft-boiled egg was perfect! You can tell they gently poached the egg in sauce and not just boil it in water. I also like that their cha shu was more reminiscent of a fatty roulade style and cut a little thicker like ramen houses in California.   I would pass on the takoyaki and agedashi tofu if I were to be honest. While eating both appetizers, I had commented that it tasted more like Chinese food (not a bad thing but I was expecting Japanese food, y'know?) and later learned that the chef was from Hong Kong. The takoyaki seemed like it was deep fried like a fish ball consistency with Chinese house chicken sauce. The agedashi tofu was more like silken tofu than crunchy.   If I came back, I would like try their pot stickers with the beautiful lattice bottoms and the calamari. All in all, I wouldn't mind coming back but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to stop in. The price point is also a bit high compared to other ramen houses in the valley. 3.5 stars at best.  Also, don't forget to ask to get the soft-boiled egg or risk getting a hard boiled one!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had tried this place once before, but couldn't remember if we liked it or not, which caused some uncertainty in trying it again. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The Tonkotsu Ramen wasn't too bad, considering this side of town is lacking in a ramen place to begin with (although I wouldn't say it is the best in the valley). The broth was delicious and flavorful. I don't always care for the pork, but for others: the protein serving is small. Overall serving size was pretty decent! We also had the Takoyaki, and it was absolutely yummy!  Server was attentive, and was a good sport during our little squabble of who was taking care of the bill--although she sided w the man ._. lol great service though.   All in all, everyone has different taste, and while it is especially true with ramen, I say give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Super yummy ramen! I like the Tonkatsu to go. Love that they are right around the corner, affordable and quick!"}
{"text":"Placed an order for pickup and it was ready before I arrived. Tonkatsu ramen is delicious! Broth is nice and creamy and the size of the portion was perfect."}
{"text":"The food and service were good. Staff was attentive and the food had good flavor. Family all liked the food. If you like Pho this will stay in line as a Japanese alternative. Really did enjoy but not a lot of options. Very small menu."}
{"text":"Great bowl of ramen, we had Nishikawa Black and Tonkatsu, both were excellent. Broth was delicious, noodles were perfect. Small, attractive local restaurant with prompt service and they serve beer and sake."}
{"text":"Ok, where do I start.    First it is Father's day.  Ask my father where he wants to go and his friend recommended this place.    Sunday, the 19th of June, record breaking heat of 120 degrees.   We should have turned around and left once we felt the temperature of this place, which was about 90+.  It a sad day in a restaurant, when the patrons in the establishment have to tell them to turn down the thermostat or turn on a fan.  Asked if they could turn down the heat and they told me that they just had the A/C fixed, but still wasn't turned down.    Second, ordered the chashu bun with pork.  Did you ever microwave a bun and then after words the bread is hard as a rock.  Well there you go.    Lastly, the ramen.  Ordered 2 different types.  Original and spicy.  It came out and it looked original to me and asked them about it and they stated that there was spice on the table.  A little bit later my spicy one came out.  Go figure.    Don't think that I will recommend this place and the noodles wasn't up to par.    Only good thing was our waitress."}
{"text":"I wanted soup and saw this place on Yelp. Based on the reviews, decided to try it plus it's less than a mile from my house. The restaurant was clean, atmosphere good. I actually ordered takeout so I only got to see all that when I went in to pick it up. The flavor of the broth was good and the pork was very tender. The curly noodles we're yummy. I'm just not sure I'm a real fan of ramen. It was a little salty for my taste."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this location. My friends and family came with me and recommended this place. I attempted to order the Karaage Bowl last week, and there was no rice ( In a Japanese restaurant) so I changed my ordered. So now I visited today, and attempted to order the same bowl a week later... and yet again.... NO RICE! And we called to make sure there was before we arrived. This will be my last attempt to eat in this establishment, due to the simple fact there is never rice!"}
{"text":"Very simple Japanese Ramen Restaurant that reminds me of a ramen house restaurant in San Diego off Convoy Road.  I liked the Ichiro Jersey hanging on the wall towards the back of the restaurant. Also. Nice to have a carafe of ice filled water, loved the metal cups that kept the water super cold.  We ordered the Tapas - Pork Gyozas, Tonkatsu Ramen and the Shio Ramen. When ordering the Ramen, would suggest requesting the soft boiled egg that comes with it or they will give you a hard boiled egg.  The broth for the ramen was very good, nice and hot. You could order the ramen with either the straight noodles which are made in house daily or the curled egg noodles. We tried each with different ramen and both were very good.  Tonkotsu Ramen consist of  Pork broth, pork chashu, green onion, kikurage, seasoned egg, fish powder, sesame. Served with straight noodles  Shio Ramen consist of Pork broth, pork chashu, green onion, menma, seasoned egg. Served with straight noodles  Pork Gyozas are Pan fried pot stickers with pork and veggies, served with ponzu sauce.  Overall, had a very nice experience and enjoyed the ramen, one of the better ramen house restaurants in town, too bad it is +25 miles from where I live."}
{"text":"Nisakawa Ramen  Recently opened restaurant on 32nd Street just South of Indian School Road from their original location on Ray Road and Cooper.  Had the Pork Gyozas and Tonkatsu Ramen Bowl.  The Tonkatsu Ramen Bowl consist of Pork broth, pork chashu, green onion, kikurage, seasoned egg, fish powder, sesame served with straight noodles and a hard-boiled egg. Very good ramen bowl with a nice tasting broth which is about the most important thing about the ramen to me.  The Pork Gyozas are made up of pork and veggies served with ponzu sauce. Love how they make one side crisp and just perfectly cooked.  This location is very modern and just opened recently, I kind of like the Chandler location charm and think the food there is a little better there than the new location."}
{"text":"My first visit, I went to lunch. I was seated immediately. I had the spicy miso ramen, medium heat. Just the right amount of spice. It was soooo good! I definitely  will be back."}
{"text":"It has been over a year since their grand opening. I figure this is definitely a good time to give it a try again. We arrived at approximately 1pm in the afternoon on Saturday. There was only 1 waitress hosting and serving table. I've got to give it to her .... it wasn't easy.   We ordered two green tea and two ramen noodles for lunch. Mine was the Miso Ramen. The broth was average tasting, noodle was a bit too chewy for my taste and the pork portion was very little. I was a bit disappointed especially after tasting delicious ramen noodle at a trip to Tokyo last year. It just wasn't the same.   Everyone has a different taste & preference on how they like their ramen. Just because it isn't for me doesn't mean you wouldn't like it. Give this place a try and perhaps you will like it better than we do. I wish this business establishment the best and looking forward to visit again in the future."}
{"text":"I haven't really been to a ramen place before. This is a nice little place. Wait staff will BH to explain and recommend dishes. Would come again"}
{"text":"Really cool joint. Really good food. I had the Spicy tuna dish and added some red pepper for additional kick. It was so F'ing delicious. Sake bombers on a Sunday afternoon? Sure! Also delicious. The wife got vegetarian ramen, it was also delicious. Very friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"A good bowl of ramen, especially considering there aren't many choices of ramen shops around this area. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and the pork itself was not great. It was hard to bite and I felt the need for a knife and fork. The broth was pretty good and I loved the soft boiled egg. The noodles were well cooked and tasted fresh. I like how they give you a carafe of water on the table as well. The restaurant itself is small and quaint and I enjoyed eating in. The takoyaki was pretty good. If you're craving takoyaki it will definitely curb the craving, but they deep fry their takoyaki so it's a bit different than what you would get in Japan. All in all it was pretty delicious and I'm very happy there is a Japanese restaurant in town. Try it out!!"}
