{"text":"Just terrible!  My wife and I bought a gift certificate from restaurant.com and in the fine print it clearly says order $20 of food and get $10 off your order.  Well, when I went to pick up iur food, the woman at the counter just kept repeating \"no take, no take, no take\".  I had her call her manager and he got on the phone.  The manager barley spoke any English (just like the woman at the counter) and he said I needed to order $30 worth of food for the $20 gift certificate to work.  It was pointless trying to explain to him all of the details and he wouldn't honor the gift certificate.  Waste of time and left hungry.  Do not waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to be aware of how HORRIBLE Pizza Vespucci really is. Although their food is okay at best, and I really don't understand how it has 4 stars on Google, the service I have had with them has been absolutely appalling and I feel the need to share so others do not order from them in the future.

The first time we ever ordered from Pizza Vespucci, we got two fettuccine alfredo pastas. They came and the Alfredo sauce was not Alfredo sauce at all, but a watery, milky liquid with noodles. Obviously upset, I called and told them the problem, they insisted we keep it as evidence for them to take back while we wait for the remade food to arrive (obviously not an issue to return the horrid food, who wants to eat noodles in milk water?)

So when the remade food arrives an hour later, it looks and tastes how it SHOULD have came the first time. Fine, consistent Alfredo, not watery. Manager called to tell me he made it himself. Awesome. Well, his employees should still know how to make food.

Recently, even though we did have that experience, we wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and order from them again. Some places have bad nights, I can understand. But no. 

This time, I ordered beef ravioli and my significant other just wanted soup. They FORGOT MY BEEF RAVIOLI. Actually, apparently one of the guys didn't even ring the ravioli into the order. But somehow they managed to remember to bring the garlic bread! When I called to complain, they asked if I still wanted my ravioli. No, I just ordered it for no reason...

I'll never order from there again. It'd be easier to cook at five-course meal at home than deal with Pizza Vespucci."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever we had there. And they have halal meat in their food, too, which is good for our health."}
{"text":"Its better than chain stores pizza...  P.H....LIL Cs. If you know what i mean..quit being haters wont get you no where.. busy as usual...never had a problem..."}
{"text":"Over the last few years my family has had several lengthy stays @ UPMC Mercy.  This restaurant is our go to for takeout.  The nursing staff made the recommendation.

I always order the staff a XL pizza and it feeds the entire shift.

I love their calzones.

And the best part, the delivery drivers deliver to the patient's room .... quickly."}
{"text":"I have eaten every type of food they offer from salads to pizza and hoagies.  I have ordered more times than i can count and look forward to my next order. This is my favorite place to order from downtown and I recommend it to and guests at my work looking for best local pizza place. I have never had a bad experience from this place and the food tastes very good and homemade. They even make their own salad dressings. I Recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"For just $20, I was able to buy a large pie, a 16\" hoagie, and a 2 liter soda.  How is that possible?  Unfortunately, both food items were tasteless and embarrassing.  The worst pizza I ever ate was in a suburb of Dallas in 1989 but this was pretty close to that.  Even the ranch dressing was tasteless.  Does Sysco have a low-end generic brand too?"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Hadn't eaten all day after a busy day at work and thought I'd get a pizza and fries delivered.   Checked in two hours after ordering when I  hadn't received my food and they said it would be here in another 25 minutes.  Another hour went by, it's now midnight and my food never came after 3 hours of waiting.  Canceled the order and will never ever give them a cent.  They can't deliver a pepperoni pizza and fries 5 minutes away in under 3 hours.  You can't even call to say you're running behind to make sure you're not ruining someone's night by not delivering their dinner before midnight?  I don't care how busy you might be that is pathetic.  What a joke."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a good pizza place in downtown Pittsburgh but Vespucci's is my favorite so far. Decent pizza and fast delivery."}
{"text":"The pizza was very good for sure. I had a couple slices and was craving some more. If you're looking for halal pizza this is a great place!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Vespuccis at least twice a week for the last few months. The food isn't bad, it's pretty much the same fare that your average Pittsburgh Central Asian pizza shop will offer you, but it's reasonably priced and the service has always been friendly. They also stock deserts from Cheesecake Factory. Don't let the other review get you down, they're worth  a try."}
{"text":"Avoid this restaurant at all costs. We went there to break our fast during Ramadan and ordered food and grape leaves to start. We were told the food would take 15-20 minutes to arrive, then the cashier went to the back to prepare our food after giving us the grape leaves. They were horrible (congealed layer of oil on top). So bad that after a day of fasting my daughter and I couldn't eat more than a bite. Next two young men arrived soon after us. Keep in mind this restaurant was completely empty on a weekend night during Ramadan (unusual for halal places). The young men went straight to the kitchen and were laughing and chatting with the cashier/chef. Soon thereafter we could smell marijuana smoke mixed with the smell of our food. We made the decision to just leave at that point, again after 16 hours of fasting leaving was more appealing than remaining there."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Called in an order and they couldn't understand me, so our order was not even ready when I called an hour before pick up. When we arrived, besides being informed that our food was not ready, we were also told that they didn't have one of the items we order....so needless to say, I will never be back here. Plus, we had to sit in the smoky restaurant, from oven smoke, not ciggys, while our eyes burned! Terrible experience!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick bite to eat.  We ordered from here and service was fairly quickly.

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad.  This consisted of a mixture of iceberg lettuce and mixed greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, buffalo chicken, buffalo fries, buffalo sauce and then topped off with mozzarella.  As my dressing I asked for ranch because I knew that would cool the spiciness down a bit.  I was wrong.  The buffalo sauce is more like buffalo oil.  It overpowered just about everything in the salad.  The cucumbers didn't stand a chance against it.  It tasted good, but I ended up paying for it later that day and the next.

I'm not knocking them over this, I just know now that next time ordering from here to go with something else.  Nobody wants to fire coming out of that end...ever."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food pretty well. The stuffed shells were quite good even though the sauce was fairly watery, but the problem I had was that they had a tough time understanding me when I placed the order, then when the order came, a guy who barely spoke passable English called to tell me that the deliver had arrived at my hotel. I asked where I needed to pick it up. He just said okay and went to hang up the phone and so, knowing I wouldn't be likely to get anything else out of him, I said fine and I hung up as well. When I couldn't find him, I called the number he had dialed me from back and no one picked up. When I made my way to where he was waiting, I asked him for change for a ten to give him a better tip, since all I had was a twenty and the food was like $17.95 or something. He just looked at me. He obviously spoke a tiny bit of English. He could've said I'm sorry, I don't understand you, but he didn't. He just stared at me. I slowly explained the situation and asked if he understood and he continued to stare. I pulled a ten out of my wallet and said okay, you give me one five and five ones. I even counted on my fingers (not to be rude or insulting, but to try to demonstrate what I was saying). He took my ten and only gave me a five and two ones. I said no,  I need five ones and I once again demonstrated that to him by holding up five fingers and pointing to the ones in his hand. He didn't do anything. I just gave him the $7 back and took my ten and left him with a twenty. I felt badly for giving him a $2 tip, but I literally had no choice. I apologized profusely, but short of ripping the money out of his hand (and you can probably imagine how well that would've gone over) and forcing my money into his pocket, there was nothing I could do. I feel terrible, but it seems like maybe an English as a second language training program or something might be a good thing for this restaurant to implement. I respect the fact that they're hiring workers from other countries, but let's make sure they have the proper training, shall we? This poor guy has a tough job ahead of him."}
{"text":"Ordered food which never came. Very disappointed in the lack of service. Will not be giving my business again. 

1/5 clams."}
{"text":"Vespuccis used to be a favorite. Those days are over. The past two pizzas we've ordered here have been burnt to a crisp and somehow still cold upon delivery. Vespuccis is not what it was. Very sad to see a good place slip."}
{"text":"Been a long, slow, painful wait for a simple order. It wouldn't hurt to have a little consistency with the only thing that you make. But let's hope for a change in pace on the apparent laziness that happens everyday there"}
