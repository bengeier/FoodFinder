{"text":"So this was our first time coming to this place. We read about it in Ming Pao magazine and decided to give it a try. The article was written very positively so we went in there with very high expectations. After trying it out, we assumed that this article was actually a paid advertisement. It was not \"old-style Hong Kong\" like they advertised, and we did not get that feel at all from the environment or the menu. 

The first thing we noticed going in: The decor was very....interesting. The tables were all mismatched and people were very randomly seated and was quite cluttered. It is unfortunate if you come here as a pair, because you will most likely be seated in the narrow and tight dark corridor right outside the washrooms. (We saw many couples immediately leave after they were told to sit in that corridor.)

Now onto the food: We order four \"car jei mein\"- $5.99 (where you can choose a noodle, three toppings- $1 for every extra topping, and a sauce) as well as a side dish \"pig's trotters and ginger in sweetened vinegar\" ($4.50). The side dish came first, but only came after 20 minutes, in this tiny bowl with one egg, 2 pieces of meat, and 2 small pieces of ginger, with minimal sauce. Compared to the magazine picture, it's hard to believe that they were the same dish. 
Next, the noodles came all at separate times (which is odd because they were essentially all the same thing) and they all had different proportions of noodles and toppings. The taste of all of them were not bad, but for the small size of the bowl and its price, it was not worth it. One of the bowls came with a normal amount of noodles, and another came with half the amount of noodles. Another bowl had one piece of beef brisket, whereas the others had 3 (small) pieces. They are quite stingy with the toppings.

And now the service: OH MAN, they need some massive changes; from the server to the manager herself. It took forever just to get a pot of tea on our table, and that's even after asking for it three times. The waitress doesn't know how to multitask and misses a lot of orders. Throughout our whole stay, all we heard was the waitress and the manager talking with each other, quite loudly mind you so we (and everyone else) could hear everything they were saying. They were constantly gossiping and complaining about customers that were just there, or past customers, and we found that to be very inappropriate and unprofessional of them. i.e. the manager had called a past customer a \"fat lady\" or \"fei por\" in Chinese, which is downright disrespectful.

Although the food is not too bad and we hear the desserts are kind of worth trying, service is just as important, and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"After dinner, I was told that this place won the 2014 best HK style milk tea competition.  I'm a big fan of HK style milke tea so, I had to try it out since I was in the plaza.  

$4.50 was the price of the large size which, is the same as any other BBT places but more expensive than your average bakery stores and more importantly, more expensive than last year's winner, Marathon cafe (which is at the plaza down street). 

The verdict, Marathon cafe is better in my opinion.  From what I can tell, the cup and a little portion of the milk tea was semi-frozen.  They than poured more tea on top of it.  Tea was not bad but, a bit too sweet for me.

Will I come back...  yes.  There are actually more Chinese desserts and drinks at this place which looked pretty good.  I will try to make my way here soon and update this review based on other products served here."}
{"text":"Most disgusting restaurant I've been in. The owner of the restaurant is ridiculously rude and obnoxious. Don't even bother coming here lol. I ordered noodles (???) that comes with 3 toppings, so I asked for red sausage and two orders of beef balls. They literally gave me 2 beef balls and 2 red sausages with a bland soy sauce/water based \"soup\". Upon complaining, the owner was condescending and boldly claimed that her beef balls were expensive and told us to leave becasue we were taking up space... Couldn't help but laugh and leave without eating a bite. Disgustinggggggg"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place opened serving the type of food they offer, bc it is not good, bad and worst! I'm not even sure how this place fills up with awkward tables and chairs. The price is a bit steep for what they're offering at lunch and the portion size is more fitted for toddlers... I can't comment on their desserts cuz I didn't have any, but I can comment on the lunch offered.

Had their steam seafood egg with rice $8.5. Small bowl of steam egg with rice...Nothing special.

Manga Shrimp Roll- Turns out there manga sauce overfilled the fried Mango shrimp roll... Tasted dry...Heard lots of Microwave noise.

Ordered their Chicken with some soya sauce mixed with other meat and peanuts. This dish the sauce was decent, but one piece of wing, a few red slice sausage and loads of peanuts does not add up to $10.5.

Got this transparent noodle dry style with crispy shallots...Portion was very small and very bland.

Got their 'Famous Milk Tea' for $4! And it was on a take-out cup that was small. The taste is average, but not the best we've had.

Service is not really existent b/c the poor girl is taking order and running food by herself where the kitchen keeps ringing the bell for her to come pick it up. The food is bad, the service is not average, but I felt bad and still left her a decent tip.

WOULD NOT COME BACK FOR LUNCH OR DINNER....SLIGHT CHANCE FOR DESSERT."}
{"text":"Business owner was extremely blunt and \"inch\". Basically told me I should either eat what they have today (their specials) or not bother at all. It takes her 20 minutes to make rice rolls, and just as long to make anything else on the menu (if they are available at all). It was 1:30pm on a Thursday and there were only me and another table of two women.

I ordered a bowl of noodles. The toppings were few (she gave me two slices of thin red sausages, one fish dumpling, and several slices of veggies) and there weren't a lot of noodles either. It would have been overlooked if the taste was good. Sadly it was mediocre.

I am very turned off by the owner's attitude and the way she treated her staff. She was yelling at the staff while I was waiting to order, and the way she talked was mean. The waitress was fine, though.

Will caution my friends about this place and of course blacklist Aberdeen Delicatessen. If you want to try it out, this place is actually not cheap if you want to be full. $11-30 per person."}
{"text":"If you want to be treated like shit, come here!  I order 'car Jai noodles' and for one of the toppings I chose curry pig skin. I love pig skin but I can't eat too spicy so I asked if the curry pig skin can be serve on the side. At first the waitress why don't u order a side order snack dish. I said no. I don't want that much. I just want it serve in the side. So ok fine. Then I think the owner (fat woman with cap on) came and said car Jai noodles is serve as a whole. I said I can't eat too spicy. That's why. And she said if you can't eat spicy. Why don't u order something else....and continue saying this is not wonton noodle where u put wonton on the top. I was about to ask her how is it is different and how is it not putting toppings on top of noodles. Before I could even open my mouth and asked. She said THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED TO MAKE FOR THE KITCHEN. WE WONT MAKE IT. YOU CAN LEAVE IF U WANT AND THEN TURN HER BACK AND HAD HER ASS ON MY DAD'S FACE!!!!!!!!

enough said. You guys know what to do."}
{"text":"Love their white&black sesame sweet soup, as well as hestnut and cashew sweet soups! 
Just had the durian cream crepe today! Very fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"We go there once a week since it was opened last 2 months. I love the sticky rice with no MSG and cooking with real chicken soup."}
{"text":"I decided to write about this since a lot of my friends have had a bad experience with this place 
- Expensive for garbage quality food and the amount of food you get is dinky. 
- The HK milk tea used to be alright but quality for that has gone down dramatically as well; Marathon Cafe down the street is much better. 
- Poor hygiene used when preparing the food. I don't know how they passed the Public Health Inspection. 
- Boss lady is arrogant and fake which is reflected in the quality of food and service you get.
- Does not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We came here wanting to try HK style snacks. The moment we saw the menu we knew prices were relatively high for what they were serving. In the end we just ordered 3 bowls of noodle which were 8-10 each. The noodles were like 3 bites and sides only had 2 fish ball + other 2.

Pretty dissapointed and shows why the rating is so low for this restaurant. Safe to say won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here and was slightly turned off cause I just saw two children (presumably the owner's) lying on the chairs of the place. I don't think that's an appropriate way to run a business personally. Came here with parents thinking it'd be like a HK style Cafe, but it's not. Not that many options for lunch. There are specials written on the walls but they are only chinese and I'm chinese illiterate so doesn't help. I think this place is more suited for late night hanging out where you and your friends order a bunch of snack/desserts while chatting. 

We ordered the noodles where can choose three toppings and soup base. The toppings were really generic and the soup base (I got the lo shui one.. don't know how to translate to english) wasn't all that great. Also tried the award winning milk tea which was meh. Overall not crazy about this place and little incentive to want to return. 

I do agree with other reviewers that the decor and bowls are cool and reminiscent of HK back in the day but at the end of the day this isn't really supposed to be a museum =/"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place for lunch the other day

Let me start with the positives... services was good and the taste of the noodles we got was decent, decor was interesting, I can tell they were trying to mimic the dai pai dong feel in HK but it falls short of establishing the same atmosphere

I think price is a negative, the price points were quite high for middle of scarborough, the menu design was hard to decipher, and the fact that it is missing some iconic HK style noodles like wonton mein or double fish ball noodle was disappointing

The most deciding factor was the level of hygiene observed by the boss lady. The fact that it was an open kitchen design made it all visible
- fish ball fell onto the hot serving counter and she picked it back up and put into the noodle
- tasted her soup stock with a ladle and proceeds to use the same ladle to scoop soup into the noodle
AND THAT WAS OUR BOWL OF NOODLE!!!

Sorry if it was behind closed doors in a normal kitchen I would've easily ignored it, but that fact that I as a customer could see it all unfold is just unacceptable"}
{"text":"I was expecting a low price Hk style snack.  We had the noodle soup, the soup was terrible, no taste. We also had organs and rice. The organs were marinated poorly.  The street side Siu mai was absolutely terrible.  Tasted like purchased frozen, small and chewy.  Dessert was probably the better of the meal. I expected a light lunch to just try this place out and walked out paying $60 for 3..  when I expected to be paying $35-40.  Interior was a 3 out of 10."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place, feels like being back in HK. But in terms of curry fish balls, it was okay, the rice noodles were mediocre, nothing to write home about. 

My mom had the noodles where you can select your own topping, she kept repeating she can get bigger potion and cheaper at FMP. So I reminded her this is a cool place to check out the ambiance.

The lemon tea, they made a note of the limited quantity per day and so was the milk tea. I find the milk tea tasting better than the lemon tea. 

I would give the ambiance of feeling back in HK of this place a 4, the food and price 3."}
{"text":"Walked by there and saw signs that said they won contests for amazing Hong Kong style tea. 
I don't know where they get the nerve to call the garbage they made tea. It took almost 10 minutes for them to make two cups, on top of which it wasn't even lukewarm and at least half cream. Completely undrinkable. Like they couldn't even have bothered to put it in the microwave to heat up. It's like they just took two cups that was left on the counter for an hour and handed it to me. Except that they took 10 minutes. 
Adding insult to injury, they charged an unreasonably high price for what amounts to a tall from Starbucks. It's the highest price I've ever paid for a cup of tea, which if it were at least decent I wouldn't have minded as much. 
I'm not an expert on milk tea, but I do try it from pretty much every restaurant I go to. This is absolute garbage."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"When it comes to chinese food, I LOVE Dessert Soup. It's hard to find it in downtown Toronto so I'm always on the look out for a bowl of Sesame, Walnut, or Red Bean dessert. I've been in the Finch / Midland area lately and many people have recommended Double Ming because their steamed milk and egg dishes seem to stand out. 

I had planned to stop in Double Ming one afternoon only to find out that they did not open until 3pm.... Really bumbed, I looked to my trusty YELP APP for something comparable nearby.... that is what brought me to Aberdeen.

After driving around in circles, I arrived to this shop that looked really a little suspicious both outside and inside. Green walls, high ceilings and uneven seating, I really was not sure what to expect. The lady was really nice and explained to me what their specialties were and how they made their dessert soups. Based on her recommendation, I tried the Chestnut dessert soup, something I've never seen on the menus and she even brought out warm chestnuts they were toasting in the back. I brought the dessert soup home, warmed it up and was really happy with the overall texture. The dessert soup never separated or became watery. The whole bowl was consistent throughout and the taste was true to the actual chestnut. It wasn't too sweet and not heavy at all. Yes, the colour seems unappetizing (it's brown and gooey).... but don't let it deter you to trying it. 

..........and one week later, I was back at Aberdeen again trying another one of their recommendations - the Pistachio soup. Definitely on the heavier side, and the taste of the nut was not as prominent, but it was still unique and tasty. 

There's more that I want to try so I'm waiting for my next opportunity to get out to East York. For those who want a meal, they serve snacks and soups... definitely attracts the work crowd in that area.

Thanks Double Ming for being closed - helped me found my new favourite Dessert Soup Shop!"}
{"text":"We came for dinner, but were told they were preparing tasting menu for the customers and there weren't much choices we could have for dinner.  We agreed on what they suggested that were available.  The portion was small and a bit pricey.  
We ordered a few desserts.  The first dessert arrived was the lychee tea pudding.  I was expecting the pudding was in cubes, but instead, it came in a bowl.  It was rich in tea taste.  The crepe was too thick.  The dessert soup was the best.   It was rich in taste, smooth and very delicious.  I will give 2 stars for the dinner and 5 for the dessert soup. Will go back for the dessert soup and try their milk tea."}
{"text":"Horrendous brisket soup, $6.99.
Subpar mango dessert, $6.

This resto/HK snack café is not run by 
a chef!

It was a bad excuse for restaurant!"}
{"text":"I really like the decor here. If you pay attention to the details in this place you will see there's items from the early 1970s to the current trends in HK. There's the mini guitar set that reminds me of pubs at Lan Kwai Fong. The bowls that served the desserts were the same ones that were used in the late 1970s for sweet desserts in HK. 

Now onto the food, I gotta say it's really not that great. I ordered the mango dessert with grapefruit and aloe. The presentation was nice, but the grapefruit was really bitter. This type of dessert was meant to use Thailand grapefruit because its much sweeter and has a tang to it. But this place probably used local grapefruits which can be bitter. The dessert I had wasn't too sweet which I don't mind. If it wasn't for the white stuff on the side of the dessert, I wouldn't of noticed any aloe in my dessert. 

Mommy ordered the JaJa, she said she can make a better one at home. I guess that says it all. 

We also ordered an Osmanthus cake to share. It's probably one of the worst things I have tasted. First of all, you can't taste or smell the Osmanthus which is a shame. Second, the \"cake\" tasted bad, really bad. It looks creamy and a little sticky, but when you put it in your mouth it breaks and crumbles. Not to mention there was no taste to it. 

I will probably come back to try their Hong Kong Style Milk Tea, but I will definitely skip the desserts. This place is fun for those that wants to hang out for a bit and enjoy the decor, but the food just isn't up to par."}
{"text":"We came here thinking it was some sort of HK style cafe because they were advertising their award winning HK style milk tea. We went in and boy was this place tiny and odd. All the tables were different and it seemed like you had entered someone's house more than to a store. There were kids doing homework at the back and the owner's friend kept coming in and out of the store. It seemed like a family owned business and everything was made in a home kitchen. Anyhow, we quickly found out after given the menu that this was a place for snacks and to hang out. We ordered the fake shark fin soup, HK style milk tea, tea eggs and sticky rice. Let me just say the portions are super tiny and something you would serve if you had guests over. The portions were tiny but the price was definitely not cheap. Sticky rice and shark fin soup came in a tiny bowl (approx. $5 each), tea egg was 1 tea egg chopped in half which was $2, and HK milk tea in a small cup ($4) and the bill came to $20+. Honestly, that wasn't even worth $10, and it would've cost half that if you were to buy it at TNT or something. I understand it was probably hard to make given such a small atmosphere but it was definitely not worth the hefty price tag at all for the amount of food you get. If you're looking for a place to hang out, I'd suggest you're better off going to a bubble tea store and even there, the food you get would be much better for the price you pay. The atmosphere would also be less awkward. I mean you could literally hear everything the owners were saying and they could hear you because they were literally 3 meters away. To say the least, awkward environment and expensive food. Will not return."}
{"text":"New Chinese dessert house on the block. I had high expectations before coming in because I love Chinese desserts and I love to explore new good eats in the area!

First thing that went wrong: I HEAR THE MICROWAVE *gasp* It was rather quiet in the restaurant, so I can clearly hear the microwave going on and off in the background lol. But wow, food still came out lukewarm... use microwave properly, god dammit!

Even the table next to us expressed the same dissatisfaction. It was rather funny to watch because the 1) House special fried sticky rice ($4) came in a bowl SO dinky, the man at table next to us laughed at it and said \"I'm so surprised lor...\" and then sent it right back. We almost burst laughing... but we didn't sent ours back.

2) Hong Kong styled glass noodle with chicken soup ($4) - bigger bowl, salty, lukewarm, not what I have expected compared to the street-styled ones in Hong Kong.

3) Mango shrimp roll ($4) - 3 pieces. Only thing that was served hot, but mango was sour... actually, what did I just eat? Would be nice if you have a mango sauce to go with it.

4) Cashew dessert soup ($4) - bigger bowl, made with powder (heard them whipping it up), microwaved and served barely warm. I was so excited to see cashew on the menu because you rarely see it anywhere in Chinese dessert houses. But THIS, I can make this at home with powder. Why am I paying $4? As expected, it was tasteless and gloppy. I was expecting it to be steaming hot made with freshly grounded cashew and a taste that will linger in my mouth, leaving me wanting more. Nope, did not get that feeling.

This place deserves a 1-star, but I give them balls to even serve that fried sticky rice in that dinky @ss bowl and charge me $4 for it (+1 star)... it was literally 2 bites. I dare you all to order it. 

One time thing."}
{"text":"Heard from a friend of a friend this place has good desserts but also served \"anything\" you can think of, so gave it a try. 

Anyways we came for dinner but first thing we were told is if we are coming for dinner that they don't have much as they are really a dessert place and only a couple of options available (we came at around 7:00).  The decor and the owner seemed quite interesting and passionate so we still decided to try the couple of options available.

Of the limited option we went with what the owner suggested

1) Pork ribs with rice
Very small portion and felt like home style cooking. Comfort food but nothing to wow about.

2) Papaya and fish soup?
Seemed pretty fresh and no fishy taste. Decent soup but nothing to really wow about but didn't expect that here.

3) Braised Brisket noodle
Portion was again small but this was by far the best dish in terms of taste. The soup was very savory and was told it takes a couple of days to prepare. Solid beefy taste with garlic.

Dessert

There was a lot of dessert to pick from. We had a pancake with yam ice cream which was meh (and of course small). The lychee tea pudding was interesting but again nothing really special.

We found the dessert soups to be the better of the choices. They were enriched with flavour and pretty smooth and thick. We had the hazlenut and the pistachio. Both were pretty good in terms of taste.

Overall I think the owner uses decent quality ingredients in most dishes and doesn't have MSG. Not sure about their cooking style but the food was 
\"ok\". It should probably be a 2 rating but others in our party said dessert was really good, so i'll re-review if and when I come here again. (Would like to try their milk tea though.) 

Also the tea that they give you seems pretty good quality except the shot glass like cups made drinking the tea a lot of work. I would definitely try more tea related things at this place the next time I come since it seems like one of their specialties. 

P.S. As another reviewer mentioned we also did hear the microwave used quite often."}
{"text":"Located at Midland and Finch, we stumbled upon this place thinking it was a HK cafe (like Phoenix). Turns out it was more of a snacks and dessert place. Decor was super authentic, felt like we were back in HK. 

Ordered the milk tea and street style noodle:
Milk tea (5/5): A bit sweet but very good. 
Noodle soup (3/5): got the satay sauce with fish balls and wonton soup. Super basic but had a unique flavor to it. Satay sauce was spicier than average so proceed with caution. 

Will come back to try rice rolls and dessert next time!"}
{"text":"Aberdeen Delicatessen? Delicatessen is a term meaning \"delicacies\" or \"fine foods\".

Here at Aberdeen \"Deli\" one might find some \"Healthy\" and delicious Chinese dessert. Why am I drinking soup as dessert?

Fresh Chestnut Soup ($4.00)
- Chestnuts, unlike other nuts and seeds, are relatively low in calories; contain less fat but are rich in minerals, vitamins and phyto-nutrient, also a good source of dietary fibre
- I always love chestnuts so I am bias. The \"soup\" is so smooth just like a mousse/pudding

Black Glutinous and Coconut Soup ($4.00)
- Black Rice contains great levels of the antioxidant anthocyanin and rich in iron and fibre
- The rice still have good bite but I found the \"soup\" just too watery 

Portion is huge here. But who should be complaining if you are eating healthy food. The dessert definitely not too sweet.. so you might be disappointed if you have a sweet teeth.. but sweet is NOT good for you?!

Aberdeen has a really casual and family vibe. Tables and Chairs are just put together mix and match. Some cheesy decoration might remind you of Hong Kong itself. We were here while the \"family\" having dinner and then some kids running wild....

Aberdeen menu for dessert is huge: traditional and fusion or something that the owner experimenting that you might not find at other restaurant. We were offered to tried her own Project X experimental Sago Mango Layered Pudding Cake (Mango Supreme Cake)?

Daily Special on the wall if you want to have some home made soup and rice plate. 

Aberdeen Delicatessen is kind of a fun casual place. Come with an Open mind and might be delighted!

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"I am glad to see other mediocre ratings for this small restaurant.  We went to this place on a Thursday night.  What attracted us was the egg wrapped rice as they boast  about the deliciousness of such creation on the store exterior.  The owner said they ran out of it because it was busy and she didn't want to do it anymore as it takes 10 minutes to prepare, okay..... So we ordered the simplest noodle soup on the menu where you pick 3 toppings and noodle type and soup base.  5 minutes after order, the server came and told us, they sold out of the thick rice noodle, ok... we changed to thick vermicelli noodle, another 5 minutes later, he came back and said sorry the vermicelli noodle has only 1 portion left (which we ordered 2), so we changed to thin vermicelli noodle.  another few minutes later, he came back and said they are out of chicken kidney, i asked for chicken hearts, which of course they ran out too, he suggested chicken wings.  When the two bowls finally arrived with not one thing of what we originally ordered, the owner said their curry is very good.  My boyfriend gave me a look and said this taste nothing like curry, he could only taste spiciness and garlic.  The owner was ranting at how the customers at the next table were despising her food and boasting about how she prepares her food with extreme care and pride.  i expressed that the portion for my noodle was very small, two beef balls, 1 fish skin balls and 1 chicken wing, and i wished i was more informed when i ordered.  Then she ranted that the cost of food was expensive, she cannot possibly gave customers a larger portion, okay... and how everything she makes is the best of Toronto if not best in Canada (Wow)

We ordered a milk tea steamed milk as soon as we sat down, which i have no absolutely no issue on the taste and the creativity and will go back for more.  I absolutely admire the owner's confidence and the way she describes her food was already worthwhile to hear and make me really wanted to try everything, it's a real talent."}
{"text":"A while back, I decided to not write reviews for places that were unpleasant, as it may come across as being overly critical and small business owner deserves a fair chance for survival. Aberdeen Delicatessen had reignited my desire to publish reviews about local businesses that are simply sub-par. It is important for fellow Yelpers to learn from my experience at Aberdeen Delicatessen. 

While the business owner claims she only uses the highest quality ingredients, the food was awful. It was a deeply disappointing experience as I was looking forward to Chinese dessert soup (tong sui). My friend and I shared the Hasma Almond Soup ($5.50) and fried Black Sesame cake ($4.00). The flavour of the prior dessert is dominated by rice rather than Hasma or Almond. It was by far, one of the worst Chinese desserts I have ever had; worst than free desserts from restaurants. Surprisingly, the nearby Fantasy Eatery's dessert soup is far superior and has stronger South Almond and North Almond flavours. Both establishments claimed the almond is grinded raw, but one is clearly a cut above the other. The flavour of the latter was null. While I wanted appreciate that it is low in sugar, it lacked the robust sesame flavour I come to expect from these types of desserts. My friend and I both agreed that both dishes were not palatable. 

I can tolerate poor desserts, but I find it difficult to stomach the owner's attitude. 
The lack of respect for patrons is more unpleasant than the food quality. I had respectfully asked for a metal fork, as my goal this year is to reduce the consumption of plastic. The owner suggested that it is not environmentally friendly to take the bus and also to drive. As well, the food they serve here is extremely not environmentally conscious due to the high level of waste and amount of electricity it requires. I still feel there is nothing wrong with wanting to contribute a little to mother earth by making small changes in daily actions. This was my small acts to celebrate earth. However, the owner kept interjecting with statements about actions that are not environmentally sound. She then suggested that my Chinese is poor and she has a MBA from SFU, which was irrelevant in the conversation. The whole conversation becomes nonsensical to the extent of which I no longer want to respond. In the most immature way, the owner decided to make gestures behind me. It is possible to have different opinions while respecting each other, but this individual failed to recognize diversity and fail to respect silence. 

The food deserves one star. The attitude of the owner is worthy of negative stars. If Yelp allows it, Aberdeen Delicatessen (still uncertain about the name Delicatessen as nothing is fine about the food being served here), earned itself zero stars."}
