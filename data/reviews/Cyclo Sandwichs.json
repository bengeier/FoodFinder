{"text":"We go to lots of Vietnamese restaurants so our standards are quite high. This place is quite adorable in ambiance, our sandwiches were crafted with great care and fresh ingredients and the owner herself is very sweet. We also had the noodles and they were delicious. Really wish we lived a bit closer as this place is quite authentic and we will be returning"}
{"text":"L'endroit n'est pas invitant et si vous cherchez une place oü amener votre date, n'y allez pas, mais si vous êtes adeptes de soupes Miso, de rouleaux printanniers et de sandwichs vietnamiens, c'est le meilleur restau du coin! Je vous suggère le rouleau printannier et le bol de vermicelle ! Excellent! 

Vraiment un incontournable pour vos midis pressés entre deux meetings ! Le plus? ils offrent des paparmanes roses au cas où! ahah"}
{"text":"Went back there today to pickup yummy sandwiches and they are still delicious! They also gave me a loyalty card, buy ten get one free! So I'm slightly sad that I missed on my previous sandwiches' stamps but c'est la vie. At least I took photos today."}
{"text":"This place is another bleh place for me. We were curious and were quite disappointed. The sandwich wasn't bad but it was far from good. Felt more like I just eating bread. Very stingy on meats and veggies. The baguette was extremely similar then the one you would buy at Kim Phat for 0,50$/each. The pickled carrots/daikon and cucumber weren't that crunchy. Lack on freshness?? 11,50$ for two sandwiches is REALLY not worth it. Maybe they thought that being the only one in that area is a win-win but in my opinions, this place is not worth the detour."}
