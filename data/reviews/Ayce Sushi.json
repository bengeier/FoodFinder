{"text":"The seaweed salad was good, but the tempura was not. My friend had the Thai green curry and said that it tasted like someone had dumped salt in in and there was no spice to it. I had the Cantonese chow mein and the noodles tasted like old deep fryer oil. Both of us felt sick after. The food wasn't at all worth what we paid."}
{"text":"Cute staff but the food is mediocre. But for Sq One I guess the owner is doing the smart thing by not offering too much on the plate. The customers will be there anyway because of the convenient location. Disappointing. If you like raw fish I would advise you to go somewhere else. Not a lot offered here."}
{"text":"Wow where to begin....?

We were greeted and seated quickly. The plates that were set on our table was dirty. We asked the waiter for clean dishes and forks. He looked at us as if it was an inconvenience for him to get us clean plates and utensils. 


The sushi took forever to arrive and it was not fresh at. The tempura shrimp i a couple of the rolls tasted like they were cooked from earlier in the morning (we had a late lunch ~2pm.

We asked for tea several times and the waiter kept forgetting! Also, we overheard the manager scolding an employee in the background which was unprofessional. 

This was one of the worst ayce experiences we've ever had...no wonder its usually empty in there.  Honestly spend your money somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This place does not deserve a level of 1 star. As soon I got into this restaurant with friends, the service do not introduce us or greet with us before being seated. While we got sat down and started  to order our first sushi list for dinner we went through fine. But during the time of our food came out really slow between 15-20min to make each sushi on the list. There was only one service taking care of the rest of whole room & the owner of the restaurant did not bother help out but to tell the service do all the work. The sushi looks over packed with rice & tiny thin layer of raw fish. It looks like a 5 year old who made the sushi & the plate was really warm so made the sushi warm. At the end of the night when were paying our service have bad communication with one my friend. End up not give the correct change before we leave. So far the worst sushi restaurant in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Why come here: You are in the area, want unpretentious Japanese food combined with a bit of Thai, sick of Spring Rolls and you really really like rice. Also, if you want to do that convo with a friend:

Friend: where did you go?
You: AYCE sushi\"
Friend: OH, where?
You: I told ya, AYCE sushi
and so on......

Why you shouldn't come here:  You want to get super value for your money (ie you're super super super cheap) and eat 50 pcs of raw fish (without the rice), want eel and you want to see Gordon Ramsey type dishes.  

Atmosphere:  3/5.  It's not bad, considering it's in a mall and there is a bit of isolation, but I couldn't help but stare at the fact that I was right across from a Lenscrafters.  This used to be Lemongrass location and they didn't really change much.  

Service: 3.5/5 - the host was very friendly, explained the ordering process and that they were environmentally friendly as they tried to use the same piece of paper for each re-order (maybe they are just being cheap lol). They didn't miss a single thing, which is rare for ayce joints.
----------------------------
Food: Okay, I'm going to preface this in that I was really hungry and just came off an intense 2.5 hour workout.  What is nice about this place is that all the rolls are 3-4 pcs at the most, meaning you can try most of it. I'm going to break the food review into 4 sections and they combine to make 3/5.

     Apps: Miso soup, potato croquettes, grilled mackerel.  Soup was too salty, mackerel was too rubbery and over-cooked, but the croquettes were perfectly fried and crispy.   2.5/5

   Sushi/maki: Spicy salmon maki, salmon skin maki, green dragon maki, spicy salmon sushi, fish roe sushi, white tuna sushi, and red snapper sushi.  I loved the salmon skin maki and the fish roe sushi.  Salmon skin didn't have a weird taste to it, which is rare and the fish roe was nice and tasty.  I only wish the fish roe and spicy salmon sushi were wrapped better. The presentation is lacking at this place.  3/5

Entrees (using this term loosely): Grilled salmon belly, BBQ eel hand roll, pad thai.  Salmon belly was very fresh and tasty, although slightly charred.  Pad thai was really good and was more Thai street style than fusion style (i.e. tomato sauce a la Spring Rolls).  While those two were great, the BBQ eel hand roll was lacking. Too much rice and only 1 or 1.5 pieces of eel. Disappointing. 3/5

Dessert: They have a wide selection, but I stuck to the basics - red bean and green tea ice cream. It was good. 3.5/5
 
Overall for food:: 3/5

Would I come back? Probably just to meet up with friends or something, but not something I am totally wowed by."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The waiters refused to smile. They were very cheap with the ordering form. Kept reusing the tiny piece of paper 3 times. The sushi was not good either, it was packed with rice. The sashimi was ok but with very small slices. Only the manager is courteous and takes care of the place. The rest of the place is not worth it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I cannot love this place anymore.
It was one of my favourite all you can eat sushi spots in Mississauga and I've probably been here 5 times, but my last visit yesterday (Sunday) was nothing but a disappointment.
I don't know if they got a new sushi chef, but the food has really taken a nosedive.
The only way the pieces of fish could get any thinner is if you used laser technology to cut them.
Also the rice was disgusting. Inedible.
I've made better sushi at home (...and that was one time... and it was disgusting and I threw it out).
It pained me to pay for something that bad.
The service was also terrible.
We were there for an hour and 40 minutes and only got two orders of food.
I had to stand up and hand our order to the waiter (possibly the owner? I've seen him around a lot).
Every roll was overstuffed with rice.
I went home and ate a giant roast beef dinner.
Who does that after ayce?!?

Too bad Prince Sushi isn't open for lunch on Sundays."}
{"text":"You'd think that a place with waiters that refuse to smile should have some pretty great food. Nope. All of the rolls were packed with way too much rice and a sliver of fish. There were few specialty rolls that were interesting and quite a few standard ones were missing too. The cooked food was decent enough at least. The one bright spot was the sashimi. They were fresh and buttery soft. Everything else seemed to be done half heartedly though.

The good thing about this place is they don't seem to miss any order. Also, the food comes out fast."}
{"text":"After coming here again, I was very disappointed to say the least. The name of the place is still awesome but the quality of the food isn't. I was expecting lots of rice on the rolls because that seems to be their thing but the rolls today were just pathetic. I know that seems harsh but the rice was soggy for our second order and the slices of fish were thinner than the menu. 

The service. . . Oh god the service lol. It was super slow and poor girl who was our waitress. She was really nice but you could tell that she was stressing because the manager was yelling instructions at her as if she was incompetent.   

I really wanted to like this place because my first experience was awesome and my gf loved this place (before today) but the evidence speaks for itself. 

Saving grace: dessert is still awesome (although the tiramisu cakes were dry this time) and you get your own teapot at the table."}
