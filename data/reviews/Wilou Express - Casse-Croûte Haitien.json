{"text":"Best place in Laval to get Haitian food!!!!   Everything is freshly made and very tasty. The portions are very big and the price is very low so good bang for your buck.  You need to go early and like that you know for sure they will have everything you want. You have a small counter where you can eat but it gets really busy so you wont be able to eat there so be ready to take your platter home and eat it in peace so you can really enjoy it.  They have chicken, turkey, griot, fish, legim and a few more dish to choose from with also riz colle or riz blanc. Everything is very good so you will not be disappointed regardless what you choose.  This is a family own and run business and the service is #1. The owner is always welcoming you with a huge smile and a hello and its the same with his lovely wife. Always thanking you for coking by. Makes you want to go back again and again because they are so inviting.  MUST TRY!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bon service rapide et chaleureux , jai pris un plat griot c'était tres bon je vais essayer un plat du jour la prochaine fois. Take out only. À essayer si vous êtes dans le coin !"}
{"text":"AMAZING prices 6$ for a whole meal. The griot is delicious and based on a family recipie.  Family owned and operated you are treated like one of their own.  You are served with a smile and they appreciate your business unlike other restaurants of this nature.  The only downside is that it is not as flavorful as the bigger haïtien restaurants in Montreal however for a local place for lavalians it's the best I've found!"}
{"text":"Very basic but 1) very friendly service, 2) huge portions, 3) cheap. No tables but there is a counter. Had the griot, with riz collé, plantain, and salad for 8.99$. Small menu but interesting and affordable."}
{"text":"Wilou Express is a family owned takeout counter that specializes only in Creole cuisine. When I walked in for a quick lunch I realized a few things.   Firstly it was very busy with a 10 minutes lineup to order... which can be a good thing. Secondly there's no seating so your order, grab the food and go!  I went with the Griot and fried rice. The food was good but it's not the best I've eaten. I personally prefer Chez Nadine. The food was more dry than I'm comfortable with.  Other than that, the price is great and the service I got was very friendly and awesome. I'd come back to try them out again. Bonus points for being a family business.  Oh, take the Fruit Champagne as a drink.... it's pure heaven."}
