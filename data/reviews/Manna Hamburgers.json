{"text":"Fries here are amazing and they have a lot of tasty menu items for low prices. Great burger place comparable to biggie burger on mulock. They've always got 2 or 3 arcade games as well usually an old street fighter or metal slug title."}
{"text":"Overlook the lime  green paint, pink accents, mirrored walls, chairs attached to tables a la food court style and enjoy some carefully prepared foods at bargain basement prices.   An establishment that obviously caters to the students at nearby Huron Heights (they have their own menu) the menu board includes everything from hot chocolate, to souvlaki,  an  8 ounce homemade hamburger for just over $4, and that fave Korean staple Bulgogi.  I had a delectable Gyros  The big K was happy with his pork souvlaki with accompanying Greek salad.  We can't wait to go back for noodles.  Order at the counter. Service is friendly.  Lottery gaming and computer terminals line two walls.  There's seating for 35 but most people order take-out.  Our dinner for two = just under $15."}
{"text":"Manna Hamburgers is a small mom and pop shop that attempts to do it all. They serve homeburgers, gyros, souvlaki and even ramen (plus more stuff). They even have a vertical gyro rotisserie! This review mainly speaks to what I ordered, a homeburger.

Service: 3/5 - i ordered a homeburger and it took about 10 minutes to make (which the lady working there told me in advance). This is probably because turnover is pretty slow as I was there for about 15-20 minutes during peak lunch hour and I was the only customer there.

Food: 4/5 - i ordered a homeburger which was surprisingly good. It kind of tasted like Lick's Homeburger (probably the best burgers I've had). It was grilled right after I order and was not dry (nor juicy).

Price: 4/5 - the 8oz burger ended up being $5.55 after taxes. Compared to McDonalds or Harveys, you are getting a lot more for your money. Compared to other burger places, Manna is definitely cheaper. They also serve frozen burgers that are cheaper than the homeburger, see pics for menu.

Overall Manna Hamburgers is a decent restaurant if you are looking for a homey feel and taste. Don't go in with any expectations and surprise yourself"}
{"text":"Great little place, that seems overlooked by a lot of people.  Very affordable prices and solid food.  Burgers and fries are good, but the gyros are just too good for me to order a burger very often.  They also have a decent assortment of candy and quite a lot of drinks like a convenience store."}
