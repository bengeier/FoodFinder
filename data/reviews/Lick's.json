{"text":"We decided to try the new Licks here in Pickering since we hadn't eaten at a Licks in several years.  We hadn't been missing anything.  First, the prices were way too high.  For the two of us to have a Homeburger, fried, and a drink was $28!  Just a drink was $2.99 which is sit-down restaurant pricing, not fast food pricing.   For the same price we could have eaten at Five Guys or South Street Burgers and enjoyed it a lot more.  Frankly, I dislike the Licks seasoning they put in their burgers so they would never get more than 3 stars from me, but given the pricing and the lame toppings I would give them  1 and a half but since they don't have half stars I gave them 2.  They charge $1 to add cheese and that is just a tiny handful of lame grated cheddar and jack mix that isn't even melted!  The choice of toppings was lacking and the tomatoes were not ripe.  I doubt I will ever go back, other places just have a far better product for the same or lower prices."}
{"text":"Good riddance to bad burgers.  On August 31, a new purple banner with the name \"Kopper Kitchen\" covered the Lick's signs, and they posted a new diner type menu on the door.   Time for the rest of the chain to go away.  Pickering needs Five Guys, Fatburger, Smashburger, or Shake Shack (a man can dream...) rather than this joke."}
{"text":"I love licks normally, however I have been here 3 times and each time it's something different... Lack of staff, undercooked turkey burger and screwing up order.  It's very disappointing since it is so close to me. The drive to morningside is worth it to avoid any disasters"}
{"text":"Lick's finds itself in a interesting spot.  I don't think it competes with the quality of other high end gourmet burger places but it does try to make up the gap through being less expensive.  It is still twice the cost of a fast food place but is worth it given how rarely we seek fast food.  Their veggi-burger is the best out this way."}
