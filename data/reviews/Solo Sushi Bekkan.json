{"text":"Ate here last on December 11th, 2012 with a group of girlfriends.  Prior to that, I've been there a couple of times.  This place is a gem in the City which offers delicious and authentic Japanese cuisine.  The Japanese owner, Jyo, was there that night & took really good care of us.  He even offered us wine compliments of him! We had lots of food that evening, but the most memorable dish was the grill mackerel.  It was so good that we had to order it again!  We wanted to order fresh uni (sea urchin), unfortunately it is only available on Weds - when they receive their weekly shipment.  Oden (Japanese stew) was even available that evening & it was so delicious.  After eating it, my body just warmed up.

The restaurant seats only about 20 people, so sometimes people may have to wait a while before getting a table.

As for parking, there are lots of metered street parking on Grosvenor St & Grenville St.

Also, for those who enjoy original artworks, the restaurant is decorated with many paintings - all done by Jyo's talented teenage daughter.  Jyo mentioned that she has received many art awards, including national ones too!"}
{"text":"I went there with two other friends. I am a sashimi lover. The sweet shrimp and uni made me wanna vomit. Not fresh at all. Probably the worst I have ever eaten. I went home and had stomach, won't go there again."}
{"text":"Had both good and really poor service here. Years ago when I went there it was run by what seem to be one sushi chef.  I revisited there a few months ago and the food was still delicious, the o'toro was fresh but poorly cut but reasonably priced. Service on the other hand was horrid, because of their small tables it doesn't fit many things. I had to ask the waiter to take empty plates away. The restaurant wasn't even busy, it was just my table and two waiters. What also frustrated us was one of the waiters told us there's no uni, and that there's none in all of Toronto. Errr ya right!"}
{"text":"Came on a a Friday night and ordered the King sushi plate, agedashi tofu, tempura and udon soup. 

The quality of the sushi was very disappointing.  The rice was poorly made and the fish looked a bit sad. Definitely not worth taking photos of. They just lacked the colour and freshness you'd expect from a sushi restaurant.  

The saving grace was the udon and the other dishes were quite good but nothing out of the ordinary for this type of food.  Standard Japanese fare that no restaurant should mess up. 

So come for the kitchen food and leave the sushi.  Not impressed for the price."}
{"text":"The best sushi in this price range in Toronto.  The ingredients are always very high quality: the fish is fresh, they make their own soy sauce and wasabi, the rice is perfect every time, the salad uses real lettuce, not iceberg, etc.  What I love is that the prices are no higher than any of the dozens of crap restaurants littering Yonge Street in this area.  I'm always torn between the sushi and the equally good kitchen menu - the negima yaki is so good we had to order a second batch the first time we had it.  I won't recommend anything specifically because I've never had anything that I wasn't happy with, and I've tried quite a bit of their menu.  If bluefin tuna is available, go ahead and upgrade your sushi, it's worth the money, it melts in your mouth as you eat it.  It's hard to find a truly perfect sushi, and this is it.  I will say that the coffee pudding dessert they often offer is more suited to a Japanese taste than a North American one, although my wife likes it.  

The service is very friendly and fast.  The washroom is ground level if anyone's disabled, (but there is a step up into the restaurant, I believe, for wheelchair users.)  The restaurant would be packed at 20 people, so it's not well suited for large groups.  They have a large beer and saki menu, and I really enjoyed the Asahi Black beer."}
{"text":"I came here recently because I saw lots of good reviews. Although most of the food was decent, I can't give the place a good review. I tried some sashimi and nigiri. The cuts were done well enough, but the choice in fish were very poor. Bland yellow tail, lifeless tuna and salmon, and very dry tamago. I did not enjoy the first dish much at all. Added to this, the wasabi they mix is very watery and did not suit my preference. Bigger problems arose once my uni and hotate nigiri came. The uni was one of the worst I've had and was unfortunate since it was one of the recommended items. I would have hoped no one with decent reputation would serve uni that was so far gone, yet it was difficult to eat even though I am a huge lover of sea urchin. The hotate was also quite disappointing as it had none of the sweetness and smooth texture that should come with a good piece of scallop. All in all, the regular options were average at best and the less ordered choices are definite things to avoid.

I was really excited to find a well reviewed sushi near my new location, but I definitely will not be returning. Luckily, there are some other good options in the area and even within a 15 minute walk there are no shortages of choices."}
{"text":"Their rolls were good (but their other stuff is better).  I made the mistake of going on a \"feeling cheap day\" and ordered mostly rolls the first time I was there.

I was sitting in the bar, so I was taunted the entire time by the sashimi orders that were coming out.  Ended up dropping more money on some fresh Amebi and hamachi - was fantastic.  Their wasabi is the freshest I've found in Toronto.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for many years, and even though their sushi is average, the staff have always been friendly, and the location is perfect for me as I work very close by.

Today I went to order some sashimi for pick up and said I was just going to go to the store next door to get something and would be back in 10 minutes, and they demanded that I paid ahead of time. They would not take my order unless I paid first. For all the years I have ordered pick up i have never been asked to pay in advance. Something must have change, maybe new ownership or new management. 

I am happy there are many other options for sushi around because I will not (sadly) go back there."}
{"text":"First visit for dinner, the place is tiny and was almost full on a Friday night. Was not handed a menu, but that could be because we were already looking at the take-out menu (we were dining in). Service was generally slow, but that could be forgiven since they were very busy. 

Food wise, it was great! We ordered the sushi king set, of which the tuna nigiri was fantastic. The fish just melts in your mouth. The spicy salmon roll was delicious as well. The price is more than your average sushi shop, but makes up for it in terms of quality."}
{"text":"I should start by saying that I am still mourning the unceremonious closing of my favourite ever in the world sushi restaurant (Oishi Kada in Kensington) and nothing will ever replace it.   

However, I cannot understand why people seem to think that maki that are not perfect little uniform circles = bad sushi. Here are my basic rules for maki: 

-does it hold together when picked up by chopsticks?
-does it fit in my mouth?
-(most important) does it taste good?

If YES to all 3, we are on our way to yummy sushi! I couldn't give a darn if it's not the prettiest. Solo Sushi Bekkan meets all three criteria, and while it may not be super tightly rolled, I would trade that for super-fresh, good rice-to-fish proportioned, tasty maki any day. 

I gave them a try with the lunch special--chef's choice of 6 maki, 4 sushi, soup and salad for $8. Not a bad deal! 

The spicy rolls had a flavourful spicy sauce, and the fish was melt-in-your mouth fresh. They make an effort on the salad dressing and miso soup too--I always appreciate when a sushi place doesn't treat these as afterthoughts. 

As for the cash-only thing: I placed my order, then ran around looking for a bank having read their cash-only sign. However, as I had ordered a late lunch and they were not too busy at the time, the server kindly pointed out to me that next time I could pay with a card--it's only cash when they're slammed for the lunch/dinner rush, so just check in about this when you order."}
{"text":"Due to my recent desire to become Japanese (well, sort of) ... I went on another food craze to search out for the best in this cuisine but within a given price range (i.e. one that will allow me to come back often without breaking the bank BUT still makes me eat like royalty). Some research online brought me to Solo on Tuesday (apparently Mr. Chef is there on Tuesday and possibly Wednesday or Monday). To keep this review short and sweet, this restaurant got a permanent set on my Flickr Photostream. In other words, I am going back often so be prepared for more pictures! 

The d√©cor isn't posh but the food is excellent. The only complain I had was the rice ... a little bit tasteless but maybe that is intentional to bring out the flavors of the dishes. The miso soup was earthy and the salad was superb (not too tangy and the grated radish gave it the extra oomph). The fish was fresh and I could not stop sucking on the shrimp's head ... it was soooo sweet! The bento box was delicious as well where the sauce was just perfect (I kept trying to pick at the remains - yes, it was that good) and the maki was delicate yet crunchy due to the tempura bits. The tempura was done just right - not too greasy and yet crisp. The BC sea urchin was recommended by the chef (who came out to serve us himself) and it was ... well ... an acquired taste. My guest did not like it but I was letting it melt in my mouth slowly. The service was excellent as well where we were continuously tended to. The dishes and placemat setting were spotless and done in style! LOVE it. 

BTW, the wasabi and soya sauce seemed home-made and I quite enjoyed them. It is different but it really pulls the dishes together. It is this sort of obsessive attention to detail that makes a restaurant stand out IMHO. Hell, even I use special Sashimi sauce at home ..."}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise, the soft shell crab was excellent.  Don't be scared away by the decor or the lack of midweek patrons, we were only one of three tables but the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Very tiny shop, sometimes you feel like you'll be sitting in your neighbours lap, but the quality is decent and the service is okay. 

I know that others have had issues with the location in the past but I've gone several times and haven't had an issue. 

I tend to get the omasake lunch special which is always the same and tastes good. The sushi is quality and fresh tasting. Great little lunch spot downtown."}
{"text":"Summary: I wonder where the photos come from, the rating and the price don't reflect the quality, I will never recommend anyone to go there for sushi. 


We like sushi and have tried quite a few in Toronto. That night we wanted to celebrate a job contract so we decided to take out some sushi. Usually we  go to WoW sushi but we wanted to try something new so we searched on yelp to find a good place. We founded this place: 4 stars with ~60 reviews, it looked like it was good. Now if you look more in details you will notice that a lot of reviews are old and the restaurant website is mentioning 2008 articles, what happened the last 5 years?

We ordered a platter over the phone for 100$ around 6pm on a Tuesday and went for pick up 30 minutes after. The platter was around 50 pieces so I was really expecting something good.

The order was ready when we arrived which is good but not the most important when you care about food quality you can wait if necessary.

Here is what we got:
1) The Wasabi was completely liquid.
2) The rice was over cooked.
3) The roll were not well made in term of shape and consistency.
4) The Nigiri sushi were a joke: the cook doesn't know how to cut fish properly. The fish was cut in huge piece with a bad shape and some part of it should have been removed. The sushi were breaking into pieces when you take them.
5) The roll contained a lot of spicy mayo, enough to hide the taste of other ingredients.
5) The variety in the platter was poor: 
 - Nigiri (5p each): shrimp, salmon, yellow tail, tuna and 3 eels (oversized with bones in it...)
- 3 types of rolls with a lot of spicy mayonnaise in it. (6p each)
6) The bottom of the platter was sort of greasy.

This place is not cheap and the quality is poor, I guess some people likes rice with spicy mayo more than fish."}
{"text":"As a devoute sushi lover, I wasn't impressed with this restaurant. I went for a casual lunch with some friends and they must have been having an off day because my experience with their sashimi wasn't as delicious as everyone else's. 

The service was good, the waitress was polite and kind, the tea was perfect and the setting was quaint. The perfect start to a \"hidden gem\"! My friends ordered maki while I ordered chirashi (my favorite). Everything was reasonably priced (the chirashi was $17 and the maki ranged from $4.50-$12) but the chirashi didn't thrill me. It came with 2 slices of salmon, 3 slices of bluefin tuna and 3 slices of mackerel. Personally, I'm not a fan of either mackerel or bluefin tuna (mackerel is just to \"fishy\" for me and this bluefin tuna was .... blah) so I asked for something else. I was a bit upset to see that mackerel was one of their top selection, but I was willing to pay the extra money ($5) to get a different assortment. It came back with a beautiful serving of hamachi (yellowfin) and whitefish with a prawn on top. Yum! Definitely what I was hoping for in the first place. While the spread was nice, the sashimi itself was fairly... blah. Not buttery soft salmon, no melt in your mouth hamachi. It was alright, but I don't think I'd order it again. 

All in all, we had a good time at this restaurant. Yes, the chirashi wasn't the greatest and yes, they had the watteriest wasabi EVER, but their maki was lovely and I'd like to think they were just not at their peak today. Oh well, I might try them again to see."}
{"text":"Sashimi is fresh, has interesting special dishes like salmon collar which is very tasty! Some times the rice can be a little too vinegary for my liking. My husband likes the bento boxes here. The lunch special for ~$10 is a good deal for quality sushi that is a few notches above a regular sushi joint."}
{"text":"If I could give zero, I would. I used to be a frequent customer to solo. However this incident happened one month made me decide that I will never visit this place again. I have always ordered the same meal at solo. That sushi plater has a combination of fish however I only like salmon. I always requested that the other kinds of fish by replaced by salmon. And the waiter and sushi chef have had always allowed me to make this change. But the other day a lady who claimed she is the owner of solo denied my request and acted rudely. She insisted that she would only serve me the meal as it is per menu and refused to serve me free salad and soup if I am to make these changes. Moreover, she loudly announced in the store that since she is the owner of the restaurant she gets to dictate who will get free soup and salad. And she specifically pointed at me and said you are not going to get free soup and salad. She even intimidated me by asking for my name and making it sound like she is never going to serve me again. Funny enough to that it turns out that she only wanted another extra dollar for what I wanted. This was the worst experience I have ever had. I highly urge whoever plans to go to solo to go somewhere else unless you want a horrible horrible dining experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"space is small, if you are big or fat, this place is not for you. open hours are too short. sushi is excellent."}
{"text":"I went to Sushi Bekkan for some sushi with my boyfriend before going to the movies.  The sushi was just delicious.  I tell all my friends that love Sushi to visit this place because the prices are good and the sushi is good."}
{"text":"Good is decent, but the miniscule selection on the menu that's filled with what looks like essays and the horribly rude waitress I encountered last time ruin it."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi place in town. Tiny place, probably seats around 20 people. Great service, GREAT SUSHI!!! They also have chef's specials, like seared tuna and pork belly. My favourite part is their home made wasabi, its spicy and has a distinct taste to it at the same time. Will go back!"}
{"text":"The sushi is really fresh and tasty but where they fell short was on the high prices and the no credit card thing. If I'm going to pay a lot, I expect to be able to charge it."}
{"text":"so after working out at the Y across the street we decided to check this place out and I have to say, left a little disappointed. 

the good: amazingly fresh fish and very cute, cozy interior. I got the sushi king set and it came with a toro one which melted in your mouth. my boyfriend got the grilled mackerel and it tasted like they caught it like 20 minutes before. 

the bad: despite the great quality fish, the sushi was less than presentable -- sort of just slapped together. this wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for the fact that the rice was totally warm, overcooked/mushy and tasted overly sour and sweet. they also put way too much rice in both the nigiri and the rolls -- it was seriously like carbfest 3000. you really shouldn't be drowning good quality fish with all this mushy sushi rice. 

I pointed out the mushy rice to the waitress who dismissively said that it was because the rice was newly made, which I found problematic because you aren't supposed to serve just-made rice in sushi -- it needs to cool down and harden first. it probably also absorbed too much vinegar and sugar because it was newly made. 

the salad was also pretty lackluster -- leaves were wilting and too much dressing. miso was good though. 

anyway we will probably give this place one more try because it seems to have potential."}
{"text":"What a gem! The food was fresh and had such an authentic flavour to it.  Each piece of sushi had subtle little details and flavours that most sushi restaurants just don't put into their food.  But the price is slightly higher and portions slightly smaller than the average not-so-authentic Japanese restaurant, so it's not something I would splurge for everyday, even though I found Solo Sushi Bekkan really really yummy.  It helps that they have a daily lunch special for $8.95, to offset the cost.  But if you're hungry or a big eater, the special might not be enough food for you.

The restaurant is also tiny.  If going for lunch, try to make it there for slightly before noon, to guarantee a seat."}
{"text":"I am waffling between 3-4 stars but ultimately I am going to give it a 3 because there were two major things wrong with this restaurant.

THE GOOD THINGS:
This sushi is incredibly fresh. It's some of the freshest I've had in Toronto (sorry, Japan and/or Hong Kong still wins for having the best sushi), and the fish just melted in your mouth.

They are AUTHENTIC Japanese chefs here. None of that fake \"we can do everything because we look Asian\" restaurants that I am sure many of you have come across.

THE BAD THINGS:
Portion. Sizes. Need I say more? They were tiny. 

I removed my waist belt in anticipation of the sushi feast and I didn't even need to remove my belt.

I paid $17 for 10 pieces of sashimi. They were a good honkin' size, but gosh darnit, I needed more for that price! Japango has better portions for the price.

Sure, I got a miso soup and salad which was heavenly with it, but I needed more. At least 15 pieces to have been sufficiently full. And another bowl of rice.

Service/Serving was AWFUL. I know the restaurant gets packed, but the server:

a) Didn't understand basic English (not his fault, probably new to the country and trying to learn the job), but even so.. I was miming and trying to get him to understand that we wanted separate bills, and I wanted nothing to do with fake crab on my plates.

b) Forgot to bring water AND green tea. I mean, OMG. Just look at the table and you can check to see if we have liquids or not. We were thirsty the ENTIRE meal until my friend couldn't take it any longer and had to wave like a maniac to get his attention.

c) Forgot to bring my unagi roll, which we waited 20 minutes (or more) after getting our meal and finishing it. I ended up saying: Eff this unagi roll, and I just paid for my sashimi deluxe.

The chef apologized for missing the unagi roll (probably the newbie waiter's fault), but I was really disappointed in the service.

I think that ruined it for me, even if the sushi was pretty great.

Oh wellz. On to the next. I still like Japango the best."}
{"text":"FINALLY! Sushi in Toronto that can compare to Vancouver sushi! Very good, genuine service with a smile, high quality food, served fresh. Fast service, but not so fast that you wonder if everything was pre-made. Seems authentic. I could see myself becoming a regular here!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good..... 3.5 Stars  

The food gets 4 stars on this visit
Restaurant / atmosphere more like 2-3 stars

The Good:

- Polite and friendly staff
- First time trying sushi Pizza - pretty good here (I know, not very traditional)
- The fish was high quality and all incredibly fresh. On par with some downtown restaurants charging much more
- Broad based menu with Omakase options
- Deluxe Sushi was limited to only 3 choices but incredibly fresh and delicious. A little pricey at $19 for 6 pieces but the quality was well worth it
- They have a menu page for specials - We tried the Tuna Tata (reminds me of Poke from Hawaii) and deep fried Octopus balls - both good

BAD

- \"0\" atmosphere and it's tiny - 5 tables and 3-4 seats at the sushi bar
- Hard to find the restaurant - a hole in the wall
- I smelled like a small sushi restaurant for the rest of the evening - agree with other reviewers

I had a terrible experience at the sister restaurant - Solo Sushi Ya in Newmarket. It was dirty and the Fish was not all that fresh. Given some questionable recent food quality reviews for Bekkan, makes me wonder if these guys have the correct standards in place. In fairness, I was perfectly fine after my visit to Bekkan.

P.S. - Make reservations 

BK"}
{"text":"I hate that I have to give this place two stars.  In fact, it should actually be one star.  However, because of past good dinner experiences, I decided to bump it up to two.  

I ate lunch here for the first time with a group of friends.  About an hour or so later, I became so ill, I can't even express the discomfort I was in.  Without going into too many details, I had excruciating stomach pains.  I ended up at a nearby pub but spent the entire time in their bathroom.  I've never gotten sick from sushi before and of all places, I can't believe I got sick here!  

I'm sorry, I really liked this place a lot.  I just can't go back anymore."}
{"text":"Mouthwatering sushi that melts in your mouth is the perfect way to describe Solo Sushi Bekkan.

Service was great. Our lunch special orders took no time to arrive at our table. For $8.95, you get 6 maki rolls, 4 nigiri sushi, soup and salad.  Some may argue this portion of food isn't enough but I found it to be adequate. Wasabi is delicious, so smooth you would think it was whipped! 

Be forewarned though, the seating is limited and you are in close quarters with other customers. We noticed a lot of take-out orders being picked up while having lunch.

Overall, the quality of the sushi is excellent ~ super fresh!"}
{"text":"Another small independent sushi restaurant, I love the atmosphere and service. I was lucky enough to walk in and get seats with some friends, usually they take reservations.
I had the chirashi don and it was a flavorful experience with so much different textures from the selected fishes, I never got bored with this dish.
I would recommend people to go when the senior sushi chef is working, I don't know how you can find that out but I've been lucky the last few times. My only complaint would be I wish the restaurant would be just a bit bigger."}
{"text":"Like Buttah! That's the only way to describe their sashimi. The dichotomy of firmness and softness was perfect and the flavour was excellent. The server recommended a Canadian scallop sashimi to begin and it was staggeringly good, wedged between slices of lemon. Both my boyfriend and I were impressed! He has a Chicken Bento that included red beans Two pieces of sushi, mixed tempura veggies and rice. He liked everything but the fish was definitely the stand out. 

The cuteness of this place can not be overlooked \"KAWAYEE!\" (cute in Japanese). There are less than 10 tables in Solo Sushi and walls are decorated with the chef's 16 year old daughter's art work. There was even one with giraffes, zebras and other safari animals that she painted when she was quite young \"KAWAYEE!\". 

Our server was very sweet-- brought us lots of water and checked in a few times to make sure we were happy with everything. Solo Sushi is is my new Toronto gold standard for sushi and although it wasn't cheap for dinner, it was reasonable given the quality and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The omakase was wonderful and a good value for $55. I went with 3 other friends, and 2 of us ordered the omakase. Unfortunately, the waiter was very pushy, trying to get the other 2 to order it too, and when it failed, he tried to push other dishes on them, and made things rather uncomfortable. But definitely would go there again."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with this sushi joint. I got the lunch sushi set that came with about 10 pieces of sushi and rolls. The fish did not taste fresh nor was it standard quality compared to similar price point sushi places. The rolls were overly flavor, where it seems that they overcompensated the fish flavors with mayo and other sauces.

The service was quite slow and the waitress was not attentive to the customer. Getting the bill probably took just as long as our entire meal. I do not recommend this place unless you are desperate for sushi and have no where else to go."}
{"text":"I've decided to take the plunge and write my first Yelp review. What better place to start than my favourite downtown restaurant, Solo Sushi Bekkan? I always have a fantastic experience here, but I will outline what happened during my most recent visit, which was yesterday.

I went for lunch with two friends who had never been here before, at 1:00. This is a hit-or-miss time since the restaurant is small with only a few tables, and it could be full. Luckily a table of 4 was leaving just as we got there, because there was only a table for 2 available.

We ordered water, which ended up being served in frosty glasses straight from the freezer, pre-lemonized and delicious. As for food, I got the lunch special ($8.95, must pay cash) with inari sushi instead of shrimp. One of my friends got the vegetable sushi set ($14.00 and seemed to go over well, especially the inari) and the other got the pork belly (so delicious that when it was done, she ordered a bowl of rice so she could pour the remaining sauce on it), and negima yaki.

The fish is fresh and succulent and the rice is warm.

The sushi set and the lunch special came with salad and miso soup. The salad is not your typical sushi combo salad; it has fresh sliced fruit (I think it is apple) and a homemade dressing. 

Both the soy sauce and wasabi are made from scratch, and the sushi chef adjusts the strength of the wasabi to what you order.

A couple of other things to note: you can only use cash or debit, they have had live fish delivered during the day (my boyfriend and I were there during one such delivery, and the fish was flapping against the sides of the styrofoam!), be prepared to spend a little more than the other sushi places in the area if you're going a la carte.

The only reason I wouldn't give Solo Sushi Bekkan 5 stars is because I do not want there to be a lineup every time I come. Enjoy this hidden treasure of a restaurant!"}

Tiny little sushi restaurant run by Japanese folks in the heart of downtown (which is a bit of a rarity in t-dot).  You'd miss it if you weren't specifically looking for it. 

The restaurant was fully booked with us having a group of 10 and another group of 8 behind us.  Sushi was fresh.  Good selection.  The highlight was probably the self brewed soy (don't bother asking for low sodium, this is the homemade stuff).  Great quality wasabi.  Service was a tad slow, especially since there really was only two groups, but we got service with a smile.

{"text":"I agree with most of the good things that have been said about the food here, however without any exaggeration it took 45 minutes for our food to arrive and we had not ordered anything fancy (in fact the only cooked portions was 1 dish of appetizer that came out well in advance of everything else). 
There were no refills on our tea (making that long wait for our food seem longer) and it lacked the extra effort to make the dining experience memorable (maybe a little complimentary salad, or ice cream/fruit at the end or even some fancy little candy with the bill).
The actual restaurant is a tiny hole in the wall and it's got nothing to write home about concerning their interior deco. And that includes a giant hole under the HVAC system covered up by a banner for some beer. 

On top of all that, the food here is more expensive than it should be, very easily could you run up a bill of $15 or more. But the argument can be made that the food is worth it, but then again there are a lot of sushi restaurants in the area for cheaper that could more than satisfy your craving at a cheaper price and quicker time. 

The staff were friendly enough though, my recommendation is use this as a take out option, just call well ahead."}
{"text":"You might miss this on Grosvener as you try and find it. If you've past Yonge street, you've gone too far. 

The food was good, but it's a bit a high price point if you veer from the lunch special ($8.95 for 6 maki rolls and 4 nigiri sushi, soup and salad). 

We got the Sashimi Lunch (soup+salad) $12 for 9 pieces and a big prawn. We also got $6.50 takoyaki. This would be enough for 2 people, however, the owner duped us and told us that it wouldn't be enough. And we decided to get the Salmon Belly ($7.50) which we couldn't even finish. Not too pleased about spending more money not necessary. 

The sashimi was fresh and nice big slabs, without being too thick. 

The menu overall has the basics of Japanese casual food like udon/sobs/ donburi/teriyakis with some extra izakaya type foods. 

Note also the artwork all done by the owner's 15 yr old daughter. She's so talented!!"}
{"text":"We decided to have dinner at this little restaurant as we live just down the street from it and had never been, but especially because this location is closing this Friday due to a new development coming in. 

Went around 6pm and had no problems finding a table. Like the other reviews mention, the place is tiny with maybe seating for 20 people at most. There's also a small sushi bar that seats 3 people. When the restaurant was full by around 7pm, it began to feel really cramped and super noisy. In addition, there was only one waitress working all the tables and she definitely looked overworked and exhausted. 

The food was subpar, underwhelming, and a complete disappointment. We ordered the mackerel appetizer, salmon & avocado roll, rainbow roll, and the makimon set (3 sets of rolls). Mackerel was a good portion size, but way too salty and a bit overcooked. Salmon & avocado roll was nothing special, but heavy on the rice. Rainbow roll was a bit a different in that instead of alternating fish, one end was tuna, middle was avocado, and the other end was salmon. The rice however had too much vinegar mixed into it. The makimon set was a let down as well (no surprise at this point!). The tuna rolls in the set barely had any tuna in it with 2 out of the 6 rolls only having a piece of tuna the size of your nail!! Like all the other rolls, it was overloaded with rice. The rolls themselves were not fully wrapped and was basically falling apart! 

I'm not sure what all the good reviews are referring to - maybe I should've ordered sashimi instead. This location is moving to a different location closeby, but I'm not even sure how they're still in business with this kind of quality sushi. 

Save your time and money, and go to the all you can eat sushi restaurant (Sushi Sky) just around the corner."}
{"text":"last night I tried the Chef's bento box $25.   They also had Uni on special so I ordered that and some Unagi sushi.  The Uni was melt in your mouth, velvety and custard like.  yum!  The Unagi was freshly grilled.  The Bento box had tempura, tuna tartar (like poke if you're been to Hawaii, otherwise you won't know what I am talking about), salmon belly and 5 pieces of sushi.  All fish (no fake crab or other cheap substitutes!).  

Salmon, tuna, Tai I think, then white tuna and the last one was scallop! OMG, it was so good.  it was on the board as a special but she said they didn't have enough to make orders...lucky me to get that!  

Hubby had their University Sushi set.  I definitely got the better deal I think though his was $18 I think. 

Again rice is nicely done, not stuck together and over dressed and the fish were thickly sliced and the right temperature.  I've had white tuna before but it's partly frozen still and we're waiting for it to defrost before we can eat it.  This was just the right temperature.  HEAVEN!"}
{"text":"PROS:
1. Authentic Japanese food downtown! We went for the lunch special which is $9 otherwise the items are pricey. The nigiri was deeeeeeelicious and beautifully plated, maki underwhelming but decent. Next time I go I think I will splurge for dinner. We also tried the crispy salmon belly, was cooked to crispy perfection! 

2. Decor/restaurant itself is very cute and small. I love the table settings. I think this is what sold me the most. The little chopstick holders and napkin rings themselves made me happy.

3. Service is friendly and fast. No issues here.

CONS:
1. Not enough nigiri for my iiking, but you get what you pay for. (remember: quality over quantity*)

2. Only 1 lunch special. 

OVERALL:

-I suggest splurging and getting the special dishes/bento boxes with a side of nigiri. Makis didn't do it for me. 
-For $9 sushi lunch downtown, I'd consider it a steal. 
-Would be nice for a date.
-I plan to go again for dinner. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a quiet, small sushi joint. Their fish quality is really fresh. But their 39$ dollar bento chef's selection is not worth. (potato cakes LOL) 

But their salmon sashimi and sea urchin sushi is REALLY GOOD and not too expensive. Highly recommend those."}
{"text":"Surprisingly Fresh sushi at a cute tiny restaurant. 
Poor service."}
{"text":"Simply the best.

Probably the best sushi I've had in Toronto. Even though the place is small, the selection of seafood is quite large and quite rare.  Between my friend and I, we had assorted nigiri, chirashi, grilled mackerel and uni. My favourite was the mackerel, though everything was fresh and everything was good. The ginger and wasabi were good too, but the soy sauce was lighter and sweeter than most. It wasn't bad, it was just... unexpected."}
{"text":"A fairly decent place to drop by! 

The location is VERY packed, this was the first time I had to sit at the bar.  (Since I'm a loner this isn't much of an issue :P)

I ordered a spicy salmon and tuna roll, with an extra order of salmon sashimi

I'm not sure whether it was the soy sauce or not, but the food ended up tasting a little sweet.  Though this wasn't too big of a problem, as the food was still delicious.  

The spicy rolls had a nice crunch to it that makes the texture that much more appealing, there was onion in the rolls, but they weren't overpowering like they often are when they are put in the rolls.  

One thing I find interesting is that they put too much water in their wasabi.  After I saw a few photos of people jokingly saying this, I figured it was just a one-time mistake.  However when I received my food, the wasabi was just about to seep into the sashimi.Very odd!

Overall the experience was quite nice.  Very tight place, with a rather interesting soy sauce.  I would prefer a saltier one next time, but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"First time here - a pretty small place, when you come in it's a single small room with minimal but tasteful decor.  Seats 18 plus 2 at the bar.  Arriving at 11:30 we were the first ones there, but by 12:15 it was full, so show up early!

Unfortunately their fume hood was broken so we were limited to sushi, sashimi, and limited warm dishes (nothing fried).  However, the lunch special (salad, miso soup, ,assorted maki and salmon/shrimp nigiri) at $8.95 was very nice, and well above average quality for standard Japanese fare.  The salad was nice - a spring mix rather than iceberg lettuce, and a tasty dressing unlike the typical neon carrot ginger stuff you get elsewhere.  The miso soup was good too, though it did not have many 'chunks' of seaweed, tofu, or anything else if that's what you like..  I also had the salmon sashimi (4 pcs for $7), which was nice and sweet.  The wasabi came in a soft semi-runny consistency, unlike the hard ball you usually get, which was actually nice as it dissolved very easily into the soy sauce.  Oh, and nice chopsticks!

The bad?  Service wasn't great.  We sat for quite a while and had to flag down the only waitress to take our order (menus were clearly closed, and we were at the time the only patrons).  Tea and water refills were not offered (nor was a pot of tea provided), and when it came time to pay we once again had to flag down the waitress.  Payment was cash/debit only (no credit).  

In fairness, they were likely running behind - the subway was down and they were an hour late getting in, arriving just before they opened their doors.  Based on the quality of the food, I'd definitely go back.."}
{"text":"Their lunch special was very good.  For $8.95 you get four pieces of sushi (we got salmon, tuna, ebi and rice in a tofu pocket) plus 6 pieces of maki (we got 3 spicy tuna and 3 tempura yam maki). It came with a salad (didn't care for it too much as they  skimped on the dressing) and great miso soup.  We found that we didn't have enough food so we ordered a spider roll to top up our meal - it was really good.

Overall, it's more pricey than the other sushi joints in the area but you get much better quality of fish. I will be back to try their omakase that seems so many have been raving about."}
{"text":"As a sushi snob this is one of a handful of places in the city that I consider to be a top choice. I have visited dozens of times over the years and still remember my first time. The chef told me all about their fish and styles of sushi preparation. The flavour combinations are simple and their rice is perfect texture. They make their soy sauce and wasabi on site (delicious). Small place, so be prepared to get close with your neighbours."}
{"text":"Freshest sushi I've ever had. Melts in your mouth! My favourite sushi place in downtown toronto!"}
{"text":"The chef and owner of Solo Sushi Ya in Newmarket decided to expand and opened up a second restaurant in downtown Toronto in the summer of 2009. As expected, the offerings don't disappoint.

I've had the omakase twice, and sampled the a la carte fare a number of times, and the quality of the preparation is on the whole excellent, and the fish always fresh.

The few times where the food has faltered has been with the nigiri, where the rice is a little too loosely packed, or the sashimi slices not quite uniform. Mind you, this only happens when it's one of the assistant chefs who's doing the preparation. Jyo, the owner and head chef is only present on Mondays and Tuesdays, so the best service will be had on those days.

Overall, this is one of the best sushi restaurants in terms of value in the downtown area. The variety of fish will not be as esoteric as what you could get, say at Kaji Sushi or Take Sushi, but it is always very fresh. The owner reasons that he can't yet afford to offer the more interesting and therefore more expensive fishes because he's not sure how they'll be received. That being said, there's always great salmon, tuna, hamachi and amaebi to be had here. And what seems to be real wasabi is always offered.

Give the 'bekkan'* a try; hopefully they'll be successful and we'll have a fine sushi restaurant in a part of town that otherwise is populated by mediocre offerings.

* I believe this means, \"the other restaurant\" in reference to the original one in Newmarket"}
{"text":"This tiny little shop will surprise you with the high quality of sushi they offer. My husband and I went here for lunch. The small shop was cozy but if you do not come early, there is very limited seating. Take out is convenient but not open for lunch on Saturday and Sunday(which is when I want to eat it the most!) The wasabi is super spicy so use less than normal. I love this place more than Sushi Sky on Yonge."}
{"text":"I came here with a few of my coworkers a few Fridays ago.  
They were saying to me, \"We're heading out for sushi.  Wanna come?\" 
Me: \"Yeah sure! Where?\"
Them: \"Solo Sushi.  It's supposed to be really good -- they have their chef from Newmarket.\"
Me: \"Uh... Excuse me!?  A sushi restaurant that I've never been to or heard of?!\"  Yeah.  I had to go check it out.

The restaurant is small, fits about 15 people or so.  We luckily made reservations for about 8 people prior to lunch (hence we took up about half the restaurant).  They have lunch specials, so that was great. I had ordered myself the \"Queen Set,\" which had nigiri and makis, soup, and salad.  The salad was different form your average sushi place, so you know it's going to be good.

All in all, it was awesome -- the only complaints that I have is that it's small, and you walk out smelling like the food (tempura oil); it's small; there is a lack of air conditioning; and that there is a lack of food choices for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Zannnng, I came in here for a lunch with co-workers. Mad props.

$8.95 lunch special (cash only, jerks) was top drawer. Green salad (with a dressing that DID NOT SUCK), miso (which surprisingly wasn't that great), and a maki/nigiri set. The latter came with six rolls (two kinds), three nigiri slabs o' fish, and a sweet tofu pouch o' rice.

Service was speedy. The place is small though, and gets rammed with public servants pretty much right at noon, so dip from work a bit earlier to secure a seat."}
{"text":"Been here last few weeks. Sashimi is very fresh, sushi is okay, a special soup kinda thing is great."}
{"text":"While Guu gets all the attention, I'm starting to realize there are so many great, casual little Japanese eateries in the downtown core... Authentic, Japanese-run places serving sushi but also tasty small dishes typical of izakayas in Japan. Solo Sushi Bekkan is one of them! (Others: Ematei, Tokyo Kitchen, Koyoi). So nice to see a widening appreciation for Japanese cuisine outside of AYCE sushi. After reading the positive reviews on Yelp and hearing good things from friends, I decided to try this place out. (Well, one of the real clinchers was when I read that dancer/choreographer Peggy Baker eats here regularly: http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/trick+getting+dance+When+looking+that/6024203/story.html). 

The place is super-tiny and simple, in terms of decor. Went for dinner on a weeknight and luckily there were a couple tables available (since it's small and off Yonge St., you'd probably miss this place if you weren't specifically looking for it) . The server was really nice and seemed excited about the food. He started recommending his favourites immediately once we sat down, and even waxed poetic about the health and wellness benefits of seaweed salad. So, we had to order that. It had several different kinds of seaweed and was really flavourful and light. Other standouts were the chicken karaage (not too oily or batter-y) agedashi tofu (the broth and toppings were really hearty) and monkfish fingers. We got some spicy salmon rolls too, which were good, but not really different from anywhere else. Will definitely come back as the menu is pretty big and they have lots of specials. I want to try their hot pot next time!"}
{"text":"Tiny restaurant with some quality food!  The sashimi was nice and fresh, and not too bad for the price.  We ordered mainly sushi and sashimi and their spider roll was definitely delicious.  The agedashi tofu was so good, with many bonito flakes added.

Next time, I'd like to try the Omakase.  It's not the cheapest out there but definitely quality among the sea of Japanese restaurants lining Yonge St."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Solo tonight. Had relatives visiting from BC who are Big fans of Sushi. This was not our first time at Solo and will not be our last. We got very special treatment from the regular waiter, who recognizes us each time we're in.  He is very personable and takes a great deal of time talking about the food at the restaurant, which demonstrates his great knowledge of the food, which to us as diners is a great quality! Warning, if you're going, you have to be prepared for a bit of a longer dinner! Overall it's a great experience. 

This time when we went we just got an assortment of apps, but our previous time there we got the Omakase dinner, when the main chef was working (a Friday night) and it was definitely worth the $55/person. If you're going to get it I recommend getting it when the head chef is in, he does a phenomenal job, that being said, the other chef who works there on the other days is great too! Just make sure you go with a big appetite, if not I recommend the chef's bento box, it is very similar to the Omakase, just a few less courses. 

I definitely have no complaints about this place. There is a wide variety of items on the menu to choose from and the waiter there is very knowledgable about the food. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good Sushi restaurant in the downtown area."}
{"text":"The prices are above average for a sushi restaurant, but then again, most of the places I've been to in this city have been fairly crappy. This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Toronto.

Portions are relatively small compared to dishes with the same names at other restaurants - but it's definitely enough to make you full, and the quality of the stuff you eat is pretty damn high compared to other run-of-the-mill \"Japanese restaurants\".

-They make their own soy sauce and wasabi, you won't find supermarket squeeze-tube wasabi here.
-Their salads are more nutritious than average. Here you don't get iceberg lettuce with some j*zz on it - they use more nutritious vegetables and the dressing is house made
-Fish is always fresh
-Staff are very friendly

Only one possible con I can think of - they mucked up a reservation once. They don't seem so good at timing those during the busy Friday/Saturday nights. However, the owner recognized me the next time I came in and apologized so all's good."}
{"text":"Very good sushi from a very small, off the main street location. 

Place only has room for about 16 people but the food is very good. Price is what you would expect from this sort of location and the staff is very friendly and patient. 

Ordered a bento box as well as some extra sushi and I was stuffed. The bento box alone probably could have filled me up. 

Overall great place to eat a sushi meal."}
{"text":"Good place to get Japanese food. 
Esp good appetizers.
Not the cheapest place in town but the sushi is def worth checking out. 
It's a tiny place so you have to squeeze yourself in and you will be pretty close to your neighbour table. 
But good food."}
{"text":"This place prides itself on the quality of ingredients they use and the care they put into preparing their food. The owner is a really nice guy too. I would probably need another try, but from my experience there was nothing special about the freshness of ingredients and the overall quality of food. It wasn't bad or anything, it was just...normal. Nothing extraordinary. I had a bento box and would need to go back to try their rolls, sashimi and other dishes on the menu to better make up my mind. However, with so much competition in the downtown core, for every restaurant like Solo Sushi, there's 3-5 more in the radius of 1km vying for you to dine at their restaurant."}
{"text":"Consistency is a common issue faced by most restaurants in Toronto and Solo is no exception. Been here a year back and had a rather enjoyable meal with above-average sashimi and unique izakaya-like dishes. Tonight, not so much. The sashimi has hit the bottom of the barrel. Not comparing it to Tsukiji Market but for the prices they charge (slightly above-average) I would rather go across the street to Kokyo Sushi. The batter they used for their tempura and monkfish was thick but without the crispiness and rather soggy instead. The rolls were heavy on rice stuffed with too much imitation crab/cucumbers/avocado (not very presentable either). The grilled squid was drenched in soy sauce and vegetable oil which not only reminded me of a steamed fish dish at your nearby chinese restaurant - which was confusing - but just made it unnecessarily heavy and the togarashi wasn't necessary: keep it simple re: ND sushi. I realize the bill was no where near Kaji, Nami, Katsura, or Jiro level but this restaurant has lost its identity as being 'that japanese restaurant in the downtown core that's not an izakaya that garnered Toronto Life's attention and landed 3/5 stars\". However, you're not cheaper than the sushi place down the street with the sign that says $5 lunch special or AYCE either. 

As a yuppie willing to spend a little more but reluctant to drive all the way to Kaji, I would almost rather eat at one of the 800 izakaya/ramen/AYCE joints downtown, save the money, and probably have a better time. Yes, I would rather go to Japango even.. Not demanding fresh Toro/Uni or expect prices to be lower than what I paid, but this place needs to revamp it's menu and bring back that 'unique' flare that it once had. Otherwise, we'll just walk across the street to Guu like everyone else...haven't said that, I will come back to give the Omakase (still, your a la carte has to be up to par). 

Dishes: sashimi a la carte (hamachi, tuna, sweet shrimp), fried monkfish, tempura set,  tonkatsu, seaweed salad, grilled squid, rainbow roll, eel avocado roll, 3 sopporos. $150 tax includ."}
{"text":"Fresh meat and mediocre service. We mainly come here for their authentic Japanese food! The only annoying thing is their sign about asking their customers not to pay with credit card. I find it weird that they have that message on every single page of their menu. Otherwise solid Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Solo Sushi Bekkan is easily, hands down, one of the best Japanese restaurants in Toronto that serves the freshest, melt in your mouth sashimi. I've tried the rolls and katsu which are good, but I'd recommend the sashimi sets so you can taste the freshness and delicacy of the fish. It is pricey but worth the money. The restaurant is really small and makes a cute date spot."}
{"text":"Lunch Specials!! $8.95 cash only for miso soup, salad and 4 piece of sushi and 1 maki room all Chef's Surprise.. 

I was pleasantly surprise as my sushi were all fantastic! My tuna roll was so so so good... just melt in my mouth while I enjoyed every single piece slowly. The wasabi definitely not from the tube! 

Love the small and friendly vibe of Solo Sushi Bekkan! Eating here really makes me feel like eating in one of the small sushi place in Japan! 

I want to come back and try out other item of the menu!"}
{"text":"I got the Yokohama Maki. It tasted decent. This place would get 3 stars on food alone if the prices weren't higher than other sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto.

I walked past this unassuming sushi joint once or twice before eating here. The venue is very much a hole in the wall but is often loaded to the rafters with patrons which gives it a very Japanese feel.

My first time coming to the restaurant, it was quite quiet and so the sushi chef came out himself to take our order. Jyo-san is one of these chefs who is highly passionate about the food he serves and he insisted that we eat bluefin tuna given that it was only available fresh one week per year and this was that week. Seeing that I was interested in this subject Jyo-san pulled up a chair and chatted with me about bluefin tuna fishing laws in Canada, the US and globally. After the conversation was complete, he politely excused himself and then prepared the best sushi meal I've had outside of Japan. I've been a loyal customer to SSB ever since.

The food here is consistently well-prepared. Fish is sourced with some pride and is prepared in this same way. This is not sushi that you would get outside Tsukiji Market mind you, but its definitely a cut above the other sushi offerings I've had in town. The soy sauce is tangier, the ginger is fresher, the wasabi freshly grated and all the fish tastes fresh and dressed or seasoned appropriately. 

While the staff are typically nice and friendly, my one knock is that Jyo-san is not himself in the restaurant as much as I would like. He is often working in Newmarket at his larger sushi house. That said, his sous-chef is a very capable hand, if not quite the same character. With that said, when I returned to SSB after having been living abroad for 2 years, Jyo-san recognized me and treated me to a special dish. You can't beat that type of service.

Whenever I am looking to have a nice, more authentic sushi meal - whether it be for a date, a meal with an old friend or showing off Toronto's sushi quality - this is where I go."}
{"text":"Great place. Super fresh sushi, amazing service, and the staff are so polite. Would visit this place more often if it wasn't so pricey, but definitely fulfills my sushi cravings. Love the chirashi."}
{"text":"It was my second time at this place and I will definitely not be returning. 

It took over 30 minutes to get our order. 

I had the salmon Sushi and the shrimp tempura. And my friend had the shrimp tempura and California roll. 
She had to send the California roll back as the avocado was blackened. The Salmon was also black and had a funny smell to it"}
{"text":"I love sushi and it disturbs me to give a bad review, but I'd really never go back to this place.  We were a party of 3 and were asked first if we'd like a drink.  Saki sounded good, so we said we'd have a large one.  The waitress arrived with 3 bottles, papa, mama, and baby.  We picked baby, 300ml and I was surprised when she asked if we wanted it hot or cold.  In my experience (in Japan), some saki is made to be served hot, others cold--you don't normally leave it to the patron.  And interestingly, it's the cold saki that is more high end.  It came in what looked like an ice bucket of hot water.  

My hand roll set (14.00) consisted of only 3 hand rolls, 2 with minced fish mixed with what tasted like green peppers and maybe other vegetables, instead of a solid piece of fish, and one which was a piece of that fake crab.  The chopped fish was definitely not to my liking.  It tasted as though it was mixed with unidentifiables.  And the rice inside was so overcooked, it almost tasted like porridge.  I asked the waitress to come over and told her that I really didn't like the dish.  She then spoke to the chef, returned and told me I should talk with him.  I left the meal mostly uneaten and neither waitress nor chef minded in the least.

The bill came and the baby bottle of saki was $30.  My husband was rather shocked and asked about that too.  But again, they were absolutely fine with all of it.  I hope they are just as fine with us making this a one-time visit.   There is much better food and service almost anywhere else."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place~ Went here when I wanted some hot soup and their tempera udon did the trick.

Was very happy eating their yummy udon.. just the right thickness and chewiness. There was one shrimp tempera in the basket, but I liked the sweet potato one. Nice petite shop.

edit:
Came back for lunch. Wow this time was mind blowing good. Had the tako-wasabi and fish liver. Just amazing. And the well priced lunch special sushi. The appetizers made it amazing.

Should comment on the shop. Love the decor~ Owner is very friendly. The drawing in the shop are by his daughter. It is very quaint with a nice flowerpot on the window still."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese food. On the pricey end, but it was certainly delicious - especially the wasabi!!! 

Very small joint, can't really find the place until you really look for it. It seats about 8 tables. 

My friend and I came by on a Wednesday evening, the place was not too busy, so service was quick. We ordered miso soup, salad, tempura appetizer, spider roll, spicy salmon, and salmon sushi. 
The miso soup was a tad salty, but the usual miso soup taste. 
The salad was a much bigger portion than the regular sushi joints that I have been to. 
Tempura appetizer came with two of each of shrimps, pumpkin, pepper, zucchini, eggplant, and broccoli. 
The spider roll was awesome! 
The spicy salmon roll had a lot of rice, but it was still good. 
The salmon sushi was very fresh. 

Overall, I will come back one day if I'm around the area and craving sushi."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner and ordered the Omakase.. This is worth the time and money.. 

To start we have the combo 3 tasty cold appy - Marinated Natto Beans, Japanese Mashed Potato and Tuna Tataki.. 
2nd course - Sashimi, 
3rd course - Chawamushi (sp?), 
4th course - Miso Salmon, 
5th course - Sushi and 
finished with dessert. 

The food is very fresh and well prepared. Their wasabi and soy sauce are made in house and taste light and not too salty. 

This restaurant is very small and have room for 20 people. 

Best to go to their other location in Newmarket, ON if you have a big group."}
{"text":"Busy and tiny location just off of Yonge Street.   We went just after lunchtime, when it appeared the rush was just leaving - it was packed, but then empty once we sat down.

The service was good, and they offered standard sushi fare.   They have some really great lunch deals however!    We had some sashimi and assorted rolls - these came with salad and miso soup to start which was a nice surprise.   The salmon was pretty tasty, especially in the rolls.   Some of the fish seemed a bit old, not as fresh as it could've been.   The soya sauce was interesting, kind of thick and sweeter than normal soya sauces I've had before.

Overall it was a good experience, but had some not as good as could be fish."}
