{"text":"Had grilled chicken wrap hardly any chicken and it was bland, salad was head lettuce and 2 slices of raw tomato, pizza tasted burnt had one bite and threw it out. I figured one thing might be good but very disappointed in the food! I would suggest removing things from the menu that your not going to work hard on or your not going to be around for long..."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place. The only good thing about it was our server was fast, but that was mostly due to the fact that we were the only ones in there at 5:30 Saturday night.   As we looked over the menu, seeing the high price points we thought we'd be getting some good homemade Italian.  We were wrong. The bread and salad aren't anything special. They were fine. We got some mozzarella sticks to start, it was clear that they were frozen. $7 for 6 frozen cheese sticks?! No thanks. But the real disappointment came when dinner showed up. My wife had the baked ziti. Once you get passed the fact that it's boxed pasta with a ridiculous amount of cheese on top, you find it also has the most flavorless sauce either of us has ever tasted. Not nearly worth the $14.  I had the chicken parm sub. It was doused with way too much of the flavorless sauce and way too much cheese as well. It made the bottom of the bun so soggy it was difficult to pick up. And on top of all that, the chicken was nothing more than a frozen chicken tender!   It's a shame because we really did want this place to be good, we need more around here, but I work way too hard to spend my money on low quality pasta at a high price."}
{"text":"I went to eat there tonight. I NEVER ever ever complain about restaurant service because I have been a server and I know what it's like to get overwhelmed. My waitress was the WORST I have ever had in my life. I am tempted to call the owners to let them know. She came over to the table, didn't say hi or introduce herself. She just said \"what do you want to drink?\" At the end of our meal she just set the check down and said \"here's your check.\" Didn't ask how it was, didn't ask if we wanted dessert. THEN when I paid and left the book on the edge of the table she came and took it without saying \"have a good night\" or \"thank you!\" It was a very terrible first impression of that place and I'm extremely disappointed. They should have done a better job at hiring someone. I was completely blown away. First impressions are everything at a new business and it was horrible.  As for the food it wasn't good enough for me to really want to go again."}
{"text":"Wandered over on a late Monday night... Owner kept the bar open just to welcome us for our first time! Couldn't believe how genuine and personable this gentleman was to us! Great local beer and wonderful homemade Italian food! Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"Food is Great but the need to improve service to survive.  Went for lunch last Sunday after Church and got there right when the open at 11:00 am. Needless to say, we were the first ones there. A gentleman who I assume was the owner was still cleaning up and appeared to be the only one there. Other employees including our server drifted in over the next 20 minutes of so but needless to say, were not at their station at opening.  After our server arrived and went to the back, another couple came in and reviewed the menu board for almost 5 minutes and when no one asked them if they needed help, left to I assume fine another place for lunch.  When we walked in, the gentleman cleaning indicated we could sit anywhere we wanted. My wife chose a table and he brought over silverware and menu's. We both ordered tea and he indicated he would have to make some because none had been made yet.  I kidded that he had to forgive my wife for her unsweetened tea because she is a Yankee and he indicated that he was also and it turns out, he's from Buffalo.  That explains the Beef on Weck on the menu.  My wife ordered the Chicken Marsala while I ordered the Beef on Weck with a side of French Fries.  We both are now fans of the food. Marsala had a nice fresh note to it and the Beef on Weck was as good as any you get in Western NY. Portions were more than ample and the Horseradish would bring tears to your eyes if you were not careful. In other words, perfect.  I know they have only been open for two or three weeks and if they address start up mistakes and miscues like the ones mentioned above, they may become a local favorite. Food is great and is well prepared but that will only carry you so far if the service expectations are not met.  At the end of the meal while I was settling the check, my wife went to the ladies room and came back and indicated the facilities were immaculate and she had rarely seen a facility as clean as this one. As a matter of fact, the restaurant is very clean throughout and it is obvious that this is an area they take great care with.  As far the music, apparently someone likes the Blues which is OK but cut the volume down a bit.  We will definitely be back again and hopefully they will have made progress on these problems."}
{"text":"I waited a few weeks to give this place a try since I hadn't heard great things via word of mouth from \"foodie\" friends that were disappointed after going when it first opened. I went for lunch and it was pretty empty. Seems that one server was working all (maybe three) different tables as well as a customer at the bar. (There was also a big pile of Barilla pasta packages on top of the bar.) The waitress (Erika) was friendly and attentive. The space was clean and relatively small. There are tables and large booths with a bar in the center that has additional bar stool seating.   The menu is exhausting: Appetizers, Pizza, hot/cold subs, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, pasta, chicken, steak, seafood, sides, kids options, dessert. Considering their website says \"We bring you the Italian classics made from scratch...\", I decided to go with a classic Italian dish, the baked ziti. It was a little more than I typically spend on lunch out ($14) but it did come with a salad and bread. The salad (Caesar, with no croutons per request) arrived first and was swimming in dressing. The baked ziti was ziti pasta lightly coated with marinara and topped with a dense layer of cheese. No ricotta layers, just ziti and red sauce and melted white cheese. Baked ziti from scratch would include a ricotta/egg/parsley/Parmesan mixture layered in between the noodles and sauce to give it a rich, thick & creamy tomato cheese sauce. It would be like making lasagna without the ricotta mixture layered between sauce, cheese and noodles. All in all it was overpriced for the product delivered. Kids meals are $7 and dessert is $8."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was the home style Italian service. I was amazed by the handcrafted wood bar and the classical Italian food. You'd be amazed by the staff and the service. The bar staff was amazing and the food was fantastic! The meatballs are one of a kind! \"Ordinary or Extraordinary?\" Which would you rather have? This place is Extraordinary!!"}
{"text":"Four stars for promise.  They are learning the ropes, and some of the food needs a little work, but perfectly decent right now.  Excellent house made French fries and lovely, earnest, friendly waitstaff that is still figuring things out.  We will be back, because 1) there is potential, 2) it is not a chain!! 3) there are no TVs, and music is at a nice low level where you actually TALK to each other.  And 5) cute bar with great seating.  We will go back to have drinks there because it is a nicer atmosphere than anywhere else around."}
{"text":"I may be extremely biased. Mother from Italy and grew up in Boston near the North End.   There were some good things - Sauce was very good. Not to sweet good acidity. Salad was tossed well - even coating of dressing on the lettuce and nice and crisp.  Dipping sauce for the bread was good - olive oil, butter and garlic. The chicken parmesan chicken was dry.  The spaghetti was welllllllll overcooked and mushy.   There were some thing that could use improvement - The alfredo was bland - tasted of heated cream with no cheese. Parmesan had to be added for flavor and believe it or not - lacking salt.  The fettuccini was cooked well - still slightly al dente.  The asparagus were seasoned beautifully.  The portions were large - one plate of pasta could have easily fed my husband and myself.   Cute bar area and wine list look decent. Good prices. Will update review if we decide to go back."}
{"text":"Homemade Italian done fabulously well! Chicken Alfredo & Chicken Masala were both absolutely delizioso! Crazy good wings! (With blue cheese-always with blue cheese!) Can't wait to come back for a pizza!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza.  We have had it twice and it was amazing both times.  Craft beer selection is TERRIBLE.  D9 makes average beer at best and that's what they offer on tap along with the normal crud like Blue Moon.   Bottles and cans are no better.  Charlotte has a huge local craft beer scene and they aren't taking advantage of it.  The owner should visit Eastfield Bar and Grill on a Saturday and figure out why they are crowded and his business isn't.   Entrees have been hit or miss for us.  Service is just okay.  Improve the craft beer selection and your bar/restaurant will flourish."}
