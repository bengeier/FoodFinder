{"text":"Probably one of the rudest staff I have ever come across! Don't ever order here!! The lady was extremely condescending and rude, waited almost an hour for a burger."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Have gotten both catering and dine in there. They have wonderful ciabatta subs with southwest turkey or caprese subs. Definitely worth a visit or get for catering."}
{"text":"This is on my building where I work so I frequent it often.. the staff is hit or miss with their attitude"}
{"text":"Wow, is this really a restaurant? No. It's a cafeteria in an office building accessible only by elevator. They ran out of rye bread for the dry corned beef, slathered it with too much mustard, and dumped some salad along side it in a take out box, even though I was only going out to the atrium to eat. The inside \"table service\" area was empty, and we had a big table outside with a view. Other than that it was great! If you can find this place, and it's your only choice, go for it. If you work in the building I'm sure it's just the thing for a quick lunch, but as far as advertising it as a destination restaurant? That's quite a stretch."}
{"text":"In my office building. Used to get pretty good decent food. However there are some new employees and they cannot cook to save their lives. I've had the wings twice and both times they were so over cooked they were inedible. The fries are either over cooked or undercooked. The ability to cook should be a prerequisite to be hired."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with a co-worker and took a look around the two sides of this restaurant/caf√©. One side serves hot food and the other side serves cold food. I opted for hot food and selected a chicken wrap with rice and sauteed veggies. It took about 10 minutes to get my wrap, but it was worth waiting for. The chicken was grilled earlier and heated up on the flat top along with my veggies. After building the burrito, the chef grilled it for a minute to heat it up. I grabbed a bottle of raspberry tea and a free cookie, courtesy of yelp.  You can sit outdoors with a nice view of Lake Erie, but it was a bit too windy for us on the day we visited. My lunch was $10 and it was tasty. I probably won't be back because of the high price. I can get a similar amount of food for $8 at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Great prices and pretty fast. 10min wait. In a building overlooking the river. We got a New Yorker and Greek Wrap. Both very good."}
{"text":"We recently had a problem with a delivery service when trying to order from David's Grill & Bar. The delivery service gave us a MAJOR runaround and tried to get out of refunding our money for the trouble with the orders/delivery. David personally made the situation right at HIS expense.  The food and service are fantastic, the menu is HUGE and full of healthy options. Will be ordering from here again very soon!"}
