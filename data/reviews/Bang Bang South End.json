{"text":"Amazing as the other spot and walkable to my place.  Try the sriracha burger if you like spicy - I think it's unique to this spot."}
{"text":"This place is in a great location.  Location is close to a lot of local breweries and creative offices.  I had the bang bang burger with some fries.  Wow amazing.  The sauce they served with the burger and fries was great.  The environment had a brewery style feel with brick wall and wood flooring/ table tops."}
{"text":"This is a cute place. Fun environment and good selection of burgers! 

I ordered the single Bang Bang burger with sweet potato fries. I really enjoyed the bang sauce on my burger. It was cooked correctly and very tasty. The sweet potato fries were a win too! They come with this very yummy dipping sauce!

Service was spot on as well! Overall, an excellent experience! 

If you're on the hunt for a great burger - this is your spot."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. Even better fires. Perfect cook with crispy outside and soft inside. The staff was incredibly kind and courteous. It felt very clean and well organized. Tables were being cleaned effectively and promptly."}
{"text":"BEST burger I have ever had! I got the special burger of the week. It had fried brie cheese, Canadian bacon, arugula, and pear compote on it. It was seriously killer. The service was also beyond wonderful. The staff were so warm & welcoming. I am going to make this a weekly stop for me!"}
{"text":"Great space. Kind staff. Good burger. Soggy fries. Given fries & price...not a 4 star value. Want to like it, like Del Frisco's, but would explore before repeating."}
{"text":"I was really, really excited to try Bang Bang Bites. Bang Bang Burgers is one of the best spots in town, so I knew the bite sized option had to be equally as good, if not better. 

Unfortunately, I came away disappointed. Three sliders, fries and a drink were close to $18. The burgers themselves weren't nearly as juicy as the ones I have eaten at Bang Bang Burgers. 

Overall, glad I tried it, but probably won't make my way back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of bang bang burgers in Elizabeth. I was very excited for the south end location to open. I tried it when they were serving sliders and I was satisfied with the food per price but preferred the regular burgers. Happy they changed to the original as they're the best burgers in town!

Inside is clean and both times I've been I have found parking and seating. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.

My favorite is the bang bang burger. The sauce is amazing and I always order extra to dip my fries in. Their meat is high quality and their pickles are wonderful, I've thought about ordering a side of pickles before! The fries are tasty and I loved the sweet potato chips- they were crisp and lightly salted."}
{"text":"Honestly, I had high hopes for bang bang bites Since bang bang burgers is my favorite burger place in Charlotte. I have to say that I was very disappointed. It is overpriced for what you get. I ordered the fried mac & cheese in the bacon cheddar sliders. The fried mac & cheese was pretty good. The bacon cheddar was a joke. It was tiny with melted shredded cheese. The patties were very small and did not fill the buns. My fries tasted like they were cooked 10 minutes before I ordered. I've never had that problem at the original bang bang. I don't think that we will be going back unless something changes regarding the menu at bang bang bites. I do appreciate the concept and that they're giving the opportunity for people to try different burger toppings. We will stick with bang bang burgers in the future."}
{"text":"So good.  I got the bleu bacon jam burger.  Savory, sweet, great combination.  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wife wanted to try this place out before the Checkers game. This was the Saturday after it opened so I will give a pass on some things but overall, I wasn't real impressed. First, things were coming soon-beer(was not happy about this. I really wanted a beer with my sliders) and specials- even though there probably wouldn't have been one on a Saturday. Menu is sort of small, which coincidentally is the same as the sliders. For me, two bites and it was gone. Even my wife was a little disappointed in how small they were. Sliders tasted fine. The fried mac and cheese slider was my favorite. I was a little disappointed with the Sriracha slider as it didn't seem to have a lot of flavor. Sliders come with BBQ chips which were good. I did notice they seem to have these ready to just put on plates which made me worry they have be old but mine were good. Personally, I thought it was overpriced for the amount of food you get. Two sliders was $11, three for $15 and that did not include a drink. We will give it another try maybe after beer is finally being sold."}
{"text":"Holy moly I'm obsessed with this place!! Absolutely my new \"go to\" when I am craving a burger. Service is great and the staff is super friendly. They have plenty of inviting seating that actually makes you want to sit and eat your burger instead of taking it to go. There is a huge TV in the middle as well. There are canned beers to purchase to wash down the tastiness. 

My husband got the Cowboy burger with fries and I got the black bean burger with brussels. The portions are just right and everything tasted delicious! It leaves you completely satisfied instead of that \"I over ate\" feeling."}
{"text":"30 minute wait for 3 sliders. Wrong order brought out twice. No beer or alcohol yet. Cold food. Cheese not melted. Beef not seasoned. I can't find a single redeeming quality about this place. I would give it 0 stars if that were an option. Bang bang burgers is my favorite burger in Charlotte but this place is embarrassing."}
{"text":"I'm sold. I always get the special and I've never been disappointed. Best burgers in Charlotte. Worth every penny. I've never had the double pattie burger because the single is enough.

My only suggestion is to work on the fries. I'm not a fan of the limp soggie \"hand cut\" fry.

These burgers with McDonald's fries would be the ultimate."}
{"text":"I would defiantly agree these might be the best burgers in Charlotte. We got the mushroom soup burger- I know!!! But it was beautiful :) perfectly cooked medium burger with a mushroom soup sauce over top oozing out with every bite. The bun was soft and fresh and fries hand cut happiness. A friend got a more traditional burger and absolutely loved it as well. I cant wait to try the next specialty burger they come up with :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. I have heard nothing but good things about the place on 7th street so I figured I'd give the bites place a try. The young man that took our order was very thorough on the process to order and gave us his opinion on any questions we had. The burgers had tons of flavor and cooked to perfection. The staff was friendly and the order came out in a reasonable amount of time. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Superb. I work in South End and used to live in Elizabeth, so I was pumped when I heard a new Bang Bang was coming to the area.

I ordered the Pimento Burger with fries to go. The burger was a perfect medium rare. Enough juice left to be messy, but not enough to run down to your elbows. Fries were delicious. 

They have a cool atmosphere in there as well. A couple TVs were tuned in to the Masters. Plenty of seating, but I imagine it gets crowded when they get busier."}
{"text":"I was seriously so excited to try this place, but it didn't live up to my expectations. However the staff was SO kind that I wanted to love it. I do give the staff a 5 Star review! My burger was so pink in the middle and it was so disappointing. I asked for a bacon cheddar ranch and didn't get any bacon (which is cmon the best part)! The guac that comes on the guac cheddar burger is good though! 

The burgers do not fill the buns. I think it's a really good concept but needs some extra help. I think having a small menu is smart right now because they need to learn from some of these reviews. 

The homemade chips are actually decent, BBQ flavor would be my fav! I will give it another shot but will def give it sometime before I come back..."}
{"text":"Let me start out by emphasizing my stars are more for customer service (5 stars) and speed of service. The staff was very friendly the place was clean. With that being said if I could give the food a separate grade it would be 3 stars. Hence my average rating of 4 stars. Today I had a revelation....I hate grass-fed ground beef! It has this funky taste that I can't put my finger on but for me it sucks! I consider myself a burger connoisseur and I can't believe how bad the grass makes the burger taste! Now I know why I hated the burgers at other Charlotte restaurants. (Dogwood, Porter's House, WholeFoods burger bar (South Park)). The fries were cooked perfectly except had little to no salt on them. My wife enjoyed her black bean burger bowl. As nice as this place is and I know it's popular I will not be returning. My favorite burger in Charlotte is still Bad Daddy's."}
{"text":"Best burger in charlotte. Go for the weekly special, it's always amazing. I would recommend a single patty over double, the meat to bun ratio is better. The patties are thick."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing! Tastefully our together and cooked to perfection. The atmosphere is nice as well. Out door seating and very clean. Also, the staff is very personable"}
{"text":"Great food, nice people, would highly recommend to others. Always greeted with smiles and the people there are so kind and polite. Go here if you like good burgers."}
{"text":"So good. Food coma won't let me type more other than the Sriracha burger had the perfect amount of heat. Order medium!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch ! Excellent slider options very flavorful. Chips and dips are awesome!!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the place, the ambiance and the music. Menu is short, but the variety carters to taste buds. I ordered 2 burgers with chicken and fries. I liked both of them. They are good size, fills you up. I would recommend this place for ppl getting a quick bite to eat or hang out with friends. All in All would recommend the place. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Different location same great food. My family has been loyal to bang bang since the beginning. We were happy to hear about the south end location, but after mapping, realized it's not much closer than the OG bang bang. 
Entering this location there was a sense of pride. Happy seeing the larger dining room. The new decor. All done very well. This business deserves a stand alone building. 
 The staff is just as lovely as the Elizabeth location. And the food is like always, great. Can't wait to come back. I will leave the owner with this one last thing. 
Bang Bang Steele Creek  
Think about it!"}
{"text":"These burgers were delicious. My co-worker has the guacamole burger with sweet potato fries and I had the weekly special which was the stuffed jalapeño burger. The guacamole burger was absolutely delicious. The stuffed jalapeño burger was good too but I wish there would have been a better description; it was basically a jalapeño popper on top of a burger. I was hoping the jalapeño was going to be stuffed/mixed in the burger patty. Besides that, we would try this place again next time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I went to bang bang bites and was disappointed. The staff was super friendly, the space was great, but the parking lot was tiny so keep that in mind. As for the food, I ordered 3 sliders: siracha, k-pop, and the pimento. They were ok, but at $15 for three and chips, the price was steep and I still felt hungry when I left. I did not get asked how I wanted my sliders cooked and they were super well done (boo!). The chips were average at best.

I heard this morning Joe is going back to his original model of no sliders. Good man to put your ego aside and kudos for trying something different and listening to the feedback of your customers.

I hope this choice is successful for you! Would possibly come back at some point."}
{"text":"Sorry to see the sliders leave, will still enjoy the larger burgers. You won't be disappointed with Bang Bang Burgers SouthEnd"}
{"text":"Excellent burgers! Best burger and value in Charlotte. Gourmet burger plus a side-- can't find that kind of deal here for a comparable value. Walked right in on a Friday night. Love it!"}
{"text":"I just heard that the bites are gone and burgers are in. I'm a big fan of bang bang burgers and have been to bang bang bites twice. The bites did need some work (cheese just wasn't melting). That said though, I really appreciate that Joe took a risk and tried something new. The concept was fun, staff was friendly, and the pimento bite was awesome. I'm personally looking forward to the TNT burger hopefully coming to south end now, but I hope this doesn't stop Joe from being innovative in the future."}
{"text":"Really like this place.... the staff is great. Cozy atmosphere. The food is delicious!!! A side from the juicy sliders the veggie bowl is on point."}
{"text":"This is more of a fast-casual type concept where you order at the register and get a table number for them to deliver your food.

They have a nice assortment of burgers for people that like all sorts of things. I went basic and got the Bang Bang Burger. All of the ingredients were fresh and the pickles nice and crisp (not warm and soggy). I'm a big fan of sauces and dips so I tried three different ones (Bang Bang, Ranch and Pesto Mayo). The Pesto Mayo is amazing! I would buy just that for my apt and put it on chicken, grilled cheese, etc. 

The Brussels sprouts were crispy but not burnt and not too salty."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money.  Way overpriced cheap almost preformed patty.  Fries were only saving grace.  Go to Pinky's, Comet, Shake Shack or even Hardee's.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I am very happy to hear the news that the owners have listened to their customers and abandoned the slider concept, and Bang Bang Bites will soon be a full-sized burger joint just like their original location instead. Can't wait to try it out again! 

(This rating reflects the Elizabeth location's menu, which is on its way to this location any day now)"}
{"text":"After learning that Bang Bang Burgers have a second location at South End last night, I managed to drag my husband and son to this joint tonight.  First of all, I love the casual decor (mix of wood & industrial).  Although this is a smallish restaurant, it has a spacious style...thanks to its high ceilings.  I definitely prefer the overall vibe here over the one at their original location.  However, it's basically the same menu as Bang Bang Burgers.  I heard that this location used to serve up Sliders, but they seemed to have discontinued them.  No matter, no complaints here.  I tried the \"K-Pop Burgers\" this time (last time, I tried their signature Bang Bang Burgers...which was the Bomb!)...and it did not disappoint.  Who knew Kimchee would go so well with a Burger??  I also tried the Sweet Potato Fries (instead of the standard Fries or the Onion Rings) this time...and that also did not disappoint.  My husband (Mushroom & Swiss Burger) and son (Cowboy Burger ) were also very happy with their burgers and fries .  In short, this burger joint is Awesome...definitely my favorite burger spot in town!  If only they'd open even a third location closer to me??"}
{"text":"Ventured here with friends when the wait at Superica was too long. Didn't really know what to expect, but when we walked in on a Sunday afternoon it wasn't too busy. I ordered the Cowboy double with the black bean patties and fries. They are served on boards with whatever your sauce is on the side. Presentation was perfect! Flavor was strong, but the black bean patties fell apart easily which made this a little messy. The mess was worth it and overall it was tasty. A couple of my friends got the Pimento burger and said it too was delicious, just heavy. I would definitely come here again, probably for lunch instead of dinner."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sad I didn't get to try the sliders before they changed out the menu. I prefer sliders to large burgers. I love Bang Bang though, so I was happy to try the new location. The burger was fantastic. I got bacon jam on top and it was really delicious. I also love the sweet potato fries and sweet sauce! 

The staff was friendly and quick. We were one of the first customers in that day and they were so efficient and helpful. It got busy pretty quickly! 

I love the new location, it's so bright and clean. I think it's my favorite compared to the two. I will most definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"We came back here after they updated to Bang Bang South End (as opposed to Bang Bang Bites). The restaurant had more patrons, the prices were more reasonable, and the food was better. They made the right move in abandoning the slider concept and switching to full burgers.

In my opinion, they don't have the best burgers in Charlotte (the Liberty and Bad Daddy's are better), but they are pretty good for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered 2 sliders and a side of sweet potato fries for dinner. When the food came out, I was worried that it would not be enough, but I was full and happy at the end of the meal! Only been open a few days and was completely packed! Hoping they add some draft beers and keep up the impressive business!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, cool interior and outside deck, but burgers were mediocre at best. Certainly not worth $10."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to this opening since the Charlotte Agenda first wrote about it. I've been to Bang Bang Burgers and love it and thought a slider option sounded awesome. We scheduled a cheat day from our diet to try it and were very disappointed. 

We got 3 slicers each: Pimiento, Sriracha, Fried Mac and Cheese, K-Pop, Blue and Bacon Jam, and Crispy Chicken. There were many problems, the biggest of which was that the meat was dry, overcooked, and flavorless. We asked for them medium rare and they came out medium well. The patties are also incredibly tiny and don't come close to filling the bun. The best ones were the ones that had enough sauce to cover up the bad tasting burger -- the Blue and Bacon Jam, the Pimento, and the K-Pop. The Crispy Chicken was by far the best. The chicken was delicious unlike the beef. The other two were so dry they were almost inedible. We got BBQ and sweet potato chips as our sides. They were both pretty good, but I liked the sweet potato more. 

The price for what you get isn't cheap either. Considering the size of the sliders, $15+ is quite a bit to pay (plus half of them have an upcharge). 

Considering that they know how to cook a normal burger at their other restaurant, I'm really hoping they are just still working out the kinks for making sliders. If I see reviews start to change, I'd give them another chance. Otherwise I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! I came here and got the black bean burger, and sweet potato fries with a maple side sauce!!! The fries were made perfectly crisp and the sauce had an incredible tangy sweet note! The burger was made to perfection and topped with a delicious layer of guacamole! They have one of those cool computer pop machines, a great reward system and excellent PERSONABLE customer service!! Southern hospitality at its best!!! Ill be here for lunch moving forward!!! Cool atmosphere ... rustic-urban feel! Bon appetite!! Excuse the photo I had already started eating! Ha!"}
{"text":"After seeing the weekly special on Facebook I couldn't help but stop in. I've been to the other location and loved it so I was definitely looking forward to this location as well.

Both my husband and I ordered the Tomatillo Guacamole Burger. I genuinely hope they add this to the regular menu because it was absolutely delicious! Grilled onion, jalapeno, and tomatillo, chopped and then mixed with avocado, cilantro, and lime juice...all over a beef patty with chorizo, pepper jack cheese, and chipotle mayo. I'm still dreaming about this burger!

We had great service and our food arrived fast since we made sure to visit after the lunch rush. I always suggest Bang Bang to friends who are looking for a great place to eat in Charlotte. Looking forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to checking the \"new guy\" in Southend... actually there are a lot of \"new guys\" and I'm falling behind very fast.

I believe the \"bites\" concept has changed so they are offering full burgers here.

They pretty much went \"all in\" with the restaurant decor.  From the ceiling fans that look like farm windmills, to the cattle fence that directs you to the registers, there's definitely no shortage of theme here.  It is definitely an interesting space with the wood and industrial chairs.  There's even a little upstairs \"nook\" with about two tables... maybe for private parties or large groups?  The group would be limited though.... from what I saw, there was a couple up there enjoying their privacy and lift view of the restaurant.

Staff was super friendly and patient as we perused the menu.  It looks like they do a good bit of take out/to go orders as well for the neighborhood.

I had the mushroom and Swiss burger and it came with a generous side of mustard.  The fries were presented in a mini frying basket and the whole thing presented on a wooden tray with handle.

You order at the register and the servers will give you a number to find you in the dining room.  

Also ordered an egg roll snack that I split with my friend.  It comes piping hot and split into two with the signature bang bang sauce.  My friends burger had fresh jalapeños on it (sriracha burger) so if you enjoy major heat, I'd recommend that one.

There are two coke machines in the back... looks like they are more compact and a little more user friendly from the \"version 1\" coke machines I'm used to seeing everywhere.

Overall it was a good dining experience.  I'm a fan of the large squirt bottles of ketchup on each table and rolls of paper towels.  There's a nice porch/deck area, however it was raining that day we visited.  Probably my one ding is parking... I guess they share parking with next door The Zepplin so it was a rainy weekday night and the lot was full.... I can't imagine this place on the weekends.  There is street parking but if you are coming in from a different neighborhood, be prepared to walk if the lot is full.  And with all the stuff coming into Tremont, I'm sure the parking situation will just become more challenging."}
{"text":"The only thing i didnt like... Them blasting Whitney Houston... Jk!!! The original is back! The owner has answered our concerns and has brought back the original bang bang flavor to southend. Getting a beer in southend? Stop here! Amazing quality burger in one of the hottest locations in the city. Bravo bang bang bravo."}
