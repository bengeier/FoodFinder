{"text":"Beautiful cozy place to relax with a snack and cup of coffee."}
{"text":"There were only two shrimp and a few measly pieces of chorizo in the spicy shrimp dish ($11) I had for lunch!  I'm not usually accused of having a big appetite, so being able to down my meal in five minutes is pitiful.  At least they gave me more bread when I asked for it, or I would have left starving."}
{"text":"This is a bizarre restaurant but I'll say the new menu is excellent. It's  small plates which are really best enjoyed shared. All the dishes we tried were lovely, flavorful, and well-seasoned. 

The rest of the experience is bizarre. Our hostess was also out \"tour-guide\", I kid you not, and didn't seat us and give us menus. Instead we got led around the entire friggin' place to view all the bizarre oddities of the place, disco ball. Eating on sofas, while crouched over a low table is just plain uncomfortable. The weirdness of the place is entertaining but just doesn't do the food justice."}
{"text":"Great new place to go on cleveland's East Side.  Opens early for coffee etc... And serves both lunch and evening small plates.  Outstanding wine list and tons of imported beers.  Cool lounge atmosphere with music on weekends."}
{"text":"The whole place smells like fish. It looks promising , but it smells like fish. I 
asked the hostess whats with the fish smell. She said it always smells like that . Well I couldn't take it and left."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. I'm not sure why people are giving it two and three stars.  The service has always been good for me.  George, Ricky, that other lady with the glasses, and the other guy (I call him the wine guy) are knowledgeable, good to talk to but not overly chatty, and quick with the drinks.  While you won't find Coors Light (or any other domestics here) the beers are well selected and give you the opportunity to step out of your beer comfort zone. You won't be disappointed.  You might even find a new favorite that is hard to find else where.  The wines are the same, primarily from Germany, Belgium, Italy, France, etc.

During the day, it is mostly the business crowd and at night a mix of a cougar patch and couples.  This has turned into one of my wife and my favorite drink spots.  

Food: A little pricey but unique and good.  My favorite are the mouth pockets.  I've had the shrimp, cheese platter, and chorizo crepes.  All good.  

Overall a winner I feel."}
{"text":"Seems they need to work out some kinks with their morning wait staff. Excited to try a new restaurant in town, I stopped in for breakfast around 8:30. Two businessmen were shaking hands in the parking lot as I was entering, so guessed the crowd would be that type. Seemed to be the case - looks like most folks were meeting over breakfast to discuss some sort of business. I was greeted with a friendly welcome and taken to a comfy table in the back. The decor at Fountain is really welcoming - you sort of feel like you're being invited into someone's home, rather than a typical restaurant setup. While the table I was sitting at was cozy (upholstered bench seats surrounding a cool coffee table with inlay), it wasn't overly conducive to eating - had to slouch over to eat. Why do I have so many comments about my seating area you ask? Because I had plenty of time to study every detail about it while I waited and waited and waited to be served. 

Overhearing a table behind me also questioning the whereabouts of a server, I decided to find someone. Thinking this place didn't operate by the typical restaurant concept of the patron being seated and waited on, I asked the (owner?) if someone would bring me a menu or if I was supposed to order something up front. He handed me a menu without any mention of someone being with me shortly - keep in mind he was the one who had seated me 10 minutes prior. 

Breakfast menu offering is sparse and European (strada, croissants, sausage & pretzel). I opted for the egg croissant. Waited another 5 minutes when a gentleman finally stopped over and started pouring me a coffee. Granted, I do drink coffee, but decaf. What I thought was odd was that he assumed I was a coffee drinker and never asked if I wanted something else to drink. After receiving my decaf, I waited another 5 minutes. By now, I was pretty frustrated with all the waiting. I occupied my time by listening to the server at the next table over fumble over what she guessed the strada of the day was - the table had several questions about the menu and you would have thought they just pulled this girl off the street; she didn't seem to know a darn thing about the place. I started packing up my stuff to head out when the (owner?) stopped over and asked if I was ready to order. Ready?? I expressed my frustration with the long wait and told him I was just about ready to leave (which I should have done). With no apology or  acknowledgement of what I had just said, he took my order. I ate my croissant (which was pretty tasty, though difficult to screw up some egg wedged in a croissant) and was on my way. My bill only included the sandwich, not the coffee. My first thought was not that they comped my coffee for feeling bad for the long wait, but that they didn't include because they had no clue what was going on.

Why the two stars and not one? The decor was nice and they have a great fountain out front. And, they serve German pretzels. I'll stop by to try one, though will probably take it to go.

Pretty bummed as I was hoping to find a reliable, non-chain place nearby to enjoy breakfast."}
{"text":"I was invited there for a Sunday private brunch. The food was amazing, different offerings, very clean, and loved the music and restrooms...I would definitely go back there again for Sunday Brunch. There was so much to choose from also from the brunch line up....from lamb to french toast & crab cakes to pancakes!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast.  Opens at 7AM, Monday through Friday and 8AM on Saturday.   Sat on the patio. Enjoyed the ambiance, coffee and a German Brezel. Ask to have it warmed.  Gracious wait-staff. Attentive Managers. Free Wi-Fi connection."}
{"text":"had lunch with a friend, there was small portions with large price, strange service too. maybe once they get the new kinks out it will be better. It was hard to fins something i even wanted to try to eat."}
{"text":"Good place to go for a drink or a cup of coffee. Great selection of beer and cocktails.  I would not go there to eat - food is good, but portions are small."}
{"text":"What can I say about Fountain? Well, I suppose I cannot say much (good) about their service, though maybe I hit it on a bad night. Let me be more specific: I hit it on a Happy Hour Meetup Group night. I went as part of the group that recent evening, and though what I ate was decent--and for a crepe with bananas, chocolate and whipped cream, really, how could it have been anything less than that? Indeed I would probably rate it as slightly better than decent. What I would rate as less than that however, was the snide commentary I received from a man who presumably was part of the restaurant staff. I had sat at a table with friends that happened to be near a couch. If one sat in one of the four chairs at the table just so, that chair would block off a pathway where one might pass through in getting from the door to the bar and rest of the restaurant. There were, of course, other pathways to get from point A (the door) to point B (the bar/rest of the restaurant). However I was the unlucky one that particular evening to have the audacity (apparently) to sit in the chair that if tilted a certain way, blocked one path to getting to the bar. I had no idea that I was blocking anything that night, however--I'd never been to the restaurant before. In any case, a man wearing a grey sweater, if memory serves me right, came up to me and scolded me in a sarcastic tone for sitting where I was and in a snobby manner, suggested I get thee up and movin' from the space my behind currently occupied. Will I be back to Fountain anytime in the next decade? If you were me, what would you do? ....That's what I thought."}
{"text":"Cute new place with a nice wine menu, tasty food, and excellent desserts. The decor is interesting. It is a good place for a casual dinner meeting."}
{"text":"As Kelly F. reported...yes. This place is a cougar palace. But let's not let that detour you. 

My mother loves this place but I knew I had to try it on my own to determine it's worthiness. And I completely agree. We walked in and were greeted with a beautifully decorated bar which then led to a cozy sitting area. Later, after a couple glasses of wine, we then found a dance room with a DJ.

Do yourself a favor if you are going to the bar. Ask for Erich. He is awesome! Picked out a perfect glass of wine and at the end of the night we felt like we knew him for years. I love a good bartender who knows what they are doing and who isn't easily annoyed at my friends asking for a \"good shot\". And I know how anyone working a bar loves that question. (sarcasm)

I will be back in the future and want to try their brunch and dinner. Stay tuned...see you soon."}
{"text":"I feel like Fountain has potential, but it's not quiiite there yet.

I met my Mom here for lunch a few weeks ago. I like the cafe/loungey atmosphere, but they totally ruin it by having a decently large sized playpen for kids near the back. Total turn-off. When I'm sipping cocktails or having fancy (and expensive) food, the last thing I want to see is a bunch of little brats playing with brightly colored toys. I guess it makes sense since they're located so close to a school and it makes it convenient for mommies to grab drinks together while their kids play together in the playpen after school, but it's pretty unappealing to me and kills the ambiance. 

We split a few small plates - the spicy shrimp, some croquettes, and some type of meatballs. The croquettes were definitely the best - although it's hard to mess up something fried and cheesy. The spicy shrimp was not at all spicy, but tasted fairly good, and the meatballs were okay, but they both came out somewhere close to room temperature. It felt like a rip-off - the prices are high and the portions are small, which would be acceptable if the food tasted great, but it really didn't.

We split a berry crepe, which was the worst part of the meal. It tasted like a pre-packaged crepe with some berries and whipped cream thrown on top. 

On the bright side, our server was good - friendly and pretty knowledgeable. My mom has been to Fountain both before and after our lunch together and said that all her other experiences were a lot better, so maybe it was just an off day? I would probably go back for breakfast or mayyybe in the early evening, but my lunch experience really wasn't what I had been hoping for."}
{"text":"Are you a cougar, divorcée, or self-proclaimed bachelor?  If so, this is your place!

The other evening, my husband and I dropped in for a drink with a friend out on Fountain's patio.  We get it - this establishment gets its name because there is a ginormous euro-style fountain smack in the middle of the patio.  Kind of pretty but also kind of gaudy (and loud, it almost sounds like it's gurgling and gasping for air). . .

The drink list is both extensive and expensive - you will certainly notice that prices are conveniently missing from the menu.  Although, I must admit, the high quality (in this particular case) justified the high price.

Slightly strange vibe (hence the mention of cougar, divorcée, or self-proclaimed bachelor) - what we referred to as \"an interesting crowd.\" 

The service definitely needs some tweaking - awkward. 

I may go back, but most likely only for the people watching and a solid drink."}
{"text":"This is the \"girliest\" menu that I have ever seen. The quality of the food is very good. The chef is first rate. We have loved her food at previous places. The drink prices are very fair (for Chagrin Blvd). However, this is not a place for (most) any man to eat. I really wish that it was a little less expensive and a little more varied. I live very close by and at this point would only go back to drink. I could easily eat $75-$100 worth of food there on my own. By the way, the outdoor fountain is way too big for that size patio."}
{"text":"Went for lunch late Friday afternoon and sat at the patio.  Pretty, but it took 45 minutes to get 3 sandwiches and it's not like it was crowded.  My daughter wanted a vanilla milkshake but they had no vanilla ice cream. The quality of the food was good but portions were small for the price.  Even if a restaurant is new they need to have their act together from the start.  Not planning to rush back there."}
{"text":"The food in this place is awesome! Really relaxed but still classy atmosphere. Nice fountain outside on the patio in the warmer months with really quaint outdoor seating.

Sampled a number of things on the menu and particularly enjoyed the chorizo crepe. They also have an impressive selection of beer and wine and well versed servers that can help you decide what will be best for your preferences. 

Will be headed there next time i'm in town for a visit!"}
