{"text":"Classic Tiki decor, the premium liquor makes the drink prices sooooo worth it. You would think that you are on a mini vacation. Friendly and happy staff with good energy and vibe. Nothing to complain about this place. Will return anytime."}
{"text":"Le drink était bon, mais plus que la moitié du verre était de la glace! Vraiment décevant pour un drink à 15$! Je vous ne le recommande pas!"}
{"text":"Good decorations inside and the cocktails were great , will definitely be back ..
cool place."}
{"text":"We were only able to eat outside because we had kids, so we opted for drinks and an app.

First, I love tiki culture. I search for tiki bars wherever we go. I spotted this place, but was skeptical because you don't think Tiki in Canada. These guys know their tiki and the decor is perfect.

The drinks-I had a painkiller and the husband had the fog cutter. Both were spot on and STRONG! Truly hold their own with some of our top tiki spots.

The app-fries. The aioli was perfect!

Service was also really good!"}
{"text":"Vraiment un nice spot pour boire des cocktails! Ils assument l'ambiance Tiki au maximum et c'est vraiment cool ! 

Les cocktails sont souvent a base d'excellent rhum et ils sont toujours très bien servis ! Nous n'avons pas mangé a cette endroit, mais je peux vous dire que les cocktails en valent le déplacement ! 

Bref, cest un beau petit spot !"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting from NY and our friend wanted to try this place out and I'm so glad we did!  It was my boyfriends birthday and we came without a reservation to sit at the bar - Samuel helped us find seating at the bar and made sure we were taken care of.  This restaurant knows how to do business and keep customers coming back.  

We tried a few things from the menu and they were delicious - from the fries to the rangoon and this chicken/rice dish inside a pineapple - everything was delicious. 

I can't wait to come back!  I love feeling valued as a customer."}
{"text":"Comment parler de mon \"expérience\"au Tiki Bar...une grosse catastrophe?!!!!!!! 
Ayant eu vent du succès de l'établissement, j'ai eu la présence d'esprit de réserver une table avant de m'y présenter! 
Lorsque nous sommes arrivées, nous avons été accueillis par une serveuse qui nous a conduit vers notre table...au milieu de la salle...et surtout complètement dans le passage vers le bar,et les cuisines! 
Dans la salle les chanceux et ceux qui arrivent à 4 ou plus ont le droit à une alcôve avec banquette et confort ou une grande table et nous nous avons eu le droit à une demi table étroite avec tabourets hauts!
On a clairement l'impression qu'ils ont essayé de caser le maximum de tables possibles dans un minimum de place...
Pour la petite histoire j'étais avec ma maman qui est assez petite et pour qui monter sur un tabouret revient à gravir l'Everest...Bref nous avons demandé  à cette même serveuse si il était possible de changer de table et celle-ci nous a gratifié d'une réponse négative agrémentée d'un ton plus que désagréable et condescendant! 
Effectivement l'expérience de cette table s'est révélée quelque peu périlleuse....les plats ont du mal à tenir dessus, il ne faut pas manger avec les coudes trop éloignés du corps, sous peine d'être bouscule toutes les 3 secondes....
À cela, il faut ajouter un service très long et une musique d'ambiance qui prend le dessus sur toutes les conversations!
Mais j'ai quand même quelques notes positives à souligner.....l'autre serveuse en salle était gentille et pétillante et il ne faut pas leur enlever le fait que la cuisine est originale et goûteuse et qu'ils demeurent une référence pour les cocktails! 
Enfin les prix sont clairement dispendieux et pour une telle gamme de prix je m'attendais à des plats un peu plus généreux et surtout à un service de qualité.."}
{"text":"Les cocktails et l'ambiance valent bien le coût mais la nourriture offre un TRÈS mauvais rapport qualité-prix. Ils veulent un peu imiter les menus et prix type d'Agrikol ou ex Bethléem XXX mais c'est à peine comestible pas très frais et super cher. Bref pour boire quelques verres c'est parfait mais pour la bouffe faut revoir le prix à la baisse ou engager quelqu'un pour refaire un menu à la hauteur."}
{"text":"An attractive tiki themed bar with fab velvet paintings and cool lighting fixtures. 

It's too bad this place is very style over substance. Cocktails and food were uneven and overpriced. My \"baby back ribs\" starter was 4 sad, grey, gamey tasting / low quality mostly unseasonsed ribs served on a cup of rice. Coconut cocktail was ok, but Fog Cutter in no way resembled a fog cutter and was pretty much undrinkable. At these prices the cocktails should be special, but even at their height none bring the excitement they should."}
{"text":"Super cute tiki bar in little Italy. The drinks are great and the decor is fabulous (they even have some relics from old closed down tiki bars in Montréal). The drinks are a bit pricey but the generally tend to be at tiki bars. The best part? The staff. Super attentive and helpful. It's a great addition to the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"Went to check out the newly opened snowbird tiki bar in Little Italy with a group of friends and have to say they did a great job with the decor. You can't even tell that this was the old cafe international location. The food on the other hand was so-so at best...nothing to write home about. We sampled a few dishes and were not impressed. The drinks on the other hand were good. Would definately recommend this place if you are looking for a place to grab a few drinks with friends but would skip food."}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying. The drinks are great. Not overpriced for what goes into them. Standard prices for a tiki bar. And I've been to my share of tiki bars aroind the world. 
The part where this bar takes a real nose dive is the service. 
Now if you want to staff your bar with a bunch of kids that look the young part and try to attract a mile end crowd that's your choice, but make sure they actually work. This ain't a kindergartens man! We waited up to 45 minutes for our second drinks, to come  and we were a large group of people that had wallets thirsty to spill out. I can understand the time it takes to make drinks but when two of the three bar staff are just dicking around the back of the bar dancing, looking around like a deer in headlights and just goofing off when these are the people you placed your orders with 40 minutes ago... Then you complain to what looks to be the bar manager and he just brushes you off... well. Get your shit together. 
This could be a great bar, if they hired bar tending professionals and not bun wearing hipsters that think they're hanging out instead of working. 

In the end we ordered half the drinks we would have and stay late. So, it's just bad business."}
{"text":"I've only been here for drinks, and though tiki drinks are typically too sweet for me, I found lovely bitter libations I loved here and had tons of fun. I like the chill yet festive decor, they really did a good job with the nautical vibe, and it was a pleasure to sit here with the front wide open watching the people roll by during a street fest in the summer. I think it'll be even better in the winter when it's cozy and tropical inside and an ice storm dystopia outside. Ah, Quebec, je t'aime."}
{"text":"Les drinks sont très bons (mon goût à moi), pas trop sucrés! Ils sont faits avec du rhum pour la plupart et ça permet de goûter de nouveaux produits! 

Sinon, je n'ai pas mangé, mais ce n'est pas donné! Idéal pour un 5@7!!!"}
{"text":"Un peu d'exotisme à Montréal!
Nous nous sommes laissés tenter par plusieurs cocktails, tous excellents! Les saveurs sont variées et parfois originales avec des alcools importées dont vous pouvez demander la provenance et la composition au serveur, qui est un gars très cool.
Idéal pour un 5à7 car il n'y a pas beaucoup de monde.
Un décor de rêve au goût rhum coco, c'est délicieux!"}
{"text":"Andy's the man! Hooked it up with delicious drinks. The cocomo, pineapple express, and mai thai were excellent. Didn't care much for the pain killer. We also got the blue lagoon-- the set recipe isn't too good, but Andy modified it a little for us and then it was perfect."}
{"text":"Ok well let me mention how excited I was to try this place out ever since it was Re-Opened. I love tropical drinks and have them all the time when I'm on vacation or during the summer. 

their opening day was a Monday .. I found it super odd and if I didnt know it was the old cafe international I would have totally missed the place. There's no signof their name .. its so dimmed and not a smart move. It Was Dead ...On opening day.. that's a bad sign.

I decided to come here saturday night to see if it was any different. On saturday, I came in to try it out and see their menu. They were not dead but not busy at all. There was no body at the bar.. and maybe 2 other groups. 
It made me freak out! That's sad! I checked the menu and wanted the \"cocomono\" they didn't have it..
Actually 3 drinks on the menu were unavailable due to missing ingredients. Lolol you guys took months to open up and you just opened and you're missing the ingredients.. terrible service, quality and fake publicity.

The drinks were ok but not superbe. My fiancé complained how his drink was super strong. Aparently they are wasting 3ounces of rum per drink ( a small 1 cup) eesh that's super excessive ! Not really impressed 

Service was mediocre , the place was mediocre and no signs of the new tikki bar .. so disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I have visited many of the classic Tiki bars in the US and Canada. 

If I could rate this place on decor only.... it would get 3 stars. But on everything else, it gets a 1.

The drinks are overpriced and average. The service is mediocre.  

If you are looking for an authentic Tiki bar experience in Montreal.... you are out of luck."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great cocktails, this is the place to go! After a long hot day, I was much in need of something cold and refreshing. My friend and I finally decided to give this new place a shot. I'm not a big fan of sweet cocktails, but the one I ordered, the Bird's Park Swizzle and my friend's, the Curious Diver, were both AMAZING, tasted so fresh, with good quality ingredients and not overly sweetened. We were both very pleased with our drink.

It was not too packed on a Saturday around midnight. The decor is fun and inviting. I would have given this place a better rating if the music was better...even our server commented on it. It is probably not always like that so I would have to give it another chance and also try the food. Kitchen closes at midnight, so arrive early if you are going to eat!"}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere is great and I see what they are trying to do here but the service is terrible. We waited over 40 minutes for a drink.  I was served only two drinks in the span of three hours. When we complained and went to ask where our drinks were we were met with a negative attitude like we were the ones being rude. It's too bad because this bar has potential but my experience there makes me not want to go back. Total turn off."}
{"text":"Accidentally stumbled upon this place while walking around Little Italy, the decor is so funky and cool that we couldn't resist going inside to check it out! We only ordered drinks so no clue how the food tastes, but the cocktails are excellent! I had some sort of mango/pineapple rum thing that tasted fantastic, and the glass was pretty full and big too. My partner had a mai tai that she says was great. A bit pricey (14$+ per cocktail minimum) but still worthwhile to check out. They have a smoke machine in the bar too, and the table next to us got some sort of drink that was literally on fire. Will have to try that next time..."}
