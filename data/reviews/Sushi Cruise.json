{"text":"This place is great, loved the sushi rolls and they even have ramen perfect craving size. We will definitely be coming back again. Service is great and everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"This place has amazing service, delicious food,  and wonderful sushi chefs! Price is comparable to other AYCE. The reason I like this place so much is because if you talk to the sushi chefs, they'll make something special for you and even name a roll after you! Talk about going the extra mile!"}
{"text":"Absolute non-stop deliciousness. I wanted to eat everything on the menu but of course it was impossible cuz there was so many selections. The the place was full to capacity and yet as busy as the wait staff was they got the food out fast and stay cool calm and collected the whole time. My table was checked on several wait staff while I was dining. They were all extremely friendly and hospitable. I wish there was a way to give the more than five stars however they get all five stars in this rating system. This is a method of feasting that I am so happy we have on this planet. It was like being in the Garden of Eating."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, staff is friendly, this could be my new go to sushi spot. I really like it here. Try the: Screaming O salad and the Angus roll. All of the sashimi is great, very fresh. Nigiri is great. Loved all the rolls. They even do half rolls. Give them a try, super nice spot"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The fish was so fresh. The rolls were delicious. The service was outstanding. I loved it. And so darn inexpensive! Wow, what a good place. I loved watching the sushi chefs at work. They were full of good cheer and laughter!"}
{"text":"Really impressed. Very accommodating for the gluten free diet. Definitely the best veggie roll I have ever had. Everything was fresh, service was fast and attentive and prices are reasonable. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"YAASSSS! Be sure to try the baby octopus, so good! Great service and quality food. Baked green mussels were great as well."}
{"text":"Sushi Cruise has been great so far I live down the block and Order carry out maybe once a week they always tend to throw in a free roll which is definitely appreciated fish is great quality seems great flavors good not too much mayonnaise or sauce on their roles I recommend you try it I've been in for all you can eat and they do a great job of taking care of you what more can I say."}
{"text":"Just happened to be driving by. Will definitely be back! By far the biggest variety of rolls and other menu items than many other all you can eat sushi places I've been to. Price is on par with other all you can eat sushi places I've been to, but for the options you have, the price is more than fair. Definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"It's was the perfect place to eat after a long weekend at edc shout out to Jamie for being a dope sever! So good we went twice in a week. Ariel was amazing too! Best experience"}
{"text":"We start with a new special price for lunch 12:00 pm to 3:00pm $19.95 and after 3:00pm to 12am dinner price $24.95 (monday to sunday), we have new items so delicious come and taste it yummi yummi"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and made with love! I've been here twice. I love the crab pockets, stuffed jalape√±os, and golden spoon for appetizers. And all of the rolls have been great. Plus, they allow you to order half rolls so you can try more. :)) No complaints here! I will have to post more pictures in the future. It gets eaten too quickly! Haha."}
{"text":"This place was super good, service was excellent and the ambiance was just right! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This place is the best! My boyfriend and I have already gone 5 times and it's only been open for 3 weeks. The fish is super fresh, appetizers are amazing and the customer service is great and the chef's are super nice. The owner came by and checked on us a bunch of different times. It already replaced our previous sushi spot which was Goyemon. This place completely beats it. Thank you so much for your excellent customer service and great food! (:"}
{"text":"Service was amazing & the sushi was delicious!  The shrimp tempura & baked rolls were on point! Prices were just like any other All You Can Eat Sushi place but this one is by far my favorite. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place definitely AYCE the sushi!   Pricing: It's pretty similar to all the other AYCE sushi places.   Location: It is hidden. Not in the greatest area since it is being covered by a bar, i believe? Asides from that, they are pretty much against Gorilla Sushi since it is down the street.   Service: They were welcoming and nice. They checked up on us often for any additional orders. Refilled our waters. Overall, very attentive with our table.   Food: PROBABLY THE BEST AYCE SUSHI PLACE EVER. I loved every bite of what i ordered. They tasted great and different. Their appetizers were amazing. The list is long. Try the oyster shooter, calamari, monkey ball, mushroom cap and miso soup. You won't be disappointed. The oyster shooters was bomb! It was citrusy and refreshing.  The calamari was crispy af. Dip it with the sauce it comes and it brings you heaven. Now the monkey ball and mushroom cap were similar. Monkey ball is just spicy and fried. I loved both! Then the miso soup wasn't so salty like the others.  Asides from the appetizers, I definitely enjoyed their Golden Philly and their Baked Lobsters.  They were both rich with flavor. I feel like their sauces are different. I've never tasted a few of the sauces that were topped with my sushi at other sushi places.    Dessert wise: Try their fried ice cream. It was good. Crispy and fruity pebble liked. Some fried ice cream taste like canola oil. Not this one.  Last but not least: VISIT ON APRIL 20th for 9.95 AYCE sushi. How could you not attend that special day deal!?"}
{"text":"the best service of las vegas, friendly servers, good food, nice place  you need to try AYCE, they have sake  japanese beer , dessert  and more!!!!"}
{"text":"Very satisfied with our AYCE dinner. The variety of food is legitness. If you are looking for a new AYCE sushi place, come here!"}
{"text":"Was there today for the $9.95 AYCE Grand Opening, TOTAL DISASTER when I arrived people waiting to be seated NO hostess to take guest name and how many in there group. Waiters and Waitressess ignore me when I asked how long the wait is. Sushi Cruise should have been better prepared for this. I was told before the place was was to open at 11:30am there were people already waiting. Someone at least would gone out and get there names and how many in the group. There are plenty of AYCE Sushi in Las Vegas and I won't be wasting my time at Sushi Cruise and I let everbody else know to spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place was great. Each dish felt unique and flavorful. The yuzu yellow tail nigiri is a must. They put the yuzu under the fish so the rice soaks it up and makes for a delightful, citrus explosion. The samon skin was cut thick leaving some meat which I really enjoy. The flavors of each sauce and fish pairing was taken into carefull consideration to leave a lasting impression. To top off a wonderful meal,  our server, Yennie, provide beyond superb customer service."}
{"text":"Growing up in this town I have eaten a lot of sushi throughout my many years hands down I had a very excellent experience and wonderful food and above all great service I can't wait to come back again"}
{"text":"It was pretty slow when we got there at 7:00pm, about four tables taken.  As it was slow the service was pretty on point, but once a few more people came in our server seemed all over the place. We had put in an order for 4 different half rolls, 2 came out in about 5 minutes.  And after waiting for about 15 minutes I had asked our server about the other 2 rolls, she said it should be coming out, but apparently they lost our paper with the order on it.  Also some of our order was being served to the wrong table.  With that being said, since they've only been open for a month I guess they are still trying to get a hang of things.  In time, hopefully their service and organization will improve.  Otherwise the food was good. Prices were comparable to other AYCE sushi places.    I'll be visiting/revisiting other AYCE spots before coming back to cruise sushi."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise! Fantastic sushi and great service. Was driving through and found this place almost by accident. Cannot beat the price for lunch (or dinner) and the speed at which the food came out and the overall quality was amazing. Wish this was in my hometown!"}
{"text":"We did all you can eat and I really enjoyed it ! Some of my favorites were the shrimp tempura and the popcorn lobster roll. I love the way their menu is set up, and it organizes the different rolls really well! I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this Sushi bar when it was Tropicana Sushi, maybe 12 years ago?  The decor in the new place is fresh, and new. I went on a Wednesday, and I was the only one eating lunch. Once they noticed I was there...they were very attentive, and nice. I ordered the A.Y.C.E. Sushi. Started with my go to.. which was a spicey tuna roll. It was very fresh, and delicious. I ordered 3 other rolls.. I'm not crazy about their garlic sauce/ponzu, but the fish was delicious, and very fresh. I usually order very traditional sushi so not having a roll with ponzu sauce doesnt bother me. I will definitely be back to try different menu items. Hope the restaurant does well. I love a great sushi bar in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Seriously, where did all these 5 stars came from? Owner's friend? Family? They ate for free?  When I saw the menu it looked familiar. They have another store call Sushi 21 or something... This is when I had the \"oh crap\" moment..  Didn't have good memory from Sushi 21 and Sushi Cruise is the same. Fish on the nigiri is like frozen, defros,  frozen and defrost again. Soft, soggy fishes....  Hot food is like frozen, defrost and reheat.... I think that's pretty much sums up the food quality."}
{"text":"This place is delicious with great people to befriend that provide great service. I sat at the bar last time and the Chef is a great guy!"}
{"text":"New Yummy Sushi Place in Town...Guess what ! They have special price for the Grand Opening, Going on NOW!!!"}
{"text":"I like to come here because the fish is really fresh and the food is very fast, they have around 100 sushi rolls to choose, is awesome! They have some speacial, cupons and the best price for AYCE, I love this sushi, the best of las vegas!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Amazing food. Fast service and very friendly. Only been open 3 months. All you can eat for $15."}
{"text":"Delicious! Was our favorite place then it closed for a while and reopened with new owner... have to say might be even better now!  We are picky with our sushi and everything was delicious and fresh. They even had the Golden Knights game on"}
{"text":"Visited Las Vegas for a convention.  Really didnt feel like waiting in line at some restaurants so i drove around and saw this place had just opened a few days ago.  Tried to do some research on yelp and they weren't even listed.  This place was quiet, but the food was extraordinarily for an All You Can Eat.  Service was excellent and very attentive.  Finally posting a review since my phone had died that night.  I feel this place will be packed soon after word gets around."}
{"text":"I wish I could go in the negative. Seriously it was catastrophically horrendous. I've tried oh, 30-40 sushi places across the valley. I've even eaten at this location multiple times before when it was under the previous 2 owners. Sushi on Trop was a 3/5 Tomo was a 4/5. This place is maybe a -16/5. Where to begin. First off admittedly, I am embarrassed to have brought my mother and girlfriend here. Utterly humiliated. We walk in, and are met by a waitress who I am going to assume had never waited tables before in her life. Tripped over her own feet showing us to the table (nervous I can understand) She stuttered through their specials (I saw her eyes dart to the menu board she hadn't even memorized them) and when she was taking our orders, anything more than 2 items was met with, \"hold on please, I'm still writing\" My mother took this as rude but I am banking on inexperience. The waitress multiple times had to pause, take the paper to the chef, and get a second piece of paper to continue taking orders. We ordered maybe 4-5 things at a time, over 3 people I don't think that's too much. Seriously, get a real notepad and learn shorthand. I won't rag on her all day, just hope she is a quick study. On to the food, besides the fish having a poor smell (anyone who knows fish knows if there's any smell at all the fish is bad) We ordered a scallop nigiri, we were delivered a nigiri with a scoop of imitation crab and maybe 2 scallops thrown on top as if to hide it. Like oh don't worry we're only eating it, we won't know what's inside.... They also drenched (read flooded) everything in far too much vinegar. If you've made sushi before, you know that to make sushi rice the right stickiness you need a special sushi vinegar. The correct amount is approximately 1/2 cup of vinegar per 3 cups of uncooked rice. I think someone was a bit dyslexic and used 3 cups of vinegar for 1/2 cup of rice. I wish I was joking, but it was that bad. 2 things I noticed that had nothing to do with the food that I despised. First, while we were there, someone had apparently ordered for delivery via ubereats. now I will say 1 thing about the waitress, when we arrived, 2 white people and 1 asian person, she was  very polite and all smiles, \"Hi! How many? Can I get you a table?\". The uber driver walks in, happens to be black, and before he can say anything is met with, \"Uh, can we help you??\" in a FAR from polite tone. I found that to be incredibly unprofessional and downright BS. As if that wasn't enough, another gentleman came in and sat at the bar, and while he was treated nicely(as he was asian) there were two men outside whom we saw going from car to car trying to open people's doors. We notified the staff, made sure our door was locked, and nobody cared. Then when the guy at the bar noticed his car alarm going off, we heard the chef directly tell him oh, sometimes people drive by with loud music, the speakers probably set off your alarm. WTF?!? I had to go tell the guy flat out it wasn't some speaker bs, people are out there trying doors and you better make sure your car is locked and windows are up. I don't know if the staff were in on it or just plain didn't give a sh$%^ about what happened to anyone there. Not only will I never return, but I absolutely recommend keeping many miles between you and this place. -16/5 might be too generous!"}
{"text":"Went in for their grand opening special of $9.95 AYCE on 4/21/18. Arrived opening time, got seated promptly. Started with appetizers crab pockets (crab rangoon) and shrimp tempura. Taste as usual.   Next onto our main course of AYCE sushi. Ordered 4 different types of nigiri and 5 different half orders of sushi. Waited 30 mins to an hour and we only got one sushi order out if all that we ordered. Other people who came in minutes after us were getting there order nonstop and we had nothing at all but one plate.   I made a complaint and asked another waiter what the heck was going on, we haven't received nothing. Our waiter did not even bother to check up on us at all. Multiple waiters were taking orders and so confused as to what table those orders be delivered. Guests next to us were also waiting, so ridiculous! A different waiter went ahead to retake our order and we lost total patience, waited and waited more. So we decided to not support a penny and we took our business elsewhere. Never have I experienced such horrible, and unorganized Japanese AYCE sushi in Vegas. Sushi cruise was overhyped with their grand opening special. I have decided to continue eating at my fave AYCE sushi over on Spring Mtn. as they are better with their prompt customer service, and presentable quality of food.    This same day I also shared this special they had going on to friends and fam but immediately told them not to come after our horrible experience.   To further a successful outcome with your business, you must get organized and be professional with your guests. I've been a waitress before and matter of fact we all are customers... who wants to wait almost an hour for AYCE sushi order? Menu specifies 90 min eating limit also. Does not make sense. You will not get your money's worth here at all folks! Be advised to go elsewhere! It is not at all possible to rate with no stars so the 1 star rating ain't true. This business deserves no star."}
{"text":"Am a Sushi Lover I eat at Sarkana Yama and many other places,here at Sushi Cruise the food is excellent you will loved the Eal Sauce is made from scratch delicious very very good believe me,the Bake Salmon Roll OMG !! that one was Delicious,my personal opinion this place really is a five star I have to said everyone have a smile in the face here, very friendly Staff, Service incredible Good  and Fast,my new Sushi place I Loved is here At Sushi Cruise"}
{"text":"Great food, the selection of all you can eat menu is really big! And rolls came out fast! Coming back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"I stumble upon Sushi cruise for their Friday/Saturday special, it was my best sushi experience ever.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!! If you are around this area, then must try!   Pros: -Huge selection -Very fast/friendly service -Fresh Sushi -Clean environment  -Sushi Chef are interactive   Cons: -None! Everything perfect! -Too much ice cream, getting me fat! LOL"}
{"text":"So we went today for the grand opening and $9.95 all you can eat sushi. The food was okay, no real complaints as some of the dishes like the dynamite and lobster crunch roll were delicious.   I find with most sushi places it's about the nigri, the cut and preparation in which Sushi Cruise was good but not outstanding or close to the best I've ever had.  The service is not why I plan on visiting Sushi Cruise again. I understand a marketing and grand opening can be used as a stress test and exposure but what we saw were definite areas for improvement."}
{"text":"By far the best new sushi spot on the eastside! The rock and roll was an excellent choice for a no rice option! The oyster shooters were amazing. Garlic tuna met expectations (kinda my baseline). Excellent. Really enjoyed the super white tuna as well. They have decent selection of sake and soju. We like new things and the grapefruit soju didnt disappoint! I highly recommend stopping in!"}
