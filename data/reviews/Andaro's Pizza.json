{"text":"We really like their meat lover's pizza and it's convenient to pick up! Delivery is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Good choices. Best local pizza on the west side. No dining room though, takeout only."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Andaro's many times over the past few years and are always pleased. In particular, we thoroughly enjoy the veggie pizza. It's very high quality, and tastes superb. The staff are always happy and smiling, and give the best service. We'll always be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered from here a couple days ago & we ordered there meat lovers and a toco pizza we ended up walking to go get it from are house a block away cuz it took forever & what they gave us was two toco pizza witch we discovered when we got home also my first & last bite had a larger chunk of broken plastics in it happy to never order from there again"}
{"text":"My wife and I are addicted to the Double Cheeseburger... Pickles on pizza... Who knew!?   The staff is always super friendly and the pizza is delicious. It's a little more expensive, but the pizzas are a little more imaginative than the ordinary fare. Delivery can take a while, but just plan ahead, it's worth it."}
{"text":"The Chicken Deluxe was probably a 7.5-8/10 which isn't bad at all for pizza. However, I found the high prices to be unreasonable and to be honest they brought down the overall experience. I wanted to try something new for pizza but regretted not settling for pizza 73 or panago which would've been nearly the same and quite cheaper"}
{"text":"I love Andaro's - I had a meh experience years ago but thought I should update it as I've found the pizza since then to be consistently awesome and the service great. My only ask - could you start offering east coast donair sauce as a dipping sauce? I'd gladly pay a few bucks extra for that!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  On multiple occasions I have ordered in advance and asked for it to be ready at a specific time.  Order was accurate and ready for pickup exactly as requested.  Quality is awesome - we have had it a few times when guests were over and they comment on the great pizza and ask where it is from.  The owner/staff are really friendly, I usually end up asking \"how much pizza do I need for X adults and Y kids\" and he is always right on with his estimates.  Support local - even if it is a few dollars more expensive than a chain, this is money well spent on quality ingredients and good service."}
