{"text":"We went on a Saturday evening & there wasn't a wait, so we were a little concerned...but walking through to be seated the customers food looked delicious. Also, the new decor is lovely. Very fresh & modern. We ordered a craft beer after the waitress offered samples & brought us each 2 to try. Great beer selection. I got the shrimp & grits & a salad (it also comes with a side! Too full to eat it all, boxed it to go) The food was AMAZING! Get the shrimp & grits...you won't be disappointed.  The portions are very generous. My husband got the chicken breast & jalapeño bottle caps. He said the chicken was moist & full of flavor & we love jalapeños, so the bottle caps were a great side. Their cheesecake was on special for $2 off so we got the pumpkin flavor to go. It was so creamy & yummy! I hope this new owner stays consistent. The staff was very friendly & the service was prompt. Definitely returning soon!"}
{"text":"Hoping the best for this establishment for sure.  I have been here twice.  First time, came by myself to try out dinner and the beer list.  Had the buffalo burger with fries, cheesecake for dessert and tested the beer list.  Other than service being a little slow, the food was great.  And as a plus, the musician playing that night was outstanding!  Staff was very friendly too.    Next, I brought my wife and another couple for the Sunday breakfast.   Our waiter was very pleasant.  Menu prices are very reasonable.  We all tried something different, and everyone's food was enjoyed.  They got a couple of our orders wrong, but happily corrected things, and the manager even came out and apologized....you can't ask for much more than that.  Again, food to table time was pretty slow...hopefully they will get the bugs worked out of their systems.  Getting out from the previous owners reputation can be a big hurdle, especially with so many options out there.      I sincerely hope they can make this a fine tuned machine, the area needs more places like this"}
{"text":"Great food, perfect service. Long list of excellent beers on tap. Really glad we came!"}
{"text":"I'm fairly certain this restaurant space is cursed. Menu is very small with not much variety, craft beers on tap were all skunked and soda flat. The service wasn't the greatest and on top of that the atmosphere was the absolute strangest with YouTube karaoke that dampened the appetite. We couldn't get out of there fast enough."}
{"text":"I had noticed Copper Bar & Grill from the road in the past and thought about visiting it.  My wife and I decided to visit it one night.  Well, I am overall disappointed in Copper Bar & Grill.  The food is the reason I am giving it two stars and not one.  It was decent but not great.  However, the service was extremely lacking - and there was only one other occupied table in the place.  The atmosphere is also odd.  It is very modern looking with curtains and bright looking.  For a bar & grill, I was not expecting the setup which I understand was recently remodeled.  It was not in the right direction.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good food and appetizers.  Not sure when it will be officially completed, but they just installed a huge outdoor awning that covers the whole wrap around outside patio area.  This will be awesome for summer nights!!"}
{"text":"Tyler the waitress was outstanding!!! Since the ownership change this place is much better. The food came out wrong but Tyler was VERY quick to notice the mistake and quickly had it fixed."}
{"text":"After a 620 mile drive, we checked into a nearby hotel. We asked the front desk clerk where is a good place to eat. She recommended the Copper Bar & Grill. We pulled up around 6pm. There were just 2 other couples in the restaurant. We were seated quickly by a very friendly hostess. We took our time looking the menu over. Prices are very reasonable. My wife has pasta and their applewood pecan bacon salad. I had the steak burrito with chips and salsa. The meal was fantastic! The flavors in the salad was awesome. The burrito was filling. This place is gem and the people of Charlotte need to check this place out. I'm NOT related to anyone associated with this restaurant! We are in town for a week and will be back at least 2 more times."}
{"text":"This place really does have great food, nice staff, great location, and cool atmosphere. The burgers are really good and their sweet potato fries are some of the best that I've had. I truly have enjoyed every time I've eaten there and I definitely plan on returning"}
{"text":"On the recommendation of the bartender at Commoners Brewing up the sidewalk and another Yelper, against my better judgement, we went to this establishment tonight.   Why against my better judgment you ask?  This is the old Copper Ale House.    The Copper Ale House was that bad, I Yelped it a one star, if I could have gone lower, I would of.   Just that bad.......   Total disaster....... So, going into the place under new ownership, I had zero expectations, actually I was fearing the worse.    Excited to report, 5 star.  Me likey!!!!   Total shock.   I took some pics.   My wife and I went with the Bacon Mac n Guida Cheese burger.   So my breakdown of this burg is as follows:  1.  Bun.  Yes you can f up a bun, in their case, they had a fresh, lightly toasted and very tasty brioche bun.  It is not thick, which I prefer, but it is not to thin.  FYI - I usually take the buns off my burgers because the nasty ass Sysco buns are too thick and no taste.  2. Guida cheese.  Light and mild cheese flavor, they serve it with shells (I think), it was so creamy, I could not tell.   It was around a 7 on my mac n cheese scale.  3.  Burger patty.   Pretty sure it is not hand packed, but it was good.  Perfectly cooked with lots of flavor, very little juices, which in my opinion is a better patty.  4.  Kind of surprising, but made me happy ---- \"Everything is better with Bacon\" ----- there bacon is on the upper end of bacon.  About a 9 on my baconator scale.   It always amazes me that some restaraunts overlook bacon and serve just average bacon.   I can stay home and have average bacon form Harris Teeter, thank you very much.   Good job on going with a higher end bacon.  I want to mention the fries are beer battered and extra crispy, yum.   The Jalapeño chips are pretty decent, order the spicy ranch dip for a kick.   The spicy cheese curds are a MUST.   I love me some cheese curd.   Service in the bar area was excellent, the manager came over and asked how it was going.     Overall, we had an excellent rebound experience.  I really hope people will give them a second chance, the spot in combination of Commoners up the sidewalk would be a great weekend hang out."}
{"text":"I ate here the first weekend they were open and thought it was marginally better than the old one. I figured I would try it again later to make a final judgement. Unfortunately, the food just isn't good.   The bartender friendly and attentive. My food came out quickly and just like I ordered. It looked good and tasted bad. My main was the beer-cheese and onion hotdog. It had very little flavor and the hotdog was cold. Two came with the order, but I could only stomach one. My side was the tater-tot poutine, and it wasn't much better."}
{"text":"Good beers on tap but my fiancé and I both got there food and it had no flavor at all. Very disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! They've got good food, a great atmosphere, and I loved the Sunday brunch (with french toast!). You definitely need to check this place (and their creamsicle float) out!"}
{"text":"We dropped in for a quick lunch on a Wed around 12:45. No waiting. Very friendly staff. Ordered the bacon cheese fries - great-tasted & looked like beer battered fries with grated cheese and crumbled bacon; ordered a bbq chicken sandwich with onion petals-not greasy and chicken was flavorful; ordered a bowl of broccoli cheese soup-fantastic, stringy cheese in every bite with great balance of broccoli. We will definitely eat here again and when our beer-loving friends come into town, we will bring them. Great new choice for lunch. BTW, service was quick."}
{"text":"Great hand made burgers - the Mac and cheese burger is particularly awesome.  Good beer selection and friendly staff.  Will definitely be back,"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for new ownership.  The place is excellent. Great food at a good prices.  Interesting entrees and burgers. Monster craft beer selection. Looks like the 'new place' kinks have been ironed out. The manager is always adding to the menu with interesting ideas. Its evident that the wait staff enjoys their job; prompt and courteous service.  A new heated party tent has been added-a cool vibe.  Live music is also very good. I hope those that did not have a great experience when the place was establishing its footing try it again."}
{"text":"Great environment. Local craft beer list on tap was awesome. Service was super friendly. We got wings which were very good as our app which was 50% off for grand opening. Kids menu available. My wife and I both had burgers which were very tasty. Very good lunch menu overall and very good prices. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"When we went in for lunch there were a lot of younger staff there. They were sitting by the entry together in a group talking really loud and goofing off on their phones and things. It was pretty rude and distracting. We never received drink refills or any check ins from the staff. The food left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to restaurant in the area and for good reason-We will start with the decor which is very clean and modern; reminds me of some of the restaurants I have been to in NYC. One side is the main dining room and the other side is a fantastic bar area to watch the big game (Large TV's all over). The staff is very courteous and it is clear they truly care about your dining experience...The back of the house is effectively ran as ticket times are never an issue and the food comes out consistent every time-and that's where Copper really shines; the food quality is top notch. Where else in Concord can you get Scottish salmon that tastes like butter and a killer ribeye with a rosemary and garlic homemade compound butter? Or we could talk about the shrimp and grits that I would put up against anyone in Charleston-still not your thing? Well how about their signature Gouda mac n cheese with chicken cutlets? Vegan? Ok, Copper has a gluten free vegetable based beef patty that u would swear is meat...they even have an individually wrapped gluten friendly bun at no extra charge if u request it! They even have floats for dessert! (I am actually guilty of trying their pumpkin cheesecake too which is amazing) I've typed enough, just go check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I am giving them props! After a terrible,awful experience under previous ownership, I say yes. You all can come back. Sit on the bar side for more ambiance and socializing! Gouda Man N Cheese is da bomb!"}
{"text":"Another great meal Sunday at Copper. Perfectly seasoned Ribeye cook exactly med rare , the way it was ordered.  Bright tender asparagus.  Great conversation with the staff."}
{"text":"So much better than Copper Ale House! Food was great, staff was super friendly and the decor was way better! Loved all the appetizers that we tried. The Shrimp Scampi is what I had but was a little cold and needed some more seasoning."}
{"text":"Was impressed by the change of ownership  up until today. We asked for for our check literally 17 minutes ago and nothing. So disappointed with the service...wonder how long it's going to take."}
{"text":"We didn't have good luck with the old Ale House that was here, but decided to give this place a try seeing as they claimed to have switched management.  We came in and it was empty but the new decor looked nice so we were hopeful. All we wanted was an appetizer and a couple of beers.  We decided to do a flight... but had to explain to the waitress what that meant; ordered our five beers and just like before, they were out of one (despite telling us the menu was just printed the previous night). So we picked another one and a short time later someone else came over and said that the flight was only four beers, not five, and to get rid of one. We showed her the menu where it said 5 beers and she got snippy and irritated and said \"Well I guess I can give you the fifth one.\" Well, yeah, because we didn't print your menu and we were just picking off the list you provided.  She acted like she was doing us a huge favor but never apologized for the error or anything.  The only food we ordered were the cheese fries and they were semi-cold in the middle and I wasn't impressed.  This place is off our list for good."}
{"text":"Completely different place! New owners and managers. Give this place a second chance. Everyone is great. The food is fantastic and one of the best places in concord/Kannapolis area."}
