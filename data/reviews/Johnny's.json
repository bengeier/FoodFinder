{"text":"Growing up in Pittsburgh, we have been to many restaurants, but never Johnny's.  We came to see a very close friend sing, and decided to have dinner.  What a pleasant surprise it was.  The decor is slightly dated, but by no means would I call it extremely old and the restaurant was very clean.   We were greeted by a very friendly waitress, who happened to be the owner and learned all of our names.   She welcomed us and provided exceptional service.  There were 8 of us and we all ordered something different.  All entrees were served hot and very tasty.   My wife said the eggplant was up there with the best.  I had The Chicken Romano and it was very very good.   Lightly breaded, not greasy and very juicy.   The rest of our party was very pleased with their food too.  After our meals, we were introduced to our watiresses husband, (part owner) and chef.   He was very friendly as well.  With the great singing of Sue Leslie and the excellent food, it was a great evening.   We will be returning to Johnnys in the near future.  We were the youngest group there that evening, where the crowd seems to be of the older version, but that did not distract from the experience."}
{"text":"Not sure about the other complaints. We had a fantastic meal and the service was never an issue. All seven of us had a different entree and each was delicious."}
{"text":"Food was ok but it took 3 hours to get it!! We arrived an hour before the music so we could get our order in..our waitress didn't take our order for almost an hour then we did not get food until 2 more hours! When we complained to the owners wife she blamed the waitress, was nasty and did not ever apologize. It seems they know they will be busy on Sat night and do not really care if their customers are happy.  WILL NOT BE GOING back!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Johnny's this week and I had one of the best meals I have had lately 
My wife had the pasta with sausage and meatball. I had one of the best chicken parmigiana ever. The chicken although it was a thick pice was very moist. We both thought the sauce was delicious (I am very fussy about my red sauce) we enjoyed the salads you could tell the vegetables were fresh and the dressing tasty. The wedding soup had a lot of large bits of chicken and plenty of small meatballs with escarole 
We would highly recommend this place if you enjoy good Italian food"}
{"text":"Lesson in Speed-eating.
Martini, appetizer, salad, bottle of wine and entrée and out the door in 45 minutes. The food may or may not have been good. It was hard to tell. The salad came 5 minutes after the appetizer and the entrée came five minutes after the salad. The waitress seemed miffed when I said \"that was fast\" when I had to move aside the salad that I didn't get a chance to taste so I could be given my entrée. This was confirmed when I got the dirty look on the way out. I guess it's a slam down your food and get the hell out policy. No wonder the place was empty."}
{"text":"Great Italian, family friendly. Service and atmosphere was excellent. I love the live entertainment which makes for a great date night. We also had a private party there and the staff was very accommodating. Highly recommend johnnys!"}
{"text":"Ah, Johnny's! This place is like... the epitome of Family Restaurant. At least... for my family it is. No visit to Pennsylvania is complete without a group of us coming here for dinner. My grandparents 50th wedding anniversary was here (which unfortunately, I couldn't attend ): )

Food isn't fantastic, but it's good, and we always enjoy ourselves. When I visited recently, I heard that the restaurant had changed management so we were all a little concerned about the quality when we went for dinner. I couldn't remember if it had changed or not, but my aunt thought her eggplant had been better before or something, but maybe she was just being picky :P The staff is the same, still friendly and knowing everyones names. The same people still go. My gramma went to school with one of the old dudes we'd always see there without fail... I think he was the mayor? But he's really old, and his name is Cooch or Hooch or something. Anyway it was always cute seeing my tottering old gramma with her tottering old classmate. Man... people stay in Wilmerding forever :P. Anyway... last time we went he was apparently really sick and wasn't there ): which is sad. Enough of my rambling... but you can see how its one of those great places that you have stories about and will always return to.

Also, the last time we went was especially amazing because Pittsburgh jazz legend Howard Betters performed, and it was really really fun :D He is awesome. Yeah, I was a member of that loud table right next to the stage that clapped along with every song :P"}
{"text":"Here's the good (and I'm not being ironic or facetious): the overall quality of the food.

And the bad: EVERYTHING ELSE.

Reservations at 7PM (party of 10, with 5 being regulars). Ordered at 7:30, apps came at 8:15, main course (drum roll please)... came at 10 fricking PM. No lie. And place was half full on a Friday night. Moreover, there was no apology by the server or the manager/owner. Moreover; no comps but the offer of a free drink. 
The decor is straight outta a bad Staten Island joint from 1955, with the average customer age well over Social Security.
My advice: get takeout, skip the AWFUL service."}
{"text":"My father lived in Wilmerding when I was a kid, up on George street. The streets and alleyways of the town were my stomping grounds in the summers I would spend with him, riding my bike to the Y for summer camp, walking down to the Little Store at all hours for some of their delicious fried chicken (and playing video games in the back, before anythign as classy and the Station Break existed),  buying New Kids on the Block swag at Phil's Pharmacy (don't be jelly)
In all of the time spent in that town I realized when I walked in the door of Johnny's tonight that I had never stepped foot in that building before. And after dinner there I question why that had never happened. 
I went to Johnny's tonight to hear a friend sing (Liz and Duke a.k.a. Back Together) and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The service was very good, attentive and Yinzer friendly (that's a good thing) The food even better (Chicken Parm....huge portion of chicken, tons of yummy sweetish sauce and cheese! yumyumyum!) I had a great time tonight and cannot wait to head back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Split personality alert.   I really want to like this place. It's a community restaurant nestled in the business district of Wilmerding.  Walking in the door, it's like stepping back in time 50 years...no problem there, but definitely geared toward a more traditional crowd.    

The food was really good.  I had the Johnny's salad with bleu cheese, the duck wings with fig glaze, and the risotto.   I also sampled the chicken romano.  The fig glaze was way too sweet for my palate; but otherwise, I was really happy with the meal.   

The service on the other hand was bad.  I mean...really bad.  It's been a while since I have encountered a server with such a poor attitude about serving people. 
- We had a large party (maybe 12 or so).  Only half of us were given menus to start with.  When I asked the server for more, she said \"can't you share?\" and then only begrudgingly went and got more.   
- She complained about everything.  We wanted separate checks - complaint.   We ordered a frozen drink - complaint.   We ordered drinks with our food - complaint.  We sent back a dish that we didn't order - complaint.  Ridiculous.  
- The food took about an hour and then came out all unorganized.   I get it was a large party, but geez.   The first round of drinks also sat on the bar for a good 20 minutes before the bartender asked another server to bring them out.    
- The person who sent back the dish she didn't order got no apology for having to sit and watch us all eat for 15 minutes while the correct dish was made.  Instead, she just got attitude because the server had to work a little extra to correct her error.
- My drinks were $6.50 at the bar, but magically rose to $7.00 when I got to the table.  I didn't notice it till I got home; but I feel quite certain that if I had questioned it, the answer would have been along the lines of \"It's only a dollar - can't you just pay it?\"

Overall, a really poor service experience, but a promising menu."}
{"text":"Awesome and reasonable! Very friendly and the food is fabulous!People are coming from miles around and visit Johnie's in Wilmerding!"}
{"text":"This place gets a star because the 2 guys that were there for entertainment were ok. 
We sat down at 7:00 ordered by 7:15. At 8:30 we were told they were out of the special !!??? Dinners were served at 8:55, really 7 out of ten were, another 10 minutes to bring the other 3 and finish orders. 
The stuffed eggplant is all filling and grease, I really don't think There was any actual eggplant In the dish! The Marinara and Tomato sauce is the worst ever!!! 
An entire glass of red wine was spilled, glass broken, wine all over, the boy cleaned up half assed then we never saw him again!
I would never eat there again!!
Oh, the bread was good."}
{"text":"Johnnie's has excellent food. However, the service is atrocious.  My last visit, we had appetizers and then waited an hour and a half to get our entrees.  We told them that we were leaving. My brother paid the bill. They did not even comp the appetizers. We paid for everything and did not receive our entree or get it to go. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Four of us decided it was time for some small town Italian cuisine.  Small town... BIG taste!

First the only CON we came up with:  The place is big and it was very crowded.  The kitchen couldn't keep up with the orders.  We didn't mind, as we were still in full holiday mode, but could be an issue for some.

We tried for the Oysters Rockefeller to start, but they were out.  There were plenty of others to choose from, but not what were set on, so no replacement.

Salads were fresh, crisp and the house dressing had a pleasant zip.  Bread fresh, real butter...  yay!

I had the scallops - they were worth the wait.  Very large and on a bed of spinach sautéed with bacon.  Each scallop seated on a perfectly ripened tomato slice.  Oh my yum.

Hubs had the pasta special.  Ho hum yum...

Friend had the Eggplant Stuffed Parm and it was beautiful and a large portion.  She pronounced it as tasty as it was lovely.

Two of us ordered the risotto as a side - it was in cream sauce and very soupy, not unpleasant - but not what we expected. 

Service was excellent and ambiance was casual, warm and inviting. 

We all voted thumbs up and cannot wait to continue to explore the menu!"}
{"text":"If you want great home made Italian food this is the place you need to be. I've been coming here for years and it's by far my favorite place to eat. The only complaint I have is that sometimes the service is a little slow but trust me the food is worth the wait! Fried provolone and zucchini are a must, oh the beans and greens too!! For main courses the chicken ala Johnnys or chicken Alfredo parm. They have entertainment on saturdays so if you want to go then I suggest a reservation because they are usually booked for the whole night. Otherwise, I say go on a tuesday/wed when it's less busy."}
{"text":"Oh no. Johnny's! I've been trying to review you for at least a year, and haven't been able to figure out if that review would be good, bad, or ambivalent. Tonight's experience pushed it firmly into the bad category, all thanks to one shitty employee. 

I went with my husband and mother-in-law for dinner on a Friday night. It's a semi-regular spot in our rotation, because we like the food, usually have good waitresses, and she has been going there for decades. All started out well, we got a round of drinks quick enough, which never hurts. Ordered the delicious arancini, then soup/salad, and entrees. Once the soup course was cleared away, we ran into a long wait. A very, very long wait. Long enough that the waitress came and apologized it had been so long, explaining they had a very large party in the back, and our entrees were backed up while the kitchen worked on their food. Fair enough - but then it was another 15 minutes or so before we stopped a food runner passing by to ask where our food was. She checked and said it would be out shortly, and it arrived about 5 minutes later. The entrees were all delicious.

So from the time we ordered to the time we got entrees, we waited more than 90 minutes. We were asking for a check after being there just under 2 hours. That's a bit rough, especially for an 80 year old Italian girl. So naturally, she asked to talk to a manager. And that is when things went all wrong for Johnny's. The manager was an absolutely miserable, nasty person to deal with, which is the last thing a restaurant should send to a table that's already had a negative experience to start with.

On a Friday night during dinner service, the manager was sitting on her ass talking to a table. There's no excuse for a guest to need to request the manager in the first place - we were there long enough that she was doing a poor job by not having checked in with us already. Also, other tables around us had complained to the wait staff, and if she didn't know that and stop to talk to them too, shame on her. One table got so tired of waiting for food they had it boxed up to go before it ever even got to them. On hearing that a table had requested her, she was visibly uninterested in getting on her feet, but eventually managed to wander over with a dramatic eye roll to see what the problem was.

She should have just refused to do her job at all, she did such a bad job of it. She came to the table, curtly heard my mother-in-law's complaint, said she needed to talk to the wait staff and stomped away. When she eventually returned, she brought a check, and stated that she had taken off the appetizer and a round of drinks, and informed us that when we return she would need to PERSONALLY wait on us because we always complain when we go there. 

Wait, do we? Oh right. The last time we were there, the hostess sat us at a table with a good half a plate of French fries on the floor. We asked if we could sit somewhere else, or if the fries could be cleaned up. She just shrugged and asked what she was supposed to do about it. That was so unintentionally funny, we laughed. After we had ordered someone did come over to sweep them up. We then had a very similar experience - drinks, apps, and soup came out, then an hour plus wait for entrees. And then . . . the food came out . . . wrong. So no, we didn't want that entrée, and took the right one home in a box, because that's way too long to wait for the wrong food. That time the waitress handled the mix up beautifully and left us happy enough that we never questioned going back. 

We usually go to Johnny's 8-10 times a year, and that's the only time I remember having a serious complaint before. After having 2 bad experiences, and bringing it up each time, the manager let us know that we are the problem. After she dropped the check, she walked away and threw a dish into the bus pan, so hard it may have broken. Wrong answer, honey. Don't be rude to a couple middle aged queens and their favorite girl.

I'm a manager. And I can say, manager to manager, you're doing it all wrong. When a customer has a bad experience, they most likely aren't going to let you know, and aren't going to give you the chance to fix it. Instead they will tell all their friends, and go online to passively aggressively tell the internet all the things you did wrong that they didn't tell you. Every time a customer complains, you need to take that seriously, because there are 20 other people who were mad but just paid and left mad. You need to take that feedback, be grateful, and do the best you can to rectify the situation. There's no reason to get upset with a guest for being honest about how your service failed to meet their expectations, you're just being a really bad manager for acting that way. 

It's unfortunate I left tonight so unhappy. The restaurant has only the manager to blame for that. Mistakes happen, that is inevitable. It's how you handle them when they happen that makes them understandable."}
