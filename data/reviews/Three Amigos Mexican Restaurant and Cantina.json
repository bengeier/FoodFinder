{"text":"Good food, but service was slow. We arrived as a bunch if tables were turning over, so I thinks tickets got mixed up in the kitchen. At least two groups who were seated after us were served & finished eating before we got our meals. Our server was attentive in keeping our chips, salsa, and drinks refreshed. She apologized for the delay and noted the manager was in the kitchen cooking to help catch up the backlog. I will return for the food, but hope for a better orchestrated service."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have ever had. Period. Very large portions and fresh ingredients. I'm not crazy I have had a lot or Mexican in my life. Quesadilla especial and arroz con pollo were on point"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. My carne asada was not good at all. The meat was fatty and tough and I could barely cut through it.  I actually only had a few bites. 

The chips and salsa were good, service was fine, but I just wasn't impressed with the entree"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal when it comes to yummy Mexican food!  The server is always friendly, if a little bit shy.  And, the Mexican MTV on the TV just adds to the overall ambience.  The real star here is the food.  The guacamole is excellent, and all versions of the enchiladas I've tried are as well.  Breakfast is wonderful here, especially if you've had a night of it and need something to help you break through the fuzz.  This is not a fancy place, but it is great for a casual get-together with friends who enjoy good, fresh Mexican food."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! So happy about the location, since it is right near my campus! The white queso dip is flawless, and everything tastes super fresh and flavorful! Not only does the food taste incredible, but the staff there are very helpful, when asked about the menu! SO GOOD."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Mexican restaurant. The handmade enchiladas are particularly excellent. The spicy rojo and the mole are my favorites, but I have tried them all on regular visits to this restaurant, and all are tasty. I like to roast chiles and make traditional sauces at home, so I know these are authentic. They also use fresh Mexican-style cheeses. All they need is to offer a salsa verde for the table, for tacos. I love this place."}
{"text":"Indifferent service and bland food that took more than 40 minutes (a table for two next to us who arrived after we did left before their entrees arrived because they were tired of waiting). This restaurant looks like it never gets cleaned. It took about five minutes for a server to greet us in spite of the fact that there were six servers and we were one of six active tables. At one point our server was standing in the kitchen eating while we waited for our food. The closest thing we received to service was a different server noticing me coughing and offering me a water. At the time he was standing next to our server who was staring off into space. Someone needs to start paying attention to any details at this place."}
{"text":"If you want cheap, authentic, well seasoned mexican food this place is great.

I have been twice (dine in once, take out once) and yes the previous reviewers are not exagerating about the broken english.  I have had the enchiladas verde, enchiladas rojas and the enchiladas covered in mole.  Of those three the ehchiladas verde are by far my favorite."}
{"text":"Three Amigos is amazing!!  Best Mexican food in Charlotte hands down. Ask for Victor for great service. We are from Texas and have struggled to find good Mexican food- we now have our spot! The margaritas were also the best we have had in Charlotte!! If only they had homemade tortillas..."}
{"text":"We were not in the mood for cooking dinner one night and we love Mexican food. The result - we went to Three Amigos after reading some nice reviews. The place was a bit small, but managed to have a bar within the premise, and was comfortable enough to accommodate quite a few people. The waiters arrived promptly, and took our orders. Nachos and salsa were on the house and we ordered guacamole along with it - guacamole was very good. For our entrees, we ordered Enchiladas Poblanos and Fajitas de Pollo. The Fajitas was served on a hot plate, and we enjoyed making our own Fajitas with the little corn tortillas. The enchiladas were also good. We had next to nothing left over, and what ever was left, we boxed it and had it the next day. Overall, a very nice dinner, good ambiance (a bit noisy, but this should be expected), good service and we had a nice experience going there.
Tip - First Check-in with Foursquare would give you a free small guacamole when you buy two entrees."}
{"text":"Thanks to amazing reviews, my fiance and I tried this place last night. And it did not disappoint! Amazing food, atmosphere and service. New favorite restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"The best enchiladas hands down!!!! Great Mexican food, huge portions and fairly priced.
I know great Mexican food and this place was legit.
It's small and popular so it was packed on a Saturday night.

Yummy!"}
{"text":"I went this weekend and was pleasantly surprised.  They have Mexican  Coca Cola (which is made with sugar cane) which was a fun touch.

I had the Enchiladas Rojas which were quite tasty despite being made with Chicken, which was very tender.

As others have said, this place is easier if you can Hablar the Espanol (I can't, so \"no aguacate\" somehow turned out to be extra avocado...)    

I'm not done looking for THE really good, really cheap Mexican place in Charlotte, but at least I have a solid contender."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! I also get the Enchiladas Verde. Comes with fresh avocado and rice and beans. Such a fun spot to grab a quick lunch or have drinks wish friends! 

The only reason for the 4 stars is the location. It isn't far down Central but it isn't in the best of shopping centers."}
{"text":"Love this place! I had no idea a great mexican restaurant was right down the street from my neighborhood until trying it a few months ago. The queso is awesome, as well as the enchiladas."}
{"text":"Fantastic hole in the wall! Great staff and even better food. The mole is not to be passed up! Chips have a great seasoning on them."}
{"text":"So, I'm giving it 2 stars because it was clean and our server was very friendly. But, the food took 50 min to get to us and it had no flavor. You get a lot of food for an inexpensive price, but it was tasteless. Sorry. Because they're very sweet."}
{"text":"One of us was a little skeptical about this place as it is located far enough down Central that it starts to get in the not so nice part of town.  But we ended up liking it a lot actually despite the location.  The place was clean, service was good, we parked out front but we got the last spot...not sure if there are other parking options.

I don't remember exactly what we got but for those of you who are Jim Gaffigan fans you can be sure it was some sort of meat, cheese, and tortilla mix.  Sorry, couldn't resist.  We got the carne asada and the enchiladas al hormo.  Both pretty good.  Also they served drinks (sprite) straight from the can...not bragging or complaining...just stating a fact.

I know our rating seems a little low for how much we liked it but the problem is that the difference between bad Mexican food and good Mexican food just isn't that much.  Especially when you are talking about Americanized Mexican food.

We give it 3.5 amigos out of 5"}
{"text":"***Gluten-free friendly*** The sister restaurant of Sabor Latin Street Grill should not be missed! If you are a fan of guacamole, this is quite possibly the best chunky guac in town.  The margaritas are delicious are they are BIG.  I could be imagining this, but it feels like the menu has changed over the years and become less focused on enchiladas than it used to be. Regardless, the food is delicious. The kitchen, however, can be very slow. If they are busy, it is quite possible that you'll be waiting for a bit for your food. The last few times I ate there, I took 90% of my meal home bc I was full on chips, queso, and guac by the time it arrived. Not all Mexican/Latin American food reheats well, so this is something to keep in mind.  ***I have Celiac Disease, and I'm happy to report that I've never gotten sick at Three Amigos.***"}
{"text":"THE best Mexican in Charlotte! Authentic and fresh. Super delicious!! Be sure to try the fresh squeezed margarita and enchiladas with scratch-made red sauce. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I hate to have to decrease my review, but not as much as I hate the fact that I will never return to this establishment. I have frequented this restaurant for many years, but my last few experiences have been terrible. Every single time I order my food, they bring it out wrong. It happens so frequently that it makes me wonder if they do it on purpose. They can't be bothered with checking on you, refilling your drinks or offering a smile. I feel like I'm bothering them by being there. I order the same thing every time I go & order it the exact same way, but every time I go there's either extra ingredients on it or something is missing. The last time this happened & after I was lucky enough go get a waiters attention to tell her about it, I was told it depends on who makes it. Really? No point in reading the menu here ... You just have to hope that it's made correctly & if it isn't & you're brave enough to complain, get ready for attitude. Time to find another mexican place that actually appreciates having faithful customers & will make my order the way that I request!"}
{"text":"So, I went over to the place which is in my neighborhood - figuring even mediocre mexican food is still pretty good.  And that is pretty much what I got.

The food that I had was decent, not great not horrible, but very serviceable.  The chips with salsa were quite good, and they even broke out the spicy green salsa which was a good bit spicier but not as flavorful.  The tacos al pastor (marinated pork) were fine, but as is the case often with those tacos, a bit dry.  The sides of rice and beans gave me plenty to eat.  The beer was fine, and if I had known the dos equis was only 3 dollars a bottle I would have stuck with that rather than the negra modelo.

In terms of service, I sat at the bar and was well served by my waitress amoung others.  Everyone was quite friendly and helpful.  That said, the meal did take a loooong time to come out, especially from a not quite full restaurant.  They kept me happy with chips, salsa, beer and conversation so Im not complaining too much.  I really liked the casual but friendly vibe.

The prices are fine, but I didnt find them to be ridiculously cheap as another poster said.  I am new to charlotte but would pay the same type of price in any taqueria in brooklyn.

So, overall it wasnt a memorable experience, but even still it was alright and Ill probably be back to try some other plates since it is in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Easily some of the best Mexican food we have had in Charlotte. Had the enchilada mixtas and started with some guacamole. Really enjoyed it all. Solid service. Tuesday 1/2 price craft beers is an awesome special!!"}
{"text":"The food is great, and not to say it for the 902nd time, but the margaritas are honestly the best I've ever had. Don't let the location turn you off, it's a strip mall-ish situation, but once inside you won't notice or care."}
{"text":"Food here is awesome. the portions were very large and definitely will fill you up. i had a chicken chimichanga. the shell was crispy and delicious. flavors meshed very well with each other with no additions of hot sauce. for dessert we had the flan and it was good."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food at a great price.  I've had their mole and tacos on different occasions. I recommend the tacos al pastor as a delicious selection. The food is really good and fresh and can't beat it for mexican"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican, fresh prepared meals, nothing cooked and saved overnight.  Asada is awesome, perfectly marinated.  If you want excellent service, food, and a friendly atmosphere, 3 Amigos is the place."}
{"text":"Very standard Mexican food. Nothing special like I see everyone else writing about. Went with a party of four so sampled everything. Ingredients fresh and food good but I guess I thought it would be so much better than all the other Mexican restaurants in Charlotte.

The location and appearance are not very inviting. Prices are good."}
{"text":"The food was great! The service was REALLY slow and there were very few people being served. Salsa and chicken tacos were wonderful. Allow for extra time when eating here."}
{"text":"Great place for a decent mexican meal.  Went there with the Google offer coupon wondering if would be ok and it was good.  The chips and salsa are pretty good - the chips have some kind of seasoning on them I've never seen at a mexican restaurant but the were delicious.  The food was good as well, definitely not amazing by any means but very functional for that cheesy hangover cure I tend to get a craving for time and again.  Specials seemed pretty good too - $2 corona's on sundays and $2.50 on Mondays. They even have an all you can eat enchilada day during the week along with more pretty awesome drink specials.  All in all its a good restaurant with good food, if you want amazingly good mexican go somewhere like cantina or something like that.  If you want a good meal at a good price made by authentic mexican people you can't go wrong with Three Amigos."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. The tacos al pastor are great, all the shrimp dishes are great, and house margaritas on Friday for $5. Only drawback to Central Ave location is parking and very small seating area - but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte! The food & staff are definitely worth the wait. Some of our favorites: house margs, queso fundido, enchiladas verde & chicken mole!"}
{"text":"Very casual, small, inexpensive Mexican place with the standard fare.  Sometimes I feel guilty getting the standard plate of enchiladas, beans, and rice.  But it's good!  My husband and I both had enchiladas and the kids had a quesadilla.  Great place to go if you want typical Mexican but want to feel that it's at least semi-authentic."}
{"text":"Two words: Super. Yum. Three Amigos is consistently good, fast and friendly. I love that it is open after midnight (shocking here in Charlotte where the concept of late night food seems to be lost on the restaurants). I love love love the enchiladas. Overall, I'd recommend dining here very highly. Gets minus one star only because I've had a few very mediocre take-out experiences(i.e. cold food, wrong order, small portions), but no one is perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, which is expected in east Charlotte. Standard Fare Mexican. Consistently good. Small hole in the wall. It is on the louder side and always hopping. Sometimes you have to wait. Wait staff is well groomed and bi-lingual. Atmosphere is festive and colorful Mexican. Clientele is completely American, mostly from the surrounding neighborhoods. I always leave stuffed. Consistently delicious. Reasonably priced.
Great for family or just going out with friends. Good drink selection"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Ordered this from Postmates. Possible that some of my displeasure could be due to delivery quality--some of the items look like someone threw them into the box. Unappetizing presentation.

But even so, the quality of the food and care with which it was prepared was lacking. Worst tacos al pastor I've ever had. The pork had little flavor, was disgustingly fatty, and the tortillas were torn and shredded. Also, no pineapple-y sauce or anything. Just some cilantro and onions. Very dry. 

Chicken enchiladas verde were unrecognizable in the sloppy mess of a box they arrived in. Good flavor for the chicken. But sloppy mess of lettuce and sour cream on top made it taste more like tortilla soup than an enchilada. And again, the tortillas were ripped. 

Next up the chicken tacos. Again, just a sloppy mess of lettuce and cheese and sour cream. 

Finally the guacamole. Nice and chunky and fresh. But absolutely no flavor. No zing. No salt. Just bland. 

Good homemade chips though. 

If the food showed up like this for carry out or at the table I'd be giving a 1. Giving some benefit of the doubt for delivery issues. But this establishment should figure out how to prepare its food for delivery if they continue to use a delivery service. Maybe items that make the food soggy should go on the side?  But also, its Mexican food and should have some flavor, right!?"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place - I really did!  But alas, mediocre at best - coming from California, a high bar has been set for Mexican food and this doesn't even come close - enchilada sauce was strangely sweet, our order of guacamole never arrived at our table and our waitress seemed more interested is looking at the window than waiting on us.  Meat (skirt steak) had a nice flavor but was tough - there is a fine line to cooking this cut of meat correctly and it just didn't happen.  Rice and beans just average.  My still favorite place is Senior Tequila's."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, great beer selection, great home made salsa on the house, and home made Mexican. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego, it's been hard to find good mexican food in the CLT. Three Amigos is my savior. Chips were freshly made and the enchiladas Rojas were fantastico. I'll be back, probably next week."}
{"text":"Best Mexican I have ever had. I drive trucks all over the country, including to the edge of the US-Mexican border, and this is by far the best I've had.

A good measure of this place is to taste their refried beans - wow! I had a burrito last time I went and am craving another visit to have one again. 

They also have plantains. They're super delicious and would be a perfect desert if I didn't prefer having them as an appetizer. I didn't see them on the menu last time, but be sure to ask for an order, they're still available. 

As soon as I get back in town I'm heading there!"}
{"text":"Holy food coma.

Charming, small hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint.
Booths and tables.
Pleasant, efficient service.
Music varied from Mariachi-style to Ibiza techno.
Which cracked me up in a good way.

Stopped in by myself for an early dinner -@Five-ish.

Salsa was delish, although it is of the soupier variety  and I prefer some chunk to my salsa. Still, the flavors were balanced and there was a nice little black pepper zing.

Guac was fresh and just a wee bit salty for me, but hey, I took the remainder home so that says something.

Ordered the Green Chile enchiladas sub veggies for the protein.
It was GINORMOUS. I managed to eat a full half a portion. And I'm happily stuffed.

Lots of crisp lettuce on top too, rather than the sad little side garnish of lettuce you may see at other joints. The cotilla was fresh and plentiful too.

And, normally I cringe at the ever-present side of refried beans and rice - but again, freshly made and tasty.

Didn't have a Marg this time, but spied some on the other tables that looked worthwhile.

In short, I will be going back WHEN I recover from my current food coma."}
{"text":"My brother ordered food to be picked up, i went to the eastfield location thinking it was ordered there and they gave a bad attitude about it not being ordered there.. went to this location and they gave a bad attitude and hung up on my brother when he called to confirm the order was at this location and they hung up on him. Sucks that we were already halfway there otherwise I would've taken that as a hint to not bother. I honestly don't know how they were able to take our order, give us a total of the order,  and not have it or know about it. My brother confirmed the phone number he took the order with and it was for this place... Never ate here and now I never will with how crowded and rude these people were at both places."}
{"text":"LOVE the food! I used to live in San Diego, then Houston. The Baja Mexican and TexMex are missed, for sure. Until I had Three Amigos, I had just about given up on the food here (no offense, Charlotte). I'd never had Quipe. It was delicious. The Margaritas are also superb. While the restaurant may not have the best ambiance, the food is some of the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Being from Mexico I get this question all the time. \"What's the most authentic Mexican place in Charlotte\". I always send them to Three Amigos.  While it is impossible to replicate the real flavors of Mexico or really any other country. This place come pretty darn close.  The Tacos al Pasto and the Mole are some of the best around."}
{"text":"Absolute best Mexican food in a city with a lot of good Mexican food. The quesadilla especial is unreal. Prices are low food and service is great!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. You should make sure to come here and use the deals they have. The portion sizes are huge so don't fill up on too many of the delicious seasoned chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"My husband and I highly recommend Three Amigos. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was casual & comfortable, and the food was great! Their salsa is so good & the dishes we ordered were incredibly affordable & had so much flavor. Only thing that would make it better is if they used local, pastured meat & poultry. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"As a native of Los Angeles, I grew up eating lots of Mexican food. Three Amigos, hands down, is the BEST Mexican food in Charlotte (and I have tried most all of them in the past 23+ years here). The atmosphere is rustic and comfortable. The servers are attentive. At the Central Ave. location ask for Margarita (the server they named the drink after). The cervezas are C-O-L-D COLD. My favorite selection is the Enchiladas Poblanas. It is smothered in what has to be the BEST molé sauce I have ever tasted. I eat there most every week. It's THAT good."}
{"text":"I'm a FOODIE, I admit it and that is why I HAVE to start working out again. I told my mom I need to get my  mouth wired.

ANYWAY, enough about me and my personal tantrums! On to business...THREE AMIGOS!

After reading the reviews the night before, I was ready to run out of the door in the pouring rain to try this AWESOME Mexican food. I was tired of the chain restaurants and wanted something authentic, not to mention the rave about the margaritas.

Alas, my boyfriend and I went to Three Amigos for lunch yesterday. Talking about shabby chic - just the way I like it. From experience the most shabbiest places has the best food. If you're looking for ambiance, this is not the place for you - go to Cantina for that (their food isn't all that great either). Anyway, so my boyfriend and I ordered the enchiladas. I had the Enchilada Verde...hands down I loved the sauce. When they placed that mound in front of me, I said..surely I can not eat all of this BUT as soon as I took my first bite, I smiled!

My boyfriend ordered the enchilada with the red sauce, I want to say it was called Enchalada Roja - he enjoyed it as well!

We will definitley be back and will try the other dishes my fellow Yelpers have raved about. 

BTW, the chips and salsa was okay - I've had better at On the Border (I know...CHAIN!) I'm so not a fan of Chain restaurants

Until next time, Yelp on fellow Foodies!"}
{"text":"A go to lunch spot... for real.  The lunch portions are equal to the dinner plates and a meal that runs you $9 at dinner is only $6.50 at lunch.  It's a bargain, and the food is tasty.  The menu has good options, like the taco plate with al pastor and carne asada or a loaded cheese covered chimichanga. Service has never been bad and the last time our lunch group went we had an exceptional server.  My dinner experiences are fine here but it stands out for lunch in all the best ways.  Sometimes the wait for the food is just a bit long, that's my only knock, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"So I took a jaunt to Plaza Midwood for lunch with some clients and friends.  TA has been on my radar as authentic and delicious.  I actually drove right by the place and turned around.  It's a rather small place tucked in a cruddy shopping center with very little parking.  

Since I was runing late, my friends were already noshing on some beautifully green and tasty guac and tortilla chips.After ordering, I realized why it is considered so authentic. My tacos were small flour tortillas open-faced with cubed beef cheese and cilantro. A heaping side of rice and refried beans.  I did ask for sour cream but never got it.  The portions were hardy and topped with the guac and salsa from the table made them quite tasty.  My friends ordered the pork belly tacos, shrimp quesilda and burritos.  All the portions were huge and the burrito was gorgeous, deep friend and top with queso sauce, sour cream tomatos and lettuce.  Believe me when I tell you that I didn't eat another meal until breakfast the next morning!"}
{"text":"If there is an authentic Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, this is it. The Enchiladas Rojas are outstanding! It's small, very small, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I've been back since my last post, just haven't updated it. The food has always been good, but the service continues to get better. Thanks for that!

Dinner was better this time. Kids definitely got served first which is a huge plus! Thanks for making the effort to improve."}
{"text":"Second visit to Three Amigos, this time to celebrate a birthday and treat some out of town friends.  It was just as good as last time, though this time we had an easier time communicating with our server, who informed us that basically anything they make (enchiladas, etc.), we could get with their grilled veggie mixture instead of meat.  SCORE.  She recommended the enchiladas verde, which was FANTASTIC.  I could slurp their verde sauce with a spoon.

Plantains once again instead of rice.  Seriously, they should just forgo the rice and serve fried plantains with every dish.  It could be their signature."}
{"text":"Really wasnt that great. Dont know what people see in this place. I got the Queso Fundido appitizer. All it was , was cheese? WTF. REally? it said it came with onion and chorizo . I also got Enchilada Verde with steak. Ugh really? this was the lowest grade meat ever. soooo fatty. I will never eat there again.  Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had since living in California. Actually, left me thinking that I was still in that area. It's also impressive to see that they have a vegan options. Very filling and leaves you with some food for later on."}
{"text":"I will start with saying no matter what happens at Three Amigos I will always love Three Amigos. I always order enchiladas (mixtas) so I really can't vouch for many other items but they are so good I feel no need to try anything else. I do not do this at any other restaurant and do admit it is lame.  It is 4 enchiladas with four different sauces and I always finish with the mole (it's my dessert). I also always order them with steak because I love the seasoning and it always comes with a little piece of bonus steak on the plate. The chips seem like the fryer may need to be turned up because they always have a little residual greasiness to them. The Mexican Coke and  Victoria beer are always cold and delicious. The service is always pleasant and entertaining. The music can be very inappropriate (Lil Jon Shots- YouTube it) but I find it HILARIOUS!! The Moby look-a-like across from me did not and insisted on his food to go. He looked like a hipster but was apparently wound a little tighter than his horn rims, Apple, tattoos, and  Indy Rock shirt conveyed. Without a doubt I will be back for my dose of rap and enchiladas."}
{"text":"Yarora - tasty-  French fries smothered in ketchup, ground beef, mayonnaise abd cheese -      Could nit even eat small large porti."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to Charlotte and visited this restaurant as recommended by a friend.  The service was terrible and we will never return for the following reasons:

When we arrived the restaurant was packed. We were invited to sit at the bar and wait for a table which was perfectly fine. However none of your waitresses offered to take our drink order. Once my husband waived one lady down she responded without a smile, served us as though we were a bother to her. While we waited no one else said anything. Another couple comes inside. Immediately their drink order is taken and they are offered chips and salsa while they waited. We were offered nothing. No drink or chips. Next we were informed that our table was ready. But when we got up from the bar not one waitress showed to the table or where it was.So we were just standing there. We were seated. After that the service was ok. Others in the establishment seemed to get smiles and excellent service. But we did not."}
{"text":"When going to this restaurant I thought that I was going to be really satisfied with the food after reading all of the \"great\"  reviews, BUT I was unpleasantly surprised. First the sanitation score is a 94 which should have given me the heads up. It is a very run down establishment very dirty. There was particles floating in my water, I order the Arroz Con Pollo which took over 25 minutes to get after we put or order in and it was BURNT! When I say burnt the onions where burnt to a black crisp! It was very unpleasant, I will not be going there EVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"From No Culinary Backwater.
A much anticipated but, a highly disappointing meal . I grew up eating a lot of Mexican food. Most was very good and some very very bad while living in California. Visiting Mexico City I was introduced to more authentic flavors. My friend's mother was a great home cook. She made fresh hand made tortillas. There was very few things which where much better than that. My first job as a line cook was in a Mexican restaurant. I was a souse chef in a hot Tex-Mex place in San Fransisco. Making friends with the remarkable Chef Guillermo Peters of Canal Street Bistro and his modern take on Mesoamerican cuisine . So I have a pretty good grasp on what makes a good meal from Mexican cuisine. Moving to Charlotte I was missing taste from home. My wife and I kept on hearing about Three Amigos http://www.threeamigoscharlotte.com/
. Canned microwaved , over seasoned or bland. Spanish rice made with frozen vegetables and condensed chicken MSG laden stock does not entice me to comeback. If your only exposure \"Mexican cuisine\" had been Taco Bell I guess you would call this a great place. For my time and money If i want good Mexican cuisine , I will have to make it myself."}
{"text":"Went for lunch this afternoon. As many awesome yelp reviews this place has gotten I'm really surprised it wasn't packed for lunch. We were literally the only people in the restaurant. 

First impressions...
Three Amigos is located in a small strip mall on Cental past the new McDonlads coming from uptown but before you get to the Eastway. When we walked in the waitress seated us immediately and took our drink orders and brought us chips and salsa. The restaurant decor is pretty cute a lot of colorful paintings. 

Food:
I ordered the chicken chimichanga and it was exactly as I pictured it. Perfect. It might just be a \"me\" thing but I really do prefer shredded chicken in my Mexican food compared to chunks. The chimichanga had just that. It was hot, fresh, crispy and delicious. Most of the lunch specials come with rice and beans like most Mexican restaurants. 

Service: VERY FRIENDLY!!!
Oh....and I had to do a double take at the price! Really only $5.95??? Umm... I think I should get out of uptown more often and drive down to Three Amigos!

One word: Authentic!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and large portions. I had mixtas enchiladas so I got to try 4 of them. Loved the mole and hot red sauce  the most. The quest was a hit with my kids and they loved their burritos. Can't wait to go back and try more. Went on a Sunday afternoon to avoid crowds. Great service. Michaleda was great too!"}
{"text":"I visited Three Amigos on a recommendation for the Mole Enchiladas. I actually hate Mole, but our out-of-tower guests are huge fans so I decided to suck it up.

We ordered some margaritas which were a mixed bag. Delicious, fresh taste, but completely and totally lacking in alcohol. I was running on bone-dry stomach and even after a large there wasn't even the beginning hint of a buzz. Perhaps they were trying to upsell their half-off tequila shot special for the night?

We ordered our food and let's get the best part of the night out of the way: The mole was freaking amazing. A little spicy, not to sweet, with flavors that were really missing from my previous experiences. I also got a dish with a little thin slab of steak that tasted delicious. It wasn't tender or anything, but when you have a slice that's a couple mm thick you want it to be crusty and salty rather than super soft.

Now to the bad. I got more traditional enchiladas and I'll be honest: I was expecting a heck of a lot more. There were 4 very skinny enchiladas (explaining how the all-you-can-eat special came around), covered with an INSANE amount of lettuce and tasteless cheese, with a little dashing of super bitter onions. Beneath at least 2 inches of filler, the enchiladas were already fighting a losing battle and had virtually nothing to offer anyway. The queso being bland wasn't an issue really, I know it's mostly there for decoration, but the veggies were what sealed the deal.
In addition, the chips that we got were pretty gross. They had some seasoning on them but they were cold and stale. The salsa tasted pretty good, but the cilantro was crushed instead of sliced in big soggy leaves.

I'll also say that the tacos al pastor my neighbor had were determined to be mediocre as well.

It looks like Three Amigos is a neighborhood staple for Plaza Midwood. The problem is that it seems like the hipsters in the neighborhood have given them a pass. \"Authenticity\" does not have to be a synonym for bland, but it seems like they've carried their name based on just their mole. There needs to be more than a sauce behind a restaurant, and I'm not sure I'll be back.

Final (not inconsequential) point was that service was very friendly and efficient, which saved this rating from 2 stars. Add a little salt and some peppers to your other dishes (though who knows if you can due to regulars) and this place could actually be pretty great."}
{"text":"I finally found a legit Mexican Restaurant in Charlotte other than Monterreys.  I ordered the Alambra, the steak was seasoned perfectly.  The staff was very friendly, an I love the old world music (opposed to spanish hip-hop).  I will be eating here several times a week from now on."}
{"text":"This place is usually busy with a 20 minute wait time at peak hours on Friday and Saturday. Their margaritas are awesome and they even use fresh orange juice instead of all that sugary sweet and sour mix. Portions are large in my opinion and as a couple you can leave stuffed with a 25-30$ bill (excluding alcohol). My favorites are the queso dip, tostadas with pork, and their chicken tacos because they are so fresh tasting. Sometimes the service is a little slow, but overall this is my first choice if I want mexican food!"}
{"text":"Wherever there are margaritas, you will find us.
Wherever there are chips and salsa, we'll be there.
Wherever liberty is threatened, you will find...
The Three Amigos!

This place is no Ned Nederlander! It's definitely more of a Lucky Day (If you have no idea about the movie Three Amigos...you're completely lost...but that's okay...well...for me anyhow)!

Situated in the neighborhood of...not sure I really want to park my car here, Three Amigos brings a robust assortment of great tasting Mexican dishes. I've eaten many of their dishes and enjoyed all of them. If you're looking for Mexico...tough...if you're looking for great Mexican flavors that tend to aim for gringos...you're in luck.

The salsa and margaritas are so-so...but real salsa and real margaritas would likely make their patrons mad when they saw the price tag.

The inside is what you'd expect of a Mexican restaurant...and like many Mexican restaurants we've been to, they don't have a ton of space to maneuver. So if you hate rubbing elbows with people...not your place.

What to get: The Tacos al Pastor are spot on

What to avoid: Nothing really, just avoid the lofty expectations of your visits to Mexico"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time. The carne tacos were pretty good but for the price of almost $10 you only get 2 tacos with a small serving of rice and bean which is on the pricey side for the amount of food. The enchilada were ok, nothing I would go back for. I rather stop by a taco truck to get tacos for $1.50 each."}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've eaten in Charlotte.

I grew up near Chicago, which has a big Mexican population dating back to the 1930s, and I lived for four years as an adult in Southern California, so you can say I'm a big fan of Mexican.  My litmus test for any Mexican joint is the beans, and this place passed with flying colors.  

All the food I've had here was good.  If I were 20 years younger and lived closer to this place, I'd eat here three times per week."}
{"text":"Enchiladas Mixtas were darn good. I got a different meat in each one and they were all good. I was excited to see a Paloma on the drink menu, but their Margaritas are great, too. We got there around 6 on a Saturday which was perfect timing because it got quite crowded around 7. Guac was good and table salsa was good. Wouldn't mind a salsa bar and the service could have been bit more efficient, but nothing that should deter you from checking out these enchiladas."}
{"text":"Sign currently says Three Amigos.  I've been here twice and enjoyed both times.  It is super cheap and delicious.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive.  I love the guacamole.

Warning that you may be turned off by the shadiness of the strip-mall center when you pull up, but you must power through and go inside.  Once you get your chips and salsa you will be just fine!"}
{"text":"There $5 margaritas on Fridays are great. Main reason we go!! There salsa is good but not hot enough for me and if you tell them that they bring you this green salsa that is way too hot. Nothing in between. The food is great. I ordered the authentic tacos which where good. My wife got the pork tacos which she loves!! We will continue to go here for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican place. In town for a conference and was looking for Mexican food outside the city and I found what o was looking for. Spent $15 on the special #4 and it was a lot of food but it was all so good."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my parents here for dinner this past Saturday evening and I had to update my review because I simply forgot how amazing this place is!

Margarita the size of my face was absolutely delish and well priced in my opine! Easily the best house marg in Charlotte. 

We watched two different people order the nachos. The nachos are the craziest thing I have ever seen. A huge platter completely (and I literally mean completely) covered and then mountain piled up with all this craziness. This order could probably single handedly fill up 6 people. My hubby and I were discussing that our next movie marathon, we are gonna order this to go and be set the whole night!!

We started with the trio dip for the table. For $6, this is a great tizer option. The queso was delish and the guac was perfectly made!! My husband and I split the enchiladas mixtas and added rice and beans. Basically it is 4 enchiladas with a side of steak. Yes, you heard me correctly....a freaking side of steak!! All the enchiladas were fantastic. Do yourself a favor and split something here. We split and I still felt like I ate my body weight in Mexican

I left the evening with my workout for the day negated, an extremely full self, and my clothes smelling like Mexican (no joke). Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"I decided to go and try Three Amigos for the first time and I will be returning. I am very big on authentic food and I will say the food here is very authentic. I went on a Friday and was able to score the $5 Migareita special and ordered the Supreme Steak Nachos. Let me tell you that meal could feed a table of 4 and it was only two of us. The nachos were delish and cooked just right and my Migareita was pretty strong. The service was great and pretty fast."}
{"text":"I disagree about all of the positive vegetarian reviews. I am a lacto-vegetarian, and the manager there once told me that they put meat juice in their red sauce that they put on their cheese enchiladas. I dare people to prove me wrong!"}
{"text":"not impressed at all.  it very rarely happens, but my fellow yelpers steered me wrong.  took way too long for our food to come out (30+ mins), the queso was almost inedible and the entrees were VERY disappointing.  i ordered the ol' #1, aka - 1 taco, 1 enchilada and rice & beans.  i always order this on my first visit to a mex restaurant, because if you can't get this right, you can't get anything right.  it was bland and the only thing worse than the food was the portions (i stole that from woody allen).  

i would not recommend this place to anyone from out of town, because it falls very short of the mex you can find in other cities.  

my search continues for the good mex spot in the QC..."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte. We go here on a weekly basis. Cheap but awesome food and the service is always perfect."}
{"text":"Oh man. Three Amigos, you stealer of hearts and filler of bellies. Every time we go, we wonder - why don't we eat here EVERY MEAL? 

I wish I could say I've tried everything on the menu and loved it, but the truth is we always order the enchiladas. Always. And we are never, *ever* disappointed. When's the last time you honestly said that about, well, anything?

Go. Go NOW. 

Just don't take my parking spot."}
{"text":"service was horrible, my server was \"margarita\" (that's what recipe says, she never told me her name), didn't get not one single refill on my drink!!! (from her anyways, I finally asked another waitress for a refill). the food was prepared too fast to even get the bell peppers seared... I imagine the rest of the food was pre-cooked. (I got the Arroz con pollo). was edible tho, got a side of cheese dip to add a much needed addition to the dish, why they don't add it is a mystery. but to conclude my feed back, without customer service, u have nothing..."}
{"text":"Three amigos . For a small place they did a very good job!! The place was clean, the server was great!! The drink specials are insane!!! 
      Food- if your going there for salsa and chips . It was fair. Taste like they use tomato sauce in it. More like tex me  than mexican. But after that it was really good. I had the taco special. I like to order the crazy kind of stuff. So I ordered the tongue taco, pastor ,asada, shredded beef and tripe which they did not have so I got chicken instead. The hot sauces were very tasty.There was only two kinds. Food was hot, tortillas were also hot . I also ordered a tea and then I changed my mind to horrchata( I hope I spelled that right). A rice drink with a hint of cinnamon. It went great with the taco and reminded me of the small taco stands in Cabo in the city not the tourist area. I told the waitress I would pay for my tea. So she left it on the table. As I was about to pay , being stuffed for a great price. She said she would take the tea off the bill because I didn't drink it. Ok folks just this small gesture made a huge impression on me and how these servers take care of there guest. Just for the service alone I would go back. Now I read some other reviews about the service staff that were not that good. This server was new by a couple of months and knew how to cater to the clientele. Great job"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Three Amigos Mexican Grill and Cantina located in the Midwood area of Charlotte. Dora here. You getting tired of Midwood yet? I'm not. :) This restaurant located in a small strip center provides an ideal location for a quick drop-in lunch or a family get-together for dinner.

As part of an online app promotion, we started with a free Beef Empanada, a pastry shell turnover made by folding dough over a filling, beef hamburger in this case, sealing it, and frying it. 

This Empanada was great, fried golden brown, with a juicy filling including cheese. Dora here. And what a great start it was! Gooey cheese pocketed in the perfect crust. 

For the meal, I ordered the Fajitas De Camaron, shrimp fajitas cooked with onions and green peppers served in a cast iron skillet along with sides of rice and refried beans, delivered to the table, sizzling. The shrimp and vegies were tender, but I would have liked more seasoning to bring out the flavor. Be prepared for ginormous portion sizes. If we'd known, we could've easily shared.

Dora here. So hubby knows that I usually order fajitas at Mexican restaurants. At his prodding to try something different (I find it interesting that he ordered fajitas, don't you? What's up with that? :) ) and the server's recommendation, I opted for the Bistec Encebollado, grilled steak with onions along with rice and refried beans. And tortilla shells, of course.

In my opinion, this tasted much like steak fajitas and I would've enjoyed it with a bit more zest as well. Other than that, the tortillas, both flour and corn, tasted like they were made on site and the beans and rice were good. Overall, the meal was pleasant.

I would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.

{"text":"Love this place!

Definitely easy to pass by with out giving a second thought...don't do that!

Prices were great! Check their website before u go, they have kids eat free, 1/2 off desserts, and half of beers days.

love that you get free chips ad salsa (although the salsa is a bit thin)

prices were awesome and portion sizes are great!"}
{"text":"All you can eat enchiladas on Thursday were really good but didn't come with a side. 

I'll be back to check out more of the menu."}
{"text":"$5 large margaritas on a Friday night... nothing is better than that! 
However, the wait and the service is sometimes too much to bare. There really isn't a sitting area for those waiting, let alone a standing area. The waiting guests crowd the entire restaurant and make the experience less than desirable when eating. The servers are working so hard but its just so busy on Friday nights that they can't always keep up.
With all of that said, the food is sooo good. Classic Mexican food at its best."}
{"text":"Very unassuming from the outside, but do not simply drive by! Inside you'll find $1.50 PBRs, delicious homemade chips and salsa, and amazing burritos. Tons of local brews to choose from if you're into that."}
{"text":"Loved the food and House Margarita's are to die for Tacos were delicious def worth a visit"}
{"text":"Three Amigos is Okay.  I've been here about 4 times so far, at least twice with coupons. I don't have anything very bad to say, but nothing very good either.

The restaurant is very small and dive-ish which is kinda cool. I've had servers that were decent, but this past Friday night our server was horrible. She forgot the queso we ordered, our beers, and left us without water refills for way too long (which is just cruel when you're eating spicy salsa!)

The quality of the food is simple. It's definitely NOT hyper-processed and packaged... but it's not super fresh and top of the line either.

There's not a lot of vegetarian things listed on the menu, but they can alter most of the options to be veggie friendly by substituting zucchini, onions, and tomatoes. No special seasonings with the veggies, just chopped and seared. I don't like the refried beans. I do like the chips and salsa. The mole sauce is good.

On the whole, I might come here again, but Three Amigos is far from my first pick of Mexican fare. Thumbs up for being local and NOT a chain. But thumbs down for terrible service when they're busy and boring food."}
{"text":"The place is more expensive than I have thought.  But food quality is actually good."}
{"text":"Love the enchiladas!! They say they are their specialty & they're not kiddin! They have a full page of enchiladas. Everything takes incredibly fresh. Service & size leave alot to be desired  but the food (& portion size) is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Oh my! I think that this may be one of my favorite mexican restaurants in Charlotte. Everything about it was...dare I say...perfect? If you're driving down this end of Central Ave., you would never expect to have such fine Mexican cuisine. Let's just face it, it's not the best looking strip of road in Charlotte. If you've ever seen \"Bridesmaids\", and you remember the part when the ladies go eat at the scetchy mexican restaurant and they all get sick. Yeah, that's not this place! lol I had a deal through Yelp that I've been needing to use. $10 for $15. Great deal! When you sit down, you get these tortilla chips (like at every Mexican restaurant) but these are different! They have some kind of magical spices on them! I almost ate the whole basket, without salsa!!!! I ordered the camarones a la diabla. This is a dish I enjoy at most Mexican restaurants. Three Amigos does it the best. It arrived to my table steaming hot. It was so spicy (not overly spicy), which I loved. I also had a house margarita. It was huge! More than enough. Love this place! Great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Good food.. But very congested.. Actually that's ok .. Goes to prove the quality of the place !!"}
{"text":"Three Amigos is a hidden jewel on the cusp of Plaza Midwood. If you come here you will not be disappointed. They staff will make you feel right at home. The food is the best... The Mole is off the charts. If your live or if you are visiting Charlotte, you will definitely want to make a stop here."}
{"text":"Awesome place IF you order correctly, and last night it was mole heaven in my mouth. 5 stars for the experience last night which pulls up all the mediocre trips I have had there - the end game... I'm giving it a solid 4 stars. 

It's literally been a year since I have made a return visit because frankly I always left this place disappointed. Not a fan of their tacos (though I admit the tongue is pretty tasty even though not my personal thing) and I'm a taco fanatic which is a big reason. The other is that the wife and I always split plates and invariably we get one good dish and the other one not so much. Have long been in search of the perfect meal here until....

Ok, so not perfect, but pretty damn good is what I got last night. The key was that both entrees nailed it, and you guessed it - I didn't force the tacos for the one thousandth time. This place has some bangin' good mole sauce so I went with the enchiladas pablanas which were unbelievable; the lady went with the chilaquiles verde and this dish also nailed it with an egg on top cooked to perfection. And did I tell you about the mole (even I can make good tacos... Good mole, well that takes talent)? Granted there were some less than stellar items (the guacamole used some under ripe avocados and the tacos dorados appetizer was a waste of calories) but with two entrees like that and a cold Modelo, who really cares?  Glad I gave this place another try and I guarantee it won't be a year before I'm back again!"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing! We used to go there regularly because you could get dishes that you could not get anywhere else in town. However, They recently changed their menu, and now they are the same as all the other Mexican restaurants in town. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"I've been to Three Amigos about 4 or 5 times now. One time we had to wait over an hour for our food and the waitress that we had seemed like she was in a bad mood and didn't want to be bothered, never asked if we wanted more chips or more to drink, so she didn't get a tip, but it was worth the wait for the food. The food is always good and normally the staff is nice. I'd recommend this place to anyone who's a fan of Mexican food. Sometimes the place can seem a little cramped when there are a lot of people dining in, but still a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"I Love 3 Amigos in Huntersville. However this location sucks in service! thank goodness the food makes up for some of the horrible staff and possible language barrier with the waiter. He was very dry and not helpful. I wanted to get something different but he seemed in a hurry to not let me know any details on other food. I am totally disappointed with my experience. I left another Mexican restaurant and brought a new guest to come here based on the experience I had in Huntersville. Going forward I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant to get enchiladas. Verde enchiladas is superb! Homemade verde sauce with a lot of flavor, perfectly cooked rice and beans, and the chicken is always fresh and moist."}
{"text":"Going to Three Amigos on Saturday for a UYE was bittersweet. On one hand it was frickin fantastic but on the other, I've been in Charlotte for five years and never experienced this place before--what gives? 

I try not to judge a book by it's cover but sometimes you got to with restaurants and looking at Three Amigos, I really didn't expect much. I drove up and asked myself \"Is this the right Three Amigos?\" and as soon as other Yelpers came in, realized I got the right one.

What can I say that others haven't? Probably not much but the highlights
*Mexican Coca-Cola-this stuff rivals McDonald's Coca-Cola (aka the best Coke in the world)
*Tortilla chips fried to perfect with a bit of seasoning on them
*Guacamole so smooth and creamy that I wanted to break out some Gerardo and start singing \"Rico Suave\"
*Meals that could feed a small nation. Seriously. I ordered the chilaquiles verde with two fried eggs and feel like I could do some bicep curls with my leftover box. 
*Cheap prices. Said plate that could feed a nation was $5.99. What the hell?? I love it and again, sad that I haven't been going to Three Amigos all along.
*Friendly staff and owner--they kept stopping by, making sure everything was to our liking--the service couldn't have been more spot on
*People watching. Oh yes, it was good.

Now if they would have cardboard figures of Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short-I would be in heaven.

 Te amo Three Amigos!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good prices. Excellent service. Best Mexican food in the area. Chips and salsa are delicious. Make sure you try the cheese dip. Shrimp fajitas are my favorite. Plenty of leftovers or to share with someone else."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Margarita I have ever had and I bartended for many years! Great service and the food was fresh and delicious! I am from upstate New York and we do not have authentic Mexican restaurants, this was such a treat!!!"}
{"text":"As a fan of both cheap authentic Mexican and Enchiladas, I thought I would give this place a shot. First, it helps if you speak Spanish, because the menu is all in the native language. If not, you can figure out that pretty much everything comes with some variation of queso (cheese) and salsa/mole (sauce).

Yes, there are also traditional enchiladas and tacos and such, but I was more intrigued by the colorful new combinations.

I asked for the best of the chicken enchiladas, and they delivered. The meat was shredded well, and it meshed with the combination of salsa verda, cheese and avocado. A very green dish, and it didn't weigh me down afterward. A very nice price, too: $4.50.

The location and ambiance is nothing spectacular down on Central Ave. near the Vietnamese places, but it's a good place to try a spin on an old favorite for not that much money."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are complimentary and amazing. I also had enchiladas with mole sauce and they were incredible. Love the atmosphere and service. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Quick recap: absolutely delicious. By far my favorite overall Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. Tacos, carne asada, and enchiladas are all absolutely on point. Small location so be prepared to wait a little. 

The wait however is worth it. As usual there are chips and salsa to begin which are better than most places. But that's where the ok ends. The carne asada was rich in flavor. The beans and rice are always delicious. The tacos are well made and the guacamole is also better than most. 

The superstar at this place are the Enchiladas Verdes. The sauce for this dish is pretty much as good as it gets. It's a heft dish so bring your appetite. 

Drink specials are usually great and the atmosphere is amazing. Again, bring your appetite bc this place is actually on point on pretty much all levels."}
{"text":"My first Three Amigos experience was pretty positive. We sat outside - I didn't even see the interior. They have a small seating area in front with about 6 tables. They're quite small. The outdoor setting isn't the most ideal - a parking lot on busy busy Central, but that's ok. 

They have just enough vegetarian options, but there's certainly room for more. I'd be thrilled if they offered a core veg protein like tofu to add into burritos, fajitas, etc. I got the fajitas and they were pretty good. They come with on a steaming plate piled high with veggies, and another plate with rice (VERY overcooked), beans, lettuce, and avocado. Wish it had been guacamole but again, not a big deal. Only downside to fajitas is you smell like fajitas for the rest of the night!

We didn't get any drinks, but their margaritas are enormous and clearly well-enjoyed by the crowd."}
{"text":"Terrible doesn't even cover this experience! 

To start the ambiance was gross with crumbs on the floor. They only have a 93.5 rating & that must have been when they were expecting the inspectors!!

Chips - corn grainy texture that sticks in your teeth! Not very good. The Dip- Thick, only ok. 

Empanada with cheese, onion, zucchini, & Cilantro- Awful!! The first one came way too salty not edible and the second came with sand that grit in my teeth. 

Shrimp Quesadilla - Edible, but not good! 

I will never be back!! I Would Not Recommend This Place At All!!!"}
{"text":"This place was introduced to me by a friend and I was surprised by how delicious it was!  I love it for all the reasons people have already mentioned here, but I gave it three stars for a few reasons.   

I have gone back a couple times, and most of those times were VERY loud!  If the TV wasn't blaring, it was the internet jukebox.  I understand the music can add to the atmosphere, but straining to hear your friend across the table at lunch time isn't the most fun. 

There do seem to be things lost in translation here, and, as someone mentioned, the service can be a bit shy.  I have had my order messed up every time I've come here, but it almost doesn't matter because it all tastes so good, haha. 

It's a shame because I LOVE their food, but I have to be in the right mood to go there because it isn't always an easy dining experience."}
{"text":"CRAZY good food, drink specials, not cheap on giving you a TON of queso with your meals/apps, and the chicken nachos are INSANE!!!...Seriously, picture a serving plate for Thankgiving with a nice big turkey on it; thats the size of the chicken nachos u get, loaded with white chunk chicken, cheese and everything else you'd want PLUS big slices of fresh avocado..For $7!  I'm a big dude and i can only eat 1/2 of it and take a shitload home. Staff has always been friendly and tho not speedy fast not as slow as some here indicate (seriously have you ever had lightening service at a mexican restaurant consistantly? If you've ever been to Mexico the pace is just a little slower than here and i think that feeds over)....I'd give it 7 stars if i could!!"}
{"text":"YES it is that good. Best margaritas, awesome service, great tacos, and delicious seasoned chips. The location isn't necessarily what you might expect but they are always busy and if you are looking for great Mexican you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Enchiladas Poblanas are the reason I keep coming back.  They are delicious, as is the guac.  

I thought I'd share this Charlotte gem with coworkers today and have to say that the takeout experience is NOT a good one.  It's Saturday, we're having to work, so we wanted a good lunch.  We ordered, what we thought, were orders of lunch enchiladas as well as a large guace, queso fundido, and chips and salsa. Drove the 20 minutes one-way to pick up the lunch and were charged for full, dinner portions.  It was 12:15 in the afternoon, website clearly states 10:30-2:30 lunch specials on their menu.  

Asked the girl checking me out why we were charged so much for lunch and she explained that they don't offer lunch specials on Saturday.  Fair enough, great for future reference, but I asked them to honor the lunch special rates as they website does not have any specifications and I wasn't going to pay the extra for my office.  

She was super nice and offered to check with someone (manager I presume) and came back and said they would honor it.  Great! Awesome service.  

However, they had to re-do our orders so she took them to the back and I guess they changed them to lunch portions, as they came back out in smaller boxes (no rice/beans, just three enchiladas).  That's fine, I don't care if we get what we pay for, but I'm on a lunch break  time crunch.  Again, she was very pleasant throughout the process, it just seemed silly to waste the food, boxes, and my time. 

I get back to my office and deliver lunches to everyone.  We have one bag of chips, one brown paper lunch bag of chips.  We ordered a LARGE ($8!!!) guacamole, a Queso Fundido ($5) and chips and salsa.  I wasn't aware that I had to order \"Chips and Guac\", \"Chips and Queso\", etc.  in order to get enough for those portions of dips.  

Very disappointing to have a large container of the tastiest guac, but nothing to eat it with.

Food is good.  Service is spotty but today was great. Deals/promos are shady and/or unclear.  Value is bad."}
{"text":"Nice cheap Mexican place. Their salsa was awesome."}
{"text":"We went for lunch during the week. I ordered the enchiladas verde and my husband ordered the four tacos. My enchiladas we amazing with a homemade green sauce. My husband ordered 4 taco plate and had more food than he could finish and enjoyed them all, chicken, al pastor, shredded beef, and carne asada.  The homemade chips and salsa were fantastic. We had 2 sodas and a bill under $20. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"It was such a bad experience. Food didn't come at least 1 hour and server was in bad mood or not but it was such a weird. Plus restroom was bleached middle of the day and still nasty smell. 
I'll never ever go back there."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. I had three different  enchiladas with mole' sauce. I had chicken, pork, and beef tongue. It came with rice and refried beans. The mole sauce is so complex. It's spicy & sweet. I love spice and this sauce was everything!  I regret not ordering a Margarita because I saw a few ladies drinking them & they looked so refreshing. Also, I got a free beef empanada & it was probably the best I've had. That says a lot too since I've been to Mexico a few times.

The chips & salsa was a nice bonus. The chips were nicely seasoned & the salsa is obviously homemade. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a gem we happened to stumble upon while escaping the incense filled interior of the pho place across the street. I often lament the lack of good Mexican food in Charlotte, but no longer. 

Veggie chimichanga was filled with diced zucchini, onions and peppers. Perfectly fried and topped with cheese sauce and a salad of lettuce, tomato and avocado. So filling I could only eat half. 

Husband had the carne asada and said it was the best he'd ever had. High praise from an extremely critical foodie. It was thinly sliced, seasoned and tender. 

The salsa is good but the cheese dip disappointed. Thick and flavorless and cold. After reading the reviews, I realized I should have gotten the queso fundido. Next time..."}
{"text":"I LOVE MEXICAN FOOD! The food here isn't like most of the Mexican that I have eat before but it is still really good. I am a very picky eater and still enjoyed it, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Be sure to \"check in\" with yelp and get your free empanada! Also worth noting is under \"Dominican Favorites\" is the entree called yaroa. Yum! Our waitress was absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"Damn you Three Amigos...I knew it would happen if I saw you, but still I had to try. Replay 1 hour before dinner decision... 

Wife...let's have Mexican tonight. 
Me...Eh. 
Wife...What? Three Amigo's is good and cheap. 
Me...yeah, but I always overeat at Mexican restaurants 
Wife...So don't eat everything on your plate 
Me...I can't help myself, I've tried. Those damn combos kill me. 
Wife...laughs...you have a problem 
Me...at least I admit it 

1 hour 28 minutes later, I'm full after chips & quac (good guac!) and my chimichanga \"combo\". So good...so much food...and only $8. Add in a large margarita and bottle of beer and I am full. Yep...did it again. I left some rice and beans for whoever took my plate though. 

Three Amigo's is a great spot in Plaza that has a few small tables and a wall of booths. Don't be afraid of the so-so strip mall exterior, this place has great cheap food. It's also open until 4am on Friday & Saturday's. Good lord, if I'm there that late I know I won't have any room left from the night's PBR's, but as I know, I'll still stuff my face with good Mexican food. Damn you Three Amigo's! :)"}
{"text":"I dont know where to start this place is good. The chips are excellent the salsa is fresh and the food is excellent. Big portion sizes so bring an appetite if eating the combinations and if your hungry but not starving, order a la carte."}
{"text":"When I thought it wouldn't get much better than La Unica in the affordable Mexican category, I found Three Amigos - it was great! Everything is very fresh. You can get your typical beans, rice and burrito meal here, but it's also really easy to make a very healthy meal. I ordered the Tacos Pastor (amazing flavor!) and got a side of guacamole instead of beans and rice, at no extra charge. Their guac and salsa are some of the best I have had. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We were in town for the race and craving Mexican food.  Found this place on Yelp and went for it.  Glad I did.   Good stuff and great service.  
Will definitely be back next year."}
{"text":"Obsessed!! I have been three times in three weeks!!

The Queso that they have is my favorite and I could have it with every meal!! It has Chorizo and Sauteed onions in it YUM!! I have had a different dish each time I've been and I will say that they all have been really good! The Carne Asada is my Favorite as of right now but  that will change in the week I'm sure!

The servers are really sweet and on top of my Margaritas!!

My FAVORITE Mexican in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"It's okay, I felt sick after eating here so I'm not a fan. We order queso here and it was really loose. I think the only thing I really enjoyed were the sides and chips."}
{"text":"Ridiculous amount of guacamole for the price. The enchiladas were also great. I'd recommend getting the mixtas so you can sample four different kinds"}
{"text":"There was a roach on my face. Probably the grossest experience I've ever had. My friends and I tried this place out after a recommendation. Now I'm recommending you never go here unless you like roaches on your face or your food. After waiting for almost 2 hours to be seated we were given the worst service. I felt something crawling up my neck and I thought it was my hair a little to find out that it was a roach crawling on my face I flicked it off and screamed --immediately walking out of the restaurant disgusted!! After some time calming myself down outside. I walked back inside to get my money back and give them and ear full only to see another roach crawling up the wall. So there you have it. Good luck if you choose going here. When you go inside make sure you look up."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Best little hole in the wall Mexican I've had in Charlotte. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious! Awesome salsa! I would drink it if no one were looking. The girls are very nice and the margaritas are just about perfect. There was really nothing that could have been better. Go try it! Get a lot of salsa..."}
{"text":"How have I not done a review of this place before???  Actually, I was planning on a 3 star review due to my last experience and assumed I already had given them 5 stars prior.  Pretty much my go-to Mexican place in Charlotte.

Its been a while, since Sabor opened, I've gone the \"fast food\" route.  When a group of 5 awesome lady friends want you to join them though, you don't say no.  They didn't have a table for 6 and a couple of us had other things we had to do so we broke the group up into 2 tables.  First I ordered some nachos that never came.  No biggie, that was more for the group of 6 anyhow.  We ordered our food, they ordered there's.

The food for our table came out.  I got the arroz con pollo.  They forgot my tortillas, so I had to ask for some.  I had never gotten this dish here before but it was more like chicken fried rice from a Chinese place with avocado on top.  I ate it though.  A pretty nice sized plate of food, although slacking on chicken portions.  Our table actually finished our meals before we went to go visit our other table who still hadn't even gotten their food yet.  We ordered more beers, paid our checks and then went back over to the other table.  Still no food, not much in the way of apology either.  Since a couple of us had other places we needed to be, they eventually just asked for their food to go.

I'd honestly give this a 1-2 star if this was my only visit.  I know what these guys can do though.  I hope my next visit is a little better."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican I've had in 15 years. I ordered a enchilada/taco lunch combo. Bland bland bland food that they decided to dump a gallon of green chile sauce on top of in order to mask the blandness of it all. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"What a great spot.  Definitely the best traditional Mexican place I've found in Charlotte.  Really unassuming and absolutely zero pretensions about it.  Relative to the atmosphere on a Friday night, I quote the famed song 'lip gloss' when I say - 'It's poppin', it's poppin.'"}
{"text":"This place was excellent!!! I had the fish tacos. Delicious! They also serve craft beer."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious dinner with my wife here the other night. It's a hole in the wall but the food more than makes up for the size. Chorizo cheese dip is good as well as the steak tacos."}
{"text":"I'm here from Houston working at uncc for research...after nearly a month of no mexican food, I brought my parents here since they made the 18 hour trip to see me....after seating ourselves...our waitress spoke to us in spanish. Spanish??? really? I rolled it off even though it was quite annoying. The chips and salsa came...the chips were decent enough-nothing to rave about but the salsa tasted like ragu meets some cilantro and onions. It was terrible. I ordered enchiladas which weren't awful my father dined on the mole which had the same sauce as my enchiladas....bland at best. the only thing that made my enchiladas worth it was the queso fresco that topped it. The beans were more of a blob...nothing special- the rice was fairly decent. Everything on my plate lacked seasoning. My mother had no complaints about her meal but she's nicer than I am. The waitstaff was nice...they are a bit lax but coming from Houston I kind of expected it...after my remarks about the salsa they promptly brought us different salsa which fit more of my expectations. Overall it was ok...nothing special not good enough for 4 stars...maybe I showed up on the wrong day...or maybe I'm just used to better mexican food."}
{"text":"This has become our favorite Mexican place in Charlotte (really no comparison). This is the only place we can go, get a couple beers, app, and 2 entrees plus tip and come out under $25 bucks (and have leftovers!). They have great beer specials almost any day of the week. The queso fundido with chorizo and carmelized onions is a don't-miss. Used to always order a la carte (try the beef tongue tacos!!) until I discovered the Shrimp Quesadilla. It's AMAZING!! Shrimp is high in quality and quantity and buttery delicious. Super cheesy also!!"}
{"text":"I've decided that every return trip to Charlotte should be marked by a visit to Three Amigos. This place is a legit little Mexican cantina on Central with solid food and quite good drinks.

I tend to avoid giant Margaritas (bad tequila experiences in my youth) but they're serving up some good ones here that are definitely a must-have. 

As for the food i'm definitely a fan of the Enchiladas; particularly the Enchiladas Rojas which have just the right amount of spice without being completely overwhelmed by tortilla and beans like at many Mexican spots. 

The service has been hit and miss. The staff are very nice but they tend to disappear for a bit after you've gotten your food (I'm still waiting on my water).

All in all this is a great little place and all the positive reviews are not far off."}
{"text":"There are few aspects of this place I was impressed by and few not very much.
Positives :
House chips and salsa were Bomb , best salsa I've had ever . Horchata was excellent . Tacos de pollo were alright but the rice that accompanied was the best part ,I am a huge fan of Mexican rice and not all places get it right .
I told the waitress that I have checked in on yelp and asked for the free Empanada which was also pretty good with crispy pastry and cheesy chicken filling .Fajitas were excellent and could easily be shared among 2 people

Not so positives : Service ,none of the waiters seated us for the first 5 minutes even though there were empty tables.
Place itself was cramped and there was food all over the floor and the waitress charged us for the Empanada which was supposed to be free .
What made me uncomfortable was a particular \"group\" of diners that did not looked OK to be stepping out in public and clearly acted weird to whom any other restaurant would have denied the service . Its a shame that I dont see myself going back here despite their excellent food."}
{"text":"The chicken in the tacos is shredded and high quality and the corn tortillas are amazing.  Love their warm chips and thick salsa and the guacamole holds its own with the best restaurants in town due to the freshness and simple, clear flavors.  The churro dessert was also a fun if somewhat heavy finish to a very reasonably priced meal.  

They don't speak completely fluent English so be patient. It will pay off. The menu has pictures, which means you could even get away with pointing and smiling!  Booth seating is super cozy and the bathrooms are clean.  House of Enchiladas rocks!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to some delicious Mexican food based on fellow Yelpers, but was disappointed. The restaurant itself was small but welcoming and the customer service was amazing. The food however not so much. The chips we were served were cold but flavorful and the salsa was very bland. We ordered the nachos with chicken as an appetizer. Once again there was a lack in flavor but the pulled chicken was tender and moist. For my main dish I had the chicken burrito, taco, and beans and rice. The taco, beans and rice were decent. The burrito was made with refried beans inside which threw me off, and it lacked flavor. My dining companion had the fish tacos which he said also lacked flavor. Overall I was left underwhelmed. The food was nothing to rave about. I would return for the margarita I had, which was made perfectly, but not for the food."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place,for a while! Tried it tonight,and boy am I glad I did! The salsa verde was on point. The chips fresh and margaritas, FANTASTIC!!!! It is a hole in the wall, but sure hope it stays for years to come!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, great food, great service.
I love coming here, but it's small inside so if it is busy be ready to wait.
Coffee has sugar and cinnamon- if you actually like coffee try it."}
{"text":"Quality place with consistent food. Our go-to mexican restaurant in the CLT."}
{"text":"This is my favorite comfort food restaurant in town. Crave it on a weekly basis. Well priced options and delicious burritos!"}
{"text":"I had been to a Yelp event awhile back that had food from Three Amigos, so I knew before I came to the restaurant that they have good food.  So, recently when I dined in for the first time for Chad's suprise party, I discovered that they have good service here as well. 

This place is on the small side but popular and known for good food, so even on a weeknight, the place is busy. Still, even as busy as they were, our servers took really good care of us and really hustled. 

My favorites here included the Chicken Empanadas, chips & salsa, jalapeno salsa,   queso fundido, and churros.  I was not a big fan of their guacamole - too much onion for my taste. 

For my entree, I ordered the Enchiladas Poblanos - which consisted of 3 tortillas filled with chicken and  Mexican Mole Poblano sauce topped with cheese & sour cream.  This was served with beans & rice.  Sadly, the mole was not the most delicious that I have ever eaten, but it was ok.  I probably will order something different next time I am here.   I thought the rice was a bit on the bland side and I am not a huge fan of refried beans.  Next time I will probably skip these items.

I also tried a bite of the Chicken Enchiladas Verde. It had a bit too much onion for my taste, so I probably wouldn't order this dish here next time either. 

But, they have plenty of other options, so next time I visit, I will definitely check out some of their other offerings.   The prices are very reasonable here, our bill for 2 entrees was under $20 before tip."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole!  I love this restaurant, I have already written a review and proclaimed my love, but I want to spread the good word on this new name page too.

I went in last night after an afternoon at the Thirsty Beaver, it was better than normal.  I couldn't believe it, sometimes you love restaurants but it looses it's charm after a couple of visits, not this one.

I had never ordered the queso, it had sauteed onions and chorizo. I might have to get that every visit.  It's tiny, the perfect amout for two people.

Then BORING, I ordered what I always order, enchiladas verde.  I can't help myself. If you like hot stuff, call me.  no really, make sure you ask for their hot salsa, it taste like pureed hot peppers and avocado blended. It will light you up, just like the Thirsty Beaver.

Don't forget to order imported Coke with real sugar."}
{"text":"I came here for a late dinner on a Wednesday evening with the hubby and an out of town friend in tow.  I was already in a good mood after beer tasting at the common market and I figured this would be the perfect time to try out Three Amigos.
I was already expecting a hole in the wall kind of place from all the reviews.  The dining area is set up much like a fast food restaurant with laminated plastic booths lining one wall and a few tables in the middle of the floor.  A quick glance at the number of customers gave me a boost of confidence that our food would come quick because we were all starving.  Unfortunately, the service was terribly slow.  It took quite a while to explain what we wanted to our waitress (she was baffled by the fact that I wanted a beer and my husband did not).  Once we came to an understanding we still had to wait for quite a while for our food to come out.
The food was pretty good.  I got some chicken enchiladas with beans and rice.  The ingredients all seemed very fresh and the dish had just the right amount of spice to it (I like it hot!).  Everyone at the table seemed happy with their food.
I want to come back and give them another try to see if the service is any quicker.  The quality of the food is definitely good for the price."}
{"text":"Holy moly guacamole! Tonya P. & Nicole W. introduced Dion L. & I to the deliciousness that is Three Amigos today. How I haven't been here before is beyond me, but wow, I'll become a regular now.

First off the chips: Seasoned & crunchy! There's nothing worse than soggy, soft chips...no fear here!  And smart Tonya got us an order of guacamole - FRESH guacamole. Nice sized tomatoes & cilantro & good consistency/texture of the avacodo.

$5.00 margaritas on Friday? Why not!? They're huge & so refreshing, but had just enough tequila that I was one & done.  Poor Dion was headed into her big girl job, so she couldn't enjoy any. :(

I went with the four steak tacos off the lunch menu...but you can order them with chicken, too. And of course, I got the cilantro & onion, which was heavily piled on. I'm cool with that!  Both were fresh, the onions a little too fresh; even after partaking some yelp mints, I'm still tasting onion. :D The steak, was in small tiny pieces & tasted SOOOO good! Wow, I was so impressed.  Normally I'm used to the steak in tacos being the skinny strips of steak, so Three Amigos way is much better.  It was seasoned nicely, too.

Other notes: Prices are very reasonable, place is clean, & service was exceptional.  

Cons: It's pretty small & parking is extremely limited."}
{"text":"All I can say is this place deserves all of it's rave reviews.  I got a little taste awhile back at a Yelp event but I had yet to stop in for myself and experience what this place really has to offer.  

The menu is extensive and has all your traditional Mexican favorites like tacos and burritos.  DO NOT  leave this place without trying the enchiladas.  I decided on the Enchiladas Rojas I think I made an excellent decision.  Most Mexican joints I've tried in the area if I order enchiladas I get a big plate of greasy cheesy goodness with some unmemorable sauce.  Not at Three Amigos the waitress asked if I wanted my red sauce spicy (she must know me)  this was the most delicious enchilada sauce I've ever had it had a really nice kick to it.  $8.99 three huge enchiladas and after all my chips I took two enchiladas home and had dreams about them all night.  They were just as good the next day.

As you can see I highly recommend Three Amigos."}
{"text":"I lived down Central from Three Amigos for about 2 years. Let's just say that I could never have frequented this place enough. It's a perfect shining mexican flagship for the Plaza area. Nestled in a dive-y little strip (thus, parking can be a bit of a problem on busy nights) and quaint/understated. Three Amigos is definitely a go-to for authentic Mexican in Charlotte. 

The pros outweigh the cons tenfold for this place. The only negatives to report, which I'm pretty sure everyone has experienced, is the service. You might wait for a half hour for your app/entree or MUCH longer with no whisper of timeframe, and its iffy you'll be able to communicate a need for a swift dining experience. This can be a bit annoying for some diners. I'd recommend hitting up Three Amigos when you've got some time to kill. This place gets SLAMMED, too. Kick back and take advantage of the humongous margaritas. 

The food is to die for. I've never had better queso fundido. Definitely worth the $4 to pair with the fresh salsa and chips. We heartily enjoyed every last drop and even used what was left on our entrees. 

Bistec a la Mexicano was incredible. So many sautéed veggies and perfectly seasoned steak with rice and all of the standard Mexican accouterment. So much on my plate it was hard to consume all of the goodness in one sitting. My compliments to the chef on this dish. Incredible flavors. 

Un Chile Relleno will make you melt. The only thing I could say is that I wish it were \"Dos\" Chile Rellenos. Filled with amazing cheese and avocado. 

Prices are rather fair for the level of flavor and execution. Love this spot in Plaza. Whenever I crave Mexican, Three Amigos is what I think of first. ¡Ole!"}
{"text":"absoultely delicious! seemed  very authentic. i stopped here while on a road trip and it was definitely worth the ten minute drive off the freeway,"}
{"text":"Eating at Three Amigos has the feeling of going over to your uncle's place for dinner...you know, if your uncle happens to be a fabulous Mexican cook.

I came in and was greeted by a supremely huggable woman who gave me a basket of freshly made chips and salsa that smacked of cilantro. When I said I didn't want a drink, she asked again, this time in spanish.

I decided on the Enchiladas Poblanas. They came with a rich mole that hinted strongly but did not scream of chocolate, and were topped with just the right amount of sour cream and cheese. The shredded chicken inside was super flavorful and not at all overcooked. The rice was mild but not dry and the beans were tasty. The waitress came back to check if I really didn't want water twice during the meal.

The food itself was amazing but it was made all the better by the laughing, dancing and general warm atmosphere that accompanied them. The whole shebang came to about $10 with tip.

Oh and next time I go back, I need to try one of those substantial margaritas made from the assorted bottles of liquor stashed on the random piece of furniture behind the counter. I mean, it IS within walking distance of my house."}
{"text":"Eat here!  

One week before I leave charlotte for most of the year and I FINALLY got around to eating at Three Amigos...and I was so happy!  I'll be in Arizona for the next two months, and I wonder if I'll be able to find more authentic mexican fare than this.  Perhaps more authentic, but more delicious, I don't know.  

The table chips and salsa was just how I like it, the salsa kind of watery and the chips hot and salty.  (I don't like chunks of salsa, I just like to coat the chip with salsa flavor as opposed to actually eating the peppers or onions, which don't agree with me.)

I didn't try the margaritas (I was driving) but I kind of wish I had because I love them. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Entomatadas, which is \"3 tortillas hand made with cheese and Mexican sausage, lettuce, tomato and sour cream served with rice and beans\" (according to the menu).  It also came with some cut up avocado.  The enchiladas seem to have been covered in red sauce, and the enchiladas are only filled with the sausage, and sprinkled with a bit of cotija on top, and finished with a drizzle of sour cream.  It was all buried under lettuce and tomatoes so I'm not entirely sure WHAT it was but I am sure that it was G-D delicious and I gobbled it all up.  The rice wasn't like any mexican rice I've had, being full of peas and carrots and corn like Chinese fried rice, but it was really good.  I wasn't a huge fan of the beans (I still ate them all, though, because I am a fan of beans and cheese in general.)  

Service was good, the room is pretty small.  The 'La Belle Epoque' painting in the women's bathroom was amusingly out of place, but kind of endearing.  

EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is authentic as you'll get in Charlotte. I judge that mostly by the way the tacos are served in traditional Mexican style(cilantro, onions, meat, limes).

Also, they have craft beers and drink specials all night. 

Note...This is Plaza Midwood, not Myers Park, so more divey than richy...

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food, make sure to try the empanadas!!  From the outside it doesn't look like much, but this is definitely a local hot spot."}
{"text":"Three Amigos successfully combines the best of Mexican dishes for American customers and \"down home cooking\" for the Mexican patrons in one cozy setting.  The place is quite unpretentious-the focus is on the  food and quality service.

I've been several times and enjoyed the carne asada tacos immensely.  They serve them on flour tortillas with onion and cilantro. The chimichanga is quite decadent: a fried burrito with melted cheese.  Unlike alot of Mexican restaurants, the menu is not complicated with lunch combinations of more of the same.  You can skim the menu in 2 minutes flat and get an idea of what's good.  And yummy dinner entrees for less than $10 are worth yelping about.

Helpful hint-They bring bland gringo salsa with chips.  Upon request, you can try three more spicier salsas.  The spicy avocado rocks, albeit in small doses!  Its all made IN HOUSE!  I think that when I establish rapport with the staff after several visits, they would be willing to make some avocado sauce with a little less kick.  

The word \"flavor\" sticks out in my mind when I think about Three Amigos.  Don't believe me, try it yourself."}
{"text":"Moved to the Charlotte area from California and I'm still looking for good Mexican food. Figured I'd give 3 Amigos a try based on yelp reviews. Very nice staff and menu with a decent variety. Their salsa has lots of flavor and is very mild. I ordered their lunch poblano enchiladas. Food was good, not great. After a few bites though, there was the biggest cockroach I've ever seen crawling on the wall. That definitely killed my appetite."}
{"text":"I didn't like my food- but, that was my fault bc I didn't read the ingredients carefully on the menu. I wasn't going to say anything about it to my server, Patricia, bc I didn't want to be THAT customer; plus, it was my fault. Patricia wasn't having it. She could tell by my facial expression that I wasn't feeling my food and offered to make me a special order to go. I was thoroughly impressed by her attentiveness and kind gesture. I'd go back just for three customer service!"}
{"text":"Located in the Plaza Midwood/Merry Oaks area, this popular Mexican spot seems to have a pretty loyal following around town these days.  I am definitely a fan of Three Amigos, but if I am being truly honest with myself, 2/4 of those stars might be due to the fact that this Three Amigos location is within walking distance of my house...     

Don't get me wrong, the food is definitely good, just sometimes, I find that it can be a little on the bland side.  For example, I got a large order of guac recently, and although it was teeming with fresh tomatoes, onions and cilantro, it still required a good salting to give it anything close to flavor.  Although I've tried my different items, my go-to entree is the Steak Burrito Special.  Its your classic, monster burrito stuffed with rice, steak and smothered with melted queso-cheese.  Very good, just can't call it great.  Once again, the actual burrito only contains rice and steak - no peppers or onions, no cheese, no guac, no sour cream - not much inside the actual burrito to add much needed flavor.  As a result, I find myself salting every bite!  The shrimp fajitas are good and are served with plenty of big (though tough), grilled jumbo shrimp, rice and beans as well as peppers and onions.  

Despite what you get, everything is very reasonably priced and is a great value considering the amount of food you receive.     

Although, I've only actually dined-in at Three Amigos three or four times, the service as always been great.  The servers are always super polite, friendly, and accommodating to whatever your specific tastes may be.  I do however order take-out from here very frequently.  My order has always been correct, and it was always been ready within the time frame they gave me.  

Oh and parking can def be tight on Friday and Saturday evenings in the small plaza Three Amigos is located in.  

I'l def be back, probably later this week....food won't knock your socks off, but its good enough value to keep me a fan!"}
{"text":"Was referred here by many friends who raved about it. Tried them out at the beginning of April and came away disappointed. My order was incorrect and had to be thrown out. It was a busy Friday when I picked up the order.  When I tried to call about the order I didn't get through. I sent a fairly detailed email through the contact information posted on their site an never heard back.. Spending $25.00 a meal that was thrown out was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Our first time there- Delicious food! It was busy, around 6pm on a Saturday. We were seated immediately and the service was great. Quick and friendly service with a smile. 

I ordered the chicken burrito which was smothered in cheese. My boyfriend ordered the nachos which were huge- enough for 2 or 3 people to share.  The large house margarita was a steal at $7.50, delicious Margarita. He loved the salsa but I didn't eat it. 

Only down side is that it was super hot- not sure if the a/c was broken but the thermostat on the wall said 81. I would've stayed for another drink but left after eating because it was so hot in there."}
{"text":"Got here on a Monday...it was packed for a rainy night with sleet & snow falling...I have been wanting to come here since living in Charlotte.... So glad I come today because I'm moving out of state this week...Well the staff very friendly ...my waitress was HOT! ok let me talk about the food I got a free Epanada for checking in on yelp..I order the highly reviewed Carne Asada  ....and my waitress suggested it over the Enchilada order I was thinking about ordering.. I'm so glad she did.. the steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection..... I am glad I had the opportunity to try this place out before I moved away from Charlotte"}
{"text":"Loved three amigos. Had a taco, enchilada, cheese dip, and chips. The taco was the absolute best. Loved the queso and beans. Can't wait to eat here again! Authentic food, decent prices and greatttt taste. I picked up the food Togo and it traveled well. Parking was easy and service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Autentica comida mexicana, las enchiladas mixtas son deliciosas, y las flautas son la perfecta botana (entrada)"}
{"text":"Super delicious and friendly staff. The food came out faster than expected. I will be returning and must bring people with me."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of 3 amigos!  They were completely empty on a Saturday afternoon so I got to sample sauces prior to placing my order which was very helpful as I am very indecisive by nature:-)  The chips and salsa were delish and the queso dip was amazing!  I finally decided on the Enchiladas Verde with chicken and steak(the steak is much better than the chicken imo).  The portions are quite large, so expect to feel like a stuffed pig as I did upon departure."}
{"text":"Great little autho-Mexico dive on Central Avenue.   Ordered a heaping pile of veggie fajitas.   OMG so much food.   Sizzling hot and yummy corn tortillas.   I'll be back with friends."}
{"text":"I mean not the best joint, so it's okay... I had the Enchiladas Verde which was decent... maybe I'm not really into the Green sauce... unless it's the Taco Bell Salsa Verde... I know I know... it's Taco Bell, but it's still good.  

When I checked in I got an offer for a free Empanada. I was psyched because my friend ordered one and shared and I was in love. It was perfectly folded and stuffed, cheesy with seasoned chicken. It's funny because my free one looked like they dropped it on the floor and decided to give that one to me since it was free. 

It was a nice lunch spot (not many lunch specials), so  I can say I gave it a try, but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The enchiladas poblano (mole) will change your life. Seriously! After spending a Sunday at Carrawinds, my family and I were famished. With a party of nine, we wanted something good, filling, and inexpensive. I whipped out my phone, pulled up my Yelp app, and searched for best Mexican restaurant near our current location. Thank you sweet Yelpers for sending us to this place! The restaurant space is on the small side, so we had a bit of a wait. Luckily there were a few available chairs at the bar and a few empty seats on the patio. The men opened bar tabs and sipped on brewskis while the waitresses cleared tables and made space for our large party. Once seated, our drink orders were promptly taken. Shortly after, drinks were delivered and food orders were immediately taken. Everyone enjoyed their meal! I accidentally ordered the wrong sauce for my enchiladas; since I was starving, I decided I would just keep them. After a bite or two I realized the sauce was far too spicy and acidic for my palate to enjoy. I called our waitress over and apologetically explained that my enchiladas were too spicy to enjoy. She, without hesitation, said \"Don't worry! I will bring you the correct enchiladas. There might be a wait since we're packed. Is that okay?\" I replied yes. Thinking it would take a while to receive my new dish, I decided to enjoy my rice and beans as I waited. Not even five minutes after removing my old dish, the waitress returned with freshly prepared enchiladas. Holy MOLE!!!! :)

Whenever I'm in the Charlotte area, I will be sure to return. The food is fresh, authentic, palate pleasing, affordable, and the customer service is great! That's a four-star visit in my opinion. And judging by the other comments, my fellow Yelpers agree!"}
{"text":"I was expecting more of a \"sketch Mex.\" type restaurant but I was pleasantly wrong. Not that sketch mex. doesn't have its place but three amigos falls into a different category. It's small first of all, not much space but the staff utilizes it well. Chips were seasoned which was different and salsa was tasty. I asked for the spicier salsa as well and was brought what I believe to be a jalapeno paste of some sort. We ordered guac. and it was very good. I wish I had been there on margarita night but the drink special was Modelo. At three bucks, that's not exactly what I would call \"special\" but it was cold. I had a steak enchilada and although small, very tasty. Overall a good experience that I would like to try again."}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews of this place, I figured I would give it a try. My overall experience here really was not that bad, but there were two lacking imperatives for Mexican dining that really bothered me: 

1. Chips, they weren't hot and we had to beg for more. 

2. Drink refills, they didn't exist. Mexican food is salty and honestly, I need like three refills to get through a meal...Also, their soft drinks come in cans!!?!?! (refill cop-out). 

Just my opinion.."}
{"text":"The chips/salsa awesome. LOVE the seasoning on the chips. The margarita's AMAZING. 5 stars on that. I checked in on YELP with my smarty tarty phone and received a free queso. Delicious. I ordered a standard Burrito. Super yummy and cheesy.  There was an accident later that night with my left overs and I thought I might cry, I was really looking forward to eating those. Guess Ill just have to return! 

I would recommend this place to anyone that loves or even just likes Mexican food. 

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5... My friends were slightly put off by the location (aka they brought they're valuables inside with them) but I thought it was fine. The communication was slightly difficult because it seemed our waitress's English was borderline and my Spanish is muy malo. Also had a groupon which caused to be slightly problematic.."}
{"text":"Mexican with mole, in Charlotte? Sign me up. Turns out it's delicious? I'm stoked. 

My favorite mexican in Charlotte, by far!"}
{"text":"My GPS dropped us in on this gem of an eatery. $1.50 PBRs and awesome food and service. Love the fresh ingredients and homemade crunchy taco shells. 

Will definitely be back. Have no idea where I am but my GPS does. Will have to favorite this stop. 

Thank you 3 amigos!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible! The salsa tastes like plain tomato sauce no flavor or spice at all. Very Americanized Mexican food. The service is just as bad as the food. Don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"Delicioso! It has been a while since my husband and I last visited. Since it was Cinco de Mayo yesterday, we thought we needed authentic Mexican cuisine. We were so happy we went back to La Casa de las Enchiladas!

They recently updated the place. They installed a bar right when you walk in. It looked like a good addition. They changed the menu since the last time too...it now reads in English for those of you who need the translation. 

The food was great in taste and in portion! Service was fast and friendly (in Spanish, but also there was staff who spoke English). They serve breakfast all day long and they open at 10am (my kind of breakfast time). 

If you haven't been here yet, go soon...and often!"}
{"text":"Three Amigos Restaurant is a little place that I'm happy I found!  The food was excellent, and their Margaritas are the best I've ever had!
I will definitely return to Three Amigos!  The waitstaff is friendly, and food was brought out fast!"}
{"text":"Three Amigos is special for several reasons:

1.) You can tell that everything here is made from scratch from the best ingredients they can source because everything is absolutely delicious. Chips are on the house, but try them with a side of Guacamole, it is the best I've ever had! For the 1st two years after I discovered this place, all I ate were the Enchiladas Poblanas. I LOVE Mole, in fact, Mole Poblano is the national dish of Mexico and is very intricate and difficult to make, but Three Amigos kicks its butt! The flavors that come out of their mole are so intricate and layered. It is such a perfect combination of spicy, sweet, salty and tart that you cannot actually taste those individual flavors because it just becomes this whole new amazing combined flavor that should have its own name! Lately though, I have been addicted to their Quesadilla de Lengua, or Tongue Quesadilla. I know the thought of tongue scares some people, but in Mexico, Central, and Latin American we have been cooking with it forever, and Three Amigos has it down to an art. There is no other cut of meat that I can think of that can have such a tender texture. If you do not want to commit your whole meal to tongue, order a tongue taco on the side, and you will never look back. Also, on Fridays and Saturdays from 10pm-4am they serve a Dominican menu. It is all greasy, delicious, Dominican street type food and if you've had a little too much to drink I cannot think of a better place to get something to eat and sober up!

2.) I discovered Three Amigos about 3 years ago, when you barely saw any Americans in there, and it was fantastic. A short while later they put out some daily deals and to say the least, word spread like wildfire. Unfortunately, in my experience, when such a significant spike in demand takes place some restaurants get overwhelmed and start cutting corners and buying pre-made ingredients. I was very worried that this was going to happen to my beloved Three Amigos, but if anything, the opposite took place. They rose up to the challenge and continued to do what made them famous in the first place, and that is to serve authentic and delicious Mexican food in an incredibly friendly environment.

3.) The final thing that makes Three Amigos special is the fact that aside from serving delicious food, they go out of their way to help customers create unforgettable memories. I've had a couple of birthdays here and my husband and I had our joint Bachelor/Bachelorette pre-party dinner here exactly a year ago and Three Amigos is not only accommodating, but they go above and beyond any expectations that you may have. I dream to one day own a restaurant like this, that is not only adored and remembered for the food, but also for the memories they helped create!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here and consider myself a regular. My very favorite item on the menu is the margaritas! They are the perfect blend of tart and sweet with the smokey tequila taste in the background. Delicious!  The enchiladas are to die for and I also like the fajitas. The service is good, even on busy nights. This place got 5 stars because they really have the best authentic ingredients that I look for when craving Mexican food. I have yet to find another eatery that can compare to Amigo's mole and chili sauces. Well Done!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican spot near plaza midwood area. We started with queso, chips and salsa. Be warned: if you order plain queso they will charge you 4.49 which is the same price as the queso with the chorizo so go ahead and go for the upgraded queso. We both got chicken chimichangas and they were really good As well. I have had chimichangas that were fried but these seemed not to be. They are topped with queso, lettuce, tomato and avocado. The ingredients are very fresh and I really appreciate that. Margaritas on Friday are 5$! Check in on yelp and you get a free empanada which was one of my favorite things. It's a fried tortilla stuffed with chicken and cheese."}
{"text":"Extremely small restaurant. First thing I saw while waiting for a table was the servers scooping tea and salsa out of a dirty cooler. They keep water in plastic containers which I found strange. The salsa was not spicy at all and lacked overall flavor. I ordered a combination and the server failed to tell me that a burrito is the size of my head so getting more than one is unnecessary! Overall I was not impressed at all."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for lunch! It is a great spot! The food was AMAZING we got tacos and got a side of pico and guacamole, the guacamole was very fresh and had a great taste so did the tacos.

The environment was also nice, we had a booth in the back so it was nice, I mentioned to my girlfriend that the temperature was perfect. It was too cold like most restaurants or too hot. I really enjoyed it. And the servers were great! She had a great attitude and was very professional!"}
{"text":"The service here sucks!!! Love the food. But why is everyone else getting served before us. 35 min no food . Our waitress has an attitude."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! A must go. Super friendly staff, great booze and even better food. Expect to wait about 20 minutes for a table for dinner. Lunch is a bit faster. YUM!"}
{"text":"This was OK but I don't get the hype. The chips were thick and chewy/bulky. Salsa was good. I had steak tacos and it was all on the dry side..."}
{"text":"$5 house margaritas to kick start your weekend.! 
This place was crowded and we waited 10 mins (at the bar) to be seated. Really enjoyed the music, ambience and the food. 
Authentic food with refreshing margaritas. Definitely a place for a Friday evening"}
{"text":"I really dig this little (literally) spot. Don't let the surroundings wig you out. Three Amigos is on point. Check out their awesome *giant* margarita specials on Friday. Are you a hot head? Ask them for their extra spicy green salsa. So good! Expect a wait during busy times but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my husband and was surprised at how small the space is! It is super close to the new place we are living so it is really convenient and we had read good reviews. The chips have some spice on them which I wasn't used to seeing at these sorts of mexican places but don't let that bother you, you can hardly taste it. We were really pleased with the salsa, it was pretty standard. The rest of the meal was good, nothing to write home about but exactly what you would expect. We both had the bean burrito with cheese sauce on top and a side of rice. We were happy with what we got and will come here again as it is close to us but I have had other mexican in charlotte that I enjoyed more."}
{"text":"The salsa they serve is probably the best i've had at a mexican place. I had the mole enchiladas. It was a a lot of food."}
{"text":"Don't ever order take out here unless you really dislike yourself.   An hour wait is standard protocol.   Staff has no clue!"}
{"text":"This is one of if not the best Mexican restaurants in Charlotte! I've eaten in and done take away. The food is always hot and fresh. Staff is attentive. Margaritas are delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is the bee's knees! Best guacamole in Charlotte! The chips are made fresh and are seasoned making them so delicious you could eat them by themselves but the salsa is also amazing! I ordered the steak chimichanga. It was good but not as crispy as I would have liked and it was filled with more rice and beans than steak, I'm used to them being more cheesy with the meat and peppers and onions inside, so next time I will ask to hold the rice and beans. My bf ordered nachos, a taco, and a burrito. Claimed he was starving and didn't even get through half of it because the portion size of the appetizer nachos was huge, enough for a stand alone meal. He loved all of his food. Also, you get a free empanada for checking in on Yelp how awesome is that! We will have to redeem ours on the next visit because the food we had ordered was more than enough."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican place in Charlotte. Favorite menu item pollo mole. Yum, yum! Second fav is the flan. So good! My only sad face is no unsweet tea. Everything else is perfect!"}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place before I went that I figured it had to be hyped up a bit, but alas it was not at all!  The decor is whatever, but really that is not what I come here for.  The delicious food at ridiculously low prices is the main draw.  I love the queso with onion and chorizo to start, chips can sometimes be mediocre, but are usually pretty good.  I've tried a few different enchiladas and they were are drool worthy.  Tried the vegetable chimichanga last time and it was excellent.  The rice is always so moist and fresh.  They have drinks specials daily and the basic margs are pretty good.

Overall you walk out of this place feeling fat and happy and the wallet is not much lighter!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since they opened.  I have had some wonderful meals and some barely edible meals.  No consistency at all.  Very high turnover in staff for whatever reason.  You never know what you are going to get.  They have been open long enough to have figured it out.  Enchiladas are normally very good.  Authentic tacos are good and consistent.  Simple is better.   Hard to recommend.  Sam P."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch to meet up with some work ladies. It's pretty easy to find with a big sign and right off Central Ave. The interior is cute and pretty small. We waited a while for them to seat 5 of us and service was a little slow even thought they weren't busy. 

The margaritas are really good. I ordered a large not realizing how big it would be, so it was definitely worth the money. The food was decent and the portions are really big. We all ordered from the lunch menu, but they charged me $3 extra just for shredded beef instead of ground beef which they didn't tells me about beforehand. I don't think I'd make the trip back but it was good for a one time experience."}
{"text":"Jalapeno Sauce the consistency of Mustard!  This Sauce gets Five stars for flavor!  Be careful this is pretty HOT!  We were adding this to every dish only in small quantities.

Lets start at the beginning!  My Amazing new Girlfriend likes Mexican food, might be her favorite food so when I asked POPROCK LOVE for a place the five of us could meet for a early Labor Day Dinner, she chose this place without hesitation - I have been wanting to check this place out!

My Girlfriend and I arrive and POPROCK LOVE and her Husband had a table for all of us...This is a fun place to meet friends and hang out!  We had a taste of a non-Margarita Drink (not not,mic mic, nick knack know what it is called) Grapefruit juice? Something?  It was good!  Good enough that one taste cured me!  If you think that is funny you should have been there when it happened, if you do not think it is funny read again and check your sense of humor, It's funny! 

The Chips were Exceptional and the Salsa was very good!  I'm usually not a fan of much Guacamole, Guac seems too mild for me, yet I like the oiliness of it!  This Guac with a little of the Jalapeno Sauce was good enough that I bet everyone else at the table was wishing they had invited my Girlfriend to eat without me.. I ate more of it than the next two people combined and I was not hungry! Great start! !  ! 

My Girlfriend got something like an Enchilada and something like a Taco.  I liked the \"Taco\" better... Since we have not been dating that long and Mexican is not a cuisine that I am that familiar with, I wanted to eat what she ordered... One of our friends who will remain nameless (you can call him Alejandro from Ecuador and he is from Ecuador) gave me half of his meal (something like delicious PORK wrapped in a soft shell with Onions and Cilantro) This was VERY, Very Good!

Is it a Hole-in-the-Wall?  Kinda, Not to me, because it is plenty Clean though about what you would expect for the address!"}
{"text":"***DISCLAIMER****
I'm from California, where there is no shortage of tasty Mexican food.

With that being said, I really, really enjoyed the Roja enchiladas.  Deep, rich, savory sauce really ties the dish together.

The other enchiladas I tried were so-so.

It would be best to pair the enchiladas with a tasty Margarita (or cold Mexican beer) and you have yourself an afternoon delight."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. 

I was sitting enjoying a refreshing margarita Friday night in the small patio they have when all of a sudden I saw what seemed to be an employee and a regular patron walking out to the patio. I closely heard the conversation as I was sitting right next to the door and what came of the employee's mouth completely shocked me and couldn't believe it. 
The woman talking to the gentleman said that he and his friend were BANNED from this restaurant because they had previously left a bad REVIEW! 
THEY CAN'T BE SERIOUS!!!

The lady said those were orders coming from her general manager from what I thought I really want to meet the manager because she's just out of her mind. 
I've been coming here almost every Friday for the margarita special but after tonight I sure won't be coming back as they might also ban me from reviewing them."}
{"text":"So, I base my mexican food experience on the chips and salsa mainly, and I must say that they have some of the best that I have had in CLT.  The food is standard menu items of enchiladas, burritos, tacos, fajitas kinda thing.  I had the fajitas which were completely overcooked and a bit bland, and my friend had a burrito which got an \"ehh\" shoulder shrug.  I need to take these chips to go and then get my entree at Azteca.....happiness"}
{"text":"Best Mexican i've had in Charlotte. Chorizo Queso is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ok so, I went here on a date.  This review is long overdue as I'm no longer seeing said guy, but whatcha gonna do.  Yes, this is a very unassuming location, but don't let that fool you.  The food is delicious.  I had the enchilada special and the taste was phenomenal.  I tried pork, beef and chorizo and am hard pressed to pick a fav.  The accompanying margarita was also potent and good (though nothing special, but still good).  The chips and salsa were also on point.   The perfect thickness and kick to the salsa. 

Ok for rating this five stars I wish I could write more.  But simply put this is the best Mexican I have had in Charlotte.  Note it isn't approaching best of all time...that goes to La Rancherita in Quad Cities, IL.  That spot is the one thing I miss about the Midwest."}
{"text":"The wait staff was attentive and active. I dined on a Thursday evening. I read google reviews before I came here but if the drinks and cocktails were good, I was assuming the food was good too. I ordered a vegetarian chalupa and it was delicious and smothered with cheese and the guac was amazing."}
{"text":"My rating is solely based on the service. I ordered food to eat-in but it took close to an hour to be prepared, so I changed it to take-out. Haven't tried the food yet."}
{"text":"MY GF found this place on Groupon, and we went there before the Asobi Seksu show at the Visulite. I'm a fan of Mexican sandwiches, so I ordered the Torta Cubana (refried beans, lettuce, tomato, carne asada, hot dogs, chorizo, bacon, avocado, sour cream, and eggs). It didn't disappoint. I have a HUGE appetite, but was only able to finish half of it. Although I've long said that La Unacia has the best tortas in town, I think this one is slightly better! My GF ordered the enchiladas rojas with cheese; the actual enchiladas themselves were fine (no better or worse than any other Mexican place), the SAUCE was simply AMAZING! It was so complex, it nearly mimicked the layered spices of Indian cuisine. We will absolutely come back, although the wait time for the food was a bit troubling: 35 minutes seems like a LONG time for a Mexican place!"}
{"text":"Food is AWESOME at great prices. Establishment could be a little cleaner. We went on Mother's Day and ate like queens, but the place could've been a little cleaner for dine in guests."}
{"text":"Three Amigos will be probably one of my top 5 Mexican restaurants in Charlotte! Tucked away in the Plaza Midwood on Central Av, this restaurant is a less than a 10min drive from downtown/uptown. Ambiance is a not really a thing for most of the restaurants on Central Av, owing to the limited space I guess so. The restaurant had a couple of booths and tiny tables. I am an average person at about 160lbs and the small booth was pretty cramped for me. The menu was regular Mexican with not much house specials or interesting innovations. The only surprising thing on the menu was it had an \"All day breakfast\". I have hardly known any Mexican restaurants in Charlotte serving breakfast menus! 

While We ordered some Fajitas, Quesadilla, Empanadas and Chimichanga, we were given chips and Salsa. The chips were fresh and tasted so much better and the salsa was a die for! The dishes came in after a short wait while they were still smoking hot! The quantity was lavish and not too overwhelming. The food tasted heavenly! Everything from the mexican rice, beans and even pico had so much flavor to them and were not bland. We truly enjoyed a good Mexican dinner! 

I would recommend Three Amigos to all Amigos looks for good tasty Mexican food without puncturing your wallets. I would have given 5 stars but the ambiance and the small tables were a let down."}
{"text":"Everyone - STOP going to chain \"Mexican\" restaurants. Just stop. Right now. Really. This place is great - the tacos, the fajitas, the everything is super tasty. The staff is friendly, the drink specials are also good. If you are looking for something that isn't a generic chain with generic food, then search no further.

I highly recommend it and am SO glad we finally found a Mexican place in Charlotte! It's our new go-to."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Mexican food in Charlotte! On Fridays they have huge $5 house margs. The portions are enormous for the price you're paying. 100% worth it."}
{"text":"Food served til 4 AM?! Umm yes. This is a great place to go after a club to soak up all that alcohol you drank there. Honestly, I went here twice. Once, I don't remember clearly but the faint memories was delicious! At late night though, they only serve Dominican sandwiches. No worries though, they're delicious.

I had a nice house margarita and an awesome 'Rickis' sandwich. The cabbage gave it a crunch which differs from the other sandwich. The 'Churris ($5)' instead has one beef patty instead of ground beef and onions. I tried the 'Churris' last time I was there and faint memories said that it was amazing, but then again I will have to try it sober to remember the exact details.

I will definitely come back more often, because it's just a great place to just hang out. Not that many people come through so it's quiet to talk. Most likely though, I'll be coming here after the club before I go home."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place a 3.5, but for my initial review I'm going to have to leave it at 3/5 stars.  The location on Central Ave is pretty convenient, although this is too far east to still be in a nice and urban area like Plaza-Midwood. The shaded and verdant, albeit trash strewn, briar creek greenway is next door if you want to take a walk afterwards.

Some of the other reviewers claimed that the waitstaff hadn't yet mastered the English language, but I was disappointed to find that their English skills are impeccable (I wanted to practice \"mi Espanol!\").  The service is a little slow, but the servers were nice enough to make me feel relaxed enough to not want to hurry.  

Another Yelper said that you need to ask for the picante salsa if you don't want the mild gringo stuff, but the one they brought me wasn't hot either and didn't taste good at all.  Kind of like taco bell's chipotle sauce but more burnt sandy taste.  The regular salsa was good and the chips were great.  Our neighbor's guacamole looked fantastic.

The tostada was fine, but not too special.  My GF really really liked the fajitas, which I also found tasty, but they were a little lacking in the fajita spice flavor that I was expecting.  She said that she only wants to eat fajitas from now on when she goes to a Mexican restaurant (so it does have the ability to please).  I also had an enchilada that was pretty good with pretty decent sauce too.  The best of all was the chimichanga which had a nice thin tortilla which made it so that it wasn't too oily or rich.  Combined with the meat and beans and queso fresco it was superb.

I could easily give this place more stars, but honestly it wasn't as good as I was hoping.  My collegiate years in San Diego have certainly spoiled me.   It's pretty tasty, reasonably priced, and has good enough service so I recommend checking it out.  But it's not quite as \"sabroso\" or \"rico\" as I was hoping."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and so fresh tasting!  I ordered the enchiladas rojas. It was spicy, which I love. I had plenty of leftovers. Great deal for the price! I would recommend this to anyone:)"}
{"text":"Taco salad & churros con helado - amazing! I loved the queso fresco and rice in the taco salad. Service was fast & attentive the last time, very nice & polite. 

The churros con helado came with strawberry ice cream and has been by far one of the best desserts I've had in a restaurant in recent memory. Will definitely be returning for the amazing taco salad & churros!"}
{"text":"I went here again to give this place another try well two years later to be exact and I can tell that this place has really stepped their game up. I was quickly seated the chips were piping hot and the salsa was tasty. I ordered the vegetarian chimichanga  a la carte and it was simply out of this world and pure bliss not to mention it was priced reasonably and very filling!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give Three Amigos a try after a certain amount of recommendations and reviews about the place. I visited on a Tuesday night with my friend and surprised at how small the place is! It's a true hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant.

We ordered the (small) house margarita and I found it to be a bit bland. I didn't get much flavor or 'oomph' from the drink. I've definitely had better margaritas. 
We were given the standard complimentary salsa and chips and I ordered a small portion of the guacamole. The salsa? VERY good and the chips were slightly seasoned which provided a nice flavor. The guac was good, it tasted very fresh but nothing else that was of note to remark about.

I ordered the enchiladas de horno (chicken enchiladas with cheese, onions, cilantro and avocado) which came with re-fried beans and rice. I loved the portion size of the enchiladas. They weren't your standard oversized portion found at other Mexican spots. My biggest problem with the meal was that parts of the rice was overcooked. Like, crunchy bits of rice which is a big downgrade for me.

I've had better Mexican food but I'd definitely give Three Amigos another try!"}
{"text":"I was looking for some good Mexican, and the Yelp reviews all (mostly) pointed me here, which is a good thing since it looks a little sketchy from the outside, and I never would've gone without seeing it here. A friend and I ventured in on a Thursday right after work, and we were the first ones there at 5:30; by the time we left around 7:15, the place was hoppin' with mostly yuppies and families.

Our waitress was so nice! We started with the queso fundido ($4.49), and it came with chorizo and onions - a new thing for me, but delicious. We both got the tacos al pastor ($8.95), and they were superb! My friend wanted them to be a little spicier, but I like mine sweeter, so I was all set.

Great food, great service, inexpensive - a fantastic trifecta!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Three Amigos. It's our go-to Tex Mex spot. I almost don't want to review it because I don't want everyone else going there and making it hard to get a table. But, that would be very un-Yelper of me. So, I will tell you...

The drinks are well poured and well priced. The chips are spiced and delicious and the salsa is fresh and FULL of cilantro (YUM!!). 

It's hard to pick a favorite entree. I love the fajitas mixtas, but I also adore the enchiladas verdes. My husband's favorite is the enchiladas al horno. He's also a fan of the chimichanga. 

We loved sitting outside on the patio with our pooch. They were very cool about allowing him outside with us, even among the sizzling plates."}
{"text":"La Casa de Las Enchiladas is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. I really like the steak burrito, which comes covered in queso sauce. You can try to order takeout, but it doesn't really work out unless you speak Spanish. It's best to go in and eat there or order food to go and wait."}
{"text":"We were worried that we would Never find real Mexican food here in Charlotte. The tacos are amazing and the service here is great!! So excited that they are just down the street."}
{"text":"Returned a few weeks ago on a Friday night. Service was great and food was cooked well. Had the same dish and the steak was tender and not too salty."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful, pre-Steely Dan concert meal here. The dishes on the menu are influenced  from Guerrero state in Mexico (e.g. Tinga is from that region). There were also a few items that appeared to be Dominican. We ordered chicken mole - which was delicious and authentic, not the kind of \"instant\" mole that I often (unfortunately) encounter in Mexican restaurants - and Tinga, which was also very tasty. The house Margaritas are large and good value, too. We can't wait to come back. I wish we had a similar restaurant in Columbia, SC..."}
{"text":"We haven't been here since they changed the name to Three Amigos, but dinner was great tonight! Joe had the chicken mole and I had some basic enchiladas and a taco - all excellent. Also they had Dos Equis on special for $2.50! They lose one star because the salsa was not the greatest... and you have to order pico de gallo but it's worth it - very spicy but so tasty."}
{"text":"I have to say that this was the worst $45 I've ever spent on a restaurant.  

We spent $45 on an iced tea, two cans of Coke, which they advertised as bottles (no refills-I'm comfortable with the no refills, but honestly expected something interesting like Coke made with cane sugar from Mexico at $2 a bottle).  We also had cheese dip, which reminded me of the unfortunate time I made the mistake of buying the microwaveable cheese dip in the grocery store for a quick, easy app.  We had the mixed fajitas which had mushy vegetables, were overcooked and dry and a bit \"over-caramelized.\"  My partner had the shrimp tostadas.  Both were bland and had nothing authentic about them, more importantly they were lacking ingredients advertised, such as sour cream. Just when you thought it was impossible to mess up tortilla chips, there's were burnt, reheated, and stale.

I've traveled throughout Latin America, lived in Spain and Mexico, and along with my Hispanic partner agree that my mother-in-law would never put any of this food on her table. It was just poor, disappointing, and i feel sick at my stomach from this food.

Whether it's been a five-star restaurant or a taco truck, I've had better food elsewhere and I'm greatly disappointed at the value for the price paid. At no point, even after seeing our barely eaten food, did the server ever ask if everything was okay.  

I wish that we had left once the plastic, buttery wax of a bowl of cheese dip arrived..."}
{"text":"Have to do a quick update for my favorite Mexican spot in the city. Dalton, and the crew at Three Amigos offered to host my company holiday party this past Saturday night. All I have to say is Three Amigos continues to impress.
Out of 13 people, my wife and I were the only ones who had ever been here so I was very excited to show my co-workers some great, authentic food. 
We arranged to be served family style for such a big group and everything was perfect.
Started with pitchers of margaritas, a few beers, chips, salsa, queso fondito (chorizo & onion) and their incredible guac. 
I had asked specifically if they would make us some empanadas off of the late night Dominican menu and boy am I glad I did. They came out next, stuffed with either chicken or beef, they were incredible. 
Then came huge platters of rice and beans, followed by enchiladas served with either rojo, verde, or mole sauce. All 3 were incredible. Also served was Bistec ala Mexicana, which is basically a Mexican beef dish, served in a sauce of tomato, onions, chili, and a few other veggies. That stuff was amazing!!
They finished up with desserts from a local Mexican bakery, Las Delicias, (which will be reviewed as well).  We had a full Tres Leches cake, flan, and guava empanadas. 
The staff was amazing, and very accommodating, especially considering we got a little loud towards the end of the night. (Patron shots will do that to ya)

Big thanks to everyone at Three Amigos, you have forever won me and many of my co-workers over for best Mexican in the city."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Homemade salsa and chips was delicious. Had chicken chimichanga. Would recommend to any lover of Mexican food. It is real deal!"}
{"text":"This place is FOR SURE worth a shot!  Nestled in a somewhat sketch plaza down Central a bit, you may miss it if you're not paying attention!  I actually found it via other Yelpers.  Always drink specials and food specials most nights!  All-you-can-eat Enchiladas on Thursdays.  Very well priced.  $13.50 for mixed grill fajitas- nice sized shrimp, chicken and steak!!!  Very generous portions... My roommate and I shared one meal after discovering the big quantities on our first visit!  We stopped in the first time on a Saturday night.... FREE Bingo starting at 9:30pm!!!  We won gift cards and free \"Three Amigos\" shot glasses!  Yum chips and salsa, $2 tacos EVERYDAY!!!  Great, affordable Mexican food!"}
{"text":"5 stars from me. Amazing Mexican food. Your typical hole in the wall spot/setting. I wasn't worried about whether the floors were really all that clean or not, esp during prime time. If the food is good enough to impress an authentic Mexican(my gf), then it must be good right?! I love Mexican food, and a lot of Mexican spots don't serve pollo en mole which is surprising, you must try it! The tacos are always good, and the tortas are better than most other places. Nothing negative to say about this place currently. Will keep coming back here."}
{"text":"I think this is some of the best Mexican food in Charlotte. 

Go for the fajitas mixtas ($14) which come with steak, shrimp and chicken, plus peppers and onions, rice and beans, and all the trimmings. There's usually enough for me to have some for lunch the next day. 

The mole sauce for the enchiladas is delicious, too. 

I generally go for a Modelo or a Dos XX, but the house margarita is popular with all of my friends. 

Heads up: the restaurant is small and can get crowded. Last time I was here was a Saturday at 2:30 and there were only two open tables. Order a drink at the counter and wait. Or, if you're in a rush, call ahead and order takeout and eat chips and salsa at the bar while you wait."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the best Mexican food in Charlotte. I don't care if I wrote a different review earlier giving another restaurant this superlative...this restaurant is THE BEST. They've recently changed the name and changed owners, but the food is the same high-quality, authentic Mexican food. The waitresses sometimes struggle with speaking English, which can be a little problematic when you are trying to convey that you don't want meat in your dish - but if you're a carnivore and you can just point to the menu item, then go for it. 

While you're there, try the Mexican Coke. It's got real sugar in it instead of the high-fructose corn syrup...and it tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Ok... So I eat here WAY too much and may be slightly biased as it is pretty much \" in the hood\" but people for those of you who were saddened by La Unica's passing:  BE SAD NO MORE!!!  This place is the real deal taqueria... It's not pretty, it' plenty divey, it's small and the ac can be dicey but it is (as Granny used to say) Goo-ood.  From the beer selection and Margaritas to the chips/salsa and the ENCHILADAS you cannot go wrong!!!  The service has been getting better bit by bit over the years and now (perhaps cause we are regulars) it is a-ok most nights.  Cheese dip with chorizo will make you Hap Hap happy and indifferent to the fact that your arteries are clogging and if you are a big mole sauce fan then this one's for you.  

Get a big margarita and at up y'all!"}
{"text":"A little dive-y and the service can be slow, but the food is delicious. The first time I came here, it was about closing time, but they managed to whip me up a huge (special order, since I don't eat rice) burrito. I was drunk, no longer hungry, and very happy. 

On my second trip, I headed over for lunch and enjoyed their enchiladas while my husband got the fajitas. Yum and yum. 

Third trip was with my British mother-in-law. The Brits aren't terribly familiar with margaritas, so she had never had one outside the bucket style mix. This one knocked her socks off. I tried a ginormous Dominican sandwich and she had... something delicious, I don't really remember. Extra chips & guac all around. 

Now, I want to go back. My husband has beef bourguignon braising right now and all I want to do is run off with my Mexican lover, Three Amigos. I dream of refried beans."}
{"text":"\"Jefe, would you say that I have a `plethora' of piñatas?\"
\"Oh, sí . . . . \"  

The Three Amigos.  The name conjures up images of Steve Martin,  Chevy Chase, and Martin Short--three clueless unemployed actors in Mexico who have no idea what they've gotten themselves into.  Likewise, I didn't know what to expect once this place had changed hands, but it turns out I like it a lot.   

I'll echo everything that Julia S. has said and add my own 2 cents. 

I fully believe that the food at Three Amigos is actually better than it was at Casa de las Enchiladas.  My friend ordered 3 different kinds of tacos à la carte (beef, pork, and chicken) with a side order of pico de gallo to lovingly tuck them in before devouring them and sending them to Hell.  She loved them.  The meats were savory and seasoned well, and they came wrapped in aromatic corn flour tortillas.  The pico was spicy, fresh, and the cilantro and lime juice were popping--better than before.  

I enjoyed a very nice order of pollo en mole with rice and beans and washed it down with a bottle of coca-cola made in Mexico.  Yep--sweetened with good ol' sugar and not high fructose corn syrup.  (google Dr. Mercola if you want to learn what HFCS can do to you.)  Thanks to Chad E for the mole recommendation.         

I didn't try the bar, but I'm thinking the next time I'm in there I'd like to wash the food down with a Corona.    

We have no complaints except for the dueling juke box and stereo system.  That was a little disconcerting.  

I hope you'll visit this place (AND see the movie).  Three Amigos has two more amigos as of today.  

I'll leave you with this quote: \"Hey!  He's using real bullets!\""}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I splurged today calorically and we ordered the loaded nachos but with fries instead of the chips.  I have to say their nachos are much better than the fries (go figure!) but the fries were really decent too.  I think their toppings taste better with chips versus the fries.  

The reason I gave this place 5 stars is because they have the best chips in town and everything I've gotten here has been excellent.  Even though the loaded fries were not my favorite, I set a very high bar for my loaded fries, this is still a great place to get them compared to many others.  (After all, I can't just give my 1 favorite loaded fries to that restaurant...no other restaurant will ever get 5 stars if that's the case!). They still give a ton of toppings and their carne asada is among the best in Charlotte.  

Everything else I've ever gotten here has been great!  We will keep coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh hell yes. Finally ventured over to Three Amigos, why haven't I been here before? It's magnificent. 

Vegetable tacos, howwwww do they get zucchinis so flavorful? HOW? And serving each taco in two corn tortillas? Amigo, you're talking my language, and that's the language of love. Rice and beans are good too, not just fillers to be looked over. The enchiladas al hormo were topped with an unbelievable avocado/cilantro sauce that I could not get enough of. The amount of food they serve for the price, fantastico. 

Also, they serve the best orchata I've had outside of California. For serious. I want to come back, every day."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Perfect little hole in the wall with amazing food and great service. I visit charlotte every weekend and stopping in here is always a must for me! Portions are generous and such a cozy atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"WOW I love this place!  Yep it is in a little shopping center off Central.  Small bar and dining area but service is quick and friendly.  I have had a variety of dishes here.  

The salsa that comes out when you first sit down is my fav of any mexican place in town.  Not to watery and not too chunky - just right!

The margaritas are HUGE and the perfect refreshment on a sunny day.  The enchiladas and taco salads are plentiful and just the right amount of spicy.  

There are TVs around and the wait staff is so sweet they have let us change the channel if we are looking for a specific game.  So sweet!

Love it here!"}
{"text":"GO! Just go.........and make sure that it's on a Friday. 
Why? Grande sized house Margaritas are $5 each. 
I always drink two, because they are Fergalicious!!!
Be warned.....they are both delicious and potent, which are both good things in my book. After two 'Ritas yesterday, I had a little trouble walking for a second or two. 

Other random thoughts.....

WIBBLY WOBBLY
My initial booth's table was so wobbly that it wasn't possible to eat at that table. I asked to move to an adjacent booth. My waitress complied with no comment, other than a smirk. If that table had been a horse, ala 1950's westerns, \"they\" would have shot it in the head to put it out of it's misery. 

MARGARITA
Secondly, you ARE going to want a second Margarita. Even though they are large, my first one was almost gone before my food arrived. How large you ask? I got in a pretty good arm curl workout drinking those 'Ritas. Curl. Sip. \"Ahhhh.\" Curl. Sip. \"Ahhhh.\" Repeat. Feel the burn!

The Amigos' Margaritas are made with freshly squeezed lime juice, good tequila, triple sec, lime and orange slices, and a ton of salt on the rim. My waitress, who was also serving as the bartender, showed me their placard as having been selected Charlotte's BEST Margarita. The two that I had were the best in recent memory, so I don't dispute their claim. (They are also made QUICKLY!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/three-amigos-mexican-restaurant-and-cantina-charlotte?select=xVPIVNwRtkg83jlm2N_2aA

GUAC ME, BABY!
A MUST is ordering their chunky guacamole with pico de gallo, because it is amazing! I always get a small, appetizer size, portion to go along with the chips and salsa. I have never eaten better guac. The appetizer size is plenty for one, but for two or more people you'll need to order a larger sized portion. 

CHIPS, AND SALSA, AND GUAC.....OH, MY!
Oh, speaking of the chips and salsa....the chips come out warm and covered in some type of red spice. They are good.

The salsa \"appears\" to be homemade, and it is filled with bits of onions, tomato, and chiles. I have not had better gratis salsa anywhere else. I usually add a little hot sauce for good measure.

TACOS
Entree: I ordered the TACOs AL PASTOR today for a change. They were just \"okay.\" Three Amigos scrimps on their taco filling as it is, but there were only one or two pieces of pineapple in both tacos. The flavor was also not as good as their charcoal grilled tasting carne asada tacos, which are very good. I still have not found an entree dish that has blown me away yet, but I'm still hopeful. The carne asada tacos are $7.95, and the tacos al pastor are $8.95. Both are too expensive for the meager portions received compared to other places. 

To offset that a bit.....the refried beans and yellow rice are wonderful. I cleaned my plate, which I rarely do in a Mexican restaurant. 

SERVICE? 
Usually good to excellent.

ATMOSPHERE? 
Loud! The Hispanic music here reminds me of an 80's Latin disco dance party. This place rocks! There is Tele-MUN-DO comedies on the TV, which get funnier and funnier as the margaritas accumulate. 

CUANTO CUESTA? 
Expect to pay $20+ per person, IF you go full tilt boogie and order a little bit of everything, including a couple of grande margaritas. 

I like to splurge once in awhile without worrying about prices. I used to go to a good steak house, but more and more lately I find myself craving tacos, great guac, and grande margarita(s). Maybe I'll see you there next Friday."}
{"text":"Three Amigos is situated in a strip mall in a not-so-inviting stretch on Central. Despite appearances, we gritted our teeth and entered Three Amigos.

Chips and salsa: delicious
Menu: Not too extensive. I was especially wary because there's a section called \"Mexican Fast Food\" or something that highlights quesadillas and tacos...the enchiladas, though, are the restaurant's self-proclaimed house specialty. I went with Enchiladas al Hormo with vegetables instead of chicken or beef (**Vegetarian side note: All the enchiladas have the option of coming with veggies instead of meat. Delicious**) -- best enchiladas I've ever had.

Will definitely go again.
OH and drink specials every night. We enjoyed $2.50 Coronas."}
{"text":"A no-nonsense joint that (Mexi)can deliver exactly what you need without the fluff and cost of more fancy places.

The margaritas are strong, flavorful, and tangy. Not the best I've ever had (that would be Tommy's in San Francisco), but it can hold its own.

I got the chicken fajitas and must say, they rocked my world. You might be thinking that any old sizzling hot skillet containing onions, bell peppers, tomatoes and perfectly cooked chicken is fully capable of making your grandmother blush; however, where Three Amigos triumphs is the seasonings that really made it stand out--strongly peppered, but with a little more complexity that tasted just as good the next day. 

I will be returning again soon"}
{"text":"So I have been here a few times. I am not crazy about bad reviews but I couldn't even eat my lunch the last time I went. Its always just one thing that is not good BUT that one thing is enough to give me a reason to stick with my Taco Trucks for a while. Sometimes its the soggy chips. Sometimes the salsa tastes like marinara sauce. It's just not my cup of tea. The service is good. The beer specials are good. I just need to break from the disappointment for a bit. I will go it again in a few months I'm sure as it is close to my office. In the meantime I need to brush up on my spanish - no one at the Taco Truck on South Blvd speaks english!"}
{"text":"Three Amigos has become my go-to spot for Mexican food. Their margaritas are insanely good (not fluorescent green pre-made mix like most places), the food is delicious and the service is always friendly and fast. My favorite lately has been the Enchiladas Verdes, the portion is so big you easily have enough for lunch the next day. Their homemade flour tortillas are also worth a shout-out. 

I love this place - try to go on the early side before there is a wait. You should also go on a Friday for a $5 giant house margarita!"}
{"text":"If you want sloppy, great-tasting, Americanized Mexican food where you walk in hungry and walk out hating yourself for eating all of those chips, Three Amigos is the top place to go in Charlotte.

Now look, in no way can this place touch the authentic Mexican food restaurants I grew up going to in Arizona.  If this is what you're looking for, then forget it.  Walk out the door (but get a margarita first).  We're talking large plates of rice and beans, with a delicious tortilla filled with something smothered in sauce, sour cream, cheese and lettuce.  This is what you get.

So with that being said and setting expectations, the food here is great.  The Chicken Chimichanga is amazing.  The chicken was nice a moist, which is hard to do with this dish.  Salad was good (not healthy, but absolutely delish).  Chips are always great with that little seasoning on top of it.  Enchiladas were also great.  I went on a Thursday, which I found out was all-you-can-eat enchilada night.  Of course, I found this out AFTER I ordered.  Grrrrr...

This is a cute, casual place to come alone and sit at the bar or come with friends (they accommodate large parties).  I made the mistake of going here on a date (ok, my fault, I was craving Mexican and really just wanted someone to go with me to Three Amigos), so it's not conducive to a romantic, get-to-know-you conversation.  This isn't a huge restaurant, so try heading there before/after the dinner rush."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant because we purchased a 1/2 off coupon online and because two friends continued to rave on and on about it. It's quite a distance from where we live and tend to go, but the food was so fresh and nicely prepared, we'll be back on a regular basis.  We can't say enough about the food or the service, both were excellent! It's nice to find a restaurant of this quality and the pricing is so reasonable!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken enchilada and it had a ton of chicken in it.  It was very flavorful and seasoned just right.  The avocados were a creamy addition to it and the rice and refried beans were amazing.  On Friday they have $5 house margaritas and they are huge and very good.  The salsa they send with the chips while you eat is spot on.  It has the right amount of kick to it and the chips are also seasoned well.  This was my second time here and we will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Sunday and it must be good because it was hopping. The chips are excellent- not out of a bag but homemade with some excellent  salsa. There are a lot of choices here - I had the tostada and enchilada and it comes with rice, beans and a piece of avocado. Very large portions since we all took doggie bags. 
The margarita's were very good and only 5.75 - a deal!
Will return.."}
{"text":"Sister restaurant to Sabor but sit down style with wait staff. Excellent breakfast and even better lunch/dinner. Free chips and salsa and free empanada if you check in on Yelp. I love the chilaquiles and combo #1 but haven't ever had anything bad here. All you can eat enchiladas on Thursday for nine dollars (does not include rice and beans) and five dollar margaritas on Friday which are HUGE. Check it out next time you're in the area- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I've tried in Charlotte so far. Great drinks , food and service."}
{"text":"Everything here is excellent. I usually get tacos al pastor because they're the best! Rawr!"}
{"text":"OMG, it's no wonder this place is packed during prime hours.  The food is literally the best Mexican I've tried thus far.  I used to think Azteca held the crown but the power has swung full swing into Three Amigos' hands!  

Reading the reviews I too had to try the margaritas.....delicious!  I had the enchiladas (came with 3) for my main meal and it was equally divine.

Important to know about this place is, yes it's campy inside, yes it's crowded but believe me it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the most authentic and delicious Mexican food in Charlotte. I'm from Texas (and of Mexican decent) so I know where the goods are. I always order the Enchiladas Al Horno and they're excelente, every single time. Highly recommend. Very casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dropped in here on a big ole' Unofficial Yelper Field Trip to conduct a little reconnaissance on the current state of affairs of this little restaurant that could.  After sampling the wares, Three Amigos needs to change its name 'cause it just gained a new friend.

Started things off with a trio of salsa/dips and some lightly seasoned tortilla chips.  While even the red salsa was nicely done, the real stars were the tomatillo sauce and especially the green sauce blend of jalapenos and avocados.  This alone sets Amigos apart from the rest of the Mexican fare pact in town.

Also got to try the guacamole.  Nice and smooth, with a good blend of flavors, though I'd like it to have a little more kick with the spiciness.  Best part of all, a nice-sized boat of guac clocks in at just $3.75.  That's less than half the price of fancier places that mix it at your table- and as far as I'm concerned, I'll do without the show where the flavors are so good.

Entrees all looked good, but I tried out their pure vegan fare, and many props to them for giving this a go.  I had a trio of tostadas with beans, zucchini, and still more veggies.  I now know it is totally possible to eat Mexican without the cheese and sour cream.  Veggie fajitas and enchiladas verdes are also available in both a vegan and a vegetarian variety, though not listed as such on the menu- just ask the staff.

Loved the friendly atmosphere here from the waitresses right over to the manager, who checked in on us several times.  Also loved the fact the there is a mix of Latinos and gringos who stop in to dine here- a good sign you have come to the right place for serious eats.

By the way, if you are jonesin' for some authentic street food late at night, Three Amigos recently launced a late-night menu from 10 PM till 4 AM on Fridays and Saturdays.  Empanadas, chimi-churris and quipe.  Sounds like it's time for another reconnaissance mission- late-night style!"}
{"text":"Three amigos is amazing! Since going here I haven't gone to any of my other usual spots like Cantina and 1900.  The food always comes out so fast and it is SO good.  Their enchiladas rojas are spicy and have so much great flavor.  I recommend the queso with chorizo as well...ridiculously good."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to Charlotte about 9 months ago from Los Angeles.  We are both native Spanish-speaking Latinos and grew up in households where eating traditional Mexican foods as well as Central American foods was part of our daily lives (I'm from Nicaragua and my husband is Mexican-Cuban).... 

Coming to Charlotte, we knew that it would be difficult to find food that even comes close to the awesome-ness of LA's Mexican-food scene.  We are truly foodies when it comes to Mexican and Latino cuisine.... 

Well, Three Amigos is as close as  you're going to get to the BEST Mexican cuisine in Charlotte.  All the food is made from scratch and they serve traditional Mexican fare: tacos in warm corn tortillas, topped with onions and cilantro; Enchiladas made from scratch with authentic sauces.... If you eat meat, their Al Pastor is pork marinated in spices over 24-hours and is phenomenal... The Gorditas are hand-made: thick, hand-made corn tortillas stuffed with goodness; Plus, you can tell everything by the rice and beans (the staple of any mexican dish or latino dish)... Their mexican rice is just like my father-in-law used to make and refried pinto beans that are fresh, not from a can!

You cannot get Mole anywhere else in Charlotte that is authentic - this is the only place I have found that makes an amazing mole....  Plus, if you've got little ones, they are a family-friendly spot too... Our two-year old loves it here!  The service is great - everyone is friendly and attentive.... you may have to wait a little bit for your food but that's because it's actually home-made and not \"reheated\" from a can.... Do yourself a favor, and head over there for some delicious food!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte! This spot gives fresh, delicious, authentic Mexican food with fabulous potions at a decent price!!  The house chips have this amazing seasoning that keeps you chomping away until your food arrives. 

Inside is fairly small so it can get pretty packed during weekend and busy hours, but luckily for me and my BF we walked in right in time for 2 tables to be free. The server was very nice, and handled our orders appropriately.

I ordered the carmarines rancheros and my BF the steak,chicken, shrimp combo fajitas. Food dos not take long to come out and was sizzling hot!! My shrimp was not rubbery or overcooked and my BF noted his meats were all cooked evenly. The sauces and spices were not overpowering as everything complimented each other very nicely. The portions are huge so come hungry!! 

Only bad thing I have to say about them was that the front door had dirty fingerprints all over it!! It's a big pet peeve of mines!! Just take two seconds and windex it down!! Other than that everything else was great!!"}
{"text":"I get the hype. It's where the locals feel comfortable eating more traditional mexican fare. I think it is worth feeling a little more uncomfortable and driving a little further down, or even down south blvd for alternate restuarants. Recently had some tacos, the pollo was dry, the al pastor was tough. The chicken soup I randomly ordered was delicious so I give them props for that."}
{"text":"Tried the burritos hoping it was better than the last one I went to. It was a little better but not authentic enough. The steak was not cooked fresh. It seemed as if it was cooked earlier today and was reheated. This is probably why they served it so quick. They poured too much cheese over the burrito. We asked for guacamole and we got slices of avocado. They do not have unsweetened tea. The waitress was new and was friendly. According to the pictures I see here in yelp looks pretty good like the tacos. I'll probably give a second chance and try a different order. Coming from California it's just I've had great Mexican food and I've been to a lot of them."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded. The first time we came we left. We just weren't in a waiting mood. The second time we stayed and it happened to be a night with margarita specials. The food was good. Not disappointed, reminds me of typical Mexican American. Salsa was tasty but a little spicy. Seems like a rowdy drinking place more than food."}
{"text":"Okay I am torn about this review. I ordered shrimp tostadas (2 of them), tacos de carne asada, and a small chicken yarao. Okay so the total came out to $27.32. So the shrimp tostadas was absolutely delicious. The carne asada was burnt, and the yaraoa was so yummy. Here is the part that I do not like. After I did the math the total should have not been that much. I spoke with the manager and I told them the prices was higher than I thought, she repeated the price to me which is $2.95 for each taco carne de asada, $6.49 for the small Yaroa, and $4.95 for each shrimp tostadas. Also just for informational purposes I asked her how much a plate of Shrimp Tostadas would be instead of la carte. She said $12.95. On the website for a tacos a la carte, the price is $2.49, the price for the Yaroa is $5.95, and the price for a plate of shrimp tostada is $10.59.  I told her the prices do not reflect that on the website. She then asked did I make sure I was on the correct three amigos website, since they have several locations. I said yes it specifically says the address is Central Avenue location on top right corner. She thanked me for addressing it. Here is where I am annoyed , they should have rectified the situation. They could have also easily gone on their website on their phone to see that the prices were reflected differently. So for all of those that place to go orders, double check the prices in which they rang you up and what is posted on their website. I highly doubt I am the only one that has noticed this or brought it to their attention. We are living in the digital age and whatever prices you put on your website is what you should honor. Please just update your website and make sure the prices are correct. I included screenshots below so the owner and manager can see , yes I know how to use the Internet and the website I pulled up was in fact theirs and that I was not lying. Your website does not have the correct updated prices listed on there."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh margarita. Fresh chips and salsa. The mole was delicious - the cinnamon and heat came through. Server and staff all very friendly"}
{"text":"I am going with 5 stars, not necessarily because Three Amigos is going to out muscle a fine dining Michelin star spot but because, what they do, they do it as well as anyone I have visited.  Now, what they do is authentic Mexican cuisine with a few american upgrades like cheese dip, fresh quac and huge portions.  I personally love the chip dip trio they offer, maybe my favorite app in charlotte.  This one comes with fresh pico (the real stuff with a fresh hit of lime), fresh quac and my favorite - cheese dip!  This all for only about 5-6 dollars, and they will bring you chips until you cannot eat another.  The best part about this play may be the enchiladas poblanas.  So good, my wife has literally never gotten anything except for those, and we have been here a bunch, gets them every time.  I usually for the fajitas mixtas or enchiladas mixtas, but excellent samplers of their meets and the enchiladas mixtas comes with an entire steak on the side!  Always fresh, always cooked to order and always consistent.  Three amigos, you are my go to when I want mexican."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout a couple weeks ago. Naked fajitas were good, but missing all the avocado, lime, rice, beans??"}
{"text":"I have been to Three Amigos a couple times with friends. For some reason I also always run into tons of people I know there. Overall the food is good, not great. Maybe I am not ordering the right thing, but a lot of times I feel the food is nothing different from what you get at most Hispanic/Mexican places. I have tried the red enchiladas, the enchiladas verde, and there special enchiladas (I forget the name), which are actually more of tostadas. All were good, none were great. I will say the staff is always great and the service is never bad. Maybe I will try it again sometime, because it is a friendly place to go with friends, but I am not that impressed."}
{"text":"A week ago, the boy and I dropped in for a late lunch after a trip to Discovery Place. The restaurant was packed, so we waited about 10 minutes for our table.

With a Groupon in tow, we started with the guacamole. It was really good, but I like mine a bit spicier. He ordered a taco al pastor and a pollo gordita and I had the enchiladas verdes. He loved the taco and I had a bite of the gordita, deciding to order one for sure the next time.

I was happily surprised that my enchiladas were topped with queso fresco, crema, sliced avocado, and shredded lettuce, just as they would have been served in Mexico. The rice and beans were great, especially the beans (super creamy, just like my mom's!) 

For dessert, we shared the tres leches. I've been cutting back on sweets, so it tasted very sweet to me at first. But, after bite number three, I was in tres leches heaven. 

Service was a bit slow, but we weren't in a hurry, so we didn't really mind. I'm very happy to add Three Amigos to my short list of crave-able authentic Mexican restaurants the QC area (La Unica in Indian Trial and Don Pedro's in Pineville are the other two if you're wondering)."}
{"text":"I am officially missing the boat on the big deal on Three Amigos. Always crowded whenever normal people eat, the service leaves everything and my mother to be desired. I understand that they're probably nice people but during my latest (abeit, 5th) attempt at giving Three Amigos a shot, they took over 30 minutes to get me 1 beer and forgot our appetizer for our table entirely. The food is OK, but that's coming from someone who LOVES Mexican food so I'm always wild about everything because how can you not love any and everything Mexican? This is where the problemo lies - theyr'e just not doing anything great at Three Amigos. I got the taco salad and in the past have tried the enchiladas verde, nachos and fajitas and all are - eh. The bathrooms - ick! They get less attention that the tables, so needless to say on busy nights they're not visions of cleanliness.

Part of me just wants to love all over some Three Amigos because I love East Charlotte and love Mexican food and love establishments that love Yelp, but Three Amigos, I sadly will say adios and go to you no longer."}

My trip to Queen City aint complete if I don't dine here. Just love this place. Everything deserves 5 stars : Food, Service, Atmosphere & specially the Friday Large Margaritas :D.

{"text":"I figure after more than ten visits, I should probably do an update.  As much as I hate to do it, I feel like it's no longer worthy of five stars.  I still like this place, but here's why:

1. They have a lot of \"off\" food nights.  I can think of at least twice I came here, and my food was not very good.  The chips did not taste fresh, the salsa was bland, the meat tasted a little burned, and some of the food was WAY more spicy than usual.

2. The space is really cramped.  I am so glad it is busy there, but the space is so small in there.  The tables are very close together, and it's pretty loud all the time. 

Despite these minor issues, I still enjoy this place.  They definitely still have some superbly tasty and strong margaritas, which I really enjoy.  And you can still get a tasty entree here for $8-12.  I have a feeling some of the issue is how much busier they've gotten in recent times.  I'd still give them a solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Love the shrimp tostadas! I get them on lettuce instead and theyre SO good. Margaritas are perfect!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome experience! The food and service was great! We ordered the chicken fajita and a carne enchilada and we both enjoyed our food! Margaritas were great as well and you can tell they are made in the house."}
{"text":"Very rarely can you find good, truly authentic Mexican/Central American food. Three Amigos definitely makes the mark. They take the whole day to let their beans and rice cook slowly. Their ingredients are crazy fresh (and tasty!), the presentation is colorful and appetizing.

So far, for the QC, this is my fav Mexican spot. Now they just have to get more vegan options and I'll be crazy happy."}
{"text":"Is there better Mexican food in Charlotte??? I think not!! I live for the enchiladas poblanas and rarely order anything else. Their mole sauce is the best on the planet. 

Friends and family have had (and I've sampled) the tacos, empanadas, burritos and fajitas. All delish! To make things even better, Three Amigos also runs amazing specials and has a wonderful craft beer selection."}
{"text":"A new favorite, without a doubt. Great beer specials and the burrito was amazing -- fresh, full of huge chunks of moist chicken breast and topped with fresh goat cheese. Big fan"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with everyone else's reviews...this place is incredible. Hands down the best Mexican fare in Charlotte. I had only driven past it a thousand times before I looked it up on Yelp and couldn't believe the reviews for this hole in the wall cantina! We ordered take out and picked it up with high hopes. 
Needless to say, we weren't disappointed in the least! The food was fresh, hot, and most importantly, delicioso. I think every single employee said hello to me when I walked in the door and they had my food ready and waiting when I got there (10 minutes after ordering). I had been told that the green salsa was something you wouldn't get without asking for, so I mentioned it when I went in to pick it up. They gladly got me a few cups of it and put it in with my other food. WOW! So GOOD! It surprises you with a crazy after-burn, but the taste is crazy good. My only complaint...they forgot the chorizo in our cheese dip last time. I hesitate to even mention it, b/c everything else was so great, but I have to say I was pretty sad when I opened our cheese dip like a kid on Christmas morning and the main attraction was missing. I told myself it was my fault for ordering later in the evening & forgot all about it. 
Two more key points...It's only been a week since our first experience and we just placed another take out order. Second, about 2 days after our maiden T.A. voyage, a co-worker of mine felt compelled to pull me aside at work and tell me to run, not walk to this tiny little mexican joint in Plaza Midwood that she had discovered. I smiled and told her I had already found it. Do yourself a favor...check it out."}
{"text":"I came here because a few friends of mine swore up and down that this place had great Mexican, and maybe I ordered wrong, or they hyped it up too much, but this place was nothing more than ok.

We waited 40 minutes to sit (party of 2) on a Friday evening at 8PM so we were assuming if the wait was this long the food was going to be to die for. Now I know its really just because this place is so tiny. There are maybe 15-20 tables in the entire restaurant. The good news is there are about 6 seats at the bar where you can order a marg while you wait. The margs are huge, and pretty tastes, but also pretty weak. I guess that's what you get for $5 tho. 
 
Things started to look up after we were finally seated and right away we got complementary chips and salsa which we downed immediately. The chips came out warm and well seasoned and the salsa was tasty. 

YELP TIP: You get a free empanada with your check in and this was my favorite part of the meal! It was delicious, stuffed with cheese and beef and was big enough for us to share as an app. 

My boyfriend got the shrimp tostadas and he was happy with his meal. I got a shrimp and a steak taco and I was just not impressed. There was an odd taste to the season in, almost nutmeg-y. 

I think what really left a bad taste in my mouth tho (pun intended ;)) was the woman's bathroom. It was absolutely disgusting when I walked in, paper towels all over the floor, visible dirt, hair, and water everywhere. I couldn't even squat over the dirty toilet without slipping - I nearly fell in! 

Overall, I'm giving three stars because the staff was very nice and the food was very cheap. Willing to come back and try something on the menu, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Okay..the food here is amazing no doubt about it! The customer service is fucking awful!!!! I'm going to tell you about the last time I went there..I ordered  over the phone and got there and had to wait about 10 minutes for my food which was fine. I saw they had tres leches and I wanted one but I wanted to see what it looked like first because I like milk in mine hence 3 milks! I asked a guy working there if I could see one and he brought one to me and when I opened it I saw a dusty ass dry piece of cake with the thinnest layer of icing with NO milk! So I politely declined. This employee literally snatched it out of my hand and violently threw it in trash as if I touched it or something then he called me a stupidass in Spanish. I do speak a little bit. But he continued to say things about me to the other employees. Like I said I could understand some of it. I definitely would've gotten the manager but I had other things to attend to after that. But for this experience I will never go back and spend my money there."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's the closest I've come to authentic Mexican food on the east coast and remind me of home. The salsa is also delicious! I always order a large container, it's so good. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"OMG!  I have a new favorite Mexican place in the QC!  

This is a small place but what it lacks on space it makes up of food flavors!  

My first experience here was actually a birthday celebration for fellow yelper, Chad E.  When I arrived the chips and salsas were already on the table along with homemade guac and pitchers of margaritas.  

Three kinds of salsas ranging mild to spicy tickled my tastebuds.  The green one is the spiciest but my favorite was the smoky medium salsa. The guac was creamy with tomatoes mixed in.   Also arriving in time was the best queso I've ever experienced.  This queso was topped with onions and chorizo.  

As a meal, at the recommendation of Tonya P, I ordered enchiladas.   Tonya recommended the Enchiladas verde but I went off on my own with the Enchiladas Entomatadas which sent my tastebuds into overload with chorizo.   The enchiladas are surprisingly light.  This was welcomed actually after the amount of food I had already consumed.  And we weren't finised.

On with dessert.....Some of everything, please?  Or at least that's what was ordered for all of those in attendance.

Churros with a strawberry ice cream.  Yummmmmmmmmmm.  Just the right amount of sugar coated these spanish donut-like sticks.  But then came the flan and this flan was the best I've tasted this side of the Atlantic.  And finally there was the tres leches cake which was extremely moist with a caramel cream icing. 

So many amazing flavors.  Honestly, the worst thing I had here was the margarita and it's only because i haven't had alcohol other than beer in about a year and it gave me a headache.  Most people probably love the 'ritas here.  

Seriously this is a 6-star place."}
{"text":"Our little family really likes this place.  The food is affordable, the portions are large, and the Mexican is clearly authentic.  I've liked their enchiladas and chimichangas, and who can ever argue with endless chips and salsa?  PBR for a dollar is a good way to go too.  Make sure you check-in here on Yelp, they often run specials.  This is our go-to Mexican place in Charlotte so far."}
{"text":"Must say that their Carne Asada tacos were some of the best I've had. They had an awesome jalapeño green sauce also. Yummy"}
{"text":"11/16/10

Come here only for the margaritas!  And maybe the flan.  

We almost turned away, bec. Mom doesn't like \"hole in the wall\" places.  She's no food snob, but she does appreciate pretty spaces, and this place wasn't.  But we weren't here for the ambience-- we were here solely bec. a couple of my Charlotte Yelp friends recommended it!  Thank goodness my nephew was around; For some reason, he has this grounding effect on our Mom, and she rarely makes a fuss where we go, as long as he's there.  :)  (Thinking back, though, I don't think I'd like to take my nephew back to this part of town-- a bit seedy, and this was around 1p!)

First order of business: un frozen margarita ($5), por favor!  Second order of business, nos dan tortillas con salsa y guacamole (gratis), por favor!  Actually, give THEM some chips, I'll just take a few sips of the marg...  Nephew wanted a cheese quesadilla ($5.99); sis wanted a combo plate-- a chicken taco and a beef enchilada ($7.49), con arroz y frijoles refritos; and I one of those lovely-looking tortas Milanesa ($7.99) con pastor (seasoned grilled pork).  The margarita was good.  As usual, Mom and sis filled up on the free chips and salsa...  I heard that the cheese crisp was OK, too.  It was better-received than the taco/enchilada combo.  I don't think she finished any of it!  My torta looked good, but one bite of the bread and my hopes of a fantastic sandwich thrill went south of the border!  Having looked at prior food shots from other TA reviews, I was expecting this crusty telera bread w/ a soft interior, but no way, Jose!  No crispiness anywhere- just a soft roll.  Another proof that the photos here are deceiving (including the ones I've posted)- the meat portion was sorely lacking.  It's as if they stuff just enough meat in the center so that, when sliced, a cool food shot can be taken!  \"Donde el res?!?!\"  (\"Where's the beef?!?!\")

Ayayay, pero there was the yummy flan, which we all thought was pretty good, considering Mom and I make some mean flan ourselves!  Three Amigos' flan even looks like the ones our Mom used to crave for when she was pregnant w/ me-- slightly overcooked, w/ air pockets, and the edges crisped just so.  (Hmm... was I describing myself, or the flan?  LOL)  Well, this one had the air pockets.  The edges were of a firmer texture, and as we progressed to the center, it became slightly creamier.  

We may come back for another margarita and more flan, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food and great price! Got the guacamole for an appetizer and then my sister and I had a quesadilla and a chimichanga. Very good and seemed fresh. The wait was long enough to know the food was made to order but not too long! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is some of the more authentic Mexican cuisine you can get in the US for sure. The chips are crisp & warm and the salsa is balanced and fresh. My boyfriend and I devoured two baskets immediately upon arrival (they're complementary as well - always a plus!) I got the vegetable fajitas, and the portions are HUGE. This place really gives you your money's worth. Depending on how much you eat, easily two meals in one. Maybe even three. I also started with an empanada and it truly was decadently rich, oozing cheese and a thick crust. It was pretty big in size, like everything else (in a good way). We finished by splitting the churros and ice cream. Lots of ice cream and four caramel filled churros. So much food with ample leftovers for two people and it was maybe $30 - a three course meal with plenty to spare for $15/person. The pricing is truly superb for such quality Mexican.

The environment was very family friendly, though not a large space. You won't feel tight or overcrowded at your table, but I'm sure this place fills up during peak lunch and dinner hours.The staff was friendly and present, without being overbearing - all you could ask for.

Easy to order vegetarian, and certainly can fanangle a vegan order.

Ultimately, would enthusiastically recommend!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, nice ambiance and the greatest Mole I've ever eaten. Keep up the great work Amigos!  Muey Bien!!!"}
{"text":"The food was very bland, and all-around sub par. The service was also poor. My server didn't check on me a single time. The restaurant was dirty and there were crumbs everywhere. It was an overall very disappointing experience, and I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"So, we finally got a chance to head back over to Three Amigos after our poor experience the first time. And needless to say, this trip wasn't any better service-wise. The only reason I'm not dropping to a 1 star is that the busboy was very helpful (and the only person on staff that we saw in the dining room for the majority of our time there). 

Here's how our night went. We were seated immediately in a fairly full restaurant. It quickly became apparent that most of the tables were waiting for checks, so we figured we were starting off on the right foot. The fabulous busboy brought us our chips and salsa and waters. And we waited. And waited. And waited for a full 15 minutes before a server came over to take our order. I got the combo with a chicken taco and a chicken enchilada; my boyfriend got the enchiladas verde. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. The busboy (again) came and filled our waters and brought more chips. Then we waited some more. Until 35 minutes later when our food was delivered. 

And after all that waiting the best food I had was the free salsa on the table. No joke. The free salsa with chips was the best thing I ate. We then had to flag the busboy (yes again) down to bring our check. I didn't even let him set it down before handing him my card to pay. I was done waiting. We then saw our waitress for the last time as she brought our check. I hardly recognized her. But I can tell you exactly what the busboy looks like and that he was working his bum off the whole time. If I'd had any cash I would have handed him the tip directly.

We will not be returning to Three Amigos. I'm honestly not pleased that I've now paid $50 for two meals and both were mediocre with some of the worst service I've had. Ever."}
{"text":"My go to place for authentic Mexican food . Always fresh and consistently good. The fajitas are yummy and the chips and salsa are spot on."}
{"text":"Usually always a solid meal. I hope they were off tonight. We were seated almost right away, but the sever immediately asked us if we were ready to order just after he handed us menus. 
We order queso which was cold. 
The food took over an hour after we ordered. We decided ask for boxes after the food came out and as I was in the middle of boxing my food and putting g my credit card down to pay the server took my almost full plate.

I really hope this was an off night, because they are usually more attentive. Also sabor is always great."}
{"text":"The Good: Seasoned Chip's and delicious Guacamole! Insane portions, many selections to choose from, clean & tidy restaurant. Food presentation was very nice. Very liberal with the avocado as a garnish ( a huge plus in my opinion)

The ok: 
Not a huge deal since it's only a dollar but still, the server was friendly but didn't disclose up-charges (i.e $1 extra for more tortillas). My boyfriend is pretty easy-to-please so he liked his steak fajitas but I thought the steak was sinewy though the flavor was really nice. My enchilada roja was way too spicy (for me) so I probably would order something different next time. 

The bad: We called ahead to use our yelp deal, which was a good thing because the fine print says it's not valid on Fridays and Saturdays.....but according to the person on the phone, for some reason it's not valid on Sundays either. It's fine if you're  not going to accept these deals on certain days, but at least have that information clearly printed at the time of purchase.
Also, 
I despise canned soft drinks at a dine-in restaurant mainly because I am the type of person that needs a sip with every bite. I found myself finished with my Dr. Pepper well before my entree even arrived and I didn't want to pay $2 or so for another canned soda."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Charlotte! Authentic and where all the locals eat. The restaurant is not in the best part of town, but do not be afraid the atmosphere is great. The staff is very welcoming and the food is delicious. Generous portions for the price. Ask for Abraham he is the bomb and is the best waiter!"}
{"text":"Tried out Three Amigos 3 times now. Never had to wait, the service is quick and the food is a dream. I'm the type that's NEVER in the mood for Mexican, but I guess I hadn't had the real deal yet. The shrimp, steak and chicky fajitas are my go to and ya girl cannot steer away!

Also, the margaritas on the rocks are well worth the $10. Large enough for two, but fun for one!"}
{"text":"Why, oh why, did it take me so long?

I pride myself in my love for good food and diversity of samples.  I'm embarassed it took me this long to visit this staple.  One Monday at work, a coworker told me I had to go to Three Amigos because it is the best in Charlotte.  I jumped on Yelp and saw Benjamin G's great review as well - I knew time was of the essence!

My bride and I went on Fat Tuesday to take in all it had to offer and I couldn't be happier.  I've found my new Mexican joint!  Excellent margaritas that are reasonably priced.  Anytime I can get a 8-9 dollar margarita with 1800 tequila, I'm a happy man.  We shared chips/salsa + chorizo cheese dip.  She had the tacos and I sampled the 4 sample enchildas.  

I can't wait to return and will definitely do so.  If you love fresh mexican food at great pricing, swing in.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"We had stopped by another Mexican place wanting something authentic, but they were closed, so we went off on a hunt for \"somewhere else\".  We ended up at La Casa de Las Enchiladas.  I am so glad that we did.

Most everything else that you need to know has already been said: The English is good, but a bit broken and a few words don't make it through.  Be patient and you'll be fine.  The menu has lots of pictures, but it is also mostly in Spanish (there is English towards the back).  Point, have patience and you'll be fine here as well.  You can get Coca-Cola in a bottle, and though I can't tell you that it's the Mexican variety made with sugar cane, it's definitely possible.   They also have Jarritos and another Apple soda drink that seems interesting (I didn't try it on this trip however).

Service is friendly, the food is good.  Chips especially were some of the best I have had - at some places you get chips that taste like they've been sitting out for hours (or days), but here they all taste fresh.  The salsa is good too.

We had the carne asada, which was a solid choice.  But ultimately, my money is on the mole poblano enchiladas.  I'm not usually a fan of mole, but this was just incredible and quite possibly some of the best Mexican that I've had in Charlotte.  After the first bite I was trying to figure out how I could lick the plate so as to not leave any.

The only downside?  The atmosphere could be a bit better.  I don't mind a location in a strip mall - anyone who has read my reviews should know that.  The seating was actually comfortable.  But the lighting was pretty harsh, and I frequently found that I was trying to cover my eyes to not have to be blinded by them.  A little work there would do wonders, and gain them the coveted fifth star.

The neighborhood is also not the best (somewhat outside of Plaza Midwood), but it's not bad at all, and sometimes you just have to bite the bullet in order to get to the good stuff.  In any case, it's well worth the visit."}
{"text":"When we got here for dinner, as is the case with most Mexican restaurants, we were given the chips and salsa. Some chips had a red paprika seasoning, some had what looked like black pepper and some were plain. The salsa was amazing! We got the chicken empanada which was extremely delicious and full of flavor. I ordered the shrimp soft taco combo and my boyfriend ordered the tostada and enchilada combo. His food was great, but I forgot to tell them I didn't want sour cream on my tacos and didn't realize it till my order arrived -- not a big deal, I just scraped the sour cream off but my tacos still tasted like something was amiss even after adding some of the hot sauce. My wonderful boyfriend poured some of the salsa left over from the chips and voila my shrimp tacos were perfect!
I was also quite impressed with the service. Although our server took longer than normal to come to our table to take our order, she was very pleasant, polite, and attentive."}
{"text":"YUMMY!! I have been wanting to try this place for a while and I'm glad I did. We came after a checkers game and they were packed. They quoted a 30 min wait but we only waited about 20 mins.

 We got a booth and was immediately served chips and salsa. Their chips are thick and not greasy at all. The salsa is good and I love the onions in it. I got a chicken empanada for checking in and it was delicious!! I've never had one before. It was crispy and packed with chicken. We also got the trio dip which I highly recommend. Everyone mainly got burritos. I ate so much, I couldn't even try my burrito. Beans and rice are fantastic. Their ground beef is really soft and flavorful and not fatty at all. 

I'm already planning on coming back here and I seriously can't wait. One of the best mexican restaurants i've EVER been to!!"}
{"text":"Three Amigos is our go to place when we want Mexican food.  Not fancy, but always good."}
{"text":"The food was sooooooo GOOD!!! I love Mexican food, so I eat a lot of it and I can tell when its authentic. this is one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to so far in Charlotte. Not only do they give you a healthy serving but the customer service is great! I believe its family owned and the little old lay was just darling. Our food did not take long; margaritas and tacos! it doesn't get any better than that! Not only was the food good but I love the cozy feeling you get in there. If you haven't tried this place you should! its good and affordable."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place but 3 visits and only 1 decent meal (lunch menu special) - I'm a vegetarian and they have no options. And when they 'make' a dish vegetarian it's just loaded with onions two little pieces of peppers and maybe a slice of squash.  Booo!"}
{"text":"Te amo, Three Amigos. Te amo.

I've been putting down a fair share of Mexican food as of late and I was just delighted to finally drop by Three Amigos. If you're looking for a fancy pants Mexican establishment, don't waste your time here. But if you're like me and on occasion you crave delicious, authentic and affordable Mexican fare with a low-key atmosphere, consider this as good as it gets in Charlotte.

The daily drink specials are bangin' especially $5 jumbo margaritas on Fridays. But don't worry, every other day they are only $6 each. Prepare yourself that they are delicious. And.huge. And.full.of.alcohol. The service is kind, warm and friendly. There are a handful of servers who speak enough English to effectively jot down your order and if not, well, work on your Espanol, kid.

And the food. Delicioso, compadre. I've sampled a few different things here but I really enjoy their guacamole - full of flavor and cilantro. Next time I may ask if they can make it spicy, too! Their tacos (soft corn) are tasty and, again, garnished with a smattering of spice and cilantro. The chicken was succulent and well prepared and I also tried a shredded beef enchilada. Taaaaasty. Portions as a whole are pretty generous and, inevitably, I always leave this place seeking a siesta. I definitely want to come back and try a few other items...perhaps mole next time?!"}
{"text":"Well ........I wanted it to be so much better than it was because I've heard GREAT things about it.
1st - I called this establishment EIGHTEEN times to place a to go order and not 1 time did they answer. 
2nd - I went in straight to bar and told waitress I needed to place a to go order. 4+ employees passed by me, looking at me, and continuing to talk amongst themselves and never take my order for about 10-15mins straight. Another family comes in to bar and immediately their order is taken they are given menus, drinks, chips, etc. The same waitress who I told i needed to order asks her male coworker in Spanish, \"anybody help this lady????\" So he finally takes my order
3rd - food lacks seasoning, very bland. The empanada was delicious but the burrito, beans, and rice weren't the least bit flavorful.

All in all ...I won't be back. Bad customer service, felt discriminated, and bland food"}
{"text":"We have crowned a winner for Nikki's favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. Three Amigos, I hope you have a victory speech prepared.

Let's start with the chips and salsa. Can't.stop.eating.these.chips. What are these things laced with? I haven't had the guac here yet. Why? Because I have a massive crush on the cheese dip. Get it with onions.

I usually stuff myself full with all of the above, but somehow manage to force down some of my meal. I love the enchiladas. All of the enchiladas. Plates are huge. Huge and delicious.

Typically, I just get a water when I'm here. Hello, I need to save room for all the chips. However, on Fridays the big margaritas are on special. Who can say no to a giant margarita?! 

Yes, it's in a little shopping center on Central. Yes, all the neighboring businesses have bars on the windows. Yes, the sign on the convenience store next door reads \"Do Not Enter with Mask or Hoodie.\" Don't let any of this stop you from visiting Three Amigos. Trust me, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"man this place rocks. the prices are really tasty, and the food is even more so! Be sure to get some queso with chorizo in it..."}
{"text":"Because I love great Mexican food and margs, the fella and I had date night here last Friday night. Three Amigos was super packed and busy, but it was all worth the wait!

The space is quite small, and they could easily double their size/seating and still have a full house. We put our names on the list and ordered the house margaritas at the bar while waiting. BE WARNED - the margaritas are fishbowl and are mostly alcohol with a dash of marg mix. This is a pleasant-ish surprise considering most places chintz on the booze. However, I thought it was a little too strong and was glad that we had taken an uber after one sip of it.

Thankfully we just needed a table for two and were able to be seated relatively quickly. Groups of 4+ that were ahead of us had to wait much longer, so I recommend coming with a small number or during off-peak hours.

The guac, queso, and salsa are all really fantastic. I believe my entree was good too, but by the time I finished margarita #1 and started on #2 my taste buds were numbed. I really liked that Three Amigos serves GOOD rice and beans paired with most entree dishes!

Definitely would consider coming back for takeout or more margaritas. Rock on!"}
{"text":"Review of the Enchilada Verde....Really good! I had not tried it yet but I still like the Mole better but not all people like Mole. We went on Saturday night and right now the Mojito is the special and I won't say it was bad but stick with Mexican drinks! Guac was very good. 

A note to people...I took the hubby and he is not and adventurous eater. He thought it was ok but I had gotten him tacos to go before and loved them. He did Fajitas this time and said they were a little bland. BUT he was too scared to try the green avocado salsa that is amazing. His loss. 

So as said before...if you think think taco bell is typical Mexican food than this may not be the place for you. 

BUT I think we have established that the Tacos here are for everyone!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Latino street food and REAL margaritas (none of that mix-from-a-bottle stuff)!

Among the dives of Central Avenue is Three Amigos, a fantastic blend of Mexican and Dominican food that is loaded with flavor. Real hand-made corn tortillas, flavorful meats, and slightly addictive rice await you. I've had their burrito, an open-faced knife-and-fork endeavor that uses fresh avocado in lieu of guac, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Most recent visit, though, I skipped the plates and assembled my own entree from the street food menu. Two gorditas (completely forget the Taco Bell tragedy you are thinking of - looks and tastes nothing like that) and a side of rice. My hint to you: go for sausage as your meat. Spicy without being hot and a perfect black char give it a smokey quality.

The margaritas are to die for - order one, you won't regret it. They arrive as a clear drink with a slight cloudiness and a lime wedge. Why not the customary radioactive green? These things are fresh! Silver tequila and fresh lime juice mix to create these Three Amigos signatures.

They can get crowded, however, so shoot for a non-traditional meal time to get seated faster."}
{"text":"Living in upstate New York, funding good Mexican food is tough. Visiting Charlotte, I was ready for Mexican food. Three Amigos delivers in a big way. Good enhiladas, guacamole, chips and salsa make this place a hit. The green enchilada plate was great with shredded chicken, a tasty verde sauce, avocado, lettuce, tomato and cotija cheese. Wish there was a place like this in New York."}
{"text":"This is far from authentic Mexican food when we first went in they 
had good music and the theme of the place was cute we started with the queso dip..... we should have taken that as a sign very watery the food was bland with no flavor ! Honestly those that say \" it's amazing and great flavor \" I don't think you've had real Mexican food because this is not the spot. It wasn't busy at all so it wasn't that they were slammed and the food was cold the food was bland and their was only a few people dining in"}
{"text":"We were craving Mexican food and we saw the good reviews on Yelp! so we tried it. We went on a Saturday evening.  It is a tiny little shop, but that is ok with me! The staff was friendly. Food was so very good! The prices were reasonable. We really had more food than we needed! I recently started eating Gaucamole-so I am very picky and I absolutley loved it! We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great lunch specials. Food always made fresh and the enchiladas are dank. Great spot off central a little but outside of the main strip. Would recommend anyone who loves enchiladas"}
{"text":"So i have a new friend in town from Texas.  We were in the mood for Mexican, however he said he wanted AUTHENTIC Mexican.  I had never been to Three Amigos but had seen the line out the door many times when I drive by.   After being super disappointed at a couple other competitors my last few visits, i suggested that we try this place.  we arrived at 6....and thankfully not a minute later because the  people started piling in....and there was LOTS OF THEM! .

We each had 2 margaritas. ...which set us up right.  Delicious and refreshing and provided a nice buzz.

Chips were pretty good and had Seasoning on them.  I like the fact that they serve their salsa in a deep bowl so you don't really run out quickly.  The salsa was not hot at all...however, the flavor was decent. 

We both got the Mixed Fajitas with Chicken, Steak and shrimp.  Perfectly seasoned, not greasy at all, and a mountain of food.   YUM!

We also had a complementary Empanada from the Yelp app.  It was basically deep fried ground  beef and queso.  Had good flavor when it was hot.....but we had so much food at the table, i only ate a couple bites of it.  

By the time we left....the restaurant was extremely packed with lots of people crowding the door which is by the bar...and everyone was getting their drink on.  But we never felt rushed to leave.

I will definitely go back for dinner here in the future....as it was authentic...and very good!

Been in CLT for 13 years .....hate ive not come sooner."}
{"text":"The food gets three and a half stars. The service on the night we were there gets one star. The environment gets one star.

Temperature was about 87 degrees. Ceiling fans rotated, but we could not feel any air where we were sitting near the front window. 

Salsa gets four stars. Chips get three, maybe four, because they were warm and the waitress kept bringing them as if she knew our food order would be late.

About an hour after the boys and I got there, we still didn't have our food. I had to go get my wife, who was working late, so we were up against a deadline. I asked that it be boxed to go.

Well, we left, late, sweating, and thoroughly disgusted. But fortunately, when we got home, the food tasted good. 

I split a poblano chicken enchilada, rice, beans, and vegetables with my wife. It was very tasty. One of my sons had three tacos that he said were a good bit better (and more expensive) than what he was used to at Taco Bell. The other son had a shrimp dish that he ate about half of (portions are large, and he doesn't eat much at one sitting, especially after consuming copious quantities of chips!), so he liked it. He's picky.

So, here's my take: They had an \"off\" night for service. But they might be slow as a general rule, too. The place has a very tiny kitchen, a small bar with about 8 - 10 stools, about five or six booths, and about that many tables. I saw two waitresses, who were helping in the kitchen as well.

We got there about 6:10, and left about 7:20 with food in hand. When we arrived, it was busy. When we left, it was full. So folks were waiting a long time for their food.

The food is authentic, tastes good, and yields authentic gastrointestinal effects, typical of its type. But the wait was unexpected and unwelcome.

I may try it again when I have extra time, but time is something I have less and less of these days...

UPDATE: The manager read the review you just read, and emailed me that they did, in fact, struggle that night, with new personnel involved.
 
He apologized for the wait, and asked that we consider giving them another try. Kudos to him for being nice and humble. We probably will go back in a few weeks to check it out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I really feel like its one of the best Mexican restaurants around. 
The salsa is unbelievable! Every time I go the wait staff seems to be improving. The first time i tried this place out the service was awful, but the food for sure kept us coming back!"}
{"text":"First, how are the chips and salsa? The salsa was not to spicy with a perfect amount of cilantro. I ordered the enchiladas with chicken. The enchilada sauce was very flavorful. Definitely not the canned stuff. The rice and beans on the side were excellent. It was a large portion and I took some home. We tried to go on a Friday night but there was an hour long wait. The place is not very big. We tried again on Sunday and there was no wait."}
{"text":"I  like Tex-mex food and I like this place even more. The food is good and so the drinks, over the course of various visits i must have tried everything but kids menu :P . Quesadillas are awesome and so are the tacos. 
Guys you are getting so much love here on yelp, if you need more love and my 5th star figure out your wait times. I hate waiting especially when i am hungry and people are being served in front of me."}
{"text":"I came here three Sundays ago. The reality didn't live up to my hopes. Coming from Los Angeles, where Mexican food is abundant, it left me wanting more. I ordered chicken fajitas, refried beans, rice and flour tortillas. It wasn't nasty, just not delicious as widely proclaimed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is great, the portions are huge, and the prices are so reasonable! My boyfriend and I eat here all the time because it's right by our house, and I can honestly say that I've never had a dish here that I didn't like!"}
{"text":"Had the $5 grande margarita special on Friday. Food was decent and portions were great!! The service was mediocre (forgot our appetizer, as well as the table next to us).  Would go back for drink specials and enchiladas."}
{"text":"I had Nacho Supreme with steak and it is HUGE. It is enough for 3 persons meal.  Taste is decent. Also had Enchilada and it is ok. The red sauce had too much chili spice. Not going to order that.  I will go back here to try other food. Maybe I'll try the tamale next time."}
{"text":"I ordered the enchilada and taco. It was tiny to start with. The enchilada was watery and the texture was off. The taco was great. The waitress ignored me. I sat for over 10 mins waiting for her return. She assisted the table in front of me several times. When I asked for the check she kept walking away. Every time I have had Mexican I filled up on my meal not salsa and chips. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Their fresh chips and salsa alone are worth going for! Three Amigos is cheap and delicious Mexican food. I unfortunately live up the street from it so I find myself here for dollar tacos on weekdays 1-5pm far too often haha. 

I can never remember the name of my favorite dish but it's Pollo something and it comes in a stewed red sauce with tortillas and full jalapeños. One of the best Mexican dishes I've ever had and it's like 8 bucks. Typically I get two meals out of a lo of their entrees; the portions are huge. Not complaining. Their nacho plate is fit for a small village as well!

Tequila Tuesdays are surely dangerous and Their margaritas specials are the same. This place gets packed on Fridays and Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Got to admit that I hate eating alone....but I'm house sitting and not in the mood to cook. So at the advice of my daughter I looked on yelp for something nearby.
Found three amigos...and people were waiting for seats. So I felt sure it had a local
following.  Went right in and asked the waitress at the bar if I could get take out.
No biggie ... Saw some giant margaritas all around me....so I ordered one and she brought me chips and salsa.   Drink was great...could taste the cilantro in the salsa.   So there I was alone at the bar having a great drink w/ chips &salsa,...take out was ready so off I was.   Great spot. Food was decent too"}
{"text":"Consistent, inexpensive food. Always a default when no one can decide on anything. Always good service. Quick take out orders. Beef empanadas are wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Now called Three Amigos, with (as Faith just wrote last week) a bar, new carpet, another TV. Couple of tables outside, if that's yer thing. 

Importantly: the awesome chef that's been at La Casa since it opened is still here, and still in control. Flavors haven't budged, but the scope of the menu is larger (platos typicos, fajitas, larger selection of tortas, etc). Prices are the same for brekkie, a little higher on big plates. 

A little paint and a pretty new sign never hurt anybody. Still, by far, my fav Mex in CLT."}
{"text":"My favorite margaritas and enchiladas in the Queen City!! Make sure you go on Thursday for the bottomless enchiladas night or on Friday for $5 margaritas (but it can get crowded). I crave their enchiladas pretty often."}
{"text":"Y'all - this place has the BEST Mexican food in CLT. It's authentic, fresh and full of flavor. Their mole sauce and margaritas are to die for. Sometimes the food takes a little long to come out but the taste is well worth it! Be prepared to eat way too much because the portion sizes are more than plenty. Seriously, don't let the sketchy looking shopping center fool you, this place is a Plaza Midwood GEM!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Best authentic Mexican in Charlotte 
Giant margaritas 

Cons:
Bad parking
Hole in the wall venue, but it works!"}
{"text":"A weird mash-up of hip typography and craft beers with very traditional Mexican and Dominican offerings. The service was strange: I am still not sure which of the three peopl who tag-teamed our table was our actual server, and in spite of the group effort, it was weirdly slow to get our order taken and drinks refilled. The dip trio was not worth getting--the table salsa was significantly better than the pico (and I like chunky salsa!), which had a strange aftertaste. The guacamole was chunky and needed the piquancy of limes. The queso was served with a skin. The rice was dry and the beans were mediocre--but for me refried beans are only worth eating if they taste like bacon fat. My chicken chimichanga was fantastic. And the sweet plantains (I know, odd combination) were heavenly. It was a relatively inexpensive meal, though perhaps I'm just used to Alaska prices, and I left full. A solid choice but I've had better."}
{"text":"This is my go to Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. Margaritas, salsa and all food is amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great margaritas and fantastic food! The most authentic Mexican in Charlotte. The pork and pineapple tacos are a must have. My new favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"A solid spot for traditional Mexican food. We started off by sharing an empanada (which was free with Yelp check in). It was hot and delicious. For dinner, my fella got the steak chimichanga and I got the grilled shrimp burrito. Both were good and we each got multiple meals out of it."}
{"text":"Seriously the most delicious Mexican spot I've found in my neighborhood.  Would have gotten 5 stars but I think they missed the mark on service.  I believe they forgot about us, as we had to ask for a server.  I ordered the chalupa and its HUGE!  The salsa is not my favorite as I think it's too pasty for me.  You should try it....its awesome!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican! Great Queso. I'd been missing mexican since I left Texas, and this is the first place I will visit again. 

Not fancy, but has a friendly staff and great food. Did I mention they had soccer (and then rugby) on the TVs!? Love."}
{"text":"This is my go to for \"order by number\" Mexican style food in Charlotte .... though you don't actually order by number here (but it has that feel). 

The restaurant is small and typically packed when we go for dinner. Chips and salsa are brought out immediately, and it feels like entrees arrive just moments after placing your order.

Portions are huge, and I always have leftovers. My go to is the enchilada and burrito combo, and my boyfriends go to is the 4 enchilada combo. Lots of food and lots of flavor. 

Prices are reasonable, staff is friendly, food is tasty!"}
{"text":"The only thing worth getting here are the margaritas, and even with those, skip the house and get at least the mid-level one. Every food item we got was underwhelming, and our waiter was not attentive. Worst guacamole I've ever had anywhere, even out of a package from the store and the queso was very watery like they had extended it too far with milk. To be honest, I don't think even the margaritas are enough to warrant a return trip here."}
{"text":"A staple in the neighborhood, but unfortunately for three amigos they have way more authentic competition in a mile or so radius that when given the choice, I will often choose elsewhere when it comes to feeding a mexican craving.

I will give them this....they do have a tasty salsa and chips. Their guac is up to par as well, nice and chunky and flavorful. All the menu items I found to be a decent versions but thats it, just decent. The chimichanga however is something I will go to Three Amigos in particular for. Specifically because its basically a fried burrito versus how the more authentic places do chimichangas, fried tortilla filled with meat, served with a side of rice and beans. I like it all in there, preferably with steak. You can get them served with rice and beans or a la cart, which is plenty of food for one person to eat and have leftovers. They are also on the lunch menu for around 6 bucks. But this is really the only reason I will come here anymore and even the quality/taste of the steak is hit or miss. Its also the only mexican place (not doing a taco tuesday) that has had a wait for a table.

For my money, time, and stomach there are better options in the neighborhood for sure. At least it is better than La Unica...."}
{"text":"I love this place already im waiting on my food and im already completely satisfied.   Amazing staff and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"So good, I keep coming back. Everything is tastey, fresh, and hot! The alambres is a favorite, but everything is good and the drinks are fresh squeezed."}
{"text":"First timer here and I loved the place. The chips and salsa are just the right mix of tomato, onion, cilantro, and heat along with the lightly seasoned chips. The enchiladas verdes were a revelation but the Alambres was more Philly cheesesteak fajitas than anything else. I'm not saying I know truly authentic but I know when I'm getting something Bubba would like. Still loved everything else enough to give it a dos thumbs up :-)"}
{"text":"Food was okay, maybe 3.5 stars but that's about it. House margaritas were not good at all, and the service was poor. The atmosphere doesn't help and was not exactly a 4 star rated restaurant by any means. Recommend spending your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have eaten here three times.  Twice for lunch.  It was very good but ate there last night and it was fantastic.  Arrived on a Friday night and the place was packed.  Ended up sitting at the bar.  On the previous two times service had been uneven but Sasha was our server and she took excellent care of us. (She is very nice, explained the menu and is smoking hot) The chips are fresh and the salsa is out-of-this-world. There was a guy getting takeout and I asked him what he recommended.  He said it is all good but his go-to item was the enchiladas mixta.  I got that and told Sasha to mix it up steak and chicken.  Got two steak, two chicken with a piece of grilled skirt steak.  The chicken was good but the two steak ones were beyond compare especially the one with the mole.  I think Sasha said that it was the \"poblano\" one.  I am amazed at the negative reviews.  The restaurant itself is not much to look at and the parking is tight (there is parking behind the restaurant) but other than those two small things I have nothing negative to say.  On my other two visits I would have given them four stars because of the service but Sasha is the best.  Nice and personable.  Food takes a while to get there but I think that is because everything is so fresh.  They even have the Mexican Coca-Cola in the thick glass bottles made with real sugar.  My buddy had a margarita which he said was top-notch.  Did not sample any desserts but saw them serving Flan and huge pieces of cake.  If you want atmosphere probably not your place.  You want great food; you will have a winner."}
{"text":"Last night leaving this restaurant I was torn between giving this restaurant 3 or 4 stars. The food was OK, nothing spectacular, but not really bad either. The Cheese dip was very bland and very runny so I don't recommend that. The salsa was decent. I have enchiladas that again, we're OK but nothing go make them stand out and my fiancée had fiatas that were the same story. The service was really slow. We were in the restaurant for nearly 2 hours (not including our wait time) and our drinks ran empty several time and I just feel like we were placed on the back burner. But all in all, good enough for a 3 star I suppose...... Until this morning when we both woke up running to the bathroom.  It's definitely extremely rare for me to get sick from food so not sure what went wrong last night. I guess the best piece of advice I can give is to stay away from the chicken. We however will not be returning.

Update:
After a little over 2 weeks, the manager/owner messaged me apologizing for the issues and tried to make things right. This means a lot so I've taken the score from a 1 star to a 3 star. Hopefully this was a one off situation where we got sick."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I've been to in Charlotte. Staff is pleasant, fast on their feet and the food is delicious. Oh, and their margaritas are YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is Mexican food heaven! From the delicious warm chips and salsa to the HUGE plates of enchiladas, you'll never leave hungry! I get the enchiladas poblanas smothered in mole sauce. Oh my god you guys, it's the best. Everything I've ever tried is also amazing. Burritos are as big as your head. Margaritas need two hands to lift. Do I sound like a fatty? It's okay, come hungry and you'll leave happy!"}
{"text":"No frills, straight forward, and awesomely delicious. Stopped in with my dad for a late lunch...4 tacos for under $7?!?! What a steal! Ordered the cabeza, carne asada, and the barbacoa. To be honest I wasn't a big fan of the carne aside needs to be charred a bit more, but the cabeza and barbacoa were both some of the best I have ever had. Trust me I know tacos having spent time in San Diego and these are good."}
{"text":"I've lived in walking distance from here for nearly a year and only recently tried them. There is a reason it is packed EVERY night. I'm mad at myself for not going sooner. Admittedly I haven't actually eaten inside but have ordered take out twice. Their tacos are some of the best authentic tacos in Charlotte. I could eat their queso fundido for every meal (but I'm a sucker for queso...but who isn't?!?!). 

They always pack our bags with enough chips and salsa to last us a couple days. Speaking of their chips, they are perfect. Oh did I mention I also had their chimichanga, which I consider myself a connoisseur of, and it was definitely one of the best I've had. And that's saying a lot because if I'm getting Mexican then I'm definitely eating a chimichanga."}
{"text":"I just ate the most amazing, ridiculous, decadent, Death-row meal of all time at 3 Amigos. It was my first time eating there too. I decided to get the Yaroa which is basically smothered french fries with ground beef. I ordered the large appetizer portion through Uber Eats and didn't change a thing. It is basically french fries covered with ketchup and mayonnaise, followed by cheese and ground beef. I can't even explain how amazingly good this meal was.  I will definitely be dreaming of this meal and ordering it again but not too soon as I need to first absolve my guilt (and be able to wear my jeans)! So good!!"}
{"text":"This is a place that you need to look past the little strip of stores it is in, trust the good reviews, and take the plunge. 

This place was awesome! We were seated quickly as it was filling up rapidly for dinner time. The employees are very friendly, warm with their attentiveness, and fairly prompt. 

We ordered a margarita each... which holy moly... was enormous and was perfectly made....Insane and glorious combination. 

The chips were fresh and warm, and the salsa was tasty as well. It was that sweet spot between chunky and juicy which I love. 

I ordered the veggie fajitas and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Seasoned well, a good variation of veggies, and a large portion. I had to bring leftovers home! 

Overall, this is a nice authentic experience! The food and drinks are great, it is a casual place to pop into and get a huge portion of food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had. Seriously. My friends and I can't get enough! You wouldn't guess that the food was phenomenal by the look of the restaurant, but trust me....this is a hidden gem in Charlotte.

Best chicken fajitas I've EVER had! The queso, salsa, and chips are wonderful too. I've never had anything I don't like."}
{"text":"Let me set the stage: I work in Fayetteville, live in Charlotte. I worked 72 hour nights in 6 nights, and it was my first day off. I slept for about 3 hours (until noon) and drove back sans coffee. I got home, completed a few errands and decided I didn't want to go grocery shopping or go out to eat because I felt exhausted. So, I scoured yelp to find a place to eat. I wanted to try the greek place, but their kitchen is being remodeled. So, I decided to order some street tacos and a trio dip from Three Amigos. The tacos looked (from the pictures) like something I would get from a Taco truck in California, which is a plus. She told me 10 minutes, not a problem. I gave them a bit more time because I was moving slow. 

I drove to place, didn't see parking in the front and took a chance to drive around the back of the store (there is some parking back there). I walked my exhausted self into the restaurant and walked over to the bar area. The girl behind the bar went over to a take out bag, but I quickly noticed it wasn't my order, that she was restocking plasticware. No problem. I sat at the bar stool and waited to be acknowledged... Nothing... Then 2 other girls walked behind the counter. I was looking at the 3 of them, waiting to make eye contact and be acknowledged. One girl made eye contact with me for about 15 seconds, then walked away to continue doing whatever she was doing.  I just waited for them to finish what they were doing to acknowledge me, and ask if they could help me.... NOTHING. Then, 2 other girls walked into the restaurant and the initial girl behind the bar LOOKS PAST ME AT THEM and says, \"Two of you\". 

I'm pretty forgiving and can put up with a lot, but being blatantly ignored and then passed over is not one of them. I'm not a scary looking person (although I was pretty exhausted and felt scary looking). So, I stood up, put my debit card back into my wallet, zipped it up and walked out. Still... unacknowledged. 

Ironically, a friend was at Three Amigos and was shocked by my treatment. She recommended that I go to the Moroccan place next door, and I'm glad she did. You can see that review later, but let's just say they were super friendly, and I got my food super quick."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite go to places. In fact we even went there 4 weekends in a row! You have to order the dip trio which is a standard for us. The tacos pastor are great, as are all of their tacos. The empanadas are different since they have a ton of melted cheese in them so they are delicious! And you can never go wrong with their margaritas!"}
{"text":"I must say, I like a challenge.

So when I saw \"I'll make a deal with you. Read my review. Read the other reviews. Then go to Three Amigos, and come back and tell me I was wrong. I will print any compliment I get about Three Amigos.\" in comparison to so many good reviews, I had to check it out.

I'm back, and I'm telling you you're wrong.

This is authentic Mexican.  Yes, the waitresses spoke more Spanish than English.  But who cares when the food is delicious?

My margarita was wonderful - perfectly salted rim, not too strong but enough that I felt it.  Plus, I got a t-shirt with it for Cinco de Mayo!

The chips are tasty, not too thin but not too thick, with a unique seasoning.  I enjoyed the salsa, the green spicy salsa, and the even spicier new red chile salsa (sneaky spicy!).  I ordered the enchilada/tostada combinacion, and the waitress (correctly) made a suggestion that I swap my meat options for each (asada and chicken) and I appreciate that heads up.  
I love getting fresh avocado on top of my tostada.  Their beans are delicious.  The rice was tasty.  Their enchilada sauce was delectable.

I did not try their guacamole, so I cannot compare that to Azteca.  But where my entree is concerned, I would def prefer Three Amigos.

Overall, I had a great experience and would def go back again.  Keep in mind this is more hole-in-the-wall Mexican vs. 1511 Cantina \"fancy\" Mexican, but I think each definately have their place in my heart.

And I want to go back today for $.99 tacos at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff and strong margaritas."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan. The waitress was sweet and accommodating. The salsa and chips, with a seasoning, are great. As for the entrees, the best Mexican I have had in Charlotte! The only reason I didn't rate Three Amigos a five is because the timing. We waited a while for the entrees, but they were worth it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is as close as you get to authentic Mexican/Central American food in Charlotte.  The key to most any kind of good cooking is fresh ingredients and the ingredients here are as fresh as you will find around these parts. But, having just come back from Arizona, I can tell you that the Mexican food around here simply doesn't add up to what is available in that part of the country.  I really can't figure that out.  Anyway, like I said, for around here, worthwhile."}
{"text":"Who would've thought that this little place would be so awesome? I'm glad I read the reviews bc I would've never thought to go here. It's not like the other crappy Mexican places that are everywhere. This is amazing food and our server was so nice and very attentive. Can't wait to go back. And yeah.....the enchiladas rock."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Charlotte!  Food is fantastic and good margarita / beer specials.  Get the enchilada sampler platter.  Probably their most popular entree"}
{"text":"I am about to say something that may cause a lot of backlash... I don't think this is a Mexican joint (and by \"Mexican\" I am referring to the Americanized version of Mexican I'm used to, mainly like that of Azteca or Monterrey). Don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing wrong with not being a Mexican restaurant, but I wish I know the true origin of their kitchen and then I can just order what they are great at.

Just let's talk about the logic behind my statement. I have eaten here many times now, and something about their finished products just don't look quite \"Mexican.\" They have potatoes in their rice, which is more yellow and not that orange color. Excellent rice, but just not quite Meixcan rice. Then the other night we were there for a group dinner and when Arroz Con Pollo came out, it looked like Fried Rice! There was no tomato sauce, or melted cheese, or sliced avocado. It tasted good, GIANT portion, a great deal to be honest, but then it just wasn't the Gringo Mexican style Arroz Con Pollo one may be craving for.

SO - here is my verdict: eat here because it has good food, but I wouldn't say this is the BEST Mexican place since I'm not quite sure it is Mexican. And I hope one day they will have a side menu of the real origin of their kitchen staffs, because I am honestly dying to know what am I  really missing here.

P.S. If you are to have their empanadas, go for the beef or veggies - somehow their chicken ones tend to be dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Delicious! They only serve lime margaritas but they are fresh and amazing. The pico, guacamole and fresh salsa paired with their freshly made chips easily make this one of the best Mexican Restaurants in Charlotte. 

The staff was attentive and the atmosphere was very chill. Great for families and date nights."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had! Huge chimichanga and yummy chicken enchilada."}
{"text":"I am writing this review on behalf of my roommate. His only review is that:

\"They forgot my guacamole.\"

....nuff said 

Sincerely,
Lonely Without Guacamole"}
{"text":"Staff is always nice, food is prepared when you order it so its always hot and fresh. If you like Mexican food, give this place a try."}
{"text":"I don't know anyone that doesn't love this place so I am sure I am preaching to choir. I think they have the best mole in town and they are great about accommodating for vegetarians which is nice. For the first time tonight we got their trio dip and was really happy with the guacamole and really how can you go wrong with cheese dip, guacamole, and salsa? We also love the seasoning on the chips. They also always have good drink specials and their beer selection is fabulous for a Mexican place."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos! The Mexican rice is outstanding! Highly recommend this place. Plenty of food. You will not leave disappointed. Wait staff was prompt, drinks never ran out. Very good prices. Fajitas were very good as well."}
{"text":"I decided to return to Three Amigos last Thursday for a second chance dine in experience. Shout out to the owner, Dalton, for attempting to rectify my last take out experience. The server was attentive and friendly, she brought us our chips, salsa, and queso pretty quickly. The chips were good but the salsa and queso were far from acceptable. I have never eaten such watery salsa and queso in my life, no bueno!!! The server was unable to switch the watery salsa out for a chunky version. 

We came in specifically for the endless enchilada special for $8.99, not a bad deal. We had a choice of chicken or beef with red or green sauce. The enchiladas did take a while to come out but we didn't mind, had plenty of time to kill before our Star Wars showing at 11p. I loved the red enchilada sauce, very flavorful! The chicken inside was not seasoned however, it was juicy. This carried over into the chicken empanada which was free with Yelp check in, not an item I would order on my own. I didn't like the green enchilada sauce as much. I was struggling to finish my second plate. 4/5 for the red enchiladas. The other star was docked for the salsa and queso. 

All in all, thanks to Three Amigos and Dalton for bringing me in for a sit down dinner. I will be back for enchilada Thursdays and will only be ordering the red sauce. I will also be bringing my own salsa for my next Three Amigos outing, I'm not a risk taker."}
{"text":"Great enchiladas. I find myself craving their food a lot. It's a simple and tiny restaurant with great food and fast service. Awesome prices!!
Can't think of any good reason as to why they don't deserve 5 stars...they need to open a location in the new meridian place apartments and shops on Monroe road!!"}
{"text":"I was in town over a weekend trip with my family and as group decided to stop here based on the reviews. 
Horrible decision! The service was terrible. The food had absolutely NO flavor at all we all decided on different things and everything was bland and flavorless. This is a very far cry from Authentic Mexican food.  
The rice had no flavor 
The refried beans had an unpleasant texture and also had no flavor. 
The tortillas tasted store bought.

If you have had real Mexican food this will highly disappoint."}
{"text":"Sorry kiddos, no bueno. I was so looking forward to eating some Mexican food and found this per Yelp reviews. 

At first when I walked in, there was a strange smell... overwhelming for sure. The table salsa was good, but bland. The chips warm yet greasy. The PBR cold, the way I like. I ordered the one taco and one cheese enchilada combo. The carne asada was bad.. you could barely chew the meat it was crispy hard, the tortilla's dry, the cilantro/onion mixture lacked lime... The cheese enchilada was gross, even with the hot ass salsa verde on it... Not sure what kind of cheese they used, processed? It was gross. The rice was okay.... the beans bland... 

Jeez kids, so sorry, this southern cali girl just didn't find this authentic enough to re-visit. 

Also, no free wi-fi and they do not accept AMEX.  Oh and I though the food was pricey."}
{"text":"I really do love your food. I had heard that you guys deliver so I googled it and to my excitement yes there was a tweet that said you do indeed deliver.  I went to your website to place my order but couldn't find the delivery option. i tried to create an account but that was a headache because it said I already had one, so I tried to retrieve my password for said account. Your system then said I did not have an account. I created one using another email account. Still no sign of delivery. I finally decided to call. This was a mistake. Daneilla answered the phone. I asked if you delivered she had to ask others if you did or not. The answer is no and said you tried it but it didn't work out. I understand that but why is there still a tweet about it? 
That is what I asked her and yes very frustrated at this point. She said she would let her manager know in a very \"dismissive\" tone. This made me more frustrated and angry. I just said take the tweet down or let people know you don't deliver, in a gruff tone. She then had a sarcastic tone to her voice and it was rather disrespectful. She could have asked if I wanted to come and pick something up or maybe what would make me happy but she would rather anger a now \"non-costumer\" more than he already is. As I stated I love your food it's your attitude I can do without."}
{"text":"Great place to get some of the best authentic Mexican food! Their complimentary chips and salsa get dropped almost as soon as you get seated. The service can be hit or miss but most of the time very friendly, fast, and ready to help you. Their two entree combo with rice and beans is perfect. I always get a beef empanada and switch up the second choice each visit. Never had a problem with the food, except of course feeling too full to move. Their house Margarita is pretty good and sometimes the bartender has a heavy hand. Overall great food, experience, atmosphere and VERY reasonably priced. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"To start, the table chips and salsa are really good. Has a tiny kick and a little smoke. Flavor on all the entrees I've tried is great. Enchiladas verde is my go to. The only drawback is the place is very small, however, the waits usually aren't too long."}
{"text":"Want some head in your taco? Come to Three Amigos. 

Taco meat options include head (cabeza), al pastor (Pork), shredded beef, tongue (lengua) and chicken, maybe carne asada too? The tacos also come wrapped in two, not one, but twoooooo corn tortillas! 

Rice is just like I remember, and refried beans are not just refried beans. They're awesome when they're made right! The enchiladas are pretty solid and they call their rolled tacos dorados. Sometimes they're known as flautas. Tomato, tomahtoe; potato potahtoe, whatever, who cares!  I don't know the technical difference, all I know is that they're good!

They're even open late on weekends - like a real taco shop should be!  This place is the truth and this Southern California boy hereby grants his stamp of approval! Eat here now!"}
{"text":"I've tried many of Mexican places in my day and this place is surely the best I've found I'm Charlotte thus far!  Their green chile sauce is amazing!  I went in with a group of 5, 3 being newbies and they all replicated my order and cleaned their plates!  (Green Chile Enchiladas, substitute flour tortillas vs. the corn)  Ironically I ran into some other first timer friends there and they also left with a full stomach and empty plate. This isn't a Tex-Mex high dollar place... This is an authentic place that gets it amazing at a good price!  

Their .99 2-5 pm tacos during the week are also a steal!"}
{"text":"Traveling through Charlotte we went out of our way to go here based on the reviews. Solid drinks, food, and salsa. Portion sizes are about right, Did it blow my mind? No, but if you are looking for solid mexican food at fair prices and dislike chains than this is the place int he Hornets Nest."}
{"text":"I love this place and I can't believe I have not written a review yet The horror!!  This is some authentic Mexican grub. Some may pass over this place due to the 'so,so' location on central ave with the bars on the windows next door, but don't fret. 
This place is usually busy, so expect to wait a little. Let me start with the Margaritas, sweet Jesus they're good, they don't use a mix, homemade mix and as good as it gets. The guacamole is fresh and the queso is a wonderful representation of cheesy goodness. I usually order the Verde enchiladas, but I have had the tacos burritos etc. I have never had a bad meal here. The wait staff is kind and usually speedy."}
{"text":"Pretty excited to have found a mexican restaurant that serves one of my favorite dishes: Alambres.  I highly recommend ordering it because they make it very well, a ton of meat (and bacon in there if i remember correctly) slathered in cheese.  The only other place I have found Alambres at was in SF so when i saw this on the menu i was elated."}
{"text":"The food was good.  It was a nice little place to eat before a concert in Charlotte.  I had the steak fajitas, they were very good.  The service was a little slow, and not so good with providing water.  The food and company made up for it."}
{"text":"Always amazing. I usually get a steak chimichanga and veggie empanada. If you come here on a weekend night expect a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it. You can also grab a drink from the bar while you wait!
Easily my favorite Mexican place in Charlotte"}
{"text":"We decided on this place less than 5 miles from where we live. Believe all the reviews!! Food portions are ginormous!!! Made when you order. We took recommendations from the lady who took our order. Also got the guacamole!! Next to the best I've ever eat!! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!! Also have local and NC beers!! That's an added bonus!!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness.  Good Mexican in the Queen City.  
Enchiladas mixtas.  
We will be back (and again)"}
{"text":"Solid food! Glad we made the drive. My litmus test is always the salsa. It was pretty good, great fresh chips as well!"}
{"text":"Wow. So much better than we even imagined. The nachos supreme was more than enough food for 2 of us"}
