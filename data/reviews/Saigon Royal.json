{"text":"Great pho, awesome spring rolls.  Hubby loved the Thai Satay Chicken soup.  Service was fantastic!  Definitely will be going back often."}
{"text":"Changed ownership, give it a shot!  Would have to say that the customer service has improved drastically and the food is on par with other Vietnamese restaurants in south Calgary."}
{"text":"I can only echo all the previous positive reviews here. The service was friendly and the food was fresh and delicious. We had a #27 and #23 and veggie spring rolls which were some of the best I've had..Very good soup also compared to the many bowls of pho we've had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Eat here every week,  good food well prepared and served.  Great personal service from owners who make you feel welcome.   Recommend #25 and #28.  Out of the way but worth the hunt"}
{"text":"Service was a 10. Polite and friendly without being obtrusive. It's been a long while since I walked into a restaurant that made me feel like a valued customer without being cloyingly so. Server asked if it was my first time and once I said yes, took his time to explain menu items and which sauce goes with each appetizer item on my platter.   Food: the appetizer menu had a build-your-own platter option which I chose. I enjoyed the spring roll, wonton and pork dumpling. Not such a big fan of the non-fried spring roll. All the accompanying sauces were good. I enjoyed the wonton so much, I ordered another set to-go. For entrée, I had the deluxe beef satay on vermicelli. It was was flavourful but missing a little something I couldn't quite put my finger on. The portion size was generous and I was no where close to finishing it.   Seating area: fairly small, around 10 tables seating up to 35(?) people plus 2 high chairs. I got in as the first customer around 1130 am. I was done just before noon and by then there was only one empty table left so this place does fill up fast.  My entire lunch including tax was $30+ which is a bit much for lunch. The menu items themselves are not more expensive than will be seen elsewhere, but ordering more than an entrée adds to the tab pretty quickly.   Would I eat here again? Absolutely! Best part of this meal was definitely the service. Hard to beat"}
{"text":"This is a place my wife, kids and I visit once a week for the delicious food and great service.  It's a great family who own this restaurant and they put their heart into each dish and the restaurant.  I have tried many, many dishes and almost all soups and have never been disappointed.  It's clean, they are friendly and efficient.  The Pho soup broth is delicious and my favorite item on their menu is #29 - Seafood Thai Satay Rice Noodle Soup.    BobbyK"}
{"text":"There's nothing more satisfying than a piping hot bowl of pho when the weather plunges to -33°C. I discovered this place when I once made a wrong turn in the middle of the night. After looking the place up and reading the rave reviews on Urbanspoon and Yelp, I decided I had to drive a bit out of my way to try this place and it did not disappoint. My boyfriend and I ordered takeout and we were kindly invited to sit down and offered a pot of tea to warm us up while we waited. I took as a good sign for what I believe were all the repeat customers in the place as the owner greeted and spoke to them all on a first name basis.We received a couple of cans of soft drinks with our order on the house, which was an unexpected nice touch. I couldn't wait to get home to eat!! The pho was hot and delicious with a clear, flavorful broth and it definitely chased those winter chills away. I will definitely be returning again. :)"}
{"text":"A history of return visits, and a soup, noodle, and service realignment at some other Vietnamese places in the city has me thinking that this place deserves to be bumped up to a 5!  Food is consistent, fresh, and tasty. A much more bland visit to the nearly identical menu'ed Mina's proved to me that the service and care you receive in the front of the house is mirrored by what's going on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Found this little gem after being recommended by a stranger.  It's your typical Vietnamese menu, but the quality is much higher than other restaurants in the deep SE.  Small, family-run restaurant who truly appreciate your business.  They thank you for the tip and remember most regulars by name!  They also throw in a can of pop with your takeout...nice touch!  Way better than anything you'll find on 130th, copperfield, and douglasglen!"}
{"text":"As I live in Vancouver, which has reached the pho saturation point (prolly due to the amount of rain here), I would consider myself to be quite well-versed in the pho department. I've had pho at a few other places in Calgary as I'm there on business monthly. This is the best one so far. Full flavour, fresh ingredients, quick service, friendly staff. Nothing to complain about. They also have Thai soups if you want a slight change from the usual.   This one's a keeper."}
{"text":"Pho isn't new to me, we spent 6wks in Vietnam travelling from the South to the North eating a lot of bowls along the way. We've also eaten in most Calgary pho restaurants. Pho soup stock has many variations, lots of 'family secret ingredients' and you never know what you are going to get in a first visit - in most Calgary bowls the stock is lackluster and greasy - so it's exciting to get a great bowl in a new place. I gotta say... Saigon Royal is my new favourite bowl.  I ordered a #15 for my boys to share and a #26 for myself. Rather than describe it I'll leave it to you to go order it yourself. Sooooooo good.   On top of the great food the family run shop is super friendly as an added bonus.   Service aside, a bowl has to be able to stand on it's own merits, and all I can say is long live the #26!"}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood Vietnamese Restaurant and luckily, it's a winner.    The food is fresh and delicious.  I'm kind of a creature of habit as I always get the Vermicelli Grilled Pork & Spring Roll but my friends have ordered other dishes and have always been pleased."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It had such amazing authentic food that is really hard to come by! The stay was extremely helpful and friendly; they were more than willing to answer any questions we had and gave thoughtful answers when we did ask. Honestly such a wonderful place I cannot wait to go again."}
{"text":"Great pho and friendly staff. Ate here twice in a week and that says a lot. Was back and will be back again."}
{"text":"This place is now under new ownership, after the original owner, Hawk, opened a new restaurant in the NW which is closer to his home. Went here for dinner with my little (but much taller than me!) brother. I had the stir-fried tofu and veggies with steamed noodles and a plate of spring rolls as an appetizer. I can never turn down spring rolls anywhere. My brother ordered a plate of short ribs and rice with a couple of fried eggs on the side. We also had jasmine tea and Vietnamese coffee. The new owner let us in on a secret: if you're Asian, he makes the coffee stronger for you!  My brother annihilated his short ribs and eggs. Even though my food was tasty, I had just taken some painkillers for a migraine and they left me without much of an appetite. The owner saw this and gave me a can of Ginger Ale at no extra charge. So sweet!"}
{"text":"Saigon Royal offers very standard Vietnamese. What it lacks for in innovation, it makes up for in pricing and incredible service. The owner is very friendly and gracious (he will thank you for your tip.. what a novel idea in Calgary).  Prices are more than reasonable and the selection is as you might expect from a typical Calgary Vietnamese joint. It's the owner's personality that will keep you coming back. It also offers great value for the quality as far as deep-south restaurants go. The nearest Vietnamese places (one in Deerfoot meadows and one on 130th Ave) offer lower quality for higher prices and very sterile service. As such, this is the place to go if you find yourself this far south."}
{"text":"Decided to drive down south city and check out yet another Vietnamese restaurant that's fairly highly rated.   Talked to one of the gracious owners (name forgotten ... again) and when I told him I wanted full flavoured pho, he suggested a couple dishes, and chose the sliced-beef satay rice-noodle soup.  On the first scoop, discovered a gentle-flavoured broth with a soft peanut accent that was nicer than most, and then added some heat he expressly brought, and some of their brown and red sauces. Then it was fairly flavourful, but still far short of Vietnamese street food flavours that hit the 'troi oi' heights in Asia. Nonetheless, the beef strips and thin noodles were good esp. after the lime, sprouts and basil leaves were added. Overall 3.75.  If you live down in the southern part of the city, drive over to Douglasdale Blvd at the small strip mall at Centex Gas corner of Douglaswoods Drive, and try this clean venue. The staff will do their best to satisfy you.   In the final analysis, too bad I still cannot find a true 'pho bun hoe' here in the city. In the city core area where we live, we'll therefore settle on Watercress and Pure Contemporary Vietnamese Kitchen as the best."}
{"text":"Ordered the curry chicken flavour was alright portion was small and it was not spicy at all."}
{"text":"Very tiny restaurant with fair quality. Good restaurant to have in neighbourhood, but not sure if it is worth-to-drive if I don't live near by."}
{"text":"Yum! We are in town for a lacrosse tournament and found this on Yelp! It was shockingly delicious! Who knew one could find such good Vietnamese food here. Service was excellent. The owner was incredibly nice and gave our kids each a free soda when we left."}
{"text":"The food was perfection as always. It arrived quickly & hot to our table with a smile. There is real pride in this place and it shows. The owner & his family are SO friendly and if it's not too busy will sit and chat with you.   Did I mention how delicious the food is? I personally don't like complicated food and theirs isn't confused with odd sauces or seasonings."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and the owner makes it the most special. The food is fresh and tasty. But the owner will come and make you feel like family. We were just there on a Friday night, the phone was ringing off the hook, take out orders, a large booking and all tables full and still when new tables arrived he would take the time to go and chat with them and make them feel welcomed.  We have not been disappointed yet and I love the build your own appetizer platter on case I want to mix and match spring and salad rolls!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best in the city..flavourful and great environment all around ..top of the list for sure"}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Had the satay pho which was ACTUALLY satay and not just chili oil!  I've ordered take out as well and the service was friendly and food was quickly prepared and ready when I arrived for pick up."}
{"text":"I've tried calling five different times, on Monday the 26th of June from 12:20pm through 12:37pm, and they never picked up. I tried calling from my cell and from a land line. Don't they want my business?   I decided to drive past the restaurant to see if their phones weren't working. What do I find? A sign on the door saying they are closed for vacation. Vacations are great, and I don't begrudge any small business owner taking time off, but how about you update your voicemail and web site when you go on vacation so customers don't waste their time calling you over and over? It's the professional thing to do."}
{"text":"Great foods. Good sanitation and caring staff. I am a Vietnamese so my taste is picky, but this restaurant is really above most Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"While this place can get very busy and the staff cannot keep up with the demand; I still very much enjoy coming here.  The rice vermicelli is delicious, and the gentleman running the front of the store is so nice that it's hard to be disappointed in the slow service."}
