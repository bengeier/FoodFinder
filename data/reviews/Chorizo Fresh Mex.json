{"text":"AMAZING tacos! Great selection of different fresh salsas and always made to order.  The burritos are huge and give burrito boyz a run for their money as it tastes more fresh.  Chorizo sausage is always my go to but steak is just as goo and always grilled perfectly."}
{"text":"One of the original burrito joints in the GTA and has always been our favourite, but they've been slacking lately.

On the plus side, their ingredients are always so fresh - they have no freezers or heat lamps. Beans and veggies are made throughout the day as well as the variety of salsas. The key differentiator is they grill your meat to order! 

I always get the chicken burrito with rice, black beans, cheese, lettuce, guac (which they DON'T charge extra for!), pico, salsa verde (deliciously tart and spicy), sour cream, lime, cilantro, green tabasco. I wish they grilled the burrito at the end, sometimes the tortilla gets too chewy so I'll go for the naked burrito instead.

More recently it seems like the staff isn't trained very well. My meat has been smaller portions and charred to death the past couple of times - they leave it on the grill for way too long. Also the burrito wrapping skills are sub par. Pretty disappointing but I'll probably be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Horrible ordered the steak burrito tiny steak they cut up like for a 2 year old kid mostly all veggies steak was tasteless never going there again taco bell makes a better burrito wow not sure who wrote reviews on this place never going there again do no recommend at all and for almost 12 bucks for a burrito thought it would be good payed 12 for veggies"}
{"text":"I'm really confused as to why this place has any good reviews. We came here for a quick bite and ordered a chicken burrito bowl to share. Everything about it was bland! Compared to other burrito places, the portion was smaller as well. 

Service was friendly and guac didn't cost extra - I think these are the only things that has it going for them."}
{"text":"Love this place, I think I probably eat here too much..

It's in a quiet location in a strip mall in Mississagua.

Great quality fresh food, not a bad price and cool staff.

If you want mexican food anywhere near Toronto I suggest going here."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food!  I have the steak burrito with everything on it and hot sauce."}
{"text":"I decided to try Chorizo based on someone I heard raving about how much better this place is than Chipotle. I thought it too good to be true because Chipotle is truly awesome, but I decided to give it a try, and I can honestly say this experience was terrible from start to finish. I had a feeling it would be this way almost immediately with the indifferent reception we got from the guy taking our orders. After placing our orders and paying $50 we noticed the store has a rewards card. When we said we wanted to get the rewards card the cashier said we couldn't because he already processed our transaction. We persisted and said he should have let us know about the program before processing the order, and then we asked for a manager who finally managed to set things right. The people assembling food on the line were painfully slow and the portions were really stingy. Unlike, Chipotle or some of the other burrito places, everything is measured here using a half cup scoop - nothing more - and the portions are extremely stingy. One of the servers put a bit extra in my sister's fajita bowl and actually scooped it back out. Whe we finally got the food and sat down to eat in the restaurant everything was lukewarm to cold. The homemade tortilla chips that came with our order tasted stale and were soft rather than crunchy, and the salsa and guac were also mediocre at best. So to sum up, it's a big fat hell no don't go to Chorizo!"}
{"text":"Chorizo SOO much better than Burrito Boyz.  Just saying."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out and it was pretty damn amazing. Fresh squeezed lime on your burrito and quesadilla, mango salsa...yes mango freakin salsa. 

They're Open late and their prices are great for the quality.  Even as an avid burrito boys fan, this place will be my first pick after tasting that fresh grilled steak.

Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Tastes fresh,  great portions,  I had a great customer experience.  What else do you need from a burritos/taco place.  Would come again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I will drive all the way from Etobicoke to eat here on a regular basis, the food is that good!

The emphasis is on fresh, not fast, food at Chorizo. Everything is made to order, no heat lamps! We usually order the soft shell tacos, but have  also had the burrito on occasion. The chorizo sausage is quite flavourful, as is the chicken. The fresh salsas and guacamole are also really tasty, too."}
{"text":"The food is good but I was disappointed when I asked for some cilantro for my soft taco which is a MUST for me (kind of like ketchup for your fries).
The short blonde girl just replied nonchalantly with dead eyes \"I don't think we have any chopped up\"....Um, ok?  She didn't even bother to go back and look, I was the only person in line, was it too much to ask?
Don't think I'll be back, unless I'm packin' my own cilantro, kind of a deal breaker for me.  I'll stick with Senor Burrito up the street, at least they want to please their customers."}
{"text":"My first time trying this location, but I've long been a fan of the Oakville locations. It was taco Tuesday today ($5 tacos), so of course I got an order of steak tacos. 

The steak is freshly grilled for your tacos and it was a nicely cooked medium. You get to choose two freshly made salsas and I usually go with the pineapple salsa and the salsa fresca (essentially a pico de gallo). I never get cheese or sourcream and I usually omit the lettuce. At most places this would leave you with a very skimpy taco, but here that's not the case. The two salsas, abundant steak, jalapenos, and cilantro filled my tortillas quite nicely."}
{"text":"Had a burrito bowl with cooked to order Chorizo per recommendation of order taker.

Mango and pineapple salsa was fresh and tasted great. Guacamole was good as well.

Not really located on Southdown. Right in front of Metro grocery."}
{"text":"The best fast food burrito option in the GTA, Chorizo leaves its competitors in the dust by matching Chipotle's fresh ingredient-friendly ethos while offering a superior selection of flavours and toppings. 

While pricier than most burrito joints, guac is free (!!!) along with a tremendous array of hot sauces and cilantro, jalapeños and freshly squeezed limes, building in a cost that any serious burrito eater is going to rack up anyway. 

In addition, the salsa selection allows you to customize in a way the Mild-Medium-Hot world could never dream of, with Fresca, Verde, Corn and Peach salsas taking you on the express train to Flavourtown. 

A more authentic cheese and a brown rice option would be nice additions, but even with room to grow Chorizo is burrito royalty in this town."}
{"text":"Its really good food! I have to say a very good one but i think it is way overpriced. You can have the same quality food at ole gourmet and its way cheaper."}
{"text":"slow service. less quantity. overstaffed. No smile and No greeting customer. Food is tasty but people need to be more friendly and customer oriented. 

I would not go again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their burritos are the best I've had in Canada. The shrimp burrito is my favourite and reminds me of a burrito I had in Porta Vallarta. The pineapple carn salsa is delis. Never a disappointment eating at Chorizo and alway so fresh."}
{"text":"Horrible Burrito bowls. Absolutely disgusting. I ordered a burrito bowl without the bread from Uber Eats and my Burrito looks and tastes atrocious. I got barely any food and it was all tossed around like a giant gloopy mess. Avoid this place. Don't know how they're still in business."}
{"text":"One of the few gems in the area.  Discovered it a few years ago when I first started working in the area and have been doing ever since.  Even turned a few friends to it.

The food is pretty good, and for most part pretty fresh.  The portions are always generous.

While there are many options on the menu, I always get the burrito.  With the choice of chicken, steak, chorizo, pulled pork, pulled beef, or shrimp.

The shell is quickly steamed in some sort of iron press.  You get the choice of black or pinto beans with your rice.  Lettuce, cheese and guac are next.  Then you get to pick 2 from 6 different types of salsa.  From good ol' pico de gallo and salsa verde to roasted corn or pineapple mango.  Topped with sour cream, jalapeño and your choice of hot sauce (they got a crap ton to pick from)

The grilled meat is then chopped into small piece, placed into your burrito and it gets rolled up.  The regular burrito weights literally close to, if not over, 1 pound. haha.

It's a fast food place.  They offer seating inside and a couple of tables with some chairs outside. 

Due to my work's strict no alcohol policy, I've never been able to take advantage of their selling of beers!

Also, every April 20th, on their anniversary, their burritos are only $4.20.  Make sure you show up hungry with a lot of time, because there will be a LINE.  Don't forget to sign up for their loyalty program where you earn points for dollar spent, and you get to redeem it for yes, MORE BURRITOS!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great value for money.   Ingredients are fresh, spices hot, and the service is friendly.   

Unlike other fast food joints, where the food is available immediately(!), you have to wait (yes, wait) for the food to get cooked - I say this as a positive. It's somewhat reassuring to see them put onto the grill the meat you have just ordered.

I've been coming here for about 2 years, and the quality is very consistent.

The only negative I can point out, is that the ambiance isn't great, but then I don't expect people to come here for the ambiance or a romantic meal.

M"}
{"text":"Have had good burritos there before but this time, ordered the Taco salad. They need to change the name of the item as it comes with ZERO tacos, no taco shell...basically it's their burrito toppings in a takeout box. The steak topping was undercooked for my taste (they should ask how you want it-it's only cooked for seconds on the hot plate).

Barely any cheese on it either.Very disappointed and will go to Senor Burrito next time on Erin Mills."}
{"text":"damn Yelp and stupid Yelp friends.  I had my dinner all prepared from yesterday, and then someone checked in to a burrito place.  So now I freakin feel like a burrito!!!  I don't want to go the burrito place (which is a chain and there is one two minutes from my home), that person went to because I've been there like 10 times, so I decide to drive to the southwest edge of Mississauga (bordering Oakville) to get a burrito!  (actually, I had to go that way anyways to pick up someone, but still!!!).  

Oh yeah, now that I'm done fake venting, about the food.  I first came here when it first opened, which was probably close to 7-8 years ago.  At that time, I had a different car, had a different job, less money, still in school and still both parents were alive.  A lot has changed since then.  At that point, the food was pretty good.  

So now?  Still pretty good.  I ordered the barbacoa burrito.  I really liked the choice of their salsas (they had 4 different types - one with mango, one that was corn, one with tomato, and one green saucy one - verde) and it looked amazing.  I had the mango one with the burrito! It was so damn good!!  Also, the meat was pretty good too, but I prefer Burrito Boyz.  What I didn't like was that they don't grill the burrito and just roll it up.  Overall, not bad though.  

Service: 3.25/5 - very friendly for fast food
Atmosphere - 3/5 not super clean, but not super dirty. 
Food - oh, so close to getting 5/5 but you didn't grill the burrito!!!  3.5/5.  

I think if they grilled the burrito, it'd be at least 4 out of 5 stars.  Match made in heaven would be Chorizo salsa and guacomole with Burrito Boyz meat and grill.  Someone make it happen!!!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of good Mexican restaurants in the burbs, so I come here when I need a fix. The burritos are great, all the meats are cooked fresh while you wait. The salsas also have a lot of flavor and are really fresh. It seems like this place borrowed their format from the US chain Chipotle. It is my opinion that Chorizo does it better as the meat isn't sitting there in a container when you arrive. There aren't too many local joints in the suburbs where you can grab a quick bite, as all we have is multiple locations of the same tired chains, which makes Chorizo all the better. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My favourite burrito joint in the GTA. It's the only place where I can safely say that every meat choice is good. Every topping combines to create something special."}
{"text":"The tacos are good. The Chorizo and chicken tacos had a deliciously unique grill taste. Only reason this is a 3 star and not 4 is the toppings. You get lettuce and cheese and the choice of 2 other toppings? Even after opting for the guacamole @ $1.25/taco. 

(Mexican fast good should not cost over $20 for 3 tacos and a drink)

I'd return but, only if I happen to be in the area and craving Mexican."}
{"text":"Started coming here in high school when it first opened up.  I recommend the El Grande if you're really hungry!"}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you want to be ripped off.  Everything is about penny pinching with this place. I stopped going there a few years back then decided to revisit and low and behold nothing had changed. Forget getting anything extra... Even if you don't get guacamole. Both my husband and I said no guacamole which is the priciest ingredient and then when I asked and 1/2 a scoop of salsa extra on my salad in leu of the 2 guacamoles, they said no.  We were both totally shocked.  Got our money back and vowed to never go again. Senior Burrito, Fat Bastard Burrito and Burrito Boys lately all have better food and right around the corner.  This place has really gone down the tubes in the last few years."}
{"text":"If I could give a Negative Star I would. The workers were vary rude. When I order and paid for a combo they did not give me the chips.  When I asked for my chips the lady Said  rudely said that I didnt order them when I showed her my recite she still said  no when it said combo. Also The food was cold. Fresh yeah right. More like Had been setting out for 6 hours. Ew.  Save your money!"}
{"text":"The place is packed at lunch hour so, eat at 1:00pm.
The Chorizo Burrito is so good!  They grill the meat on a flame, then chop it right in front of you. The service is fast, but friendly. The owner/Manager works their, she keeps the others engaged. This means the place is a well oiled machine. The product is always consistent. 

As fast food goes, I recommend the Chorizo Burrito. 

The only negative, they don't grill the Tortilla after rolling the Burrito."}
{"text":"AMAZING SOFT TACOS. Ingredients r super fresh and surprisingly really courteous staff. Most definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"For starters, they are incredibly slow to do anything so plan 20 minuted until you see a burrito. 

Mexican burrito shops usually put in a little effort into making some sauces from scratch.  You're going to find standard store bought full of preservatives and sodium sauces here. 

Corn tortillas? Forget about it. 

I hope you like chopped iceberg lettuce lol."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Their meat is so fresh, and definitely contributes to the delicious taste. Steak tacos are my fav."}
{"text":"here comes the bias
i'm sorry not sorry yelp
okay i don't care

greatest burrito
be sure to get chorizo
don't get other meats

all meats grilled up front
chorizo full of spices
you can taste char, too

fresh ingredients
they're not \"fresh mex\" for nothing
veggies, salsas, guac

burrito boyz? nah
behold, the burrito champ
chorizo fresh mex"}
{"text":"Man. The first time I went to Chorizo, it was a hell of a time trying to find it due to some bad directions. 

Was it ever worth it. Legend says the owner travelled to Mexico to work at a burrito cart to hone his skills. I'm willing to believe it. Such a great variety of ingredients are available for your burritos. 

They also sell tacos and quesadillas and you can get a beer or a pop to go with it. But go. It'll beat your Chipotle or Burrito Boyz any day."}
{"text":"Although I don't live in the immediate area anymore, I am still willing do drive from Toronto to have me some Chorizo! 
This place was recommended to me a few years ago by a friend and ever since I have been a regular and loyal customer! They have variety of Mexican food - burritos, quesadillas etc. The ingredients are always fresh and the meat is grilled right in front of your eyes. The salsas are delicious, my all time favourite being the mango pineapple.
The staff at Chorizo are always friendly and go the extra mile to make sure the food is prepared just the way I like it. 
Chorizo also offers a loyalty program, it's easy to register and it gives you points towards money off from later purchases and a birthday reward. 
If you are in the mood for good Mexican food, then this is definitely worth trying, just keep in mind that the place is always packed, but the staff do their best to service everyone as quickly as possible. 
I wish they franchise Chorizo soon, so we can enjoy it outside of Mississauga, but for now I don't mind the drive!:)"}
{"text":"I used to frequent Burrito Boyz (Port Credit) and it was great until about a year ago. So decided to give chorizo a try. WOW! No comparison - large pieces of meat and chicken. Amazing fresh veggies and the salsa's!!!  5 kinds, all made fresh.  The corn salsa is fantastic.  

Portions are super generous so bring your appetite! Also join the chorizo loyalty club for discounts and freebies."}
{"text":"Im now on a mission to try all the burrito places in Mississauga that isnt burrito boyz. This was my first stop. 

Its a little hard to find when driving down Southdown but eventually I found it. I got here at 12:30 and it was crazy busy. After placing my order I waited almost 30minutes for my number to be called. 

I got a chicken burrito with rice, cilantro, lime, corn, hot salsa, jalapeños. I also got extra chicken. 

The chicken taste fresh. And they grilled it right there.  It was tasty.

Although it was significantly smaller, less filling and more expensive than a Burrito Boyz burrito. It only gets 3 starts since I've had much better for cheaper so I probably wont return unless Im in the area and cant think of anything to eat."}
{"text":"Got the burrito bowl here. Honestly not as good as chipotle.. The portion was much smaller, they even weighed the amount of meat before putting it into the bowl and give one spoonful of rice. And at the same price as chipotle, it's a definite no-brainer... Chipotle is hands down way better! Not to mention poor customer service when choosing meal options."}
{"text":"Used to be consistently four or five star when they first opened but has gone down hill since with the expansion to multiple locations. Yes it takes longer to cook meat from scratch but it certainly tastes better."}
{"text":"Might I say best burrito in Mississauga?  Yes I think so. Love how the protein is made to order, and fresh ingredients everywhere. Great tasting guac but it was extra. Had the churrizo and wife had the shrimp. Both were amazing.  Kind of a random spot but hey it works. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good burritos given the location in an otherwise deserted strip mall near Clarkson GO Station in Mississauga. Closer to the Chipotle style than the Burrito Boyz style.

The burritos ($8.59) are nice and big and come one of 5 or 6 different meats grilled to order, or you can skip the meat for a veggie option. There's also a good selection of hot sauces and you can choose 2 of 3 freshly made salsas, which were excellent.

A good option if you're stuck waiting for a GO train and need a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Historically really liked this place. Today I got a chicken burrito at 11:30am, both the person before me and the one after me got served chicken from the fridge. It came out of the fridge with grill lines already on, probably leftovers from last night. The next two people (before I finished and left) got fresh chicken. Unfortunately the quality was noticeably worse as a result, definitely not 'fresh mex'. Not sure how often this happens but its disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food. Not sure why they don't have heating in their place. Very cold in the winter. The amazing food makes up for it though."}
{"text":"went here on a lunch break with a coworker and was very pleasantly surprised! even though it was a bit expensive ($16 for a quesadilla and a bottled drink), the food was super flavourful and fresh, and I'll definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Great burritos (better than Burrito Boys). Do it for a quick cheap delicious lunch.

Note: ask for medium hot sauce if you're getting both the verde and the corn salsas."}
