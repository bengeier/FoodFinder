{"text":"The Jade Tree is one of our favorites both for dinning in and taking food home to enjoy. We really love the Walnut Chicken among the sweet offerings and General Tao's for a great spicy choice. My personal favorite is the lo mein, in pork, although it is also good in shrimp and veggie versions. Service is warm and friendly always. Although Jade Tree does not have a bar, Chinese beers and plum wine are available.  We have never been let down by Jade Tree!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever tried. It's a small family restaurant and the serving are quick and good. Their general tsao chicken sauce is special and I believe it's different than outside. Chickens are fresh and crispy. Highly recommended general tsao chicken, walnut chicken, and cashew chicken."}
{"text":"Food was very good. I ordered Sweet&Sour chicken, so delicious. Food came pretty quick too.   Very nice place to go."}
{"text":"Solid place for Chinese food.  Prompt service, very nicely decorated and clean interior.  Would recommend coming here to sit down for a meal.    The lunch menu was somewhat limited with about 15 different entree choices.  No formal appetizers or sides were offered for lunch.  On the menu there were no real vegetarian options; however, they are able to make dishes without meat.   I ended up ordering the Moo Goo Gai Pan without chicken.  The meal tasted great and was served nice and hot.  It could have been a bit spicier for my liking, but overall was quite satisfying.    This place is relatively inexpensive with quick service and good food.  I'm not convinced its the greatest Chinese restaurant in the area, but it is a good one."}
{"text":"I stopped  here for dinner when I was on my business trip. I was surprised that the food and the service were so great. I was impressed the  by their great service, very clean place and delicious food! The best dishes I would like to recommend are: Honey walnut chicken and egg rolls!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for a Sunday lunch, not really sure what I wanted among the many choices in Mentor, and I'm so glad I did! It's a quiet place with great atmosphere. I started with the hot and sour soup, which was probably the best I have ever had. Rich thick broth with barbecued pork and fresh vegetables. Delicious, and super fast! At the server's recommendation, I had the honey walnut shrimp. It was absolutely wonderful! Battered fried shrimp, tossed in a sweet honey sauce, topped with crispy candied walnuts. I would have added a screenshot, but I attacked it as soon at it got to my table. I recommend this place. A true gem in Mentor."}
{"text":"Very nice interior. Nice vases and wood interior. I was disappointed on the menu. There is not a single vegetarian item. Menu is very limited and all in the pictures. Expect to have entree and rice on the same plate. It's like a dinner special option if you want to add on egg roll or soup. The chicken lomein was not my favorite. Noodles are very wet and very saucy. Noodles very broken and not in long strain.  Not my favorite. The flavor is okay but not authentic Chinese food for me. Great for a quick Americanize Chinese Food version."}
{"text":"Great service and really fresh delicious food! The egg rolls were amazing, chunks of pork and veggies instead of the normal mush. General Tsao and Walnut Chicken we're both really fresh chicken with terrific sauces. Plenty of food for the price and quiet atmosphere- very clean."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Jade Tree since I was born. The service has always been wonderful, and the food has only gotten better with age."}
{"text":"Seriously, I travel the country for work and Jade Tree is 4.8/5.  Sesame Chicken is great.  Quiet.  Quick.  Cheap."}
