{"text":"Excellent food and terrific service! Wait staff was attentive to us throughout our meal. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was DELICIOUS!  The chips and salsa and the mole enchiladas were super and their pomegranate margarita was super yum!  You will only need one....2 if you have a ride home.  :)  The atmosphere was fun and festive.  I will definitely be going again soon!"}
{"text":"Ah, Tia Rosa, I would come here just to bask in the colorful and decorative ambiance of the Mexican folk art decor, with Mexican tile everywhere, even on the tabletops, straw walls and lots of fun decorating. And the food is just as pretty, attractively served and presented on bright and colorful plates. And, by the way, it tastes as good as it looks. There's a reason why, when you drive by here at peak dinner hour time, the parking lot is full.
      On a recent Thursday evening, my husband and I shared carne asada beef and chicken fajitas. Beef comes more like roast beef than the usual sizzling on a cast iron platter, but it's still good. Con queso dip and chips while we were waiting was delicious.  Enchiladas, chimichangas, burritos...it's all good. Is everything totally authentic and all made from scratch?  Probably not, ( no substitutions ), but unless you are particularly discriminating, you won't care. My own personal pet peeve, and perhaps the only one, is the chili relleno is stuffed with pork and not cheese, as is the case in every other restaurant of this type I have been to. Would it be too much trouble to offer a choice?
    A great spot for a gathering of friends or family, and lots of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Service was great, but food was sickeningly sweet.

Server was really nice, the atmosphere was pleasant, and the restaurant had great decor.

However, the food was really bad.
The mole tasted like Hershey's chocolate syrup, the horchata tasted like melted ice cream (sweetest Ive ever had), and the salsa even had a ridiculous amount of sugar. No joke, even the salsa was extremely sweet! This is the epitome of Americanized Mexican food, even if they cut back on the sugar the food would still be mediocre. Unfortunately, with the addition of all the sugar, the food was straight up gross. The food that wasnt intensely sweetened lacked seasoning and spices. Ive eaten at this place three times now with family, all of which agreed to not come back. The dessert is okay, probably because that is actually meant to be sweet. But seriously, the food is gross because of all the sugar. 

Unless you love sugar in everything and hate spices, I wouldn't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"This is some very good Mexican.  Maybe my favorite in the Phoenix area.  I think the slow cooked pork is the deal."}
{"text":"We met friends for dinner last Saturday and had a wonderful time! The food was awesome.  The service was excellent.  This was about the 6th time eating there. We have not been disappointed yet. Love it!"}
{"text":"Beautiful new building. Beautiful presentation. Excellent service. 

Green salsa was delicious - if a little sweet - and had the perfect amount of heat for a wussy like me. Chips were good. 

I asked for the Squash Blossom Soup ($6) which sounded mouth-wateringly good, but they were out. I went with the Baja Seafood Tacos ($10) instead - one with shrimp and one with salmon. They were ok - I've had better at Rubio's. Fruit salsa - pineapple and the other was mango - was very good though! Unfortunately, both tacos fell apart and I had to use a fork. 

Husband got the Flying Saucer ($8)... looked fabulous and he said it tasted good. 

The price seems high for the amount of food you get so be prepared!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Restaurant, especially the back patio is soooooo romantic at night ;) 
Very prompt and good service (even when it's busy). 

Food is really good too. I don't consider it strictly \"Mexican\" restaurant - they do a lot of experimenting with seafood etc. I really like their crab tacos and salmon entrees with a little latino twist ;) 

The entrees run on the expensive side for their size, and so I'm giving them like a 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere. You can't go wrong with the enchiladas. Don't forget the fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Eating at rosa's as i write this. Waited a few minutes for my turn at the hostess stand. Lady in front of me said, 'table for 2'. Hostess said she was only seating full parties, not partial parties! What a crock. Dining room was not even half full. Hostess asked me how many in my party and i said only one and got a seat right away. Once seated, i told server that i was,a party of two and needed another place setting. Four stars for food, four stars for wait staff and zero stars for a hostess thats got no common sense."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place, great food and atmosphere.  We had great service too, and the best Mojito in town!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I almost always get take out but the food is fantastic.  I used to live across the street from the one in Mesa so I would walk over there and pick up food at least once a month.  I've had the shrimp tacos, fish tacos, flying saucer, stuffed quesadilla, chicken mole, seafood enchilada and probably a few other things.  All of those things are fantastic but I really love their 3 meat nachos.  It isn't on the menu with all the meats but you can get it that way if you ask.  I personally love their beef but the chicken an pork are great also.  Really one of the most important parts of any mexican food place is the salsa and their salsa is awesome and different from most other places.  They even have a hot salsa that is really good that you can ask for.  Oh, and don't forget the horchata, it is incredible as well.  All in all my favorite mexican restuarant in the valley and I've lived here for 35 years."}
{"text":"My husband and another couple and I had a late lunch here Friday, March 11. Two of us ordered a pork entree, and the meat was so dry we couldn't eat or finish. Though I informed our waiter, and he said he told the chef, no offer to compensate or replace meal was suggested. Will definitely not return."}
{"text":"To say I'm a fan of Tia Rosa's is a bit of an understatement. I fell in love with the green tomatillo salsa and black bean soup the first time I ate at the old location on University in 1993. Since their move to the present location, I've noticed one significant factor that always reminds me why I keep coming back. Consistency. 

Each bite of fish taco, carnitas or chicken mole tastes just as good as the first time I tried them. Sure, the cuisine is in no way bold or spicy (unless you ask for the habanero salsa...) but it is always fresh and flavorful. And sure there are the typical taco/burrito/quesadilla offerings, but the rest of the menu is what really shines. 

Try the Ancho Peach Chicken for example. Not a lot of heat, but a juicy seared chicken breast immersed in a delicious sweet peach glaze with just a hint of smoke. Or the Enchiladas Mariscos with their grilled white fish, sauteed shrimp and Montery Jack wrapped up nicely and covered in a creamy green sauce. And my favorite, the slow roasted shredded beef. I haven't been able to find anything that comes close to its savory, tender, char-grilled goodness anywhere in the Valley. 

Now, it is true that there is very little you can do to get around the long wait for a table aside from coming in at an off time. The physical property itself is quite charming if not a little kitchy but is starting to show some wear and tear. 

Every taste convinces me that Tia Rosa's isn't your average taco/enchilada joint but rather something special to be experienced."}
{"text":"Service has been great both times that we've dined. I wish their salsas were more authentic and not so sweet! Their green sauce was sweet like candy and even their red sauce was too sweet. I know some salsas are made to be sweet but that should be an option...I expect a spicy salsa delivered with chips! The food was pretty good but I would've loved it even more if I could've smothered it in some authentic salsa! Atmosphere is good but the booth seats are in pretty bad shape. Overall this wouldn't be a first choice or even a second choice of Mexican food for me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite salsas in the valley green and both red both have a great sweet flavor.  The pork here is extremely tender and a great smoked flavor to it.  Overall high quality Baka style Mexican one of my tops"}
{"text":"Saw it in the republic and decided to stop. My wife was not hungry but I had eaten hours before her. We got prompt service and soon had mexican beer on tap. My Modelo was the best. Chips and two salsas came soon and they were not hot so most people can eat them the chips were fresh and crisp. I ordered the Burrito with shredded beef and red sauce. It came with rice and beans. The beans contained a bit of bacon and were delicious. The Burrito was one of the best I have had. The beef was smoked or grilled and had the best tasting char to it. We will go back."}
{"text":"Tia Rosas is a gem of a find. The decor, the seating areas and the vibe are awesome. We have enjoyed the authentic Mexican fare, with huge serving sizes, and a cocktail or 2 as well. This is our only choice for our  Mexican food cravings. 
The servers are well trained, entertaining if you want some fun with them and they all appear to be happily at their work. They have staff to seat you and staff that clear tables. Our party was very impressed when we seem them wash the tables as well as give the booth seating a cleaning too, between customers. You never see that. This is also one of the very few establishments that have lots of staff so no waiting to be seated, tables cleaned or for service at your table. Well done.

Never tried authentic Mexican, give it a try. Ask questions or ask for servers favorited, they will happily take the time to explain what you will be enjoying. Maybe time to try something new, don't be shy just ask for some advice. Sit back relax and enjoy the atmosphere.

Looking forward to our next visit.

Ann and Shane Nantes, Ontario Canada"}
{"text":"great experience, great food , and great customer service. never knew it was located in the plaza that it is. we will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I've been a Rosa's regular for more than a decade (both in its original location at Mesa Drive and University and at the new expanded location since it opened in 2001). In our Rosa's heyday, we ate here at least once a week; now it's more a bimonthly experience. 

Overall takeaway - the food is consistently good, the guests we bring here always ask to come back (sometimes during the same visit), and if you can get past the noisy crowds and random mariachi minstrels, it's definitely worth a visit.

Chips and salsa are standouts - thin, crispy, warm chips with the fresh, complex green and red salsas. (Garlic alert: the green salsa stays with you for at least 24 hours - but worth it!) Menu faves include the seafood taco combo (sautéed shrimp taco with pineapple salsa and grilled salmon taco with orange mango salsa), the Flying Saucer (the beef, pork and chicken are all great, served on a crisp tortilla with beans, lettuce, salsa fresca, guacamole, sour cream, and cheese) and the Tia's Plato de Carne Asada (roasted, then chargrilled beef served with Spanish rice, beans, grilled vegetables and flour tortillas).

Note: This place is a cult favorite with lots of local groupies; as a result, there's usually a wait on Thurs, Fri and Saturday nights. Reservations or call-ahead seating are HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"Our family enjoyed tacos, tamales, quesadilla and all tasted great and reasonably priced. Large portions- so big we had no space for dessert. Looking forward to trying the flan next time. Loved the green tamale -never had it before and it was sweet and delicious. Nice ambiance. Thank You for a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"Pros: Nice, large outdoor seating area.

Cons: Weak drinks, looooong wait on drinks and food. Service was lacking for a weekday night.

Neither me nor my fiancee was very impressed by the service or drinks here. My food was good enough but probably because it just had so much cheese. My fiancee wasn't a real fan of his entree. I highly doubt we will be back unless we both get amnesia."}
{"text":"I had a long day at work and missed lunch on May 15, 2013.  While en route to picking up my children from school I stopped at Rancho de Tia Rosa cantina.  

When I came inside the cashier was clearing tables and said she would be right with me.  It took a few minutes (not as quick as their usual cashier service).  

\"Toni\"  took my order and I got their CHICKEN STUFFED QUESADILLA.   I paid and went out to check on my kids who stayed right outside the door in the a/c cooled car.  They decided that they were hungry after all. 

I came back inside to make a second order for my kids.  \"Toni\" took my order again.  I asked her if I could just have one large cup instead of 2 kids size with my two kids meals.  She seemed very confused.  She handed me a dirty cup with her fingers inside of the cup instead of holding it from the outside.  She was still confused.  I asked her for a clean cup and then she finally understood that I only needed 1 large beverage.  

She was a bit rude but the food was great!"}
{"text":"The food at Rancho de Tia Rosas is phenomenal, the flavors in their meat (beef, chicken and pork) have remarkable depth. It is hard to name a favorite entree since every menu item I have tried is so good but to name a few, the enchiladas with green sauce (out of this world!), shrimp tacos, and carne asada plate are all a must try. And you must stop in for Happy Hour if you can, excellent specials! The restaurant is not only decorated to perfection but also very clean and tidy.  Always great service, and servers are knowledgable in gluten free menu items.  I would thoroughly recommend Rancho De Tia Rosa to anyone who likes mexican food and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've been to RdTR on 4 separate occasions... each with the hope that the previous visits were just bad nights.  What can I say.  We live within a mile of the place and will never go back.
Dishes have always been prepared with a lack of focus and flavor that should define this cuisine.  I had their braised pork which was so dry, I would swear they used loin instead of shoulder.
On a separeate occasion, we brought out of town friends and they pointed out how interesting their 'smoked' refried beans were.  I tasted them and commented that there was no such thing.  Their beans were burnt.  Fish tacos - just ok.  Burritos - go elsewhere for 1/2 the price.  Rellenos - not really rellenos.

If you want real Mexican food, look elsewhere.  If you want to eat at a really charismatic place, wait for 45 minutes for a table and leave feeling like Garcias would have been more authentic, then this is your place.

UPDATE:  After moving away from Arizona and coming back to visit family, I relented and tried this place again.  I really want to like you Tia Rosa, but sadly, no change.  What is it?  Why?  This is a Mexican food place in ARIZONA and it should be the bomb.  But its not and I don't think ever will be.  I can't really tell why but it feels like there is a lack of soul."}
{"text":"Ugh.  Stopped here on a Monday night at about 7:30.  1 hour later we were finally seated.  Then we were told it would be another 30 to 40 min before we would get our food.  Once the food came I received pork enchildas vs the chicken i ordered.  Other items that were ordered was very dry and all of our meals were cold.  The carne asada that was ordered came out looking and tasting like a dry pot roast.The waitress was very nonchalent about the entire experience.  I really thought for mexican food in Az it would be an excellent meal. Oh and dont ask them to turn down the air conditioning (as it was extremely cold)  because if they did tge lights would go off. Skip this place and save your money."}
{"text":"Go for lunch and go before 11:30 or order out. Its crowded and loud and the food is pretty good. We eat here often, but I have had better at Matta's. Their enchiladas in red sauce and flying saucers with no dressing but with their green chili salsa are family favorites. The servers are fast and friendly. Parking is awful and the wait can get ridiculous at dinner time."}
{"text":"I ate here while visiting family and did not have a positive experience.  We were quickly seated but waited over 10 minutes for the waiter to come and ask if we would like water and to bring our chips and salsa.  He apologized and said they had and unexpected rush (it was 6pm on a friday, I think they call it dinner time).  The service continued to be lousy and the food left alot to be desired.  They obviously put alot more time and money into the ambiance then into their menu and service."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple weeks ago and it was about a 45 min.-1 hour wait.  I had the enchiladas and they were really good. What I got upset about is the waitress forgot to put our food in. She also did not check to see if we need another drink or refill on our drinks. My husband had a beer and was not asked once if he needed another one and she was no where to be found. They could have made more money on the beers. Once she remembered our existence she did apologize and was nice but how the hell can you forget about my meal. They seriously should have offered it to us for waiting a very long time while everyone else was getting served. I had to wave her down for her to check on our food.  Oh... The person serving us water was the best part of our experience because he made sure our water was always topped.  Very frustrating on how we were not compensated and we still tipped (not sure why).

I will however try it again in hopes of better customer service and will write another updated review. It may take me a while considering......  That's too bad because I eat a lot of mexican food and they are right down the street from me."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, would give it a negative rating if I could. I'll keep this review short. The food was disgusting,  salsa was brought to the table in plastic 'to go' cups and looked like it just came out of a jar. We had been here before but decided to give it a second chance. The first time we were here the food was bland and drowned in sauce and sugar. Nothing authentic about the place. We were seated and our waitress came to our table. She was in her 40's and looked miserable. She didn't greet us, just asked us what we wanted to drink. My boyfriend asked if their were any drinks made without tequila on the menu, and the waitress reply was, \"I don't know, look, it's my second day. They have a full bar so I guess they have something back there.' Then she just walked away. I looked at my boyfriend in shock and asked him if that really happened. The waitress came back a second later and asked us if we were ready to order. She was very blunt, very rude, and very pissed off sounding. No smile,  no introduction of her name. We asked again if she could help us with information about the menu and she just said she didn't know, then again walked away. It was so weird. We decided to just leave before ordering anything. Totally turned off by the food and the service. Save your time and money, go somewhere else. Anywhere else."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! We had planned a birthday dinner party for 16 people for over a month. I checked several times on arrangements, including the menu. I was assured everything was in place. When our party arrived we all had to stand outside in 106 degree sun for over 45 minutes after our reservation time. Then they could not sit our entire party together, so 6 members had to sit at another table several feet away. Then they gave my guests the wrong menu. After all this, one of my guests asked for extra sour cream and they had the nerve to charge me a dollar extra for it. My husband's 70 th birthday party was a huge disappointment thanks to Tia Rosa. I complained to manager and got an email reply saying he would \"coach his staff.\" After reading other reviews it sounds like more than coaching is needed. At least he could have offered to refund my dollar for the sour cream! I would have spent it at many of the other Mexican Restuarants we could have chosen!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!! I sat at the bar after a long stressful day of work and ordered the chips and salsa. I know what you're thinking, \"there's no way a restaurant could mess up something as simple as chips and salsa\" but ladies and gentlemen I'm here to tell you that they did. To my horror, the chips came out with chunks of fried napkin!!! This place is about as worthless as a shovel on a sea barge. Again, DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at almost every Mexican restaurant in the valley... this is by far my favorite!  Known for their Shrimp Tacos (with Pineapple Salsa) and Salmon Tacos (with Mango Salsa).  The Tomatillo Sauce is the best I have ever had.  When visitors come from out of town... this is the first place we take them!"}
{"text":"We used to love eating at Rosa's. Now that this restaurant is under new ownership it seems to struggle to find competent employees. We've been here several times since they reopened and the service is always terrible. We kept hoping it would get better. Tonight The green sauce is so spicy my dinner wasn't edible. They have obviously changed the recipe. My mouth was on fire and my water cup had been empty for minutes with no wait staff in sight to get a refill. I'm sad to say I'm disappointed and may not be back. This place used to be our \"go to restaurant\" now we are looking for a different option. Management needs to train their wait staff. I don't know if any of these servers have ever served before."}
{"text":"Good carne, good service! The salsa is boring though....I had to ask for some hotter stuff. Too bad I missed happy hour."}
{"text":"This place burned down and the taqueria in the same parking lot was purchased by someone else. It was the worst meal of my life. Literally not one redeeming quality. Got the shrimp fajitas - completely inedible. Bad tortillas, worst overcooked/burnt shrimp, disgusting refried beans... I could go on and on. No one else's food was good either. No one should ever come here. Ever."}
{"text":"Great!!! It's the restaurant that people in the East Valley go to when they have visitors in town. It's a big restaurant, but it's ALWAYS packed.

If you like fish or shrimp tacos, then definitely try the ones here."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are great but they get a low rating because every time I go there the bar is full of children that are screaming or running around.  They are close to my work but the last thing I want after a hard day is to go to a bar for drinks, food, conversation, or to watch a game, and be sitting next to a table of 3 or 4 kids in a bar.  Even the several times coworkers and I have gone there for lunch to relax, there has always been a table in the bar with 3 or 4 young children.  Often being loud and throwing things like their menus around.     They have several screens with games on. But this bar is never going to be a place where many people want to come unwind with the bar full of loud children. They need to take a lesson from Red Robin (who's bar is always packed) and make it 21 and over only.  On my last visit I heard a guy at the next table who was annoyed by 3 loud children seated in the bar say, maybe the bar should have a toddler section. The mother was oblivious and stayed on her cell phone for at least 10 minutes while the children entertained themselves and made noise.  I would say that 5 of my last 6 visits, there have been loud children in the bar. My coworkers and I will have to look for another place to stop after work and for lunch."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone.  The food is not what everyone else makes it out to be.  The restaurant owner really seems to like it though because they charge an arm and a leg for the lame entrees. 

We were told by our server that we could not have any custom orders.  All we asked for was an additional enchilada on a  children's plate.  This request was way too complex for anyone at the restaurant to execute.  STAY AWAY!!  My family and I will never return.  It's a shame because we live within walking distance."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times already and I'm very happy that it opened a Chandler location.  It's relatively new so I feel some of the posts on service may be due to that, although I'll tell you that I've never experienced bad service.  We were seated promptly and the staff was courteous.

I agree with the other reviews that visually it's exactly what you want to be surrounded by as you sip a margarita.

The best part really is the food.  It's not the typical Mexical food formula, it's creatively put together and delicious.  The Baja menu section is really my favorite part.  The Shrimp Mazatlan is amazing.  The kids menu is also very good.  I've been there as a part of a large family group and on a date and it works either way."}
{"text":"I love the decor here & dinner has always been good but now there is breakfast! The French toast is amazing! The orange sauce is fantastic! Always a good place but there is usually a wait."}
{"text":"Good happy hour but not a fan of the food. Even the chips and salsa wasn't appealing.  Tried a couple of times but not the same as the McDowell or Mckellips road location"}
{"text":"We went there this morning and it was great! My wife had their Green Chile Pork Breakfast Burrito, I had Chillaquilles (not sure if that is how it is spelled) with chorizo with some green chile pork on the side, and my daughter had the waffle with berries, whip cream, and home made strawberry and blueberry syrups! It was all amazing! I know where we will be going next time for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I created a Yelp ID just to write this review. In the past the Taqueria has been one our favorite places for something better than fast food. Unfortunately, the level of service has been on a general decline over the past year or so, culminating in the following experience two weeks ago. (I waited a couple of weeks to post since I sent an email about my experience, but received not reply.)

We called in our order. It took 20 minutes of repeated dialing to finally get through, only to be put on hold for another 5 minutes. We placed our order and were told it would be ready in 25 minutes. We arrived in exactly 25 minutes, only to stand in line for another 10 minutes. (One person on the cash register, line to the door, no express line for call ahead.) By the time we received our order, the food was cold."}
{"text":"I recommend the beef nachos at happy hour , a meal for 2 or 3 . Delicious marinated beef."}
{"text":"This is the place on everyone's lips right now - always crowded!  We tried it on a Friday night and somehow got seated in less than ten minutes.  Guess everyone wanted outside seating in the beautiful weather.  Ordered a shot on the menu that sounded yummy - but wasn't.   Cheese crisp was burnt.  Green salsa, as others have said was sweet but I loved it.  Food was good but not great.  The shining star in our meal was the server, Tara.  She was very on top of everything even though very busy.  And I was impressed that she asked my permission before serving my 11 year old refills on soda.  We may or may not try this again.  Wanted to be thrilled since it is within walking distance."}
{"text":"When we went there, it was crowded,  so we put our name on the list.   They kept calling names, but not ours, 25 minutes later, we walked up to check, they had crossed our name off, like we had been seated, but we were never called. The person standing there said, oh I can seat you right now. No, I'm sorry, or anything. Okay, so we got a table, it didn't get better. Waiter came after 10 minutes, No water was offered. He took our order, and turned to walk away, we had to tell him wait, can we get a drink? No salt\pepper on the table. 
The salsa was not good. I make better salsa at home.  
I had tamale plate, I will say, it was very good. My husband had Chicken enchiladas, he said they were good, but Chili's are better.
The noise was way over the top, it's definitely not a place to go and relax after a long work day. We went once to the old location, 8 years ago, we didn't go back, it wasn't good. But, gave the Gilbert location a try, won't go back. 
We'll keep going to La Parrilla Suiza, they have never disappointed us in 8 years.
Sorry to say, but your Hostess people are incompetent."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! I love the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. The chips are thin and crispy, and the salsa is great! I've been here several times and the service is always good and faster than you would expect for a large busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE best molé sauce I've tasted in eons. All the food was outstanding. Good value for cost. House marg was really tasty -- not too sweet, and no junk filler. Service was 5* and the restaurant, back garden and front patio spaces are absolutely beautiful. A visual feast for the eyes. They are easily set up to provide intimate space for two and expanded space for a large family. I hope I get to return."}
{"text":"We have eaten at all the local Mexican restaurants in the area and this place is at the top of our list. The salsa and chips have their own distinct flavor not to be found anywhere else. Service has never been a problem and always has been back to the table to ask if everything is ok and if we need anything else. The food is top notch, i almost asked for another order. Overall it is a positive dining experience and i will always be a returning customer."}
{"text":"1 star an only because 0 isn't available. Back again, for more punishment. GOD I can't wait for a better place to open nearby. There is nowhere else to go nearby so we have to come here out of lack of options. The customer service is the worst I have ever seen. Food is good, patio is nice, service is atrocious! How the servers will drop something off at one table and not even address the new table who just sat next to it is unbelievable! HORRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"We've been going to this place for years.  Very tasty drinks and food.  And the atmosphere is really great with the decor and exterior patios.  Decorator details will have you looking at every inch of the place.  Once the food arrives you won't be disappointed.  Stuffed quesidillas are always a hit and my husband never deviates from the carne asada.  Downside is that it is always busy so you always have to wait.  But worst part is once seated it is really loud.  You're really packed in so hard to carry on a conversation if you're with a larger party.  Try for patio seating if the weather permits."}
{"text":"Love this joint!  Great food- the best horchata a gringo could ever have. Also, the management and staff are as good as it gets!  A definite Gilbert staple!  If you havnt eaten here- you havnt lived!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great happy hour menu, huge variety of margaritas. Tacos are the best!
My daughter gets sick of me always wanting to come here, although she always likes he food."}
{"text":"Saw this place in a magazine and decided to go here for lunch. That was like the best decision ever! This is now my absolute favorite Mexican food restaurant! The restaurant itself is just amazingly beautiful. You can tell that they put a lot of work into this place. They even have a green house out back where they get their vegetables fresh daily. My ultimate favorite thing is the chicken enchiladas. You cannot go wrong with this! Oh yeah and the refried beans are amazing! This is honestly the best Mexican food I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Like the food, but the service had really declined since the new owners took over. Arrived on a busy night and was told 25-30 minute wait. OK. While waiting we were told \"The kitchen is backed up. It will be another 30 minutes.\" Really? I've never heard this before at ANY other restaurant except this one! This was the second time this had happened to us here. Lots of angry customers. The dining room was half empty before they started dating people again. Any kitchen should be able to run a full restaurant on a busy night! Done with this place."}
{"text":"Food was good! Service was alright! Would defiantly come back. We we're say promptly. Server came to the table to get drinks. Soon after we ordered. Food took a while but they were busy. Can't complain I'm happy over all!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!! I am a regular Uber eats user and I was sad to see that our favorite Mexican restaurant Garcia was no longer available. We decided to give this place a try and could not have been more disappointed. Horrible bland nasty food a complete waste of money no one in my family ate their meals I would never recommend this place or reorder from them."}
{"text":"Would give the food 4.5 stars, but since they reopened you wait 15-20 min just to get your drink.

{"text":"One Friday afternoon when driving through Mesa, Arizona with my family, a little yellow restaurant with a glowing sign that reads \"Rancho De Tia Rosa,\" caught my attention.  As we walked towards the authentic terra cotta building, I could hear the exuberant Spanish music playing inside. Once we walked through the doorway and could smell the traditionalMexican food in the air, making us decide to give the restaurant a try. As we waited to be seated at our table, we noticed that the stone walls were filled with vivid paintings anddecorated with native musical 
instruments. Our friendly hostess handed us the menu's and asked what I would like to drink. \"Orchata.\" I said. Which is a refreshing milk, rice and cinnamon flavored drink, served over ice. She smiled and immediately worked her way through the crowded restaurant towards the kitchen, while I was left to decide which entree I would like to indulge in. 
After carefully reading over the extensive menu, my mother recommended the \"Plato de Chimichanga.\"  This dish included: shredded beef served with Spanish rice and beans, topped with sour cream, guacamole, and cheese. When the waitress returned with our drinks,  I gave her my order and she took the menu from me stating that would be \"just a moment.\" As I waited, my family began to talk and I leaned back into my chair to get a better look around the room. Outside there was a patio where I could see people laughing and enjoying their meals. It reminded me so much of Mexico and everything around me made it feel as if I were far away from the place i once used to call home. As the sun began to set, there was a relatively large tree in the center of the patio that began to illuminate with bright lights which distracted me from noticing that my food had already been served. Before I could say thank you, the waitress was gone in a rush to bring more food to the other customers. I was very surprised at how quick the service was, considering it was so crowded on a late Friday afternoon. As I looked at my colorful plate filled with food, I could only imagine how much of it would be left over. To my amazement, I ate every last bit. Although I am not much of a beef person, that did not stop me from eating my entire meal. The seasoned yellow rice with beans, slow cooked savory tender beef and various other seasonings made a great and unique combination to this traditional chimichanga. The \"Plato de Chimichanga\" was also served with a petite side salad including crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes and a small radish in the center. The food at Rancho de Tia Rosa is so simple with basic ingredients, yet so delicious that I would highly recommend anyone who visit's this restaurant for the first time should try this dish. The people are friendly, the service is quick and most of all the atmosphere is a perfect getaway from your everyday life."}
{"text":"I am not much of a mexican food fan, but this was a very nice restaurant that had a lot of variety.  Besides the waiter accidentally spilling a margarita (which was very tasty) on a person in our party, the service was excellent.

The pork was wonderful.  The shrimp tacos were absolutely delectable!  The chips were fresh and pleantiful.  Salsas were very good also.

I can't believe how busy it got while we were there.  Obviously a hot spot in this part of town.  I can see why."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch with a former boss. I ordered two carne asada tacos with rice and beans and an horchata. 

The two tacos came out on a slop of soggy lettuce. Now, this is where things get blurry. The two corn tortillas that held the carne asada filling pretty much disintegrated upon lifting the taco. Was the lettuce soggy from the excess juice in the tacos? Was the taco soggy from water in the lettuce? How long was it left sitting, that this even happened before it hit my table? Either way, I ended up having to eat my carne asada meat with a fork while I picked out the corn tortilla mush and soggy lettuce shreds. Even then, the carne asada was very bland and the lettuce was so wilted down that I could not even make a make-shift salad. 

The horchata! I had hoped that this would be awesome like almost every horchata I have ever had in my life. No dice. It was watered down. Heavily. It was more like tap water with an essence of horchata. I used it as a filler for silence during conversation with my companion, so I drank most of it before my meal came. Even after my meal arrived, I was still waiting on a refill from the poorly attentive waitress. Not even my poor essence of horchata water could salvage this experience. As much as I hate saying it, because I actually like my former boss, I am glad I did not pay for this. I will stick to Filiberto's if I want Mexican food (and a massive cheap and delicious horchata) or I will just save a few bucks and make it myself, thanks.

On a side note, the waitress was mean. Not to us, but to the poor worker that was cleaning up around the tables. She pointed and ordered/scolded the worker to do stuff. She explained how the owner would feel about things not being done a certain way and humiliated her, in a not so quiet voice. I felt so much sympathy for that worker. I will not be back nor will I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Rancho de Tia Rosa's and Taqueria gets 5 STARS for Best Fish and Shrimp Tacos! Best Chicken Mole! Best Chimichanga! Best Tomatillo Salsa Verde! And Best Place to Take Your Out-Of-Towners!  

We have been going to Tia Rosa's with our family for what seems like over 15 or more years now, starting with their original Mesa Drive and University location as well as the second East McKellips and newly opened Gilbert restaurant at Higley and Warner.

I originally heard about Rosa's reading a New Time's Best of Phoenix review and first  we tried the \"Plato de Chimichanga\" with oven roasted and marinated for two days beef or pork.  All in all it got 5 STARS and has been my wife Karolien's favorite and staple for many years since.  This dish earns your loyalty and respect with it's tender taste!  Includes Spanish Rice and delicious smoked beans topped with sour cream, plenty of guacamole and cheese!  She also loves their Pineapple Avocado Salad and has order another Mango Salad in the past which she swears by!

\"Why I keep coming back time and time again?\"; Rosa's gets TOP HONORS FIVE STARS as the BEST TAQUERIA in the Valley of the Sun hands down for their Beef, Chicken, Pork, or what I always order fresh Fish and Shrimp soft tacos! 

Their Baja Style Sauted Shrimp Tacos with pineapple salsa are what they say; \"To Die For!\" Juicy and tender I have never found any other contenders even on the beaches in Mexico!  I love to top the shrimp taco with Rosa's Best Green Tomatillo Salsa Award that I have yet to find.  Be aware the green is very  addictive! 

The fish soft taco either your choice of grilled Salmon or Halibut comes stuffed with red Cabbage and Orange Mango Salsa are my absolute favorites.  Are you kidding me!  Anyone looking for the BEST SEAFOOD, FISH OR SHRIMP TACOS IN PHOENIX YOUR LOOK IS OVER....DRIVE TO THE EAST VALLEY!  The 2 item plate comes with delicious Spanish Rice and those oooohhhh so good smoked baked beans!

It even gets better as I absolutely love Tia's \"Plato de Carne Asada\" which I understand is a 12 spice marinated beef or pork slowly oven roasted for 10 hours, and then charbroiled over an open flame!  It comes to your table smoking hot and I love many flavors and so get the combo Beef, Pork, and Chicken!  Put it this way I am getting hungry just thinking about how good this dish is!  

I forgot to mention Rosa's takes the prize for Best Chicken Mole!  Which includes six varieties of chilies, 22 spices, herbs, nuts, fruits and chocolate blended together in this classic Mexican sauce. It comes garnished with sesame seeds and served with rice and tortillas!  This sauce is king!  Delicious and never greasy!  It is a true art to have an award winning Mole! 

So grab the whole family and set a date for Rosa's and Rancho de Tia Rosa's in Mesa and Gilbert, call ahead on weekends to get placed on the waiting list, you will not be disappointed and any miles driven will be well rewarded!  They have earned every one of these FIVE STAR Awards as good as it gets!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a very popular spot. Beans and rice are excellent! The salsas are too sweet and not spicy enough. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix for about 25 years and tried a lot of the mexican restaurants as I am on the road for work and Tia Rosas has, arguably, the best tacos in the valley .(according to my gringo palate).  There are some who love real hot mexican, this is probably not the place for you, but if you like medium heat , great flavors and marinated meats, then this is the place.  I read some negative reviews about the chips and salsa and I could not disagree more.  The chips are thin and light, not greasy and the salsa is mild, chunky with notes of lime, excellent!"}
{"text":"Yes. I will give you a call after this weekend. I can assure you that was the only food we has in common in a while. We were 5 in the table. Only me and her had the same food. The rest thanksfully didnt get sick"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time to honor my father after he died.  This was one of his long standing favorite haunts for good Mexican food.

I was NOT disappointed and could see immediately why he loved this place.

Come as you are; be in dressed to the nines or in your favorite worn to a frazzle blue jeans.  Just be sure to bring a big appetite because the food is tasty and plentiful.  Prices are very reasonable.

I had the chile relleno - very good.  Chips were thin, crisp and hot and never ending without having to ask for refills.

The ambience is fun and fabulous.  The decor is something right out of a sumptuous Mexican hacienda.  If you have never been to Mexico but would like the feel of  being there then this is the place.

Intimate rooms for a cozy tete a tete, large rooms designed to accomodate the largest banquet or charming out door seating plus a very friendly bar area.  Whatever type of dining experience you crave Tia Rosa's can accomodate you.

The wait staff was very attentive and the food and Margaritas were amazingly delicious!

{"text":"Used to love this place but since the new management, the food became bland and boring."}
{"text":"I can't comment much on service as I had my order to go. They send you to the bar to place your order. I ordered a drink while I looked at the menu, never got offered chips and salsa. I ordered the Nuevo Chilie Relleno and it was delish!"}
{"text":"The red salsa and chips were good, the green salsa was way too sweet for my taste.  I ordered the seafood tacos and it came with rice OR beans, not both which I thought was odd.  I ordered the beans, which were quite tasty.  Regarding the seafood tacos, the shrimp themselves were good, nice a large, but overall the shrimp taco was quite sweet with the pinapple salsa that was on it.  The fish tacos were just okay.  

Overall I think this restaurant is very Disney-esque with its theme and caters to the local crowd (bland) and is not very authentic.  I will stick to Los Dos Molinos or Blue Adobe."}
{"text":"Tia Rosas deserves a full five star rating because of the awesomely priced happy hour and the amazing food and service I had at normal dinner hours tonight (Sat October 25). Tonight my server was,  I believe,  named Spencer who gave plentiful information for all the dishes we questioned. He even answered some questions about the other location (which is gone now) and overall was an awesome guy! I will continue to go here as long as service will be this good and prices stay this low! Oh! One More thing, the atmosphere is cozy and very detailed."}
{"text":"Thank you Dennis ! TIA ROSAS FOOD AND GREEN SALSA IS ALWAYS AMAZING. This review is regarding the manager Dennis. We had a slight issue with a to-go order and he immediatly came over and asked what he could do to help. He was attentive, apologetic and actually seemed to care. Most managers/staff will apologize but you can tell they really could care less. We always love the food at Tia Rosa's (they even catered our wedding) so it does get old when our to go order gets messed up every other time we go. Dennis was amazing and if it wasn't for his customer service we would have left annoyed and most likely given up on eating there. He was amazing. As a business owner myself, I know how hard it is to find a great team/manager you trust. I hope the owners are aware of what an asset they have with Dennis! We will be back for sure. !"}
{"text":"I don't get what all the fuss is about. Perhaps I expected too much? We came in on a Tuesday around 1:30pm and there was a 15 minute wait. We figured it must be good! Our waiter was friendly and interactive. We ordered two lunch specials  with a beef taco and beef flautas. Although not rave-worthy, the meat was great and stands out from other places. Unfortunately, the main reason why we won't be back is because of the hostess. She was incredibly rude! She had a \"I'm too good to serve you\" attitude. At one point, I thought we had left our daughters diaper bag in the lobby so I went back to check but didn't see it. The lobby was empty and the hostess was standing there looking at a piece of paper. I approached her and explained that I may have left a bag on the bench and if perhaps she had seen it. She never bothered to look up at me as I was talking until after I finished and all she said was \"excuse me?\" Really? You just ignored me this whole time? It sucks when the food is good but the staff is the reason why they've lost your business."}
{"text":"We have tried this place numerous times attempting to give them a second chance after \"re-opening\".  Our last try was a disaster.  The service has always been mediocre and the food has declined greatly. 
Supporting small businesses in Gilbert has always been priority to myself and my family; and I will always give them a second try but after a third try with this place - it's done. 
Our server Richelle provided us with less than mediocre service. She introduced herself and mentioned she would have someone \"shadowing\" her. We asked for water, cocktails and an appetizer. The chips and salsa, that they charge you for, were delivered to the table immediately. About ten minutes later our cocktails were delivered along with our water. I would think it would be much easier to bring water to our table immediately since the restaurant was empty. 
The chips are paper thin and the green salsa is sweet and the red tastes like it's out of a jar. There's no flavor whatsoever. 
When our appetizer nachos arrived they were very soggy due to the thin chips. We asked for a spicier sauce that was supposedly \"hot\" according to our waitress, it too turned out to be mediocre. 

After that we decided to go home and Door Dash some better options for more authentic Mexican food. 
Our waitress only appeared at the table three times, once to take our order, once asking about our food and delivering our \"spicy/bland\" sauce and finally to deliver our check. She seemed too busy gossiping about other restaurants and their lack of \"customer service\". 
As mentioned earlier, we will not be returning to this restaurant due to mediocre service and taste-less food. 
If you're looking for better Mexican food options, look elsewhere because this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Been there fifty times. My favorite place to eat Mexican food. I drive 20 miles roundtrip just to enjoy their awesome shrimp and fish tacos (get them with guacamole). Service is friendly, food is prepared fast, and it is always outstanding. The best bean and cheese burro I've had: it has a smoky flavor that knocks me out. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was such a let down. It has such great potential with its gorgeous atmosphere. For starters they allow NO substitutions. If you want your sizzling chicken fajitas do not come here. They only allow pulled chicken,pulled pork and pulled beef. when I asked the manager why they would not substitute pan seared chicken (since they apparently have no grill) he told me that it was too \"laborous\" to do so and it was was easier to let a pot of shredded chicken sit on the grill and use it as needed. The mini shrimp quesadilla was NOT a quesadilla at all. It was on a small open faces corn tortilla that had not been grilled or anything and not ONLY that, there was NO cheese on this so called QUESAdilla. The tortilla soup was like a liquified cow lick. The amount of sodium in this soup could send someone to the hospital if the whole thing were eaten. the margaritas did not taste \"fresh & made with orange juice\" it tasted like a mix you could buy in the store. 

Overall this was a HORRIBLE experience from the customer service to the food. I would not recommend any one to come here seeing as there are many other Mexican restaurants that deserve the support of patrons."}
{"text":"OK, I'm going to admit living in the 'Dale I have no reference for good Mexican food as I'm not sure it exists there.  However the experience and food at Tia Rosa has been so gut-bustingly fantastic I have to give this place a fiver!

The Tia Rosa style fajitas with carne asada is amazing, tender, and has a ridiculous amount of flavor.  It's not a traditional carne but fantastic nonetheless.  I can't bring myself to order anything else, but apparently there are other menu options as well.  The chips and salsa is fuh-ree and includes the verde, regular, and hot stuff upon request--I recommend you make that request.

The only two negatives--one of which would normally be a -1 star--are a lack of beer on tap and no hot sauce available!  I can grudgingly live with the beer issue, and I've solved the hot sauce problem by bringing my own Cholula.  I'm not sure if the Little Lady was entertained or embarassed.  Anyways, keep in mind it's BYOHS and get out to RDTR for some fantastic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I could have dealt with how loud this place is but after they stuck a family with 5 kids next to us with uninterested adult supervision, I just wanted to escape. Don't waste your money.  Bad food, really bad ambience, and hostesses trained in a special education setting.  I felt sorry for the server that she had to work there.  She was the only positive from the experience."}
{"text":"It really bothers me when a Mexican restaurant does not offer single tacos and enchiladas. They force you to buy the dinners and do not allow any substitutions."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food, wonderful atmosphere.  Always happy to find a great place to eat Mexican food when I am out of San Diego.  We went here on Mother's Day and all the moms got 'Hot Tamales' candy.  There is a big parking lot and we had no trouble finding a spot in the lot."}
{"text":"First time here.  Overall this restaurant is the best Mexican restaurant I've eaten at since I moved here about 2 years ago.  I'm not a fan of the salsa but my wife loved the margarita she had and the tamales.  I had the carne asada which I also enjoyed. We also had some desert the mexican flan and the sopapilla.  The flan was pretty good the sopapilla was good but the honey that came with was not appetizing at all.  I would recommend this restaurant to my friends.  Can't wait to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Love the smokey meat flavor.  Any of the meats are a hit.  The green salsa and the corn keep me coming back though. The fish tacos are great too.

Please reopen the Germann location!"}
{"text":"I'm waiting for  the McKellips restaurant to open again after the fire in March.  We lived in San Miguel de Allende in central Mexico for ten years and can appreciate all the many regional cuisines throughout Mexico. I think this restaurant has taken dishes from many areas of Mexico, some unfamiliar to those who only know Americanized dishes or one region. A good friend loves Tia Rosa and took us there shortly before the fire. All five of us enjoyed the experience very much, though our differing tastes reacted differently to our meals. I had the pork chile verde burrito and loved it. My partner had an enchilada dish and wanted more heat.  I tipped the roving mariachis five bucks to hear \"Las Mañanitas\" which is the Mexican version of \"Happy Birthday to You\" but far prettier. The setting is beautiful and felt very much like our favorite restaurants in Mexico. Some of the dishes we didn't get to sounded authentic from the menu descriptions, others sounded Americanized. But most of their Mesa customer base probably wouldn't want some authentic dishes that I learned to love. Overall on the basis of one visit I was very pleased with Tia Rosa and hope it reopens soon. The other location isn't as convenient for us but we'll probably go there soon in the meantime."}
{"text":"Went to scope out the place for a potential birthday party. The restaurant itself was nice and I really liked the atmosphere and decor. But then the food came...I don't know what that was, but it was not like any Mexican food I've ever had. Disgusting. The chips and salsa were nothing special but the food at the tables around me looked good so it didn't bother me. I had the Tia Rosa Burrro. After the first bite I could not eat anymore. The red enchilada sauce tasted sort of sweet and spaghetti sauce-like flavor. Weird. And the meat? Ugh. It was like pot roast but gross. The rice and beans? Flavorless.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"I love the salads here the best ,, started a diet and nice to know placebo go . The service was wondr ful and the atmosphere enjoyable. We are new to this area  and it will be our favorite mexican food."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was really good. The patio is beautiful. Wen enjoyed this place. The inside décor is just typical. But we liked it so much better that El Palacio."}
{"text":"Meet my sister here for happy hour and absurdity feel in love. The drinks where great, and a good price. The happy hour food is fresh, delicious, and  is a good serving. I had the tacos and nacho's."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the most ineffectively managed restaurant I have ever had the displeasure of interacting with.  We arrived with most of our party.

They would not let us sit.  They were rude and they made us wait for the crowd.

Poorly done.  Rudely dealt with."}
{"text":"Worst device possible...Manager told me to fuck myself when I asked for slasa and chips.....That's extra...What a joke....Terrible service waitress staff is unfriendly ...They hope you come and never come back. At least that's how they act...Do yourself a favor and never ever eat at or support this restaurant"}
{"text":"Don't think I'd come back- food was okay- very little spice. Service was poor.  Charged extra for black beans even though it was an option on the menu.  Took margaritas away before we were done.  Not sure what folks see in this place....I can get much better Mexican food in Chicago.  It gets two stars because the margaritas were good."}
{"text":"I'm picky, but I've found that there are two things Tia Rosa's does really well:  their chile rellenos, and also anything with beef in it. their chile rellenos are non-traditional, almost, I would say, New Mexico style, but they are now my favorite rellenos anywhere. and the beef comes out nice and tender and flavorful. I would highly recommend this place, but it does get crowded on weekends (way crowded!). I try to go for lunch. :)"}
{"text":"This is not a review, just a tip.  Restaurant is closed and fenced off, so don't waste your time driving to the Mesa location.  Yelp and the restaurant website both need to be updated to reflect this."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. Stevie is a fantastic waiter, he is smart, quick witted, and is well versed on customer satisfaction.  Tia rosa' s has a few flaws but Stevie surely erases any negativity of the operation of this newly managed business.  The new management would be wise to listen to this young  professional man who has a lot of great charisma along with his sister they are a great asset to Rancho Tia Rosa's  future. We'll keep coming back as the chef is excellent and the food is outstanding. Great dinner as always. Thanks Stevie!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Eat there as often as I can. I always order the carne asada every time I go. The chips and salsa they bring you before dinner are delicious. I always leave there feeling full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Mexican food, so chips and salsa has to be good, check!  Choice of fountain or bottled soda, good service and excellent food.  Been twice, same great experience both times.  Great to have in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place had the best Mexican food around! Why did they close?! It was one of the only unique and delicious restaurants near by!"}
{"text":"We get take-out from the McKellips Taqueria about once a month. The staff are always fast and the food is great. 

The flying saucers are out of this world (heh) fantastic -- my fave is the chicken. Note: when I order a flying saucer for take-out, I always order an extra shell, because by the time the food makes it home, the shell can be rather soggy, which ruins the fun. They have always obliged and put it in a separate container. 

The shrimp tacos (soft) and the rolled tacos (beef or chicken) are also great, and I love their salsa. The chips are a bit boring unless they are served hot -- then they taste great."}
{"text":"Went here before seeing Camelot at the Tuscany Theatre next door. (The show at Tuscany was awesome, but the pre-show food at Tia Rosa was meh.)

I debated between two and three stars. The food was tasty, so I went with three. But the service was slow and not very thoughtful. Which is a weird thing to say, I know, but what I mean is that we were given chips and salsa, but no water, and it took a good while for our server to come to take our drink orders. We were ready to order food when she finally came, and we decided to split the nachos appetizer. The drinks took forever to arrive, and had to ask for water as well (if you serve free chips, you should also automatically bring water, I think). 

Shortly after our drinks arrived, the nachos came on a big overflowing plate, which the food guy delivered and set in between us, but didn't bring any plates for us, and he was gone before we realized how awkward it would be. Spent the next 8-10 minutes trying to find our server so we could get plates while the food got cold. Tried to eat some without a plate and since the chips are thin, mine broke and landed face down on the tablecloth...it was just not the experience I was hoping for. Sigh. Plus we sat outside and apparently there was an ant farm under our table. Soon ants were crawling over our feet and legs. Bleh.

Paying the check took a long time, too. We were ready to get out of there.

Anyway, the nachos tasted great (we got the beef topping) and the salsa is good. Maybe everybody was having an off night or something. I'll try going back again sometime."}
{"text":"Very unhappy. We had a relative come into town after a long flight and we decided to go to Tia Rosa for dinner. I was working and could not get away on time. My wife and kids along with my father in law and our out of town guest arrived and placed their name on the wait list. After waiting 15 or 20 minutes, they were called ( party of six but I had not arrived yet so it was only 5) they were now told that they would have to wait until I arrived to be seated. I had told my wife what to order so that when I arrived (which was 15 minutes later) I could just eat and no one would have to wait. They refused and said they had to wait for me. My wife and party agreed to wait. I arrived after 15 minutes and we then waited another 10 minutes to be seated. The refusal to let our party be seated is probably one of the most moronic and idiotic management policies I have aver seen. Oh by the way, I was a restaurant general manager for over 10 years and would never do this to a customer. I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN TIA ROSA EVER AGAIN AND WILL LET EVERYONE I KNOW TO GO SOME WHERE ELSE.  (P.S. food was average in my honest opinion)"}
{"text":"Ate at the Mesa location 4/3/12 based on Yelp reviews. Very festive atmosphere. I had the Carne Asada, my wife had the Pollo Asada, my son the make your own tacos. All were great, as well as the margaritas."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch, service is good, place is clean and orderly. The beans have a hint of southern goodness and side of queso dip is good and pairs with all of the food well."}
{"text":"I strongly encourage anyone looking for an awesome Mexican restaurant to go to Rancho De Tia Rosa. The food, bartenders, and our waiter Dennis were phenomenal !!"}
{"text":"My family enjoyed this place over the years, and my son loves to go and grab a bite when we're back in Arizona.  The food has gone downhill lately, though, so we're going to some of the newer spots for Mexican these days.  
Also, unfortunately, the owner is so rude we won't be going back.  He yelled at my son like an angry father.  He was so ballistic that it seemed like a candid camera joke.  The owner has real anger management issues.  Unfortunately, my son was really caught off guard by the anger in the owner's voice.  He doesn't really have any adults like that in his life."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a higher recommendation.  I can't.  Food is good, not great and overpriced.  Notoriously bad service and it comes from the very top.  If you are wanting salsa beware, they bring out one little 2oz dish of red and 2oz dish of green salsa with a very small basket of chips for an entire table & good luck getting anymore salsa with your meal.  I met a group a friends there and was late, it was about 8:30pm.  The staff seemed concerned that their kitchen closed at 9.  Since my party was all finished with their dinner and lingering to chat,  I asked the waiter if they could do a quick simple bean burro.  He said they could.   Burro came, not the best burro, the one at their taqueria is not only bigger but better for $3.00.   I expected this one might cost me as much as $8.00.  Then the bill came:  $14.99 for that bean and cheese burro.   Really??? I'm mostly frustrated with myself for trying this place again, they haven't changed."}
{"text":"Probably the best authentic Mexican in Mesa. Very clean, cool atmosphere, and the service has always been top notch. The food isn't the greasy/cheesy type, more fresh and flavorful than most mexican places. Good chips & salsa. I always ordered the Carne Asada, and was blown away every time. The meats are what matters, and this place has it down. That's why the carne asada works, since it's just a huge serving of glorious meat, grilled veggies, rice and beans.

Tacos were pretty good, everything else has been great. Since Mesa lacks originality and flavor, go here and you won't be let down."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful.  The staff is friendly.  Good chips and salsa.  Did not like the food!  Everything is sweet!  Yuck!  I judge a Mexican restaurant by its sauces and its rice and beans. Awful!!  The beans were majorly under salted and the rice was flat.  This is not a traditional Sonoran Mexican food restaurant.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Although the place is beautiful, the food was horrible. Worst salsa EVER, it tasted store bought. The fish taco was barely edible, poor quality fish and it was $11. I ordered a Patron margarita, since I like tequila, and it tasted like water! We told the waitress, and she got me a new one, but it was only slightly better and I still don't think it was Patron. They charge for chips & salsa...the food is expensive and they charge for chips too?? Would not go back!!!"}
{"text":"Had the carne machada and it was very good. Everything was clean and the waiter was on top of things. Overall a great experience.

(2nd time) Even better! Had the sweet pork enchilada. Amazing."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you are looking to have a good time.  While the bar staff was nice the manager here is terrible.  If looking to meet up with friends for a fun happy hour their's only runs till 5.  They only had 1 happy hour menu for the whole bar.  The manager was rude.  DO NOT GO HERE FOR FUN!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill since it reopened. The service is slow and inattentive. Food is actually decent but pretty over priced for what else is close. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"The food definitely above average. Portions are very large. Prices are reasonable.

Parking is horrendous for any normal busy night. My advice is to park in the business area that is just West of the restaurant. It is a small walk but well worth it than getting stuck in the regular parking area and not even find a space.

So that was the quick and dirty.

Here is why it lost a star for me. We had reservations 2 days prior for a Friday night and we called back to verify on that day. We knew it was going to be busy and we were a group of 7. Upon arriving 30min early we had to wait 45 min past our scheduled time to get called. Once we were finally seated it took almost an hour before they actually took our order. This would have been the last straw but when you are with a group time does pass a little quicker. When we finally got our food the wait staff was no where to be found for most of the time we were there. 

For these reasons I would be hesitant to return unless it was already decided upon by others."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in AZ. Nice atmosphere and all the ingredients always taste fresh. Only downside is that this place gets way too crowded."}
{"text":"Could not agree more with the reviewer who called the food bland. Best description I can come up with as well. Taco Bell or Del Taco have more flavor. Whether salsa or an entree it seems the cooks don't have any spices in the kitchen. Shame. Great ambience but even the drinks are weak and watery.  Wonder if Chef Ramsey is interested in visiting Mesa..."}
{"text":"The building is cool, the food value is pretty good, but food flavor has diminished a lot.  The salsas were sweet (why sweet?), and the meats were bland.  Bummer.  Better Mexican food is pretty commonly available."}
{"text":"The East Valley does not have a lot of great restaurants, at least I haven't found them.  For a regular place to go where the food and service is dependably good, my husband and I choose Rancho De Tia Rosa on Higley in Gilbert.  We also like the original location but this one is closer to home.  My favorite food to order is the shrimp tacos, and salads, which are surprisingly tasty.  My husband loves the mole and blue margaritas.  We've taken a lot of friends here and they all seem to have a good time.  Nothing fancy, just good."}
{"text":"This locally owned restaurant is awesome, but the well known McKellips Road location in Mesa is closed due to a fire and lease problems from what I have learned. A totally different restaurant now operates at the McKellips location under a \"similar name\". Do NOT be fooled, it is not the same restaurant. HOWEVER Rancho de Tia Rosa's has another location at Higley and Guadalupe in Gilbert. The same food, same owners, awesome awesome awesome....... AND a new Taqueria is being opened at Greenfield and Brown. Renovation is under way. I drive by it every day. So a new location to open soon!! YAY!!!! The Sirrine family's Mexican food is not your typical mexican food. The recipes are awesome. You simply must experience it for yourself. We have never had a dish there that we did not like. We have eaten there at least once a month since they opened their McKellips location and used to eat at the FIRST restaurant from time to time too. So this review is not based on just one visit. We are hooked!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible!! Our waiter did not check on us after our food came out. I ordered chiliquiles and they are more like nachos. I had to eat them with my hands. I definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Salsa is good. Food is hit or miss, but sadly all the reviews about the service and the long waits and the nazi rule about not seating your party are all true. It looks nice, but the experience leaves such a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of salsa can cover it up."}
{"text":"I'm no expert at Mexican food, but I always enjoy myself when I come here. Their margarita's are delicious as well as their enchiladas (and of course the standard chips/salsa). Staff is friendly, prices good. Not sure what else you can want from a restaurant. I plan to continue to come here and try out more items from their menu."}
{"text":"Went in tonight after picking out pumpkins. Did a quick yelp search, and this is what showed up within 2 miles. Fam Bam all agreed to give it a try. When we got there, there was a large Homecoming crowd pretty much blocking the inside to the restaurant. Am employee approached me and asked if I had checked in yet. I replied \"no\" haven't been able to get around this large crowd. He immediately brought us to the hostess station, where we were seated almost immediately. 

Chips and salsa were delivered almost immediately. The red salsa was ok/good but the green had an unpleasant sweet taste, unexpected in a green salsa. I ordered the bean dip. OMG!!! It was HUGE!!! enough to feed a table of 10 at least. No big deal, it was only $3. But it tasted funny!!! I was the ONLY one who ate any of it. 

Then our orders came. My youngest has what she always does at a Mexican restaurant, cheese quesadilla. Totally fine. My oldest ordered chicken tacos and asked ( for chicken, cheese and lettuce only). They came out with pico all over them. Hubs got Carne Asada, which appeared to be a beef roast (cooked in a crockpot, if you will).  Last i knew Carne Asada was GRILLED flank steak, or a similar cut!!! FAIL!!! I got a steak burrito, which had the same meat. I asked for \" smothered\" and the red sauce tasted aluminum.  Plus the tortillas were not fresh or made there. You could see the kitchen from where we were sitting and there were stacks of pre packaged/ pre made tortillas. What a disappointment. Plus $80 later, We will not be back!!! It's too bad because all and all, the service was great!!! They need to work on their kitchen. This is AZ!!! You should not pay $80 for Mexican food and walk away pissed!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry I just don't get it. This place is huge and always packed. My in-laws always want to go, so I've been there a bunch. I feel excited to go inside when I get there because it has a cool atmosphere of this semi-old world, pueblo restaurant. Other than that, I think it's barely decent Mexican food and cocktails."}
{"text":"Decent food. I feel like the Mesa location tastes fresher? Or maybe I just came in unsure because it's under new ownership. Overall it's a staple from growing up in Mesa and now that we are living in Gilbert this Higley location is closer. We'll be back:)"}
{"text":"Don't buy a gift card. The new management wont accept gift cards purchased during the old management. This needed to be handled better."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD, YUM. 

We were seated and immediately greeted with fresh in-house chips and salsa. The chips were amazing, fresh, hot and lightly salted.

Once our food was ordered it was out within about 15-20 minutes - and we went on a busy night. These guys HUSTLE. Every 10 minutes they would fill our drinks, ask us how our evening was going. Very impressive service. 

YOU MUST TRY THEIR MARGARITAS! I ordered a Strawberry Margarita and was in love."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat some authentic Mexican Food, Looked up  this restaurant and read reviews.  Very dissapointed is to put it mildly.  I'm from Hawaii where we have no good Mexican food and thought anything is better than Mexican food in Hawaii, wrong!  I should have known when I saw no hispanics in the restaurant at all.  Everything was horrible from the sweet salsa's tasted like it came right out of a jar.  All three of the salsa's had sugar in it to the aweful crab enchilada, my husband had the carne asada and that was aweful.  They stew the meat rather than grill.  If you are into more american style Mexican than maybe this will work for you.  If you appreciate real Authentic, dont waste your time.

The only good thing was the restaurant had great service and cute decor.  Kudos to the staff!  All very nice.  Just the food was not good at all."}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about service! Our nephew left his retainer on the table, it wasn't long before the server and the owner himself were looking around everywhere for these retainers.  Nephew (and nephews mom) even had to look through the thrown out food and they were found! Haha funny story I thought I'd share. Everyone was so nice about it!"}
{"text":"The service here was amazing.  The food was just as good.  We were visiting family and we love coming here with them each year. I ordered a taco, thinking it would be a regular taco from a sit-down restaurant- kind of soft, without fresh veggies.  This taco had two layers of tortillas on the tacos and the veggies were the freshest I'd ever tasted.  Our meals came with rice and the rice was a bit cold.  I told our waiter it was a little cold and only two minutes later he came back out with a new bowl of rice.  If you are coming out near Mesa, I highly recommend this stop to you."}
{"text":"This is within walking distance of our house so we were excited when they moved into the neighborhood. The last 2 times we were here we received horrible service in fact NO service at all once we were seated. After waiting 10+ minutes we walked out. The first time we were seated on the patio. The last time we arrived and decided to eat in the bar and watch the football game. When we arrived half of the bar was full and the other half of the tables had not been cleaned. The young male bartender was busy flirting with a table full of girls. We waited and waited for the dirty tables to get bussed. I finally walked up to the hostess stand and spoke the the manager. He said that he would have someone clean the tables. The tables were finally cleared so we were seated. Again the bar was only half full. We waited for 10+ mins for the young bartender to come and take our drink order only to be ignored. We got up and decided to leave. I stopped by the hostess stand where the manager was camped out. I told him that since we were seated not 1 person stopped by to deliver water or to take a drink or food order. He apologized and said that he would have someone right over. At this point the damage was done. I told him that we were trying to patronize his establishment but the lack of service not once but twice was the breaking point. Needless to say we will not return nor recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I went one Saturday for lunch and were SOOOO disappointed in the service that the would have to be superb for us to ever considering going back, but unfortunately it wasn't. 

The salmon I got was pretty decent and the chicken mole enchiladas my hubby ordered were pretty decent, too. But the young server (he looked no older than 14) never should be on the front line of customer service. He seemed to never have heard of lemon with iced tea before, as the 3 times I asked for it I received a blank stare and finally on the 3rd time got my lemon.When he delivered our meals, he quickly disappeared without napkins or silverware. So we flagged down another waiter asking for napkins and silverware, his response, \"I'll go get your server.\" So by the time he reappeared our food was cold.

The place seemed disorganized and like they had no system in place. even though I could literally walk there from my house, I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Had their lunch menu.  Both the wife and I had the burritos.  She had chicken, I had pork.  Pork was seasoned great.  The wife found the chicken not seasoned at all.  Too bland.  Rice and beans are very good!  Nice selection of flavorful Margaritas!"}
{"text":"Nice large family style restaurant with decent service & broad menu.

We visited this spot on a weeknight date night.  We had visited a farmers market nearby and heard this spot was good.

Strip mall spot super duper decorated for the holidays in that fun fiesta grandma style.  We opted for the patio which is big but only an alley view.

We tried the margaritas- of course from mix how disappointing in Arizona!  Just juice a lime people!!!

My hunny had the seafood enchiladas and liked it very much but did not appeal to me.  I had the carne asada plate which was of a crock pot shredded beef instead of grilled steak which I was expecting.  Not a big fan of this- the grilled peppers and onions was the only thing I ate.

My hunny got the homemade ice cream which was had ice crystals and the raspberry topping was the highlight of the night!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious... I specially love their tamales, they taste like some one picked up the corn that morning!!! True, the place is ALWAYS busy but that is understandable since they have good food, good service and nice atmosphere. Plus, even thought is always busy, we never had to wait more than 5 minutes before we get a table. Last time my boyfriend and I were there, we were sitting right next to a table with 15 people. We thought \"great, now our waiter is going to be to busy and we'll get bad service\"... but no, that didn't happen... we got great service. Also, even though it gets pretty busy, we never felt is too loud or crowded. We are always comfortable and can have a conversation without having to yell across the table. 
Plus, they also have tons of outdoor seating.  Anyway, We love this place so much that we drive 30 minutes just to eat there... and 30 minutes is a long drive for those of us who like to hang out within the Tempe city limits!!!!!"}
{"text":"Actual conversation:
Waitress: \"And for you, what will you have?\"
My daughter: \"The nachos.\"
Waitress: \"What kind of meat?\"
Me (I'm the mom): \"No, she just wants the nachos off the appetizer section.\"
Waitress: \"It comes with it.  Beef, chicken, carne.\" 
daughter gives a happy look because it didn't say that on the menu
Daughter: \"I'll have the chicken please\"

Menu price $7.99
Billed $10.99 because it does not, in fact, \"come with it.\"  

So, aside from that round of utter bullsh*t, we already were not pleased with this place. 

It was crowded. The tables were all kind of close together.  Not uncommon, and probably wouldn't ordinarily make me take away stars - but this is a Mormon establishment and when you have a table a foot away from you with children of any age you have to be extra careful what you say... and you want to be relaxed at dinner and not feel like you're going to hell because you said a random curse word, godda*n it!  (See what I mean?  If you're reading this and you are LDS you already feel uncomfortable...)

Onto the food.  Oh my gosh!  How are there so many good reviews on this places food? Do the Mormons really think this is good or are they supporting this place because it is Mormon owned??  Please, by all means, judge for yourself... but it's neither authentic nor run-of-the-mill.  It's just not good.  I also ordered nachos, vegetarian style, and they tasted smokey.  I don't want smoke in my nachos!  Who wants smoke in their traditional nachos?  Every person in my group reported their meal was ever so slightly smokey.  The salsas were weird, and not in a good way.  I cannot put my finger on it.     

Clearly, not going back.  Especially after blatant nacho fraud."}
{"text":"I love both this location and the one on McKellips.  Tacos, flying saucer, and enchilladas are all good.  And the decor is charming.  This is one of my \"go-to\" places for out of town guests."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible!! Worse service I have ever had at any place!! We waited over 2 hours before our server even came to our table AFTER we had to talk to the manager! My son started getting cranky, not enjoyable at all!!"}
{"text":"We always seem to try this restaurant during our stays in Mesa.  We usually get either the Flying Saucer, Beef Carne Plater Tortilla, or the Chicken Chimichanga for a meal and have never been unsatisfied with what is served to us.  My wife likes it because they can make the food at a consistent spice level where it is not too \"bland\" or too hot for someone to eat.  I have read previous reviews and about the food being too \"sweat\" and am fortunate to say that has not been our experience."}
{"text":"A little history on this place.
If I remember right, the owner of Tia Rosa's was the original owner of Rosa's Mexican grill on Univ & Mesa Dr. He sold that (still exists there.. don't know if it tastes the same) to make a more \"elegant\"? mexican food experience. 
I think something was lost in the translation between the move because I don't care so much for the Tia Rosa's as much as the old school Rosa's.
The good thing is that he also made a small shop with an identical menu to the old school joint on Univ & Mesa so that I can get my favs there. 
So I'm not so much a fan of the fancy joint as I am the old style menu which sits in the same parking lot.
I love their Hot salsa. My wife loves their Green salsa."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour. Had excellent appetizers from the happy hour menu. The nachos were the best nachos I have ever had with a nice smoky flavor!  THE best server, Andrew,  took care of our large party like a champ!  Excellent experience!  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"First thing was the salsa and chips, this is the first thing that should have been a hint to leave. Yuck, ordered tortilla soup, how can you get that wrong? It was tomato based? had peas in it? Truly disappointed. Tried the pork burrito too, pork was burned and had a bad flavor, the verde sauce was sweet? and I swear the refried beans were made with liquid smoke. 
Sorry but we will not be visiting your establishment again, sorry we drove 10 miles to try it."}
{"text":"Chips came out, 1/2 the basket was soggy tortilla (not even crispy). Both salsas taste like they're from a can, the green one tastes like sugar water. Kids \"quesadilla\" is just cheese melted on top of a tortilla.

Maybe they were having an off day. Locals seem to like it because it was packed. I hate posting bad reviews but hoping they see this and step up the quality. I've never been served a basket of soggy chips, ever.

My note to the owner, make your salsa fresh. It would make a world of difference. If you already do, try a different recipe, it's as bad as a store bought can."}
{"text":"I'm an Arizona native and had never heard of Tia Rosa before I moved to Mesa.  Now that I have been to Tia Rose I find it difficult to gear up for any sit-down Mexican that isn't Tia Rosa.  I've traveled the West Coast, East Coast, Mexico, Europe, and Spain (I've also had lunch in Morocco once) and Tia Rose is quite possibly the most beautiful restaurant I have ever dinned in.  Tia Rose is tied with Damiana in San Jose del Cabo.  I love sitting in the back patio underneath the large tree.  The salsa verde is utterly fantastic and the grilled mixed vegetables side is a can't miss as well.  My wife loves the sweet corn tamale."}
{"text":"For some reason (it was our choice) we sat outside in the middle of June in the early evening.  But I cannot hold the Southwest temperature against the restaurant.  We arrived with a large group and no reservation, and we were easily accommodated on the patio.  My friend and I split a avocado/pineapple salad (those are the ingredients, not the name) and a glazed chicken dish.  Neither were particularly \"Mexican\" but it was quite good.  Most of the group ordered margaritas, and even the picky margarita drinkers were happy.  

To sum up, I would go back!"}
{"text":"This place is closed due to a fire. They should post that and when they plan on reopen ing"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Happy hour prices are amazing. It's hard to decide what to order because everything is so delicious and fresh. The service here is outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is my second review of this place. And it's not the food. The food is pretty good. This is the second time (I came in on Saturday evening Feb 10th)  I have witnessed \"SIERRA\" being rude to fellow employees. Yelling at them in the middle of the restaurant. This is beyond ridiculous, unprofessional. It seems like you as an establishment don't care that this goes on. But I will write about it regardless. I guess this way is ok for you all. One star? Had to. Wouldn't let me do no stars. She's awful. And this is my personal experience we are all entitled to write what we experienced at any establishment. Again the food is awesome and my server this evening was great. I won't have her be my server ever again. Once with her was enough."}
{"text":"Will not be returning to this restaurant. Our server was rude on top of not getting water out to us until after our food was finished. Service wasn't great, all of the food had a smoky flavor and the drinks were \"dive bar drink.\" Save your money for a better establishment."}
{"text":"If you are 65 or older this place is for you! You get 10% off with your AARP card... apparently. Food is bland and SWEET. If you are looking for spicy, flavorful Mexican food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"We loved this place when it was at it's McKellips location...the atmosphere was unique and a great place to take out of town guests. They had an awesome patio and a private backyard area for private parties...in fact, this is where my husband and I got married! 

We wish they didn't move so far away, but we do go their on special occasions. Even though they did a good job replicating their McKellips location, it just isn't the same since it is in a strip mall versus the private setting it had on McKellips. the green salsa is to die for and worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to this restaurant due to all the hubbub about the other locations.  So many people seemed so happy about this new location opening here in Chandler.  I work in the area so I thought, \"what the hell, why not!\" 

I called ahead and put my name down for a reservation.  Haha, probably didn't need to do so.  It was empty when we arrived at 5:30.  Though early, still disheartening to see an empty restaurant.  We showed up 15 minutes early and got seated right away, sweet.

Our waiter was right there when we got seated and had water in tow.  Already a plus.  First thing I asked was his recommendation.  He had 4 or 5 recommendations for 2 or 3 different scenarios (light meals, heavy meals, chicken/beef etc.\"  

Salsa and chips were \"eh had better\"  The green salsa was yummy and different because it was sweet, but the red salsa was your average run of the mill tomato salsa.

I ordered the \"Nuevo Chile Relleno,\" and it was phenomenal.  Prepared beautifully, extremely tasty, and an average sized portion which was plenty large enough.  ($14)

My girlfriend had the beef \"Flying Saucer.\" ($8) It was served on top of a crispy, muy delicioso fried tortilla thing and was stacked as tall as it was wide with yummy goodness.  The beef was shredded and seasoned to perfection.  

Ok the most depressing part of this meal... you knew it was coming... the Spanish rice.  It was surprising when it came out to my table because I had no clue it came with my food.  Totally failed reading comprehension apparently.  It was bland and tasteless.  Much much colder than the rest of our meal and honestly if they left it out, my meal would probably have been better.  whoops.

All together a great experience.  And I will return to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Tia's is reliably good. Not super authentic  but I have yet to have a disappointing experience. I like to bring out of town guests here. 

Chips and salsa and water are always on the table almost immediately. I will say, if I could improve one thing with Tia's it would be the salsa. It's just not that good. There is a red and a green, neither are spicy. The green is actually rather sweet. It is served in strangely small containers and I usually don't eat very much of it even though I love chips and salsa. It's just bland.

The entrees however, are really good. I recommend the chimichanga, but on occasion I have ordered the nachos (off of the appetizer menu) as an entree. The margaritas are excellent as well.

Service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I just came back from a trip to Mexico. So if you can believe it ,I was craving Mexican food. One of the best places I have been for Mexican is Rancho DE Tia ROSA.
Well, we got there early to beat the rush. But, sadly enough they were closed.
They had a horrible Kitchen fire and will be closed for at least 6 months.
Thank you Jesus no one was hurt. But, it has put them out of Business at least at this location.
The Tacareia is still open. That is basically just Tacos and to go orders.
It was already packed. So I was a bit ifffy If I wanted to go or not.
Then the girl giving all the info said we could go to the one in Gilbert.
She even gave us a coupon for a cheese crisp. So we went.
I love the whole ambiance at this location. I hope that they get it all back together soon. When they are up and running again. It is a great place to visit."}
{"text":"I've been here over 20 times mainly because it's in walking distance. It is decent food and fast service but I struggle to say any one dish is great. But if your looking for some what cheap fast family friendly Mexican style food then go for it just don't get a craving for it on Sunday's they are closed!"}
{"text":"BEST salmon and shrimp tacos!!!! I'm from Alaska where we know salmon and these rocked my socks."}
{"text":"My experience at Tia Rosa was awesome! We had a large party that I reserved a room for and our waitress Blanca was very on top of it! She got all of our orders correct, even special requests to change menu entrees! The restaurant manager was very accommodating to our large crowd and gave us the best service. A+ for the service and A+ for the food! Everything tasted great! The mango salsa was incredible! The pork enchiladas with butternut squash sauce was incredible! Every person at our table was happy and satisfied! They were even able to keep the glasses full! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is always good and I've never gotten anything I didn't like. My favorite is their chicken mole enchiladas! We eat their often and would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone who says Best Mexican food in the East Valley.

Every time I have people from out of town I bring them here.

Incredible Margaritas.

Get the Carne Asada plate...  Not what you're used to, but you won't be dissapointed.

They used to have this Chocolate Decadence dessert, which was two different pieces of some crazy chocolate cakes.  They took it off the menu... :("}
{"text":"We got here and waited 20 min to get our drinks after ordering,my husband had to get up and go to the bar to get them after that we waited 45 min for our waitress to come over and take our order she forgot about us!!! We ended up leaving and not staying to eat. They needed more waitresses or more motivated ones!"}
{"text":"Bottom line - Happy hour is the secret.  Get the Nanchos with pork (enough for 4!!) And order a cerveza Rita.  This place can NOT, I repeat can NOT do busy.  Terrible service when busy from hostess to servers there is a failure to communicate process and timing.  Also, WTH is up with the sweet salsa???!  Both green, red, and even the hot has sweetness!  Please please remove the sugar from your recipe!  All of your salsas would be great with NO sugar!  Did I say that they can NOT do busy?  Prepare to wait over an hour for your food outside of happy hour.  Ok, editing this review again....90 minutes later...still no food...ugghhh.  I want to love this place....I really do."}
{"text":"Love the good and great service. I was even able to watch a game while I was there.  We went for a family birthday and we were given a room for just our family to use."}
{"text":"Not much by CA standards. Asked for a very common dish and they don't even make it, yikes!!"}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing night here at this location. The waiter was unfriendly, never smiled and acted like he was mad all night. Beverages were not refilled for some of our party and I was never even asked if I wanted another margarita. Oh, and the margarita was watered down and I could not even taste the premium tequila that I ordered. the only thing that was good was the food. Yummy as always so at least the kitchen staff rocks. We will never return to this location again as our experience each time has gone downhill."}
{"text":"We went to Tia Rosa's because my dad was in town and it's close to my sister's apartment. The patio looked inviting, but the whole experience was lack luster. We were seated on the back patio which was really pleasant, but this meant we were one of our servers few tables outside. Because of this, we rarely saw our server. The other tables outside were annoyed too. The table next to us actually got up to go find her so they could leave.

 I asked her if there was a signature margarita....she didn't really have an answer. My dad asked about the sangria and her response was, \"I've never had it.\" She was nice but didn't sparkle.

The chips and salsa were blah. The guacamole was pre made or from the grocery store...definitely not fresh. The red salsa tasted like the kind in the jar.

I'm surprised to read that people didn't like the meat- that was the only part we did like! It was flavorful and tender. 

The manager brought out our food and our server hadn't cleared our appetizer plates. He began to clear the table and he grabbed my tortilla for my fajitas. Like his whole thumb went into my tortilla....and he did the same thing to my dad's tortillas. Gross. He thought it was funny. He also couldn't figure out how to turn on the heater and tried like 4 of them to the point of being awkward.

Basically, there are better Mexican restaurants in the valley. Skip this one."}
{"text":"I love to give great reviews. They are usually the only ones I give. But our experience here....right now, has been horrible. First of all, we were told the wait was 25 minutes....after 45 we asked how long it would be and noticed our name was crossed off....they had given our table to someone else. When they realized their mistake, they sat us immediately. We then waited over 15 minutes for someone to come to our table and that was only because we had stopped them two separate times. Then Steven stopped to help us out. He was not suppose to have our table, but he had noticed we had been sitting for awhile. He took our order right away and was nothing but amazing. The food was great as well. He apologized multiple times for the wait, even though it was not his fault. So, if you ever do go to Tia Rosas in gilbert, ask for Steven. Without him, this review would have been a 1. If we decide to come back....he is the reason."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend and daughter and the food was amazing! Cierra R was our waitress and she made sure we were well taken care of. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"We love Tia Rosa's! Used to visit the Mckellips location often before it closed. The ambiance and decor is very authentic and unique. The service is always very quick and friendly! The food is delicious and well priced. Go for lunch for dishes well under $10. They offer a large patio area which is BEAUTIFUL. I ordered the chimichanga, and most dishes are served with rice and beans (my favorite part!) Will of course, be back!"}
{"text":"First time and definitely loved it, food was awesome nobody complained about the meals they ordered,we sat on the patio and it was relaxing and quiet our server (Lety) was super awesome got our drinks and food out in a timely manner, definitely bringing the family again thanks Lety for your awesome service on a weeknight."}
{"text":"When the honey and I found out that Rancho De Tia Rosa had opened up a location a few blocks from our house we were so excited. We have been to the other location many many times and loved the food. 
On our first visit, the wait was over an hour but the food was delicious and you can't go wrong with getting a pitcher of their House Margarita. The service has always been a little slow at the other location and not much has changed in that regard.
We went for lunch the second time and I was less than impressed. I wasn't very hungry so opted to just get the Tortilla soup. The server was not very attentive and when he brought out my soup it was cold. It took some time to actually find him to get it taken care of and even then he asked me if I just wanted them to reheat it?!!! Uhh excuse me? Wow, why not fix the mistake by getting me a whole new bowl and actually cook it correctly?!  The other thing that rubbed me the wrong way was that I had asked for some cheese to put on top of the soup- they had the nerve after all of that to charge me a $1 for that! Now I realize it is just a dollar but really? After they screwed up, we had crappy service and by the time it was fixed my honey was done eating so I only had time to eat half of the soup anyhow. 
The reality for us is that we live in an area that has not many choices when it comes to mexican food so we will probably go back again. I will not however, be going back for seconds on the Tortilla soup."}
{"text":"We went here with a large group and had a really good time. There was a little mix up with the checks when we were all trying to leave but honestly, several separate checks can get crazy so we understood. The food was good. I mentioned that I had a dairy allergy but I forgot to say \"no cheese\" and our server obviously didn't put it down that I couldn't have cheese but it was an honest mistake. Love how it's decorated. I had the salmon tacos. They come with a mango salsa that all goes SO WELL together. I definitely will go back. If you go in a big group, make sure to note that they'll charge an 18% gratuity automatically. This is to be expected but there were several people in our group that didn't notice and tipped on top of the already added cost."}
{"text":"I really don't know why everyone has been raving about this place. This restaurant is mediocre at best. My husband and I have been here two or three times and we left super disappointed every time. The margharitas were incredibly watered down all the times we visited, the salsa is meh, and all the entrees we tried were mediocre. This place is ok, but nothing special or memorable."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is inexpensive and pretty good.  Nachos get soggy but the time you get to the bottom but they come out piled high. Rolled tacos are great as is the burrito especially when it's fried."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on this newly opened restaurant, I wasn't setting my expectations too high.

My husband and I and two friends went tonight and had a great time.  The staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  The waiter made sure that we had what we needed and didn't stop by too little or too much.

The chips and salsa were great, one red salsa and one green.  Not hot at all.

I had the appetizer of two tamales and a side of black beans and it was just the rights size for my smaller appetite and a large size for an appetizer.

My husband got the pork burrito with red sauce.  He was pleased with the size and actually took half of his home.  He said the burrito wasn't too spicy for his tastes.  He also enjoyed the rice and beans.

It seems like they have their act together.

The parking lot was full and fortunately the restaurant shares the lot with a large strip mall of sorts and so there was plenty of parking in the back of the restaurant.  We really liked the decor and ambiance.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Newly opened Mexican restaurant tucked away in the Dobson and Germann area.  I would give the place 5 stars for decor, the owner has taken such great effort to make the restaurant look like old Mexico on the inside.

The food was good but not great.  I did relish on the tomatillo salsa brought with the red salsa and chips.  The portions were pretty big, no room for dessert and had to request togo boxes.

Ordered:
Seafood Tacos (great with excellent presentation)
Tia's Plato de Carne Asada: Tres Carnes - beef, pork and chicken (huge)
Tia Rosa Burro (huge)

I will definitely return and review, but overall I did like this place."}
{"text":"We went here last night for the first time. They had a 20-25 minute wait (ended up being 35), which wasnt too bad as we were there right at dinner time.

The first thing we tried was the salsa. The worst salsa I have ever had. It tasted like a marinara sauce. The green salsa was also very sweet and not good. We didn't know until we were leaving that they had several different kinds of salsa, so maybe the other ones are better. We also had the queso, which was amazing. The right combination of heat and cheese.

Our waitress was very busy, so that could contribute to the poor service. We were not offered refills, we had to flag her down for more drinks. Our food came out incorrect and we had to wait for several minutes to flag someone down to get it corrected.

I wanted three tacos on flour tortillas. The appetizer menu had three corn tortilla tacos. They would not let me substitute flour for corn because \"they are different sizes\" (which they are not). So next i asked if i could have the two flour tacos on the dinner menu, but have salad instead of rice and beans. They will not let you substitute because they \"only make large salads\". After going back and forth several times i finally asked about an ala carte menu. The waitress said yes but that it was more expensive to go that route. It is actually cheaper because i could order 3 tacos with no rice beans for the price of two tacos with rice and beans.

Overall impression: The food other than the salsa was pretty good. We will not go back because of the inflexibility of substitutions or even the lack of giving options. The service was absolutely horrible and a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good. I came here with my boyfriend on a Thursday night and there was no wait. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the patio seating is relaxing. The staff was all extremely helpful and friendly. 

Being Mexican American I have an idea of what Mexican food should taste like. I ordered the pork enchilada with red sauce. First, they served us chips and salsa. Nothing was hot or spicy. Very very mild and not very flavorful. I asked for hotter salsa and received a slightly less boring taste with the new batch. Not impressed. 

Our food soon arrived and I was starving! The red sauce on my enchilada was another big miss. It was so boring and plain. No favors what so ever. Wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. Hope they take another look at their menu and try to make it more traditional to Mexican flavoring."}
{"text":"This location has become our go to location for Mexican Food. 

They menu selection is not a typical selection. So if you are look for a combo plate with burrito, taco, etc. you may not quite find the menu you are looking for.

We have been three times, I have tried three different selections and been very happy with the food. 

My only complaint is that there salsa with the chips is less than what I prefer in flavor and spice.

Will return when we are in mood for Mexican Food."}
{"text":"We drove 45 minutes from Fountain Hills to eat there because they were supposed to have good food. The food was mediocre and the service was so bad we couldn't bring ourselves to leaving a tip ( I am usually a 20% we) Our server was inattentive but was likely the result of the poor systems management have in place. 

One our meals didn't arrive after the other 5 of us had been served 40minutes after placing our order. They told us they ran out. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for ten and were told to wait for twenty minutes on arrival. We were sat and then not attended to for fifteen minutes. We placed our order and three were forgotten to be placed. We were headed to a play so could not wait longer for another order to be placed. No manager came to apologize and nothing was comped. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed this Restarant but it is not what it used to be.

Last night we called ahead and they put our name on the wait list.  We checked in when we arrived and was told \"just wait\".  Well I waited 30 minutes and checked back... they told me they didn't have me on the list!    We waited another 15 and finally got seated in the bar.

Chips arrived right away but the margarita took another 15 minutes.    The server took our order but it was apparent he was more interested in the table of 10 nearby... bigger tip potential.

We had to ask for water twice, remind him of our drink order and begged for more chips!   Very frustrating.   It wasn't just us, the table next to us asked for a take out box 3 times!   We compared notes and we both agreed that the service was horrible!

Oh... at 6:30 pm on a Saturday they were out of Mole sauce.... great planning for a Saturday night.

I'm sure they won't miss one customer, so we are done with this place."}
{"text":"Still Rockin like usual, but wanted to give new  update from my old review.

Went their last night and they have soda from the fountain now,, YEAH!"}
{"text":"I loved the original Rosa's in Mesa. I wrote off the new one on Mckellips 10 years ago swearing I would never return. I tried this new place with major reserve. I am delighted to say it is back to great food. 
The shredded beef is the bomb in anything they serve."}
{"text":"The best margaritas we've had in ages!  Would suggest this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant.  Their chicken mole is SO GOOD.  The papa con carne, chili relleno, and fish tacos are amazing as well.  NOTE:  The Taqueria's are not as good as this, the original restaurant.  The quality of the food is not even close.  I recently moved to another state, but whenever I come to town to visit family, they know that a trip to Tia Rosa will happen.  I have to get my chicken mole fix :)  And I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, and during the winter we always eat ourside, especially at Christmas when it's decorated.  Try this place atleast once.  Don't get the usual chimichanga or tacos, try one of their specialty dishes and you'll enjoy your visit so much more.  ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"we came here for happy hour. the building is super cute and cultured. took a while to get our order in because there was only one waiter on staff at the time and he was working the bar as well. the margarita was really tasty and strong. the salsa that came with the salsa and chips was too sweet for my liking. my beef tostada was excellent but the shrimp cocktail was pretty weak. i would come here again for sure though!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. They have some interesting dishes and an impressive margarita list! If you like spicy salsa ask for the \"hot\" salsa, it's very good. The service and food are consistently good. This is a favorite amongst our out of town guest as well. Tia's serves up great food and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was told that this was the best Mexican food in Mesa. If that is true, that makes me really sad. The food was terrible. The salsa tasted like sweet tomato juice, my beans were burnt, and the guacamole is as if it's out if a bag even though we were told it was made fresh in house out of avocados. Everything was so bland and the waitress seemed like she was unhappy with serving our group."}
{"text":"Really good salsas but easily the greasiest  quesadilla I've ever had. Good ambiance and decor and fair prices, but the food is just fair as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! This is an absolute favorite of mine. They have great salmon tacos, green corn tamales and nachos. My family has been going here for 12 years."}
{"text":"Fabulous facility! Whatever I've gotten here it is delicious! Everyone from the area has traditions of coming here for good reason!"}
{"text":"Horrible attitude by bartender. We have always had great service and food here. Brought friends to show them how cool this place is. They won't be back and we probably won't either. If you work in hospitality field it would be a good idea to be hospitable. Manager fixed the issue, but bartender continued her snotty attitude."}
{"text":"Rancho De Tia Rosa is a beautiful restaurant located in our 'hood' in Mesa and we have patronized it for all the years of it's existence  mostly because of it's close proximity more than anything.  Today 3 of us met for lunch, slightly past the the normal lunch hour, arriving at 12:45pm.  The dining room was full to capacity, the outside patio seating was full to capacity and we waited about 10 minutes for a nice table, were seating, waited on promptly by a charming and attentive waitress.  Our drinks and food came promptly, given the amount of people in the restaurant. 
Suddenly there seemed to be a great deal of commotion behind us, followed by loud, very terse conversation, in Spanish, followed by some crashes and thumps.  Seems that the OWNER had a crew of Mexican men IN THE CROWDED DINING ROOM ripping out booths and replacing them with new ones!  Apparently THE OWNER was not happy about something and yelled, screamed, and cursed (I understand just enough Spanish to know that when I hear it) and more or less humiliated the men, not to mention disrupting the entire dining room and this went on for at least 20 or 30 minutes!
The OWNER was demeaning, rude, disruptive and quite frankly a complete jerk.  We had taken a guest there to dine with us, which was a complete embarrassment to us and we all 3 vowed that we'd NEVER go into this restaurant ever again.....or recommend it to anyone else.  
Overall it was a very disappointing experience and quite frankly we couldn't tell you how the food tasted because we just needed to get through the meal and try to have as nice a visit as we could despite the clamoring and yelling.

{"text":"My wife and I had a very good meal at Rancho De Tia Rosa.I had the chicken fajitas which are a little different then your traditional fajitas.They do not come on a sizzling plate.The vegetables are grilled into large cubes with a nice char.The chicken was flavored nicely with a paprika tone.It also has re fried beans with Spanish rice .My wife is a vegetarian so there are not as many dishes to choose from.She had some spinach enchiladas with black beans and a corn salsa. It was very taste to her.We went on a Friday night about 5:30 pm and waited about 20 mins.This place has indoor and plenty of outdoor seating.Be prepared to wait. It will be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Probably our favorite Mexican food restaurant in the SE Valley. The salsas are both fantastic. The shrimp tacos are great! Our problem is when we find something we really like (like the shrimp tacos) we seldom try the other items on the menu when we return. Some places we keep returning to. This is one of them. Some we never go back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to get a pork green chili burro and beef taco for lunch. I ordered through Grub Hub, so it was pricey. I don't know if they just have a different style of \"Mexican Food\" than what I am used to, or what, but there was not a drop of green chili in with the pork in the burro. It was so dry I couldn't eat it. Definitely, not my opinion of authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great fresh mex! Love the salmon tacos with a mango salsa. I don't think you can go wrong with anything from Tia Rosas!

This is a well established restaurant in the valley and has been loved by the locals for years. Always fresh and good."}
{"text":"We have tried this place twice (with open minds) and both times we were disappointed!  The food was borderline terrible. I had the chicken mole enchiladas and asked for the sauce on the side. They refused because it would take away from the presentation....really!?!

As a result, as I expected, there was WAY to much sauce on my plate.  I was able to get down half of the 2 enchiladas but was to overwhelmed to finish the rest.

Had they allowed me to get the sauce on the side I'm sure my view would have been a little different.

Point-  Rancho you are not a 5 star restaurant.  I would recommend getting back to the basics when it comes to customer service because, at the end of the day, it is about the food."}
{"text":"!st and last time here.  It is overpriced and not very good.  The chips were greasy and not was not very good.  We like Abuelos mexican food in chandler better!"}
{"text":"This our go to spot! The service is so friendly and attentive. The food is awesome, great flavor, large portions which is great for leftovers, favorable margarita selection, and excellent atmosphere. Whether, it's just the hubby and I, or we bring the kids, everyone has an option and leaves happy. We've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a table, which is surprising since it seems they are always busy when we go in. And I love that they take Sunday's off to give their outstanding team time with their families."}
{"text":"Really gross. The wait staff was awkward & kind of rude. The drinks were okay. I just knew I could have made myself a better dinner at home."}
{"text":"Overall it was good food. Location is great and friendly people. Salsa is wayyy to sweet. Chips tasted like bagged chips. The food is good tho I liked the rice a lot."}
{"text":".Great service and atmosphere but the food was just okay.  All of our meat had a smoky taste but otherwise not a lot of flavor.  We were disappointed because we really wanted to like the place."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. I used to love their beans but they are just bland now and taste watered down. Everything is bland in fact. The tamales have no taste and the red sauce is like bad marinara. Wish they could go back to how they used to be. Won't be coming again."}
{"text":"What else should some new england guys do when they're visiting family this close to mexico? Margaritas and tacos!

First off...don't be confused by the location. This business is one of the few that is not closed in this strip mall.  (I'm confused as to how the snow board rental shop didn't make it in AZ?)  The upside of this is plenty of available parking!  The decor is classic \"Mexican restaurant in America\", which I actually think is fun.

The service was decent, although for how slow the place was I think they could've been a little more attentive.  The staff is mainly high school/college age kids..who look like they're trying at least.  The waiter even ran after us as we were leaving to give my cousin her reading glasses ($1.99@walgreens) that she left on the table...not by any means because she had a couple margaritas.

Food was decent...I would definitely come back again for a casual bite.  We arrived at 4pm, which was awesome because the bar was having happy hour.  We each got a different margarita on the list.  I decided on the Don Quixote because I enjoy an aged tequila.  All of us decided that the marg's were quite tasty.  We ordered the sampler platter and a bunch of the $1 Tijuana tacos and must admit that they were very good.  I'll commonly do 'taco tuesdays' at a local bar in boston and their $2 taco's don't stand a chance next to these.  The sampler platter was okay, but I wouldn't order it again.

Our stomachs full of awesome tacos and margs...the only thing left to do while visiting family in phoenix is to stretch out under the sun and take a little siesta!"}
{"text":"Outstanding place. Best Mexican I've had since i moved to PHX. I had the beef fajitas and my wife had the seafood enchiladas. Nice salsa and lots to pick from on the menu. Wife didn't love her margarita. Great, attentive staff."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch here with my wife. We sat inside. We were seated quickly. Waiter was very nice. Atmosphere is nice too. Got cheese crisp appetizer and it was decent. BEWARE they do not have carne asada. They have shredded beef only! I got told they had carne but it was shredded. Bad idea, burrito was only average and meat had some large pieces which were not shredded. Wife got shredded beef tacos and was let down. I did think green salsa with chips was great. Service was actually great....attentive but not overbearing. Food left us desiring our favorite Mexican restaurant but was hoping this place would be great as it is closer to home. Try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I give this one star only because the queso fundido was the saving grace.  Got there around noon today, place wasn't busy at all.  Took forever for anyone to come to the table, then again to get drink order and drinks.  Had to send back my fountain drink because it tasted super funky.  We are salsa aficianados and had our own salsa company so we were quite disappointed with the awful sweet green salsa and what tasted like jarred red grocery store salsa with sugar added.  The food wasn't much better.  Everything arrived lukewarm.  It was such a disappointment.  I ate only one of my two enchiladas and couldn't bring myself to eat the other one.  The service was appalling.  I was never offered sugar or sweetener for my tea, we were never asked how the food was and were basically ignored the entire time other than when our server had to bring something to the table.  We tried this place because it always seems busy when we go next door to eat Chinese food.  Can't figure out why.  Our $50 lunch wasn't worth half that.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went here lastnight with family and really like the place.  Atmosphere is awesome and there is so much to look at!  That said the service was as expected, fast, and they clear the tables as you clear your plates!! WOW, what a novel idea!!  I thought that was very customer focused.  The food was delish!  I had the fish tacos, shrimp and salmon with the fruit salsas and OMG!!  I wanted more even though I was full!! The chips and salsa are even more addicting here, something about the crunch, and the salsas were not too spicy and actually a little sweet!  THE FLAN WAS FANTASTIC!!  I highly highly recommend for awesome Mexican food, perhaps the best Mexican food I have had in my 10 years living in AZ!!"}
{"text":"the food is good. great lunch spot. I get the salmon tacos there are by far my favorite."}
{"text":"The margaritas are very strong and good! 
Meat cooked perfectly on the salmon dish. 
Decor is fun to look at.
Way too loud, don't sit in the main room! 
Service was excellent. 
Great first experience."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!! The food is amazing ! It was super busy which was great! Very family friendly.
The decor was beautiful I felt like I was back in Acapulco Mexico!
The food was simply unbelievable I ate every single bite! Very tasty authentic Mexican food!
I will be eating here again very soon!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! I love there green salsa!! they are so great as a matter of fact that my wife and i had them cater our wedding reception. I recommend this to anyone in the mesa area. From the Tia burrito to the enchiladas you cant go wrong!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is good and so are the drinks. This place gets super busy so expect to wait a bit during dinner hours. (And not sitting a large party when not everybody is there is common for any busy restaurant.)

The food is a little over priced. $13 for a single chile relleno with a small side of beans is pushing it. Add some rice and/or another relleno like every other Mexican food place. 

They're Johnny on the spot with chips and salsa refills, though the salsa cups could be a little bigger.

Last time with a party of 4 my entree came out cold. Front house is well run, back house not so much. This place has the potential to be easy 4 stars by upping food quantity or reducing prices."}
{"text":"My parents like this place so we eat here fairly often.  The salsa is pretty good and the food is reasonable for americanized mexican.  Nothing is particularly spicy or flavorful and they may serve the worst fish tacos I've ever had.  If you stick to burros and fried ice cream you can have a nice family dinner here."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  I've been coming to Tia Rosa's since I was a kid and I am so spoiled by their quality of Mexican food that I can't even enjoy any other Mexican restaurant's food! There are so many great options but the best thing on the menu in my opinion is shrimp tacos. I'd definitely recommend the Chile Relleno as well. Different than your average Chile Relleno but seriously so delicious!! And not deep fried which I feel is a huge plus. The food generally isn't too spicy but they offer a spicier salsa if you ask for it :)"}
{"text":"This ranch style restaurant is beautiful with flowering plants and potted shrubs all around giving one the feeling that you are going over to a very wealthy friends oversized house for a festive occasion. Once inside the atmosphere is very much the same and quite pleasing. You could easily just walk about and look at all the cool decorations sprinkled throughout the restaurant or hanging on the walls. The back patio is where we chose to sit and was very cozy with the sound of a romantic water feature in the background. Nice.

Free chips and both red and green salsas were brought to the table as soon as we were seated. The chips were pleasantly fresh and tasty as well as the salsas. We shared an Adobo Shrimp Cocktail served in a fancy glass with a layer of cocktail sauce on top of a pleasant mixture of greens. I ordered the Seafood Tacos which came with a Shrimp Taco with a delicious Pineapple Salsa and a Grilled Salmon Taco with an Orange Mango Salsa. It also came with a side of your choice. My friend ordered a really large Chicken Salad with Mango and all sorts of other fresh goodies on top. It was so big she took half of it home for later.

Service was both friendly and prompt. If the weather permits choose the outdoor back patio vs the inside main section for the extra ambience or you can visit their smaller Taqueria restaurant next door when in a hurry or wish to get some great takeout. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has a really cool atmosphere.  The food is good but the margaritas are a little uninspired.  Be prepared if you're trying to go on a Saturday evening - the restaurant (and the parking lot) fill up quickly.  Although the food is average and the margaritas only passable, it is still a great place to go for the charming decor of the place and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times in the past and in general the food quality has been pretty good. This time I was really disappointed with the food and drinks. The place was crowded when we arrived Saturday afternoon and it has happy hour. The chips and salsa came and the chips were not fresh they were cold and hard.  So we decided to go ahead and order beer on tap and it was really watered down and not cold at all, so we asked our waiter to bring something else that taste like beer and was cold. Well, the same thing happened again, I was told it was because there was so many people there and it was over 100 degrees outside. So, I ordered the house margarita which was better but not great. For my entrée I ordered the sweet pork enchiladas and it was cold, the pork was dry and hard, it just tasted overly sweet WOW! I did not enjoy that meal, my hubby got the spinach enchiladas and his was also not hot and the tortillas were soggy swimming in a lot of liquid. Not sure if this was an off day or what. But the food quality was sub par. I really hope this improves, we might return again in the future."}
{"text":"I really do love this place, as it is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the Valley (we live in Scottsdale and make the drive frequently). 
The atmosphere is amazing and very festive during the Holidays. 
My absolute favorite on the menu is the Squash Blossom Soup which is seasonal and delish! The flying saucer is killer as well as the Carne Asada Platter. Salads are ok, but I wouldn't bother when there is so much great food to eat here.
I wish they had fountain soft drinks (because they are yummier) but their's are bottled (plastic bottles)...but then again, there's always a yummy margarita to be had! 
Tia Rosa is a Valley favorite and a really good restaurant!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. I am hungry waiting for boyfriend but they won't seat me until he is here. They are not packed. I am not a disjointed party of eight. Is there a reason I can't be seated? Every time I come here which is not often something is not quite right. Never again. Food was ok. My lips still have grease on them. I've been here a number of times & fail to see why people think it's so great. Service was good once my full party of two arrived."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants of all times. I have gone to Tia Rosa's for many occasions. Friendly staff, quick service, and delicious food. I love the seafood and fish tacos. Yum!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at Tia Rosa's. The service is always great.  Tonight I made the mistake of ordering the beef Chimichanga.  The meat was so dry and a little burnt.  I needed to drown it in sour cream and guacamole to choke it down.  The tortilla was perfect, how can you go wrong with the crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside delicious tortilla.  I don't think I've ever met a chimichanga I didn't love until now.  Maybe the manager will read some reviews and work on the burnt dried out meat.  I had the seafood enchiladas last time and they were great.  I am leaving tonight with a bad(burnt, dried out) taste in my mouth. Please pass the water and pass this restaurant if you are hankering for chimichanga!"}
{"text":"not the typical mexi food... this place is more like gourmet style mexi food. and delicious. 

way out in east mesa (the boon docks as far as i'm concerned), this huge rest. gets packed every weekend. this is seriously some award-winning food. like the pan seared chicken in ancho chile peach glaze, or the chicken mole. i believe all their ingredients are organic, but i can't seem to find anything to attest to that online, so don't hold me to it. if you want yummy, upscale mexi food, this is the joint."}
{"text":"This is so far from Mexican in my opinion. I will never eat here again or recommend this place. I ordered a fish taco that was served with a sweet sauce on it.  Fish and sugar?  Really. The guacamole was runny like pureed peas. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"As a newcomer to the Southwest, I had been looking forward to some tasty Mexican food. The Rancho de Tía Rosa seemed promising, especially given its cute hacienda décor. Unfortunately, I thought the food here was just okay. I was surprised that both the salsa roja and the salsa verde both tasted sweet. There was no hint of chiles in either. They were edible, but the salsa verde, especially, tasted as if it had sugar directly poured into it. The lunch specials were a good deal, but nothing special. My cheese enchilada was very bland, although I did enjoy the oozy cheese. The cheese was all I could taste. There was a hint of chicken broth in the refried beans, which I liked, but again, they could have been better flavored. As for dessert, the options looked exciting, and my mom and I opted for the cream-filled churros with the cinnamon ice cream. I expected warm churros, but these were cold and so stiff that when I bit into one, the other half flew across the table and landed in front of my mom! I was disappointed because I'm usually a huge fan of churros. The one plus was that the servers were very attentive; however, I would appreciate it if the server didn't use pet names in the future that are as sugary as the salsas."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dining experience this evening at Tia Rosa's. As usual!! Our server Cierra is always so friendly and attentive. Such a pleasure!! And the food was delicious. I must say we are regulars, and the food is  
always great!!"}
{"text":"The chicken Mole was the best ever! Cooked to perfection spiced to please the palette and I've had homemade mole from Oaxaca Mexico. It's not for everyone but worth a try. A combination of over 22 spices chocolate and cinnamon balanced. Yum. Fresh homemade guacamole. Warm chips not greasy! You can ask for no salt on the chips. Margaritas top notch tequila resposado anejo Patron, Blue Agave. All the good stuff. Flan is not flimflam. Muy Sobrosas and reasonable. Not typical Text Mex. More like real Mexican food. Spinach enchiladas filled with whole leaf fresh. Con Carne with roasted corn. Fabulous. Clean, excellent service and a fun festive but not over done atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Mexican restaurants. Large selection on the menu. Corn side is yummy. I don't give it 5 stars because it's a little pricey and they charge for chips and salsa in the bar area, even when ordering a meal."}
{"text":"Disappointed. We used to enjoy this establishment regularly until they closed. Note they are reopened under new management.  We had to wait to have our drink order taken for about 15.  No one came to our table after we were seated. Strange. The chips and salsa arrived 10 minutes before our drink order was even taken. Salsa was very bland! I asked for something different and they brought me some sauce that just tasted like red chili. Food came and was mediocre... Just nothing to even comment on.  Our waitress just forgot about us. We had to ask other servers to refill our drinks.  We had to wave someone else down again to get our bill and pay it.  I'm really disappointed because it's a fun atmosphere and close to home.  Hope they get things straightened out."}
{"text":"Just what I was looking for. Tia Rosa has a great decor for a tourist type restaurant which is what I wanted. The service was good. An overly friendly waitress was just what I was looking for. We didn't order drinks so our dinner was delivered before the three of us got through our first round of chips and salsa. In fact our dinner came so fast we told the server that we were unsure if it was our order. Again fast food, we were hungry, just what we wanted. The food was good and there was plenty of it. That means take home boxes. Just what I was looking for."}
{"text":"The food is delicious (but not necessarily authentic), and the restaurant itself has a unique personality all its own. Try the shrimp tacos, the beef chimichanga, or the pineapple and avocado salad. 

This used to be a great place to host a group or party. Unfortunately, the quality of service has suffered since the change in ownership. Go here for a lovely dinner with two to four people, but go somewhere else if your group is larger than that."}
{"text":"This place is just ok...I ordered the shrimp enchilladas which were kinda bland. I am giving it 3 stars because we were seated quickly despite their being like 10 people waiting and the service was good. But i live in tempe and the food is just not worth the drive I can get this same food at garcia's or arriba's with a little more seasoning."}
{"text":"Love it. Beautiful atmosphere, great customer service and fresh food. A little pricey but worth it for a fun evening out. My only complaint is that they are closed both Sundays and Mondays--seems a little excessive but that's just me. I highly recommend the cheese enchiladas with green sauce. To all my veggies out there, never fear! Their beans are safe for us :) For many years we have been and will continue to be frequent customers."}
{"text":"We've been going to Rosas since it was a little taco shop in Mesa. After our last experience at Rancho de Tia Rosa's we won't be going back. The quality of their food has significantly decreased. However, it wasn't until we had absolute horrible service from our waitress,Tasha, that was the last straw. Very sad."}
{"text":"Richelle is amazing...& we have only just begun!!! She is very attentive to us, friendly, and fun to talk with. Thanks for letting us sit in her section!"}
{"text":"Seating took a while, chips came out cold. Tipped the chips guy and lady (Maria) and all of a sudden he brought piping hot chips every few minutes. Order took a while to receive, wasn't hot. Server was nice but they seem short staffed. Refried beans only come one way- a nasty smoky taste."}
{"text":"Our night has been made perfect with Richelle. She has a great personality, knows the menu, and has grservice. Thanks Richelle."}
{"text":"We were so bummed when they shut down. Way better than any other 
Mexican resturant in the valley. Try the beef enchiladas or the flying saucer, both excellent. While they were closed we went back to the original in Mesa , not even close."}
{"text":"What a cool authentic setting that greets you upon walking into the outdoor patio filled with over 100 plants.

Lots of open beam wood work gives it a rustic but classy setting.

We had a group of about 15 and the service was very good.  My food was great and as far as I know everyone in our group had a great meal"}
{"text":"There are very little Mexican restaurants in Hawaii, so I really didnt have much experience in the way of Mexican cuisine other than tacos and such.  Anyway, got recommended this restaurant by family, and it was great.  

The ambiance is clearly not some people's forte, but to me, it was casual, fun and just plain worked.  

We had a party of 11, so we expected a longer wait than normal, but truly, the wait wasnt that bad, maybe 30min.  And as a walk-in at 6pm on a friday, thats pretty good to me.  

The food (carne asada) was great.  Flavor, appearance and aroma was just excellent.  My uncle swears by the shrimp tacos though.  The chips were just heavenly, we all almost filled up on chips and salsa before the food got to us.

Their Customer service is not really much to brag about, but its not bad, so I dont mind.  The seem to try to do their best with the amount of customers and noise that they have."}
{"text":"Last time I ate there it was good. There flying saucer is really a good dish."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is amazing and the service to match it. I have gone with just my wife and with big parties and got the same service. Recommend this place to any and everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!   Hard to find but once you do you are in for a treat!  The Carne Asada and fish Tacos are the best in town. The service is great and the atmosphere is out of this world."}
{"text":"Happy hour Saturday was phenomenal! Loaded Nachos were packed with chicken. Green corn tamale required a second to go and the desserts were worth coming back for alone. 

All this goodness plus drinks for $30. We will be back next week for sure."}
{"text":"Our second bowl of chips came back unsalted, but I did not mind, and my friend just asked for a shaker.  Our wait was reasonable, but we received our food sooner than we we expected, and we loved it!  The staff was great!"}
{"text":"All of us have their own special opinions of Restaurants, so here's mine: We live in a Town devoid of very good to excellent restaurants. There are restaurants but not offering the quality or service that we enjoy. We drove 45 minutes to this restaurant to meet with four other friends on July 02, 2012

We arrived around 5 PM due to some work schedules. We were seated right away as this was before \"the rush.\" What to order? I remember the first time my wife told me of the fish tacos that she had in Mexico. I still can't \"touch that.\" When others heard FISH TACOS, two ordered them BUT with a slight difference----the item had one fish and one crab taco! It was claimed that the crab was sweeter than the standard fish taco. Ok, but still not for me! I ordered the shredded beef burro--it was just plain big! But I finished it anyway:)

The table service was excellent-drink refills and a resupply of chips/salsa without hunting for the waitress. The restrooms were very clean with no issues. The restaurant appeared to be problem free and I would highly recommend it to all!"}
{"text":"I am so frustrated!! I stopped in to have a fish taco and was told that just one taco is not an option. I was told I had to buy a two taco plate. THAT'S ABSURD! I'm not going to spend money on an entire plate of food that I can not eat, it's too much food! I ended up eating chips and beans for lunch when all I wanted was a FREAKING FISH TACO! 
I won't be back because this was a horrible experience! I wish I had just walked out !"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to come here again for such a long time now.
It is one of my girlfriends best loved Mexican Food places. But, we never find ourselves out in this part of town too much.
We came in for an early dinner. about 4 :15.
We were greeted and seated in a great booth right away.
Chips and salsa are delish here no doubt.  The green and the red sause are amazing.
It is decorated very nicely.  Drinks were good. Teresa was given fresh coffe,(her absolute favorite with Mexican food.
She got the Crab enchiladas and I got the chicken enchiladas. AWESOME!
Good thing this is not too close to us,we would gain far too much.
lots of parking and nice clean restrooms as well.
Too bad it is so hot outside, because the patios are beautiful!"}
{"text":"Amazing salsa, attentive staff. I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas. There mole is top notch! I will be back again!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years! The food has always been pretty good. Their tacos are alright. They have always been nice to us. I have gone unto other restaurants and left this behind not sure if I'll come back here."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times with the in-laws and it really is not very good, not bad mind you but not what i want from mexican food. I would call this more mexicali food with a lot more Cali than Mexi. Good for those that don't like much spice or real Mexican food. There is always a wait on weekends."}
{"text":"Over priced and disgusting food.  Beans outta a can and premade shells???  Better Mex food elsewhere and expensive lunch.  Chips and salsa were gross....

I cannot for the life of me understand what people see in this place - other than the decor. Don't waste your time here folks....A LOT of better places with a lot better food and prices!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice the first time for breakfast and it was amazing! Went last night for dinner and a roach decided to join our dinner table. We were moved to another area, at which time everyone no longer wanted to eat. Another wait staff came into our area (I'm unsure if they knew what just happen to us at our other table) and demanded we move to another table. Still in shocked and grossed out I said no. Then we decided to leave, I told the wait staff and they were like ok bye. Like we were such a bother to them. No sorry, just excuses as to why there was a roach in their restaurant, like it was a paying guest too! They provided no customer service at all! I truly feel sorry for the other people that sat in that booth and ate there the remainder of the night. I will never be going back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast.  If you are looking for something fresh and exciting for breakfast check them out.  We had excellent service from Adam.  It was our first time in for breakfast so we sampled several menu items and shared.  The butter sauce for the pancakes is liquid crack!  We were also given a sample of their smoothie.   It made my hubby a yogurt lover.   The gravy on the biscuits n gravy was not heavy like everywhere else.  The chirozo gives it a yunique touch."}
{"text":"We went to Tia Rosa on a Saturday afternoon, just before it got very busy.  I am a total Mexican food lover and I have to say Tia Rosa was a delight.  The menu was so diverse. I had the carne asada and my partner the chili relleno. Both were fabulous. The carne asada could easily feed two. Based on reviews we also ordered the bean dip. Totally amazing- smokey and huge. Don't miss it. Our waitress Melissa was the icing on the cake. She was attentive, funny and helpful in our margarita choices. We can't wait to go again and it is worth the long drive!"}
{"text":"food was absolutely horrible!!!! the meat inside my chimi was SO dry not to mention the rice and beans were almost inedible, save your money & time going somewhere else where the service probably won't be as bad. :-)"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is a must stop for Mexican food, especially if you live in the East Valley.  I haven't been to Tia Rosa's in about 5 years, and boy has it improved.  The trees have grown so much that we drove past it twice because we didn't see the sign.  Tia Rosa's has two options, their front take-out restaurant and the main dining area.  It's just what you would expect when you walk into the Mexican style Hacienda, a water fountain and great courtyard for eating outside.  The menu is diverse and there are several vegetarian options.  I went with the Spinach enchiladas served with roasted corn and black beans, they were fantastic!  The table ordered carne asada, a beef burrito and the fish tacos.  All raved about the food.  The only complaint that we had was the salsa was just okay, it wasn't hot enough and their hot sauce was not very tasty.  We all wish we had a little more spice in our dishes, but the overall consensus is still a solid 4. If you decide to dine at Tia Rosa's try to get a table in the back courtyard or the room to the right of it, it will greatly improve the experience!"}
{"text":"I gave two stars because Salsa was so so sweet did not matter how much salt I put in it was still not salvageable.. Husband had Chili Rellenos and the sauce was the sweet salsa again.. Chimichanga was ok. No real spice just chicken put in flour tortilla and not topped with any special sauce.. the service was good had nice waitress but that's about it.."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant of all time... Good, tasty food, full bar with great cocktails (big, intact mint leaves in their mojitos) and great atmosphere. I've been frequenting both the restaurant and the taqueria for years and it's one of the reasons that I think it's good to be back in the 480.

However, I was semi-disappointed last night when my friend Jarrod and I went to the restaurant for dinner and when he asked for hot sauce on the side and we informed that it would be an extra $1.00. Seriously? Extra charges for hot sauce at a Mexican restaurant? I mean, that's like a bar charging for water...

When you go here, I highly suggest the green sauce. Whether it be as the salsa on your chips or the enchilada sauce, it is absolutely fantastic. Also a big fan of the shrimp tacos with their pineapple salsa - om nom nom.

Glad to be back where there is plenty of good Mexican food to eat rather than in SF where the best Mexican is in burrito form (no offense to SF burritos but there's more to Mexican cuisine than that - SF still rocks the house in weather and culture though)."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with my whole family to celebrate my little sisters birthday!

Food was really good! I like more of the more messy mexican style food, but it was still great! Our waiter was fantastic, always topping off drinks, and it seemed like he was just happy to serve us. We had brought a cake for my sister, but he also brought out a delicious free dessert. 

It's a beautiful restaurant. Colorful, festive, lots of cool art. The outside seating area is amazing. Flowers and plants everywhere, and a pretty fountain. There's a garden as you walk up to the door and the fresh flower aroma is so relaxing. 

Was pretty slow, but it was late on a Wednesday night; would be a great time to stop in to avoid a rush. Heard its crazy busy on weekends. 

I don't live on this side of town, but if I happen to be over here, I would definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed by this restaurant! The whole package. The food, the Staff, and the atmosphere. 

I went here on my birthday with 3 other people. We all got different dishes(Tortilla soup, Enchiladas, Tacos, Chimichangas). We were all able to taste all the different dishes and everything was perfect! It tasted home cooked, not frozen. Absolutely delicious!

For dessert we got the Fried Ice Cream, and the Sopapillas. OMG. I was in absolute heaven.

I definitely recommend you give that charming little place a try, you won't be sorry.  Come hungry!"}
{"text":"So sad. I've been a LONG time customer traveling to the former McKellips location which far exceeds the Gilbert location. Frequently when my husband is in the East Valley he'll swing by and bring dinner home (far west valley) with him. On Friday he stopped in and purchased two carne (trio) plates and was surprised that he had to purchase chips and salsa, but he did because we love them. Unfortunately when we got ready to eat saw that there was no green salsa - my favorite!  Also no grilled vegetables in either of the boxes - again one of the best parts of the meal so at 7:30 pm I called and asked to speak with the manager, but was told she was busy so they took my name and number and said she would call me back.   Not surprising no call back so at 11am on Saturday I called again no answer but left a message again no call back.   Called back again at 2:30 and the manager had just left so I left my name and number again and still no call back.  Very disappointing really poor customer service."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect.  I had never been to this location--just to the now closed one in Mesa--and from my Chicago home I was planning a surprise 80th birthday party for my stepmom.  I talked to Clay, the manager? a manager?, over the phone.  When he found out I was planning long-distance he kindly sent me pictures on my phone of the patio we would be on, and sent me the necessary menu info and pricing--which was extremely reasonable.  No extra private room charge like another Mexican restaurant in the vicinity.  Even said we had an inside backup private room if the weather didn't cooperate.  I crossed my fingers and signed the contract.  Best. Decision. Ever.  For a group of approximately 50, the service was fantastic--thank you, Chris, who was the waiter in charge.  It wasn't a buffet--I went with the abbreviated 6 item menu, making it more difficult for the servers.  Everyone was served promptly, water glasses refilled, drinks refilled.  I can't say enough great things about the experience.  Oh yes--the food was amazing.  I heard a lot of folks, who had never been there, saying they would return.  My stepmom said she couldn't have imagined a more perfect evening.  To everyone at Rancho de Tia Rosa, thanks for making me look like a SUEper hero! :)"}
{"text":"Lately my dad has been on a Tia Rosa's kick.  And when my dad gets on a restaurant kick, he likes to eat at that restaurant over, and over, and over.  And sometimes I get invited and come along.

After eating here a few times, I decided that it is simply just not deserving of the hype and traffic it gets.  The food is bland.  The salsa they give you is bland...even the \"hot\" one.  The quesadillas I got are bland.  The rice and beans?  You guessed it, bland.

They're definitely catering to the North Mesa crowd, whose Mormon pioneer ancestors apparently couldn't fit any spice in their wagons when they crossed the plains.

And would it kill you guys to put some cinnamon in the horchata?  Seriously...

Just go to their tacqueria across the parking lot and order the crab tacos with a Mexican Coke or Senorial Sangria... Much better option."}
{"text":"as seen on 8-22-11 - yellow sign on door says re-opening October 2011"}
{"text":"Someone recommended this place to us and it was a good restaurant, beautifully atmosphere.  The red sauce had sort of a smokey flavor, made with fresh roasted peppers.  The green tomatillo sauce was equally as good over enchiladas.  The only thing is I wanted one beef and one chicken enchilada and they would not do it.  I ordered two chicken enchiladas.  Strange because I've never heard of a Mexican restaurant that wouldn't give you one of each.  The nacho plate was huge and a meal on its own.   Super good food!"}
{"text":"love the  tacos- seafood option  i had the crab x 2 and shrimp x 1  next time i want to try salmon tacos"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went for a impromptu lunch date with my hubby, this was our first visit and decided to check it out. The decor was very cute and the restaurant was clean. The service was great, and very attentive. We both got margaritas my husband got the house margarita and I got the Madori melon margarita they were both tasty however I will say they do not hold back on the tequila. (Lol) for entrées my husband got the Monterey Monterey enchilada platter and he loved every bit of it. I got a steak fajita plate and it was so delicious. We were actually surprised at how good the food was. We decided to make it a tradition to go there at least once a month. I'm already Looking forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"My parents took my wife and I to Tia Rosa one night for dinner, and the line was so long we decided to return the next day for lunch. I'm glad we waited -- we were seated right away the next day, and it was quiet enough that we could enjoy the food and conversation! (It's just a hangup of mine -- I struggle to be heard in loud restaurants, and don't really enjoy shouting across the table, especially when my mouth is full of refried beans. I don't think the person sitting across the table from me enjoys it, either!)

I ordered the Flying Saucer which reminded me of a tostada all dressed up and tricked out -- it was delicious. I highly recommend it, although if you're hungry you'll probably want to order an appetizer or side. I also ordered a margarita with some magical combination of liqueurs -- I can't remember what was in it; only that it was tasty enough that my wife and I each had two! The dining area was extensively decorated for Christmas, and the service was prompt and professional, so everything came together for a truly enjoyable experience. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere day before Valentine's. Excellent service. Wait time but they make sure to go around and call your name out loud. Ordered too much food. We didn't need appetizers. The portions are huge. Definitely order to share each item and take home. Each dinner entree can easily feed 2 normal adults. Everything was tasty and fresh. Took home and reheated our main entres and it was excellent and fresh the next day. Everything tasted fresh and unique. Enjoyed the food very much"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken enchiladas and it came with rice and beans and smothered in a green sauce. The service was excellent the chips and salsa were constantly on the table and they have filtered water which is a big deal to me. My only complaint and it is small, is that I felt the enchiladas were just a little bit undersized for what I paid. Flavor was outstanding, the sauce was outstanding... I guess I just have a little bit bigger  appetite than that. All in all, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Truly confused about the food today. I have eaten at the original Rosa's and the food was great. The new Gilbert location is struggling to get me to ever want to come back. I ordered the Enchiladas Monterey and the beef was perfect then came the problem, the red sauce was tomato paste literally and the green sauce tasted like mango. Service was horrible from the moment we walked in, the hostess was not sure how long the wait was even though the dinning area had several tables open. The server was absent for the most part as all they did was submit our order."}
{"text":"Visited Rancho Tia rosa last night... Couldn't have asked for better South west Mexican! Started with Margaritas and afterwards, a bowl of black bean soup. Mmmm... Entree was the glazed shrimp quesadilla, again, exactly as advertised and very tasty. My wife enjoyed soft tacos and had to bring one home due to the size. We'll be back, soon."}
{"text":"This is a follow up to my review in February.  We had such a great first experience that I went back again.  This was a big mistake.

Next time I returned we were charged $5 extra from some extra sauce on the side of the Papas con Carne.  The dinner itself cost under $15.  What made it worst was our server never informed us of the high charge or made it right.  


The next time I decided to order the same dinner, but this time to go.  Never again.  Our to go was about half the size that is normally served in the restaurant.  No chips and salsa.

Come on Rancho de Tia Rosa!  You guys can do better.  Big disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming for years. Mckellips location burned down and have to come to Higley in Gilbert now. Just had our order taken after waiting 40 minutes to be seated and then 30 minutes at the table. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food! I love the carnitas. The patio is so pretty and relaxing."}
{"text":"I should've stopped at the salsa, which was strangely sweet. We tried two or three different flavors of salsa and it was like someone poured sugar in it. We went with our Canadian friends who loved it, although Canada is not a beacon for authentic Mexican food. My girlfriend and I were disappointed in the flavors of our food. While not inedible it was unauthentic. Definitely a \"Meh, I've experience better.\"

For those with a mild and bland palette this may be for you, but it didn't appeal to me whatsoever."}
{"text":"An appointment was running late so is decided to wait here. They had a $5 margarita special. The margarita was good, nothing amazing. Server had zip for personality but wasn't rude either. No chips or salsa were offered at the bar so I can't comment in that."}
{"text":"Great food! Prices are a little steep for the style of food. It's always hard to get in and out of. The taco shop in front makes it somewhat quicker but still gets cluttered with people for lunch."}
{"text":"While in AZ I thought any Mexican restaurant would be good, I was wrong. My husband's uncle and wife raved about this place so we tagged along for dinner. This restaurant is located in a plaza. Upon entering the resturant You notice it is decorated really nice. I loved the Spanish decorating and the whole restaurant vibe. When we arrived we had to wait for them to fix a large table so we took the kids to the bathroom. The bathrooms were nicely done as well and very clean. After we finished in the restroom we were seated and our waitress came out. She was very nice and she took our drink orders & salsa orders. They have a couple of kinda of salsas. I was not impressed by their house salsa --and usually I'm down for salsa and chips but this salsa was a no go. The chips weren't even great. I ordered the cheese dip and this was actually pretty good. I ordered a chimichanga but it was not good at all and there was no cheese in it or on top of it and it did not taste good. I ended up sending it back and not ordering anything else. I tried my daughter's and husband's food and I wasn't impressed with that either. This place only gets a two due to the decorations and the good service. Food wise ---they did not represent Mexican food right."}
{"text":"Best fish and shrimp tacos in the universe!  I love this place times infinity!

I make sure I go here at least 2 times every time I go to AZ.  

Seriously I want this now."}
{"text":"I was brought up in a Mexican household. I gave Tia Rosas one star because I just wasn't impressed with the food authenticity, and it's lack of flavor. I know a lot of people that love and swear by Tia Rosas, so perhaps it is just because I was brought up with actual authentic Mexican food though."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant!! The location could not be better and the food is perfect!!!!
For sure visit the patio, even in the summer. There are misters and large trees, great for groups, birthdays and business."}
{"text":"Let me first say, this is nothing like the original Rosa's down on University and Mesa Drive.  I loved that place when I was in high school and I have always had high hopes for the owners when they sold that place (last time I was there it had gone downhill) and spent a few years building the Tia Rosa's compound.  Everybody raves about this place, but I've been here half a dozen times since it opened a few years ago and always come away with a bad taste in my mouth.  I wait a few months or a year, and somebody tells me I should really give them another try, but I always have the same issues.

Reviewing this place is a six-part affair.  First, there is both the restaurant and the taco shop (separate building), and then the decor, the food, and the service of each.  Oh, and I'll throw in the parking, which is a nightmare if you're going for dinner at either place.  

A) The Restaurant
1. Decor - one of the best things about this place is that they spent tons of time making it look like a plaza right out of old Mexico, except brand new-ish.  There was music playing overhead, loudly in the entrance, not so much in the restaurant.
2. Food - I will say that it tasted fresh.  The chicken in my chimichanga tasted like it was from a rotisserie or a roaster, which was nice.  But nothing tastes Mexican.  It tastes like my grandma from Ohio put a lot of love into making a Mexican meal in her very Caucasian kitchen in Pataskala.  Even the salsa verde that came with the chips and normal-ish salsa tasted like it was made with apricot jam or blended with kiwi; it was that sweet.  I am told they grow many of their vegetables on-site; too bad they don't use spices.  The refried beans don't taste like anything other than pinto beans in water.  There are some little flecks of something they add to the sour cream if you ask for a side order, but it tastes the same as the stuff I buy at the grocery store, so it might as well be dirt in there.
3. Service - to call the hostesses at the tiki booth in front snotty is to compliment them.  Most times, we've just been ignored.  Once, we waited so long to be addressed that I got mad and dragged our whole party out.  When we do get noticed, we get attitude.  Tons of attitude.  I'm attaching a picture of the RULES on the board you are made to read before approaching the hostesses.  Notice there are three exclamation points on this one board!  That means you!  We have rules!  This and the miniature board three feet away at the entrance to the bar, also requiring you to \"ask!\" to be seated in the bar are where the hostesses get their power from.  I believe if you came in with a damp sponge and wiped off all the chalk from the boards, they would fall lifeless to the floor.  The wait-staff is generally friendly, but they never introduce themselves or do anything that goes above and beyond.  If you go for lunch, and are interested in the $5.99 lunch specials advertised on the sandwich board out by the street, they'll have to find you the little card that basically gives you the choice of a taco, three tacitos, or a burrito.  Hardly worth it.

B) The Taco Shop
1. Decor - Yeah, yeah, old Mexico, we get it.  This place is generally in sub-par condition with sticky tables and uncleared tables because all the staff stays behind the counter all the time (more on that later).  Again, there is music playing overhead.
2. Food - It's cheaper than the restaurant, I guess, so that's why it's a taco shop??  But, again, it tastes bland.  I mean more bland than Serrano's, and that's saying something.  Oh and there's no hot sauce to add anywhere.  Everything is pretty much a la carte.  The specials are special because they're tiny and very basic.  You can stop in here to eat cheaply and have a beer, but why stay when the only flavor you'll get is by taking it home to add some.
3. Service - The kids at the front counter are generally courteous in a minimal way.  They tend to have little idea what they are actually selling, as questions about what's on the menu, the specials, or in the food go over their heads.  There is usually a barker who calls out your order number and then leaves a giant tray with a few plates on it a the counter.  You must stand by or someone else will take your food because there is nobody there by the time you reach the tray.  I'm unclear as to whether I was expected to take the tray to my table, balance each of the individual item plates on my arms and head back to the table, or have everyone in my party grab their own food.  When done, I believe you're supposed to clear your own table, because there's the Ikea cafeteria-like receptacle near the garbage and some dirty dishes on table #6 that have been there since 2011.

So I've obviously got some opinions about this place.  \"Why, oh why do you keep going back?\" you might be asking.  People from all over town tell me how great the place is, and I honestly want it to be. At this point, I think I'm done."}
{"text":"Food was pretty average; I was disappointed versus my expectations set by other reviews.  Quite overpriced for what you get on the somewhat limited menu.  Service is friendly and good.  There are many other great mom & pop Mexican restaurants with better food and better pricing - go to those instead!"}
{"text":"Eh, had expected a lot more out of this place after reading the reviews and craving Mexican food here in Mesa.  Didn't quite deliver.

I needed a drink so I ordered a Golden Caddy margarita on the rocks - hold the salt, please.  This thing was good.

The food?  Not so much.  

I ordered the steak fajitas ($1.25 extra for NY Strip, which I ordered).  Well, when my food arrived, I saw a thin, low-quality, NY Strip steak in its entirety.  No strips.  No flaming fajita platter.  Nothing.  

I sliced my steak into strips and went ahead and filled one of my two flour tortillas.  The tortillas were quite big.  As a result, my entire steak filled about half of my first tortilla, leaving me with an extra tortilla and no meat.  My steak came with a side of rice, refried beans, and a little bit of chopped lettuce.  My meal really sucked.  

After I left this place, I immediately went to Sonic and ate grease (popcorn chicken) because I was still hungry.

Can't wait to hit the gym when I get back to the East Coast. 

So much for having a nice last meal in Arizona."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The back patio has a really nice cozy atmosphere with pretty lights and a fountain.  I fell in love with the green salsa they gave with the chips (you get both red and green).  The chicken mole dish was fantastic and came with amazing homemade tortillas that stood the test of time and didn't get brittle or soggy in the fridge overnight.  Huge portions too.  I also tried the house margarita on the rocks.  It wasn't too sweet or too tart and complemented the food nicely.  This place is definitely worth checking out, even if it is in Mesa."}
{"text":"This has been a family favorite for a very long time! Was in on Sunday and it was such a great atmosphere! Drinks were great! Food even better and had the sweetest waitress Makara! Had family drive 2 hours just to come to this restaurant for dinner. Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"A reply by the manager was left on my last review asking if I brought up the dry meat to my server. I didn't because it wasn't enough to spoil my experience and I'm not a picky eater to begin with. I hate to send back food and waste it when it's not at all that bad."}
{"text":"Honestly, I've had better Mexican food, but the outside patio and dining room is so beautifully decorated, I always make sure to bring out of state guests here.  The waitstaff has always been friendly and the food is served quick and piping hot.  The wait for a table during snow-bird season can be awfully long so be prepared."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time tonight and we were extremely surprised!  The restaurant has a beautiful patio. The customer service was amazing.   The food is fresh Mexican with a twist!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been debating on what to write in this review as I really wanted to give a higher rating.  The atmosphere was nice with some very cool decor. But we got seated in a back room next to the bathrooms where there were just a few tables. Both my husband and I had the carne asada. It was more of a chunky pulled style rather than a thin piece of strip steak. That was certainly not my preference.  All in all, I have had better Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ordered the carne asada.  It was ok.  The beef is pretty well flavored but was pretty dry if you didnt put anything on it.  Fresh flour torillas were good.  The red salsa was just hot and not flavorful, the green is sweet and flavorful but doesnt have enough heat.  Chips were kind of stale tasting.  I have had better experiences here, I think the fact they are getting really popular is taking some of the focus off the food."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. ^__^ The staff came by like every 5m to make sure everything was ok and to see if we needed anything else. We did a couple of their specialty tequilas, and I must say on a hot summer night like the one we went on this went down soooooo good. Nice and big and refreshing. Food came out almost immediately as if by magic. We did the taco and chimi sampler and both left me wanting for more. My only regret is that we had eaten like an hour before we joined some friends here, so I was unable to try more things off of their menu. Don't worry Tia, we def will be back soon. [="}
{"text":"Ok so I have been to many restaurants... and not all of them are that great but this one.... the prices they charge and the quality of the food is ridiculous! HORRIBLE food... great service though! :-D"}
{"text":"There are so many other Mexican food restaurants in this town, go elsewhere.  I have given Tia Rosas so many chances and am continually disappointed.  I am sad to write this review because I want to like it so badly, it's a great location and atmosphere but the goodness stops there.  The food is bad, the service is AWFUL.  They keep you waiting at lunch (check and food) constantly have dirty dishes, or things floating in your water, get your order wrong, and when it's right - it's just not good.  I've tried a lot on the menu: burritos, enchiladas, seafood enchiladas, fish tacos, Carne asada, etc.  Nothing at all worth talking about.  I hear the chicken mole is good but I'm not paying $15 for anything there.  The final straw came today when 1- there was food in my water glass, 2- my order came out wrong and 3- my $17 bill was rang up at $30.  No remedies for all of these folies were offered.  not going back.  No more chances."}
{"text":"When I visit my dad in Mesa, AZ, one of the first things he asks is when do I want to go to Tia Rosa. My response is, \"Are they open now?\", no matter what time of day I get in. This is my favorite Mexican food establishment in the US. I have tried many but none can compare and this visit this time was no different.

Because it is February in the Valley of the Sun, my dad and I head over to Ranch De Tia Rosa's for an early dinner. If you arrive after 4:30pm, no matter what day, be prepared to wait. This place gets busy! 

We arrived at 4:15 and were seated promptly. The drink order was taken and chips and salsa arrived quickly. 

I noticed a new item on the menu that I had not seen before, Sweet Pork Enchiladas with butternut squash sauce and caramelized apples. I decided to give this entree a try. Let's just say I have a new favorite at Tia Rosa's. The pork in this dish is to die for and the sauce just makes it even better. I tried so hard to finish it all because it was so good. I am so glad that I took a doggy bag back to my dad's as the leftovers were just as good the following day."}
{"text":"Not sure on authentic but the shrimp taco is great, pineapple seems to be the key to its great taste"}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a \"revolving door\" because you will want to come back over, over, over.

The atmosphere itself is something to visit. Very unique from the corner of the room to the outdoor seating area... its candy for the eyes!

Very unquie and familiar menu items. I was most interested in the mashed-like potatoe side with entree meals. I had not had that experience at previous Mexican eaterys state side or in Mexico. Very good.  I also love love love the squash soup. Very flavourful and smells wonderful with clove spices =D

Overall, great atmosphere, great food and unique dishes! The only down is service is lacking. Body language is not enough to alert staff for assistance."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great prices on the lunch specials and the entire family loved the food... Even our picky kids. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The absolute best chile rellano I have ever eaten.  This had cheese, pine nuts, and a great sauce.  I had to ask for a spoon so as to get all the great sauce. Food is a 5+ star rating.    Wife had a mango, chicken, and avocado salad.  Ambiance, waitstaff, and prices are 4 star.  Our booth was in the center courtyard, which is actually inside but looks like a charming outdoor plaza in Mexico.  A great place to enjoy a leisurely meal.

We love Tia Rosa and go here every time we visit the Phoenix area.  It is a must place

UPDATE: October 2013  We tried the little takeout place in front of the parking lot.  It was probably the best takeout Mexican I have ever had.  The takeout it probably 5 star by itself.  My only complaint is that they do not feature the chile rellano here.  Darn!"}
{"text":"Still a five-star restaurant. Once again, I had the Nuevo Chile Rellano, and as I've said before it's the best Rellano I have ever had. Our server was Shawn, who earned my 30% tip for being attentive, intuitive, and added so much to our dining experience.  Others in our party had their favorite dishes and also raved about the quality of the food.

I believe that all the magic from the prior location has been transferred to the new place on Higley.  The old location has different owners and has been renamed with a soundalike to confuse the diner."}
{"text":"If this place was being rated on the atmosphere alone it would be 5 stars.  The service was great and the food ranged from average to really good.  The prices are to me a bit high for the quality of food.  Recently I have had a chance to eat at several low cost, very high quality family owned Mexican food resturants.  I must say.. the very very best foods come from the most unexpected places."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fresh and fun and a true focus on customer service. This authentic experience is a must for all East Valley residents."}
{"text":"Love this place!
The food, the atmosphere & the service is spot on!
Love my neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"last nites nightmare just confirms my dining out on a Saturday  is for the very patient . some friends are in town and they wanted to go here for dinner ,mind you the setting is quaint and the food is good (not killer) but good we showed up right at prime dining time ...well at least east valley dining time 630 ish and the place was packed ..we decided to go for it only because our guests were wanting to eat here ..fine i have no problem i decided to go with the flow after a hard day of working and a bitchy wife ragging in my ear . i gave the very nice young lady our name and she says ...it will be a 45 minute wait.....i NEVER wait more than 5 minutes ,45 minutes  OK I'm going with the flow as we stood there for 20 minutes i asked one of the employs if we could get some chips and salsa while we waited  ..he says   I DON'T KNOW...??? i said can you check he walked away and  then when he returned he 
said yes its 3 dollars ...i said is that the same chips and salsa you get for free at the table ???yes he said hmmmm never mind its not the 3 dollars its the principle. we were finally seated after some more confusion on what table we were to be seated at ,we were brought water and that FREE bowl of chips and two small ramicans of salsa  and then we sat for another 10/15 minutes before our server got to take our order ,she says look s like your ready to order ....YOU THINK! as we sat there for another 30 minutes waiting for our food i was bound and determined to get my fill of those free chips and salsa although it looked like they were starting to ration the salsa since i had to ask 3 times for more salsa. The table next to us were seated before us and we got our food first they were starting to get a little pissy ,they asked for somthing to hold them over and the wait person said the only way to get ??? was to order ???  the women said just forget it and asked for the manager .the manager came to there table and said were serving over 700 dinners tonite like it was those damn customers fault this table had not got there food and told them there was 4 tickets in front of theres but there food should be up in the next 15 minutes .....wow really maybe bring this table the bean dip or whatever it was as a justure of CUSTOMER SERVICE....CHIPS SALSA RING A BELL ... ok i cant be to harsh on them it was a zoo but i really think they need to work on there customer service a little more"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great food and five stars for the service! Highly recommend the bean dip, carne asada & the salmon & crab tacos. Our waiter Andrew was fantastic--so responsive, personable & made our night so fun."}
{"text":"Was excited to see they serve breakfast the setting is very nice with a great outdoor seating area which is wear I chose to have breakfast today. I ordered the biscuits with gravy top with a spicy chorizo sausage served with two links as well and 2 eggs the staff was nice but did not seem overly knowledgeable about the options on the menu, not well trained or informed . My breakfast came quickly unfortunately it was luke warm at best, I asked for my eggs to be poached and they came out basted which was no big deal but nothing was said by the waitperson not that the young lad probley new poached from basted from over easy ect. I might attempt this place again maybe for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"This was some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The salsa was horrible and the rice was as far from authentic as you can get. I'm curious what box brand they use because what I just ate was not made in-house from scratch at all. I should have known better. When Mexicans avoid the place, you know the food is not good. Will never be back..."}
{"text":"We are fans. HUGE fans. We will be back next visit to Mesa!

We were seated and immediately greeted with fresh in-house chips and salsa by the sweetest little lady who had a perpetual genuine smile on her face the entire time we were in the restaurant. She was a gem. The chips smelled lovely and my dining companion said the salsas tasted very fresh. Gluten warning: Asked our server and yes, it's a shared fryer, watch out for the chips if you are sensitive. 

Happy hour until 6!! Good lord this margarita is ...woohooo moreish! If I wasn't so exhausted, I would have happily had more. Definitely tiny lime wedge but not tiny tequila! Packed a punch. 

Gluten free items are clearly marked in the menu. But please do ask your server if you have any questions.

Open kitchen and do those folks back there HUSTLE. Not one minute slacking off, impressive commitment to service.

Decided for my gluten free choice to have the sweet pork enchilada with butternut squash sauce, apples and rice & black beans.  Enchilada. did I mention there were TWO?!!! HUGE, delicious sauced enchiladas with Apples on sweet enchiladas... would never think I would like it but I did!

Check the photos - the plate was FULL.  Black beans were good, the wee salad was a nice refreshing touch, I could have used a bit more greens, but I was so full, I was happy to have 1/2 my meal to take home for a snack later or lunch tomorrow!

Smoked baked beans!!!! 

My other half ordered the fajitas, and you can choose your meat(s). OMG pork & chicken fajitas - definitely would order again, beef was good, but a little off for my palette...Alberta beef and all, we're spoiled.

No room for dessert... and we really really wanted to.

Happy hour tomorrow... sî!"}
{"text":"My favorite authentic Mexican food in the East Valley! The food is always amazing and the green salsa is worth coming for alone!! It gets quite busy so be prepared to wait. When it's busy it feels like you're in the way while walking through the restaurant because the servers are always in a hurry and they could probably save themselves some time by providing larger containers for chips so you don't have to ask them to keep refilling it. Overall, I really love this restaurant and enjoy eating there anytime I'm town."}
{"text":"Rude employees! Read other people's reviews before you go here...the service here is horrible!  The employees taking orders are very rude and act annoyed that you're even there.   The main restaurant is actually closed.  Don't waste your time go to a different restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's not the same with the new owners. My family and I weren't fans. The salsa was watery, and the food tasted under-cooked. New staff also wasn't as warm and friendly as the previous staff. We love Tia Rosa's but things can change with new ownership."}
{"text":"So we do not live on the east side but were visiting family and a local recommended this place to us. 

We arrived around 2pm on a Saturday for a party of 14 and a high chair. The place despite it being in a strip mall is gorgeous! Inside and out. I was rather impressed and it was very clean. 

At first I was really urked when speaking to the hostess because I told her we needed a table for 14 with a high chair. She told me to tell her when my whole party was arriving?! I was like everyone is traveling from different directions to meet for lunch ( Gold Canyon, Pine and El Mirage) I really don't want to stand at the front of your restaurant with my 2 children to wait for my whole party to arrive. She still made us wait. Finally a few of our party arrived and we told her we would like to be seated since the ones who arrived were our elders and can't \"stand\" around. I literally had to snap at her and say we weren't waiting for the rest of our party and she needed to sit us.....Need to have your hostess learn some hospitality and common sense. 

But they did finally sit us in our own secluded section and it was perfect for our big group since we are a huge group and not always everyone's cup of tea. Our server really did a good job keeping up with all of us ( sadly can't recall his name) 

There green salsa is disgusting! I was reading the reviews and unless you like sweet verde sauce, pass on it. 

Everyone enjoyed their food and no one seemed to have any complaints. He was really nice about splitting everyone's check so we only had to pay for our own party. 

For two adults and 2 kids (who both ordered a cheese crisp) it came out to $50 without the tip. I think my husband ordered an enchilada and I ordered the carne asada. 

Stepped outside to smoke after dinner and they have beautiful furniture arranged next to a roaring fire in a chimey. Could have sat there all day!"}
{"text":"Average to below average. But I'm comparing it to Mexican food in San Diego. The best thing was that the portion sizes were generous, you could easily share one plate between two people. And no one will complain about the food being too spicy. Or too tasty.

But that's large portions of average food. The shrimp tacos was ok if overly sweet. The fish taco was meh. There was a chicken dish and my main thought was, man that's a lot of chicken, I could take it home and make something interesting out of it."}
{"text":"After the response from the GM, Clay wanting to make things better for me from my original review posted on here a month ago, I still have yet to get a call back from him. I did call him per his request from a facebook message. Unfortunately, I called at a bad time (6pm), and I knew that, so I left my name and number with Clay and expected a call back because he was very busy at the time. I understood, but it has been over 3 weeks now. I was hoping to share with him my bad experience. I was not looking for a free dinner. Just a chance to let him know how was treated and ignored once the hostess realized my party of 3 was waiting for a friend just a few minutes away. However, if you saw my review from less than a month ago she was very rude and never offered to seat us in the cantina area, and I didn't even think of that since my son was just 14. But either way, I'm done with trying to resolve my treatment with Clay and assure you I will not be back for to try and make things better."}
{"text":"Having dinner AGAIN with the family and the best waitress EVER!! \"Sierra\" we love you. Glad that bitch \"Isabel\" isn't here hosting tonight. Never want her seating me again. She's RUDE and smells! Clean personal hygiene is highly important being that you're the first employee to greet customers."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!!! Very cheap, lots of margarita choices, and good food. Did not try the reg menu, but plan on coming back for that."}
{"text":"My daughter and son-in-law scheduled their rehearsal dinner for a Friday evening on the outside patio.  Unfortunately the weather did not cooperate and there was no way that they could have an outside dinner.  I received a call three hours before the schedued dinner time and was offered anything I needed to make this dinner possible.
In less than two and one-half hours workers were at my house delivering more food than what was needed.  They set everything up and had the buffet looking like it was at a catering hall.  They took care of every detail and even offered to bring tables and chairs if needed.  When the bridal party and out of town guests arrived from the rehearsal they were able to enjoy a meal that was both beautiful to look at and delicious to eat.  Everyone was amazed at the job that Tia Rosa did and people were thrilled with the quantity and quality of the food delivered.  I cannot thank them enough for the fantastic food and service.  They really care about any event special.

{"text":"#3 Tia Rosa's has fresh hand made tortillas and an amazing atmosphere.. Feels like you pulled up to a fancy joint south of the border. You can tell that the owners spent some money putting this place together..The food is outstanding here and there are some very creative dishes..  If you are looking for a Mexican joint that will impress your business friends, then Tia's is the Mexican palace-restaurant that I would recommend..  Unfortunately the palace is a little too pricey and the service is not worth writing about..  That is why poor Tia is #3 on my list"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has gotten anything more than 2 stars.  I gave 2 stars for the decor and the atmosphere.  I live by this place and this was my third visit here only because our regular Mexican place was closed, salsa cabana. 

I had the chicken chimi with rice and beans. It was ok, could have been better, temp of food was warm not hot.  Wife had the veggie burrito.  This was a bean burro with lettuce?  The rice and beans were bland.  This place is not for me, I like my Mexican food to taste authentic not like taco bell. Wait I would have gave taco bell 3 stars because it's fast food Mexican and I know what to expect there.  

We had to buy chips and salsa, really?  Every Mexican food restaurant gives you this. For me this is why I go to get Mexican food."}
{"text":"I wasn't very happy with this food, I would rather go to taco bell.  Over priced food with staff members that can't tell you what part of Mexico the food orginated from.  I will never go back!!"}
{"text":"Love the horchata and margaritas! The food is great as well. My favorite salsa is the green salsa and I literally crave it throughout the year."}
{"text":"Place is really nice.  This is the kind of place you would take an out of towner.  I thought their salsa was great.  I had a red carnitas enchilada, although I thought the meat was delicious, I think the rest lacked flavor.  My wife had the nachos, and she thought it was loaded with beans, which took away from there rest of the ingredients.  She also ordered a frozen horchata smoothie, which tasted more like a piña colada.  I thought the service was good, however our server was new so he wasn't very familiar with the menu and could not answer many questions about it.  Overall, I will say the food was just ok, the pricing was a little higher than other places, the facilities were excellent, so we will try again and see if maybe the cooks just had an off night."}
{"text":"Food was served cold (not room temperature but refigarator cold), server took both meals  back. When he returned he said he but them in the oven for awhile,  now it was dried out and the sour cream turned to a white liquid. Salsa was very sweet for some reason and the chips were soggy."}
{"text":"I went here with family back in the 90's while on vacation and fell in love.  I now live in Phoenix but in the west valley.  It is almost an hour away and I will gladly drive all the way to Mesa to eat the best Mexican food in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I hate to be a jerk, but I am not a fan. When I think Mexican food I envision spicy food that makes my nose run and bold flavors that dance along my tongue...unfortunately my dreams were crushed at Tia Rosa. So, with that said. If you have super bland taste (which there is nothing wrong with that), or love sweet sugary syrup on your tacos, then this is the place for you. If not, stay away."}
{"text":"I started going here because of there Mesa location. They have the best shrimp tacos and beef enchiladas. Also if you like chips and salsa you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We love this place!!!!  When out of towners come to visit it is where we go.  We have never had a meal that wasn't great.  The atmosphere is fun and great for our two kids.  I usually get the salmon and I love it, so much so that I can't get myself to try anything else.  My husband enjoys eating and like to try a different dish each time, always happy with his meal.  Our out of towners now look forward to eating there when they come to visit.  We have always had good friendly and attentative service.
I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Such a great Mexican restaurant! The best green salsa in Arizona! Sweet and tangy and you can't get enough. The shrimp tacos are unbelievable and I can't seem to get anything else when I go."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food I have ever had.  Staff was good too.  Salsa is awesome."}
{"text":"Madeline was our server and provided us with five star service! Food was good and the environment is top notch. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"For me this place is out in the middle of nowhere, but if you are anywhere within the 20 mile radius-you must go! 

Today I tried the take-out building for lunch/ 1 and the service was great! Very nice and knowledgeable about the menu.  BTW there are plenty of tables to eat in at.
I had the new salmon tacos with their mango salsa (that I crave regularly) and with a little green salsa to even out the sweetness they were perfect and plentiful.  The salmon had a tiny bit of crunch on the edge and the rest was perfectly moist.

Usually I can resist eating all the corn tortillas...not here! Too darn good. 

For $10 I got 2 huge fish tacos & an even bigger soda. Great value!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I showed up around 7:00 PM and being the day before new years they were busy for a Wednesday night. We decided to sit at the bar to avoid having to wait for a table.  The bar was completely trashed with cups and food smeared all over the table. That same food, cups, and trash remained on the bar the entire time that we were there. I even pointed the out to the bartender (Johnathan) and he still ignored it. Even when things slowed down he never bothered to clean the mess. The bar was filthy and the bartender could care less. Another couple showed up after us and asked nicely if he could wipe down the section in front of them.  He just handed them a towel and asked that they clean it themselves because he could not reach and would have to walk around to the other side to clean it.  

I later complained to the manager on duty (Clay)  and he seemed to care less about the situation not even taking the time to turn around and see what I was talking about. As i was speaking he quickly responded with a repeated \"okay\" but never apologized or provided empathy for what I was saying.  That guy should never be in a management role and never really provided any resolution to anything that we mentioned.  I will never go back to this restaurant.  It is really sad because I feel in love with the food from the original Rosa's and expected the same great experience that me and my family have always had in the past.  I'm sad to say that this new restaurant on Higley road is poorly managed and the customer service does not exist. I will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"We decided Rancho de Tia Rosa must think very highly of themselves, by the high prices they charge! We stopped i today at 3:00pm because we had a Local Flavor coupon. There were just a few tables full of people, so they were not crowded at all. We did have a very nice and personable waitress, and from what we saw, she was the ONLY waitress working. We placed our orders, and the wait was on. In the interim, a handful of more people came in.  Our waitress was busy taking care of the other diners, and I could see our food was up-- waiting to be picked up and served to our table. Our waitress was so busy, a busboy finally picked up our food and brought it to our table. By the time it arrived, it was lukewarm at best!  In my opinion, it was not very good either. It probably would've tasted a lot better had we received it when it was still hot. As slow as the business was, there was no reason why we shouldn't have received our meals as soon as they were done!! I'm sure we will not be returning anytime soon. The prices are way too high for the food we got. Nothing was said to our waitress -- she was busy, and we didn't see a manager around, so we just left. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone wanting good Mexican food!
We were NOT impressed!"}
{"text":"We love Tia Rosa's and the fact that they built this one nearby! We go at least once a week and typically the service is great. I love the salmon and shrimp tacos- and the beans! This isn't \"authentic\" Mexican but different and very enjoyable.  I love the decor and all the beautiful plants on the patio."}
{"text":"Finally remembered to try out tia Rosa's since they reopened.  I still liked the rice and beans, though they were skimpy on the servings on both. The beef still had the great smoky flavor but there was 1/3 to 1/2 of the normal amount of meat on my chimi. Disappointing. I normally have the same ratio of meat and tortilla left at the end to take home. Nope. I had an empty shell of fried tortilla....

That made it disappointing to me. Not the same bang for the buck so much more expensive than it was with the smaller servings."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix we popped over to Gilbert to view the Christmas on Comstock Light Show, 1st place winner of the ABC-TV Christmas Light Fight 2015. 

Hungry we consulted Siri for a local Mexican food restaurant. She sent us to Tia Rosa's a few blocks from Comstock.

Nestled in a nondescript strip mall in an upscale part of town, Tia Rosa's was packed on a Saturday night mostly with large family groups. The estimated wait time was 30 minutes so we had time to check the place out. First off a teenager (a random customer), who saw us coming opened the door for us. Very friendly. While people stood shoulder to shoulder in the reception area, whenever someone new arrived the sea of people turned, then parted for the newby to easily make their way to the waiting list. That was just the beginning of our pleasurable evening at Tia Rosa's.

Food. Hubby ordered a cheese enchilada dinner.  Not spectacular, but warm and appetizing. My green corn tamale with green sauce was tender and flavorful (recommended by the waiter). It was served with a small tostada on the side - corn tortilla, refried pinto beans, guacamole, cheese & lettuce. A meal in itself. If I lived in the area I'd order this again.

Ambiance. Lots of Mexican memorabilia fills all walls floor to ceiling. Charming. Quaint. Looks like it's been there for years yet the shopping mall looks pretty new. Quick, friendly service even though the place was packed to the gills."}
{"text":"Waited on by Dennis who takes initiative and accommodates his guests. Dennis is knowledgable of the preparation of the food. My second beer was delivered quickly upon finishing the first. The queso dip was really good. The flank steak chimi was super good. Will return."}
{"text":"Family owned, Awesome food and top notch customer service.
Seafood tacos FTW !

The Sirrine family who owns the place are truly honest and passionate about there restaurant. it truly shows in the quality and freshness of the food."}
{"text":"I love the green salsa, my wife loves the red. This is a great place for us when we want something out of the norm, or a special occasion. Never had a bad experience here, and I think I've tried everything on their menu!"}
{"text":"Love their happy hour food and drinks but their service is awful.  Took over 20 minutes to get seated at a table in the bar for 6 of us at 420pm on a monday when there were lots of empty tables.  Took another 20 min or more to get drinks.  Then another 20 min or more to give food order.  Only one waiter assigned to the entire bar area.  Lots of waiters and waitresses standing around in the restaurant area.  Unacceptable.  Hire some help.  You lost 6 regulars last night."}
{"text":"I grew up in Mesa but never heard of this place until last year. My husband and I had lunch there. What a disappointment that was. We were seated and waited for 15 minutes, still no server. I called over another server from across the room and asked who our server was. He pointed over to a young girl who was standing up against the wall talking, giggling and flirting with a male server. She had been over there the whole time and I didn't realize she was our server. Well things changed pretty quickly when I walked over to her and asked if we could get served because our lunch time was running out and we had already been there waiting for 15 minutes. No apology, just a little snicker and smile at the guy she had been talking too. After this experience, I didn't want to ever go back there. Well, this past weekend, we were in the area for business and my husband talked me into giving it another try. Another big disappointment! It was crowded but we were able to be seated after a 15 minute wait. The problem began with that. The hostess took us the wrong way and when she turned around to go the right way, five different servers got in the way and blocked me from following my husband and the hostess. One male server was even rude and made a nasty comment to me as I tried to make my way past them. One of the female servers giggled at his comment and shoved me into the wall. I lost sight of where my husband and the hostess went. I was so frustrated that I went back to the front of the resturant and just sat down to wait for the hostess to come back. She totally ignored me when she came back up to the station. I sat there for 10 minutes, texting my husband and then finally called him. It was so noisy he couldn't hear his phone at first. He finally came up and got me and took me back to our table. The person who brings chips and salsa and the male server who took our order were the best things about this place. They were both hispanic and a little older. The rest of the staff here look like a bunch of high school kids and they act like it as well. Very rude! Now on to the food- very bland, no flavor. My stuffed quesedilla had no flavor to it what so ever. Taco Bell serv es more flavorful stuff than this place. As my husband was trying to eat his fajita's, the bus boy-another young kid, took his basket of tortillas. He called out to the guy to bring them back and was just ignored. He had to wait for 10 minutes to hail our server and get more tortillas to finish his meal. The best thing about our meal was the beer and the strawberry marguerita. I can honestly say this place is a major disappointment and they are truly lucky that I am retired from broadcasting because I would certainly share my views on the airwaves. They should understand the first rule of any business, treat the customer with respect and don't be rude. Learn some manners. As we walked into the parking lot, we were discussing what just happened and we were overheard by someone apparently in management as she was unloading her car. She followed us and stopped us. She mentioned what she overheard and asked us for more information. We shared our experiences for both times we came here. She then said that they just had a staff meeting a week prior to discuss those very issues. REALLY????? Wow! Apparently the staff didn't listen and they obviously don't care about their reputation or how to treat people. After hearing this, I definitely know that I will never recommend this place to anyone nor will I ever step foot in there again. A real shame."}
{"text":"This place is a little out of my way, but when I'm visiting the folks in Mesa we come here.  The fish/shrimp tacos are good, as is the carnitas plate.  Great Mexican place to go to if you are trying to watch your carb in take.  Not a huge fan of the salsa or margaritas.  Love the outdoor patio seating."}
{"text":"Food is good but does not make up for the lackluster performance by the bar staff. I often eat here and get take out a couple times a week because it's around the corner from my house and like I said the food is good and price is reasonable. Dine in staff is friendly and I recommend it to anyone. Just dont go to the bar where they are to busy trying to be cool rather than getting the job done.

My last trip here I went in and ordered my food.  Simple, 2 tacos and a chicken burrito to go.  A side of chips and green salsa.  No problem.  I wait in the bar area, where I ordered and watched ESPN.  No biggie.  about 5 minutes in a guy brings a bag from the back.  I assume its my order but they do take phone in orders as well so I decide to wait as it could belong to someone else .  I continued to wait.  About 15 minutes have gone by and I am sitting at the bar looking at the bar tender while he talks to his buddies about the fantasy football schedule etc.. I eventually ask another employee if he could see where my food was.  He turns around and grabs the bag behind him and ask my name.  I tell him. He hands over the bag thats been sitting there for now 20 minutes.  WTF.  Bummer.   I live next door but it is more efficient to drive to Tia Rosa Taquiria on the other side of town than it is to see the clowns in action.  

I stopped going here now simply to avoid more issues and no longer recommend it to friends. 

it;s a bummer because the food is good but does not make up for a lackluster experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. So authentic and they serve you plenty of food.  I love their decor , this is what old Mexico use to look like , I think. Husband says salsa is not hot enough, I like it."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this restaurant is so busy and so highly rated on Yelp.

Positives: The restaurant, decor, and atmosphere is gorgeous! The wait staff was friendly, and I feel they did a decent job serving considering how busy the restaurant was. Those are the reasons I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of one.

Room for Improvement: The food was SOOO far from authentic Mexican it was shocking considering we live so close to the border. The food my husband and I received was the type of Mexican you'd expect in a random east coast town that had no clue; what is sometimes referred to as \"White Mexican.\"

The carne asada was bland and greasy and resembled more of a pot roast. The rice was bland and downright soupy it was sitting in so much liquid.  The refried beans had a barbeque, smokey flavor to them that was more reminiscent of baked beans than refried beans which was odd to me. The salsa had an overwhelming barbeque flavor to it as well, and hardly any spice to it. 

You also won't find your traditional \"combo plates\" on the menu. While they have their own \"unique\" version of combo plates, you will not find hard shell beef tacos with rice and beans on the menu. 

Bottom Line: Although this restaurant tries to create a unique perspective on Mexican, they miss the mark when it comes to flavor and quality. It's not a good sign when practically the only people eating in your \"Mexican\" restaurant are of the Caucasian persuasion. I'll stick with Baja Joes and even Serranos a block down."}
{"text":"A tasty island in a sea of mediocrity.  The East Valley isn't known for dining excellence so a place like Tia Rosa's is cherished.

I usually dine at the Taqueria as it has my favorite tacos at a cheaper price then the restaurant.  The salmon taco and seafood enchiladas are superb and virtually unrivaled in all of Phoenix.

The restaurant is good although it is typically loud and could stand to lose a few dozen decorations.  The place is so laden with every kind of Mexican curio and keepsake that it crosses good taste and sets up shop in the land of kitsch.

Think of it as the Barrio Cafe for the suburbs."}
{"text":"Whether it is eating dinner at the sit down restaurant or getting food to take home, the food at Tia Rosa's is pretty darn good!

My personal favorite is getting take out from the little shack across the parking lot. There chicken Chimi is really delicious and very filling! Their beans are really good, and it is hard to please me with beans. The Chimi comes with guacamole, sour cream and salsa. All make great complements to the Chimi.

Their salsa are pretty tasty, they aren't that spicy, but other than that I love getting their Chips and salsa when I take my Chimi to go. 

When I'm in the area I am always happy to stop by Tia Rosa's!"}
{"text":"Excellent salsa and chips, good drinks.... I've always been happy with the food I've ordered here, juicy meats and very generous portions.

One of the best things (imho) is that they serve Coke Zero. At a lot of restaurants it is either Coke or Diet Coke. 

Love the back patio area, very protected from the busy street nearby."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very cool and great for children and couples alike. The meals were prompt and the food was absolutely amazing. Hands down the best Mexican food in the valley. The server however seemed overwhelmed and at one point left us unattended for about 20 minutes. Over all the experience was great. Pricing was slightly high but for what you get it was well worth it."}
{"text":"It's out of the ordinary Mexican food, but darn tasty!  Service seemed a bit rushed when there wasn't much of a crowd.  It's not a place I would drive out of my way for, but if I'm in the area and craving gourmet Mexican, it's solid!"}
{"text":"So today is my first visit to this place.  My boss took the whole group here, with much hype about the food.  Overall the place was OK.  Had some pluses and some minuses.  I'm thinking I will come here one more time and try something else before I decide if I should make this a regular spot, or relegate it to \"yeah, I've been there\" status.

I was surprised to see chicken mole on the menu.  A very traditional dish that most places don't serve.  Normally I order a chimi when trying out a new place, but I made an exception here and ordered the mole.

The rice was very ordinary.  Not bad, but I can't really say I liked it either.  Plain white rice would have been as good or better.   The chicken mole was very flavorful. It was very intense, and good.  I believe it when they say \"22 herbs and spices\".  I enjoyed it.  The tortillas that accompany the mole started out good (warm, soft), but they cooled pretty quickly and became rather brittle.  Kind of annoying.  

And there was a long wait for food.  Nearly an hour after we ordered."}
{"text":"Tia Rosa used to be the best Mexican food ever until the original place burnt down.  The new place doesn't feel the same and the food doesn't taste the same.  Maybe atmosphere helps the food taste better?  It seems like the same as a lot of other Mexican restaurants now."}
{"text":"We have a new favorite Mexican restaurant... 

Rancho De Tia Rosa was packed by 6:30 on Saturday night.  We called ahead (no reservations for groups less than 10) and had to wait about 5 minutes before we were seated.

Then came the red and green salsa with chips.  At first taste, after hearing all the yelp love for this stuff, I thought it was good but didn't see the hype.  Next thing I knew I had ordered a total of three extra salas.. both red and green.  This stuff is amazing!

The red salsa was fresh and not spicy at all, but was perfect for both dipping and topping off my beef carne asada fajitas. 

The green salsa was sweet, but not too sweet and had an intoxication about it that made me continue to eat it long after I was full.

We tried the taco sampler (carnitas, beef, chicken).  All three were very good, but we were practically fighting over the carnitas and beef.  While the chicken was very good and clearly fresh, the carnitas and beef were too good to ignore.  Make sure you squeeze the lime on your carnitas.

I had the beef carne asada (mexico city fajitas) w/ roasted vegetables, rice and beans.  Everything was perfectly cooked and had a delicate roasted taste to it that put each item over the top.  It seemed literally everything was freshly cooked over an open flame by someone who clearly took pride in what they were doing.

The way they slow cook the meat for 10 hours and then grill over an open flame combines for a taste sensation that can't be missed.  The meat is among the most tender and was probably of a good cut.  You wouldn't know because it was perfectly seasoned and melted in your mouth.

My wife had the beef chimichanga which also was delicious.  The chimi was perfectly cooked fresh and not greasy.

We finished our meal off with the fried ice cream with strawberries.  This is a must try!  All the ingredients perfectly meshed together and the strawberries put it over the top.

Only negative of the night was our 'chips and salsa boy', who we coined \"Slammy Sosa\" because he angrily slammed down our salsas.

We think it was because he forgot to bring them a few minutes earlier.  This kid seemed to hate his life and became clearly disgusted when I asked for a green salsa (he only brought the red, come on dude!!).  We laughed about his nickname for the duration of the meal, so it wasn't a big deal.... but he almost cost this place a star.

Oh and I would definitely recommend this place for kids.  It was very loud because it was packed, so you don't have to worry about that.  Also they had the BEST balloon artist we'd ever seen.  He was very loud and funny.  The kids loved him.  He made some of the most amazing things from balloons, including a basketball hoop hat"}
{"text":"Decent, over priced. Service constant but hurried. Not sure what part of Mexico these people are from , but food needed some tweeks."}
{"text":"My husband wanted to eat Mexican food for dinner and I found this place in an AD somewhere. Check them out on Yelp too and ratings were good.  We love everything about this place inside and outside especially their beautiful flowers outside their building in the waiting area.  The food was delicious and price was reasonable.  We'll definitely come back to this place"}
{"text":"We used to live by the location on McKellips, but recently discovered this location. I love this place! I have been there now 3 times for dinner. Even on a busy Friday night, we've been able to get in and have good service. The food is great, the portions are big and the beer is cold. The ambiance is nice, too. The green sauce on the burritos is delicious. The cheesy dip with jalapenos is yummy, too. I have only eaten inside, but there's a nice patio, too. Grab some friends and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Incredible happy hour prices!   The only down fall is it's hard to decide on just a few items to eat.    They have the most tender and flavorful chicken."}
{"text":"Their breakfast is amazing. I ordered the biscuits and gravy. Especially love the customer service and the decorative environment!"}
{"text":"I like to find my Mesa just so that I have an excuse to eat at Tia Rosa's, especially during the Halloween season! This festive restaurant goes all out for the Halloween seasons and is decorated head to toe with festiveness! We visited on Friday night and thought that there would be a wait due to the number of cars in the parking lot, but because it's such a big restaurant, we were seated right away! 

I enjoy sitting on one of their patios (especially the back patio) because they are charming and intimate. They have a long list of margaritas but I especially like their pineapple one because it comes with a slice of pineapple! Their stuffed quesadillas aren't your average cheese stuffed tortilla and instead are oozing with yummy ingredients."}
{"text":"We went here last night with some friends that love this place. I am a big time Mexican food snob. I like mine authentic and spicy. This place is anything but authentic. Let's start with the salsa, the red salsa was about the only good thing therg, the green salsa was sweet, I can see some salsas being a litte sweet but this stuff was sickly sweet, not so good. Then I ordered the chimichanga with green chile pork. The fried tortilla was the only good thing on my plate. The meat inside was super dry and again it was sweet, not a good thing in my eyes. If I want sweet food I would have some cake or some St. Louis BBQ. I don't even think it was the green chile pork. The beans had too much of a smoky flavor, I could see if it was more of a smoky bacon or pork flavor but it didn't. 

The only good thing that night was the waiter. He was great. If you want great Mexican food this is not the place, go to someplace like Los Taquitos"}
{"text":"So the server asks \"how is everything?\"

Brief pause, then I chuckle. 

Trying to hold back my elation, I respond with simply \"this is Rancho de Tia Rosa, isn't it?\"

He stares back in confusion and says \"yes?\"

I reply \"exactly....\"

I then donned my sun blocking spectacles and headed towards the door. I exited the building letting out one last guttural  mariachi cry of satisfaction....AHHHAHAHAHYEEEE! 

I then made my way to the parking lot where I rode off in my trusty Bavarian steed yelling \"Rancho de Tia Rosa, I shall return!\" 

Best Mexican food on Earth! And Fransisco is my new favorite super hero.

Thanks Fransisco!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. We eat here often. Their chicken chimichanga is especially good. Good selection of margaritas. They do get very busy after about 5-6 pm and there is often a wait, but it's a nice place to have some good Mexican food."}
{"text":"With our kids coming down for spring break my wife and I have been on the hunt to find some cool places with great food, well let me tell you we felt like we hit the jackpot with Tia Rosa's.  First off if any of you are into Keto (low carb), they offer a low carb style platter.  We ordered ours with all three meats, carne asada, chicken and pork served with lettuce wraps, grilled vegetables, sour cream and cheese... assemble away! 

The decor inside and out is very well done and lends itself to great photos!"}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch yesterday and was pleasantly surprised by how good the cantina fish taco's were, they were tiny (which is how I like to eat) and full of flavor. Good service and nice atmosphere. Will definitely be returning for lunch more often."}
{"text":"Missed a great Brkfst because the phone was always busy maybe off the hook? Then between 10:30-11:00 very limited menu"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere.  There is a reason this place is always crowded.  Their seafood dishes are my favorite.  Grilled salmon enchiladas is as good a dish as I have had anyhere in the country.  One small thing....I do wish they had salt shakers on the tables, have to request each time."}
{"text":"Best mexican in america, PERIOD!  Worth a trip to Arizona to eat this stuff.

This was the only time that I ate my meal and then rudely ate the scraps off the four plates that my friends had left unfinished.  I don't care if they used MSG or Lard to make it so delicious...this is exactly what I would have ordered if Jesus had invited me to the Last Supper."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful it is decorated from floor to ceiling with beautiful Mexican art. The customer service is very good and the food was good."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Absolutely Amazing!!!

Probably the best Mexican food I have had in a long time! This place is right off Guadalupe and Higley, Which is south of the US 60. 

I few colleges and I decided to give this place a try, because one of us found it on Google maps when we were searching for near by places to get lunch. 

This building has a really cool theme and design. Right when I walked in a could tell it would be a great experience. The restaurant is pretty large on the inside with vaulted ceiling, and a nice layout. 

During Lunch hours they offer a lunch menu, when I ordered from. I ordered a beef burrito with red enchilada sauce. The meal comes with rice and beans. The deal was prepared very well. The beef was very tender and juicy, The  service here was very good, and professional.

I think next time I come here I want to try the chicken burrito instead of the beef."}
{"text":"This is one of the few mexican food places that I will eat at. The chimis are great. Thats basically what I always get. The place seems to be always packed with old Mesa people and snowbirds. The atmosphere is fun and the chips and salsa are good, not the best, but respectable. I rarely go anymore since the discovery of  Cantina Laredo and Cravings Gecko Grill. But still worth going if in the area."}
{"text":"Under new management!!!  
Many locals are aware of the tragic demise of the Sirrine family's Rosa's restaurant conglomerate.  I grew up on the food and eating a shrimp taco is always on my list of MUST DO when visiting home.  I was concerned that the new owner might change the recipes a little- it is rumored to have happened at Hacienda de Tia Rosa in Tempe- but nope!  I got my pineapple salsa and shrimp fix.  Taste was spot on.
Also tried my daughter's beef tacos.  The citrus marinated meat was just as tender-tasty as always.
Great decor, nice servers.  Corey, the new owner, gave us a discount because we brought a coupon that was not current.  
The salsas and chips are not typical tasting but yummy.  The only thing I Really Don't Like are the beans and rice.  Same recipe- I never have liked them!  They could experiment a little there."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, very fresh.  I had fajitas and they cam to the table very hot.  Service was wonderful."}
{"text":"We love the food here, the atmosphere is great and the wait staff is attentive and good at what they do. However, I had my husband's surprise birthday party there a few weeks ago and I was a little disappointed in what I got vs. what I was told. I made the reservations about 3 weeks in advance for about 20 people and asked if I could order appetizers and pitchers of margaritas instead of doing a sit-down dinner type party. The girl who took the reservation said that was fine and that I could order from the \"happy hour menu\" for the appetizers. I thought that was great and made the reservation.

 I called back about a week later to ask about the happy hour menu items and was transferred to Ryan, one of the managers. He gave me the break down of the happy hour menu, and I again confirmed with him that the reservation was in place and I could order from the happy hour menu. He said yes everything was in order and I could order from the happy hour menu. 

Again, 3 days before the big day, I was contacted by Ryan to confirm the reservation, I asked again about the happy hour menu and even asked about putting in the order ahead of time. He said I could just give my order to our server when we arrived. So I wrote down everything I wanted to order, even writing on the paper at the top \"FROM THE HAPPY HOUR MENU\" and wrote down how many of each item I wanted to order and gave it directly to the owner of the restaurant, not our server. 

 Everything went fine, the food was great, service was great......then the bill came! Holy Crap! It was about $120.00 more than what it should have been. When I asked our server about it, he checked with Ryan who said that he thought I had been told by the owner that it would be ok to order from the happy hour menu, but that she told him to ring up everything at the regular menu price! When I asked to speak with her, I was told she had just left for the evening. Really? If she had a problem with me ordering from the happy hour menu why didn't she say something about it when I handed her the paper and she was looking it over?  I have to say that Ryan did adjust the ticket somewhat by giving me a 10% discount, but all I wanted was for them to stand behind what they repeatedly promised me. Don't know that I will be going back there again. They really should stand by their word. Major disappointment!"}
{"text":"Update - I had to reduce it to 2 stars.  I would never voluntarily go here and that is a pretty good test for me.  I would return to most of my three star reviews.

I have had a mental debate whether to give this place two stars or three.  For fear of getting flamed, I bumped up my 2.5 to 3.  I guess the main thing is that I just don't get this place.  We went for the early bird service at 5pm because we had a big group and it was tough to find parking.  People were already flowing out the front door waiting for tables.  My in-laws think Tia's has the best food, but my inclination is that Mesa just needs some more restaurants.

The chips are good and the salsa is average.  I don't really like it when salsa tastes like enchilada sauce and this is borderline.  I have been here 3 or 4 times and the only time I thought my meal was good to very good was the time I ordered fish tacos even though I usually do not like fruit in my Mexican food.  Due to the fact that everyone seems to love the food, I keep trying new things but am usually sorely disappointed.  This time, I had average tortilla soup and an average mini shrimp quesadilla (which was served open faced, unlike most quesadillas and sweet).  I guess I will stick to the fish tacos or try Andrew's suggestion of carne asada next time the in-laws want to hit up Tia Rosas."}
{"text":"It's different, sweet salsa and smoke flavor to the meat and beans.. two stars for presentation."}
{"text":"I wish I could give my opinion on the food but unfortunately we never made it past the chips. It was a slow Tuesday night and there were only a few people in the restaurant. We never had a server come to our table. Waited 15 mins and nothing??? We did get chips, which were from a bag and not fresh. The salsa was also not very stellar. We walked out without an acknowledgement from anyone  Never going back"}
{"text":"The food wasn't that great.  I ordered papas con carne, the pork was pretty dry.  I guess I didn't read the menu description because when I think of \"papas\" I think chunks of potatoes but Tia Rosa serves pureed potatoes.  The flour tortillas were the highlight of the meal, I asked if they made them but they buy them from a distributor.  I used the tortillas to scoop up the meat and topped it with the potato mixture to cure the dry meat.  It was definitely something I had never had before.

The margaritas were excellent and the bartender was awesome."}
{"text":"You'd think that in a state like Arizona that you could throw a rock 10 feet and find great Mexican food. This is NOT true unfortunately. I've been searching for truly great Mexican food for two years and Ive finally found it!  Not only is the food fantastic but the ambiance can't be beat. The patio is gorgeous, and there are several different rooms and each has it's own look and feel. If you don't want to sit in you can get take out. There's a separate building in the parking lot that handles only carry out orders.  It's not the cheapest place but it's worth every penny"}
{"text":"So I have never been to Arizona before, and on my second night there, we had dinner at Tia Rosa. It's a charming restaurant with really quaint decor; they had their Christmas decorations up which added to the cozy atmosphere. The place was bustling even though it was a weekday so I assume hat it gets busy often

I had ancho peach glazed chicken. The chicken was very tender and the sauce was delicious! The side of corn was also really tasty. I am currently trying to recreate this dish at home because it's sooo good and I am a gazillion miles away /sigh. If you don't know what to get, try this!

The boyfriend had the chicken mole, which was also really good and his regular dish whenever he is in town visiting his folks. 

Add horchata and you'll be good to go."}
{"text":"Although not the worst thing imaginable, it is definitely not authentic by any stretch of the imagination. After years of living in southern California and having true Mexican food with neighbors and friends that had barely been in country for less than 6 months, this food left a ton to be desired. The chips and salsa left a good bit to be desired... the chips being paper thin and tasting like the aforementioned paper, and the salsa tasting like something from a glass jar, not a good start. Ordered their equivalent of Fajitas and I asked for extra onions, just to be told that in order to get onions, I'd have to pay an extra $5 for a skewer of peppers and onions... I simply wanted onions and was told that wasn't an option without paying that much extra. Give me an onion and I'll give you a dollar, I'll cut the thing myself. Jeez

The food shows up after about 10 minutes or so and it isn't anything remotely close to Mexican food. Carne Asada... no, it isn't. It's simply steak with salt and pepper. No flavor to it outside of the meat itself, which was a bit too fatty on top of it. The chicken, dry as can be, though the flavoring on the outside wasn't terrible, but by no means did it taste like Mexican style chicken in any fashion. Pork, terrible... dry and boring. Entirely too bland to be anything worthwhile. Moving on to the sour cream and guac that came with it, nothing special to the guac, simple avocado flavor with nothing else, sour cream was just fine. Refried beans weren't anything special, they came from a can, that much was obvious as it's the same flavor I've gotten from the cheap refried beans in the supermarket. Rice was okay at best, but nothing that made it stand out.

The food added insult to injury... All of that was after waiting an hour to get a seat. In this time, we had watched at least 6 groups that came after us get seated before we did. Their hand written list of names was proof of that as the black sharpie they used to cross out names had lines all over the paper with uncrossed lines that hadn't been seated. They favored larger parties on top of everything else. Watching a family of six get brought to their table a mere 10 minutes after arriving, and yet we'd been there for a half hour at that point, that was just a sign of things to come.

No reason for 2 stars except that they served food that you could digest, or at least something resembling it."}
{"text":"This my 3 time back to Tia Rosa I am liking this place! The food is out of this world delicious! The expansive list of margaritas is as delicious as the food selections! 

And the service has always been attentive, flexible, and upbeat! You should not go wrong in this place. The only thing to worry is how busy this can get so get there early."}
{"text":"We love Tia's in Mesa but since we move away. This one is closer. Really happy with the food. Got the sampler mini chimis. They were amazing. Then I tried the ancho peach chicken (to try something new). It has great flavor. Great change to my normal chicken chimichanga. Great service too."}
{"text":"Tia Rosas is under new management and ownership.  It's just not quite the same.  The food, the service...

We arrived as soon as it opened and were not greeted at the desk, even though we were the only ones there!  Our serve was not very attentive.

We were served chips from the day before.  They weren't fresh or warm which was a big disappointment.  Please make fresh chips!!!  The salsa was good, thank goodness or we might have left.

I adore the mango chicken salad but ordering it this time was so different than before.  There was very little mangos and the Chutney was almost non existent.  It was a huge disappointment.  My daughter's toquitos were dry and over cooked, almost as if they weren't fresh either.

I hope they figure things out because we've long been loyal customers and hope to continue to be.  But not unless this is resolved."}
{"text":"The hostess was super friendly. The chips and salsa came and the red and green were terrible, like they poured sugar in it to the point of unbearable. We asked for hotter salsa and it tasted like ketchup and hot sauce out of a bottle. Our family lives chips and salsa and it was left almost untouched. Lunch came, not impressive. We had the red tamales, and tasted like they added vinegar. This is definitely not a good Mexican food restaurant. The waiter only cared about how he thought we should feel about things. Never going back"}
{"text":"The location is nice and decent atmosphere. Great place to do the people watching thing, ha! The food is o.k., not great and not bad!! It gets pretty crowded on Friday or saturday night. They have a convenient window to do your take-out orders in the other building."}
{"text":"Just one word...CRAP!!!!! Canned Enchilada Sauce( you can tell because it had that tin taste) and the service sucked and the manager could not care less. All he did was water the plants outside. It took them 20 minutes for the server to come to our table, and it was not busy. He had 2 tables outside and 4 tables inside. its called STATIONS!!!! Someone needs to head back to restaurant management school. Never Again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!  Lynn W and I had a late lunch here after watching a Fall league baseball game at HoHoKam.  I've been wanting to stop in forever, especially since it's so close to home.

I had the Carne Asada plate (fajitas, although nothing like any fajitas I've ever had) and it was awesome.  The meat was marinated and char grilled, so tender and so so tasty.  I loved that the peppers and onions were also char grilled, no grease puddle like other places.  The rice was flavorful and beans were some of the best I've ever had.  

I had the raspberry margarita and it was so very good.  

I'll definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to a tia Rosas in years and I am glad I decided to come back. Service was okay (by no means bad, just a little less attentive than I would have liked) and the food was excellent. Good mexican food at a good price point...would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This food is the only good redeeming quality of this restaurant. Whenever we come we know that it will be a long wait between visits from the server. Without fail we experience the same lack luster poor service from multiple different servers. Having been a server myself I understand the service being slow if it's busy, but even when it's dead I watch the servers aimlessly wander at times between visiting tables."}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen times and have only had the seafood enchiladas.  They are that good.  Plenty of shrimp and fish served with a creamy green enchilada sauce.  The grilled red and green peppers and rice round out the dish.

Plenty of chips and salsa and speedy refills on the iced tea."}
{"text":"Under new ownership and some things have changed and some remain the same. I think they raised the price of kid meals. Lame. Food and flavors seem the same. Service is horrible. After being seated, we waited 15 minutes for water/drinks. Had to remind them on several occasions about chips. Food came out in a timely manner. After we finished eating, our bill took 10 minutes to come out. We immediately handed them our payment and after another 10 minutes, we had to ask where our bill was. A few minutes later it was brought out. 20+ minutes to pay the bill is way too long. They also had a parrot on their patio eating off of dishes and bother table. Kinda gross. It's was around 2:00pm so they weren't that busy."}
{"text":"My family went to Rancho de Tia Rosa on a Saturday night and boy did we enjoy ourselves.  Our group of 8, including 2 kids, enjoyed our food thoroughly.  The music and the balloon guy were added pluses.  In fact, even the adults were entranced by what the guy could do with balloons.

The menu had many vegetarian and gluten free options and my pork chop was delicious.  Even the corn side dish was some of the best I have ever had.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, delicious and filling food, great atmosphere. 

Just wanted to let management know what a hospitable and caring staff you have. After great service, my toddler spilled his chocolate milk under the table and my husband and I felt bad so I saw the bus boy clearing tables and I walked over with a few bucks for his inconvenience. He smiled, shook his head and declined my offer. 

Walking away feeling like true guests makes dining at this establishment a real treat!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a good Mexican Restaurant to go to near by... however, it turned out to be bland food and very overpriced.  ALSO, DO NOT GO HERE FOR A GOOD MARGARITA, they are NOT worth the price tag!  I really wanted to LOVE this place, but my family and I spent a lot of money on a family night out here and were severely disappointed.  Hopefully others have a better experience, or at least some tequila in their 10.00 drink.  Also, they nickel and dime'd us to death."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican Restaurant in the world.  

This is about as classy as you can get in East Mesa (I know, not a lot of competition in that category).  They've finished the new location and came out with a whole slew of new recipes.  My favorites include the flying saucer or the chicken mango salad.  I've set a goal to try something new each time I go here and haven't been dissappointed with the new menu items yet.  A bit pricey but with the new decor comes a new price tag.

There's a nice take-out addition too for the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Order the flying saucer or mango salad.  Both are delicious."}
{"text":"Definitley not one of the best restaurants I've been too. I wasn't very impressed with the menu and was frustrated that they advertised baja food when it wasn't really baja.  A lot of the dishes also have fruit in them and I'm honestly not a fan of strawberries in my mexican food. Valle de Luna or Zocalo are the best mexican restaurants in town. The only thing good about Tia Rosa was the tequila."}
{"text":"My family likes to meet here.  I've yet to have a meal I really even liked here.  The service was fine but I just don't ever really leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Great place!  Fresh Mexican food and decent prices.  Family owned..Try the Chili Relleno, ITS THE BEST!  Finished with pine nuts!  Family really likes this place, especially the cantina next door for better prices and no wait."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in Gilbert. They have a wide menu, from the typical meals to specialty dishes. The decor is adorable."}
{"text":"Owners Dennis and Liz Sirrine are old-time friends of my parents. Not good enough friends that I get free food I must add. But it's great to see folks I know do so well. The little labor of love that was their first restaurant -- the famed Rosas --  has evolved into the fabulous Rancho de Tia Rosas.

\"Where Mexican Food is a Work of Art\" claims Tia Rosa.  The Enchiladas Monterey with it's vibrant colors of the Mexican flag could be a Piccasso and the slightly-sweet, nutty Chicken Mole might be a Van Gogh. Thank goodness this art is edible!

There is a take out store in front and an amazing patio. Try to visit soon before it gets too hot to sit outside, and come early or make reservations; it's almost always packed."}
{"text":"The back patio is lovely in the Fall/Winter...my favorite is the mole!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked I forgot to write a review on this place. Excellent, innovative mexican food. The margaritas are amazing and there are so many to chose from! Wonderful salsa's, crispy chips; the total package. Tia Rosa's had become a staple when I lived in AZ, I'd go with my parents, my friends, anyone. Vegetarians can rely on their black beans and most waiters will let you customize your order (I've had black bean tacos before, delish!). This is fresh, smokey and smart mexican food, something new from all those chains. Beware the large parties with several kids, is it located in Mesa after all."}
{"text":"YIKES! I demoted them to 2 stars. Why?!

The food, plain and simple. It really isn't Rosa's on University. I had been running errands all day last Saturday and I ended up at Bark Avenue Pet Supply, right next door to Tia Rosa's.

I remembered thinking it was ok the last time so I thought, why not? I couldn't afford to be picky as my cousin and I were having a bad low blood sugar moment...I knew it was bad because I started to have the shakes -- anyway...sorry...I am digressing.

There weren't that many people there, so that was a good thing. Service was wonderful. The chips and salsa revived us, as did the iced tea.

I decided to splurge and get the chimichanga instead of the salad I would have normally ordered. BIIIG mistake. One of the things I liked about Rosa's on University is that their chicken chimichangas are flavorful - the chicken is always spiced right and it's never dry.

I truly wish I could have said the same about this one. I was so angry with it that I ended up just yanking the chicken out (they put beans inside the chimichanga instead of it being straight chicken -- yuck) and eating the deep fried shell. The salad on the plate was going bad - it was brown and slimey.

My cousin wasn't thrilled with her burrito and the refried beans in general just had zero flavor. I can't believe that these 2 restaurants are the same ones operating off the exact recipes. Tia Rosa's has gone dreadfully wrong somewhere and I can't quite put my finger on it.

The atmosphere is still cute and the bathrooms are always wonderfully clean, but the food...the food...PISSES ME OFF. IF I PAY THAT MUCH FOR IT I EXPECT IT TO BE GOOD.

The appearance of the place forces me to give it 2 stars because it really is adorable. Now if only the food had some flavor and consistency from the original Rosa's on University.

I refuse to go back there -- even if someone else is paying."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to have dinner tonight. Glad we did  our dinner was good, one of the best margaritas I have had and the staff was amazing! We will be back! Our server was awesome and the hostess made sure we had a booth since our 2 year old decided to fall asleep on the way there. Great place!"}
{"text":"AWESOME Mexican food. And even more amazing service!

This place is super huge, so we naturally assumed we would be cramped and have to wait hours for our food. Not so! The tables are arranged in a manner where you are able to see everyone in the area, but are given enough space that you feel as if you are in your own private area. The waitress took our order in 3 minutes and we were seated within 10 minutes. Amazing. It was a pretty crowded night too, the parking situation is a little tough when the lot is full. We had to park in the back, unpaved area, at the very end spot next to the ditch. Service continued on with greatness, water refills without asking- she even brought us lemons for our water :). I like.

The food was amazingly delicious. Dare I say the best Mexican food I have had outside of homemade cooking. And I love Mexican food. The cheese enchiladas (my Mexican staple) were fabulous. You could smell the fresh corn tortilla, the cheese was not overly stringy and there was the perfect amount of sauce. The rice was also tasty and not dry. The chips and salsa were super great too. Sigh* I want some right now. I hope to get to venture here more often!! BF had the chile relleno. He states \"the pork filling made the whole dish very fulfilling
im usually still hungry after eating a regular chilli relleno with just cheese.\"

Yummilicious Factor = A++"}
{"text":"Richelle was amazing. The food is terrific. Her recommendation of the chili relleno was spot on. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is where its at!
Monday through Saturday from 2PM to 5PM their Happy Hour, thats when you need to try this place.
The restaurant itself looks great, outside and inside, the service is... slow and the food and drinks are your average Mexican type of stuff you come to expect in AZ. With all that said, you can't beat their Happy Hour prices on the Margaritas, Burritos and Tacos!"}
{"text":"Now I've been to Tia Rosa several times and I've always enjoyed the food and Margaritas.  I specifically love the grilled peppers and onions you receive with some dishes.  That said, last time I was there, I ordered a Vegetarian Burro ($12....which is already quite a lot for a Burro filled with beans), and asked to have some grilled peppers and onions put inside, instead of cheese....and then the grilled peppers and onions on the side instead of the beans and rice.  My burro ended up costing $18!  $3 extra for each addition of the grilled veggies.  I could have got a better tasting burrito at Chipotle...actually 3 veggie burritos at Chipotle for $18...and those come with peppers and onions, and Guacamole!

When you spend $60 on Margaritas, and another $80 on food,  I would expect them to throw in a side of vegetables."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this place.  I reviewed the McKellips location a couple times....once a great review, and once a bad review.  Now, we've been to the Gilbert location a few times now on Saturday for happy hour, while my sons at his guitar lesson.  Their house margaritas are really good....and cheap during happy hour (3 or 4 bucks I think).  Their chips and green salsa are also very good....but you have to pay for them in the bar...at least during happy hour.  Had the nachos once, but realized the beans aren't vegetarian so I won't be having them again.  I'm sure we'll go again for happy hour, but that's probably about it.

One thing I absolutely love is the decor!  So cute and charming!  Love it!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location plenty of times and the service has always been amazing! My previous visit  was this past week and it was wonderful! Our waitress Cinthia greeted us with the happiest attitude and brought out our drinks and appetizers in a quick and timely manner, all while maintaining every other table she had. Overall our food was delicious and we'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"My 85 year old grandpa is one of the greatest foodies i know... and it is from him that i get my love for food. I have heard this story of his about finding a little Italian place is Vienna a dozen times and every time the story gets better. I promise this all ties into my review.

I took my grandparents to Tia Rosa or Racho De Tia Rosa if you don't live in Mesa, last week, while they were in town on their way to Norway. 

There were 9 of us so we dined in the large room and it was loud. However, they were true to their word and had us seated 5 min after we arrived and 30 min after i called in... this on a FRIDAY! If weather and party size permit i recommend sitting outside, less noise and more relaxing.

I had the chicken mole... the flavor was brilliant but it was a little too spicy, which is a bad combo because i couldn't spot eating and kept sweating and getting the hiccups. I recommend the fish tacos and don't waste your time on the salmon, go straight for two shrimp. 

My Grandpa's review of Tia Rosa's: It was worth going just of the Mango Lemonade."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best MEXICAN restaurant in all of Mesa! There mango lemonade is so great and I can't get enough of their unique salsa :)"}
{"text":"This place is fast, but the food is not fast food quality at all. The portions are pretty big and the prices are reasonable. The re-fried beans at this place are epic. I actually heard they put butter in them. The only other beans that are this good are my sister's homemade ones. 

The parking is horrible, but that is because this place is busy all the time. 

I don't bother calling in a take out order because for my order the longest I have ever waited was 10 minutes, and the restaurant was packed. 

The chips are perfect too."}
{"text":"Went to Tia rosa's with my girlfriend for a meal.... Use to be my parents fav Mexican restaurant. Decided to check it out again. 30 min wait to sit in the restaurant so we sat at the bar which was wide open. Which was understandable because it was uncomfortable, small, no tv and 3 bartenders with a lack of personality and seemed as though they didn't like each other. I have bartended for years and certainly don't expect my bartender to entertain me, but it seemed as though we were being an inconveience to them by requesting to eat our meal at the bar. After asking for a bar towel to wipe off the filthy empty bar cause my arms were sticking to it, we ordered drinks and were immediatly served with a request to pay. We informed him that we had planned on eating as well and would like to run a tab. After retrieving menus and giving us silverware he walked away only to return 10 mins later questioning if we cared for chips and salsa? I was hesitant to say no because I felt as if he really didn't want to deliver them to us. Reminding myself that since I was paying him to serve us and we did go there because we were starving I accepted his offer, as well as ordering a cheese crisp as an appetizer. The cheese crisp came out on a large pizza tin with a small taco size cheese crisp for $5. I presumed they put it on a large pizza tin so the bartender didn't have to go out of his way and offer us appetizer plates. Not interested in using the pizza tin as a plate my gf snagged 2 dirty coffee saucers from the end of the bar so we could enjoy them. The salsa was delicous and our food was really good too. I ordered the fajitas and wasn't pleased with the 2 huge tortillas I had to stuff with only meat since they were lacking on the lettuce, pico de gallo, and cheese which i had to request and pay for on the side. The drinks were very week and people were bringing their drinks back to the bar to get more booze. I myself requested another shot of tequila for my margarita. I asked for a cheap shot of silver tequila and the bartender wasn't sure what to pour so he gave me an $8 shot in my $8 margarita. So basically I paid $16 for a weak margarita. 

The salsa was the best part of our meal, you would think with a restaurant full of cheap snow birds you would have thought a middle aged couple wanting to spend money at the bar running up a $60 tab you would think they would have shown a little bit of effort to accomodate us. 

Next time I will wait 30 minutes and hopefully get a server who would show a little appreciation for your business. If there is a next time."}
{"text":"I took my best friend out to lunch for her birthday, wrong place to go.The service was horrible and our waitress had the worst attitude. I ordered the shrimp tacos expecting nice juicy shrimp, and instead I received pre cooked small shrimps that had no flavor and were over done. The corn tortillas were soaked and fell apart the moment I tried to eat it.
I Complained to our waitress and she said I should have told her and that I already ate half of it. Which I didn't, it made me sick) instead you would think she would say, \"I'm sorry, I'll take care of that\" what was sad is that she never checked on us to see how our food was. The manager was only going to comp us half of the meal because I ate half. Really!!!

We asked to speak to her and explained the situation over and over. She finally comped my meal. I had to get the manager to check us out, because ours was being less than nice.
Really when all was said and done, the manager should've comped the whole meal!!!!
The worst food and customer service I've experienced."}
{"text":"Horrible... Service is bad and slow.. And food is not that good, for those that know real Mexican food. Won't go back"}
{"text":"Best mexican food in mesa by FAR!! I could eat it everyday!"}
{"text":"They weren't busy so the server was on the money! I tried the pulled pork fajitas and my girlfriend try the chicken fajitas. The veggies and tortillas were awesome but everything else kind of lacked flavor. The server brought out plenty of chips with three different kinds of salsa. They were unique but none really popped for me. We ordered some fried ice cream, a necessity at a Mexican restaurant, and after about 15 minutes the waitress informed us that they didn't have it. The manager offered to buy us desserts for the inconvenience, which was pretty awesome if u ask me. I had the key lime pie and the kids had the kids Sunday. I will have to try this place again and see if something else on the menu has some Zing."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food restaurant ever! Enchilada plates are the BEST!! Happy hour is amazing, the bar is great."}
{"text":"I didn't pay, so i can't comment on the pricing... but the food was good.  They did mess up most of our app/drink orders, though."}
{"text":"Salsa, refried beans, shrimp tacos - these are the items at Tia Rosa for which THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO COMPARISON!!!!!!!!!!! 

But something is amiss with the current situation. Simple solution cited below. Read on.

Actual Star Rating = 2. An additional Star added to represent my hopes and dreams.

Tia Rosa's used to be top notch in every aspect. In recent years the experience has lost some of its shine. And it seems on a continued trajectory to further dim. HOWEVER, a return to former GREATNESS is easily within reach if the new management wants it.

So give them a shot. I plan to. Personal commitment to myself though: I truly only have 1-2 visits left in me before I feel like an idiot for going back. I really hate it when one of my favorites goes into decline. Please don't let us down.

Signature aspects of the Tia Rosa's experience (that I hope return) are:
- Being greeted with a smile upon entering
- A warm, welcoming service attitude that makes the customer feel appreciated
- Vibrant flavors
- Leaving with a satisfied feeling of money well spent

Here's the thing. Impersonal, lack-luster service usually stems from poor leadership. Servers have bad days too. But when service becomes frequently lax and/or brusque, management style is frquently the root cause.

As mentioned in my opening line. There are 3 items on the TR menu that draw me in. Those flavors have been a bit muted over the past couple years of management/ownership turmoil. 

My wife likes the shredded beef. Her favorites items are their enchildas and cantina tacos. Even at in its hayday TR's shredded beef items really left me cold. The taste is odd to me. Like I said my wife likes it, but she likes me, so who knows what that lady is thinking. But she definitely agrees that today's fare pales in comparison to previous years. 

Recently I went out on a limb to find a beef menu item to enjoy. The fajitas come with their shredded beef, so that was out. I decided to order their \"Grilled Steak -Carne Asada Style\". I requested that they cut the steak fajita style in kitchen for me. They refused (in truth, that absolutely baffled me). I had to work a little harder for my make-shift beef fajitas. The Carne Asada came tough, dry, and difficult to cut with the flimsey knife they provided me. I tried folks, but they're not making it easy to keep a positive attitude, especially with regard to their beef game. 

I'll stick to my shrimp tacos, beans, green salsa, and habenero salsa. Might throw in a cheese crisp from time to time. Those are tasty too.

I could go on. I could wax nostalgic. But these guys need to turn it around to warrant that effort from me.

To Tia Rosa's ownership --

Simple solution to turn it ALL around: Put someone in your frontline leadership with a Passion for Excellence in SERVICE and QUALITY, someone who will establish a TEAM CULTURE through your kitchen and service staff. If you staff is inspired and feels appreciated they will natural make your clients feel apprecaited. If you already have that person in place, awesome... grow and encourage that person. That frontline role is the heart of your organization, everything is dependent on it."}

This is the place to go for phenomenal Mexican food in a cozy pueblo styled atmosphere =)"}
{"text":"Last night we had yet another terrible encounter with the head hostess/manager (older woman).  She is sooo rude to customers if you don't fit into her little box of rules.  There has got to be a better way to be polite and enforce policies!  We tried to sit on the front patio where we always sit (bc we try to avoid her at all costs) and she wouldn't let us.  She said no one could serve us out there, meanwhile 2 other tables were out front eating food and having drinks. 

I tried to have a bridesmaid party there one night, couldn't make reservations, and couldn't be seated until everyone was there.  We were planning on being there a few hours to chat and drink and it didn't matter.  She wanted us to know our friends food order that was going to be late to the party or we couldn't be seated.  Again I just avoided her and us girls sat in the bar and were served by the bar tender.  

She's so rude that you instantly just want to leave the restaurant and find somewhere else to go.  This location is losing business bc of this woman, I've left multiple times and so has a friend of mine that has the same opinion of her.  Maybe they are ok with treating customers rudely just so they can get as many people in and out of the door as possible but there has to be a better way."}
{"text":"Mesa suffers from a serious poverty of fun things to do and good places to eat, but before you start praying for daylight there is hope! If you're tired of soulless chain establishments and Mexican food that seems a little too authentic, but don't want to flee to Tempe or Phoenix Tia Rosa's is just what the foodie ordered.

Salmon Taco with Mango Salsa, need I say more? Yum - E!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I took my Mom and Daughter.  The place was packed to the gills but we only had about a 15 wait on the lovely patio.  I have never seen so many flowers!  The decor inside and out is really spectacular.  

My mom had the fish tacos and beans and Jennifer and I had pork chimichangas. My mom and I both started with delicious margaritas from the bar.  The portions were huge!  My chimichanga came smothered in guacamole and sour cream and served with rice and beans. Everything was delicious. All three of us loved the food.  The pork was tender and seasoned perfectly. 

Service was efficient and friendly, our waitress -- as I later found out -- is the cousin of a gal I used to work for. Proving that Mesa/Gilbert are small towns!  I highly recommend this restaurant and will for sure be back!  

I uploaded some photos of our meals."}
{"text":"Amazing cheese quesadillas, and the beans are a must try!!! The refried bean had a smoky bacon taste, and it was really hard to leave any behind. The chips and fundido was excellent. The lunch menu was super reasonable and very large. Only complaint was that service was a little slow."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome a lot to look at as far as decor goes, but the food was bland and service was slow. 

Granted the service was pretty good until a rude couple sat down next to us and immediately complained about the server. Which I am sure he heard because he never returned except to hand us the check. 

They give you chips and salsa when you sit down one red and one green both are surprisingly sweet."}
{"text":"Love Tia Rosas! I am not a fan of the beans because they taste a little too MJ like barbecue but I really enjoy the nachos and and enchiladas! Always so clean and the staff are so nice!"}
{"text":"Went here with some locals who love the place. Ordered the fish tacos by their suggestion and it was probably the best fish tacos I've ever had! I'd ask for an extra tortilla because they really put a lot on just one!"}
{"text":"First time there and it wasn't that great the appetizers and drinks are good but I had the cheese enchiladas and they tasted like right out of the can for the price they charge for their dinners it's not really worth it"}
{"text":"We had an abominable experience here and, although very close to home for us, vowed to never go back. Took my wife, two daughters, two grandchildren for a 'special' time. We have had decent food and service at this restaurant in the past. I was stuck with a 'tilty' table the entire time. Apparently it is rocket science to address this. The service was delivered as if there was a huge drug party going on in the back. No concept of getting orders out in any sensible order or entrees at the same time. Then there was the food quality. I know good food and I know bad and mediocre food. I seldom leave most of the served food on my plate. I did with this meal. Two of the other adults in our group also were not happy with what they were served. I made our dissatisfaction known to the waiter and basically they don't care. The food is pricey and the drinks are nothing special either. Just get the margarita mix at Costco and essentially you have the same thing. Surprisingly, this restaurant gets a lot of rave reviews. If you want a good Mexican meal with a Southwestern twist, try the Blue Agave."}
{"text":"third strike you are outta here my dinner arrived cold even the meat inside the enchilada was cold, only thing hot on my plate was the black beans. the salsa was very bland and the green was so sweet I could have drank it as tea.
this has been getting progressively worse each time I came here. Thought it might have been because it was Friday's, so I tried Tuesday around six it was worse than the last time and with the number of empty tables this may be another restaurant soon. you should have stayed in the old location."}

The waiter will ask you  for his tip upfront .as this will be the last time you see him. Women seem to be runners not wait staff. Bean were soured and the meet over cooked.
GEN REVIEW  OVER FOOD
OVER COOKED
OVER PRICED
OVER IT"}
{"text":"Came here in a large group and they were very kind and attentive which is where one of the stars comes from. The food is awful. Plain and simply awful. Calling this spot \"Mexican\" is misleading. At best they are Tex Mex and not even good Tex Mex (if such a thing exists). Everything from the salsa served with chips to the sauce on the enchiladas and glaze on the fish was sickly sweet. It's as if they swapped out their salt for sugar in every dish. The margarita was unfortunate. Maybe I'm spoiled with good Mexican food but this can barely be called edible. Thanks for having good servers. No gracias for the food."}
{"text":"I am rarely a tough critic when it comes to writing a review, and I am being very generous with my rating of three stars. Let's just say that food is food, and it did it's job for the hour I spent there. However, if you want authentic Mexican food, this is NOT the place. 
Where do I begin... the exterior of this place is very inviting and extremely authentic. You would assume that you're in for a treat. You walk inside to find the same authenticity of an atmosphere you would find in a Mexican restaurant too. But, this is all misleading. Unfortunately, the food lacked an authentic flavor. 
The red salsa that came with the chips had way to much oregano that overpowered any other flavors that should have been present, such as jalapeños/Serrano peppers, onions, garlic, tomatoes, etc.. The chips were also served with a green salsa that tasted as if the chef had spilled sugar in the recipe. Whoever left the review stating that the beans are the best thing since sliced bread, is seriously delusional. The beans were the worst part of the plate, please do not serve beans with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Tia Rosa must be shaking her head. As for the rice, you may as well be serving up some Zataran's boxed Mexican rice. I'll move onto my steak burrito served enchilada style. That was not steak but rather a beef roast, and once again the sauces are way to sweet. 
I can't even give the benefit of a doubt that the food would be considered Tex Mex, I've eaten better. I really expected a lot from this place after briefing over the 4 star rating. Sadly, I was disappointed. 
To name a few pros: 
Great atmosphere
Food was served hot
Great service 
Large portions"}

{"text":"Pretty far from home in old town Scottsdale but worth the trip out to Gilbert. The wait on Friday night at 730PM was 30-45 minutes which seemed a bit extreme for how big this place was. The margaritas were delicious & the food was awesome. I got the steak quesadilla, my boyfriend got the steak burro & our other two friends got a chicken burro. Big enough portions for 2 meals or to split with someone. Also reasonably prices, I think ours were $10-14 each."}

{"text":"Whether its gone downhill or just a bad day, not entirely sure, but from the looks of the other reviews, it looks like they are having a hard time. My husband and I went for lunch today and little did we know, we were heading into a very bad experience!
From the time we sat down to when someone came to take our drink order was quite some time. When he did come he told us right away that there were only 2 wait persons today(I never saw another one besides him).  At this time we placed our order and waited...and waited...and waited for our drinks, and it was only water. We finally had to ask again for water. As we waited for our food, we observed a couple leave and another table of unhappy customers that hadn't received their food. And we waited...and waited...and waited, probably around 30-40 minutes before ONE of our plates arrived, but the order was not exactly right so they took it back to make it right. When they brought it back, my husband was still waiting for his food...waiting, waiting, for probably another 20 minutes and it never came! We flagged the waiter down to tell him we were still waiting for my husbands food, but to just put it in a to go box. He said a flippant \"sorry\" and said \"it's probably plated already\" and left to the kitchen. After a bit, he came back and said \"we took care of it, we took it off\". 
So that was that, my husband just didn't get any food after we had been there for over an hour!
We had to make a stop at another place, on the way home, for my husband's lunch!
We used to love this place when it was over on Lindsey and McKellips, so we were very disappointed!!"}

{"text":"I am from out-of-state. I have to eat at Tia Rosa every time I visit. I love their refried beans. They are lard-free. I also love their nachos with the smoky beef. I don't eat cheese (and the only beef I EVER eat is at Tia Rosa), and they are always accommodating at making the nachos with no cheese or sour cream. We always take a bunch of children with us, and the employees are always so accommodating. They also have delicious chips and salsa! Anything you order there will be amazing. I am semi-vegan (I break the rules for their AMAZING beef) and there are plenty of options for me."}

{"text":"One word to describe this place.. HORRIBLE!  I do not write reviews unless I have experienced the place at least twice.  The first time was a year ago, based off reviews that gave this place four and half stars.  My first experience, horrible food and horrible service (a server passing by the back of the chair my Dad was sitting in  pushed it in with his hip in order to squeeze between my Dad's chair and another's chair, instead of saying \"excuse me\" or \"I apologize\"  he just ignored my Dad's negative reaction).  Not to mention it seemed they had not dusted the place since the built the building.  Nasty!  My second experience came as part of a dinner with friends who invited me.  Again, food horrible and service has not improved.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place at all."}
{"text":"I was hoping the new ownership would bring a newer, more efficiently run restaurant, but that was far from the case. They open at 11am on Saturday's....I know this because that's when I went in to have an early lunch. We were the first table sat outside on their mosquito infested patio. I saw one other table inside with a older couple at it. We ordered drinks, and then quickly ordered our food because we were hungry. 45 minutes later, empty water glass in front of me and still no food. Waitress declares she is doing everything she can but one of the steak entrees takes a long time. I wait 15 more minutes, making my total time at this restaurant 1 hour and 18 minutes. I finally had to get up and walk out because I had prior engagements to be some where and never imagined a simple lunch taking this long. So, NO LUNCH! Unreal how disappointed I was in the wait for food, as well as the lack of eagerness to earn back my business when I was leaving and let them know to cancel my food. Never again."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The service was wonderful. We had a group of ~40 people and the we servers worked hard for us. 
Now, I like spicy food and their menu is NOT  spicy at all. Rather it is sweet. Even the salsa. So while very good, it was a different taste, hence 4 vs 5 stars. However, when back in town I will go back as I think it would warmup to the different, more Mexico City style food. I recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best Mexican food in the valley. They have been around for quite some time but recently downsized to the one location in gilbert, off of higly and guadalupe. I always get the machaca beef chimichanga with sour cream and guac. I can recommend the fish tacos as well, very good. The service was friendly and prompt. It seems like they got a great system over there. Very busy on weekend nights so beat the rush! Good thing is they have plenty of outdoor seating so that helps get you in a little quicker."}
{"text":"This place is my absolute FAVORITE. The food is fantastic the wait staff is super attentive and nice and the margs are large and strong. A+++"}
{"text":"New management, same delicious food, if not better. The green salsa should come to the table in a gallon pitcher. It's that good! I get the carne Asada mixed meat plate and always have extra to bring home. The beans and bean dip are smoky and addicting, and I dream about the shrimp tacos with mango salsa."}
{"text":"Great place! Victoria the hostess was so sweet and upbeat. We just loved her. Our server was Cynthia and she was awesome. Quick and efficient. The food was delicious and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in the valley. My personal favorites are the carne asada plate and the Baja style seafood tacos (get the shrimp and crab). Also, make sure to ask your server for the \"spicy picante\" salsa. It is only available on request and is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Food is good if you're expecting something tastier than cat litter. On the bright side, the bar area is legit and the bartenders are on their game. Ask for Frank and he'll pour you a good one. Would I go back? Only if I wanted to get white girl wasted."}
{"text":"My husband and I had eaten here once before with our family about a year ago. My husband said he really wanted to eat here again. Even though I did not really care for the food last time I said okay. We sat in the main dining area which is very pretty. It has a fountain and there is a lot to look at. We order two appetizers to share. We ordered a cheese crisp and a sampler appetizer. The sampler appetizer was pretty bad. They give you a fried bean burrito which has way too much cheese, a nasty meatless tamale which tasted like dirt, a tostada which hardly had any beans, and these little taquitos which were the highlight of the meal. I will not ever come back here. By the way, my husband was disappointed with the food as well. I gave it two stars because of the decor and our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican restaurant I've been to in Arizona. The one in Mesa has a nicer outside seating area with a big tree in the middle, but the inside looks exactly the same. Consistently great food, and even better margaritas. The salsas are very good too, and the wait staff is friendly."}
{"text":"It's ok. Their salsas all taste like sugar was put into them. Very sweet. Even the extra spicy salsa is sweet. I ordered the quesadilla stuffed with chicken and the meat was sugary sweet. Not my kind of mexican food."}
{"text":"Love the green corn tamale and black bean salsa. Rather pricy though. But one of my FAVES!"}
{"text":"Once again in super biased for obvious reason but I figure that's ok. The crab enchiladas are back! The East MESA locals have developed a real affinity for this beautiful place! Decor is beautiful and the sweet Baja-Style cuisine is amazing! Just to be forewarned, there will most likely be a wait so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I've definitely had better Mexican food in Arizona. The chips and salsa were pretty average. I ordered a pork chimichanga that didn't do anything for my tastebuds. For the price I expected better. I would choose Serrano's over this place any day."}
{"text":"Stuffed enchilada and fish tacos are great! Service has always been good for us. Overall nothing spectacular but always tasty food, good service, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"It's very subpar. The salmon tasted like fire, the Spanish rice tasted like fire, and my mango salsa had no mango. Weird. The quesadilla is not a quesadilla by the way. It's just a single flour tortilla with melted cheese on top. Not a layered deal, just one. Salsas are hella weird too.

Update: staff was really rude when we didn't want boxes. They threw the bill down on the table without saying a word."}
{"text":"Not real Authentic Mexican food that I am used to. Green salsa should not be sweet in my opinion. The Carne asada seems to be cooked in a crock pot. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We thought we would try Tia Rosa again as we had been there 2 previous times with so-so experiences.  This time confirmed why we weren't in a hurry to go back.  We were seated right away and handed menus that had salsa all over the inside of the menu.  It took 3 requests to get chips and salsa although everyone around us got theirs immediately. I thought, Ok, our chips will be fresh. They were not!  Same slow service with taking drink orders and even slower to get those drinks. Food was acceptable, but not good and also not even hot. 
My husband ordered a 2nd beer and was done with his meal prior to getting this. They had the patio doors open but smoke was blowing into the restaurant. Hosts, busboys and servers had to have been aware of this, but no one thought it may be good to shut the door. I personally don't enjoy eating my dinner with the smell of cigarette smoke. 
Overall, this restaurant is always busy but I personally cant figure it out. I guess there is not much around for sit down Mexican restaurants in the vicinity. Next time, back to Nando's on Val Vista and Baseline.....so much better service and the food is excellent (and hot)."}
{"text":"Fast and delicious.  Great service   Fish tacos, bean burrito, yummy.  Guacamole could use more kick but salsa made up for it. ! Def coming back....."}
{"text":"Celebrated our daughters birthday at this fabulous restaurant. She thought it was kinda far to go for Mexican dinner. But, HEY, we are from California and driving a long distance is not a problem.
We called ahead of time, 30 minutes, to put us on the wait list.
Arrived around 5:45 and for a Thursday, this place was packed. Love the decor and the staff. 
I had a Corona Lite and the others had margaritas which they said was delicious.
I had the crab enchiladas with black beans and corn and the rest of our party ordered a variety of Chicken Mole.
Better come hungry to this restaurant 'cause they give you lots of food. One note about the 'mole' it could have been a little thinner and a more generous portion.
Some it was our daughters birthday, they brought out fried ice cream, and charged us for it. For that, I took away one star.
Our server was polite and friendly and took care of us."}
{"text":"My whole family and I absolutely love this place!  Everything we have ever ordered has been excellent.  I love the decor as well!"}
{"text":"Normally I wait until at least a second visit to write a review but in this case there is no need. My companions have dined here several times before and commented extensively about their experiences.
TYou might think just like I do Mexican food is Mexican food, in this case it is a totally different flavorful experience.

The food here taste fantastic! So I had to ask our server what the secret is. Of course she couldn't divulge it all but the basics is a lot of marinade and smoking. Even the refried beans have a wonderful smoky flavor to die for.

In addition to wonderful food was excellent smoky flavor there is a wide variety of sauces to choose from, and the servers are all very happy to work here. Lastly the place is decorated way over the top for a Mexican food restaurant it's eye-candy for the Sonoran taste palate."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in the world.  I have been ordering their baja style shrimp tacos, drinking their passion fruit tea, and stuffing myself with their chips and red salsa for over a decade.  Their cheese crisp is a delicious appetizer, and the strawberry fried ice cream is the perfect way to end the meal.  This place is such a hit with all of my out-of-town family and friends that they demand to come here when coming in for a visit.  Tia Rosa's is nothing if not reliable, and it has such a fun atmosphere.  If you haven't eaten here and fallen in love, you are really missing out."}
{"text":"I just went there the other night for my b-day. First time there.  I plan on going back for lunch tomorrow because I am craving it already and  my hubby ate my leftovers!!! Everything was so delicious. Even  my picky kids loved it. The service was fabulous and the green salsa is the BEST BEST BEST I have ever had by far!!! The only things I would change is that the kids meals are overpriced for what you get. My kids don't eat much, but even they were still hungry after eating their entire meal. At most places they can't finish their food. I think they should give more food for the kids, especially for the price. I also wish they would have done like most restaurants and sang to me on my b-day. lol But I do not regret going and wouldn't change the fact that I spent my birthday there, because overall it was an absolutely wonderful experience and the food was DELICIOUS! They also had a guy that did balloons and magic and that was super cool too- the kids LOVED that and completely forgot that they were still hungry, once he came to our table. I think we will become regular customer's here."}
{"text":"If you are in Mesa, Arizona (first, slow down, they have those &*^%^& cameras that take your picture as you speed through town) and you are in the mood for Mexican, this is the place to go.  I had the chicken Mole and it was wonderful.   It was think and full of flavor.  The chips/salsa was great too.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.   The margaritas were good too.   I highly recommend this place.   Just avoid the speed traps on the way to it.   Personally, I try to avoid Arizona altogether.   However, when I cannot, and I'm around Mesa, I love this place."}
{"text":"Honestly this is the epitome of Americanized Mexican food to me, expensive just because we are sitting down but I'd much rather go to Taco Bell or..... somewhere with AUTHENTIC Mexican food! 2 stars because the food isn't bad just not at all worth it :/"}
{"text":"The decor is awesome. However, the food is just o.k. for me. I would go back but its not on my list of places to eat anytime soon."}
{"text":"Our friend brought us here and not only does the service blow, the food is Sun City bland, salsa too sweet and upcharge galore.  Def never come back!"}
{"text":"We had the Queso Fundido with Taquitos for an appetizer. The dip was great and the chips were great, but the taquitos were dry and boring. For entrees, we had the mole, which was good, but not great. We also had the mango, chipotle chicken and the sauce was great, but the chicken was dry and overcooked. None of the flavor was soaked into the chicken, so it tasted bland.

As others have said, the entrees are very large, so that is a plus.

We would like to come back and try happy hour and some \"safer\" entrees such as the chimichanga and hopefully they will be better executed."}
{"text":"The taqueria is the place to go. It's fast and pretty good. I'm a HUGE fan of the veggie burrito and chipotle potatoes. Both are to die for! That being said, the rest of the menu is good, but nothing spectacular. The service is hit or miss, but the veggie burro is completely worth it."}
{"text":"I want to love this place! We've read all these great reviews and we've given it a shot 1) dine in, 2) take out, and even for a  3) corporate picnic. The service at this location is positively rotten. I'd like to think it's just one or two bad apples and not the bunch, but we've now tried it enough times to  realize the problem at this location runs deep. The food isn't bad. It's just mehh. Fish tacos that are so sweet you don't really want to finish. It's not a bad place, but it's not good. After roughly ten dining experiences here we've decided it isn't worth it any more. It's overpriced and under serviced. It's a real bummer."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to favorite Mexican food places.  The salsa verde and chips are delicious.  Ever since I was younger I've always gotten their bean and cheese burrito and still to this day I still get that.  Great customer service as well!"}
{"text":"Ever since they reopened, the service is horrible. We had to get up and go get our drinks from the bar since the server didn't come over to greet us until 15 minutes later. Slow and unorganized. This is the second experience like this. Get it together."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite meals on a recent trip to Arizona. The place was packed, but we were seated and taken care of very quickly. Our server, Joe, had a great sense of humor and patience with our table. The atmosphere was very fun, if a little loud for conversation. 

We had the chicken quesadilla, chile rellenos, beef chimichanga, chicken carne asada fajitas, and a few different margaritas. It was all really good! The quesadilla had chile strips which added a nice little bite to an otherwise usually tame dish. For sides, these were the best beans I've had at a Mexican restaurant. I'm used to really really bland and mushy beans and hardly ever eat them, but these were very tasty. 

Just a great end to our vacation."}
{"text":"Really good food is the only thing that was on my mind when leaving the Rancho. Ordered the Tia's Plato with chicken. The chicken was amazing. It was so tender and well flavored. The refried beans had a smokey flavor I will be craving long after my visit. The place was packed but the service did not drop off."}
{"text":"5 stars as a great place for a big group. We had about 25 of us. We got our own big room. Service was excellent. They took good care of us in spite of it being a busy Saturday (we arrived just ahead of the dinner rush and finished in the middle of it, and service was great to the end. Melissa was our waitress.)
4 stars food (i'm a foodie and am pretty picky). I had fish tacos - you can pick two kinds. I did a salmon with mango salsa and it was delish! and the other kind I got was the regular fish one, which was just so-so. I wish I would'a picked both as Salmon w/mango. 
My hubby got the Papas Con Carne and he loved it. Our 13-yr-old son got Sweet Pork Enchiladas and loved it - he's kinda picky too.
We will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Sounds like some good Authentic Mexican food but really bland with a New Mex Tex influence to it.  Great atmosphere though.  I am just around the corner but will spend some gas to find me a spot where my tastebuds are taken a bit closer to the border.  Maybe I'll stop in for beers at the nice bar.."}
{"text":"Their tacos are one of a kind. the green salsa is my favorite. I recommend the shrimp tacos but pick one and you will want to come back for more."}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times. The food has been delicious every single time. I highly suggest the shrimp quesadilla. The service is occasionally slow. Overall a great restaurant."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this restaurant since it has won so many awards.  Well to say it was a disappointment is an understatement. I ordered the Baja tacos where I had chosen shrimp and fish. My tacos came out cold not even lukewarm. I sent them back and they came back lukewarm. My husband ordered seafood enchiladas and they were cold as well. We also counted one shrimp in the entire enchilada. The fish in both of foods tasted like old defrosted fish. The chips they served us were oily and chewy. The only positive thing I can say is our waiter Andrew was very sweet and apologetic and my strawberry margarita was amazing. Is was seriously painful to have to pay the bill. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"We go to Tia Rosa every time we are in Mesa on holidays and it is always great. The kids love it, the service is always very good, excellent food for the cost.  Sometimes gets lined up but is worth the wait so just plan to wait a bit on busier days."}
{"text":"Eh, just OK.  I wasn't wowed by the food, and my horchata was very watery and too sweet (and served in a leaking broken cup).  In addition, there was a long wait to be seated, and once we were, service was a bit spotty."}
{"text":"It's depressing this restaurant has just closed. I barely just got into going here a few months ago and they go and close without running it by me first. Unacceptable. I like this place because first from the moment you walk in it seems very authentic looking. I love that when I choose a Mexican restaurant to go to. Once sat we were given chips and a couple salsas both of which were very tasty. The server was very attentive and friendly. They served very large portions here which I love because I love having leftovers. I got a shredded beef burrito which was delicious. Their shredded beef if very high quality and flavorful. It was juicy. The service was fast. Overall everything here was great both times I went. Unfortunately I won't be able to go ever again."}
{"text":"Superb lunch on the patio with out of state family! Shrimp tacos were amazing ! Our waitress Tapatia was great."}
{"text":"Tonight was date night. The BF wanted to try Tia Rosa since we have been awaiting the arrival for sometime now. It is within walking distance so of course we had HIGH hopes for this place. And we were pretty disappointed. 
Pros
1. Loved the decor. They went ALL out on this. Really does make you feel like you are in mexico. 
2. The Bean Dip App was delish. We really LOVED every bite of it. 
3. We went around 5 and was seated very promptly. 
4. Margarita were pretty good but nothing to really rave about. Id prefer a mexican place with good margarita specials. 
5. THey were quick and prompt with refilling my water. 
6. The service was very prompt as far as getting our drinks and food to the table. 

Cons
1. Service. Our waitress was not the friendliest. I asked if she recommended a margarita and she really didn't have a good answer. Kinda pointed at a few things but there was no,  \"O Yes, You should def try...\" I think being a new place in a new location the staff should be very informative and up beat.. When we ordered the enchiladas, we were told we could not have one beef and one chick. We had to pick one meat and one sauce. Not mix and match. Kinda odd, I said to her Ive never been to a place that doesnt allow that. Is there a reason? (bc maybe there is), she said I don't know. Ok then. I think with the economical status we are in, there must be more energetic upbeat people dying for a job. 
2. Price. We had an app, 2 Margaritas, 2 entrees and split a friend ice cream. And our bill was $60. For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone. 
3. Chips. Each time we got chips there were about 15-20 per basket, the were constantly needing to refill them. Even with our BIG bowl of app bean dip, it came with about 20 chips and the bowl of dip was HUGE, the chip porportion was way off!
4. Extra sour cream, $1.00. WOW!

And in the middle
1. Fried Ice Cream, it was friend ice cream with strawberries. I really prefer the honey over the strawberry anyday. Wasnt my fave. And I LOVE fried ice cream. 
2. Chips and Salsa were ok. Nothing to rave, I would say average. 


I think with the place being new and in a great location, the management would be more hands on. I love more than anything when a manager walks the floor to check on the customers. I think that is AWESOME. But this didn't happen while I was there. In the end, I wanted to ask for the manager and tell them to go across the way and step inside Oreganos. BC those people that work over there are the friendliest and Happiest people Ive ever seen in the food service. 

I would say to give Tia Rosa a chance and see what you think But in my opinion, I've had much better as far as mexican goes. 

I look forward to the other side opening to see the menu and prices. I would def love to see if they have a happy hour bc Id love to go for the bean dip and Margaritas :)"}
{"text":"Salmon and shrimp tacos are exceptional. Burros and the green salsa have been my favorites also for over 10 years and not once have they disappointed! Delicious food and good Diablo margarita"}
{"text":"My new favorite.  clean, friendly and good food. I just wish they were a little closer to home (south Scottsdale)."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I come here the food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. They have great prices on food and great drinks! My favorite is the 3 tacos appetizer. You get a chicken, steak and pork taco wrapped in corn tortillas. A lot of Mexican food places in AZ are hit and miss, this place has great tasting everything, down to the beans and chips and salsa. Each Mexican food places I like, I like for different reasons, because of a certain dish, or what I am in the mood for. I wish I could combine 3 different Mexican food places around the valley to make 1 delicious one haha. This place has always grabbed my attention because of their tacos and tequila specials! I also have a friend who loves this place too, so its our little spot to have a great meal, great conversation and surrounded by fun people for a good night.

I am certain when you come here you wont be disappointed! Check out their happy hour when you can. Keep it up Tia Rosa!"}
{"text":"Visiting Gilbert and had a large group come here for dinner. 15 people. The waiter, Dennis, called himself Dennis the Menace when asked what his name was, was annoying. Trying to be funny and each time just more annoying. It took him 40 minutes to take our order!!!!! It took 25 min to get chips and salsa on the table. Took 25 min. for him to bring my niece a soda, and for 6 people around one table they dropped one salsa and one tray of chips...Really!! 
Food was so so, black beans tasted funny, didn't eat them and the sweet pork enchiladas were not sweet at all. We were at that place over 2 hours!!!! Ridiculous!! Sad thing they didn't  live up to their reputation. Glad I won't ever have to
go back there again!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. It is a fun atmosphere and the food is exceptional. The food by itself makes it my favorite Mexican restaurant. The reason I am not giving it a five is because I have always had poor to okay service here. One time, I never even got the horchata I ordered and the wait time after we got to our table was ridiculous. Still, the food makes it worth it and I just come during a time that isn't as busy now."}
{"text":"I've been to the original RDTR, in Mesa, and always was pleased with the food and the service.
This location, well, let's just say it's no Mesa.  I'm not sure what happened at this location and don't know about the Mesa location as I haven't been there in a while, but this location is very so-so.
I've gone a few times now, really wanting to give it a shot, but each time I am coming up empty.
I won't go into alot of detail and describe everything.  Instead I will just say, \"the food is just average\".
Too bad, as I always liked the other location.  I don't think I will go back until I see the reviews rebound."}
{"text":"Talk about a horrible experience.  $100 gift certificate reneged. Would only give $80 because they were apparently \"under new management.\"  This happened to us about a year ago.  Sorry for the delay.  But you can't do this when you continue to operate under the same business name.  You're making money from the goodwill built up by the Tia Rosa business... you're screwing the customers that built that goodwill with their patronage.   Wish I would have posted this earlier.  You cannot burn your own customers like that and steal money from them. You will not get quality from somebody that does this."}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant. Used to he eat there a lot over the years. They had a small fire from what I understand and the main restaurant has been closed for more than 6 months but they kept open the taqueria. My daughter and I recently went to the taqueria where the counter staff was rude and the food was dry and tasteless. I was not surprised when I drove by the other day and the place was now completely closed and they were moving all of the furniture out. I hate to see that beautiful restaurant closed down but really the food and service was slipping so I guess for them it was a good decision..but non the less it will be missed!"}
{"text":"The most tasteless mexican food I've ever had. 

I gave the 2 stars because the service was great considering we went as a large party. Everything came out in a timely fashion and correctly. Our server was also really nice.

But the food is awful. Just terrible. Kind of defeats the purpose of it being a restaurant... Just sayin'."}
{"text":"I wanted to have a nice Mexican dinner. Other than the hostess, Amber, the service was subpar.  Service seemed disinterested and rushed. The pork on the Flying Saucer was over cooked. Ran out red salsa for chips, but when pressed about it. Red salsa was found. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and two small girls came here for breakfast today. Two words: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! 

The girls shared a full stack of pancakes with buttermilk syrup. The buttermilk syrup alone is enough to come back time and time again. My husband who isn't really a \"pancake person\" took one taste and said that this is one of the best breakfast restaurants in town! Also my very picky 5 year old raved about the pancakes and asked if we can always come here for breakfast! 

I had the chilaquiles, which were delicious! My husband had a breakfast burrito with bacon, and he ate every bite! Whenever family is in town we plan to bring them here to eat. We will definitely be back to try the french toast and many other menu items! The coffee is delicious and perfect- not too strong and not too weak. 

Adam was our server. He was wonderful! Very helpful and attentive! 

Thank you Rancho De Tia Rosa for a perfect family meal!"}
{"text":"Festive food in a festive atmosphere.  I love the fish tacos: a great place for a group or a romantic evening."}
{"text":"Blech. Save yourself some money and grab some chalupas at Taco Bell. 

Service was good. Our waitress was very attentive. Interior was crazy cluttered, but still had a fun colorful vibe. I think the overkill may be because of the addition of Christmas decorations on top of what they already had there. 

Never a good sign when you don't even like the starter chips and salsa. The red was straight up tomato flavor. Needs some fresh ingredients to brighten it up. The green is sweet, almost syrupy. Just weird. 

I had the 3 tacos appetizer and the bean dip. The other two in my party ordered the carnitas.  Nothing was terrible but still so lacking in flavor. The soft tacos were sitting in juices, so they were soggy and fell apart.  Best thing was the bean dip...after I took it home, added fresh salsa and some cheese to it. 

Overall, not enough fresh ingredients and not enough flavor."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican Food here!  Love the smokey flavors!  Great food, great service, wonderful bar, clean all the way.  The ambiance is unquestionably great."}
{"text":"Not worth it unless you don't know mexican food. Everything taste fresh out of a can. Too pricey for the lack of quality. Maybe because you're paying for the decor."}
{"text":"Huge portions at a great price.  Flavor was excellent and the place was packed.  I ordered 3 meat plate and it was a lot of food.  The rice and beans are excellent as well.  If you decide to go consider splitting a plate or be ready to take home some leftovers.  I ate my left overs and they were just as delicious."}
{"text":"I travel for business and dine out all of the time. I was unfortunate to come across this restaurant that had a very nice decor but horrible food. I witnessed several people including myself that had a few bites and left the food for pickup."}
{"text":"Ny husband and I went there for the first time last night. The atmosphere is great and everyone was friendly. That being said, the salsa was sweet, I actually thought they used sugar instead of salt. I asked the server and she said \"it IS different\". We ordered some hot salsa to cut the sweet flavor.  I ordered the pork green chili burrito and it was sweet too! No green chili taste that I longed for. The tefried beans were excellent, but the rice was flavorless. I was afraid to order dessert because I thought it would be salty and spicy. Overall, very disappointing. I am an Arizona native, so this is not my first experience with Mexican food."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited for 10 minutes for servers to catch up before sitting, not a bad wait but that should have been clue one. Sat and immediately ordered drinks from the bar as well as water and bean dip. Bean dip, chips and salsa came  and we reminded about the water. After about 25 minutes we asked for water again. At this point, we've eaten lots of salsa and dip and are begging for water. The waitress agrees and then just aimlessly wanders around the restaurant. Also, we still have not received our drinks from the bar yet. So we asked to pay for our bean dip and leave. Waitress seemed offended and walked off. After a bit of her being gone we just left money and walked out. 

This whole time, the place is only half full with no one on the patio. Honestly the most careless services I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"We haven't been for a few years since we are now in Gilbert but when we were in Mesa we'd bring guests from out of state. They enjoyed it as well as our grandchildren. We all had a great time. It was crowded but fun."}
{"text":"So sad to hear that this place has closed. I ate  here a couple times and the food was delicious. I know they've been in the business for years so i know well be seeing them again soon!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Tia Rosa before it branched out and is now two restaurants, and I can tell you I love it just the same now as I did back them.  Love this place, give it try i really dont think you will be disappointed.  I have some family members that think the food is a little on the sweet side, so if you like really spicy may want to stick with Los Dos Malino's.  But if you want great flavor go to Tia Rosa's."}
{"text":"We ate here because so many people had told us that it was amazing. My meal (the honey glazed shrimp) was great. The atmosphere is fun with all of the bright colors. The salsa was much too sweet for my liking, our app (the bean/cheese dip) did not have any of the 'kick' it claimed on the menu - and was just downright bland. My husband liked his burro, but it was filled with the same bean mixture that we had had as an app, so he was pretty much done with the bean thing. Overall it was an ok experience, but seeing as it is a Mexican place, and there was no spice in any of our food, even the salsa, I have to say I was disappointed. Especially after all of the rave reviews. To each their own I suppose."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened up this second location a little closer to my house! This place is great! They have the best margaritas and food! They are a little pricier than other nearby mexican restaurants but its worth it. The have great happy hour deals too, the only downside is that they only offer happy our in the bar area which is very small so it fills up fast. My favorite is the fish tacos and my husband loves their chicken mole."}
{"text":"I was promised great Mexican food here. What I got was very, very good Mexican food. Still...I'll take it!

We had reservations for our big group (15 people) at approximately 7:30, but weren't seated until closer to 8. That's a bummer, but oh well. As a result, we ran past their closing time which I felt bad about, though we did not do so on purpose and did not linger. 

The first thing that hit me was somewhat negative - it's cramped. Really cramped. Many tables need to rely on other tables having their chairs pushed in enough, and having worked out that day and had very little to eat in order to fit. Even within tables, they seem to pack them in, elbow to elbow. The smaller the group, the better. 

It all goes up from there. Margaritas were delicious and strong enough without being lethal. Service was fantastic throughout - timely refills, friendly service, and a willingness to run 15 separate transactions. Funny thing though - it wasn't the final amoutn split 15 times, but rather each and every menu item on the bill split 15 times (since we said it was okay to just do an even split). Nothing wrong, it was just kind of funny to see \"1/15 Margarita. 1/15 Chicken Mole. 1/15 Cheese Quesadilla\". FYI, 1/15th of a Sprite is very, very little money. 

Now on to the food. I only had my one dish, but it was very excellent. Chicken Mole with tons of tender chicken chunks and a rich but not overpowering mole sauce. All of the spices seemed to be in proper balance. The rice was good, but I wish there was a bit more of it. I am not a mole expert, but one person at our table got it as well and, as someone who has it frequently, she said it was some of the better mole. Everyone else seemed very happy with their selections, be they salads, tacos, whatever."}
{"text":"We live right down the street from Tia Rosa, and so we stopped in for lunch. The chips are not the best I have ever had, but the salsa is amazing! It is spicy and fresh. I ordered the Spinach Enchiladas and they were delicious. It is pricy for Mexican food. I think my enchiladas were $14. All in all, I would eat there all the time if someone else was paying."}
{"text":"BEST MARGARITAS I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME!

And they run really good happy hour and follow on facebook prices ($3 for a top notch margarita!)

I've been here 3 times and it's a solid classic mexican food joint.  If you are in the mood of a HUGE plate of food, with beans/rice - then this is a good choice.

Good salsa/chips! I wasn't impressed with their dessert (the ice cream sundae and churros - pass)...and come to think of it the food wasn't THAT memorable either. I guess the great margaritas have made me think highly of this place."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. We tried sweet pork. The issue was placing us in a side room with a huge high school birthday party. Horrible and uncomfortable first experience. If they would have put us with other customers and not a private room party the stars  would have been much higher. The server (Lino) was the best part of the experience, he was very good. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the East Valley! I hate to call it 'Mexican food' because that will probably make you think of the typical burritos and tacos you get at every other 'chain' restaurant - BORING. The owner/chef really puts an exotic twist on many of the dishes. My favorite is the Shrimp Mazatlan which is a beautiful mix of Jumbo shrimp and Pineapple skewered over a bed of rice. Ingredients are always fresh (the owner has his own garden behind the restaurant! 
Been enjoying their menu since when they were in a little strip mall. Even back then their popularity caused crowds standing in the parking lot waiting to get a seat! Their new location is really classy so you can dress up of a nice dinner. But you'll still be in a crowd outside waiting for your seat. Believe me it's one of the few restaurants in the East Valley that's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very good food and you could not ask for a more fun environment. We have a lot of Mexican food in Mesa and this is by far the best!  Try the salmon enchiladas or the seafood tacos...WOW! You also can't go wrong with their mole sauce! They also have a killer vanilla bean ice cream with actual vanilla beans! So good..I'm getting hungry just writing about it. GO THERE! :)"}
{"text":"We went for dinner with friends.   Everyone was extremely disappointed and we will not be back.   
I ordered tacos al carbon and was served roast beef.   Tacos al carbon means \"grilled\" meat...not roast beef.   When I thought I had the wrong plate (since it obviously wasn't \"carbon\") waiter looked at me crazy and said that was Tacos al carbon!  Even our friends, who wouldn't know the translation of their orders disliked the food.   Chips where from the supermarket, and salsa from a jar.
Very sad and disappointed...this restaurant is right around the corner from my house and we hoped we would have a new restaurant to frequent."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and atmosphere! I am so glad that this has reopened. It is my go to spot for a quality evenig out for Mexican."}
{"text":"Sooo much self loathing going on after eating here. Thank god for sweatpants and Tums.  This place is super gimmicky and the food was not good.  I couldn't believe the amount of people packed in here for subpar Mexican.  The portions are huge, which I guess is a plus for some... But I'd much rather have quality over quantity."}
{"text":"First time at this location.  To me it's not the same as the old location.  The chips and salsa were good.  I had the spinach enchiladas.  Black beans were very good as well as the corn.  Enchiladas didn't seem as good as I remembered.  My wife had salmon tacos.  Salmon was very good but hard to eat with so much other filling in them.  If I were rating just the service I would have given it a five star review.  Our server was Cierra and she was excellent.  Stopped by every few minutes to make sure all was well.  Also the attendant for the chips and salsa was very good... checking every few minutes to see if we needed anything.  With so many other Mexican restaurants around we probably won't be back for another 5 years."}
{"text":"This place is a super cool cultural place. Right when you walk in there's visuals everywhere! Right when my family and I entered the hostesses greeted us pleasantly with big smiles, I felt very welcomed! We got sat immediately. It was nice that our hostess was even conversing to us as we were walking to our table. Within 2 seconds after we sat down we got our fresh hot chips and salsa. Our server Maddy was absolutely wonderful and checked in on us frequently. She always made sure our drinks were refilled before they were empty. Overall, the restaurant was a very family oriented place and I plan on coming back and I encourage others to take your families and friends for a great Mexican experience!!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. The service is always great and the staff is always funny"}
{"text":"Call ahead to get onto their waiting list and sit inside if it is a chilly day.  Otherwise, you are going to get cranky and possibly rank Rancho de Tia Rosa lower than it deserves.  My mom had the Tres Amigos margarita and said it was the best she's had in her life.  I tried some chips, salsa, pineapple salsa, homemade herbal dressing, fish taco, shrimp taco, and a cheese crisp. Huge drinks! :) Everything is super fresh tasting and you can't go wrong there.  Maybe avoid the burrito and chimichanga - those are mostly just some meat inside a tortilla - I mean, you know?  You crack open the tortilla and there's just some dry meat in there most places you go.  I was kind of amazed though that two seafood tacos were $14 and that was without any side dishes at all.  Not worth that much.  Love the food and the Valentine's Day decor up.  The festive environment is awesome.  It reminds me of some Texas Mexican restaurants and places like Z-Tejas though."}
{"text":"This was our second time here to try it again since the last visit wasn't pleasant but hey, why not? My husband and I were placed in the bar area and our server was ok but it was obvious she was stretched thin with her tables. She was very nice so no issue there. The problem we had was two minutes in to our meal, a COCKROACH starts running across our table. It took all my willpower to not scream and run off and my husband just set his fork down and said, yeah I'm done. We let our server know and she naturally is mortified and runs off to find her manager. The manager never shows up; just tells our server to let us know our meal was comped. This is why I'm annoyed. Don't make a server do your dirty work; YOU'RE THE MANAGER!! And it also let me know this manager is well aware that there is a bug problem there. Needless to say, we won't be returning./.."}
{"text":"I had dinner here once when it first opened.  I drive by here everyday because it's in my neighboorhood.  I don't know what happened but it's a shame that they closed their doors already.  This location is a great spot and the other restaurants there do a great business.  It's sad to see a restaurant open and close so quickly.  I hope the space won't remain empty for too long."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the work the owners did on the building.  When we went on Wednesday night it was very crowded with a 20 to 30 minute wait.  Once seated it was rather noisy due to the number of people.  The wine glasses were dirty. However the food was good, the price was reasonable, and I think the decor won me over.  It had a lot of style which somehow made up for it faults.  I'll be back hopefully at a less busy time."}
{"text":"Two words...GREEN SALSA!! I would come here if the only items on the menu were chips and green salsa. It is delicious and good enough to drink! Other than the salsa, I love their quesadillas and fish tacos. The service was good, even though they didn't ask if we wanted a refill on our chips or drinks until we were almost finished eating. The restaurant decor is spot on with the added bonus of Spanish music! This is a great family place I will be returning to again and again!"}
{"text":"Is it the fault of the restaurant if we were being serve by a bad waiter? Wrong food given, The waiter doesn't pay much attention while talking to us and when our bill came it was also a mistake. Everything didn't turn out right! My wife and I stared at each other when the other customer said in a loud voice that this waiter did an good job for them. Maybe we started on a wrong foot or it's just a bad hair day for this waiter! Hey, not everything didn't turned out bad....THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT. Maybe in my next visit I shall write a better review for this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! We've only been to the location on McKellips. There isn't a bad dish. The carne asada is wonderful. Salsas are great too. There are several to choose from so be sure to ask to taste one of the others, though the default red and green salsas are really good!"}
{"text":"Terrible service had half of the order wrong and when we called back to tell them they pretty much told us i dont know what i can do for you and wouldnt give us a credit or remake the food for us i dont recomend going there at all"}
{"text":"WANTED to like it! Love the decor, and ambiance - but the food cannot be described in any manner as Mexican ( and we LOVE Mexican food ) To begin with, the green sauce was SO sweet as to be inedible. The red was ok, still not spicy at all, but had some smoky notes we appreciated. El pastor is pork! Or is in authentic cuisine- here's it's beef. My daughter said her red burro was ok, and while the shrimp in my enchiladas was plump and sweet, so was the green sauce, again negating the positive from the quality of the shrimp. And, not to be picky, but the bottled beer costs the same as the draft, and having had a tap myself for years, I know that draft beer is cheaper to buy per glass - and most restaurants pass that savings on in lower tap beer prices. Not here. Not a repeat."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is muey beuno!, even though it is in Mesa. I try not to go to Mesa, if I don't have too. (yes I am a snob, by at least I recognize that fact) Mesa to me is TOO suburban, in the middle of the Metroplex that is Phoenix. BUT (insert a big But here) You need to make your way to Mesa to hit this joint up. I can't say if it's authentic Mexican because I don't know what that means anymore, but Its delicious!, Like I said at dinner when asked \"how's your food?\" My response \"Scrum-dittily-umptious!\" (2 points to the person can name that movie this line is from) I ordered the grilled halibut, with Mango Chutney and sauted Spinach, of course it came with Spanish rice. It was perfect! I love fish done differently, and Halibut is great grilled. The smoky flavor of the fish, basted in a honey and spice marinade, with the fruit, put the combo in combination. After spending the day watching Planet Terror, I couldn't eat anything that resemble meat, or flesh, or BBQ. (zombies movies and food put the bad in bad combination) I did enjoy the green salsa with chips, the red wasn't so great however. They have a great atmosphere and really nice outdoor seating. It is very distinct and unique, and the service is excellent. It is a perfect place for kids, family, or just plain fun. I would say out of all the Mexican joints I have been too, this is the best in my opinion. Extra points because they serve crushed iced, not cubed. I love that with water or diet coke. 

No threat of Mexi-cali blues here..Just enjoy the food but watch out for the balloon bearing, comedic presence of \"Dirty Sanchez\" It is this guy dressed up like a Mexican in a Sombrero, if you make eye contact he will start entertaining your table. The Mariachi Band is nice, I just wish they would stick to Mexican and Spanish songs, their cover of \"It's a Small World After All\", is rather sad. They take requests, and unfortunately people, want to hear English songs. I prefer the music in their dialect, it adds to the charm."}
{"text":"Once I moved to Az, this was the first Mexican restaurant I was impressed with! Portion sizes are huge!! Enough to feed 2-3 people with one plate!

It's really cute outside and a place to go with friends or a date. Sitting outside is one of my favorites! They spray water and its nice to cool you down!"}
{"text":"We loved the Queso!  I did notice that the serving staff seem to be preoccupied and huddling with private conversations that had nothing to do with tending to the patrons you're getting your attention or sometimes challenging.  Their conversations were loud and personal nature."}
{"text":"This location is not the original...however the food is just as good. It is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants and I have been coming to Rosas for 15+ years (original location)...
The key is to dip thr chips in the red and green salsa and make a combo pack, so good! My favorite menu item is the veggie burrito with green sauce...but the shrimp tacos and flying saucer with beef are amazing too! The wait sucks during dinner time so just be aware of that and the service is sometimes questionable...but the food clearly makes up for it."}
{"text":"This is a true gem by Mesa culinary standards... perhaps the finest restaurant in all of Mesa! This is a place to bring out-of-towners. A place to celebrate fiesta's, and a place to get hammered on massive margaritas. The restaurant is really more of a Spanish fortress than an eatery. Oh, and good luck parking.

Tip: The back patio is muy-romantico in the cooler months."}
{"text":"My family has been a huge fan of Tia Rosas for years and I have recently introduced my office staff to them. Unfortunately it seems that every single time I order from this location with my office something is wrong. I seem to have to fight them for salsa every time I go to pick up the food. I'm not asking for much, just enough for the 3-5 ppl ordering food. Usually they try to get away with giving us just 1 or two little salsa containers and I have to fight them to give me just one more. This last time we ordered food I ordered their three rolled taco combo. Which is 3 taquitos and a small side of rice and beans. I got back to my office and opened my box of food only to find a foil wrapped bean burrito.... I'm not even sure how they get it that wrong. This is not the first time they've completely messed up orders and I think that when I am paying for their food and services my order should be right. Calling and letting them know they messed up does no good, you get a flippant response with an uncaring apology. I would tell anyone who was thinking of trying this restaurant that they MUST eat in, so when your food comes out wrong you have somewhere you can send it back to."}
{"text":"First time here. My mother in law ordered the beef Chimichanga and got an extra wire bonus in her food. She chipped her tooth biting into it. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow I can't not believe how bad the services has gotten ever since we switched ownership. Beta no longer have the complimentary bean dip with the chips and salsa and he saw those are bland and lack of flavor. My mother and I were stop by the hostess promptly. Out waitress was a completely different story. I took her about 12min before she even acknowledged that we were here. One of the buss boys brought us the chips and salsa, he was very friendly. After sitting for another 15min with out any contact with out waitress another busser brought use more chips and salsa. Finally out waitress came back and took our order. She was stand off-ish and kinda rude. I had a question about a drink on the menu she didint even let me finished before she snatched my menus and walked away. Another employ brought our food. My mom got enchiladas witch she enjoyed. I got the meat plate with pork. The meat was extremely dry, the lettuce was a nasty drown colore like it had start to  go bad. I had guacamole and sour cream but after one scup it was gone. My tortilla was completely hard only a few soft parts that I was able to eat. And for some reson my whole plate was soaked with water (NASTY) 
I also got two sides of beans witch I never got.  Our waitress NEVER CHECKED ON USE THROUGH THE WHOLE MEAL, when she did finally come back it was to give us our check. With the new ownership I am extremely disappointed in the quality of food and service. This used to be my family's go to spot. 
My family and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The menu is great, the same as N. Mesa location, decore and site is great however service is lousy every time we go, napkins are too cheap and small as well. The manager seems to have dinner with his family right out in the bar when they are slammed... Most of the staff seem to be inexperienced high school kids... we have since stopped going because of this even though we live less than a mile away. Seems like a training and hiring issue..."}
{"text":"They no longer have the famous home made ice cream. Food quality has declined.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"This is not another 'beans and rice' Mexican food place.  Sure, they have both beans and rice, but the stars of the show in my book are the pork and seafood dishes.  I think my favorite is the Nuevo Chile Relleno, which is stuffed with pulled pork and surrounded by a red pepper sauce.  I think the horchata is great, and my wife absolutely loves the pork burrito with green sauce -- double beans, no rice.

I think they won the Best of Phoenix for Neighborhood Mexican Restaurant in 2011, and they do get pretty crowded just about every night.  The turnoff for the parking lot sneaks up on you, so you have to pay attention, especially at night when it is much more difficult to see.

They seem to spend a lot of time decorating the place for holidays (Christmas is the biggest, but Valentine's day was pretty impressive as well), so the ambiance is nice -- but it does get loud in the main dining area.

If you don't care about table service, the little building in the parking lot is a taqueria where you can just get the food and drink in an even more casual setting"}
{"text":"I came to visit Arizona from Utah for an interview and while staying with a friend of mine I got the recommendation to try this place. Evidently a lot of people really like this place. First of all, I'm gonna begin by saying I do not have the slightest idea of what is authentic and what is not. So if you're wondering if the food is authentic, then I'm probably not the most reliable source. However, I did really like the food here. The chips and salsa were good. The green sauce was really sweet. Like reeeeally sweet. Which for me isn't too bad because I can't handle spicy. I'm a baby when it comes to spicy food. Not only because it makes me uncomfortable but also because it makes my soda taste awful after I've eaten something spicy. I love my soda.....  The price was reasonable and it has a fun atmosphere. Definitely a place to socialize. Anyways. The food was tasty, I got the chicken burrito off of the lunch menu and it was more than enough to fill me up and it was less expensive. It was really good too. Nothing to write home about but it was good. Our server was also really nice."}
{"text":"This is always on the \"must go to\" list when I have out of town guests.  The patio is really, really nice - especially if you can get the private patio off to the side (you need to request it - and have a large party) with its own private fireplace and view of the grassy gardens in the back.  I am a huge fan of the seafood enchiladas - and the flying saucers are really good too!"}
{"text":"Did not like the food here.  Starting from the chips and salsa they put on our table I knew it was gonna be a bad meal.  The salsa was not good - it was sweet.  I asked the waiter to bring me the hot stuff.  When that came, it was hot but also sweet!  I thought this place was Mexican food!??!  

So I ordered a shredded beef enchilada. And guess what?  The enchilada sauce was sweet. Didn't even taste like enchilada sauce!  Basically if you are a diabetic don't come here!!  Too much sugar and sweets in everything. 

But the nachos were good.  The meal was somewhat saved a little bit when I found out that they have Negra Modelo on draft."}
{"text":"Anything you order here is great however, the fish and shrimp tacos and stuffed quesadillas are amazing.  I also love the beans here as they have a nice smokey flavor.  The tamales are also really great !  Before this place became so well known we would eat in the main restaurant but now we just go eat at the Taqueria (it is a much quicker option).  It is more of a take out type design however, there are a few seats available inside and also outside. You don't have the choices from a full menu (or free chips and salsa) that you would have in the main restaurant.  The sides are usually very small portions and if you need extra salsa you have to pay for it (along with chips and salsa).  I'd give 5 stars but I get irritated to pay for extra salsa!"}
{"text":"Tia Rosas is one of our favorite places to take visitors and to get that Mexican cuisine fix.  I've never had a bad meal here and neither has any of our guests.  It's usually fairly busy so get there early.  Only thing I can complain about is that they didn't keep the location on McKellips open!  We love this place!"}
{"text":"The handles have been removed from the doors.  They say its for remodeling, I say... tell the truth Tia Rosa, because it doesn't make sense to close a 3 month old restaurant for remodeling.  I just don't understand why this location needs to be closed for a patio remodel... and I've driven by this location a handful of times since being closed, and have yet to see any work being done on the patio.

Well, back in the days when they were open, I recall the booth seats we sat in being narrower than the pequeno streets of Laredo, but the interior decor was fabulous.

The complimentary salsas (red & green) were mild and very sweet, but you can request a hotter variety.  I didn't care for any of the three.  The basket of chips was pretty meager and seemed store-bought.  Tia Rosa, go visit Serrano's, Si Senor or Chevy's to find out what a good chip and salsa combo looks like.

The lunch special is a great value, and I find their beans to be above average, as they are flavored with a smokey bacon (or some other pork product)

Your bar area seems a bit cramped, and I'd suggest extending the happy hour past 5:00pm, while including some discounted appetizer fare.

So long Tia Rosa, I barely knew ye"}
{"text":"I like this place, I come maybe once a year while visiting my parents, good food.  I have enjoyed multiple things on this menu: the seafood tacos, the shrimp quesadillas ( how can I make this at home?), always generous with the chips and salsa and their margaritas are so refreshing!"}
{"text":"If you would have asked me a year ago about this place I probably would have had a better review...my oh my, how things have changed.  My husband and I used to be regulars here.  We live close by and would walk up a couple times a week and sit outside for happy hour.  It was our spot.  They knew us and how we operated.  You get seated where they know you like it and sometimes even have your drinks before you order them.  When you spend over $400 a month at a restaurant you typically get think treated right.  We tip well and our servers knew it.

We returned last night to try it out again and because the weather was nice for walking.  We walked in and saw two open tables in the bar.  It was 5:26pm, just enough time to order a burrito and a couple margaritas.  We were told by the hostess that the tables were reserved.  Huh, who knew you could reserve tables for happy hour in the bar.  You can no longer seat yourself on their out front patio because it is now closed in and under construction...which has been \"under construction\" for some time now. 

I could go on and on, but what's the point.  Everyone who knew us as regulars are no longer working there and no one cares about the amount of money we have dropped at this place.  It's just sad.  We never really came here for the food, it was more the experience and now that its gone....there is no reason.

Thanks for the good times Tia.  We'll miss what you used to be."}
{"text":"As a native Arizonan and Mexican food lover I don't dig this place at all. I mean, it looks great and has nice patios but the food and prices are lame. Our waiter couldn't answer questions about the food. Simple questions, even. The rice is the blandest Mexican rice I've had and the beans are overwhelmed by an artificial bacon and liquid smoke flavor. The chips were passable but the red salsa was impotent and the green sauce tastes like it's half sugar. I had a pork burro, and the meat was of good quality but flavorless not to mention they put the same bad-tasting beans into the burro too, which was not mentioned on the menu. And $8 for a 10\" cheese crisp? C'mon. In this town, you don't have to drive far to get good Mexican food at a good price but you will have to drive past this place. Sorry."}
{"text":"Really too bad.  Great service, great building and decor, but the food was very bland.  We probably won't be back...."}
{"text":"stopped in for lunch for some fish tacos from Tia Rosa's Taqueria today. Taqueria area is mainly where you can grab a quick bite, take-out or casual dining. The tacos are $3.49 per taco and if you want to add rice and beans, it's 2.00 dollars.
The fish was excellent quality, it was halibut which is one of my favorite fish, but what was odd was the sweet flavor to the tacos. It's like they put a little honey on the fish? I like honey but not for my fish tacos. 
I will give them another try and next time I will eat in the restaurant not the Taqueria. Tia Rosa was A-Ok with me."}
{"text":"After coming to this place for a few years now,  I can definately say they are consistent with the quality of thier food and drinks. Last night I ordered the Nuevo Chili Relleno, that is a Roasted fresh poblano chili stuffed with pork picadillo, pinon nuts, sour cream, cheese, roasted red bell pepper sauce, and rice or refried beans. It was a tough choice, but I ordered the rice.  It was a little warm yesterday but we chose to sit outside on the back patio. Our server Jaime was super busy and had her hands full, but with it being Cinco De Mayo it was totally understandable. The place was packed!  Jaime is a great server and makes sure you have everything you need to habe a memorable experience. Food was delicious! Drinks on point! Service was really good! This restaurant is always a good choice!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from New Mexico and I'm in Mexican food hell!  Help!!!  Although more edible than the last place that was recommend, no Clamato? No bloody Mary's?  No eggs?  Horrible chips and salsa.  Always a sticking point with me, as I could seriously live off chips and salsa.  That had me worried right off the bat, so I figured a chimichanga would be safe.  Hell they are good even from the frozen aisle right?  Most uncrispy chimi ever.  And the rice, well, I'll just quit there.

Really is a shame because the restaurant itself is very well decorated and prices seemed pretty reasonable, but it makes me scared to try what else is out there."}
{"text":"From here on out this will be my go to spot when i get my Mexican cravings! Lovely atmosphere both indoors and out on the patio. The prices are for sure unbeatable and the quality of food is excellent. I'm talking plates (big plates) starting at 9 bucks. Service was good and they are very accommodating to make your order just the way you want it. Whole list of exotic margaritas also...and i love free shit (especially if its food)so you know the chips and salsa that came out when we sat down put a big smile on this girls face.

Good for family, date night, gossip time with the girls etc..

muy delicioso !"}
{"text":"Little bit crowded but the bar was easily accessible for a cold draft. Off to a good start."}
{"text":"It's Saturday night and you don't mind waiting for your food then it's worth it.  If they accept reservations then you need to do it a couple of days before.  We had a party of 11 and I was impressed at how fast we were served.  We called ahead to be added to the list and then waited about an hour to be seated.   The place was packed.  The parking lot was full and once it's full there isn't any other alternatives to parking.  

The atmosphere was nice and they have a magician entertain you while you wait for a table.  Which is really great if you have children with you.  

My husband and I were not happy when the waitress forgot stuff for his meal and we had to flag down the manager.   She was great at making sure we all had water and drinks.   Also when we got our bill it took her about 30 minutes to take our money and then rounded up and kept the change as her part of her tip when she already included an 18% gratuity on our bill.  It is little things like that can make people upset.  

Now for the food.   I had a quesadilla that cost $12 served with rice and beans.   If anything I enjoyed the beans the most.   The quesadilla was okay but I prefer the one I get at Qdoba more.   The rice was uninspriring and rather bland.   

Their green verde salsa is to die for.   The group as a whole seemed to enjoy it the most and kept getting refills of chips.   I also ordered ice tea which I wasn't warned about was passion fruit.  Not my favorite type of tea either but it was okay.  So I drank more water instead.  

Anyway, it's an okay place to eat at but I can't say I'll go there often.  Not a big fan of overpriced mexican food."}
{"text":"Really like this place. The environment is great, reminds me a lot of Mexico. The food is pretty good and never really had a bad experience here. I watched a show on the Mesa channel on Cox and is displayed the owner, I can't remember his name, but I always love to know who the owner is and the story about the restaurant. I wouldn't say that the food is the best I have ever had, but pretty consistently good. Excellent chips and salsa, the fried ice cream is great, but had the cheesecake, next time I will pass on that, but their key lime pie is pretty good."}
{"text":"It was not as good the last few times as it was in previous years. It's just barely ok now. Most of the food I had had very little taste including the salsa."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why Yelp wont let me update my past review, but that's on them. Since my review of the dining room, K and I have been to happy hour 4 times. I wanted to toss out some Kudos to Andrew who served us on two of those occasions. Andrew is a good server. The challenge you'll find at Tia Rosa is that they also give servers tables in the dining room as well as the bar. Service is S L O W. Just how it is. The margaritas are very good, the happy hour menu has some incredible deals and if you get the beef nachos ($6.00), there will be enough beef on the nachos to take half off, order a cheese crisp ($3.00) and make a beef quesadilla out of it. I mean the amount of beef is amazing. On the negative side however, is that the nachos tend to end up a bit wet. Very few if any crispy chips. While at happy hour we've had the $1 tacos in both beef and pork renditions. I mean for a buck, seriously. What a deal. We've also had the cheese crisp and beef rolled tacos ($3.50). Really everything on the happy hour menu is a great deal.
The negatives are the soggy nachos, the charge for chips & salsa during h.h., slow service and the hours that happy hour runs. Ending at 6 is fairly common but 5 on a Friday. Who the hell's going to be happy about that? 
Slow Service. Some very good Staff. Great Happy Hour. Good Food. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Tried on line reservation.  No answer, followed up with a second one.  Received response that needed to be made over 5 hours from requested time (first one was 6 hours ahead).  Service was slow.  One of 6 orders showed up about 10 minutes after others.  Took a long time to learn my drink order wasn't ever going to be filled.  Arms on chairs were falling apart.  My order had something on it that wasn't in the menu description.  Food tasted good."}
{"text":"I love the shrimp mazatlan, fish tacos and the green salsa and chips.  My wife really likes the chimichangas."}
{"text":"I suggested the lady I was having a first date pick the place, and she picked this, promising I would not be disappointed.  I was.  Generally, if you start with bad chips and salsa, prepare to be further disappointed.  I had some sort of combo, and nothing stood out as decent, let alone good.  I did not finish, and I did not take leftovers.   I remember feeling that if Denny's served Mexican (do they?), that it would be better.  The search continues."}
{"text":"Okay I'm going to try to be as nice as possible. This was the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten in my life. First of all, we receiverd chips and salsa. The green salsa had a weird sweet flavor to it, the red salsa was something out of a jar. So we continued to place our order. I ordered the pork chimichanga my wife ordered some kind of a taco salad. I swear I feel like the chef had used about two cups of sugar in my pork chimichanga, I could have made a sloppy joe out of the meat, the rice was dry and definitely not authentic. My wife's salad tasted like they   drenched her salad with lime. I asked the waiter in Spanish so that he understood where I come from and ask him do you seriously think that this taste like a chile verde chimichanga and he said it does in this place, we use  honey and sugar.yuck!!! I said I've never had a chili verde burrito that tasted like this. Sorry to say Filibertos blows this place away,only certain Filibertos!! I'm not here to bash employees because everybody is out there to make a living and at least they are working so I will not go there. Sorry but this is nowhere close to authentic Mexican food. You want true authentic, food chose those cool little hole-in-the-wall places you will get that sweet little grandmother working her butt off in the kitchen to please her customers, for half the price. Two stars because i see some of the employees work hard. Those stars go the the hard workes."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food, and the owner even took the time to come thank us since we complemented the food and serive. Tara, our server, was phenomenal!  I'll be back here every time I'm in the area! I definitely recommend the Carne Asada, and the habanero salsa is absolutely amazing, just not for your average gringo! (I pride myself for tolerance, and it teared me up, but the flavor was grrrreat) I really do recommend coming here. Completely amazing and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Love me some great Mexican food and this place exceeds my taste buds expectations.  My favorite dish is Grilled Salmon Enchiladas in an Avocado Sauce served with mango salsa.  Yummy!  The chips and salsa are really good and I especially like the Tomatillo salsa verde that comes out complimentary. The atmosphere is nice and happy hour on the patio is something to do if you want a great deal."}
{"text":"I walked in with my family of 5 and got sat immediately. I especially loved that when we walked in the hostesses were all sorts of happy. Plus the food was AMAZING the meat was tender and juicy. The server was quick and cheerful. Definitely going back soon"}
{"text":"This was a good Mexican place.  Good Mexican seafood.  I used to come here often until they closed down this location.  

The seafood tacos are good.  My parents (from Illinois) had to go here when they came to visit me in Arizona.  They made some good seafood enchiladas also.  Too bad this place closed down."}
{"text":"Delightful atmosphere that is full of color and wonderful design. Mariachis were playing tableside which made the atmosphere fun! You immediately think good food is ahead....

The food....not so great. The food was very bland. The chips did not seem homemade. The menu suggests wonderful flavors in their food, but there actually  wasn't any pizazz or flavor to anything we had. Don't pay extra to try any of the salsas....bleh.

The service was horrible. The waiter did not know the menu nor could he make recommendations as to what the best food was on the menu. I flat out asked him what was most popular and he pointed out a salad. He didn't understand us when we asked questions and he did get some of our order wrong. 

I am really shocked how packed it was considering the flavors weren't good. We had tacos, quesadillas, beans/rice and tried various salsas. If you like authentic Mexican Food native to Arizona, this isn't the place for you. 

The food was overpriced and the drinks seemed reasonably priced. I will not go back to this place."}
{"text":"Fabulous Mexican food with a taste all its own. Great atmosphere whether it's in the dining room , bar area or the patio. Be patient and have an amazing Margarita as this place is understandably busy. Great service especially if you are lucky enough to be seated in Richelle's section."}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food looked much better than it tasted. If you like spicy or traditional Mexican food, avoid this place. Their salsas and enchilada sauces are sweet and have very little to no spice at all. The crazy thing is that this place seems to have a healthy stream of customers each night. It's hard to find good authentic Mexican food in the east valley. We would have rather had Serrano's or Nando's, which isn't saying much."}
{"text":"Five stars for their extraordinary tasting tomatillo salsa, I wish they are selling them in jars! I can't get enough of those! Loved it at first try I will definitely would like to go back for that green salsa they are just insanely awesome :)"}
{"text":"Love this casual Mexican restaurant. Always yummy and large portions for a good price. Service can be iffy but still a worthwhile place to go for great Mexican fare."}
{"text":"Took my family there. The younger kids enjoyed the food from the kids menu. We all enjoyed the chips and salsa as well as the bean dip. I tried the Tilapia Enchiladas with Mole Sauce. It was tasty. Our server was very friendly and helpful. Overall we had an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Every year on my annual trip back to my hometown, I look forward with mouth watering and tummy grumbling to visiting Tia Rosa's (the McKellips Road location). Not only is the food outstanding, best carne asada ever, best seafood tacos, and best salmon enchiladas, but the ambience and decor is top-nothch. The patio and main room are so beautiful and I get my fix of talavera pottery and mexican decor that is lacking in Cincinnati,OH.

Being a spoiled Gilbert native, the trek to McKellips sometimes seems so far, (I laugh now, because driving in Ohio everything is 15-20 minutes, but in Gilbert, you are soooo spoiled) so I was excited to see a new location on Higley Road just a block from home. Yeah!!

Now let's see how it stacks up against the original location!

The decor is still beautiful and they did their best with their space, but not near as gorgeous as the original. However, in comparison to other mexican restaurants, still above par.

The food= equally delicious. Had to get the seafood enchiladas and they were dynamite. I split them with my husband and I wish I ordered my own. They were that good!! Still the best and unique salsa that they give you with the chips. We went through 6 baskets of chips throughout the table and too many to count of the green tomatillo salsa!

My favorite new thing about this location is the fact that they have a soda fountain. The old location only serves plastic bottles of soda and you have to pay for each one. So stupid and annoying. Thank goodness they got it right with this one.  

The price is same as old one. Do not plan on your cheap mexican food because it's not that! It is higher priced grub but you get what you pay for.

Excited that the new one is closer to home, but still may visit the old one for the awesome patio!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here last night for dinner. We just moved to Gilbert, so we are on a mission to find our new \"go-to\" Mexican restaurant. However, this place will not be it. The decorating and ambiance were perfect for a Mexican restaurant, but the margaritas were just average, and we were disappointed to learn that a pitcher of frozen margaritas would be $7 more than a pitcher of non frozen margaritas. We ordered the chicken fajitas and pork enchiladas. The pork enchiladas were just okay not the worst, but not the greatest, but the chicken fajitas were just terrible. Instead of the fajitas coming out to us on a sizzling plate like most Mexican restaurants, they brought them out to us on a cold plate, and when we looked at the chicken and vegetables, we discovered that they were not cooked in a pan or stir fried, they were cooked in a crock pot! This was not acceptable to us, we think they would have tasted much better if they were cooked in a sizzling pan. In conclusion, we have decided this will not be a Mexican restaurant that we will visit again, and we will have to move forward with our search for our new Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"My grandparents love this place.  I think the food and atmosphere is more suited for their style, and not for anyone under 40."}
{"text":"This afternoon was the second time in 9 days we've been there. GREAT Happy Hour menu and prices. Nice people, attentive service. The nacho is huge. Our new \"go to\" place."}
{"text":"I'm sorry...but no thanks.

Growing up in East Mesa, when Tia Rosa's opened it soon (for some reason) became the go-to \"nice\" Mexican spot.  I'm not sure why...the food is about on par or below the standard of most Mexican food that one can other wise find in Mesa.  I don't understand the obsession.

All of my memories of Tia Rosa's are attached to one overriding theme:  Waiting.  On a Tuesday or other week night it is not uncommon to wait over an hour (say an hour and 40 min) for a table.  There really isn't a good area or bar to wait either.  Then it's the waiting for a server to come.  Then it's the LONG wait for food.

Why all the waiting for something that's not even that fantastic??"}
{"text":"Tia Rosa's \"happy hour\" menu Antojitos selections were flavorful and priced to please...  Smoked pork on Nachcos awesome.  Shrimp presentation and BBQ tasty.  However, order 1st and 2nd drinls when you walk in.  Server, was very seasoned and handling multiple tables well.  Come back for \"happy hour\" !"}
{"text":"Oh, Tia Rosa... how you surprise me. With your festive decorations for the holidays, your loquacious patrons sitting nearly side-by-side, your relatively tiny bar area, large and crowded patio and absurdly long wait lines on weekends, I am befuddled as to how I can like you. 

But, no matter how many chips I must munch on before shown to a table, no matter how embarrassingly small your beer selection is (although you do have Dos Equis and Fat Tire), and no matter how I may sometimes be randomly serenaded by your boys with guitars, none of this matters when I peek inside your menu (or even slowly sip a 'rita). I cease to concern myself with trivial matters, like beer selection and wait time. Your menu is vast, proffering fresh fish, including halibut and salmon, as well as a new flair on traditional fare, like the Chicken Mole enchiladas, which I devoured with gusto.

This is a fun place, extremely family-friendly, good for large groups or when you're with a friend or significant other and you're just craving Mexican food without the fire, the typical beans/rice sides and the standard after-dinner heartburn. On weekends, parking can be quite the headache. So, either arrive early or forgo your plans for a week night. 

Bottom line: Tia Rosa's is a must."}
{"text":"Without doubt,  one of the best Mexican restaurants in Gilbert area!  Great service and superb food! My wife had the Chimichana and I had a steak.  Both meals were cooked perfectly.

The happy hour is from 3 to 5 with great prices!  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding!!! Great flavors.. love the chips and salsa. . Service was lacking but for minor infractions because our server had a friendly fun personality. Took forever to get water...  3 requests . . Forever to get food..  no salt on table. ..  no straws with drinks..  and whenever anyone brought something to table it was drop and run off .. no chance to say hey I need....  It just felt like they weren't there to help and serve. Overall place needs a better service vibe. But seriously  loved the food and will go back in hopes of better service."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was not.. our $46.00 bill was ran for $74!!  The waitress only hand written that it was voided. We had to ask for the manager to come out because he wasn't going too!!  He apologized but only gave us free dessert to come back!"}
{"text":"Family favorite! With such an open dining room, they easily accomodate big parties. Excellent chips and salsa and such a friendly staff! Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there to eat lunch. We have never ate there and decided to give it a chance.. We couldn't Have been more pleased the service is great the food was awesome and we can't wait to go back there again."}
{"text":"Wow I am shocked by how good the reviews are for this place. My family and I came here because of the reviews and we were disappointed. All of the salsa was sweet, which is ok but just different. The service was okay until we told the server about the pork being extremely dry, inedible and he said that's how pork is. No offer to fix it or ask if my husband wanted something else. The red sauce has a kick which I liked but for my sons cheese enchilada it was way too spicy for a young child. It would have been nice for the server to forewarn, but my fault since I didn't ask. Food was fast and hot, but very mediocre and the steak in the enchiladas and pork in the carnitas was very dry and lacking in flavor. Beers are overpriced for the small glass, sodas are large. No manager was to be seen. Ordered taquitos for my other son which were made with flour not corn tortillas and they were extremely overcooked and inedible as well. The server offered to do nothing to correct that either and we asked for a manager and one never arrived. We love Mexican food, but this is one place we will never return to again."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! The hostess was polite enough when she informed us that she would not seat our party until all of us were present. There were four out of seven present and nearly all of the tables were empty on a Tuesday at 6pm. We had family in from out of town and wanted to catch up for an hour before the rest of everyone could join us. Once I explained this, the manager returned to again state like a robot that this was just policy. Well Germans had policies about people too, and they were just as inflexible!

This place used to be a great restaurant even a couple months ago. This completely has changed my mind on where to go to get my Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"If you choose just one Mexican restaurant in Mesa, choose this one.  It ranks as one of the best in flavor, authentic food, and decor."}
{"text":"You know this use to be an awesome place. The food is okay and the service is horrible. We set in Jose area, highly recommend you stay away from his area unless you don't mind waiting, and waiting oh and waiting"}
{"text":"Good chips, but if you eat two bowls before they take the order it's slow service and if you eat four bowls before the lunch arrive is a slow kitchen.
We arrived at 2:02 and food delivered at 2:44pm.

We have been here before and had better.  Must be a bad day for them.

Too slow"}
{"text":"We had been here a few times with the prior owners, and thought it was good but over priced. Finally gave it another try, and am so glad we did! The menu looks very similar, but the tomatillio salsa and Carne Asada were amazing (and the hubby is picky!) Even the chips were great, warm and crispy. We finally have a favorite Mexican restaurant. Though the wait for food was long, our awesome server Melissa more then made up for it. If you haven't been for a while, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Attended tonight for dinner.  The place is beautiful, but the compliments ended there.  The salsas were both sweet, like a teaspoon of sugar in the tiny bowl sickly sweet.  I ordered the carne asada, which basically was just foavorless pot roast.  The quac and veggies were fine, beans were okay but similar to canned.  My husband ordered a pork chimi, it was okay but also didn't have much flavor.  Our waiter was lousy.  Drinks took forever to get and then he nebne came to refill them despite them sitting empty.  And he never came back after our food was brought out except to deliver the check.  Worst dining experience anywhere in a long time and horribly disappointing when it was our anniversary dinner.  Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"I literally live a block away from this place and this is the default place to take guests to eat when they're in town.  

They grow their vegetables fresh behind the restaurant and their fresh chips and salsa usually need 3-4 refills before the food comes. :D

Their outdoor seating area is very nice.  Perfect spot to take your dinner date.  Very romantic lighting and heaters when the air gets chilly.  During the daytime, it's a very nice atmosphere to catch up with old friends or have a business lunch with a client.  

I think it's better than Macayo's, Serrano's, and other 'chain/many location' Mexican food places.  The owners keep an eye out for the quality of food they serve here and the always packed parking lot speaks for itself."}
