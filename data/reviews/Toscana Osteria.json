{"text":"as longtime patrons of pomo in scottsdale (both original & new ) and downtown, we looked forward to the new location on 59th ave. this past sunday, june 28, another couple and my wife and myself decided to try the italian restaurant side, toscana osteria. the restaurant was almost empty. the waiter was friendly and took our orders in a timely manner.  everyone ordered either a salad or soup and a main dish. fifteen minutes later, the entrees came out.  they forgot the salads & soup! that was a first for us. never offered to replace the dishes. i had the tagliatelle pasta with a bolognese sauce.  mediocre.  a pile of pasta on a plate. warm on some sides.  hotter on other.  forgettable.  my wife had a ravioli dish.  also just ok. the other couple had a chicken dish and the pasta that i had.  his chicken was a small portion.  no side of either pasta or veggies with the entree. since we didn't have salads, we had room for dessert.  my wife & i shared the molten lava cake.  that was good, although a small portion... when we left, the dining room was still fairly empty. if our experience was typical, they are going to have a tough time making it."}
{"text":"4 stars- really Yelp? This place was overpriced (and I'm not complaining about portions) and overrated because:   - lacking quality: pasta was about $15 a plate, touted as \"homemade pasta.\" I've eaten all over the world and this stodge wasn't homemade. Lies! Sorry no. At least the free bread was good?  - mediocre service: the waiter was smarmy and too lazy to mention the daily special, neglected to provide bread or water refills, and wasn't courteous to the older people in our party. He sure put his smile on when he brought the check over. Again, just no.   Won't be coming back, as fortunately I'm visiting from out of town. Will be sure to tell others not to bother with this restaurant. If I want this sort of bleh factor when I eat,  I'll just hit up Olive Garden. Yelp reviews fail us recently, maybe because stock is plummeting and any friend or random person gets paid to write glowing reviews. Bye, and no thanks!"}
{"text":"More like a 4.5, but since the food is definitely one of the best in the Phoenix area for Italian food, I'm bumping it up to a 5*. So happy it's in this part of town so I don't have to travel to Scottsdale or Arcadia for good Italian food.  Pros 1. Awesome and authentic Italian food 2. Very good wine for only $17 a bottle - I know, I was skeptical too... 3. Location - easy parking, don't have to valet (like in Scottsdale at many restaurants)  Cons 1. Loud - The acoustics are not good for having an easy to hear conversation 2. They should offer a few items from the Pomo pizza side of the restaurant. I understand not being able to sit in the fancier restaurant and only order pizza, but a suggestion would be to at least offer a couple of simple pizzas (i.e. margherita) as an app in the restaurant 3. Portion size - not horribly small, but a tad skimpy on the pasta portion for all of us who got too used to supersize-me portions at most American restaurants.  Overall, it's amazing and can't wait to return. So happy to have great Italian food nearby, let alone in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"A for AUTHENTIC  I am Italian from New York (been here since 1970, though). I've spent time in Italy. My mother is Italian (Isabella Viglucci). My husband is Italian as is his mother (Anna Maria Abruscato). I have not been very happy with many so-called Italian restaurants in the valley and was getting a bit sick of the same old offerings. However, that has changed and on the west side no less.j  A group of 6 of us raved from the beginning to the end of the meal. We passed four different antipastos and 6 different entrees. All delicious and reminiscent of my Nonna's food (Antoinette). The bartender, Christian, prepared a number of special drinks, and each of us ordered a second one. The choice of wine for the table was very good for a restaurant of this size. We enjoyed two bottles of super Tuscans--that were perfect.  The service was impeccable. Our waiter paced the courses perfectly and had a lot of information about the ingredients and cooking style for each of the dishes. He made us feel like family, making obvious the priorities of the owners and management. The manager stopped by our table to make sure everything was wonderful--it was. I loved the rich wood of the room and I was tickled at the red-and-white checkered tablecloths covered by white linen. The bar was stunning and the decor beautiful.   I especially liked the Italian bread with the extra special olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Our basket was replenished without us even asking. Salads were fresh--no brown-edged iceberg lettuce here. The food is not your standard southern Italian fare, (everything covered with red sauce) and each of us remarked that our food was prepared perfectly--not oversauced or salted--a problem at many other restaurants, and something, unfortunately that many of us have gotten used to. No sauce was like another--each perfectly complemented its dish. The meats, poultry, and seafood were cooked just right--they melted in our mouths. It was obvious that the BEST ingredients were used--that olive oil was unlike any I've ever had--and the cuts of meat were just right for the dish as well.  The quantity of food was just enough, especially if  having more than one course. The price was competitive with lesser Italian restaurants in the same area. Ask the server about portion sizes. Inform yourself.  We can't wait to go back,, and go back, and go back--in fact, our goal is to try everything eventually. We are a group of friends who moved into the same neighborhood at the same time who cook and eat out together. We call ourselves (get ready for this) the Tastebuds. We often find ourselves driving downtown or to the east valley, but now we have a great place right here in Glendale.  Finally, we on the west side of town can fulfill our Italian cravings (southern Italian fare and Neopolitan-certified pizza next door at Pomo Pizzeria)  at an authentic, homey and affordable restaurant. We've been waiting for something like this for a long time. When I closed my eyes, I wasn't in Scottsdale--I was in Italy or my nonna's kitchen. If Toscano Osteria disappears because we don't patronize it, we will only have ourselves to blame and many of us will again have to go to the east side to eat a less-than-satisfactory meal at a less authentic restaurant."}
{"text":"We dined at 7 pm on a Friday night and were seated right away. Once word gets out about the awesome food there will definitely be a wait!  Drinks - great Italian wine selections and foreign/ craft beers. I had an Italian charddonay and my wife had a campari soda. Great bartender.   Salad - we shared the Romana insalada. Great take on the caesar salad and loved the generous amount of fresh grated cheese.   Bread - so good and fresh! Delicious with the olive oil and balsamic and we cut ourselves off after one bread basket.   Pasta- we ordered from the fresh pasta selections. The lasagna is AMAZING and they use bechamel sauce instead of ricotta cheese. So creamy and good! My wife ordered the pasta with Bolognese sauce. Very tasty meat sauce with green peas. I loved my lasagna but kept stealing bites of her pasta too.   Everything on the menu looked good and we will be back to try it all."}
{"text":"Best Italian food and pizza! We love this place. As an Italian i can tell that this is the most authentic Italian Pizza and food Glendale has. We will go there as much as possible."}
{"text":"We went looking for Tutti Santi and found that Pomo Pizzeria has purchased this location and has created Toscana.  We had a quick look at the menu before we decided to sit down. We had an attentive server who let us know a little about the history of Pomo and Toscana and shared his enthusiasm about the menu.   There are so many great dishes to choose from, it will take many visits to try them all. My son loved the bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar - the bread was warm with a crisp crust but chewy and delicious inside. We started with the Caprese salad - there were 4 servings of fresh mozzarella, large leaves of basil and salty slices of tomato. Our server brought bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the table so we could dress each serving to our liking. It was served with a ramekin of Italian olives - they were a nice treat with the Caprese. I had the pork limone - my favorite Italian dish is chicken piccata. This was a close second, but I will have it again. My son ordered the lemon-herb chicken and enjoyed the flavor of the lean chicken breast paired with a simple salad all atop a pita. We ordered the lasagna to go for my husband who could t make it to dinner with us. It is made with béchamel sauce rather than ricotta. Of course I had to sample when I got home - the use of béchamel gives the lasagna a smooth, silky feel in your mouth. It was amazing. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the mussels to go (one order red sauce and one order white) and also their seafood pasta dish. Amazing! Loved the fresh noodles and the mussels were delicious, both sauces perfect. We were craving it again the next day after the Fiesta Bowl so we went and dined in. My husband and I each got the seafood pasta. Just as good as the day before, however, the noodles this time weren't house made. They were still great but you could tell they were the packaged kind. We mentioned it to the manager just to ask to be sure we ordered correctly and he mentioned that the chef who is usually there was off for the holiday and apologized. We didn't care much, ate every bite. I understand, it was New Year's Day and I don't expect places to be fully staffed. When we went to pay we saw he gave us a big discount, very nice of him!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! This is authentic Italian. Had the Saltibocca Di Vitella  (veal) best I had so far in North America. Poala was our server and introduced us to some great wines and desserts. Limoncello was awesome."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying this is authentic Italian food served by people from Italy and it is amazing. We went here last night with a large party for a birthday celebration. The entire staff could not have been nicer to us from our server, to the bartender Bailey to Giancarlo (spelling?) the manager/executive chef to the lovely woman named Gaia (spelling?) at the hostess stand. Just wonderful and warm. Now, for the food. They serve amazing fresh made pasta and you can't go wrong with it. Everyone at our table said their meals were excellent. I had the special which was grilled squid, shrimp, and scallop with a pesto sauce. It was fresh and delicious. I also got a side of pasta which was made with a butter or cream sauce with tomato and salmon (I think). It also was fantastic. I had been here one other time and had veal which was great too. Overall, I could not have picked a better place for this celebration and we will be heading back often. You just have to go here and experience the warmth and the fantastic cuisine."}
{"text":"The SECRET is OUT!   Toscana has just opened and now Glendale has Fine North Italian Dining. Toscana shares the same front door as Pomo Pizzeria but has it's own well trained staff, their own bar and separate more formal dining area.   They start you off with crusty bread and olive oil that's studded with dots of balsamic vinegar. We shared a plate of house made gnocchi that was adorned with walnuts and gorgonzola cheese in a light cream. The gnocchi with light and airy and the walnuts were fresh and not bitter. The flavors went together well. For dinner I had the  pistachio crusted salmon. My fish seemed fresh and was prepared well, it was nice and moist. My broccoli was crisp and tasted like it was brushed with olive oil and seasoned just so. Grilled polenta also came with my dish.   My husband had the pollo ripieno. It was a stuffed chicken with prosciutto and fontina cheese in a white wine sauce with sweet corn. The chicken was melt in your mouth tender and that dish was delicious.   Prices were reasonable. Atmosphere was on the loud side and energetic. Glendale has a new destination dining spot! People from Scottsdale might travel to dine here!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful dinner for four (with my wife, son and his girlfriend ).  I had scouted the restaurant this afternoon based on the Yelp reviews and was so impressed with the Italian-born hostess and her presentation for both Tuscana Osteria and Pomo pizzeria that I made a reservation for 7 o'clock.  Service was great from the moment we arrived.  The fresh bread and olive oil were delicious.  Our hostess stopped by, remembered my name from the afternoon visit, then came back with a splendid sampler plate of specialty olive oils for bread dipping, providing an expert description of each one: lemon juice enhanced evoo, oregano pressed, garlic and truffle olive oil (my favorite!) and special balsamic vinegar.  This was just one of the very personalized touches that made our dining experience memorable.  The meal was fantastic!  We each had a salad and one of the entrees.  Plenty of food - we knew we could not go for the whole three or four course meal approach.  The four of us had beef tenderloin, scallops, cioppino, pork tenderloin - EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!  We enjoyed two bottles of the house special wine (featured at only $18 per bottle) to complement the meal.  Nothing was rushed, we had plenty of relaxed conversation.  Now came the best part: After the post-dinner coffees and after the check was already paid...our hostess returned with a desert plate with 4 mini cannolis - a gift from her and the chef to make our evening special!  Trust me, everyone in our party had a great meal and the hostess and our wait staff made it a very special evening out.  I recommend Tuscana Osteria without hesitation and I know you will enjoy it too!"}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance and modern and clean restaurant. Service is very attentive and it's also suitable for large family dining, we had a group of 25 people.  The Penne al Samone is heaven along with the Pollo Della Casa."}
{"text":"This place is a little tucked away inside a shopping plaza but there is nothing else like it on the west side of town for sure. I have been here several times and am a huge fan. My only complaint is that you can't order from both menus and have to choose one side or the other. Sometimes you want pizza and also the carpaccio or cioppino, you know what I mean?  That being said the food is fantastic and transports me to Italy every time."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and service. No wait to be seated in the \"Italian\" side, the pizzeria side looked slightly more busy and both side filled up while we were eating.  The bread was warm and delicious with a wonderful evoo/balsamic vinegar dipping sauce. Decided to get salads since previous reviews mentioned small portion sizes. Salads were fresh and tasty but with a little more dressing than we typically prefer. The pasta dishes were amazing with delicious sauce and good portion size. The pork loin was tender and very thin, good sauce but not very filling. Definitely would recommend one of their homemade pasta dishes. House red wine was reasonably priced and good (at least for us non wine experts!). We will be going back!"}
{"text":"We've become quite familiar with the various Pomo locations over the years, so I was intrigued by this little Italian restaurant that opened up next to Pomo's Glendale location. I'm pretty sure they share the same kitchen, but offer more of a pasta-oriented eating experience (even though Pomo also has pastas). We expected very good things based on our experiences next door.  We were promptly seated, as there were only a few other people in the restaurant itself. We started with some bread, but had to actually request a bottle of olive oil from the server. After using it, the server came back to take it away to give to another table. Another reviewer pointed this out. Apparently, olive oil is scarce? Or maybe I'll just ensure my girlfriend brings one of her larger purses so we can sneak in our own bottle. Jeez!  We ordered the Tortellini Panna Prosciutto and Chicken Della Casa. The Tortellini was okay, but something seemed way off on the chicken. Whatever cheese they used on the chicken completely overtook the entire entree. The Tortellini was a little better. For sides, we ordered mashes potatoes, which were essentially just that. I guess I was expecting at least a little flare? Maybe we've been spending too much time in steakhouses? I also ordered a polenta, which I absolutely loathed. Although I take responsibility for that one, due to our mutual hatred of gorgonzola cheese    For dessert, they appear to have a combination of Pomo desserts, along with some that aren't available on the Pomo menu. Not that it should make a difference since they're in the same location, right? Anyway, we opted for the Lava del Vesuvio. It ended up being embarrassingly small and something we finished off in a matter of seconds.       Since we didn't finish our food, we asked for a box. The serve put up a big stink about us taking the bread with us. Apparently, it's only for the restaurant. Seriously? What are they going to do? Take it back into the kitchen so they can re-serve it to another customer? Ultimately, we escaped with the stolen slices of bread, as the server suggested we just slip it into our box - but he assured us that he would take no responsibility if the manager caught us burgling his bread.    We came here in July and there's been several good reviews since then, so we might give it a second chance when a pasta mood strikes us and we don't feel like driving further south. But unless they've made some significant improvements, I can't really make a recommendation at this point."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here a week ago. The atmosphere was pleasant, the service was spot on, and the pasta we ordered was cooked perfectly and the accompanying sauces were delicious.  Definitely would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been here a few times now and love the atmosphere and food. The service hasn't always been wonderful, but I will continue coming despite that. A few of the dishes I have tried are:  Insalata Romana Arancini Carpaccio di Manzo Tagliatelle Bolognese Strozzapretti con Salsiccia Lasagna Pollo della Casa  Everything has been wonderful and I can't wait to continue going back to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"I guess my experience was not as good as others. I was first slightly taken aback when told this was \"fine\" dining when the table was covered in a checkered plastic tablecloth.  I ordered my drink and the soda water was flat. Took two tries to get some effervescent soda water. I ordered the bruschetta and the bread was tough and inedible. I could barely bite through it. Shame on the chef to let that be served. My husband ordered the seafood special (clams, calamari, mussels)  and I ordered the steamed mussels. The seafood special didn't even come with any pasta and we were charged to have barely a cup of pasta in the dish. My mussels were ok, but very skimpy portions on both meals for the price. Best thing was the dessert. Unfortunately we will not go back as this was far from fine dining in my book."}
{"text":"The food at Toscana is marvelous.  I tried Mini Meatball and Panzerotti for appetizers. The red sauce or marina had a freshly made taste. I liked that the meatballs were served with fresh basil.  The sauce left me wanting more.  Also, I sampled the Spinaci salad.  It has a baby spinach with crumbled gargonzola, pear slices, walnut and a tasty raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  Plus, I sampled the Tortellini Panna Prosciutto. This dish was served in a light cream sauce with prosiutto and parmigiano. The flavors of the ingredients blended to create an enjoyable and wonderful flavor.  I would recommend this restaurant if you can spend a bit and want to enjoy a delightful evening in a nice Itallian restaurant with a pleasing atmosphere.  Toscana is only open for dinner starting at 5:00pm. The bartender was from Italy and very interesting. However, the neighboring pizza place named Pomo is open earlier; starting for lunch time."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal, wonderful people. When I showed up an hour before they opened I was welcomed in without the blink of an eye. The owner was a complete gentleman and the wait staff treated my girlfriend and I like we were old friends. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually the picky type with food. I have never had the feeling that I should send food back in a restaurant. However, this establishment has created a new low for me. First of all, the food took more than 45 minutes to arrive. Our waiter in that time took a bottle of olive oil and vinegar to give to another table. Does this restaurant have only one bottle that has to be shared among all its patrons?!? When the food did arrive, it was bland as can be or just super lemony. There was no attention to detail in terms of taste. Either the scallopini was doused in just lemon or the pork chop tasted like flavorless chicken with no seasoning. The serving size was incredibly small. I understand some restaurants have small portions but they usually make a trade off with an impeccable taste. This place had neither good food nor decent serving sizes. I hope the owners see this review and consider making an alteration with the cooking staff. As of right now, this restaurant cannot be recommended."}
