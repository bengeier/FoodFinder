{"text":"One of my most fav places. Their T-bone is the best. The owner- Mahmood is a very nice and humble person, so are his employees. Starting with their complementary soup, then meat platters with green chilli hot sauce, a sip of mango/ grapefruit juice, and lastly a cup of refreshing tea... All together, an awesome experience every time we go there."}
{"text":"Authentic Somali food is heaven! Too bad they didn't have Goat rib when we went (heard so much good things about this), but the T-bone and the beef stew were to die for. Staff was very friendly in explaining the food they have. Boy, I'd come to this place again!   Just be careful when asking for spicy varieties. Spicy is REALLY spicy (e.g spicy vegetable mix)!"}
{"text":"What can we say??? Really good restaurant! If not for the service alone but the food was delicious and the portions gigantic!  Each meal comes with a meat, rice, bit of salad, yummy mango juice, and to top it off tea!  Service was friendly and hospitality on point.. We will come here again definitely! (we ordered the beef and chicken stew dinners Btw... Delicious!)"}
{"text":"So good, it keeps us coming back every week! What can i say...the portion sizes are huge....staff is extremely friendly...and the prices are very affordable.   I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to try a different type of food...with spices/flavours we usually dont get to try here in Canada.   Keep up the great work Sahan!"}
{"text":"First time eating at a Somali restaurant. The service was friendly and the food was delicious.   I had the steak and rice dish and I will be coming back again to try the lamb and rice!   I love Scarborough for these authentic cuisine gems!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night for dinner. The people who work at the restaurant were very friendly. Food came out quickly and was delicious. It was my first time having Somalian food.   As everyone has mentioned, the lentil soup was delicious! I ordered the goat fal fal and had the spicy sauce on the side. I ended up using a lot of it. The portion was huge! I also had the mango juice. Sadly we couldn't stay for the tea that comes with the meal because we were running late for a movie. Overall great experience and good service!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. The service was superb.. Got the T-Bone Steak, the price was definetly worth it. Will come again"}
{"text":"We ate T-bone steak at this place !! It was delicous and will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I came to Toronto for vacation and was looking for a good Somali restaurant. I found two Somali restaurants by Toronto airport but I was not impressed with the food. I called a friend who connected me with his friend that is a local in Toronto. The new friend introduced me to Sahan. We had rice sport with goat and steak. We started with soup. The food was delicious and taste like home food. Non Somalis I recommend you try this place. My friend suggested I try T-bone when I return."}
{"text":"Simple Somalian home style restaurant near Lawrence East and Warden. It's a very popular place with both Somalians and Middle Eastern people. Nice spacious area and friendly service.  I ordered the Somali suqaar ($15), a dry beef stew served with a side salad and basmati rice. Pretty filling and tasty with their hilac spicy sauce; however, the beef could have been tender and moist but it is what it is. The meal also came with lentil soup which was good, large glass of juice (mango or grapefruit) & finished with a fragrant Somali tea, similar to masala chai.  It's a family oriented establishment where groups were sharing family size platter of food."}
{"text":"Talk about value for money! Each entree comes with 1 flavorful soup, refreshing mango juice (1 per person) and spiced tea (unlimited). My husband and I shared the beef stew with salad and rice (pasta is also an option) for $15 and we were stuffed! We finished off with the famous Somalian Tiramisu ($6.99) which was a generous portion of sponge cake soaked in milk topped with icing. It reminds me of the Latin dessert tres leches. Overall I would highly recommend this place. Service was good, tables were clean and most importantly the food came quick."}
{"text":"I actually finally discovered this place a while ago; perhaps 3 or 4 months now. The only reason I found it is because Yelp had suggested it and more so because there had been a number of Yelp elites who wrote glowing reviews.  Thank you Yelp! You helped me find what is now pretty much my favorite restaurant in Toronto! I have been back at least a half-dozen times since finding it.  Sahan is a Somali place and so the food is some mix of North African and Middle Eastern in style.  What's more important is that the food is clearly made with passion! The owner is always working the floor together with a small crew of people. The place isn't particularly nice aesthetically and so far this winter it has consistently been too cold. That being said, the food is SO SO SO good that these little complaints melt away in your mind as you are brought to sheer joy with every bite!  Sahan is a Goat/Lamb/Meat lovers paradise! Are you noticing how many !s I've been using so far?  The portions are huge, the food is amazing, no matter what you order. you will get a free soup that is made from the juices of the meat mixed with lentils, water, and spices. You also get a free drink; either mango or grapefruit juice. Finally, there is Somali cardamom tea brewing all the time on the bar that you self-serve as much as you'd like after the meal.  If you are reading this review, have never been here, and enjoy meat/goat, you owe it to yourself to drive over RIGHT NOW!"}
{"text":"Very very good meal and excellent service. They were so friendly and warm, I felt like I was eating at someone's home.  My brother and I came here for dinner. First of all, every meal comes with a lentil soup and tea at the end. The lentil soup is fantastic. It's the perfect start to the meal. The tea is a perfect finisher: sweet and spiced with cardamom and ginger. I should start making this at home.  We ordered the goat ribs with rice and beef steak with the flat bread, plus some spicy mixed veggies on the side.   Goat ribs: I've never even heard of these before (I mean, I know that goats have ribs, but I've never had them served up this way). They were SO GOOD. Tender and perfect. Just perfect. The rice was really good as well.  Beef steak: Very good, but got a little chewy as it cooled. The flat bread was amazing, though and the perfect accompaniment for pretty much everything. The flatbread is also dairy-free. Yay!!  Spicy mixed veggies: I asked for hot sauce and they recommended this: a mix of saut√©ed onions, bell peppers and scotch bonnet peppers. It was super tasty and added the heat I wanted (especially the chunks of scotch bonnets)  An excellent meal. I'll definitely return to try this T-bone everyone's going on about."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent services. Every dish comes with soup, mango and tea. Tried their Goat falfal, t-bone streak, chicken and beef stew. It was well marinated and cooked. I was impressed with the rice as well. This is my 4th time going as well. My parents also loved the food, despite being very used to with Bengali food."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my meal at Sahan today.  I've enjoyed Kal & Mooy, Xawaash, and Hamdi, and this place is up there for taste.  I had the goat fal fal, a massive platter with several large pieces of tender slow cooked bone-in goat pieces, well seasoned and surrounded by salad and a massive portion of flavourful rice mixed with fried diced onions, etc.  I asked for spicy, and the kitchen complied--a good amount of heat, but not so much that the flavour was overpowered.  The meal started with a savoury lentil soup accompanied with a bowl of their in-house green chili sauce, which spiked up the somewhat plain soup, and a large glass of mango juice (my choice, pineapple was also available).  The chili sauce was great with the main dish as well, and was only slightly less fresh tasting than the one I'd had at Xawaash (with their excellent samosas).  All in all, I kept eating simply because it was so delicious and somehow managed to finish the entire meal, but to be honest I could probably have eaten half, been satisfied, and saved the rest for a very large lunch tomorrow.  For $17 all in, this was a fantastic value proposition.  Somali food is my favourite craving right now, and since Kal & Mooy on Queen closed, this is the closest option for me.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best T bone I ever had:)  Food was really good. All Items I have are freshly made and served with smile  I will be visiting them quite often.  I suggest to give a try"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!  Tbone steak and chicken leg dinners are amazing!  Love the lentil soup and finish evrything off with their Tiramusu and Chai Tea"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Sahan. The food is simply amazing. I am afraid I am already addicted."}
{"text":"Sahan is the perfect restaurant to try Somalian food.   The hostess/waitress greeted us and sat us at a comfortable booth. She was very patient and explained the menu items to us. We decided on the T-bone steak for me and Goat Fal Fal for hubby. All meals come with juice, lentil soup, salad and tea.   When the lentil soup arrived it looked very plain and unappealing but looks can surely be deceiving. The lentil soup was rich and flavorful and when we added a little bit of the green hot sauce that came with it, it was out of this world! Our dishes came out pretty quick and man did it look delicious. The Goat Fal Fal was a little gamey for me but hubby enjoyed it. The T-bone steak was fine, nothing spectacular. What I enjoyed the most was the fragrant rice that came with it. Everything went well together and the flavors were harmonious, I even enjoyed the cooked onions and tomatoes that topped my steak.   After our meal we had the complimentary tea. Somalian tea has a number of different spices mixed in like cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and even black pepper but everyone has their own recipe. They make their own tea here and add in their own blend of spices; it was very aromatic and a delicious way to end our meal.   Portions are large and I was more than happy to take home the left overs."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and cleanliness.  Second time at this restaurant and it's T Bone Steak is AMAZING!!!!!  Merry xmass"}
{"text":"This was an amazing meal. We stopped on our way through town. We ordered the T-Bone to share. They served us quickly. It was very tender and full of amazing flavor. I am adding this to my favorites and will be back. Thank you."}
{"text":"A steak that will beg you to come back for it, but your stomach will not forgive for such a big meal. Their serving size is HUGE! the T-Bone steak with rice is A-Mazing, please keep in mind that this would not be a typical italian stake, Somalis cook it differently and its not very saucy, but the meat is marinated and cooked so it has a really good taste. The soup served before it is good too. Just keep in mind to go there when you are really hungry, or else you would probably not be able to finish your food, the best part, it's not very expensive."}
{"text":"Blessed up fam. Meat melted in yo damn mouths. One of the best places if not the best. Shit was tiiiiiiight. Mango juice, unbelievable. Rice and salads outstanding. The soup they start you off with brings you back home. I highly recommend this place, superb jobs guise."}
{"text":"Ordered the goat ribs. Extremely fatty and barely edible.  Service was super friendly but I can't even justify a 3 star review based on that.   The meat was so fatty that it was hardly edible. I was disappointed by my first Somalian review but it is what it is.   Don't order the goat ribs. There's too much fat on them which makes it inedible."}
{"text":"First time trying Somalian food and was most impressed by the great hospitality of our server. He was quick, responsive and always smiling despite dealing with a large group on his own. The starter soup was delicious, and was a good indication to the quality of the upcoming meal. Being in a larger group, I got to sample a large part of the menu. My top picks would be the chicken leg, goat ribs, and the T-bone steak. The meats didn't come with any sauces but they were well marinated and cooked to perfect tenderness. For added spice, there is always the green hot sauce to try out. The serving size tends to be large, so expect plenty of left overs!!"}
{"text":"There is something wonderful about going back to one's African roots and partaking in familiar food from the Motherland, prepared with finesse.  Takes me right back to my youth.  If someone asked me what I would wish my last meal on earth to be, it would be this place.  You start with a lamb/lentil type broth with the lamb flavour in the background, which, in itself, is amazing and gets your appetite going.  The suqqar (stew) ... chicken or beef is tender, rich in flavour, marinated with perfectly balanced spices and prepared with love.  You can ask for it to be mild, medium or spicy, we go for the spicy.  There are what appear to be Scotch bonnet peppers in the beef.  The rice - fluffy, long-grained and prepared with saffron.  The presentation - amazing.  The cardamon tea - goes so well with the meal.  The service at this place is amazing.  The owner is a gracious and welcoming host.  We don't go here often enough as it is far from where we live.  Worth the drive - go there!  You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Very delish! The lamb fal fal is awesome. I like the lamb lentil soup. The rice was very flavourful. The Somali tiramisu is very tasty and huge. Careful though, their hot sauce and hilac (spicy veggies) are really spicy. Would come back again for their sport (sharing) plates!"}
{"text":"We ordered basically whatever the chef told us was popular lol.  The chicken and beef platter was really good. I think we liked the beef more than the chicken but honestly to me I could have either or again. The meat was cooked perfectly. I like my beef a little chewy which it was. The food came out very fast, within 10 minutes. It was reallllly hot which I like, I hate when food is served just warm. I liked the way it was served in a nice traditional looking plate.  I really didn't like the soup, it had an odd taste to it with the lentils and lamb.   I didn't try anything else but mango juice, seems like it was watered down but next time I'll try the mango shake because I heard that was good."}
{"text":"I like the setting of the restaurant. Will recommend having their t bone, chicken or beef stew but don't order their king fish! The waiter was friendly but doesn't write your order down and either brings wrong food or forgets your order.! Will probably recommend someone to try it out."}
