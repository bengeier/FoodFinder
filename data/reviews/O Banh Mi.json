{"text":"Great sandwiches and the cheapest sandwich option in the junction. Better than downtown banh mi with a lot more toppings."}
{"text":"I like Vietnamese sandwiches but let's be honest...it's not rocket science. So watching the staff here ponderously make sandwiches at a rate of about 10 an hour - at 12:30, their peak lunch time - is painful to behold. So slow. Banh Mi Boys kill them on speed and service and I think they're doomed unless they can speed up the delivery of these tasty but dirt-simple sandwiches. The Junction is competitive."}
{"text":"How excited was I to find that a Banh Mi restaurant opened close to us?!?!  The House Special (my favourite) is $3.95 and chock full of fixings, love the coriander and Vietnamese sausage!  Fresh juices seem to cost more than the sandwiches (a little bit strange) but are good - I ordered the watermelon juice, which was as advertised and refreshing.  Service is quick, staff are friendly.  There are a few seats inside the restaurant, and a tiny patio (one or two seats outside)"}
