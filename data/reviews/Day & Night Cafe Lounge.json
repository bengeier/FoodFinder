{"text":"The hours are all over the place. Half the time I go there, the lights are turned off and the place is closed when it's supposed to be open.  They no longer have a working kitchen. (Soooo disappointing, because their menu was really delicious).   When Day & Night first opened, I thought it had so much potential ... but at this point I don't even know how it's going to stay open.  Too bad really."}
{"text":"Or not - this place looks to be closed.... OR perhaps undergoing renovations?  Hang tight!"}
{"text":"Day & Night no longer has a functioning kitchen!  BOOO!  So they don't serve meals anymore...just bagels, drinks, and a small selection of desserts.  The server said the menu retraction had to do with zoning issues (?).  I'm afraid this change will be the coup de gr√¢ce for an already suffering (i.e., perpetually empty) restaurant."}
{"text":"Not sure what the other reviews on here are on about. I've been here many times, and enjoyed it pretty much every time. My recommendation? The cheesecake. Oh my god, it's delicious.  The last time I was here I met Nate, who is taking the restaurant over from it's current owners and has grand plans for it. I'm excited to see where he takes it. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because I think he can improve the menu to that point. Check it out!"}
{"text":"A friend told me to go here so I did. It's a new place under the 80 Western Battery condo. It's new and quiet, I was the only customer there when I went today.  The ambiance is nice and place is well decorated and clean. There are main tables in the front for everyone and also a hidden section for some privacy on the side. Had the Black Forest and Brie Panani, it was good, big and juicy, couldn't finish the whole thing. Also had a latte which was also good.  Overall it's a good place to work and quiet (for now, until it gets busy?). Also there's free street parking which is nice. Good place to go to for people who live in the buildings."}
{"text":"If all you want is a QUIET place to have a drink or a coffee, or maybe a sandwich in a box they bought from another store, this is the place for you.  The food was disgusting and the place is always empty.....I wonder why."}
