{"text":"They have a website and a menu as well, kudos! Prices? NO? Duh?"}
{"text":"Great staff, amazing and made fresh hot dosa's. Cater to all level of spice palate. most of the time rice dishes are not available which is an easy go for my lil one :)..but he loved indian crispy paratha (Dosa)."}
{"text":"This place used to be good....but the food wasn't all that good anymore... Explains why it's not very busy"}
{"text":"Good food and service, i wish restaurants would make 4 or 5 different sambhars, god i miss good sambhar."}
{"text":"Taste of dosa was usual, they need to really bump up customer service! 
Closing before posted time, not having all dishes, space issue and person on cashier who simply needs to be retrained on customer service: 
I went there three times only Becuz that's only south India restaurant in area. 
Please don't try chats, not worth it"}
{"text":"Went with our two kids for lunch, we were the only one at the restaurant, we found the tables were not cleared and cleaned and dirty, the waiter cleaned the table immediately.

We ordered Masala dosa and cheese Dosa for the kids, waiter brought the masala dosa instead of cheese dosa, when we told the waiter he just said \"what's the problem just take out the masala\" we insisted on bringing a cheese dosa and finally the kids got the dosa.

At the end we were charged for the waiters mistake as apparently the manager told him :). He kept saying arguing about the bill, we just paid and will never return.

Food quality: It's average,
Restaurant: Dirty
Service : Poor"}
{"text":"If you're from South India, stay away from this restaurant - you'll only be enraged. 

If you're trying South Indian food for the first time, stay away as well - South Indian food tastes nothing even remotely close to what they serve here. The idly looked and felt like it was taken right out of the freezer. The Sambhar, though really was in the rasam consistency, clearly was prepared using the MTR ready to eat mix. One would think Chutney Swamy's signature dish is Chutney - it's probably true - they did have an assortment of colourful chutneys, but they all tasted the same. We were terribly hungry, and they made us wait 30 mins for two dosas. We did order quite a bit of food, but we weren't able to finish it as we had lost our appetite - I'm sorry to say this, but the food was awful. 

On a positive note, the toilet was very clean - the absence of customers explains it - we were the only ones in the restaurant. 

I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless the owners take some serious measures to improve the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE! Worst Dosas in town. Most of the employees work under the table and the owners steal all their given tips. I would never go there again. UNETHICAL, bad quality food, and dirty cutlery."}
{"text":"I have no idea why these guys received such low rating. Their dosa and service is excellent! I had their paneer spring dosa. It was healthy and not crazy spicy. The seating area is very nice with highly professional service"}
{"text":"I am a dosa lover and this place serves a variety of dosa. Their food is always fresh and service is always quick.I have been to many south Indian restaurants in GTA but i think chutney Swamy serves the best dosa.Ghee roasted paper masala dosa and Mysore masala dosa is my fvrt."}
{"text":"Beware the parking lot construction.. they are open but you need to walk around from the back to get to the entrance.

Small place, simple service with 1 staff plus kitchen.  Their menu was pretty big considering.   I'm sure it's a great place for Dosas but they also have good Bombay Street Foods like pani puri, pav bhaji, chaat and samosa.

I had the channa bhatura which was pretty tasty and quite a big portion. Not too spicy and fresh.

Worth a try if you like or are craving this type of food!"}
{"text":"This place definitely needs to tidy up. The serving trays are white plastics and if it becomes evident when they are not clean enough. The food is okay - there's enough choices. However, the quantity seems less but could be okay for the prices."}
{"text":"Was out early on a Saturday looking for breakfast. Decided on something other than pancakes and over-easy eggs. Settled for Chutney Swamy due to proximity to home and keeping up with the lazy weekend mood. 
I knew what I was going to order. This being a South Indian restaurant, it had to be a dosa. There was a buffet available too. 
The dosa came in almost cold. The accompanying chutneys and sambar were okay. But they add little value if the dosa is itself not enjoyable. Add to this that the dosas being served on the buffet were exactly the same as those ordered from the menu. Not satisfying at all. 
The price being charged for this kind of food adds to the feeling of insatiety.
Next time, im going to skip the laziness and drive a little further."}
{"text":"Not sure about this place, seems to be heading downhill. For today's brunch, the air conditioning vent was dripping water, dosa pieces were strewn on the ground and the waiter seemed reluctant to clean it when we wanted to use the table. Sambar was luke warm and the dosas leathery. Remember this place being better."}
{"text":"I'll keep this review short. I walked in. And the smell was like a bathroom. The floor wasn't even mopped. I walked right out. I don't recommend this hole"}
{"text":"OMG hire more people!

Went here for lunch, party of 4. The restaurant was packed and there was one server. 

So we ordered 4 apps and 4 dosas. The food as always is exceptional. Love their dosas and chilly pakoras. They aren't badly priced to, at $10.00 for a dosa. If the review was for food only I would give them 5 stars. However, it isn't, it's for the experience.

One server, serving an entire restaurant and it wasn't pretty. Drinks confused or forgotten, 15 minutes for dessert and one forgotten, cutlery thrown at you, dirty spoons, filthy floors, the list goes on and on. We understand this is not the Ritz but for chrisssakes get another server. The poor guy was run off his feet. We left him a sizable amount for his trouble, after all it wasn't his fault, he was moving as fast as he possibly could.

Go here if you have an hour and a half to spare for what essentially should be fast food and be cautious of the spices, food can get really hot here (in a good way)"}
{"text":"Entire clan went here for dinner, craving Dosas. The place was very clean and the staff was all very friendly as well. 
I ordered the paper dosa, which was pretty good. The masala mix was ok, didn't taste as good as I expected. The sambar was pretty good too. The chutneys were very good. Loved the coconut chutney. 
For the price the place was ok. Nothing too special."}
{"text":"OMG! I can't believe this place is so close to home and it never came up on any search for me!

I've eaten in and taken out here. Eat in is far superior. Tasty dosas and all the accompaniments. Fully veg. Great spot!"}
{"text":"I visited chutney swammy last week we ordered on weekend buffet and two dosas off the menu the 
cheese and garlic dosas was too salty and the complimenting sambar was just not up to par. In a South Indian restaurant sambar is key.
The pav bhaji dosa on the other hand was very good great flavour dosa was nice and crispy.
They only had one server up in the front which lead to poor service times the server was prompt and worked hard just could not help everyone in a timely manner.
P.S we got the masala tea at the end of the meal and it tasted amazing."}
{"text":"I give a 2 star rating for the poor attitude of the manager. You truly spoilt my evening by your facial expression and attitude! I ordered a puri with  kesari; you brought out a cold-warm flat puri without the Kesari. I requested you to bring the kesari after 3-4 minutes as the puri was already lukewarm and flat rather than freshly prepared and you made a face at me and then annoyingly got out the kesari which was quite a mess ie some outside serving bowl. You need to learn manners and etiquette in service industry!"}
{"text":"Food is mostly ok though pricey, however service is atrocious. I promised myself that I would not go there after last couple of times were let downs. Again today had to go there due to convenience. A disinterested waiter, total lack of hospitality knowledge, lack of cutlery on the table, spicy food when it should not have been and no apologies to top it. No wonder there were so few customers even on a weekend."}
{"text":"Crispy dosa, crunchy platter , lovely foolodas and chana bhaturas cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"A cozy little dosa place in the Erin Mills Town Centre area. I came here a few times before this year and absolutely loved it. Went here again on Friday and it just wasn't the same. The food seemed to be at least three times spicier than before and the quality just wasn't the same. Oddly, the channa bhaturas were the best part. We ordered those after we tried three different dosas and gave up. Quite disappointed that their quality went so far downhill. The mango smoothies also aren't worth it.. A very small cup for about $5."}
{"text":"This place is very underrated. There are so many factors to consider when rating a restaurant. 
I have been there a least a dozen times over the last couple years. I am comparing it directly to other dosa places in Mississauga. 
The food is always fresh and point. We usually go there for dosas mainly. The chutneys are very good and you can always have extra chutneys for no extra charge. You can also customize your dosas with the amount of oil and crispiness. The food is always made to order and arrives within 5 mins. 

It is true that there is only one server. To be fair, with the increase in minimum wage, little places lime this struggles to operate. I don't mind the one server and he does a damn good job. Just be a little patient. I'll rather wait for my bill or a napkin than have water down food or a poor quality dosa. 

It is the only dosa place in the neighbourhood - Erin Mills. If you don't want to drive far and is craving a GOOD dosa, then it is the place. The decor and ambiance not that of a luxury restaurant, rather a fast place to get some good dosas."}
{"text":"Order placed around 9:16 pm, got called from skip the dishes and they applogized that restaurant won't be able to process order because they are closing. Before you go or order just mekesure you call them first so they can assure you whether they decided to accept orders or just wants to kill your time!!!"}
{"text":"I'VE DIED AND GONE TO DOSA HEAVEN!!!!!!  A friend of mine took me here, and I ordered the Rava Dosa with Onion and Potato - SO DELICIOUS.  The portion sizes were massive and really tasty.  Prices were super reasonable.  No hipsters in sight, just people there to enjoy great food.  Service was a bit slow and the waiter was sassy, but it/he wasn't awful.  I will come here again!"}
{"text":"Service is great, as usual. But I think they may have a new chef. The food was salty to an extent that it was hard to taste the flavors. Hope they can fix this soon. I do like this place."}
