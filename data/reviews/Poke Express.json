{"text":"Learned about the establishment by chance.  I went to the Craig location and was blown away by the quality of the poke.  I was so stoked when I learned that they have a South location. The customer service is superb and you can sample all the different poke. Personally I like the spicy ahi poke, salmon with special sauce. This is definite must try"}
{"text":"I stopped in early Tuesday about 11. The two people helping out were more than generous with their time and encouraging me to try the selections. After trying 8 or so selections I went with the most popular, however each one brought a burst of flavor and would have been great. I ate my lunch in the car too excited to wait along with the salad. The customer service was so kind and the food was so great there is nothing to offer but five stars!"}
{"text":"Love poke express! Lived down the street from the location on Craig and revere since they opened. And now that I live on the southeast right next to their new location off Stephanie and 215... Finally got my poke fix! From my favorite peoples at that!"}
{"text":"Poke is super delicious and fresh tasting. This place is hella expensive tho. Basically $15 per pound. My wallet is crying"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat at while in Vegas!  I love poke, and eating here, if you can get off the strip, beats anything you can find on the strip, especially the price. Everything is fresh (as it can be with it in the desert and all), and everyone has always been very helpful. You can always try samples of everything and the portions are great for different occasions ( picnic for one, multiple styles for a big appetite or more than one). 

 My first love here is the kim chee tako. I can make it a lunch by getting a pint and a water, or get a seperate quarter to half pint of seaweed salad as a compliment. My next favorite is the salmon, and I ask for them to add onions and shoyu sauce for extra flavor. This doesn't take away from tasting the flavor of the fish, with the onions giving a different texture.

Overall, a must visit for the poke lover. Can't be beat!!!"}
{"text":"Yummmy yummmy yummmy, I love coming here for my poke fixing whenever im in the north town. Everything is so fresh and tasty here, I could never get enough of it. I love the variety at poke express( limu,wasabi,soyu,spicy and garlic) so theres alwayse something for everyone. I can eat poke all day everyday lolz, as long as I have some rice! Everytime i drop in i'll usually pick up a couple pounds of limu poke and limu tako to eat at home and work. Anyways if your looking for delicious poke make sure you come to poke express, YOU GONNA LOVE IT !"}
{"text":"Delicious poke at very reasonable price. I tried a couple of things and ordered 1/4 of the ahi poke limu, spicy poke and crabmeat salad. Love all three of them and I can't wait to try to the other ones on my next visit! Also, friendly and great customer service!"}
{"text":"No need to travel to Hawaii... This is the real deal! Did the all-you-can eat lunch. Lots of items to choose from and well worth it for only $22 per adult. Sushi, poke, chicken dishes were all great. Malasadas were soft and light. Haupia cake and Chantilly cake were mouth watering! Aloha spirit with every interaction of the staff! I will make this a necessary stop for all my upcoming Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"Poke is on point. Premarinated is the way to go and there's no other spot that I know of that does that in vegas. My boyfriend is from the big island and loves it. Lots of variety. I just feel like the staff is a bit cold. I feel like I'm bothering them every time I go in there. If they were warmer and friendlier this place would be 5 stars. Also, I wish they would add some sort of seating outside so you can eat your food there."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owners are nice and friendly. The poke is perfect for not being close to the ocean. Wasabi Ahi is the thing to get if you like that wasabi kick. Kimchi crab is also great too and the shell is soft too. The best part is its close to me so I try to go every week. Yup the poke is that good."}
{"text":"From the service, to the fresh selection, and to the prices... This place nails greatness all around. They mix the poke fresh with each order... Many different combinations to choose from... The lunch poke bowls are what many can describe as get it while its available! Because as soon as he runs out of rice your just stuck with the fish lol... But awesome awesome awesome... 

You kinda have to question how the hell this guy has some of the freshest selection of seafood in the middle of the desert valley!"}
{"text":"fresh poke awesome people, as good as you can get in las vegas! love the spicy avocado poke!"}
{"text":"Good customer service but the food is another subject. The kaula pork is marginal, needs more flavor and spice. With a few Hawaiian restaurants around the Las Vegas-area, they need to step up the quality to get a better review..."}
{"text":"i come here as often as i can, its so good, very fairly priced, young man at the counter is great to deal with!"}
{"text":"Always fresh & friendly! My haole husband is also addicted!! He's there buying poke twice a week!"}
{"text":"Best Poke on da 9th island hands down (chopsticks up)."}
{"text":"Ten stars! First Poke experience and I had to fly from Texas to get it. They literally gave me about 15 samples. The described just about every dish and answered every question I had. Walked over to a Hawaiian cafe to order some rice and munched out. They have no tables strictly to go."}
{"text":"Excellent food but employees are not friendly ,today almost 9 pm half seccion its close mopping earlier store closes at 10.30 pm not good idea"}
{"text":"if there is a silver lining to the sad fact that too much of the best sashimi grade fish in the pacific gets sucked up by casinos to shove down the throats of gluttonous fat cats from dubai and nyc and hong kong, poke express deserves the honor.

i wouldn't have known to visit this joint except that it got a perfect 5 star rating on yelp. you can imagine how disappointed i was to find a storefront appointed with a exactly a deli case, a few hawaii travel posters and a couple strapping something-teen young dudes working the counter. they leisurely interrupted the conversation they were having in a lazy pidgin with a couple other islanders, one of whom was the size of a volkswagen and who couldn't stop smiling if his life depended on it. 

\"you like poke bruh? it's raw fish ya know.\" 

i told them i did in fact love poke but that i had no idea there were so many kinds (they offer about 8). they let me try the lot of them. the limu and the chili water were the clear winners, so i grabbed a half a pound of each for less than hat i'd expect to pay for a custard dish full at a sit down joint in SoCal. 

the hiyashi wakame was a steal at $5 a pound, so i grabbed a bunch of that too. the raw wasabi tako is one of the most delightful things i have ever had the pleasure to taste. needless to say, the wasabi was real and not this green horseradish paste that virtually every sushi place gobs on your plate. 
 
they had no tables, no plates, no rice, nothing. they did kindly refer me to the teriyaki joint next door who were virtually empty and only to happy to sell me a plate of rice and veggies, thus giving me a place to scarf down my ahi and octopus. that's good neighbors

how good was it? let me just say that before my visit to the poke express, i had no idea i could come in my own mouth. now i know i don't need to take my clothes off to do it.

like the sign on the wall say:
 \"IF CAN, CAN. IF NO CAN, NO CAN\"

poke express definitely found a way, carry on island dudes. carry on."}
{"text":"Seriously.. the best poke in town. Their new location in Island Sushi is uber convenient vs. driving to N. LV for their original location.

They have various types of poke including pipikaula and dried aku.

Their spicy tuna is broke da mout!! Big chucks of ahi, not the ground up crap you find everywhere else. The spicy salmon is just as ono too! No joke.

I've tried a bunch of their pokes. The shoyu, limu and wasabi ahi are among some of my faves. They use fresh limu, not the crappy dehydrated stuff. 

They're reasonably priced at about $10/lb. Man, you go to International Market Place and you are paying almost $15/lb and they only have poke on certain days. 

Poke Express is a definite fave whenever I'm craving some really good and fresh poke! Not to mention you can get an awesome plate lunch at Island Sushi while you are there too!"}
{"text":"I walked in and it was empty. The 2 guys were soo nice. They offered me samples
And even made my spicy poke extra spicy (; the poke was amazing! I had 1/3 lb of sea weed salad, 1/3 lb of spicy tuna and avocado, 1/2 lb of salmon with special
Sauce on the side. And a side of rice. All for $17. By the time I left there were
Atleast 10 people in there. Now I know
Why, best poke in town !!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Poke is so good here, totally makes me feel like I'm back in Maui.  Really impressed with how fresh the fish is and perfect with the Maui onions. I always will stop here when I'm in Henderson."}
{"text":"I don't do raw stuff....until now! Best fresh seafood ever. I asked the man behind the counter what he liked and went with that. No gimmicky stuff. Good food and service, keeping it simple."}
{"text":"It's not the poke shack but then again we are not in Hawaii either.  It's a great place to get you fix for poke.  Great selection.  It's tough in the middle of the desert to get the same caliber fish.  Go check it out,  chances are you'll want to come back..."}
{"text":"Very happy to review this place after so many visits. It may not look like much with no seating and a deli-like set up, but the food is something that really temps & fulfills the soul.  

First off, the quality and authenticity is truly something to be admired. I have always been impressed with everything I've  received. 

My personal favorites are ahi limu, ahi wasabi, and ahi kimchi. Although the sauce base is used for most or all of the ahi poke I believe, each one is still unique and nothing short of flavor. *Come in early and they are more than happy to let you sample anything to your interest or liking, when fresh product is still available around noon or so. Also, they do military discount which is a great deal for such quality. 

Customer service is so personable and warming. Really makes you fee like you are walking into their home. One of my favorite places for raw fish anything."}
{"text":"VERY friendly staff.  Let me sample anything I wanted.  Also made-up some fresh Poke since they were out of some of it.

This Poke was different than what I purchased in Hawaii, but I assume this was higher quality stuff.  The stuff I got in Hawaii was just at a grocery store, and it was much smaller pieces of fish.  The Poke at this place are larger pieces-  super tender.  I personally prefer the smaller pieces, but can understand most people liking the larger pieces.

Warning-  no tables to eat at the store, also no tables outside (I believe)."}
{"text":"I'm literally salivating right now while reminiscing about about the poke I had here.
The guy at the counter was so nice, he let us sample about 5 or 6 different things since we were having trouble deciding what to get.  We went for the ahi furikake with avocado, the spicy ahi with masago and mayo and the seaweed salad with 2 sides of rice.  Everything was soooo good.  I wish We could have taken better photos but we just wanted to eat!  I will definitely be returning to this place when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love getting poke from here. It always tastes fresh and with enough flavor so that it doesn't overwhelm the salmon, ahi, or whatever else. They also give you the chance to try samples so that you know what it will taste like before you buy it. The price is a bit expensive per pound. The staff whoever works at the poke bowl is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My Husband was given a recommendation to try out poke express..the side deli area is the poke express. Look for island sushi grill. We where welcomed by Lee Ann M in the deli. She's very kind with great customer service and to mention her recommendation of poke choices and the amazing best ever tasting teriyaki chicken was spot on.  We had the delicious spicy avocado poke and my new fav spicy mayo poke with avocado, cucumber, and Masago. So delicious! Also we had malasadas (Hawaiian filled doughnut) haupia (coconut) and custard flavors. Our island cravings fulfilled, so yummy.  Only thing missing was shaved ice. Only four stars because it's hard to find. LOOK FOR ISLAND SUSHI GRILL and they share the same restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing poke and crab combo, and a nice atmosphere overall. I will definitely keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Selections are good but the prices are a little high but guess that's the price you pay for some poke. Customer service is great!"}
{"text":"I got to the store pretty late in the day and was disappointed to see that the only poke left was the furikake ahi. But when the man at the counter gave me a sample of the poke, I was no longer disappointed. The 1 inch cubes of very fresh tuna that were not overly salty. The flavor of the fish was not being overpowered by the marinade and was allowed to shine. I wish I could have tried everything they had to offer if what was left over at the end of the day was any indication of how good their food is."}
{"text":"Ahi poke was good but a little too much shoyu for my liking. I needed to get some rice just to offset the bitterness of the shoyu."}
{"text":"This place is legit!  The poke was so yummy and they have so many varieties that you will always find something you want to try. I come here every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The best Poké on Earth.  A must whenever I'm visiting Sin City and I always make sure to take some on the flight home."}
{"text":"The quality and cuts of their fish is declining since they open couple years ago. Do a taste test before buying."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service and the best poke in Vegas! Not too mention a ton of other goodies from back home! If you've never been, you missing out!"}
{"text":"Great place to get nothing like some good poke I would like if one were to open by Blue Diamond and Arville or Decatur so I wouldn't have to drive so far just to get some good food"}
{"text":"Very friendly!! Great selection that you can try before purchasing. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this place, wanted to try it since it had such a great Yelp rating.  The service was very friendly and the food was amazing for a great price.  I ended up getting 1/2 lbs. of Furikake Poke which was to die for.  Definitely coming back=)"}
{"text":"Dear Darren, and Micah,
You made our NEW YEARS EVE gathering GREAT!  With the sushi, sashimi, tako poke, Mr. B was happy.  Gotta have fish on that holiday!  You made the right move, taking your talent to LV, to showcase what you can do with fish.  You know you'll always have a strong following on the 9th island.  With all the locals up there, they need a good poke stop to go to.
Sashimi, was so ono, sushi hit the spot too.
By far your shop is the diamond in the desert!    
God Bless!"}
{"text":"So good. I am so happy that I found this place! I was beginning to wonder if Las Vegas had any place to buy fish. It took me three years to find this place, but I am glad I did!"}
{"text":"Was skeptical at first about the strip mall poke, but this was the best poke I've had outside of Hawaii and even topped some Hawaiian spots to boot. Highly recommend to any poke lovers. Keep in mind there is no seating inside so you'll need to take it to go."}
{"text":"I can eat this stuff everyday!  The tuna poke is always fresh! The price can't be beat! Prepared poke for $6.99/lb?  You can't even get sushi grade tuna for that price! 

They offer Military Discount! Bravo to businesses that support the military!"}
{"text":"made the (small) effort to try Poke Express and it lived up to its reputation! the furikake and wasabi were amazing!"}
{"text":"Always on point and always showing love. Awesome place with Bad azz Poké. Thanks for showing Aloha every time I come through."}
{"text":"We're from Hawaii, so this is the only place we go to get POKE!! I love the spicy ahi poke, my FAV! We always pick up a variety, usually 3-6 containers. I also love it when they have salmon, but this always seems like a crap shoot. Need to order more salmon, please!"}
{"text":"Visiting my parents in North LV & boy are we lucky to have this joint just down the street! We always gotta get poke to store in our ref for the weekend stay! My HusMan loves it too!"}
{"text":"Found this place serendipitously and am so glad I did! Wasn't sure what to expect because I've never gone to a poke restaurant before - just parked and said, what the heck. 

Walked in and everyone there was just ALL smiles. So wonderful! The staff offered me samples of a bunch of items and was so very patient with me as I selected my 2 pokes for my bowl. Spicy mayo tuna poke was my fav and the slight crunch of tobiko fish eggs were perfection. 

Only thing I wish they had was seating for diners - I wound up eating it in my car while streaming Netflix. :) I entertain myself well."}
{"text":"Impressed with the cleanliness, great customer service & fresh fish! Love ahi poke so this place was a definite MUST! Sampled the spicy ahi poke, shoyu poke, cone sushi & edamame. LOVE it. Will definitely recommend and return!!! (:"}
{"text":"Love love everything there. Prices for poke has skyrocketed, but when you got have it, get it here!
Everything is ONO! Try da Kim Chee poki!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Super friendly and great variety. Ask for Micah. They let you try before you buy. Awesome place. Will be back."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years to get fresh poke like I had growing up. This place is so delicious! The poke side of the restaurant is small but I think most people, like myself, take their orders to go. The staff is friendly and helpful. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This establishment truly deserves all the the ratings it gets! From the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out, my interaction with the employees here is what people call A1. Their employees are so friendly and more than happy to give you samples on things you aren't too sure about. I asked what was the most popular dish there and I got a sample of the tuna with spicy mayo and masago. OH MY GOD so much flavor deliciousness in one bite. I ended up getting 1 lb or 3 different dishes because I couldn't make up my mind! I would HIGHLY recommend this to ANYBODY who is willing to drive past Cheyenne just to try it! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the shoyu Ahi here.  I drive from the other side of town to get this and it's completely worth it.  

I like their cucumbers and the fish cake poke was pretty good too."}
{"text":"This is the best Poke I have ever had... incredible! I am going back today I am moving back to the east coast and the thought of not being able to have this again is depressing. Gonna talk them into opening up a spot back in DC."}
{"text":"Yummy and authentic. 

First time trying Poke, it was delicious, but very heavy for me!  We got a little one and still were full by the end.   Awesome service!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this place after reading reviews and hearing good things from a friend. Wandered into the place having no idea what to expect due to the tented windows and was pleasantly surprised to feel like I was stumbling into a hole in the wall plate lunch place in Hilo Hawaii. They had some good hawaiian tunes playing which I thoroughly enjoyed. Walked to the back where there was a display case with a pretty good selection of poke.  Got 1 lbs of the spicy ahi ($18 yikes, but we are in the middle of the desert) and took it to go and ate it with my own coconut rice at home.  As far as poke goes if i was going to rate it as if I were back home in Hawaii I would say that it meets the Foodland grocery store deli quality, not out of this world fresh but well seasoned and the right texture. They also had a sign for Hanalei Poi on Thursdays which I would like to try with my poke the next time I stop by. Hanalei Poi is my favorite Poi and I'm curious how well it travels to Vegas.  I decided to give this place 5 stars based on the experience and the fact that the poke was decent for a land locked state..... not 5 star by Hawaii standards so as long as you keep that in mind its a great find!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love poke express. Walking in makes you feel like you're back in Hawaii. I love that they offer hot rice as an option so that I can create my own poke bowl and throw down immediately. Ono poke especially being in the middle of the desert and the guys there are full of aloha."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time a couple weeks ago and I can't stop thinking about it. Walked in and I immediately thought I was in Kauai  at my fave little local poke place. The poke is so super fresh, so many kinds and preparations. It was hard to decide so I pretty much got one of each. The Kimchi Tako poke was out of this world good so was the spicy wasabi ahi. Kimchee cucumbers I could have eaten by the gallon.  Lots of items in the freezers too like mochi, salmon cheeks, and Portuguese sausage as well as Hawaiian dry goods like Haupia mix. I will be a regular!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to get excited about the poke is anything but & their really wasnt anything I tried that blew my skirt up."}
{"text":"\"I love this place so much. They even have lomi oio and poi. My favorite. The owners are so cool. Poke is Ono. just like back home on the islands. Mahalos so much for making this place here. Aloha\""}
{"text":"the fish is usually fresh, but some things are drenched in sauce so they can get the weight up without putting to much fish and sometimes hide the unfresh fish and dont even put the real weight most of the time."}
{"text":"We are a true fan of the poke in Hawaii. We were so excited to get here LV and find the place. They have it all. Been there a number of times. Always fresh and friendly service. If you know what poke is , then it is definately worth the drive to the North LV for the great kine."}
{"text":"Being new to North Las Vegas, I wanted something different for my taste bud and boy did I find it. This was my first experience with Hawaiian Poke and what a great experience! 

This place was a little tough to see when driving through W. Craig Rd but eventually found it after a couple of tries with the help of my phones Google map navigation. I didn't even get to smell the food on the first try since it was closed. This place have some weird hours. I persevered and made it inside the door the next day.

Once inside, I was overwhelmed by how many different kinds of Poke there was. The people behind the counter was a big help. I tasted pretty much everything they had. 

When it came to picking which ones to take home, I couldn't pick. Everything tasted really good. I just packed up 7 different ones. After trying out all the poke my favorite is the Spicy Ahi Poke and the Wasabi Poke. 

This is my go to spot for Poke at least once or twice a week. Awesome place!

Only cons about this place is their hours as mentioned before and there is no seating area.

If you ever end up in North Las Vegas and is looking to try something different or looking for some good Poke, this place is a must."}
{"text":"Definitely a spot to check-in to! It's like a taste of Hawaii on the mainland. They did it right! Just tasted about everything on the menu, and it didn't disappoint. Hint: Get there early!"}
{"text":"If you want amazing ahi and nice, genuine employees then come here! The poke is delicious and definitely something you wouldn't expect to find in Las Vegas! The owner is so nice and funny and you can tell how much he loves bringing poke to the people of Las Vegas. 

I just want to make a point of how nice he is. Usually when you go to places you get those annoyed looks from employees when you want more than one sample of something. BUT this guy was encouraging us to try almost everything! He loved showing us all the different kinds of poke/other fish he had! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This smaller outlet of Poke Express is disappointing.  Would rather make the trek up north for much better poke.   Service is good, but the issues here are the brown discolored fish I've seen more than once in the glass display case.  Often times they cut with the grain or there is too much sinew in the poke.  Just doesn't taste the same or have the nice texture that you would see at the location on Craig Road."}
{"text":"Poke is great and the service is always friendly.  Flavors are very precise.  Sometimes a little under seasoned, but still good.  

Nice to see the good quality madako."}
{"text":"The best poke ever tasted outside of Hawaii (except for mom's, of course).  After sampling a few kinds of poke, ordered the salmon w/special sauce, limu ahi, chili limu ahi, wasabi ahi and tako pokes, all super fresh and very ono!  Stop by 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate a few doors down for the gohan and anything else to complete your lunch or dinner....they are ohana so it's all good.  And for dessert, try the green apple slushy with ice cream, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Live this place! Always fresh! Always friendly service. Tasty and healthy. If you call ahead, you can order your rice to go."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get poke here in Vegas. I highly recommend this place if you love poke! Im a little bit frustrated though because the last time I stopped by near the holidays, the young person in the back looked irritated and insulted us when my family and I came in 15 minutes before closing. I understand that coming in close to closing time can be annoying for workers but I just love it here so much and didn't have the chance to get some earlier in the day. 

Now I'm craving some poke again but I don't even know if I should come back. I enjoyed coming here but now It's not the same coming in knowing if I'll get bad service or not. Sorry for coming in even though you were still open for 15 more minutes? You don't got to be disrespectful just because you didn't want to serve anymore. Just cause your in a bad mood and want to go home doesn't mean you should put other people in a bad mood as well. I learned my lesson. Don't come in near closing time. The older guy (probably the owner) is always nice though. Hopefully when I come back he'll be the only one there."}
{"text":"This place is great. I wish it didn't take me an hour to get there and back at lunchtime. Try all of the poke, there is something for everyone, and typically the guys there are super patient and encourage  you to sample everything. Nothing is bad, and prices are super reasonable.

This would be a 1-2 times/week lunch spot if it were closer to my office and if there was seating. When it's nice out, grabbing a poke bowl and eating across the street in the park is a really enjoyable lunch hour."}
{"text":"Food is good, the staff is soooo nice and attentive.  They acknowledge people as soon as they come in, take their time with you and answer any questions you have.  

Will keep coming back not only because the food is good but the staff is so great. 

Hoping they stay this way.

There is no place for you to sit its more of a take out place."}
{"text":"Not much more I can say than OMG!!!!!!!!!!  SO Amazing!  I tried a bite of just about everything while I was there and STILL couldn't choose!!!  Came back to work with 1.5lbs of Poke.  (1/2 lb each of 3 different kinds) and am already planning my next trip.  If you like sashimi you simply can't beat this place!  They also have a small wall of Hawaiian groceries..."}
{"text":"This is a new poke shop in North Las Vegas. There's a good assortment of poke (ahi, tako, shrimp, salmon, snail), pipikaula and other dried food. They also have shirts, drinks, and frozen goods. I loved the salmon & tako poke. And their service is very friendly."}
{"text":"So delicious!!! I made plans yesterday to visit for some poke and malasadas. This was my first visit and definitely won't be my last. When I arrived I ordered 1/3 containers of spicy avocado poke and one with furikake seasoning. I also wanted some with mayo but a girl in front of me some what cleaned it out.

Afterwards, I ordered 4 malasadas. Two regular and two with custard.

It was all so good!! Next visit I'm going to go all out and order my poke again and something from the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Makes me happy to find a poke place not too, too far away like the location on Eastern (though I do love that place too). I was determined to have another poke lunch so I drove a good 15+ minutes to get some. When I got there I bought 2 1/3 containers of the spicy wasabi ahi with mayo and the kimchi tako poke. As usual it's pricy but so delicious!  Afterwards I kind of craved some custard filled masaladas. ..but I know that's only at the location on Eastern."}
{"text":"best poke in town, service is fast and friendly.. lots of flavors to choose from. Mean grinds !!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding quality and amazing flavors! It was my first time eating fresh crab meat...and I want MORE! Wish there was something similar in NYC. Ahhh..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh poke this is the place to go. They have a wide variety to choose from, and they also have yummy deserts! I'm yet to try the sushi here. Overall, it's a great place with chill vibes and a friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Best Poke stop in Henderson! The fish is always fresh no matter what type of poke you get and now they have soft serve Hawaiian frost!
Darren and the whole staff is super cool and always has the Aloha welcoming!! 
Can't ever get enough of this place especially now with the Hawaiian frost!! 
Come check this place out you will NOT be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh poke! Workers are very nice and helpful always smiling. Poke is always consistent every time I go, prices are reasonable!!! I'm always happy when I have my poke from here!"}
{"text":"My first review, for a place worth reviewing! Was looking for food places in north Las Vegas for when me and my friends come up from San Diego for the spartan race, and i am sooo glad I came across this! Best poke in the mainland!! So many choices and all of them are sooo good!!! I ended up getting the ahi furikake, garlic ahi poke with shoyu and salmon poke with special sauce... I only got less than 1lb of each cause of it being perishable and we had a 5-6hr drive back to San Diego. ;( ;( I wish they had a store in SD cause I would be hitting it up everyday! The owner and I think it might've been his son? were really nice!! They totally showed the aloha spirit. Now I know why the have perfect ratings. Next time I come to Las Vegas, I am definitely hitting this place up again! This place is def a \"must go-to\" spot now for me."}
{"text":"What's not to love? The Poke is delicious and fresh. Best poke in Vegas. 

The service is great and always fast and friendly. 

The location is convenient and parking is easy. 

We've been coming here for months and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Their poke reminds me a lot of back home in Hawaii. I love the spicy ahi. They also have a variety of dry and frozen products from Hawaii too which is good so you don't have to look far if your looking for some Hawaii snacks for example. But by far the best poke place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"So like others before me, the restaurant you're looking for from the parking lot is ISLAND SUSHI.  Then as you enter, go to the back and you'll find Poke Express.  

When we asked for poke bowls, the friendly guy at Poke Express told us that they serve poke only but could sell us rice on the side as well.  We were happy with that, so we bought two types of poke, ahi shoyu poke and spicy combo poke and asked for rice on the side.  

Here's where things got confusing: We decided to order from Island Sushi as well, so after ordering from Poke Express, I went to the front to order from Island Sushi, while my husband waited to pay at Poke Express.  The guy at Poke Express said we could pay all together at the front at Island Sushi. The guy at Island Sushi then began to scoop our rice....so I have no idea if these two businesses are separate or together, but all I know is I paid at Island Sushi for everything.  Don't know if this information helps you or not, but it was confusing, \"So, pay here?  No pay there.  But rice here?  No, poke here, but rice at the front.\"  LOL.  Everyone was super nice and friendly however, so it wasn't really an issue.  

Poke was delicious-fresh and creamy, so satisfying, I could have easily eaten more.  While we were there, a gentleman came in and ordered nearly 2 lbs of every type of poke they had and the order nearly cleared them out, so be aware, they may sell out before the day is done.  

We will definitely return and this time I'll know what the heck I'm doing!"}
{"text":"We normally aren't in this part of town but we're looking for a quick bite. I love Poke'. The variety of poke was amazing from traditional to marlin. I enjoyed the spicy mayo version while my husband had the spicy with avocado. The prices were reasonable. We did not know there was no seating, that is why I didn't give it a 5."}
{"text":"Poke is ono. This is a great place to get your poke fix. Aloha"}
{"text":"Alright Food Lovers, anyone and everyone who loves to eat raw fish will love the Ahi Avocado Bowl! Oh my gosh I'm addicted to this! The Ahi is served on top of white rice with cucumbers and avocado with some type of plantain chips! Good for my belly! I always call in advance to place my order, takes about 10-15 minutes...."}
{"text":"Get while they Fresh!  If you like Hawaiian Poke, then you'll like this place.  It's in the back corner of Island Grill and Sushi.  First of the people, you'll they promote that local atmosphere.  I'm not originally from the Islands but they make wish I was.  Fun and friendly!  Now the poke...so fresh and tasty.  My favorite is shoyu with either ahi and salmon.  I can eat that every day.  If you like poi, come on thursdays and have that craving fulfilled here.  Only negative is they do sell out in the evening (which is good because that means tomorrows stock is FRESH.)  If you like poke, you can't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Great little Poke and Hawaiian food/refreshments stop. The Ahi is amazing. They will make it spicier for you if you ask. Very friendly staff. They let me try basically everything, almost insisted I try things. Was just as good as 'The Poke Shack' on the island of Hawaii, which says alot given that place brings in fresh fresh from just off the shore of the shop. If you like raw fish, especially Ahi (tuna), this is the place to go in Vegas. Ppl complain about the price on reviews, however in my experience, it is $12-20/lb of raw uncooked, sashimi quality tuna at most grocery stores, given this, the prices here are reasonable. Left with 1lb of fish and 1/2 lb of seaweed salad for less than 20 bucks. Completely overstuffed."}
{"text":"Such a great idea. I'm from Cali and I'm always finding new places to try. Such a good and creative spot. Prices are reasonable as well. I love poke. Def will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place dozens of times going to get teriyaki without know what it was. Finally saw Poke on a food show about a month ago and knew I had to try it. Stopped in yesterday and got the Monday/Tuesday bowl special with spicy ahi and crab kimchee, the owner with a smile warned, \"Now you're gonna be hooked.\" Only complaint I have is that when I went back to get more today I realized they're closed on Wednesdays. But there is definitely tons of Poke in my future."}
{"text":"Five stars, hands down the best poke place in town. :) I always come to this place for my poke cravings. They have a lot of poke varieties but I really like the kimchi poke and the traditional one. The crab meat combination is also good, and the mussel kimchi poke. These 4 items are my favorites in this place. Their pokes are always fresh, clean place, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We frequent Poke Express at least once a week.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  My husband can not have any seeds, and everything has seeds.  The staff has no problem custom making our order.  The grade of Sushi is fantastic and melts in your mouth.  I highly recommend Poke Express!!!!"}
{"text":"If you love poké then this is a must stop the next time you're in the Las Vegas area, for sure. They have ahi poké, tako(octopus) poké, salmon poké, and more. They come in different flavors, if they don't have one in the window, you can usually tell them and they'll be able to make more of it on the spot. The prices for the poké are really reasonable and you can get your favorite flavors and more for around $25 or less depending on how many pounds you're buying. This place also has some of the best Hawaiian plate lunches in Vegas and it also has a sushi restaurant that is also connected. So if you're in the mood for Hawaiian plate lunch and sushi then this is the place to be. Sometimes the spam musubis can be more rice like a rice block and I've had them look at it and made me another one free of charge because they knew that it's called a spam musubi and not a rice musubi for a reason. This place is definitely getting my business every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Fresh poke!
I bought $60+ worth for thanksgiving dinner as an appetizer and it was a hit!!
The poke stole the show from the turkey and ham. 
The tuna is as fresh and flavorful as they come.
I also tried some blue fin and it just melts in your mouth and not in your hand. 

The Staff is super friendly and helpful. 

I love this place 
it reminds me of FOODLAND in Hawaii where you just order poke in the deli/meat counter."}
{"text":"Love, love, love their poke! (And limu/kimchee tako too!) They've got so many options vs other local shops around town, which makes me drive across town on my days off. 

They will package your poke and sauces on the side so you can help yourself when you're home. If you don't see what you want, ask. They always pull the fish out the fridge for us. I would suggest bringing a little cooler of ice when you're traveling a far distance to keep the fish cold! 

Oh and they're located inside the Island Sushi Grill Restaurant, just walk in on the left side."}
{"text":"Great selections of Poke and the food was delicious. Good price for 1lb of raw fish."}
{"text":"First tip: This place has NO seating. Don't plan on eating there.
Quality was great, they make the spicy poke while you wait - it's not very spicy, but super good. That and the hawaiian style are the best. 
Service is not so great, disgruntled teenage boy who I think completed 3 sentences. But who cares? I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Ono Ono Poke! I like how sometimes they will get fish specials once in a while. I really like the Kajiki (marlin). I got to keep my ahi taste buds excited and this is the place to get them working. The fish is always fresh, and if you don't like driving around las vegas for hawaiian food, they also carry poi, lau lau, and kahlua pork in the refrigerator/freezer. I can't remember if they have portuguese sausage though. This is usually my one stop hawaiian shop."}
{"text":"Great selection. For the selection of Poke- all around $10/lb. I tried the Ahi Hawaiian and the Ahi Wasabi- delicious. It's a clean, friendly, family owned deli/market style set-up.  I work less than a mile away once/week which is great, but the only problem is they close by 6PM. :(

They also own a new restaurant in that same plaza \"808 Hawaiian\". I definitely will be trying that next."}
{"text":"Searching for places around my house in North Las Vegas I stumbled across Poke Express on Yelp. I had ordered poke numerous times in restaurants but had no idea how many different types of Poke there were. 

Visit in the morning, because the afternoon is just made to order, which is a bit difficult on your first visit. When you visit in the morning the beyond friendly owner will let you sample as many different types as you'd like. I'm pretty sure my friend and I got half a pound of just samples before even deciding what type to purchase. 

Prices are based on the price of fish so they have been different every time I've been in, but its always been worth the price. My personal favorites are the wasabi poke and the kimchi poke. Both have a bite to them, yum! 

Great addition to our North Las Vegas community =)"}
{"text":"I love that its now close to my hale,but they close early @ 6 pm,so if ya want for din,ya have to get there prior..."}
{"text":"I loved being greeted with a friendly smile immediately upon walking in. The staff was helpful giving me details of their seafood on how its prepared and made from scratch all while sampling about 6 different varieties of ahi. I left with 1/2 lb of shrimp poke kim chee style, shoyu poke and spicy ahi poke for less then $15. I couldn't of been happier! Don't forget to check out their poke bowls. I promise it will NOT disappoint."}
{"text":"Finally a poke place 5 min from my house. Poke is ono and they have a small selection of local grocery. I will prob be going here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Poke is so ONO! You can tell they take pride in the making of it. Fish and Tako is seasoned so well! Every bite is tasteful! Better than the poke at the stores back home! Lol. Keep up the good work :)"}
{"text":"Yums! All kinds of different Poké to choose from. This place reminds me of Hawaii. It's so authentic! You come in and pick whatever you want and you can get it by the lb, 1/2 lb, or 1/4 lb. I love how you get all the flavor out of the poke here. You can't dine here since there is no table. Just come in, get it and go.. so Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the spicy ahi with avacado poke, cucumber kimchi and seafood salad with a side of rice... Fresh and clean flavors. The staff here is great! Super friendly and helpful. I wish they had a small sitting area or a couple of outdoor table and chairs ."}
{"text":"The closest thing I can get to poke like back home, but on the mainland. I always, always, always stop here when I'm in Vegas at least once, to satisfy my constant craving for poke. It was my favorite food growing up in the islands &it is still my favorite food, although much less available if not nonexistent, now that I live in California.

So if you want real Hawaiian poke at great prices, &even other goods found only in Hawaii, &not that fake Costco crap which is decent at best - or any other made up restaurant poke (which I must mention is ALWAYS overpriced whether the restaurant is fancy or not), THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO!"}
{"text":"wow.  i didnt think this place was good at all.  the fish wasnt good, the seasoning wasnt good.  wouldnt go back if it were half the price.  i guess i am too used to tanioka's"}
{"text":"Ever since we tasted amazing Poke in Hawaii, we always crave good poke. 

We got the spicy ahi, mayo and masago ahi and kimchi ahi. They were really good. Oh we got two scoops of rice two @$1.5. Gotta have poke with white rice!!
We will definitely return tomorrow lol"}
{"text":"I'm going back again tomorrow - this place is extremely delicious! The fish tasted great and the service was excellent. I tried most of the flavors and they were all great."}
{"text":"Just looking at the photos made my mouth water.  Better than KTA on the islands. :)  Nice, friendly service."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Hawaii. Salmon poke is excellent. Ask for the sauce on the side if you are not going to eat it right away."}
{"text":"As recommended by yelpers, I arrived early and was able to sample the Poke. Yum. Great quality Ahi, Salmon etc.  I loved the pickles also. We will go back. My favorite was the spicy avocado and the ahi in oyster sauce. Customer service was great and super helpful. They explained the menu and offered sampled of items I had not asked for.  Highly recommend sushi lovers to give poke a try if you never have."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. Authentic poke with great selections and great service."}
{"text":"Wow. I tried this place based on the reviews and it was better than everyone said.  I've had poke in many locations but this by far the best. The service was amazing, they let me sample the different poke and gave great advice.   The prices were very reasonable, I've bought plain sushi grade fish for more than this poke."}
{"text":"During numerous visits to downtown Las Vegas, I was introduced to Hawaiian cuisine.  Nothing too far out of the ordinary - loco moco, spam musubi, oxtail soup, stuff like that.  Good comfort food.

I'd never tried poke before:  after doing some searching on Yelp, I decided to shoot up to NLV and try Poke Express.

Poke Express is like a deli for raw fish.  The number of choices was somewhat overwhelming, and I didn't know what the hell I was doing.  Thankfully, the folks behind the counter were EXTREMELY HELPFUL.  In fact, they were all over me like flies on shit, let me tell you.  Usually I get a bit defensive in the presence of aggressive service, but these people were so sweet that it didn't make me even slightly uncomfortable.

The poke was extemely fresh and I enjoyed it a lot.  However, I made a couple of rookie mistakes.  If you've never had poke and want to try this place, don't make these mistakes.

(1)  Don't automatically pick the first two things you like.  The staff will make you try at least six-eight items.  They will, I'm telling you.  They're very persistant.  I'd already purchased 1 lb of poke when I tried the kim chee octopus.  It was FABULOUS.  Wish I could have bought some, but how much poke can one person eat???

(2)  Get some rice next door or pick some up on the way home.  You really need some rice.  I ate all the poke and 2 beers in my hotel room, but some rice to cut the poke with really would've helped towards the end...

I'll be back on my next visit to LV, and I'm having the octopus..."}
{"text":"Brah...such a mean ending to a hard days work...Brahdah knew tons of my boys from back home...Ridrigues, Naipo, even Mana...frikin small world \"Crusaders\" fo life...Aloha and Much Mahalos for the Grinds HAWAIIAN"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Every time I come here it's always a pleasant experience. The ahi poke is always fresh and so delicious! There are many different flavors to choose from and I have tried just about all of them. I can't complain about any of them. The price paid is well worth it for some fresh ahi poke. My favorite is the spicy avocado or the ahi limú. Delicious! Sad they aren't open on sundays but it's worth the wait. Thanks Poke Express for always taking care of my ahi craving and keeping things clean and fresh!"}
{"text":"THIS IS IT. Look no further... 

Traveled to Hawaii many times and always loved getting poke. Thank goodness that Poke Express is in Vegas. Came across while browsing Yelp and knew it had to be good because of the 5 stars. Boy did it deliver. 

I ordered the Wasabi ahi with spicy mayo and Wasabi ahi without the mayo and both were delicious. The combo of all the ingredients made for such a nice, light and cool meal on a hot Vegas day. 

The workers are super friendly too spreading that Aloha spirit to all those that pass thru their doors. Amazing food great people. Definitely recommend! ALOOOOOHA!"}
{"text":"My fave place to get Poke on the mainland! Every time we come to Henderson, this is a must-stop for us.  Although we have a lot of new Poke places in California, they all suck! They don't know Poke.  I hate that those places don't marinade their Poke because they do it made-to-order.  It's all gimmick and no flavor.  I wish they would open a location in California! My favorite one is the Spicy Ahi which comes with spicy mayo and masago! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Poke overload!!!  Wow...  Best poke I've had since Hawaii.  I wish they had a shop on the east coast.  Very friendly and accommodating staff with samples."}
{"text":"First time here, glad I stopped in today.  Reminds me of being in Hawaii.  Fresh and great tasting poke store in town.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I probably go here about four to five times a months. The guys behinds the counter are very attentive and friendly as most Hawaiians are. :) My favorite is the spicy avocado ahi poke and kimchi shrimp. 
You'll find a large variety of different pokes; fish, crab, shrimp, mussels and more. They also have a refrigerator filled with Hawaiian products such as, sausages, ice creams and more like a little mini-mart. 
You have to stop by early afternoon and check it out. Don't wait too late, they carry limited fresh supply of poke."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Found this on yelp, great reviews and only in town for 2 nites. Stopped in for lunch before checking in to hotel. Lits if choices. We ordered 2 containers of pike furikake  and shoyu. The shoyu had more flavor, but the fish was great. Ordered 1 scoop rice to share. 

Very friendly, clean and some island finds in thw side...pilot crackers, bittles of shoyu, island sun drinks, etc. 

A hidden jewel."}
{"text":"We arrived 5 mins before closing time, they already had most items put away.
The guy who served us seems to hurry us out. I asked a few questions he seems short with me. So I don't think you should go before closing time. 
He did not offer to let us taste anything. We drove 30 mins to visit this store so I wish we had a better first impression.
We ordered : 
Limu poke- too salty for my taste
Wasabi poke - excellent"}
{"text":"The food is really really good. This coming from a fish snob. Get the salmon poke or call ahead, it sells out really quickly. Also keep in mind this place closes at 6pm. 
No seating or anything, just go in, get your food and get out. Not really a place to sit and eat."}
{"text":"We came here twice in one day because we loved the spicy mixed poke and needed more pupus for the party. hehe. There were mixed reviews among my group about the other poke. They liked some of the poke from here and some of the poke from Hawaiian Style. Both had some good ones and some not so good ones. But for this place, the spicy mixed poke was the winner. I'm sure we'll all be back here when we are craving it. I wish we had places like this in the South Bay."}
{"text":"POKE HEAVEN! Such a large assortment that is always served fresh with consistant friendly service. Choose your weight (quarter lb, half lb, 1 lb...), pick your poke, weighed & priced accordingly. Can be a little pricy ranging from as low as $3.49 - $14.95 per pound depending on what you choose, but when you consider the quality, flavor and freshness of everything -- it's totally worth it! 

FOR HER: I go for a half pound (or a pound so I have some for later!) of the IMITATION CRAB COMBO.

FOR HIM: A full pound (so he can share with me!) of the GARLIC AHI POKE WITH SHOYU. 

PRO TIP: Order a few scoops of white rice, buy some packs of seaweed & eat it with it! Makeshift mini hand rolls! So bomb.

*They also have hawaiian sun beverages/pancake mix/flavored jam, hurricane popcorn, flavored seaweed, assorted candy and lots of random imported snacks!

NOTE: No seating or inside dining. Carry out only!"}
{"text":"Pretty good poke. I know I'm skewed because I'm just comparing it to the stuff in Hawaii, which is cheaper and fresher. But, then again there is not much in Las Vegas that could compare to this place. 

We got a half a pound of the spicy avacado ($8) and a quarter pound of spicy ahi combo ($5). Both were about 7/10. Ordered a side of rice which came with 2 scopes for about 2 bucks. Tipped the guy cause he was nice and let us try them.

Will return when I'm craving poke again"}
{"text":"All I can say is I will still rush this place for the food even though it means dealing with the insane traffic I have to endure at 215 and eastern.  

It's in the rotation for places we like to dine at or take out. They take pride in the business. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last Saturday to pick up some lunch to go (this location does have tables and chairs, but the other Poke Express location does not have any seating) around 11 am. Poke Express is located inside this restaurant called Island Sushi & Grill (specifically located next to a Mediterranean/ Persian restaurant). Once you enter, just walk towards the back and you will see Poke Express. 

Anyways, when I walked over to the counter, I was immediately acknowledged and offered samples of any of the poke that I wanted to try. The man who was helping me was very nice and friendly. I ended up purchasing ~1 pound of both furikake ahi poke ($15.95 per pound prior to tax) and Kim Chee Mussel Poke ($7.99 per pound, prior to tax).

The Furikaka Ahi Poke is your classic ahi poke that was fresh tasting. The marinade had a nice savory light taste. 

The Kim Chee Mussel Poke surprisingly was not too spicy for me (I don't do spicy food like at all) and had a really great flavor. It was definitely my favorite of the two (my husband agreed). 

I also picked up a side of rice for an additional $1.50 (comes with 2 scoops of white rice). 

-------------------------------
(Total= $26.29, includes tax, prior to tip)

This poke lasted us for at least 2 meals each, which isn't bad for the price we paid. But I think next time if we come here, we will probably order a half pound next time since it was quite a lot for us. 

Poke Express has many different poke options, each of which are delicious (some are traditional and some are quite creative and new flavors I have not had before). I love that you can get a sample of each flavor and that the man helping us was more than happy to help us (truly showing us the true Aloha spirit). I will definitely come back here the next time I come back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Just left, & Great GREAT GREATTTTT service. Got convinced to try all of the raw samples & I'm glad I did!! (Including some cooked) Awesome decision for a light lunch. And I'll probably back tomorrow! Haha. They may have a regular on their hands for that must have raw fish cravings! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely Fantastic. The boys from Island Sushi's Poke express came over here. I wondered why Island Sushi didn't taste the same. My boys came over this way! After my workout, this is where I am. So frigggggggggin goood. Fish is always fresh and the team seasons and spices it to your taste. Love the Salmon Poke/ponzu sauce. friggin amazeeee-balls."}
{"text":"We went here couple of hours before it closed and salmon is all gone! But still there's a long line. 

The crab salad is too salty to the point I couldn't eat it. 

tuna tasted ok, liked the flavors though . 

I like that they have alot of choices"}
{"text":"Best place to get poke and other stuffs. Owners are really friendly. This place is a go to."}
{"text":"By far the freshest poke in the valley. Prices range from 5.99/lb to 14.99/lb. They have everything from seaweed salad to octopus to mussels and of course ahi tuna. Good thing that they give samples, there are too many choices!

Its totally worth it to buy it by the pound and order furikake rice separately."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time-top favorite poké places to go to. Everything is super flavorful and the way everything is prepared and the way it tastes screams traditional to me. I feel most Poké places attempt at a fusion take at poké to be different and better, but Express shows how classic traditional poké can't be topped!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is perfectly fresh. Customer service is great!  They will ice your food for a long drive. Too bad there aren't any seats inside. I would love to eat there. Otherwise, bringing it to go and enjoying it in the comfort of your own home is just as good.  They will take orders over the phone if needed. There is a mini grocery section with convenient snacks and drinks. 

Must order items:
Spicy poke 
Hawaiian style poke 
Tako kimchee 
Salmon 
Cucumber Kimchee
Lomi lomi salmon"}
{"text":"I recently moved here from CA and was looking for a good poke spot around town. I just found this place 6 days ago & have already eaten there THREE times!!! They are beyond delicious - so many flavors and different varieties. You will not be disappointed!! They have lots of goodies from back in Hawaii too!!! I have fallen in love with this place..."}
{"text":"Best Poke you'll find in las vegas period!!! If youre in town and love raw fish and all them hawaiian goodies this is the place to come!!!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to being an addict when it comes to Poke Express. This is one of the best spots I've been to in Vegas. I'm actually driving to Poke Express as I write this because I'm inspired by my writing to eat."}
{"text":"I make room in my schedule to come here every time I go to Vegas.  The fish and service are top notch.  They encourage you to sample everything, answer any questions, and never hurry you even when there's a line.  

At my first visit, I told them that I found the store through yelp after suffering a major poke craving (since Vegas has a big Hawaiian population, I thought there had to be poke somewhere right!?!!) and made my friends change our drive home plans so we could go there when they opened.  The lady behind the counter added bags of ice for the long drive home and told us to call ahead next time, that staff come in early to prep for the day and make fresh poke and would gladly open the store for us. 

Thoughts of poke brought me in to this place but their service keeps me coming back.

P.S.  Get some malasadas on your way out.  They make them hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Still amazing food and service! Fish was fresh, seasoning is spot on, and always delicious. It is set up deli-style so you pick out which poke you want and appropriate weight (1/4lb, 1/2 lb, etc...). They offer rice (while supply lasts) by the scoop too. They also have a small selection of Hawaiian snacks, portugese sausage, jams, pancake mix, sauces, etc... For our military members, they have a military discount for each pound of poke purchased. A definite mainstay in our neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"This business is family owned and operated. The Poke is authentic, reasonably priced and delicious. A must for me when I come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Awesome poke, all kine poke. So fresh. Taste like back home. High expectations when I've lived on the islands for 30 years. Owners are from the islands, so no wannabes here. (Bad past experience with people selling island stuff, but come to find out, they have no relation to the islands). They know what locals like and eat. They got island products in the store, as well as, on the shelves and freezers."}
{"text":"Great service and food! If you're looking for real poke then this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Fresh and yummy!  I wish they were here in San Diego!!  I am in Las Vegas at least once a month for work.  I stopped in before I hit the road to head back home.  I bought 2 lb's of the Ahi Shoyu Poke, 1/2 lb of the Tako Shoyu Poke and 2 bags of poi.  (to share with my Hawaiian neighbors).  I highly recommend you stop in and get some when you need your fresh fish fix.  Can't wait until I get back in December."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I go at least once a week. The food is always fresh. They even give samples."}
{"text":"i eat here more than i should... the crab combo with white rice is heavenly. all the fish pokes are really super good. always fresh and always tates good."}
{"text":"Wow! Thanks (again) to all my Yelp \"friends\"....  This place is fantastic! Considering how much I miss Hawaii & poke this really hits the spot!

Really, really good poke. We got the spicy combo, shoyu and ocean salad. It was so good we went back to get more to have for dinner later. Along with some huli huli chicken....  a special for today - lucky for us we showed up when they have this delicious dish available because from what the owner said it's not often. Also, I'm usually not a big fan of most versions of macaroni salad but be sure to try the mac salad here. It's some of the best I've ever had  

Great friendly service and we got a couple of malasadas to go.  I'm in heaven!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch (finally) after an appointment near Lake Las Vegas on Thursday. Mildly convenient location off Stephanie and 215. Why I say mildly is because its more of a pain in the butt getting out of that plaza than getting in. Lol 

There were a few people in line, but no visit to the east location has been without a line. It went by fairly quickly. 

Since they split from Island Sushi that used to be on Eastern, they now offer \"bowls\" of their own, probably more in a bento box way. Option of 1 or 2 poke types and option for 1 or 2 scoops of white or brown rice. I had chosen Ahi Poke w/ Limu w 2 scoops of white rice topped with furikake, and a 1/4 pound of spicy garlic tako poke on the side. Label wise, it said 7.33 for almost 1/2 pound ahi poke and 3.92 for 1/4 pound tako poke. Unsure if they zero out the container though. +$0.75 per scoop of rice. Total ended near $14. 

Quite a bit of food. Almost felt like there were more than 1/2 pound of ahi poke. Their ahi poke w/ limu is always good. Lightly seasoned. Limu adds a new texture of some crunchiness to the soft ahi poke. 

I had always thought the tako poke was cooked octopus. I didn't find out it was actually raw until I got home. Not really complaining. Flavoring was nice. The octopus was surprisingly tender and soft. Typically not too much of a fan of octopus but this was fairly decent. 

Overall, poke express will always been poke express. Simple and yummy. Hope I get the chance to drive by on an off day so I can bring some for my friend who likes this place too, but unfortunately, quite far away, since we live on the southwest."}
{"text":"Mind-blowingly good!!! Had to visit two nights in a row and it never disappointed. Out of the four different pokes we tried, the spicy wasabi ahi was by far our favorite - amazing!! The sweet chili, hawaiian, and garlic were all delicious, too. Highly recommend & can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"By far the best poke I've had outside of Hawaii thus far.  We were greeted by the owner, who showed us such friendly Hawaiian hospitality and took the time to let us try their different flavors. The selection is great and the fish tasted delish...all-around fave was the Ahi Furikake.  If you're ever in Vegas and craving that island poke, this place is legit and you could even get Hawaiian specialty items that they import in.  This place definitely has that Hawaiian island feel that I love...and miss :)"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out and it did not disappoint me. I told the girl behind the counter ( I wish I got her name she was so friendly) that I have never been there before and she asked if I wanted to try everything! I was happy to try it all out and everything was delicious and fresh. I ended up getting the ahi tuna Hawaiian style and the spicy ahi combo. I love the freshness and friendliness of this place. The pricing on the ahi was good too. Not bad at all. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times in the past three months and they are always on point! The food here is so fresh and it has no bad smells. I was expecting it to smell like fish my first time going but it seemed nice and clean. And they helped me pick something i'll like, which is helpful and increases my chances of coming back.They are very friendly. The next time I go back i'm gonna try something different and go for their wasabi poke!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon at 4pm. Lots of people on both sides including poke express. Since it was after 1pm, all orders are made upon order. I've came to this location before as well as the other one, on the north side of town, but I've always had 1 thing lacking.... SPICY ! I saw at this location, they had a wasabi ahi (overheard from another person in line it gives a punch) as well as the spicy ahi... EXTRA spicy. 

Guy measured about of tuna with container in fridge and went to mix each one. After the wasabi ahi one was made, he started on the spicy ahi. Due to my order being EXTRA spicy, he pulled this small bottle from the fridge. I don't know what it is but I believe Thats definitely not what they usually use ! 

After paying, I left and of course couldn't wait to try it. Tried the wasabi ahi first. Oh man! Definitely packs a punch to the sinuses ! Wow ! Not expected to be that strong ! I like :D this one was mixed like a limu or shoyu ahi with sliced onions (which by the way soaks up wasabi too so that punched me as well totally unexpected!), as well as masago, and sesame seeds. 

Now the EXTRA spicy ahi (doh! forgot to tell him to put less mayo) for some reason, they put a lot. But aside from that.... Oh man it's spicy ! Woohoo ! A little lacking on the masago on this one :x sad. XD 

Overall, oh man love it ! Spicy n sinus clearing ! What a snack I picked up today ! Gotta eat them all !"}
{"text":"Walked in for the first time. Told them I never been here before so they immediately start handing me sample after sample. The salmon with the special sauce is so good! They are super friendly, quick service and everything is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!! My girlfriend is Filipino and introduced me to it! Spicy tuna poke is so good if u want just a nice take home snack. Many options with fresh fish! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have to say that I find myself driving out of my way for it. I am a huge fan of the spicy, the limu, and the furikake.

They are incredibly kind and offer free samples too!

What I really hate about this place is that it closes so early! BUT.. for some of you who cannot make it by closing... you can call ahead... and they will have it waiting for you on the restaurant side."}
{"text":"first off, we drove around the parking lot a couple of times searching for poke express signage .. nope, there was only a little window decal on the door of island sushi and grill. after seeing rave reviews on yelp for the poke i had to try this place but perhaps my expectations were too high because i was thoroughly disappointed. 

i arrived thinking i would be able to take a look at the poke in the window and be able to pick but they were only making it to order. so there was hardly anything sitting in the display case...

the set-up for the store is awkward as well needless to say we we're confused on where to order..

the food itself was just okay. i ended up thinking to myself that this was definitely not worth the drive from the strip in search for..."}
{"text":"I was craving some poke so I stopped by to finally try the Wasabe Ahi Poke. It was just ok. I picked up half a pound and also a quarter pound of the Raw Wasabe Poke which was very good. 

I love how the employees were speaking pidgin with some Hawaiian customers. Even though the Wasabe Ahi Poke didn't satisfy my poke craving, I still gave them 5 stars because everyone who works here is always super friendly."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars but the hours are pretty limited. If you work a 9-5 job you are basically S.O.L to ever be able to eat here. Been here a few times when able to make it and the food was great... and always want to go for dinner but they close at 6pm unfortunately :/"}
{"text":"The OTHER poke place in town with two locations, one in the North side on Craig, the other one on Eastern on the southeast side. 

This location is not attached to a restaurant like the other location is. No pros/cons in that. just saying. Less busy in comparison but still popular. 

A lot of times i'm in this area, is due to work, and usually that's sometime in the mid afternoon. By then, most if not all the ahi poke is gone but the best thing is, even if they are out, you can still order and they'll make some for you ! 

My two favorites is their spicy ahi poke and the limu ahi poke. 

Spicy Ahi Poke is the one with a mayo/kewpie sauce with masago and some chili sauce (probably sriracha). Slightly spicy. (prefer to be more spicy... wonder if i can request it to be more spicy?? NEXT TIME !) masago gives a nice surprising popping texture which is nice 

Limu Ahi Poke is a poke with limu (algae or seaweed), and chopped green onions. In comparison to Hawaiian Poke in Chinatown, i actually like this a bit more. Their limu is a bit more crunchy and the salt crystals they put arent as big."}
{"text":"Vegan in a poke store?!? I know, I know...

I came for the seaweed salad that they call ocean salad.

I called ahead of time on the way there just to make sure it doesn't have fish sauce, it doesn't! 

The kimchi cucumber does not have fish sauce also! 

They have several other items that I grabbed and I totally was not expecting to find! 

Be super careful if you are sensitive because a lot of their packaged items have MSG...like a ton of them.
I didn't buy those items because we can't eat MSG.

The seaweed salad is super yummy and I will be back by whenever I am in this part of town again!

Check out my photos, I bought some snacks and noodles."}
{"text":"Just have to give them the credit they deserve!

As far as finding a place in Vegas to get poke, it doesn't get better than Poke Express.
They have lots of options and everyone I have tried has been delicious!

The people there are always friendly when I go in, and they always make me try the different options. I love free samples as much as the next person!

The store is very simple, nothing fancy. Also, it isn't really a place to go sit down and eat.  But the food, which is what matters, is ono!

They usually have poi shipped in on Thursdays. 

Anyone who likes pokes (or who doesn't know if they like poke) should try this place!"}
{"text":"This is a great poke place! Fresh, savory, and nice cuts of meat in unique flavor choices. My favorite is the salmon poke! If you are ever in North Las Vegas, I highly recommend you stop and check this small shop out. Also, they have a military discount! I usually stop in for lunch but have taken poke to go as well."}
{"text":"OMG... I lived in Hawaii for about a year n a half while in the navy and this place hit spot on with the poke I used to get from Safeway! Their poke is fresh and I might even say that I like their spicy ahi even better! You can get rice with the poke for 75cents each scoop and eat in the restaurant (I say this only because island sushi is the main restaurant). Def a 5 star place for me on flavors alone"}
{"text":"It's hard finding a legit poke place when I'm away from home (aka Hawaii) but this place is a pretty good Poke place in Vegas. From the main street, it was hard locating where it was in the shopping center but if you look closely at the doors it should have a small \"Poke Express\" sign on one of their doors. It's combined with Island Sushi so just spot for the huge ISLAND SUSHI sign above the doors. 

The inside is relatively medium sized with about 10 tables for seating, and I think it's separated from the Island Sushi eating area. You'll see their seafood serving area if you walk towards the back. Like any typical Poke place, there are all the different fishes/seafood placed in their respective trays in a cooled area with the price per pound sign by them. 

The person was very friendly and helpful, the area was clean and for the price, I think it was pretty moderate. I was all up on the Spicy Ahi Combo, it tasted fresh for the most part and almost like home, just not that exactly the same. 

If you're an ahi/poke/pupu/hawaiian local kind of person, you can't go wrong with Poke Express, because it's as close as I've gotten to good poke! They just don't do poke bowls bro, but you can ask for rice on the side! lol"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been stalking this place via Yelp for a while now. We come to Vegas on an annual basis and after our poke filled honeymoon in Hawaii last fall we knew we could not pass it up on this trip. 

Although it's quite the trek off the strip (if you're a tourist like me) it is totally worth it if you're looking for that same poke experience you get on the islands. The place is family run and every person working was happy to talk to us, explain the different dishes, offer tastings, and share stories about the family and business. The service alone is reason enough to come here. 

If you're not familiar with poke it is important you know what to expect. The store is not a restaurant but more of a small deli. They main dishes are all seafood with the majority of them being raw and seasoned with spices and oils. You pay by the pound and carry out. 

Poke Express had a ton of offerings and definitely had all of our favorites. We tried many of the dishes but left with the spciy tuna, sesame tuna, and two salmon dishes that we had them make to our specifications. You can order anything you want a la carte with your choice of preparation. We walked away with two pounds of fish at under $30 and could not have been happier. 

The only cons to Poke Express is that it's not very accessible if you don't have a car and the fish is mostly ordered frozen. (Who knew there was such a lack of fresh ahi tuna in the middle of the desert???)

Like I said, my husband and I make the trip to Vegas once a year and we will definitely be making this one of our routine stops from here on out."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Excellent excellent poke place. I love...everything they have.

FYI, this is NOT a dine in place. Take out only. In fact, they don't even always have rice. However, their poke cannot be beat in taste, freshness, or value. I believe I have tried every single thing they have (in fact, if you visit early enough in the day, they will literally let you try everything). Some of my all time favorites are the salmon poke, tuna poke with avocado, kimchi poke, and kimchi raw crab. 

Service is ALWAYS super duper friendly and I feel very fortunate that it's so close to work for me. Surprising gem in the neighborhood. you guys rock!"}
{"text":"I feel so bad this is tardy! Brennan you rock! Ok...so we ate it all and the last thing on my mind was pictures...1st thing was my taste buds and awesome protein for my body. I took home over 100.00 of various flavors/ingredients and we all loved it! After my workout today I'm treating my family again. Yelp needs six stars...Poke Exress is da kine!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous! Tastes like Hawaiian authentic poke! Yum yum yum. Good customer service and it's made to order so super fresh."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem is located in Big Lots shopping center, walking distance from yummy 808. If you love fish, you must try Poke. Their staff is beyond friendly and they love new faces, and they will remember you the next time they see you. Their fish is always fresh and their sauce is OMG good!! Take it home and toss some Mahi Mahi over rice or on a salad, it will be your favorite place."}
{"text":"All I can say is ONOLICIOUS!!! I have yet to find a place with great variety of raw fish. This place is good. They even have frozen and dry goods from the 808"}
{"text":"We come into Poke Express almost once a week because we are always craving their poke. 

We always get the spicy combo and the wasabi poke with two sides the kimchi cucumbers and the spicy crab combo because it just satisfies the needs of our palates. 

The spicy combo is creamy and the wasabi poke is spicy so it has balancing flavors. 

I only wish that they sold rice :( because we go next door to Teriyaki Madness to buy it.

Other than that the service is really good they are extremely friendly and they make the poke to order if it is out. They almost always make the poke for us because when we get out of work and head there, it is almost 5pm, 1 hr before they close. 

We also tried the laulau that was frozen to make at home and that was extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"Yep. Best one in Las Vegas...this is authentic Hawaii style...simple set up...good crew...great grinds. No sit down, take out only."}
{"text":"I just got back from Hawaii and remembered to yelp this place. The poke is great. A good variety and very fresh. It's out of he way but worth the trip off the strip."}
{"text":"This Poke is amazing & there are tons of flavors to choose from. I got two different flavors with rice (they do rice on Monday & Tuesday). I wish you could eat there, that is my only feedback. I will be making this place a regular lunch stop in the future!!!"}
{"text":"Best poke spot out this way! Spice ahi poke with masago & mayo is my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"You walk in, and the place looks simple enough, the place looks like a simple fish market. And I don't usually like poke in general that much, mainly because they don't do it like they do it here. Everything I've eaten is great. The quality of the fish, is amazing really. It's far away north, and there are a couple of other ones closer, but this location is the best. The guys who work there seem serious about what they do. We usually get like 5 lbs to bring back home and we finish it in 2 days easy. Wasabi ahi poke is amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! Just like Hawaii. Hubby and I spent $40 because we wanted to try everything, but you can definitely have a delicious meal for $10, if you get the poke bowl special. It takes a whole lot to get me off the Strip when I visit Vegas, but this is for sure going to be my new Vegas tradition!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to grab some poke for lunch at Poke Express. This is my first time at this location as I have visited the one off of Craig a couple of times already. 

First off live the selection of poke offered! So many to choose from. The fish is super fresh!!

Secondly, Ana I g customer service. When I walked in there was a short line, but almost immediately someone came out from the back to help me. They asked if I wanted to sample something, I said no ( I already knew what I was getting) placed my prefer in and out in less then 10min!"}
{"text":"I get why this place is all the rage. The poke is super fresh and really good. I'm giving less than 5 stars because it seems pricey for a place that doesn't have dine-in seating, or any sides or condiments to go with the poke. But still, worth the visit when we're in town. 

It's a deli style storefront, and if you're going to drive away more than 15 minutes, maybe make sure you don't keep it in a hot car. Bring a small cooler or have the a/c on high. Just sayin..."}
{"text":"fresh poke everyday. even when they are about to close, and they are out. the owners will go in the back and whip it up for you fresh. As good as it gets. I have had the imitation crab avocado combo. not a big fan of spicy, but this has just the right amount. kimche mussels poke was great and so was the shoyu and salmon poke. you get what you pay for, and it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've made a habit of frequenting poke express on Sundays. The people are so, so friendly and will offer to give you a sample of anything you like and are helpful with recommendations. I love seeing the same folks working every time I'm there and they make it a quick and easy experience. The spicy mayo masago is delish! My first time with it, I thought it was too spicy but I've gotten addicted to it. You can't go wrong with any of the selections here. It's all very fresh and good quality. The place is clean and the people, like I said are amazing. A must stop when you're in the north!"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome  man. I can a little late when they closed but the manager/closer was there and gave me some of his. Definitely coming back appreciate you"}
{"text":"Quick and delicious Poke!!!! Went to grab a quick lunch with my brother and this place was perfect. So many options and they let you sample whatever you want! I will absolutely be back. Please expand to Los Angeles!!!!!"}
{"text":"I rate them 5 stars because this is a review on what they do best.  POKE!    If you like poke, this is hands down the freshest, tastiest game in town. They have a great selection and I have never had any that tasted even slightly \"off\".    
The salmon poke and tuna limu poke are two of my favorites."}
{"text":"A little taste of home up in the 702.. a little on the pricy side, but they carry stuff from Zippy and other goodies from the 808. After a hard day at work, good place to convert from \"english\" to \"MOKE MODE\" wid da braddahs dat work ova dea!!"}
{"text":"Always here for get da good poke. They also get rice! Now u can make one real poke bowl! Lol! All jokes aside they have da aloha spirit, always greeting everyone when they walk in. Oh and da poke so ONO!!!!! Baga is action!"}
{"text":"Very good, simple and fresh poke served by nice people. They have many different flavors to choose from and the value is excellent. Definitely worth the trek away from the Strip to get a good take-out meal. It would have been nice if they had some seating so we could have eaten there, but I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love Poke!  This place has real deal awesome tuna poke island legit.  If you eat poke tuna come here for sure!

Get here early so you can try samples, otherwise they only make to order.  Every poke is awesome, it's all great.

Service was super awesome!  Island folks are super friendly.

We'll be back, any chance we have."}
{"text":"Hidden gem....Wow! Ask Micah for the bomb sauce!! Get the tuna of course but the mussels r awesom too! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Their poke is always super fresh and onolish! The workers are very nice and friendly bringing da \"Aloha spirit\" to Henderson."}
{"text":"Seriously the best poke in town! I just left Maui a week ago. And with the craving of poke as always, I found this gem in the middle of last night going through Yelp, gave it a try today, and it was worth EVERY PENNY. He guy helped me gave me samples because I didn't know what to choose, very friendly and helpful. No complains, except I could've gotten more poke home instead of just half a pound. Gone in minutes. Rice was cooked perfectly and can't forget furikake on top(;"}
{"text":"There are two locations and this one is located inside Island Sushi.  It's smaller and they don't offer as many items as the Craig Road location.  However, they offer the same quality of Poke.  I ordered the Furikake Poke and Salmon Poke and both were delicious.  Their fish is fresh and very flavorful.  This definitely satisifed my Poke craving while I was in Vegas.  

Since it's located inside Island Sushi, you can also order a local plate or some Malasadas for dessert."}
{"text":"I just had to try this place after reading all the awesome reviews, upon a recent trip to Vegas.  There are two locations of Poke Express and this one is located inside a small strip mall north of The Strip.   If you like Poke as much as I do, your taste buds are in for a treat.  This location is inside a small strip mall just north of The Strip.

The fish is fresh and so delicious.  They have a good variety of Poke and Banchan dishes, so take your time as you make your selections.  They also have a couple of container sizes, which allows you to order more of a variety, which is what I did.  

The staff were super friendly and very nice.  I ordered the Wasabi Ahi, Spicy Ahi, Salmon and Lomi Lomi Salmon.  My taste buds were in heaven after one bite.  Since I can't eat Poke without rice, I walked a few doors down to 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate to add to my awesome meal.  Definitely worth a trip if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Southern Nevada is a great region and North Las Vegas is a great place to live in and it's due to great places such as Poke Express. The customer service alone has a small town charm to it. They truly love their art and appreciate their customers. Everyone behind the counter is friendly and willing to go the extra mile for you every time. Sometimes I stop and wonder, do I come here for the amazing fresh poke or the warm friendly service?

I have had an opportunity to try seven different delightful dishes and I love them all equally. I recommend this place to a Hawaiian friend of mine and his answer was, \"I make my own,\" I thought his answer interesting. On many occasions at Poke Express, if what they have out does not meet their standards they will make you a new batch. Even if you are the last customer there. I love this place and I am not alone...come in and visit our town."}
{"text":"We ordered from the Island Sushi menu first.  I got a mini garlic chicken, my boyfriend got a bento box  (teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef, rice, and noodles).  Because it was quite a busy Friday night, I walked over to Poke Express and order 1/4 lb of Furikake Ahi Poke to munch on while waiting for our food.

The Ahi Poke was tasty, but alright.  The same thing can be said about the main orders.  The garlic chicken was ok, however I didn't care for neither the teriyaki beef or chicken on my boyfriend's bento box order.. nothing about the food really blew us away.

The place is really small.  I'm surprised we were able to get a table.  Since they were pretty busy that night, there was a wait to get a table in the sushi section.  

Overall I'm glad I tried the hype.. but wasn't impressed enough to become a repeat visitor."}
{"text":"If your are into Ahi Tuna this I am place to visit. You come in choose which tuna you want to enjoy and you are on your way. Very flavorful. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"this place is top fish in terms of poke. vast variety of tako, ahi, and crab poke. they even have dried aku, opihi, and hanalei poi. their poke is something I can eat everyday no joke. I read a review saying they would drive four an a half hrs for this poke and I would agree, this is one of those places that driving for hrs is worth the reward cause their poke is crazy good and would highly. ..HIGHLY!! Recommend them to anyone! I go there weekly and their specials is mean!! poke bowls, cone sushi, maki sushi. dis is one place you cannot go wrong, da people is awesome and you can tell they have the aloha spirit and it shows in the food they make! Mahalos for bringing a piece of home to las vegas Poke Express!"}
{"text":"We love Poke Express! Most of their poke is around $15/lb which is for me very good prices! The ingredients are top notch. Service is great! We go to Poke Express weekly."}
{"text":"This place has the freshest poke I have ever had. There are many different types to choose from. They will let you try all of them to help you make a selection.Be forewarned though, they sell out fast of some of the varieties, so if you want to taste, go early. If you know what you want they will make it to order. My favorite is the shoyu. Delicious!!! They also have many types of Mochi and who doesn't love that? The guys behind the counter are so friendly and laid back. There is definitely an island vibe to the place."}
{"text":"Some of the best poke I've ever had! Try their baby octopus, take limit, spicy avocado tuna! They have a wide variety of poke to try :)"}
{"text":"Now that poke & sushi burritos are getting popular in Vegas.. Poke Express has always been my favorite poke place in town versus any other place! Even if it is quite a drive for me..Big fan of the spicy mayo tuna."}
{"text":"As good as it gets. 

This place transported me back to Hawaii. These guys do one thing and they do it right--make the best poke in Las Vegas. 

The variety is unrivaled, and you don't have to worry about picking the right kind. The owner, Darren, was so kind that he let my wife and me try about a dozen different samples before ordering. In fact, he told us he doesn't care if we order or not, so long as we left satisfied. What a sales pitch! I mean, seriously? Leave without buying any poke after sampling how delicious it all was? Get outta here!

I will continue to make the hour long round-trip drive to this place as often as possible. Worth every minute. 

TIP: On Monday and Tuesday, from 10am to 2pm, you can order your choice of poke over fresh, delicious rice (I believe with furikake) for only $6.99."}
{"text":"After already gorging myself with a pound of poke from another location, I decided to head to this place at 3pm. The nice lady at the counter gave me samples of a lot of their items. The Tuna, Salmon, Tako are all very fresh! The octopus has that proper crunchy taste to it (not mushy and rubbery like other places aaagh!!) and you can literally hear every crunch when you munch! 

So I ended up going with 1 pound of hawaiian style and 1 pound wasabi style. Sure its a good 30 min drive from me but well worth it, especially when they keep giving me samples after samples!

My order came out to be $20.30 to be exact, and while I am saving these tubs for dinner, I think I am going to have another peek under the lid :)

Nice clean store, friendly service, they got a nice fish tank too.

5 stars"}
{"text":"Such a great place! Great quality, so fresh! Love the variety of snacks, etc. that they have as well. 
Fantastic customer service!"}
{"text":"Poke Express is my favorite discovery in Vegas. It's a little bit outside out of the way, but soo worth it -- i promise!

This is my first time trying poke, and I am addicted. My bf and I came here when it first opened and the guy was super welcoming and nice; he persistently insist that we try everything. I always feel uncomfortable asking for too many samples, but not here! All the fresh tuna and seafood salads were super fresh and delicious. My bf and I had the hardest time narrowing what we want. 

We ended up getting the spicy ahi poke, shoyu poke, and sweet & chili poke. We came on the day where they have their rice bowl special for $2 extra. So we got two rice bowls and about 1 lb of fresh, raw tuna for about $20 -- a serious steal. Just compare that to a sushi meal. 

Poke Express is a family-owned business from Hawaii so they sure know their poke. Come here and support your local business -- because these guys are super friendly and are offering some bomb a** seafood for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I still freakin' love this place!  After having been at least 6 times now, I can still say that they are da bomb.  Favorites, I can now say, is the salmon poke, furikake tuna poke, and the spicy combo poke and always with the ocean salad and  a scoop of white rice.  The flavors are still good and the freshness and cuts have never let me down. During our latest visit we tried their newest one: tuna in Misoyaki sauce. Yeah, that was good too.  Always worth the drive off the strip.  Just go!"}
{"text":"Amazingggggggg. The customer service was friendly the food was high quality seafood etc. the flavors were pungent in all the best way! I cannot wait to go back I am only in town for work but will come at least once a week while I'm here that is how impressed I am. I love how it's to-go, it's a neat idea!! Great prices too"}
{"text":"I had the Kim Chee ahi poke and the spicy wasabi ahi poke for the first time here! Both were extremely fresh and tasty!! I would definitely recommend this place to poke lovers!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time I have eaten at Poke Express. I have to say I was highly impressed with the selection (10-12 variations) and willingness to provide samples for me to get exactly what I wanted. They have a very courteous staff and the food was delicious! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just went there. And loved it! First of all is very clean and everyone is super friendly. The prices are very good. They give you samples so you can find out the one you like. I'll be coming back for sure.  There were other choices i couldnt fit in my 2 choice bowl. Try the wasabi tako. So good !"}
{"text":"Now this is what you call poke.  This place puts the poke bowl places popping up around town to shame.  If you want authentic poke you get it from here.  Want it in a bowl?  Yes they sell rice!!!   Every time I come here they are so nice and they let you sample their selection.  Great perk is that they also sell ahi sashimi with the colemans hot mustard and shoyu mixed for you.   Mmmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about their poke.  The fish is fresh and flavorful.  Glad we can get real deal poke here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Poke Express is a family owned and operated poke shop which offers super fresh island-style seafood and other products.  My family and I were so excited to hear about their opening and even more thrilled after we met the owners and experienced their aloha.  My daughter asks for poke instead of McDonald's.  Imagine that!

So far, our favorites are:
Hawaiian-style ahi poke
Ahi Limu poke
Spicy Tuna 
Spicy Edimame
Imitation Crab salad

We also bought and enjoyed Zippy's Coconut Napples, Hawaiian Sun drinks, and some pork manapua's. All were ONO!

The only problem with Poke Express?  They're closed on Wednesdays!  Now we can't get poke seven days a week! 

Highly recommended- guaranteed to please!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Very Hawaii like. Poke bowl was very fresh it reminded me of the poke bowls that I was getting from Foodland in Mililani Hawaii. I will definitely come back each time the other awesome thing is that they ask you if your military or prior service and you get a discount not something that they should do but I believe that you caring for  Service members is always a big plus. Thank you guys for awesome good poke."}
{"text":"If you're looking this place up, just go. But know that it's INSIDE of  Island Sushi. Don't spend ten minutes arguing with your GPS in their parking lot. There's a sticker on the door. 

Poke is delicious, and these guys do it right. My favorites are the ahi-avocado or the salmon poke, but they also have a spicy crab dish that is tasty too. They also offer \"ocean salad\" AKA seaweed salad, which is simpler but also one of my favorite things. I haven't worked up the courage to try the raw tako yet!

Pricing is fair for the great quality. If you live on the other side of town like I do, buy twice as much as you think you want because driving across town is a pain in the butt but you'll do it for this poke. Speak up and ask to try before you buy, the guys are friendly and want to make sure you get something you'll love."}
{"text":"The poke here is pretty yummy, but I feel the price is just waaaaaay too much. I usually get the ahi poke with limu or the spicy avocado ahi, or shoyu ahi poke. I do have to say that the customer service is welcoming and friendly and they let you sample any poke, which I did once and made me figure out that I'm not into tako poke. I'll stick with the ahi poke!"}
{"text":"Well, what to say... Almost all the reviewers have hit the nail on the head.  If you love poke, think you might want to try poke, don't event know what poke is - go to Poke Express and fall in love with some of the best poke on the planet.  And great prices to boot.

If its your first time, its a little confusing to figure out - since its really 3 restaurants under one roof.  Only problem is their hours - they close too early"}
{"text":"This restaurant surprised and dazzled my friends with the poke bowl, of which they all said they wanted to order after they tried a little of mine (I'm thankful that they didn't try to take more of mine, because they were staring at it like a pack of wolves until their orders were ready).  The portion size for the poke bowl was large, but definitely did not have the gigantic piles of rice and meat that the traditional Haiwaiian BBQ places and dishes (this place included) have.  But that's ok, because it was enough for me to finish without feeling like I was bloated with excess rice and macaroni salad.  In any case, would come here again just for the poke bowl.  I might even order their ahi poke, because the poke was pretty fresh."}
{"text":"In the midst of all the poke bowl craziness, Poke Express is the real deal. It doesn't need to floof things up with an assembly line of fish scoops and a gazillion sauces. No, here you will only find real hawaiian poke. 

It is basically a market with premade poke, and you order by the pound. They also have rice (and furikake) that you can buy. I've definitely bought poke and rice and driven across the street to the park to enjoy my food. The guys there have been very very patient with me and my friends. Feel free to ask them for recommendations/samples. My favorite is definitely the salmon poke. I find that that one tends to sell out the quickest. You can also call in ahead to save yourself a portion! (Sometime on the phone beat me to the last of the salmon poke before...so I now I know LOL)

I wish they would open a location closer to me in Summerlin, but for quality poke, Poke Express is still worth the long drive."}
{"text":"I love poke, but there really aren't any places on my side of town to get it. When I find myself in the North side area for work, I always stop here to grab a couple pounds. The Hawaiian, avocado, and spicy pokes are solid options. I have had the lomi lomi salmon a couple of times and once it was packed with fish accented with tomatoes, but other times it has been more like pico de gallo with the occasional piece of fish- not consistent. Stick to the poke!

No room to dine in, rice available until they run out. Some additional Hawaiian foods/snacks are available for purchase in the refrigerators and shelves. Service is friendly and efficient, there is often a line but it moves quick."}
{"text":"This is the only place i buy my Poke. it's in North Las Vegas but its close to the 15. It really taste like home and always fresh. Owner is really  nice and if you dont see it just ask they make it in the back fresh."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS LEGIT!!! WORTH THE TRIP FOR ALL THE HYPE!!! 

Seriously, so my godbro has been here many times and I always see his check ins. I was in Vegas recently for his wedding and we came here two days after.  If you want a variety of fresh tasting poké! This place is thee spot! I know where I'm going the next time I'm in Vegas!!! Plus it's a Hawaiian food place so you can get your loco mocos and spam masubi's too! Plus on the other side of the wall they serve all you can eat sushi too! Oh AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND they have oxtail soup too!!! I didn't get it cause I saw the advertisement AAAAFTER I had already orders my food! #FAIL there's always next time!!! 

Oh yeah and totally affordable too! Haha that's always good info."}
{"text":"Best poke place I've found in Vegas!! Tried many many places within a year of living here. Hands down the best so far!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience till today. After spending over $70 I wasn't expecting to get a little surprise in the kulolo I ordered."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the short drive off of the strip. Poke is amazing. Loco moco is amazing. Prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Great food, I love seafood and this place hit the spot. I was expecting it to be a sit down place, but no worries the food is what mattered and the owner was pretty nice guy. Thats gonna be my spot everytime im in lv."}
{"text":"Went here after my workout for this first time today... bomb!! The poke is fresh and good bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best poke place I have ever been in Las Vegas. I come here at least once a week. Everything is delicious, they let you sample items before you buy, and everything is extremely fresh. The Ahi Tuna is extremely tender and delicious the way it should be. I love their kimchi cucumbers too. My favorites are the sweet chili ahi poke and the spicy avocado Ahi. I guarantee you that you will not become disappointed if you visit this place. The people that work there are also very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem I swear! Their food is soOoo yummy! The Garlic Chicken flavorful.  I also tried  the furikake poke which was marinated perfectly!  Deserts were deli. as well.  This place is so addicting, I went back the next day!  Love this place, it definitely brings out the Hawaiian culture in the food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing  I live in summerlin and it takes about 30-40 minutes to get here but it is definitely worth the drive. I always get the salmon poke, spicy mayo poke, and the shoyu poke. The poke is always fresh and delicious and the people are very friendly in helping you decide what you want if you're unsure. Love this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We always do all you can eat sushi and sit at the sushi bar. The staff is super friendly and very good at what they do. My husband is from Hawaii and is a chef and enjoys they're aloha spirit and they're island music and staff, poke, sushi and Malasada as he would say \"broke da mouth\" shoots bra"}
{"text":"Bomb! Anything you get here is pretty fresh and delicious! Some of my favorites are the Spicy Sake Poke (with Masago and Mayo) and the Ahí Tuna Poke. The store also carries and sells different ingredients that you wouldn't normally find at a regular grocery store. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. 

They don't really have a place for you to sit down and eat. You just pick up and go."}
{"text":"Love poke! I think I was seriously Hawaiian in my passed life. Lol best poke I've had in Vegas or anywhere else that was not hawaii! Always fresh! 

They have great poke bowls deals if you don't want to eat your poke by itself. 

My favorites is kimchee crab salad, shoyu poke and wasabi poke!

The owners have always been very friendly and courteous. 

Defiantly one of my favorite lunch spots!"}
{"text":"What you don't understand is since I left Hawaii 8 years ago I've been looking for a decent poke place. Well this place is not decent at all! - 
Poke Express is Amazing. So close to poke from home I'm so floored! It's Da Bomb!
I went from looks to taste to flavor.

Look's- It is poke like it should be. Looks fresh like it was made in the morning.

Taste - So close to local kine back home in Hawaii. Talk about it might even compete with them.

Flavor - The taste is to die for. It's so much flavor and bang for Vegas. 

I recommend this to everyone who likes raw fish and for everyone who is missing the Hawaiian Poke with some good beer.."}
{"text":"Love this place. My fiancé and I come here all the time. Our all time favorite is the salmon poke with the special sauce. We also get the spicy ahi and the crab salad. Whatever we get, it's all delicious. Staff is very friendly. We will continue coming here. Love it!"}
{"text":"Yummy and always fresh. If they run out, they don't hesitate to make to order. Our faves are spicy ahi and tako kimchi."}
{"text":"Stop here every time I'm in Vegas. Great options, fresh and tasty! They also do military discount! I believe it's $2 or $3 off per pound. You can get as small as 1/3 a pound. No sitting area. They don't always have rice but there is a teriyaki place a couple stores down that sells rice."}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews. we had to try Poke Express when we visited Las Vegas. If you are a fan of Poke, this place will not disappoint.

The location is set up like a deli counter with a couple of refrigerators and a rack of Hawaiian specialty items for sale. We were only familiar with one type of Poke, so our server was quick to provide samples and recommendations. 

We bought the spicy ahi, the furikake ahi, the kimchee octopus and the limu ahi. The furikake was our favorite, with its mild sweetness from the oyster sauce."}
{"text":"Been a customer ever since this opend. Never disappointed. Alway a great vibe here. This is the only joint that brings me closer to home, its like I never left the island when im here. Anyways just 5 start because this place has the best Poke."}
{"text":"Their salmon poke with the special sauce is the best!  Every time I visit Las Vegas, I will always get a couple pounds of the stuff whenever I'm heading back to Orange County.  And even though that sounds like a lot, I'll polish it all off in a couple days or less.  I also love their cucumber kimchi.

I always pick up a couple things to eat on the drive back too, usually the mochiko chicken and the loco moco.  There is nowhere in the OC (or even LA) that makes loco moco nearly as good.  The Loft and L&L, in particular, should hang their heads in shame.  The gravy is dark and rich and flavorful and portion-size is huge.  They sell a few desserts as well, a real stand-out is the butter mochi."}
{"text":"So yummy! This poke never disappoints!  They have a Military discount for larger orders! Perfect for holidays and family dinners!"}
{"text":"Any time we are craving poke, this is our first choice!! Plus they have many different items from Hawaii!! The poke always taste sooo ONO!!! The staff and owners are amazing so much Aloha Spirit!!!"}
{"text":"The Original Vegas poke joint before poke became a craze. Serves fresh poke all the time. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I love poki so much!!
This restaurant has a lot choice!!
Price is good!! I will go back again soon."}
{"text":"Sorry guys but this was very disappointing. The rice in my bowl was hard, there was hardly any salmon, the pork in the Hawaiian bowl was just insipid. I was expecting something more in the lines of Sweet Poke style place and this was not it. 
Friendly staff, clean and quick."}
{"text":"Hands down, best Poke I've ever had. I try to make it to Poke express whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best Poke in Las Vegas with so much to choose from! Also they can make any variety you are looking for and they will let you sample any of the Poke you are interested in. Check them out and you will see how good they are! They will treat you like family! Mahalo!"}
{"text":"I drove here because everyone was recommending this place to me. Their Spicy salmon is terrible all it has is massago and their spicy sauce it's additional for unions and green onions. The prices here is expensive just for their poke. Long wait just for 1-2 orders. Definitely not worth the long wait for poke that is not fresh. I will not be returning here. Do not recommend this poke shop."}
{"text":"Great quality and price for something you cant find just anywhere. I even like Poke Express Poke's over some of the places back home Hawaii! and that says a lot!!!!"}
{"text":"Poke heaven! These folks really understand. I tasted my way through many of their selections, all delicious. They are so patient. Finally got a lot of kimchee style tako poke, plus of course ahi shoyu poke. Made me want to go back to Hawaii, um, how about go back to LV? Now that I found them, I can eat lunch here and then go to 888, a few doors down, later. Both have made me forget about buffets."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! I drive 15 miles just to eat here. Fresh, clean, and freindly"}
{"text":"I was browsing Las Vegas Yelp, when I saw \"Poke Express\" at the top of my restaurant list. Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to find a poke shop in Vegas (okay North Las Vegas), much less on Yelp! 

Since I was leaving for LA, I decided to stop by and get a snack for the road. I managed to get there one minute before they closed. One of their employees was outside having a smoke, and I guess he could tell that I was there for the poke, because when I got out of the car he said \"you here for da poke?\" I nodded and he said \"you have one minute!\"

Inside, Poke Express has the standard refrigerated deli case filled with different varieties of poke, and a fridge stocked with Hawaiian Sun and other goodies. All of the tuna poke had already been sold, but they offered to make some to order and let me try some of the tako poke while I waited. 

I had the ahi limu poke, the spicy ahi poke and the kimchee tako poke. In theory, I was only going to eat one of them on my ride home, and had the rest packed on ice. But in reality, it was all so good, that I had eaten all of them (3/4 pound total) before I hit the stateline.

Edit: Oh, the fish quality was a bit mushy. I'm not sure if this was because this was the end of the day, or if their fish is frozen. I didn't have enough time to ask the provenance of their fish. That being said, it was still delicious, and I'm not going to knock them for that."}
{"text":"Great Ahi Tuna Poke! This is our favorite pre-workout meal spot!  Very friendly and very casual."}
{"text":"One of the best poke spots in town. I recently found out they do a lunch special which includes two types of fish with rice for about 10 bucks. Considering the quality of fish you'll get here it's a steal of a deal! There has been a recent influx of poke places in town but those bowls can have a lot going on. If you're a raw fish enthusiast like I am you will definitely appreciate this place. I also decided to venture out and picked up some sweet chili mussels. I got about one third of a pound of this stuff which cost me about 3 dollars. It was the perfect compliment to my poke plate and the flavor was amazing!! As a fellow Hawaii transplant, this poke makes me feel like I'm right back home. Quick and friendly service is the cherry on top."}
{"text":"So they offer a good selection of island styled poke here! They also bring in a lot of other product from Hawaii to make any island transplant feel right at home here in Vegas with some of there most favorite comfort foods. From lau lau, Portuguese sausage, and even poi! The prices here are reasonable especially for being out here in Vegas. I totally recommend Poke Express for any islander looking to fulfill there need of island styled poke and other local cravings! The area it is in is not hard to find and there is ALOT of parking. The staff here is definitely friendly and more then willing to answer any questions you may have or even products they might or could bring in from back home."}
{"text":"Poke express is a definite stop for authentic Hawaiian food. It is located inside the Island Sushi and Grill restaurant. If you like Poke, this is the best in Las Vegas. It is set up at it's own counter, and offers about a dozen different varieties, each one extremely fresh and tasty. You can also request a free sample before you make a purchase. I usually stick with salmon and tuna poke, however i have been tasting different varieties such as mussel poke kimchee style which was delicious and fresh. There is also a grilled section which offers traditional Hawaiian favorites such as kahlua pig and cabbage, loco moco, and many others that are my husband's favorites. They also have a bakery section."}
{"text":"I love this place. I finally got to try it out on our last trip to Vegas. Located way off strip, we stopped in for lunch before our flight back home. 

We had a hard time finding it at first because we were looking for a Poke Express sign, but it's really in the same shop as the Island Grill restaurant which has also a Japanese place attached to it. I think it says it on the door at least.

We went in for poke, but ended up getting ahi and tako poke, fried saimin, loco moco, side of garlic chicken, AND a custard malasada. LOL yes I had to try everything. Loved the poke, saimin was OKAY, fiance LOVED the loco moco (they have brown rice btw), and we both really like the garlic chicken. Malasada was good. Just made me miss hawaii.

Overall we will be back! Credit cards accepted. Parking lot available but packed."}
{"text":"Spicy ahi combo.. i LOOOOVE. if you really like spicy ahi, you must try this!!!! i really also like their limu poke, perfect seasoning!"}
{"text":"Best poke in Las Vegas! No discussion needed. 

Don't be deceived by the strip mall. This isn't a restaurant, it's a small market that serves up the best poke in town. Grab some on your way to the beach for energy to surf. Oh wait. It's so good, you'll think you're on the Islands. Seriously.

Just tried the dried seasoned Aku. Wow! So tender and flavorful. Better than beef jerky.

Wasabi Ahi poke is still my favorite. Not too spicy, packed with flavor, Ahi melts in your mouth. Get it with the sauce on top.

My stomach says mahalo!"}
{"text":"Closest thing to getting Poke from the islands without traversing the Pacific..."}
{"text":"Hawaii in Las Vegas??? The food here BROK' DA MOUT. This is my new favorite spot in Las Vegas. If you're staying at the big casinos, then you'll need a car to get here. I came here for lunch and ordered the ahi/avocado bowl. The last time I had one of these gems was on the Big Island and it was just as good, if not better. Knowing that we weren't going to have dinner until 10pm, my companion and I also ordered Bento boxes to go. I'm glad we did. I ordered the beef teriyaki with mochiko chicken. I haven't had mochiko chicken since a real Hawaiian made it for me years ago. My partner had the mahi mahi and teriyaki chicken and thought the latter was prepared well, but the mahi mahi was on the dry side. Surprisingly, the mahi mahi was NOT overcooked. Am I comin' back? You betcha. I'm pickin' up some food for my road trip back to \"Cali\" which is how people in Las Vegas (and probably elsewhere) refer to my home state. Lastly, I want to add that the man who served our food when it was ready was professional and courteous."}
{"text":"Anyone looking for some true poke to eat can find it here, at Poke Express!

You don't understand how long I've been searching to find the best poke in Los Angeles. After being introduced to it in college, the only place I knew about was Tommy's Sushi in Tustin. Fast forward 15 years and places are starting to pop up. Being in Vegas, this was the first place I trekked to.

This place is your traditional poke, where they have many varieties. Tako, Ahi, Salmon, shrimp in various poke styles. This place is similar to Hawaii where you buy it in containers and take it home and eat it with rice. 

My favorites are the Spicy Salmon Poke, the Ahi Chili Water Poke, and the Shrimp Kimchee Poke. I like it tasty and with a kick. If you do too, I recommend those varieties. 

You can go down to the other end of the plaza and buy your rice at 808 since they two restaurants are family joined.

If you have never tried poke before, you are in for a treat. If you love sushi, I guarantee  you will love poke, especially the ones at Poke House. Traditional food, traditional people, reasonable prices. This is now on my top 10 list!"}
{"text":"This is a REAL poke bowl. It's nice to have a place to get poke that reminds me of home! I get the spicy ahi mayo and ahi limu poke. If you're looking for real Hawaiian-style poke this is definitely the spot."}
{"text":"Another gem of a local business here in North Las Vegas! It's always been a bookmark of mine, but I've never been able to stop by! I've recently gone back (3 times in a month and a half) and went back to see what new combination they've come up with!

I really enjoy the freshness of their poke and it really takes you back to Hawai'i if you've ever been! I love their customer service and small talk whenever I come in to order! The couple who owns the joint is extremely cool to talk to! My favorite is their Spicy Avocado Ahi Poke-- your perfect combination of spice and sweetness from the raw Ahi tuna! I also found their selection of different kinds of poke I never knew existed like the mussels poke! If you aren't a seafood person, I don't recommend the place, but if you know someone who loves seafood with an island twist to it, let 'em know that there's a place in North Las Vegas that serves it fresh and unique!

Their generous helpings of samples and willingness to have you try their newest inventions gives Poke Express the 5-star rating! As you can tell from my previous reviews, I'm not easy to give a 5-star rating, so don't take the rating lightly! Majority of exceptional places get the 4, but \"unique and original with excellent customer service\" gives it that 5!

So, HI-5 to Poke Express! I'll be back soon enough!"}
{"text":"I only went here to because it was near my barber shop, and needless to say I now have a reason to get my haircut more often now. The food is amazing and the workers are extremely friendly and willing to help you when you're  curious about anything."}
{"text":"Confusing to get to. It's actually inside another restaurant in a plaza. There was a small group of 5 ppl waiting for the server to help them. 

They were out of some of the poke. After coming back from Hawaii, these didn't look as appetizing. 

I came here based on the Yelp review ratings looking to fulfill my poke craving. 

Sorry, but I'll keep trying another place. I might come back earlier in the day."}
{"text":"My favorite poke spot. Authentic and it really feels like home. It's like orgasmic in the mouth."}
{"text":"I continue to be impressed by their consistency of delivering awesome poke. We visit at least 3-4 times per month and we can't get enough. Friendly Hawaiian service and fresh clean fish. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"I drove across town one Saturday morning to fulfill my poke cravings, and without hesitation I would make the 25 minute trek to this place again and again. Poke Express is tucked in the corner of a large strip mall, to the left of Big Lots. 

The service was great. I was the first and only customer, walking in just 2 minutes after they opened. I hear they get busy, and they can easily run out of popular items, so that is why I went super early. The guy working the counter was friendly and helpful. We talked briefly about how we both live in Summerlin, and I told him they should open up a PE out there. He smiled, but did not confirm. I was offered samples of anything I wanted and after some debate, I finally decided to take home 1/4 pound of each:
Spicy ahi poke (spicy mayo, masago)
Salmon poke with special sauce (salmon, white onion, sauce)
Spicy avocado poke (ahi, avocado, spicy special sauce)

I spent around $25 which I thought was very reasonable for fresh fish. The spicy ahi poke was probably my favorite of the 3, however I would probably switch it up for salmon next time. I really don't have any other poke to compare this to, as I have only eaten Poke from Poke Express, but it was very good. The only bad thing is they don't have anywhere to sit inside so I had to eat in my car, for shame!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is always on point. They offer you samples and I love how I can talk pidgin to them because they are all from Hawaii. I try to cover up my pidgin, but when I visit them it naturally comes out.

Now when it comes to the food, everything here is so Ono (tasty). They marinate their fish just like back home in Hawaii and the way it's displayed is just like a poke/fish market as well. 

My favorites have been the spicy ahi, salmon poke with special sauce, ahi limu (seaweed), and wasabi tako! 

Also try their garlic bulbs, it is so tasty!

My mouth is watering while I wait in line to order my food! 

5/5"}
{"text":"I just stumbled across this place driving. When I walked in I was greeted with smiling, friendly people. They asked if this was my first time in, when I said yes they wanted me to sample everything they had. After many samples I came out with 4 items. Awesome FRESH Poke. This place is awesome!!! Definitely a must for the poke fan!!!"}
{"text":"UM YEA THIS PLACE IS LEGIT! I walked in and I said this smells like HOME (referring to Hawaii aka our second home) I love it.  We got there around 5pm which is towards closing time but don't worry they will make whatever you want for you. 

Poke here is just like what we can get in Hawaii which I really appreciate since the new poke craze is all about \"making your own bowl\" 

I feel like poke should be served marinated over some hot rice and poke express offer just that. Amazing food and friendly service.

Will be back when in Vegas next time :)"}
{"text":"Best poke I've had since Hawaii! I recommend to anyone looking for that authentic island flavor! My favorite was the kimchi taco (octopus) poke."}
{"text":"I really don't know much about poke, but I know good food when I taste it.

Besides the extremely helpful and friendly service here, the poke is pretty darn delicious. I have had the chance to try a few of the poke flavors: furikake, spicy mayo with tomago, and the spicy avocado. All have been very good. Each runs around $16.99 per lb, which can get pricey, though a 1/2 lb is already a lot of poke.

Some words of advice given to us by the owner: Come early when they open so that you can try all the flavors behind the counter. Later in the day, they don't have all the flavors available in the counter and instead the poke is made to order.

I was very impressed by the variety of other poke available such as the types of tako available. Got to come back to try em all."}
{"text":"Great place! I was surprised to see the variety, everything looked fresh and delicious. Don't confuse it with the regular poke place though - this is authentic stuff! They may not have fancy toppings like many \"modern\" house but you cannot beat the quality of their food. I can't wait to explore every item on their menu"}
{"text":"my girlfriend and i decided to venture out for brunch while visiting my parents... came across this poke spot and was amazed by the quality of poke... besides the poke... beyond friendly staff! this is our new island fix spot... plus was referee to a restaurant down the way called 808HMP (Hawaii Mixed Plate) time for some loco moco!!! Mahalo @PokeExpress"}
{"text":"Fish salad anyone?? That what poke is though in Hawaiian cuisine. Sound funny but poke is cut up raw yellowfin tuna, octopus, or salmon. Typically, it comes as in various forms just like most salads like fruit or vegetable salads. Typically, raw fish chopped up mixed with a variety of greens, seaweed, onions, tomatoes (Hold it),  shoyu, garlic, etc. You get the picture. This is great stuff to eat if you're on a diet. 

Poke Express has two locations in Las Vegas. One in north of the city and another south east. This location is a bit small and is more of a market of Hawaiian products than anything else. Definitely, it's not a place to eat at. Take this stuff to go. 

The folks here are truly Islanders with friendly laid back service. Worth a drive out if you're in this neck of the dessert. 

Now.. Time for a pork salad anyone??"}
{"text":"Poke are great.   Simply done and many variations including mussels, octopus,  and salmon all sold by the pound.   If you are in a hurry skip the cooked foods, it takes much too long.  They have a dessert that looks like little cream puffs, gross, much too sweet and artificial.   Stick to the poke and be happy."}
{"text":"I realize that I eat out often and get bored with the same old thing.  I love to try all different kinds of cuisine and love to share my experiences with others that love to eat and enjoy food as I do.

Poke Express is ONOLICIOUS!   The selection is vast and if you can't find what you like, the helpful staff will make it up for you.  I selected the traditional Hawaiian style Tuna Poke.  

I also picked up an order of Kahlua Pig with the Mac Salad and Rice.  It was very tasty but a bit salty.  

For anyone who wants a taste of Hawaii check out Poke Express or right next door Island Sushi."}
{"text":"Coming here for the first time, the workers were very knowledgable and generous with sampling their pokes. 

I had the salmon poke ahi poke with seaweed, and brown rice without furikake. I had to stay away from the poke mixed with black sesame seeds for I am deathly allergic. All the fish tasted very fresh and not fishy and old. 

For dessert, my friend bought this taro-like dessert mixed in coconut milk. I thought it was very interesting!

Too bad there aren't tables to dine-in, but I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow... super fresh fish! Walking into this tiny spot you 1st realize something.... No smell what so ever was present. 1st cue that this place takes pride in what they serve. Also it was immaculate inside. Long counter / case of super fresh items. The young man behind the counter was super friendly and willing to help. They allow sampling and it is a good way to get you hooked. Had the Tako with shoyu and it was outstanding. Also got the spicy ahi which consisted of Japanese mayo and Sriracha which was very good. No tables to be found, but don't worry. Walk a few doors down, towards the opposite end of the strip mall that they sit in and you will find tables at 808 Hawaiian plate. If you buy a drink or even grab some food you can sit at this location and enjoy the food. My two choices of poke (1/3lb) each ran around $3.50. It was more then a sample and not a full meal which was great."}
{"text":"Similar to the Poke Express on Craig, this Eastern location just off the 215 freeway shares its home with Island Sushi Grill.....a small mom & pop style Hawaiian local joint that's a hit with Las Vegas locals and Hawaiian/Hawaiian food addicts alike. Poke comes as fresh as it gets for Vegas and then some. Ahi and Salmon are rich in flavor and texture that gives the first chewy feeling but melts like butter in your mouth. Friendly customer service all around. A plus side is food variety and malasadas at this location if you want other stuff other than poke... but that's another review."}
{"text":"Great tasting poke. Great pricing. Expect to take it to go. No seating. Recommend the spicy mayo ahi"}
{"text":"Wow! The selection was excellent! We loved the Wasabi Ahi and the Kimchi Tako.  Both were great!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME. Took a much-needed break from the strip and headed to Island Sushi and Grill/Poke Express for lunch. The place was packed with locals- GOOD SIGN. Service was very friendly. Ordered an ahi/avocado poke bowl and a mini mochiko chicken lunch from the front cashier. Picked up some furikake poke and some spicy ahi poke from the deli counter towards the back. EVERYTHING was perfect and super affordable- a combination rarely found in Vegas...

The MINI mochiko chicken ($5!) was great and enough to feed two easy. All of the poke was FRESH and delicious. Furikake poke was on point. Spent about $30 on enough food for 3 and leftovers. Chicago is pretty devoid of any Hawaiian food so I will for sure be coming back before I hit the airport...it's that good."}
{"text":"FRESH!!!!  I lived on an island for five years so I know fresh fish!  I can't believe how amazing this poke place is!  Hubs and I are obsessed!!!"}
{"text":"Love sushi? Love Poke to be more precise? Got that crave for that Hawaiian local flavor but living in the Desert of Sin City far far away from the fresh ocean? ... Look no further than Poke Express, your one stop shop for poke variety and then some. I honestly don't think there is any other place like poke express that offers the variety or poke and other seafood rawness fresh with flavor. Sure there are sushi places in town, and AYCE buffet that offer a little bit of poke but nothing like this.

If the idea of fresh raw delicacy is not your fancy, this place may not be your thing...but I don't think you would be reading this review if you didn't fancy it! Pretty much every choice is a hit maker. My favorites are the spicy mayo ahi and spicy mayo salmon...though you have to request it for the Salmon....with no problem at all. Ahi limu are subtle but great. Eat it as is, or with rice as a meal or your favorite side dish for snacks. 

Price can get up there with all the choices as per pound can be around $14.99, come in with a military id can receive $2.00 off and if you buy 5 pounds I believe there is a discount off Es h pound as well.

For what it is in the city of sinful desert...it sure is close to Purely Poke Perfection. Nothing else comes close in town...let alone there is nothing else.

P.S. - be sure to come early as they tend to run out towards end of the day and closing time on select poke especially Salmon Poke!"}
{"text":"I'm dreaming of being on a sandy beach near Kona, Hawaii and craving Da Poke Shack and so sad it's not real, but BAM, here come Poke Express with the exact same thing! Total Score & totally worth the drive anytime I'm craving poke. The only thing that made me sad was no rice when I came in (not sure if they ever have it). 

The poke here is really good & can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Good selection of poke. Fresh and flavorful. 
They also serve some some hot dishes. The oxtail soup is delicious. 
Definitely recommended to all the poke fans!!!"}
{"text":"First time yesterday and second time today! The quality exceeds the prices compared to the pre-built poke places here in Henderson and when I lived in the Bay Area. Super helpful and cheery staff both times. Don't miss out on the yummy offerings in the fridge. Personal favorite is the Salmon Ponzu Poke!"}
{"text":"So I have been wanting to go to this place due to the reviews on here and I finally got to go today. It was my first time trying ahi poke but knew I'd like it because I LOVE seafood. Well this place does NOT disappoint! The guy who was there was SO nice and pretty much gave me samples of all of the types. I loved the avocado ahi poke and not to mention the ocean salad was to die for! I could eat that salad all the time! Price was very reasonable to add!"}
{"text":"I asked my hubby to get Poké from here, specifically, the garlic ahi. Good thing he wanted a couple other different kinds as well. What can you tell from this picture? The garlic ahi is the only one that isn't red in color. Not only is it not red, it's actually turning brown! You know, like when you see meat going bad? The garlic masks the smell but the taste and texture, you can't mask that. I give 2 stars because the other 2 were decent. Disappointing. If I was there, I definitely wouldn't have gotten it."}
{"text":"Yum! Me and the hubs tried the poke with shoyu, the spicy poke and something else that I can't remember. 

HOLY YUM. Can't go wrong with any of the poke that they have....and I'm from Hawaii :)"}
{"text":"THE SASHIMI DEAL OF THE CENTURY!!!
I hang out with a couple of Enlightened dudes (and yes, they are the real deal) and the other day as we were chewing on the Dharma one of them said, \"I'm going to show you a place that is going to blow your mind, and I mean, really blow your mind.\" When an Enlightened being tells you that, you better hold onto your ego (if you wanna keep it, that is) 'cause mind-blowing is their forte. But how many times have I heard \"I've got the BEST sushi place in the city!\" only to have it be a decent but standard restaurant?

Once we got to Poke Express, however, my mind WAS blown. Poke Express is not your typical sushi restaurant. Hell, it's not even a restaurant, it's more like a sushi deli. Scratch that, like a SASHIMI DELI! This place is run by a bunch of laid back Hawiians and they sling some of the best damn raw fish that I've ever put in my mouth. Poke is basically sashmi cut up into bitesized pieces and then dressed in various sauces. The Salmon was awesome (although I love it best when I squeeze a bunch of fresh lemon on it). The Ahi is incredible and can be prepared several different ways. I highly recommend Wasabi style and Hawiian style, but I can't imagine that any of the styles would be anything but lip-smacking GREAT.

You buy it in 1/2 lb and 1 lb containers. A half pound is great for lunch, but if you're a glutton, you can get 1/2 lb of one and 1/2 lb of the other and really pig out. \"But wait,\" you say, \"A POUND of sashimi? That's gonna break the bank!\" Au contraire, mon fraire! This uncooked sea dwelling yumminess goes for only $9.00 PER POUND. Yeah, I said PER POUND! Holy Hamachi, Batmansan, one could get THREE POUNDS OF SASHIMI for the price of an All You Can Eat sushi deal, and it's SASHIMI, not the rice laden sushi that we AYCE suchi buffs have to tolerate to get our little fishy friends down our gullet.

Friggin MAKE THE DRIVE to Craig and Revere and check this place out. Buy some for today and buy another container for lunch tomorrow. I'm going to be finding excuses to make it over to this part of town every chance I get. 

If Can, Can. If No Can, No Can!"}
{"text":"All I have to say it that this place is defo 5/5. Fresh fish. Delish. OMG, am I in Hawaii? Nope, it's north town.

Ordered the following: 
Ahi poke with furikake: 5/5 just like a regular poke, with it's usual seasonings but it comes with furikake. Comes with a kick of sweetness.

Ahi poke with limu: 5/5 Comes with seaweed. It's not bad, it's actually good! This one would be my fave!

Ahi poke with wasabi: 5/5 A kick of spiciness. Yum! Ok, I lied, this one is my fave.

Ahi poke (regular): 5/5 Obviously the regular version.

Fresh crab poke: 5/5 A little raw for me but if it's too raw you can always pan fry it for a quick minute or two. 

Service: Well, the guys need to up their game. STOP MUMBLING! I had a hard time understanding the guy who helped me. He was trying to explain to me what one of the pokes tastes like. I gave up. 

Would defo come back. I would come back on a hot summer day, buy poke and head to a pool. It'll like Hawaii but with fake water. Ha."}
{"text":"Note: strictly takeout. There's no tables or chairs. Fortunately there's a park right across the street :) 

Spicy poke is my favorite. Along with the ones that come with soy sauce (ones a seaweed one & another garlic I believe) 

Definitely love their lunch specials which come w/ furikake on rice. Unfortunately only available during the weekdays. 

I live pretty far from this place but I still manage to get here whenever I'm craving some poke. :)"}
{"text":"The best poke in town. Many choices for ahi and tako . There's a mini grocery too and dont forget to get hurricane popcorn. They serve bowls for lunch."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place. It is a bit pricey but hey...it's fresh Poké, so that makes it reasonable. Always fresh and always consistent in flavor. 

This establishment is only open from 
10am-6pm. It is an \"express\" place so there aren't tables or chairs like that, more like a pick up type of setting. 

My favorite is the Limu style Ahi Tuna with green onions and seaweed. If you love sashimi and fresh fish I definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"This place is way too far from me for me to come often, which is a shame because otherwise I could probably spend a lot of money here. 

They primarily carry ahi poke, but they also offer tako and salmon varieties, plus several other kinds of salads like seaweed and a creamy seafood one. The people behind the counter are exceptionally friendly and willing to offer you samples if you seem curious about a variety. 

There's also a selection of dried goods and two refrigerators/freezers filled with lumpia, meat skewers and other goodies.

I opted for a half pound of their sea salad, a half pound of ahi limu, a half pound of ahi wasabi and a tray of ahi sashimi that comes with a small pile of sea salad and lots of cabbage and sauce. The ahi was fresh and the dressings were tasty but the location is a bit of a downer since I'm on the opposite side of town. The prices are pretty reasonable considering it's fresh fish and the food is tasty, so if you're nearby definitely try it!"}
{"text":"So happy to find this little slice of Hawaiian heaven near me!  The poke is always fresh and delicious. 
We also get the salmon belly fillets ( for us) and salmon trimmings for our dogs! It's extremely fresh and they offer it on Mondays and Tuesdays ( till sold out).  The staff is friendly and it's always a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This place is clean, no fishy smells!  The poke is super fresh and delicious. Nice people working the place. We ordered 1/2 lb. each of Spicy Avocado Poke, Wasabi Ahi Poke, Tako Poke - Kimchee Style, and a Combo Poke Bowl. We had the sauce mixed in instead of on the side. This was shared by hubby and I. Everything we ordered was soooooooo good!  This is a believe the hype place. We were driving back on the freeway and had already finished almost 1 1/2 lbs of it, and regretting we didn't order more. Personally I think it tastes better than what I have had in Hawaii (sorry! :/) It may be the whole package that made it stand out because the place was clean, food super fresh and tasty, and guys were nice. Definitely worth the drive out if you're a Poke fan. Can't wait to get some more next time we visit."}
{"text":"\"Poke\" bowl action can never NEVER get old for me being from the 808. It kind of scary thinking the saturation of Poke across the Valley. Not that you can never get enough of a good thing in life. I almost feels like it trendy food now. But one that am hopefully places like Poke Express that puts out true local 808 poke sticks. Poke Express is the second location in the Valley. The first one location is part of Island Sushi & Grill one of my go to spots for local food.  I always check out the poke selection but never have room by the time done. I was excited hearing about second location one that they have place all too themselves. 

I stopped by for some recovery lunch. The set up was nothing like I thought was going too be. I kind of thinking that it would still be restaurant that has tables can sit down have your poke bowl. In hindsight once really thought about it. It like going to any fish market back in 808 have rows of different style Poke not just the style but the protein from salmon, ahi, tako, mussels, and more...It like buy it by the pound weight it out and next thing know out the door. Really the same concept here at Poke Express. They do have Poke Bowl that comes with choice of white or brown rice. The one scoop or two scoops action. Always recommend adding the fukikake when ask if want on top the rice. Just shredded seaweed with toasted sesame seeds and more seasonings. It adds another flavor. The Poke so many solid choices hard to pick only two. I went with the Spicy Ahi Poke Masago & Mayo and Ahi Limu Poke. They were both awesome!!! The Spicy Poke had the perfect balance with the Mayo and the Masago rounded out the texture on point. The Ahi with Limu. The Limu tasted nice and fresh could have had bowl of Limu. Hell yay! One thing I like about the way they present it since it take out not all in bowl. Both style poke are in separate compartments so neither one touching each other. It makes you appreciate quality and freshness of the Poke looking at your box. 

Not only do they sell Poke but all the local style goodies. All the name brands associate with the 808. Only the best Aloha shoyu. The candy and cookies action. They even have whole freezer section with Zippy frozen chill action (if your from the 808 no need explain Zippy(, manapua, lau lau, portuguese sausage, mochi ice cream, and the works. They also have all the cold Hawaiian Sun drinks can choose from plus more. They talk about Vegas the ninth island but Poke Express one of few spots that soon as you walk in screams it!

The workers are all awesome. I thought they were friendly explained everything since it was my first time clearly, friendly, and with smile. The only thing is no place can sit down eat your poke bowl action. It well worth the stop or hell if want half pound or pound of some best poke in Vegas. One more reason huge fan of Poke Express is all they sell is really poke. Not trying do the sushi burrito but just POKE. They do right!! Five stars on point!!"}
{"text":"Salmon poke all day. Seriously one of the best things ive ever eaten. Good prices too. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"NOW THIS IS POKE!

Poke Express is the \"good stuff\" that I have been looking for. No more of those dime a dozen,  \"chipotle style\" poke bowl places for me-- my tastebuds are now spoiled by the yumminess that Poke Express brings to the over saturated poke world. 

My go to order is the spicy furikake ahi. The fish is fresh and the taste is spot on. They have a variety of poke in the counter to please everyone's cravings. I usually buy a scoop of rice on the side and they top it with furikake. Ono! 

Customer service has always been spectacular. They always offer a sample if you are not sure what to order.

No tables. No frills. Just grab and go. 
So happy to have Poke Express close by for all my poke cravings!"}
{"text":"Awesome Hawaiian style poke! Their To-Go counter  is a must-visit every time I'm in town. All poke variations are excellent, and the kimchee rocks too. Friendly service helps round it up to a solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good poke
Tasted like the ones on the island
Liked ahi shoyu and limu
Salmon poke good too
Wasn't crazy about tako though
Definitely worth the trip"}
{"text":"What can I really say that hasn't been said, great quality of seafood period. The guys behind the counter are friendly and definitely recognize you after only a couple visits.  The staff has that Hawaiian vibe which shows in the food they produce.  the Poké is very dependable.  They really have their recipes down and stick to them. also don't be afraid to ask for a free sample even something that sounds not good you might like it. The ocean salad and kimchi cucumber are must-haves to go with your Seafood. 
Bon appetit."}
{"text":"This place is freakin awesome!!  i love the Tako poke and salmon poke.  If you really want an item, especially salmon poke, be sure to call ahead around 1030 to reserve the amount you want since they always sell out..  I have been eating here about once every other week and have always had the same quality food.  The workers are super cool.  It can get busy so if you call in your order you can avoid the line and go straight to the register.  Even if you don't call ahead the wait is never more than 10 minutes for service. Fish quality is excellent and prices seem very reasonable especially compared to going to a sushi place."}
{"text":"I've been numerous times with no questions about product freshness or quality.  I love the kim chee shrimp, spicy ahi and wasabi tako.  I've tried other items that were great as well.  The staff has always been extremely friendly and more than willing to provide samples and make their offerings to order (I like the spicy ahi with Da Bomb habenero sauce)."}
{"text":"Wow. Everything I tried was really good. It was weird because this place is inside island sushi. Other than that everything was really good. My group and I sampled a lot of the items and the person helping us didn't seem to mind. It was really simple with a person behind the counter and all of the pokes in the display. The person helping us was very nice and patient with us. I ended up getting the spicy ahi poke with masago and mayo. I definitely recommend coming here or at least trying."}
{"text":"First time trying Poke Express & it wasn't a disappointment. This particular spot is located by Craig's Ranch in North town which they have two now by the way being the second one located in Henderson. 

Thought at first it was a dine-in restaurant but more like a Hawaiian store with assortments of fresh Salmon, Ahi Tuna, Seaweed etc with all the sorts of sauces & combinations on whatever your tastebuds desire. Didn't really look around the whole store on what else they were offering @ the menu as I got so mesmerized what was behind the display fridge. 

Real friendly bradah behind the counter made me sample a few to the point of me the one getting embarrassed coz he was giving me a couple of fish cubes a taste which would've filled me up if i tried everything. Should've known that & brought my own bowl of rice, try all of them then burped politely & said mahalo & walked out, lol! Just kidding...Whoa dis guy! 

But anyways, place is a must try with competitive pricing, fresh, great tasting Poke, a bunch of Hawaiian treats & cool folks makes this a truly \"Ninth Island\" stop shop."}
{"text":"Set up in the fashion of a butcher shop, this place has to-go poke & other Hawaiian items available for take out from their cold deli case. The family that runs this place are the most charming, friendly people! They are quick to serve, & encourage you to taste samples. This is far & away the most authentic poke in town. I stop in when I crave high quality, affordable Hawaiian poke. Try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If their was a no star I'd give poke express a zero star. We use to be regulars but today is the last time I come here. Due to walking into the store we were ask to leave because the manager said it was closed. If a restaurants light should be turned off and the doors should be locked and maybe I'd be more lenient. But it irritates me how their was still poke left and being regular customers they couldn't just take our order, I mean like we entered the door on time and then we were embarrassed and kicked out. So never again will I come here due to the customer service. This is a small business, who knows this place might be closed down for the loss of customers."}
{"text":"If you LU-LU-LUVVVVVV Pokè then skip the poke burrito bowl places and go to Pokè Express! 

Okay, don't get me wrong, but sometimes I don't want all that fancy stuff that comes with a pokè bowl. I just want the rice and lots of pokè. #dontjudgeme

Maybe that's just the island girl in me...

You can choose your poke of choice and there is quite a few choices. They have shoyu, garlic, sweet chili, wasabi and oyster sauce to name a few Pokè. But they also had Tako Pokè (octopus) and some seafood Pokè style choices. I always get the Shoyu Pokè and then I'll pick one other to try which I mix up every time I go there. This is probably the most authentic Pokè you can get that taste like how they make them in Hawaii.

The fish tastes as fresh as you're gonna get being that we live in the desert.

Not only do they have Pokè but other Hawaiian  treats that you could pick up and won't find in your local super markets.

And lastly, you must try the soft serve ice cream. I have never had this kind of ice cream before. They have two flavors Strawberry and Blue vanilla. The taste and flavors are unique. I would say a bit fizzy, a cross between shaved ice and ice cream. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! They do have them in pre-made ice cream cups with other flavors. I can't really comment on those flavors BUT the strawberry and blue vanilla are so de-licious! I can't leave without having one. 

Definitely give these locals a try because they do not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Poke Express makes some of the best poke around the valley. If you haven't been you should. They're the same PE that use to be in Island Sushi and they still have their location up north.

When it comes to poke PE don't mess around. They make all the good stuff ahi, spicy ahi, shoyu, kim chi, mussel, clam, tako, and so on. I'm seriously getting hungry. The quality and taste are always excellent. 

Inside it's small with no tables or seats. You pretty much have to take it to go. Devour it in your car or right there while standing. They also have various frozen and non-frozen goodies from Hawaii. Portuguese sausages, Zippy's chili, kalua pig, Aloha Shoyu, rice, Jade snacks, all the essentials of a Hawaii local family household.

Customer service was up there. Wouldn't know if being from Hawaii made a difference but it was quick, friendly, welcoming. One of the people there mentioned that they might be trying to get a location on the westside, that would be awesome. 

And if you didn't already know, with the flood of \"poke\" spots opening up around the valley there really are only a few businesses that specializes in making poke like back in Hawaii. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with these new \"poke\" spots though you'd probably not find me in one to often. 

Of course they make poke bowls but they're different from what you might be expecting. I'd eat these poke bowls."}
{"text":"Always get the salmon, with onions, sauce inside - perfection. Furikake ahi? - so good. That garlicky beef jerky pipikaula? OMG. Garlic chicken with noodle combo? YUM.. my only recommendation to the business owners would be to bring in good Kona coffee - your coffee program here is uncharacteristically weak as a restaurant that serves breakfast. 

But I still love you and please, take all my money.."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Vegas...wanted some poke...someone suggested we come here. Very tasty! We got the kim chee tako poke, ahi limu & spicy ahi poke. Went perfect with the chicken katsu I made for our dinner. We will be going back again definitely sometime this week."}
{"text":"Stop the presses.
This place is way, WAY out of your way but it alone is worth renting a car  in Vegas.  THE freshest fish, a variety of flavors abound.  We gorged ourselves on several but the simpler the preparation, the more we enjoyed it.  Just a little hole in the wall deli-style grab-and-go place with a unique specialization.  But we will always return any time we are in Vegas, to continue to worship at this shrine to the wonder of  Poke."}
{"text":"This place is a great find for anyone that enjoys the magic that is poke.

Its a fresh poke deli counter.  They also sell drinks and other Hawaiian style packaged favorites. 

Go in and pick what you want.  If its not already prepared they are more than willing to make it for you.

The crab salad is delicious as is the spicy combo.  Really you can't go wrong with what you choose.  The salmon is delightful as well.

They were very helpful the first time I went in.  There is no place to eat your goods.  Pick it up and take it home.  

Don't go in if you don't like poke.  That would be dumb.  I just wish they would stay open past 6 pm."}
{"text":"The poke was so fresh! Reminded me of home! I drove 30 mins from summerlin for this! I am so glad I did. I got the ahi shoyu poke, Kim chi tako poke, Kim chi muscles, and Taegu....I would say that this poke was better than some place in Hawaii! 

To the owners: please open one in southern Vegas!!! I would be there all the time! 

Love love love!"}
{"text":"I just got back from Hawaii & I was craving poke & garlic chicken. While waiting for my bf's eye surgery to finish, I yelped for any restaurant that served poke & voila found this place. I agree that it's a hard place to find especially if you're not from Henderson. 

Walked in to order 2 bento boxes to-go... then I saw the Poke Express counter (OMG!!). Ordered shoyu ahi poke & of course my favorite tako poke with limu. True, it's not the same as getting fresh poke like back home in Hawaii but it's still sooo \"ono.\" 

The bento boxes remind me of Fatboy's but this place serves fried noodles in them so that's a plus in my book.  

Dare I say this, but their malasadas tastes way better than Leonard's. 

Can you serve li hing malasadas too though? Or anything with li hing? 

Oh & 1 star's deducted b/c this place is located in Henderson only (drove 40 minutes to get here)."}
{"text":"Ordered some various poke and was disappointed that the amount they give you is less than the actual amount because of all the sauce that's in the container. I ordered Spicy Tuna Poke, Wasabi Poke, Kim Chee Cucumber, and Top Shell Poke. I loved all except the Wasabi Poke as there was way too much Soy Sauce that was marinaded in. My favorite was the Spicy Poke. They don't do Poke Bowls so you have to get rice next door if you want to have a Poke Bowl. It's kind of out of the way from the strip but I wanted Poke for dinner and the place near the strip closes early. Good option for later evening poke."}
{"text":"Was spending a weekend in LV and was amazed by the variety of Hawaiian food options.  Based on the Yelp reviews, I decided to try Poke Express and was glad that I made the drive to the store.

Craig Road is a little big of a drive from the Strip, but good food is always worth the extra drive.  I tried a selection of different pokes including the ahi limu, kimchee mussel and the raw tako (octopus) kimchee.  The ahi and mussel are standard poke options, but the raw tako was a unique experience.  A little bit more slippery than squid, and I felt like the guy on \"Bizarre Foods\".  But if you like sea urchin or salmon eggs, this is a good choice for the unique texture.

The service is top notch.  They're willing to give you free samples and when they found out that I was staying at a hotel, they gave me some additional bags of ice to keep the fish cold until I got back to the room.  I'm definitely up for another trip to Poke Express on my next trip to Sin City."}
{"text":"I grew up in Hawaii until I moved to Southern California about 6 months ago.  My sister moved to Vegas in 2006 and after I decided to move to California, my parents moved to Vegas to be near all of us.

So after not eating poke for about 4 months, I figured I could find some decent local food in Vegas.  We heard about Poke Express while still living in Hawaii.  Owner is my mom's coworkers brother or something.  

I'd been wanting an ahi poke bowl for months.  So when visiting my family one weekend, my mom and I stopped here the night before I drove back to California   I picked up a pound of shoyu ahi poke for California and my mom got some ahi poke and tako poke.  

My first thought walking in was, \"I'm back in Hawaii!\" I felt at home.  Workers spoke pidgin and so did most of the customers.  

Ahi poke was delicious.  Fresh and decently priced, considering you're in Vegas and far from the ocean.  Friendly staff and variety of poke to choose from.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I decided to try it after reading the raving reviews and I am so glad I did!!  I can't believe how good everything tasted...I mean, this is seafood in the desert! This is definitely going to be my regular go-to place :). To top it all, the staff was so friendly and helpful...made me feel like I was in Hawaii."}
{"text":"I'm from California and we do not have Poke like this anywhere. NorCal, SoCal, NO. My favorite here is the Ahi Furikake"}
{"text":"Have to say I'm pretty disappointed, at first I was extremely happy with this place on my first visit. The guy (don't know his name) was super nice upon entering, about 20 min before closing.

He offered me a couple samples, was super pleasant and informative on both the menu and some of their products that originated in Hawaii. I got their spicy poke with avocado and cucumber with a side of rice with furikake.
And even offered me a side of eel sauce as a suggestion to try with it.

And it was cheap too! Only about 10 bucks.
So i came back around the same time 2 days later and ordered the same item. When I went in, this time I was greeted by the female worker, she was a little less happier to be there and looked tired or like she wanted to get out of there.

So I brushed it off and ordered. I asked first if I could try a sample but she said I had to come earlier to try. Which was strange because last time I came at the exact same time? But it's whatever no big deal. So then I asked for a side of rice, but she said they're sold out... 

Um okayy, so then I just ordered the poke. She wasn't very talkative, just rang me up then said okay. Customer service was lacking a lot this time..
So anyways I ended up just going next door to teriyaki madness to get a bowl and side of rice since they were out at poke express. And when I opened up my poke, she gave me the wrong poke.. 

It's really Sad because I wanted to like this place a lot. But as of now, I just don't think it's worth the drive considering my last experience was pretty bad. Also it's upsetting that I drove all the way here with a friend from summerlin area talking about how good they were just to realize I was mistaken. It was pretty embarrassing and I feel as a business they should they be too.

I was considering making this my new Poke stop instead of to see, but I have to reconsider that now. Sorry but so far until I see a change, it's a 1 star for me.. Its sad that one employee can change your entire input of an establishment."}
{"text":"Kimchee Poke - rubbery
Spicy Poke - good
Tako - ok

Great idea, but perhaps I was there on a slow day with not so fresh freshness."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I came in at 3.22 pm on Friday afternoon. All they have left is ahi poke. No salmon. No Hamachi. Only ahi. What a joke. While I appreciate poke by the pound, it's meaningless if you have nothing in stock besides ahi tuna. I drove quite a bit of distance all for naught. Highly disappointed. Will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"This is the first place that I had poke. I am a big fan of sushi, and this place was wonderful. They had the options that I was looking for, the option of salmon with soy and spices or just regular, potato salad, and furakake. Gave us rice courtesy of coming as well. Had the option too of Ahi tuna and imitation crab. Though personally I prefer salmon. Would recommend to all people that have a taste in raw fish."}
{"text":"The fam loves Poke Express.  We stop in and get our fill of Hawaiian Poke and custom made Edamame every time we are in Vegas.  The poke selection reminds me of being in Hawaii.  Love their selection and they are so friendly.  The place gets pretty busy around lunchtime so plan accordingly if you want to avoid the lunch crowd.  See you again soon Poke Express."}
{"text":"Every since our family vacay to Maui in March, I have been looking high and low for Hawaiian Poke.  Not the kind you buy at a sushi place where they barely give you any and then overcharge you for it, but the kind you get at Foodland on Maui...deli style!  Who knew that my search would end when da hubby and I were vacationing in Las Vegas!

We stopped in last Sunday and to our surprise Poke Express is NOT a restaurant but a small deli that also sells food items from the islands.  The couple running the place were so very friendly and let da hubby and I try poke after poke after poke!  We ended up purchasing 3 kinds of poke, and ate it on a bench outside the BigLots store in the same strip mall.  LOL  We were so full and happy.  I just wish I could wrap up Poke Express and move it closer to where we live.  Next time we are in Vegas, it will definately be one of our stops."}
{"text":"They have pipikaula!!!
We went in to get some pupu's for the New Year's Eve Party we were attending.  Oh my gosh....poke heaven!!!!
We ended up with:
Spicy tuna - awesome to make handrolls
Spicy combo - spicy tuna with avocado, cucumber, and crabmeat - DELISH!
Furikake Ahi - mmmmm.  On the sweeter side, but oh so yummy!
Spicy Cucumber kimchee - just like mom makes it!
Pipikaula - soft, with just the right amount of salt and spice
We will definitely be hitting this spot up every visit!!
The owners and workers are super nice, get plenty ALOHA spirit.

The only thing I wish they would have is a pot of fresh rice to be able to serve us some hot steaming bowls so we can eat the poke there on the spot!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It wasn't what I thought it would be, I was expecting a poke bowl place. In my opinion, it's so much better here. The fish is fresh and you can get it by the pound. The prices are reasonable. And what I liked the best is that since they don't do bowls I didn't have to have rice! Just fish! My favorite place. Also the staff is amazing. They are so nice!!! This is my new go to place!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to give poke bowl a try.  The salmon was good but the tuna was I think still a little frozen. Not coming back."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB.com!!! My favorite is the wasabi poke, spicy avocado, limo poke, and shoyu poke. I guess I like it all!  The sauces is very tasty and the counter crew is super friendly. My favorite day is POI day!!!!  One day out of the week they bring in fresh poi, but I'm not telling you when. ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after looking on Yelp for something different. I was pleasantly surprised at the wide selection of fresh authentic Poke. I like that I was able to sample before I bought. I finally chose the spicy avocado ahi. It was good, and mildly spicy. Not over spicy. I really enjoyed this as it was all I had for lunch that day. I know this doesn't look like the place to get amazing Poke(NLV), but you will be happy you did stop in."}
{"text":"I'm just happy there's one right by my gym now! I did the wasabi ahi and spicy masago and mayo ahi. Never disappoints! They also have various Hawaiian and Asian groceries too."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem in Vegas/Henderson! I've been here a few times and it never disappoints. All the staff are friendly, will explain what each flavor is and give you a sample."}
{"text":"tried the blue fin tuna to change it up from the usual poke and rice. yum, that tuna is like eating butter of the ocean, so silky smooth and tasty. Be careful, they only make a couple trays a day so it don't spoil."}
{"text":"I first tried the deliciousness of Poke Express back in January when I was in Vegas for work. Since then, I had been having mad cravings for their salmon poke. Flash forward to this past weekend when my partner and I decided to take an impromptu road trip to Las Vegas. We're both from Hawaii, so Las Vegas is really like the 9th island to us. We drove 4 1/2 hours from LA and headed straight to Poke Express (instead of hitting the slot machines)--best decision we ever made.

Coming around lunch time was perfect because they had everything in stock (I imagine they probably run out of their popular items a bit later in the day). We were able to try some of their specials of the day (marlin, yum yum!), but eventually we settled on some of our favorites: shoyu ahi poke, salmon poke, and shoyu furikake ahi poke.  The cuts of fish are fresh and good quality and their sauce is unrivaled. My favorite is the salmon poke--the buttery taste of the salmon complements their sauce well. 

Customer service there is always awesome--the owners are so friendly, it really makes me feel like I'm back home. 

If you're feeling homesick for other Hawaii goods, they do have a few shelves of some of the Hawaii staples: shoyu, S&S saimin, soda crackers, nori, Hawaiian sun juices, and even frozen malasadas! 

Just a note, this is not a proper restaurant, but more like a deli. There are no tables inside, but you can go to the plate lunch place in the same shopping center and cry your homesick for Hawaii tears in your food.  

TIP: If you plan on buying some poke for later (or to take home--which is what we did), you can ask for the sauce on the side for the salmon poke. It prevents the poke from getting too soft by the time you get around to eating it. The owner also suggested calling ahead if you plan on buying a large amount, so they can set it aside for you. You can bet I'll be doing this next time! 

*Check out my pictures for close ups of the shoyu ahi poke, salmon poke, and shoyu furikake ahi poke."}
{"text":"Found out one of my favorite places in town for Poke moved! Poke express isn't in island sushi anymore. It's over off of Stephanie in the same plaza as my friend's coffee shop Jozu coffee. Same amazing Poke as always, had the spicy avocado Poke, so good!!!"}
{"text":"Came here because of Nelson Q. and his wonderful UYEs.  Their poke is wonderfully good!  

I love both their traditional style pokes as well as some of their explorative variations.  I don't think you can go wrong here with what you order, but even better than that is the fact that you can taste anything before you buy it!...I'm told you need to come earlier do that consistently though since they run out of some of the prepared items.  If you need a place to start though, check out their   Ahi Shoyu, Spicy Ahi, Ahi Limu,and Limu Tako Poke.

Some have complained that they are a little expensive...I still think it's worth it though and don't know of any better poke around...so if it's poke you want Poke Express is a must.

They are a counter style small business without any seats.  Nelson brought us a few doors down to 808 Mixed Plate since they're owned by the same family and allow you to eat Poke Express items in their...plus 808 is tasty enough to check out while you're there as well."}
{"text":"The fact that there are three restaurants under one roof is genius.  This place does some awesome fresh poke.  The Island plate counter has loco moco and other hawaiian goodies, and to the right there is a sushi restaurant that was popping.  Soooo Many options!

I want it all and then some.  It was almost like a festive potluck once we brought all the food together on the table.  Speaking of which this would be awesome to pick up stuff to make a picnic :)

Why are there no good hawaiian places in LA?

I want the whole combo of roasted pork loco moco and fresh poke...Soo good...If yall are going, bring me back some ya here."}
{"text":"I always come to this specific location whenever I visit Vegas. My girlfriend and her family whom are all from Hawai'i say this is the closest to authentic poke from back home. And I agree because I ate poke in O'ahu, a lot of it. The quality of the poke reminds me exactly of what I had back in Hawai'i and makes me excited for my upcoming trip. I highly recommend this location specifically and will continue to come here!!

What we orders:
- Spicy Ahi Combo (Tuna & Crab)
- Spicy Avocado Ahi
- Salmon Poke w/ Special Sauce
- Regular Spicy Ahi
- Taegu"}
{"text":"Love the kimchi mussel.. Sorry its second best to the ones made in Maui but it serves it's purposes."}
{"text":"I think it's pretty magical how they're able to keep their fish so fresh here. In comparison to all the Poké joints I've had throughout Vegas, they definitely take the W for me. Simple rice bowls, simple Poké ingredients!"}
{"text":"Simply Awesome!! I have traveled to Oahu for many years and have always enjoyed true Poke. This place takes me back to exactly what I love about the island. 
Super Friendly Staff and Yes they are from Oahu! :)
The Poke selection is incredible so going to want to order more than one type of Poke. Lol I'm glad I stopped by on my way to Phoenix. This place is So worth it!!"}
{"text":"Best poke for the 9th island!  Service is just as good. One of the guys always remembers what I'm going to order."}
{"text":"I basically flew all the way from LA to LV to try this place because my friends who live in vegas raved about poke express...however they went to the other location. Anyway, I was craving poke and really wanted to try this one even though it's inside another store. You can sample the different options!

I wanted to order the spicy ahi with avocado but there was only a little bit left and wasn't sure if it was still fresh. I opted for the 1/3lb furikake ahi.  The ahi tuna itself is delicious - definitely some of the freshest I've had but I wished I sampled it first because it ended up being really salty and I didn't bother ordering rice. I'm not sure if it was worth the price ($15.95/lb) but at least I got to satisfy my poke craving. 

I wish they offered salmon!!"}
{"text":"I missed home ..I was ono for some raw fish so I went to poke express..kinda pricey but got my raw fish had some ono oyster ahi , some limu ahi and some dry aku wanted more but my bill was already fifty dollars and that was only for the fish but for Vegas you can't go wrong.."}
{"text":"Fell in love with Poke in Hawaii, tried to make it myself...ok but not great.  This place rocks for a Poke addiction, you can try several different kinds from Spicy Mayo to Wasabi Ginger to Garlic Avocado...all are fantastic! 

Only buy what you want to eat that day, maybe 1/2 or 1/4 pound-- I didn't like it the next day but that is just me and fish in general. 

Healthy and yummy - a favorite spot for a quick bite. No seating in or outside...so take your poke across the street to the park for a picnic!  

Mahalo!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to get poke!  We used to drive all the way to North town but now it right next to our gym! The poke is always fresh and the staff is always friendly.  I usually always get the same thing (ahi tuna/crab combo) but when I want to try something new the staff is always great with letting me try samples!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place just brings back the island boy in me. Recently moved out here to vegas and I live near Craig so this little spot makes me feel just at home. I love fish just as much as the next guy and this spot is awesome! 5 star rating for sure! Happy customer always, good staff & \"ONO PUPUS\" if you know what I mean. 
 
I recommend this place to all the local natives near the area & if you no live close to Craig it's worth the drive!!!! 

MAHALO \m/"}
{"text":"Is this a preview of the food in Hawaii? I can't believe how good the fish is here. Every time I come to Vegas and I visit Poke Express, I am totally blown away with what they have available. The prices are extremely reasonable and the staff are helpful. They don't have anywhere available to sit and eat there, so we usually end up eating in the car. If some of the items appear to have run out, if they have the fish available they will make it fresh for you. I don't know when they started to offer additional items, but they now have rice, as well as some other side dishes to compliment your Poke. The Poke they offer seems fairly simple, just a few quality ingredients, matched with fresh fish and seafood, that's all you need. Eating the Poke here makes me feel like I could actually make this at home. I know I could make it at home, but honestly I wouldn't be able to make anything as delicious.

If you visit Vegas, make the quick drive over to Poke Express. I don't know if there is Poke on the strip, if there is, it doesn't even come close to what is offered here. I would recommend this instead of most sushi that is offered on the strip also. You can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"Even if this place served the worst food, it would still do well because the owners/staff are too nice!  But it does serve fantastic poke.  It's my favorite thing about working in my North Las Vegas office on Wednesdays, it means I can go here.
My personal favorite is the one with avocado (yes I understand that you get less fish for the money if there is avocado mixed in... but you know what, I don't care!!"}
{"text":"No spots like this in LA.  Just thinking about this place Makes me want to drive to Vegas just to order some poke!!!  Definitely worth it to drop by and pick some up for the drive home, and their breakfast choices are pretty good too (Portuguese sausage and eggs mmmmm)!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for loco moco for such a great price.  All you need is the mini portion; trust me on that.  Bang for your bucks!"}
{"text":"As a girl growing up eatin this stuff it is hard to impress me. But with many hawaiian food places in the city of las vegas, I drove by here and tried it. I was craving poke at the time because ever since I moved here a couple weeks ago and I know it is available I always want it especially because it is a tasty, nutritious and healthy meal. 
Anwyays when we walked it I immediately could hear the pigeon accents from the people on the sitting at the tables. It felt just like at home! The atmosphere is super casual and kinda a little messy with little pieces of rice all over the place/on the floor/tables just like Zippys at home lol. 
You wouldnt know they served Poke unless you walk all the way to the back of the store and you see a small container filled with poke. So many kinds: Hawaiian style, Limu, Spicy Masago, Kim Chi poke, kim Chi crab, Cucumber kim chi, etc. My friends and I grabbed a pound of the Spicy masago, a pound of the Hawaiian style, 1/4lb Cucumber kim Chi, 1/2lb of the Kim Chi Poke. I was really looking forward to trying to the kimchi raw cab but it looked kind old and knarly. Disappointed by that but the poke was fairly good. Kinda expensive. I think it was around $18 per pound, so total we spent about 50+ bucks on poke. We also tried the malasadas and mochkio chicken as well as the garlic chicken.
I know the Garlic chicken was BOMB. Fried and hot and crispy with just the right amount of spicyness and loads of garlic flavor. The mochiko chicken which my friends had we slightly overcooked and dry. They said they dont recommend it. Also the malasads were pretty good. Served nice and hot, but it wasnt the best ive had as Ive eat it at the best places on Oahu. 
Overall great place, good atmosphere, pretty authentic and they are supposedly know for their poke bowls. Super casual place and pretty relaxing to eat. I know the restaurant on the adjacent side of the express side gets PACKED. 
Next time I try the Oxtail soup!
Ill be back!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I had my reservations about Poke Express as who would think that you could find good poke in the middle of the Las Vegas desert. In North Las Vegas of all places. But my dad did and because he was such a fan of Poke Express, I stopped in to try some in a way, to honor him. I'm glad I did - not just because my dad knew the owners there - but because they serve some really good freakin' poke. 

Anyway, the owners are uber nice and informative. I also appreciate, though I didn't really do it - how they offered up samples before I bought. Prices are in line with the cost of fish - and considering it has to be shipped in (remember the location) it's worth every penny. 

There's a great variety of different flavors of tako and ahi. There were a few other items I didn't take notice of but I'll bet they'll be good, if it's what you like. I went with my usual limu poke and spicy ahi. I got a half pound of each. I had intended on eating a little bit of each as a lunch snack, but it was so fresh and tasty, that I ended up eating the entire pound for lunch, in pretty much one sitting. 

Anyway, over on Craig Road just east of MLK, on the south side in a strip mall - in North Las Vegas ... there's a place that serves up poke similar to what you'll find in Hawaii. My family lives nearby so it'll just be one more reason to visit ..."}
{"text":"A unique find in North Las Vegas. I was amazed at the broad variety of poke and other seafood. All of it was extremely fresh and flavorful. I appreciated the knowledge of the server in helping me make the right choices. Also, you can sample anything so try before you buy. They were out of rice but as others have said, the teriyaki place nearby will hook you up."}
{"text":"I thought I've had good poke until I came to Poke Express! I am so happy that we had a chance to stop by to pick up a bunch of seafood goodness before driving back to LA. I had THE perfect experience here. We were greeted warmly and given delicious samples! 

I bought the following (in order of my fav): 
1) kimchi Tako
2) furikake spicy ahi
3) spicy mayo ahi 
4) shoyu Tako 
5) seaweed salad 

Got close to 4 pounds of nom noms on ice and a poke bento box to go! It is so difficult finding good octopus. Almost bought a pound each and had to control myself!"}
{"text":"Everytime I came to Vegas, I always have to drop by and pick up some poke. We always get the furikake ahi poke and the salmon with special sauce. We eat them with the Club crackers (bought it separately at walmart). It's so good but pricey. Almost $16 a lb. The salmon with special sauce is my favorite. When ordering to go, have them put the special sauce on the side. It can get salty if the salmon sits in the sauce for a period of time.  Make sure its their special sauce, not shoyu.

There are two locations. This one and one on Craig Rd.  Service is good at both location. Try to come early because they will run out of salmon quickly."}
{"text":"So delicious! Favorite poke in Vegas. Had the garlic ahi poke, so good! Very friendly service too. :)"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp!!!! This place is awesome. I can't wait to return to enjoy another bowl of delicious Ahi Poke. The portion size was great and my Ahi Poke rice bowl was the perfect lunch. My husband ordered the kalbi, which I thought was soo soo tasty. I wish the cuts of meat were a bit leaner, but we were eating beef short ribs, so what do I expect. The kalbi was accompanied by a mac salad, that I thought was better than the stuff I've eaten in HI. Not that I'm any sort of expert on mac salad, but it was damn good. Poke Express is connected to Island Sushi, but way way better than its neighbor. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My lovely daughter recommend I check this place out, trusting her good judgement when it comes to great food my boyfriend and I headed to Poke Express to pick up some lunch. I quickly made a mental note on how conveniently close it is to my home (4 1/2 min.), Darren Iha, the President, recognized  us correctly as a \"first timers\" and began suggesting delicious taste samples. We enjoyed his \"educational tour\" of the different flavors and preparation styles. He wanted to be sure we would be 100% happy with our choices. We left with plenty of refreshing Ocean Salad, seasoned, smoked Ahi Haleiwa, Wasabi Ahi Poke and Kim Chee Cucumbers, certain that we will return again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent poke! New to henderson and I'm so glad I found this place! I had the spicy tuna w avocado poke and the salmon - they were both fab! Perfectly seasoned, fresh fish, and friendly service. I went for a late lunch (around 2) and it was packed so I grabbed it to go and ate  jn my car because u couldn't wait to try this! Lol ! Finding a parking spot was difficult but worth it. Might be going back tomorrow. Didn't check the menu but this pole would be amazing with some crispy flat wontons... You HAVE to check this place out."}
{"text":"I have an insatiable appetite for raw fish and Poke Express satisfies it! Gosh have you seen their review average? People are crazy about them! Fast and friendly deli-style service, plus unlimited samples to try out everything before you buy - you can't lose here.

After tasting what feels to be like 20 different poke and seafood options, we narrowed it down to 5 and I noticed mayo was the trend. Next time, I would probably get a sweet chili or shoyu option to balance it out. 

Spicy Wasabi Ahi with Mayo-Masago ($14.95/ LB) - Flavor Rating:5/5
Apicy Ahi Combo: Crab, Avocado, Cucumbers ($14.95/ LB) - Flavor Rating:5/5
Spicy Ahi Poke with Mayo-Masago ($14.95/ LB) - Flavor Rating:4/5
Spicy Salmon with Mayo-Masago ($14.95/ LB) - Flavor Rating:3/5 (the salmon was slightly fishy)
Ocean Salad ($6.99/ LB) - Flavor Rating: 5/5

Out of everything we tasted, I really loved the Spicy Wasabi Ahi and also the Ocean Salad. The fish cubes are giant and plump with just the right amount of wasabi, not too much and not too little. The ocean salad has a refreshing sweetness and it pairs perfectly with any of the poke options. I really like what they are doing here and Vegas is so lucky to have them.

PRO TIP: they don't serve rice on Sundays so you might want to B.Y.O.R. or pick up an order of rice a few doors down at Teriyaki Madness."}
{"text":"I met one of the managers while on the job and he told me that he works at Poke Express and i said... whats that?

and he said music to my ears... AHI POKE and island food.

i visited the next day and he remembered me and said \"oh hey! you came like you said!\"

POKE IS MY FAVORITE FOOD, and this placed nailed it.

This place is inside of Island sushi so poke express is separate from them but also is conjoined when ordering as well.

ALOHAAAA"}
{"text":"The best place for fresh authentic Poke. This Howly loves to go there, not just for the food but the people are the best! 
More than a week ago I had a small issue where a plastic cup leaked, obviously not their mistake. But they stood by it and said come back the next day. Life got busy and I didn't come back till now.(almost 2 weeks later). Not only did they remember and stand by their offer, they were so nice and apologetic about it. This is why I pray for their continued success! Honesty and great customer service like this is rare. 
Don't know about \"Poke\"? Go in and visit. Ask for a sample or as many samples as you need to make up your mind. Ask questions and get honest respectful answers without feeling like you're being talked down to. 
Love this place! Obvious Christian atmosphere.
They even have authentic Hawaiian groceries! 
And Ice Cream !!!!! Love Poke Express!!"}
{"text":"My favorite poke spot! Where it reminds me of home (Hawaii) awesome staff and by far the most awesome poke!!! Oyster sauce salmon poke rocks!!!"}
{"text":"I drive all the way from henderson to here for their amazing poke and fantastic, personalized service. It's like shooting the shit with ur uncle! Love it!"}
{"text":"My bf brought home 4 choices of poke for lunch. We had the the spicy combo poke, wasabi ahi, salmon poke, & spicy salmon. Both spicy have a mayonnaise dressing over them, kinda like the dressing you taste over rolls from sushi joints. The spicy combo is ahi with crab. Salmon poke taste like reg salmon sashimi. And last bust not least wasabi ahi was just the right amount of spice and juicy. All of them were juicy and nicely sliced chunks of fish. He was telling me that at Poke Express you're able to try before you order and there's a a bunchhh more too choose from like a ton of ice cream flavors but a ton of fish flavors! They price by pound. So we got half a pound of each of the 4 totaling to about 40$. It's fresh fish so 40$ not that bad. We couldn't even finish all of it! Amongst the two of us, half a pound each in all good for us. Can't wait to try what other pokes they have!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting a little over a year to get some Poke, pronounced with an oak-keh, (I sound like Humpty from Digital Underground in my head as I write this, for y'all's FYI) and man oh man oh man oh man was I not disappointed!!!! And neither was my wife. The last time we ate poke was two summers ago when we were in Hawaii on the island of Oahu and got lost taking the bus looking for some place and stumbled upon this little place called Pa'ina Café. Well, much to our delight, the poke was outstanding here at Hawaiian Style Poke and to be honest, I felt like a Hawaiian native that's missing home and just got a taste of home.

The place itself is small, but you get fooled because where their signage is on the building on the outside, I was expecting a huge, sit down spot. Only, there wasn't anywhere to sit down. There was only a counter, two very helpful young men behind that just mentioned counter, and a couple empty stainless steel trays of the spicy ahi tuna poke, the one that comes in the mayo dressing, which just so happened to be the one we wanted. But have no fear my dear, they told us they'd go to the back and whip up some for us. Now, anytime you go to a joint and there's \"natives\" eating at establishment, you know it's legit. And when we walked in, some of the other customers had that \"Hawaiian\" accent some would call pidgin. And everyone was friendly too. Customers, employees, it was so chill in there.

We tried 4 different things: spicy ahi, smoked tako, smoked salmon and lomi lomi salmon. The thing with ordering things by the pound, rather, seeing the prices by the pound is that you let your mind play tricks on you and make you think that you are paying too much for yummy fishy goodness and instead of ordering it by the pound, you order it by the 1/2 pound or quarter pound. I wish I wouldn't have been such a tight ass because the only thing we got a half pound of was the spicy ahi but we shouldn't gotten five pounds of it, and at least another 3 of the lomi lomi salmon. : ) 

The spicy ahi was our favorite, but the only thing missing was rice, which they had ran out of, because I could have eaten rice with that dressing all day long! Really, I wanted a bowl, but for some reason, they only make bowls on Mondays and Tuesdays. Anybody know why? Please enlighten me! The smoked salmon was so ONO! It reminded me of the smoked salmon people put on bagels with cream cheese, and to tell you the truth, I'd probably try to do that too, just to say I did Hawaiian fusion bagels and lox!!!!! The smoked tako was okay too, nice and smoky flavored, like octopus beef jerky, but it was a little too rubbery for our taste.

Our second favorite was the lomi lomi salmon. It was nice and lemony, and reminded me of good ol' fashioned Mexican ceviche, and I was tempted to buy some more and find me some tortilla chips and salsa to eat it with. I can honestly say without a doubt, I'm gonna have to go back to this joint EACH AND EVERY SINGLE TIME WE GO TO LAS VEGAS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy. This place is worth the drive. Ahi was fresh and flavorful. This place does not have any sitting area."}
{"text":"I always  stop by here when in Vegas to get poke.  They sell by the lb.  They also have plate lunches and a sushi spot as well."}
{"text":"Best Spicy Ahi Poke in town!!! Friendly service and great poke...Life is great!"}
{"text":"We come here whenever we are in Vegas to get some good classic Poke! 
It's a little out of the strip but it's worth it if you like Poke! They have a good selection of local food and the poke selection is really good too! Prices are standard and the ahi limu poke is really good!"}
{"text":"This was worth the 8 hour drive. I felt Aloha spirit here @ Poke Express. and I could taste it in their Poke. The gentlemen made sure we had samples before making our decision and it was worth every penny. 

This is a must visit in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Soooo Ono!!!  Salmon with da secret sauce I think that's what it was called was bomb!! Costumer service was great and place was nice and clean definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The owner Darren is soo nice! The Aloha Spirit can be felt here the moment you walk thru the door. You are always greeted with a Howzit or Aloha along with a smile. This place is authentic and the owner is from Hawaii. They are so humble here. Aside from the Island, this is the closest you are going to get to getting onolicious poke! Prices is fair and so worth the money! Fish so fresh and can get other kine poke as well as different kind island kine food. They open only from 10-6 so make sure you come early because they run out quick! You can sample before buying. Gonna end this now so I can enjoy my broke DA mouth Ahi Poke!"}
{"text":"POKE!

My fiancee and I came here because we missed Hawaii and had to get our fix! We use yelp, and you guys were right! It was so good. We had the spicy salmon poke, spicy ahi, furikake ahi and combination poke. 

It ALL tasted great. The service there was super friendly and when we saw the spam masubi, we couldn't pass it up. If they have the spam musubi katsu I would recommend that. You really can't lose with anything there. It's ALL good. 

If you are a first time visitor, look for \"Island Sushi\" at this location because they share the space there. When you walk into Island Sushi, half of it is poke express and the other half is the Island Sushi restaurant. (just a heads up). 

Poke Express, if you are reading this, PLEASE OPEN UP A STORE IN CHICAGO!!! You will do excellent business there. Believe that!  We don't have a poke \"source\" there so you would have ALL of our business. = )"}
{"text":"I can't say I'm a poke expert but this poke experience was pretty amazing! Fair warning though that there is no where to sit and eat inside Poke Express. However, the guy working the counter told us to just walk a couple stores down to 808 Hawaiian (a restaurant) after we bought it and they would have rice (extra charge) and seating. He was actually quite helpful and gave us samples of different poke and told us a half pound is just about enough for 1 person if you're eating with rice.  

We ended up trying 4 different types of poke. The first was the fresh salmon with shoyu (aka soy). This has a very sweet flavor and the shoyu sauce is more of a thicker glaze than a regular soy sauce. It tasted very good but I'd recommend getting this with another poke as it could become too sweet eating just this one alone. The second poke was the wasabi tune poke. Very delicious and you can definitely taste the wasabi! My two favorites were the spicy tuna pokes. We actually tried a regular spicy poke and a hotter poke. I enjoyed both equally. The price was roughly $13.95 per lbs for the tuna and salmon pokes.

Tips: 
- Go early as they run out of fish throughout the day
- Get at least 2 kinds so you don't get sick of eating just one kind. 
- Go to 808 Hawaiian down the street to get rice and seating. 

Over all a 5/5 on the poke! Super fresh salmon and tuna! You guys have to try it!"}
{"text":"As far as poke goes, this is as good as it gets. They have so many options I didn't know where to start! I only wanted a light lunch so I grabbed some Kimchee poke and the ocean salad. The poke was so extremely fresh. I instantly regretting only buying 1/4 lbs because I seriously could have eating double that. The kimchee flavor was subtle, there was a nice kick of spice but not too overpowering. 
The ocean salad was nice and fresh. This is pretty much a seaweed salad and it was a nice accompaniment to the poke. Great fresh flavor. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other offerings. 
My only complaint is that I wish there were some tables to sit inside. My mouth was watering so much I could not wait to get home to start eating so I was chowing down in my car. A must try."}
{"text":"Always love the service I get here and how welcoming it is whenever I come by to pick up some poke. I love the spicy ahi, kim chee muscles or the one with avocados. It's my favorite place to go for some seafood with 808 mixed plate close by."}
{"text":"My go to poke place! I drive 25 min just to buy poke even if there are closer poke shops. Def taste like home & got a good selection.

Correction: I go to the Henderson location. But went to this location once & it's just as good & actually bigger"}
{"text":"Some of the best things come in small packages. Case in point. Just like the \"Hole In The Wall\" and \"Mom and Pop\" places, if you are not paying attention, you can drive right by this place. Ironically, this place is also family owned, so both clichés apply.

With that said, the 100+ 5 star review average is a definite eye catcher.  As soon as I saw that, I knew I had to check it out hoping I wouldn't get disappointed. Well I am happy to report that the 5 star average is legit.

As soon as you come in, you are greeted warmly. When you look around, they have all sorts of Hawaiian themed merchandise. They have drinks, hats, seasonings, and even poi.

As for the main products. Just stroll on over to the big glass case where they have all the good stuff. Tip: Come right when they open so you can sample all the products because as soon as the afternoon comes around, most of the good stuff cant be sampled any more.

I ended up sampling the Crab Combo. After that first bite, we knew were getting at least a pound of that stuff. It has imitation crab meat and vegetables mixed with some kind of spicy chipotle mayo sauce. A pound of it came up to about 8 bucks and some change. If you ask me, I think they put some kind of drug in it because I couldn't stop eating it! 

As for the different kinds of Ahi, we went with the Kim Chee Ahi, promising to come back to try the other mouth watering options just based off the pics alone. We got a pound of it which came out to about 14 and  some change.

So in closing, probably the only thing that might subtract a star would be their hours. They are open Mon thru Tues, Thurs thru Sat 10 am to 6 pm. Sun 10 am to 5 pm. CLOSED WEDNESDAYS! Remember, this is a market/store type of place so the hours are not as weird as it seems. Their food and service more than make up for a potential subtraction of one star. So a \"Mahalo\" seems fitting for these guys and an \"Aloha\" from me since its the end of the review."}
{"text":"So you want awesome Poke, but don't need to eat there?  Poke Express is the ticket!  NO Seating, it's more like a deli counter.  Lots of choices and awesome poke!  They also s LL other Hawaiian foods.  Between 10am and 2pm they offer a poke bowl with hot rice!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since it's relatively close to my house. Seems like poke places are popping up lately everywhere and some do it better than others. But I'm my opinion Poke Express is doing better than most of the competition.

Located in a shopping center near EOS and my favorite coffee joint Jozo, it's convenient to the freeway and easily accessible. New glitz and glam her here. A simple store it goes directly to the point of serving some of the freshest and best of poke around.

As soon as you walk in you see the poke display case, reminiscent of a meat or bakery display case. The store itself is tiny. No place to sit really so don't expect to have your food here. Small display rack for traditional island/Hawaiian treats while you wait as well as a shaved ice premade dessert case and cold and freezer case with beverages and even mochi.

There's a wide selection of poke. Everything from a vast selection of tuna to salmon and krab. This day I decided to go with poke a la carte and decide to go with salmon poke with their ponzu sauce and their tuna poke with garlic.

I loved the salmon and ponzu. They also offer a house sauce which from what I understood is on the sweeter side. The salmon was perfect. Very fresh, firm and cut into the perfect bite size pieces. None of that stingy tendon and muscle you'll find at the cheaper poke spots. Color was beautiful and the taste was epic. I gave that a firm 5/5.

Went ahead and did the tuna with garlic. I gave this a 5/5. Taste was fresh and tasty. Color of the tuna was a deep purple pink which is what you're poking for. 

They have a 2 scoop with rice special for lunch which was pretty popular but I went ahead and just got half a pound of each. 

Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Super clean and welcoming. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I always come here for Hawaiian style poke. Large selection and the fish is flown in fresh daily."}
{"text":"I have been here four times now. Each time, a different order.

1. Kimchee Crab - It tasted great. However, getting the meat is just a headache. I would not get this, unless you really plan to spend more time picking at your food and working for it.

2. Ahi Poke w/ Limu - This was not that great. I really think the after taste is disturbing and prefer anything else. Even raw with no soy sauce.

3. Ahi Poke w/ Wasabi - This is great! I love that I do not need anything on the side to just eat this with a nice bowl of rice. I prefer having brown rice though.

4. Salmon w/ Wasabi - A MUST TRY! This is something you may ask them to make. They are glad to make it, and you will be glad you tried it!"}
{"text":"Good food I just wish the workers were more loud when asking my order. The guy asked if I wanted seasoning on my rice and I did not fully understood him the third time he said it."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem not only in Henderson but within the actual building itself since all you can see on the outside is the signage for \"Island Sushi\" and there is a door to the right and a door to the left which has a screen on it which gives the appearance that they are perpetually closed.  Choose door on the left and from here, you will first see a counter up front with desserts and a menu above you. To access Poke Express, you must go further down the hall where there is a counter with various poke priced around 10 dollars/lb and one has the option for sampling their bounty of poke in a variety of flavors.  Whoever came up with the term \"food porn\" probably envisioned poke as its monthly centerfold.  I mean seriously, it's pretty much glistening flesh that is scantily \"dressed\" with options including but not limited to wasabi, spicy mayo, limu (hawaiian seaweed), and shoyu (soy sauce)...quite a thing of beauty I must say.   

Since I biked as a marshall for the Rock and Roll Marathon, I was feeling particularly hungry and needed a carbo-boost post-ride, so I went with one of their Poke bowls, which has a substantial bed of sushi rice underneath the poke, but unless you're one of those folks from an Asian background where your parents threatened that if you didn't clean your rice bowl since the residual pieces of rice would pretty much resemble the pock-marked face of your future spouse, feel free to leave some of that rice behind.  Options for Poke rice bowl include the regular, with avocado (add 1 dollar), and DO NOT confuse the spicy ahi tuna bowl as poke....it is pretty much mushed up tuna mixed with spicy mayo that would likely get a 5 star yelp review if yelp existed for cats rating their food.  

I went with the regular Poke bowl and requested they add some chili sauce (the one with the green cap and rooster on the bottle, much more intense than Sriacha), since I was concerned the spicy mayo would overpower the natural flavors of the poke.  The bowl is served along with fresh sliced cucumbers, some marinated onions, and a few fried taro chips.   The poke had a very pleasing texture (chewy but not gummy), not overly seasoned, and tasted very fresh (may not be as good right off the island since the tuna was obviously frozen en route to Vegas).   My advice would be to stop poking your friends on facebook with flying sheep or watching that episode of Pokemon which induced epileptic seizures in young Japanese kids, go poke the person sitting beside you and come down here for some high quality poke.

One final note: for Spam Musubi fans, theirs is loaded with way too much rice much like their Poke bowls."}
{"text":"I'm not going to pretend I am an Ahi Poke expert. I'm not going to claim I know what Poke is suppose to taste like. But I will say this-- BEST POKE I HAVE EVER HAD thus far. 

I've been wanting to try this place out for years but for some reason Poke Express always loses the argument when it comes to other places to eat. Today I wanted something small & not a big meal so I opt for poke! 

Definitely not what I had imagined. It's a very small store. You can't sit anywhere to eat, not a restaurant. You just tell them what you like and you gotta get outta there. The Pokes weren't out because we came around 4 & they make it to order at this time of the day. If you come when they open, 10am, all the Pokes will be out so you can actually try them all out before you decide which one you want. The staff were very helpful to us first timers. 

I decided on the Spicy Ahi & the crab combo. & they were sooooooo good! The crab combo had a good kick to it. The ahi wasn't spicy at all but nonetheless still really good! Only bad thing about it was, I didn't order more! Next time I want to try the Kim Chi Ahi & the wasabi ahi! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of growing up in Hawaii. My better half is in heaven when we come here. Prices are great for the value."}
{"text":"Came in to end our weekend getaway with a late Sunday lunch before we hit the road back home from vegas. The previous Yelpers were right - this place is kind of hard to find, we accidentally passed it and went into the adjacent shopping center, but when we looked closer, just under the \"Island Sushi\" sign was the sign for \"Poke Express.\"

I think everyone but me got some sort of ahi dish, from the ahi bowl to the salmon ahi poke, which was all great. I enjoyed their 2 combo bento box lunch special plate: teriyaki chicken, tempura shrimp, salad, miso soup, 2 cali rolls, and an iced tea = REHAB.

Pretty good food, decent price, inconspicuous location. Good meal to balance everything out and hold you over on your drive back to reality from Sin City.

-civilities."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favorite place to get Poke. So fresh, so tasty... They're very friendly here, would suggest this place to anyone who wants some great Poke."}
{"text":"Good poke but the ratio to price is a bit steep!

I tried the combo spicy ahi which had avocados, imitation crab and other garnishes combined with the ahi and spicy mayo. The flavor was very fresh and it was quite enjoyable. The portions were not very big which I guess is what happens when eating poke in the desert. I only ordered a 1/2 pound which was a great side to the rest of the food I ordered but I will definitely get a whole pound next time!

The ambiance is very casual and the service for the POKE BAR specifically was excellent. The guy behind the counter even allowed toothpick taste tests.

Glad to know there's a poke spot such as this in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Poke Express shares the same space as Island Sushi & Grill. If you are sitting on the Island Sushi side and order hot food, it will come from the Poke Express kitchen. Only cold food comes from the Island Sushi side.
I sat on the Poke Express side and ordered a poke bowl. It was huge and so glad I shared with my sister. The salmon poke was very fresh and tasty! I recommend their bowls. We also ordered the spam musubi. My only complaint, there was too much rice! Otherwise, it was good. I was totally carbed out after the meal. 

If you decide not to dine in, you can order to go. You can also order different types of poke which are weighed and priced per pound. See my uploaded pics to the business.

This place is convenient for me to visit when staying at South Point or when visiting the 24 Hour Fitness nearby."}
{"text":"Best place to get a real \"poke bowl\". There's no seats inside, it's all to go. You can order poke by the fraction of a pound or more. I like to get the 2 selection of Poke and rice combo.

I like to get the spicy mayo Poke and Limu Poke. Bomb af.

Great value because it's the best place to get some poke and they offer rice covered with furikake."}
{"text":"Not even a week after I moved to Vegas, I was already searching for somewhere to get my fish from! Soooo glad I found this place! Everything was so good, the guy who worked there was super cool. Giving us tips where we can find rice and other stuff. They also sell stuff from home that you can't really find here, gallon aloha shoyu, mochiko flour, the good kine Mochi crunch. Making this place a ritual for sure!"}
{"text":"How on earth did I not know about this place?!? The worst part its right by my grandparents house so I really have no excuse for never seeing it...and I'm so sorry for prejudging the place because its in North Las Vegas. I shall never do that again :-(
Well lets get on to the good stufff....

I came here on a Sunday morning because I just happen to stumble upon it on yelp. The selection of poke is wonderful :-D The owner was wonderful! He let me sample some things like the spicy poke and smoke marlin which I ended buying cause it was delish :-) I also got the hawaiian style poke tuna which had a wonderful flavor and really fresh. They have a small selection of other Hawaiian items. I ended up purchasing a mixed 6pk of fruit drinks and some mochiko so I can continue my Hawaiian theme and make some baked jello mochi ;-) I also took the spicy poke and made that into sushi :-) perfect easy filling! 

These nice folks will be seeing more of me :-) I also noticed a sign saying they just opened a store in the Plaza I believe but this location is where I will be getting my fix ;-)"}
{"text":"After three different attempts to sample their poke, I was getting frustrated with Poke Express.  Unfortunately, they close early during the week which makes worker-bees buzzy. 

To my surprise, it was actually open on a Saturday night for my sampling delight! Favs were the wasabi tako and kimchee tako, though everything was superbly fresh and tasty. Only reason for 4 stars: their hours."}
{"text":"We buy our home Poke here weekly.  Notably the avacado poke, crab and tuna poke, the wasabi poke and the poke taco(octopus) are the ones we always get.  Everything is fresh and has that Hawaiian taste.  This is because the owners get their fish shipped overnight from Hawaii.  I know because we actually talked with the owner and cut a deal to order a number of whole fish a few times that were shipped with his stores order at an amazing price too!  It doesn't get more Authentic or fresh than that."}
{"text":"Poke express offer a huge selection of island style Poke for a great price. The store is very clean and well run, while the food is fantastic"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times.  I originally found it by looking at the reviews for Island Sushi.  They don't have a big sign for the express side.  It's just a turtle on the door.  

the first time I went here I went a little late no knowing that they closed this side a little early.  I went to the \"poke deli counter,\" at least that's what I have dubbed it.  The older guy working the station was very helpful.  There is so much to choose from and he made a great recommendation.  

Let's fast forward to my most recent visit. I showed up at noon and just ordered from the front counter.  There was a short line.  The place wasn't packed but there were a few people sitting down.  I wanted Poke so I ordered the Ahi Poke bowl.  Which I guessed was tuna and rice.  It was kind of on the expensive side.  I paid $9.50 as this was the market price at the time.  When I got the bowl it was pretty heavy.   And it was a good thing because I was hungry!  Now if you ever come here you have to order at least one malasada.  I had no idea what this incredible Hawaiian pastry was until last summer. One of my coworkers brought some from this place.  I like the custard filled ones.  

So if you are ever in the mood for some raw tuna and in a rush, Poke express is your place!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Love love love Poke Express! It's so good! I've never had any complaints and I go quite often. I even get other friends and family to try if they've never had poke before. They love it as well! My favorite is the spicy ahi tuna but love all their kimchee pokes too. Mussel and tako are my favorites. Fish has always been fresh!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, very helpful with recommendation and hand out free samples. I will back fir a quick lunck to go and sushi plater!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding.  The fish is fresh, and the service  is outstanding. My favorite  is the  Wasabi  Ahi."}
{"text":"Had the spicy ahi poke, ahi w/limu and the mix crab.... All very good! Was just too bad I didn't have a place to eat this yumminess right away as there's no dining room.....but I'll be back like schwartznegger!"}
{"text":"I just have to write this review after lunch, in my class! 
I love finding these hole in the wall places with really good food amid all the chain restaurants.  I tried 3 kinds of poke: spicy ahi poke, spicy avocado poke & furikake poke. All were really good... The tuna is very flavorful and does not have that fishy taste and gummy texture. Flavors are well balanced and service is good. The guy behind the poke counter made me try almost everything. I also tried their garlic chicken which was also very good and served in a bento box with rice and noodles. very good price and you have to come early during the day because once the poke is gone, that's it! will definitely come back here when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Great spot i bring all my co workers here. Quick grind fo lunch. For best results get a cold pack and grind"}
{"text":"I love the kim chee mussel poke it's spicyness is perfect and it's only 7.99 a pound what a great deal for something so onolocious"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and I love it.  Perfect when it's hot outside.   The salmon poke with special sauce is my favorite and I also like the muscle with kimchee."}
{"text":"What's there to say that everyone else hasn't? 
...Like, nothing. 

So here are a few tips:
1. No inside dining. Carry out only.
2. You can have samples! Sooooo good. None of the seafood has a fishy aftertaste to it either. 
3. Get you a drink here. Pass-O-Guava for the win.
4. No rice here, so walk to the Teriyaki place a few doors down and pick up a container of rice.

Stuff your face and pretend like you're back in the 808."}
{"text":"Oh yes, POKE!!!!!!!  Real Hawaiian POKE!!  

I bookmarked this place for months and finally went last year as it was a little out of the way.  Lots of variety of poke and they even had salmon poke!  (not many place do salmon besides lomi lomi).  

Well I just moved and I'm way closer to Poke Express and I've gone twice in the last 2 weeks already!  hehe

I've been going close to closing time so I'm not sure if it's different during the day - but they make all my ahi poke fresh from scratch.  I love that since I know it wasn't sitting out all day and getting dried out.  

They also have freezers filled with mochi ice cream, icees, frozen salmon parts, and other \"Hawaiian\" staple foods like noodles, buns and even pasteles.  They also have dried goods available for sale.

I met one of the owners the other day and he was really cool to chat with.  I miss local people (I lived on O'ahu for the last 8 years) so it was nice.  The other guys running the store have all been really cool and nice as well.  

This is definitely a must try for anyone wanting some poke on the mainland."}
{"text":"I am glad I took the time to read the review on YELP.  This was the first time I had this type of food.  First the person who was assisting me was great.  He made recommendations and allowed me to sample the different selections.  Everything was so fresh and good it was hard to make a decision as to what to buy.  I purchased three dishes.  I will definitely go back soon.  He did recommend that I come around 10:00 am when they have even more selections to try.  This is really a hidden gem and it will become a favorite."}
{"text":"This place is a must try if you love seafood and are in the Henderson area! It's truly a little hidden gem tucked away in the plaza. Their fish is so fresh and they let you sample anything you want to try. They only do bowls from 10am-2pm and after that it's by the pound so keep that in mind if it's crucial for you to have some rice on hand. My personal favorite is the spicy ahi with masago and mayo (and I'm usually a salmon person). Overall, they have great prices, great tasting options, and quality service so what more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"Always friendly service but what else do you expected when they are from the Aloha State. Lunch time favorite of mine is the poke bowl. Available with one or two choices of seafood and 1 or 2 scoops of rice depending on how hungry you are. Also available in the store are specialty items from Hawaii."}
{"text":"This place it's amazing. They have exotics from time to time like marlin. They are very consistent and friendly. Reminds me of Hawaii every time i go in there. I don't price shop when I find quality of this level but it seems very reasonably. I own a landscape company and we have a Thursday route that is right by them. I wish we had a route by them every day. You guys should get stickers made. I would put them on our trailers. A Better Lawn & Sprinkler would do some free advertising for you guys :-). See you next Thursday."}
{"text":"Always a 5 star for me!! They best poke place Ive ever tried in my life!!! Im so sad they relocate because this place is so far. I might have to start going back to the Craig one. 

Everything is so fresh and flavorful!!!!
Great staff!!!!!!

Spicy Ahi, Kim Chi Tako and Tako wasabi are a must!!!!!! You can also get some drinks from their fridge for less than $2.00"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for years and I dont know why I never did a review on yelp (cause I always post it on IG). This is the only poke place I like!!! Been to other poke places here and in other states and nothing compare to this place! I just love this place and everyone that works here are soooo kind!!! They actually end up knowing me and know what I always get since I usually go here a lot!! They have 2 locations and the nearest one for me is the one on craig but lately Ive been going to the Henderson location one since Im always around that area. Doesnt matter which location cause its still going to be fresh and delicious!

MUST get everything!!!! Lol"}
{"text":"The BEST place to get poke! Every time my colleague and I travel to Vegas (which is about twice a month) we always make a point to visit Poke Express. We would typically visit the other one, but sometimes it was a hassle to get there depending on where in the city we were working. When we found out that there was another one in Henderson we were excited! We had high expectations from the other location, but the Henderson location did not disappoint. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly, and the poke was spot on. We have tried every flavor of the ahi poke and our favorites are the furikake, and spicy mayo. We also love the kimchi cucumbers and seaweed salad. We love this place so much that when we can we pack a to-go bag and take it back home with us. Airport security always gets a kick out of it. Just be sure to ask the staff at Poke Express to try to limit the amount of liquid in the container."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it more stars!!!

Every time my colleague and I are in Vegas (usually 1-2 times per month) we always make every effort to have at least one meal from Poke Express. It is amazing! It is a small place with no seating so you have to plan to take it to go. But what it lacks in seating it makes up for in flavor. There are so many options. For fish they have tuna, salmon, octopus, eel, and imitation crab. For sauces they have furikake, spicy mayo, spicy avocado, and I am likely forgetting some. We have tried most all of them and have not found one that we didn't like. We also get the seaweed salad and kimchi cucumbers. 

This place also gets huge points for consistency. The fish is always fresh, the store is always clean, and the staff are always friendly! 

We love this place so much that one time we bought insulated bags and ice packs so that we could bring some of the delicious poke back to Reno to share with our husbands. They loved it!"}
{"text":"amazingggg took forever to get here. got 2 1/3 pound and a 1/2 pound. $20.50 oy soo expensive. but hey thats poke anywhere. if u get the poke with shoyu sauce. get it on the side. i got in on it and it was drenched and was too much. the ahi with spicy mayo was the best. ill come back but ya poke is expensive."}
{"text":"Working in Vegas and was looking for something different and was just taking a chance to see if there are poke restaurants in the Sin city and lo and behold Yelp had several listed.  My attention was directed to Poke Express based on 5 star ratings and the close proximity to our North Las Vegas data center.  I had to wait for Thursday since they are closed on Wednesday.  The glass shelf have a lot of selections and the young kid offered samplings to about 6 items that I asked about so very accommodating and friendly.  I bought a total of 3 different pokes and seaweed salad and rice and the first bite made me feel like I am back in Hawaii.  I plan to hit this place a couple of more times before heading back to the Bay Area.  Add this to my Vegas favorites when I return."}
{"text":"The family and I came here to satisfy our craving for poke.  Don't be discouraged by the empty trays, they will mix the poke fresh to order.  We ended up getting the ahi limu, shoyu and salmon poke.  All the fish was super fresh and so ono.  Guys behind the counter are very helpful and welcoming.  We also ended up ordering from their front counter the typical plate lunches...katsu chicken, teri chicken and bbq beef.  Didn't try any of the plate lunches but the hubby and the kids came away full and satisfied.  I ordered the oxtail soup instead.  The meat was falling off the bone.  It was yummy in it's fatty, brothy glory.  It came with two scoops of rice plus add'l garnishes (green onions & grated ginger).  

They close earlier than Island Sushi and they have a few tables if you want to eat in.  I believe you can also bring your food and eat on the Island Sushi side, but you have to order $40 of rolls from Island Sushi.  

Can't wait to return to Poke Express on our next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas, I must eat here!! Poke Express has the BEST Poke I've ever tasted and I'm never disappointed!!  Not sure what to get, you can sample everything. They also sell Hawaiian products, chocolate covered macadamia nuts, ice cream, pancake mixes, spices, drinks, and chips, etc.  I love their POKE!!

::Highlight::
I LOVE the Kim Chee Cucumbers, Ocean Salad 
Spicy Ahi Poke, Spicy Wasabi Poke, and the Smoked Tako!!!!  The poke is always fresh and flavorful!!  I like to pair some of the poke with their Shoyu sauce; just ask for it.  My favorite drink is the Hawaiian Sun Lilikoi Passion but I also like the Guava Nectar, Passion Orange Drink, and the Strawberry-Guava Nectar.  Each one has different blends of tropical flavor.

Everyone is always happy and friendly!  Thank you, Mike, and Drew for being so kind to us!! 

::Tip::
There are food places in the plaza that serves brown rice.  Eat it with brown rice or the shrimp chips, it's good!! 

::M's Notes::
-Do you like garlic?  Their new item is the Garlic Bulbs, it's marinated and it has a garlic kick to it!
-You can purchase the poke by the pound (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uhQHvFNKAbLPRUEnAXGVuQ&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)."}
{"text":"I really love this place!! The Poke is amazing and they have a great selection. The service & staff are wonderful! It's a little out of the way from where I live but so worth the drive!! And the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Bomb poke! Best in North Las Vegas, this place delivers the goods!"}
{"text":"Poke? Here in Vegas? YUP! And it is soooo tasty!

For those who do not know and are thinking, \"what the heck is Poke?!?!?!\", let me explain. 

Think what tartare is to steak, poke is to fish (tuna mostly), octopus, squid, shrimp or another seafood meat. Now - there is a HUGE variety of seasonings that can be added to them: onion, garlic, pepper, salt, soy sauce, oil, seaweed (many varieties as well), tend to be among the most common items used. So it's kinda hard to review each variety - ya just gotta try 'em all!

And yes you can get samplers before you buy! 

The fish selection is always perfect and tends to be extremely tender. Not too chewy, and not too soggy, but juuuust right! Pricing tends to go along with the market fare, so it can be pricey depending on what you want. So you order and pay by the pound for your poke.

Now, the supply flies away! So if you want to get your poke ya have to go when they open or soon after!!!! But don't worry - if there isn't any out on display fear not, they tend to make it according to order!

And yes folks, this is up in N. Las Vegas! While it seems few and far, there are precious gems to find up this way in the valley. :) So there ya have it!

Not sure if you can do telephone orders or not, but wouldn't hurt to ask!"}
{"text":"Awesome place great food. People here are very friendly they give you samples to make sure you like what you are going to by. I had the imitation crab salad which was bomb then a bunch of poke. I ate some of it raw but it was actually really good when I made it in a stir fry rice which one of the guys working there suggested. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am crazy about poke - i can eat it everyday.  There's not a lot of places in town to get poke or at least where you can choose from various selections.  So I'm thrilled that this location is in town.  I remember during recent trips to Oahu I would walk into an everyday market and it feels like you're in an ice cream shop sampling and deciding between 31 flavors or varieties of octopus, salmon, tuna, oyster poke.  

Poke Express is definitely the poor man's version but hey were not in Hawaii so gotta lower expectations.  I liked how you can get poke freshly made to order after 1pm.  The furikake was definitely my favorite at 15-16 bucks a pound.

Sadly the taco with limu, lomi lomi, and seaweed salad did not taste as fresh.  I still ate every bite of it but it just wasn't up to par with the furikake. 

Navigating your way out of the parking lot onto Eastern can be a b1tch but that doesn't stop all the Hawaiians and poke fans from coming her and I'll make my way back. This place will hold me over till I find my way back to Hawaii."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap! They're super understanding and nice.. I'm new to poke, but they explained each category and gave free samples, even though it was close to closing time. I'm not even Hawaiian, I just have a raw fish addiction."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto Poke Express on our way to Island Sushi.  And since Island Sushi only had bar seating left, something the mister doesn't like, we luckily ended up at Poke Express, and things in the world are much better for it.

Poke Express is not the kind of place to take a girl/boy you're trying to wine and dine, it's not the kind of place you go to have a chatty dinner with a girlfriend you haven't seen for a while.  It's a minimally-decorated, brightly-lit, take-out counter, no tablecloths and paper napkins kind of place.  But if you are looking for some little-fuss and much-quality Hawaiian poke with a lot of authenticity and warmth, then this is the place.

We had the Hawaiian Ahi Poke and Deluxe Fried Noodles and were satisfied with both.  Hawaiian Poke was very flavorful and had large pieces of very fresh fish: only $7.95 for half a pound.  Deluxe Fried Noodles was stir-fried saimin (Hawaiian egg noodle that tastes a tad like ramen) with spam, BBQ pork, and fish cake.  There could have been a little more meat and less noodle but it was still delicious.  I recommend putting a little Sriracha hot sauce on both, it adds a little bit of heat and a lot of favor.

I was already a fan, when I spotted their sweet treats on our way out.  I tried the banana bread, wow, what a familiar memory of terrific sweetness.  It is like the Vietnamese banana bread, but lighter in texture and sweeter in taste.  It is definitely my new favorite breakfast snack."}
{"text":"If I can add 5 more stars I would. Best Poke ever!!! Updating my review coz I'm back in town and yup, still feel the same way. Love everything in their menu. My go to is Ahi Limu and Salmon Poke, but try it all! They will give samples, just ask.  They are always nice regardless who is there and lately they will make the raw poke fresh from the back which adds to it. If you like poke... This is the place to go to."}
{"text":"Plenty of poke spots popping up around vegas lately but nothing beats Poke Express, it's not like the completely replicated big food chain poke spots. mad love goes into their food an it shows every time I've visited. Must try spot especially before 2pm, can't beat the poke bowl special they have."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would, they committed credit card fraud and then wouldn't own up to it. They changed my tip amount to more than twice what I wrote down and when I called to talk to them they adjusted it and then told me I must be wrong or my bank got it wrong. I get emails for every transaction and can see the old transaction record and the new one that went in right before they called me back. I can forgive a mistake but outright dishonesty is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Best Loaded Inari w/ Spicy Ahi and Poke in town!!!Awesome customer service, always serving with Aloha!!"}
{"text":"Awesome family owned seafood deli! Me and my coworkers devour the tuna and salmon poke on a regular basis! I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Poke.  I like that you can order several different kinds in smaller containers as oppose to only getting one larger portion.  It's a little weird, there are three different restaurants all in one shared area.  There is a sushi place and a hawaiian BBQ place.  It's cool if you have people who don't want the same thing as you.  Very casual atmosphere where you order at the counter.  Many different kinds of poke to chose from.  Would go there again.  I went to the other hawaiian place across from LVAC in that shopping center, and Poke Express is much better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Hours in Yelp doesn't match hours on their sign which says 6PM... Showed up at 5:30PM with the employees inside and the door LOCKED! Even the employee didn't have the courtesy to look up and say they're closed since they shouldn't have been, after all it was not 6PM and it still isn't 6PM after this review."}
{"text":"Best place to grab your Poke! Always fresh and the owner is always so nice. We come here for the Raw kim chee crab, mussel poke, spicy wasabi, ahi poke w/ limu and my fave their spicy avocado."}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find.  On the outside the big sign says Island Sushi and Grill.  There was only a little paper sign that said Poke Express.  Other than it being hard to find I love this place!  

I came to Vegas to gamble of course but I wanted to go eat where the locals go so again THANK YOU YELP!

I have only had really good poke in Hawai'i and I must say, this place is legit.  They have various types of marinated fresh fish that you can buy to take home in this little market area in the back or you can just order a bowl of poke which I did.  It was pretty outstanding, not as good as Sam's Kitchen in Waikiki but it was really good coming from the mainland.  Do not get the Spam Masubi though.  Way too much rice, way too little spam.

Stick with the fish.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Poke place by far. Staff very friendly they really brought the ALOHA to Vegas besides the fish. Great selection!!"}
{"text":"Great poke in Vegas. This place is inside of Island Sushi. On Thursdays they have poi. Last time I was in Vegas, it was HANALEI poi, which is my favorite after Waipio Valley poi.  Pretty good variety of poke too. I was excited to see they had raw kim chee tako. And was 'ono too!!! I will be back everytime I'm in Vegas to visit 'ohana."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I get 20$ worth of fish and then 10$ worth of material
(Rice, seaweed, vinegar etc) and I make sushi at home! They really have the best poke and at great value too. I go to maui every year and I am so glad I have a piece of  Hawaii in my backyard"}
{"text":"Hella craving ahi poke tuna! Came here cuz my mom found it. Ehhhhh on their cutomer service. There are 3 areas to place food orders very confusing for 1st timers. There are several ppl here waiting for ever. Every1 has numbers but no food on their table. No one greets u when u 1st walk in as many people as there are smh"}
{"text":"I cannot believe it has taken me this long to get around to posting a review for Poke Express!

Short version: Poke Express is awesome; go there now!

Medium version:  Poke Express is awesome!  I discovered it shortly after moving to Las Vegas, and I am simultaneously sad and happy there isn't one closer to my house.  Sad because I don't get to go as often as I want, but my wallet is happy because I would spend WAAAY more money than I should on poke if it was close by.  

I love the variety of poke that they have (at least 6 varieties of tuna poke that I can think of, salmon poke, octopus poke, shrimp poke, mussel poke, etc...) and most importantly, they use good quality seafood.  No stringy/chewy pieces!  Their prices are reasonable too, considering it's good seafood that they are selling.  And the people are super nice and friendly too!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"As a big fan of Poke this is the best place in Vegas for Poke.  It is Hawaiian style and remind me of Ono Seafood in Waikiki.  They have several to chose from which can make it tough to choose.  
   I got the spicy Avocado Ahi which was fresh and delicious.  The spicy Ahi with masago and mayo was perfection.  The taste was to die for and the Ahi just melted in your mouth.  We got a 1/4 pound of the seasoned dry skipjack tuna which was also amazing.  We got the seasoned garlic bulbs which were not overpowering at all.  I really enjoyed their unique flavor.  We also got the Kimchee cucumbers and imitation crab which were both a tasty treat.
   The staff is excellent and helpful.  They had run out of the spicy Ahi but they quickly made us a fresh batch.  This was my 2nd visit and I will definitely be back.  The quality of their Poke s truly amazing.  The freshness made me think I was in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Great Place. Family owned and ran. gotta try the spicy ahi."}
{"text":"Delicious! This place is amazing. The owner and staff are absolutely wonderful and very accommodating. They are more than happy to give out samples and to me, those samples got me hooked!

Every morsel is packed with flavor. I particularly like the Spicy Poke Combo and Wasabi Poke. Yum! Fresh and mighty tasty."}
{"text":"The poke is AWESOME here. I come to visit my family in Vegas at least twice a year and every time I'm there we always stop by poke express and usually get the kim chi tako, ahi poke w/limu, ahi poke w/avocado. 

The prices were expensive when I came out in August 2012 because of a shortage in fish, but it's still cheap compared to other places so AINOKEA. 

Definitely check it out! It's in the corner of a shopping plaza so its pretty easy to find."}
{"text":"There's a reason Poke Express has a solid 5 star rating with the amount of reviews that it has.  Poke on its own is absolutely delicious and amazing, but what really sets this place apart is the owner.

For an \"express\" eatery, the customer service that Darren and company present is above and beyond what you would expect.  He takes incredible pride in what they produce.

Upon hearing that my friends and I were from New York, he insisted that we sample every single one of the pokes they had available, with absolutely no obligation to buy anything.  The passion with which they believe in their product and authentic happiness they express for your enjoyment of their stock is infectious.

Of course my companions and I ended up getting a few pounds of poke.  It doesn't matter how full you might be, there's always room for pounds of poke!"}
{"text":"I get so excited when I go to this haven of yumminess. Try the seaweed salad , wasabi cucumbers are so refreshing, the tuna with advacado, and a plethora of all things poke. Do not , I repeat, do not, order from the hot food section of this place, they truly move at the a laid back Hawaiian pace. They don't give a damn about speed, or trying to get you out of there to make room for other customers. How long does it take to fry a piece of chicken? Just go with the poke, trust me, it's not worth it to even get a musubi, they will take twenty minutes for something that is already pre- prepared."}
{"text":"Of all the poke places in town, I think this is the best. The flavors are on point. Everything is well seasoned and delicious. The only negative is the price of poke went through the roof!!! It used to be way cheaper. Kind of mad prices nearly doubled."}
{"text":"always delicious, always fresh! they never disappoint. best place in vegas to get fresh poke!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to the strip after a long drive in from LA.  Being a local boy living in Stockton for the past 8 years, any fresh poke, let alone fresh fish/seafood definitely gets my attention.  It was located inside of Island Sushi (which I didn't get to try unfortunately).  Upon walking in, there is a bakery case which they offer local favorites such as coco puffs, various local (Hawaii) cakes and pies (whole or by the slice) which is always perfect if you wanna try all of um! haha.  They also offer malasads, which I wanted my girlfriend to try since she hadn't had the pleasure to have the last time she was in Hawaii.  After ordering the malasads, we headed to the back counter where their friendly staff were very attentive and ready to take our order.  Their spread was pretty impressive for poke shop no where near the ocean.  Fresh ahi poke (limu, shoyu, maui onion), taegu, raw hawaiian blue crab poke, assorted tako poke, pipikaula, ocean salad, and much more.  We ordered just a 1/4 pound each of the ahi limu and pipikaula for just some pupus (snacks) as we were headed to the strip for lunch.   Upon paying, we noticed they had chantilly cake which we decided to grab as well.
In tasting them, the malasads were wonderful!  Nice and hot and delicious.  While not as good as Leonard's back home, they were very close to them, a little too much of the oil taste, but come on its malasads!  The ahi limu poke was great too.  Their seasoning was spot on, and the limu was nice and crunchy.  The pipikaula as good too.  Different than how I usually have had it, where it was more moist (wet) style.  I do prefer it more on the dry side, but it was great nonetheless!  The chantilly cake was pretty bomb.  Nice fluffy cake with not too much overbearing sweetness from the frosting (which really destroys some good cakes).  While it was quite of a juxtaposition with the poke and malasads, the bugga was good and definitely made me miss home even more.  Great local spot to fill up on your local foods.  Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Yum! The four of us had a bit of everything and it was all great, A nice hole in the wall I would have never found without Yelp! The Kalua pork was to die for. Perfectly seasoned, moist and tender. My wifes Eggplant Pork was just as good with a totally different flavor profile. I could have eaten a whole pint of the Tuna Poke."}
{"text":"I'm always picky when it comes to poke, but I think this is the best for Vegas! Not the same as home but it's pretty close! I like that they ask you if you want the shoyu on top or on the side. They also have a little grocery section with snacks, juice, frozen laulaus, etc.  Not sure what the young boys name is, but he always remembers my boyfriend and gives awesome service! True aloha coming out of this spot! Must try if you're in the area :)"}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to my house!!! We saw the great reviews and pics so we decided to make the long drive up to North Vegas to check it out for ourselves. It did not disappoint. They had a large variety different poké available. The flavors were great and the fish was fresh. We tried the furukake ahi and the shoyu ahi. We planned to take our food home to eat but we couldn't resist opening it up in the car to get a taste. By the time we got home we had almost finished one container. Good thing we got two! 

Be sure to try the different Hawaiian sun drinks they have for sale as well as the saimin and the Zippys chili. After living in Hawaii for 10 years, this place brought back some great memories of the food I miss eating on a daily basis back in Hawaii. We'll be back to try new flavors of poké soon!"}
{"text":"Buggah was ono!  Broke da mouth!  Even if you don't speak pigeon, you'll be saying these phrases after consuming the poke here.  

Super friendly \"aloha\" service...they allow you to sample anything you want.  Poke was really fresh and the flavors were delicious.  Tasted just like Hawaii, possibly better than a lot of other places I've been to.  The spicy ahi and spicy ahi wasabi were my favorite flavors.  It reminded me of Genki Sushi's spicy ahi.  

This is a definite stop for me the next and every time I come back to sin city.I wish Poke Express was located here in the bay!"}
{"text":"Delicious!

The spicy tuna bowl is so fantastic. 

I had it with brown rice and added avocado (A very generous portion might I add) and was IN HEAVEN!

I have been back 2 times since the first time eating here and I can't wait to go back again!

I also had their spicy imitation crab from the deli counter and that was delicious."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews on Yelp and my undying craving for poke, I decided to give this a whirl.

I drove over here on Saturday afternoon to pick up some lunch.  They had a lot of choices but I went for:

- 1/2 lbs of the Furikake Poke
- 1/2 lbs of the Hawaiian Style Poke

I also saw that they had some Lau lau in the freezer so I picked some of that up for another time.  2 Lau Lau for under $9 seems like a really good deal.

The poke was fresh and very good.  Completely satisfied with the taste.  Even though the location is pretty far out of the way from me on Craig Rd, I think I'll be making the trek at least twice a month.  

The women behind the counter were very nice and let me sample anything I wanted.  There wasn't very much Furikake Poke left but she offered to make some fresh for me and it came out very quick.

The store was really nice as well and wasn't too busy when I came by around 3pm.

There wasn't anywhere to sit and eat here, like I thought there would be.  This is more of a store where you buy and eat somewhere else.  They do send you off with chopsticks to go.

My one wish for this place - that they would open a location somewhere closer to me in Summelrin. I bet they'd get good business on the west side of town.

I recommend this place for anyone wanting some genuine Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I live down the street from this place and we would always drive by it. One day my girlfriend pointed it out on the way home so we decided to stop by. It's a small market/store that sells poke by the weight. They also carry small sides such as seaweed salad. 

They have shelves along the side where they sell dry goods. My girlfriend spotted one product in particular. I guess it's a chili powder that you sprinkle on mangos and what not. She said one of her family members back home always gets excited when they find it, so I am assuming that it is a product that is hard to find. 

The going rate for poke was $14.95/pound. They offer military discount for $12.95/pound. My girlfriend and I were trying to figure out which tuna we wanted and the guy helping us offered some samples. I really loved the customer service here! It looked like the poke was continuously being made fresh. During the few minutes that I was there, they brought out several trays of different poke and side dishes.  

I normally try to scope out different poke spots around the area, but they tend to be on the pricey side. I like that I can come here to save money/make my own poke bowls at home. The price and quality seem to be perfect for me and the customer service was outstanding. I will continue coming here for my poke needs."}
{"text":"There is no doubt in my mind that this place easily gets five stars. I have a poke addiction and they know how to satisfy every inch of it. They made it fresh for me too! There's so much flavor in each of the different ones. I got three different ones and wish I would've gotten a pound of each!  I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Best Poke in Vegas! Love this place and the selection.  Little disappointed when I walked out to my car and realized I was still in Nevada! Friendly people serving great food."}
{"text":"Picked up some delicious poke in-between games during the last LVI tournament in LV.  Our daughter was playing and we told her to take it easy, but that didn't stop us (lol!)...

Actually, I had heard that there was a Yelp UYE event that morning but by the time we had gotten there they must have dined and dashed.  Much of the ahi under the counter was gone, but the owner said \"no worries\" and offered to make us some fresh from the back http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poke-express-north-las-vegas?select=9Mto2GARkgh9NYhFUHphzw#vZUp_KgAKw2h-ar4vAp30g;  SUPER COOL!  They don't have any tables within PE, so he also volunteered that we might go a couple of door's down to 808 Mixed Plate;  so friendly...

This is why I will be coming back whenever I'm in town..."}
{"text":"Excellent Poke also they carry a wide array of Hawaiian products, so go down there check m out!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. We were craving poke and we found the best spot. This place all sorts of variety, even my favorite tako wasabi.

I order the salmon poke and tako wasabi. Tako wasabi is pretty much the same everywhere. Nonetheless it hit the spot. 

My salmon with ponzu sauce was really good too. Tasted fresh and very flavorful chunks.

My uncle ordered the fried tofu and one of the tako pokes. They were both really good as well. 

My only con about this place is that they close at 6:00 which is pretty early for Vegas, or anywhere.

They have a few other Hawaiian and Japanese snacks and refrigerated items. I was also even tempted to buy a jar of of pickled takuwan."}
{"text":"Coming from a tiny island full of fresh seafood, I used to mourn the lack of good poke in Vegas. Then one day I stumbled upon this place when a customer where I work let me try their scallop poke...and it was da booomb. Now this is the only poke place I will go to in Las Vegas. You are greeted with warm aloha, you have a variety to select  from, and the quality and taste are clearly there in their food. They definitely know what they're doing, okay. I'm here at least once a week to satisfy my poke craving, and I cannot emphasize how highly I recommend this place."}
{"text":"long line@ the poke station. long wait on the grill side. but everyone is so nice and food is really good!"}
{"text":"We love poke! This is the place to go if you're craving the sweet delectable fish treat. We've been here a few times and the staff and products never disappoint. They have many different poke varieties. Try them all. I just wish this place were closer to me."}
{"text":"Best Poke I've found in Vegas, friendly service, and plenty of choices. Shoyu Ahi Poke, Furikake Ahi Poke, Kimchee Crab are our favorites. Made to order and to your preferences, too. Around 12 bucks/pound for the Ahi Poke, and totally worth it.

As other's have said, it's made from frozen tuna, but it's still fantastic.
Only bummer are the business hours:
Sunday - Thursday   10 AM - 6 PM
Friday and Saturday 10 AM - 8 PM 

Go get some !!!!"}
{"text":"If you love Hawaiian style poke, you need to visit this place! They have so many different kinds (tuna, salmon, octopus, mussels, scallops, etc.) and they all taste fresh. The pokes are sold by the pound. They also offer you samples to try before you decide. I love the ahi tuna, seasoned top shell, seasoned baby octopus, and kimchi Tako. You can also have a poke combo. Rice is $0.75 a scoop. No dining tables though, so you have to get your food to go."}
{"text":"Love the Hawaiian style pike offered here. Purchase by weight. Also have tako, mussels, clams and ako. 

Definitely recommend coming here when in Vegas and craving traditional style poke."}
{"text":"I love poke.  How can I not give Poke Express 5 stars.  

The choices that you can get here at Poke Express are amazing.  Kim Chee poke, Spicy Avocado Poke, Salmon Poke (I need to try that one!!!)  The list goes on and on.  Just imagine a regular super market deli but all poke!  All of the pokes run about $16.99 per lb which is kinda steep but you indulge in this flavorful poke any chance you get.

I have only had the Spicy Avocado Poke but it was amazing.  They let us try out the poke before buying it which is really nice of them, considering each piece is a hefty chunk of the almost extinct tuna... my bad mother earth, tuna tastes too darn good.  My family was able to share a 1/2 lb container with our lunch and have some extra.

The first time I passed by Poke Express I thought they were still building the store because it is surrounded by a bunch of empty store fronts.  Second time I saw the actual store and almost slapped myself in the face for missing it the first time.  There is a second location inside of Island Sushi in the Plaza hotel but it is a more limited selection of flavors.  It may be more convenient to get to though!

The owner is super nice and he is fun to talk to.  My parents had a nice little convo about back home in Hawaii.  I will definitely be coming back to load up on some more poke flavors!  It goes great with the plate lunches down the street at 808 Mixed Plate, another one of my favorites :D"}
{"text":"Not much when it comes to customer service.  They have poke \"bowls\" but won't make you one after 5pm which is a bit idiotic to me.  I asked why but the response was so weird I forgot what it was.  The quality is there except for the mussels - they tasted as gamey as they looked.  Otherwise, they try to have variety but in essence its either salmon, ahi, tofu, mussels, seaweed salad, edamame... they price by the pound so its more of a deli than anything."}
{"text":"Alright, I'll admit it, I was one of those skeptics who thought there was no way a place called Poke Express in North Las Vegas could have a legitimate 5-star rating. I was wrong...

Poke Express is a small deli-type store which serves... you guessed it... poke! For those of you who do not know, poke is small cuts of fish (mostly tuna) that are seasoned and served cold. The poke selection is not as big as those you would find in Hawaii' but you got to remember you're in the middle of the desert. 

Ahi Shoryu Poke - Tasted fresh with a slight soy sauce flavor?

Dempura? - Fish cakes, tasted just like that which you would get at a Korean restaurant, so if you like those, then you will definitely like this one.

Spicy Combo Poke - The money of all pokes. The slight spicy kick is what really set this poke over the edge. Beware though as this poke is not \"light\".

Rice w/ Furikake - At first I wasn't quite sure if I wanted rice, but after furikake was mentioned I had to get myself an order. For only $1.50 you get a pretty good amount of rice and the furikake adds exceptional taste.

The one thing that really made Poke Express was the great service. The owner was a nice Hawaiian man who really spent time to explain all the different types of poke and let us try EVERYTHING we wanted to try. He was very patient and definitely made the experience very pleasant for everyone. On top of that he could definitely hold down a good conversation.

Overall: If you love poke than you will love Poke Express."}
{"text":"Best. Poke. Ever. Traditional Hawaiian style. I LOVE that this place sells poke by weight instead of in the currently trendy bowls that are becoming so ubiquitous. Friendly staff, reasonable prices, and great selection. Do yourself a favor and get some!!!"}
{"text":"Still consistently outstanding per my last visit there yesterday before heading back to the OC.  Heard that they were moving to a bigger location by August 1 with this Sunday being their last day at the Island Sushi location.  I will be checking out the new location (215 and Stephanie St) when I am back in Vegas first week in August."}
{"text":"We were so happy to visit the new location this past Labor Day weekend.  The new location was easy to find and had a large selection of local food from Hawaii.  The Poke remains their \"headliner\" and we left as happy souls with our purchase of kimchee tako/mussels, poke w/limu, shoyu poke, spicy salmon, smoked marlin/tako, seasoned dried aku, and the kulolo poke.  We actually had to go back to see if we could get more kulolo poke but we had bought all of it...hint..they get their lulolo on Fridays and by Monday, it is sold out...Great staff...Best wishes on the new location, we will be back whenever we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I actually found this place on yelp years ago,I figured I see. A lot of kama'ainas, they gotta get food somewhere .. Now I can't go to Vegas without coming here for my poke fix... Best poke in the mainland... Period...reminds me of getting poke at Foodland...I'll be back there soon... Aaauuuu raaiiiii!!!!"}
{"text":"The best poke in town. I've been to both locations and they are both great. They have always been helpful when making selections and are always friendly. If you are wanting salmon make sure to get there early; they run out of salmon pretty quick. The ahi poke kim chi style is so good! If you are looking for good prices and a delicious selection this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Another poke winner. Service was nice and the poke was delicious. Love it that they have salmon poke.  It's not traditional, but it tastes great!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best poke shop we've been to. The owner is so nice. We bought 1/4 of 5 different items to try. Everything was great. We especially liked the salmon furikake. Went next door to 808 Hawaiian Mixed Plates to get some rice and eat there."}
{"text":"Poke Poke Poke! What about Gumby, huh?
Seriously it's a cool place with friendly people.
A great variety of Poke that even Hawaii can't match, but in the long run the Poke in Hawaii is a bit better, but that is because of it's geographical advantage. I must have some Hawaiian roots because these Poke items really twangs my buds!
The Saimin and grill side is OK too. We did try some Saimin and Udon and for the money it's a great deal. The noodles are decent, but will have to admit the broth is kind of watery and bland (at least the day we had it). No worries we did put some additional soy sauce and a few drops of sirachi and it sparked things right up. The deserts are good too. Weeknights they close at 6pm so you gotta rush in dare Brudha! Aloha, Mahola and Aloha!"}
{"text":"If you give this place a rating of anything less then 4 stars then you better seek help cause something is totally wrong with you."}
{"text":"Can we talk about why on earth there's poke rivaling Hawaii in Vegas?? I don't know the answer, but it's here, and it's delicious! We walked in on a Sunday at 2:30 and there was a line full of Hawaiians. Be warned this is a hole in the wall. There's no where to sit, so take out only. I heard rumors that they had rice, but there wasn't any when we were there. Go a couple of doors down to the teriyaki place and get a side of rice. Everything was amazing. Since I'm from a state where REAL Poke is rare and almost impossible to find, I'll be there for breakfast on my way out of town."}
{"text":"We arrived at poke express with 10 minutes to spare.  The lady behind the counter was SUPER nice and made me wish i really were in Hawaii.  They had put away the poke but she let me know it's made to order.  I was not disappointed. LOVE LOVE LOVED my furikake poke and hawaiian poke.  Next time i'm in vegas i for sure am going earlier to sample it all and to make a picnic out of it.!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love, this place.  The workers are friendly, fast, and efficient.  I wish there was a location in east las vegas because I would literally be there every single day!! I have to stock up when I go to henderson or north las vegas :):):)"}
{"text":"My parents are local (as in from Hawaii). It is really really REALLY hard to get local food, especially poke, that Mom approves of.  I love the Spicy Ahi from Poke Express. Today I brought some for Mom and she more than approves of their poke."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing.  This was my first experience with poke, and after just one stop I can now say that I am a huge fan.  We had the Hawaiian style ahi poke, the Spicy ahi poke, and some sashimi and it was all amazing. 

The store itself is this cool deli style set up and the folks working there will gladly let you try any of the offerings that you like until you find what you want.  The staff are extremely friendly and knowledgable and were happy to explain what was what to my wife and I as we embarked on our first poke experience. They have lots of other Hawaiian items in the store as well for your shopping pleasure. Prices were quite good and, as I mentioned above, the food is amazing. We were just there yesterday and I already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best Poke Place!  The food was fresh and the Owner's were really nice.  Went their early and the owner insisted that we try their poke and we were not disappointed.  Being  my first poke experience it rocked my world especially for the price.  Sushi quality food for half the price"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, authentic Hawaiian poke! My roulette dealer told me his family owned this place and I decided to check it out on my stay in LV.  Very impressed!  I just got the tuna poke, but everything they had looked and smelled amazing!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What can I say? THE BEST Poke in town!! Haven't had one bad thing from there and every time I go, it's like trying it for the first time...AMAZING! I've had it from both locations in town and both are equally good. If you are considering it, just try it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Poke Express, excellent, excellent poke! I am blessed to live nearby this gem. Their poke is the best, there are a wide variety of flavors to choose from and they will adapt them to your liking. Want extra something? You got it!  I made a beautiful lunch and returned with 8 different poke styles for my family from Tahiti to try and they were impressed! They went beyond poke and you are welcome to have a sample and go on a palate adventure with octopus and dried marlin ec... I love the ocean salad which is a seaweed salad and often they also have rice available. I always bring my little ice chest with blocks if I have to travel, this time I did not come in with it and they offered some ice! I loved that!

They have a variety of other delectables too for you to try as well as in the refrigerated area with linguisa, salmon belly, desserts, as well as packaged foods, and t-shirts etc...
It is like going to Hawaii on vacation. It is a family run business and everyone is treated like Ohana! (family)

This is a to go place, however Teryaki Madness does not mind if you order some food in their restaurant and eat your poke. Sometimes I grab a pair of chopsticks and sit outside on the wall and I enjoy each and every bite!"}
{"text":"Good poke but I still prefer Hawaiian Style Poke. The Tako poke was unusually sweet and the shipping limu poke was good. I liked that you can get a 1 lb tray of sashimi and they have a double fridge filled with Hawaiian goodies. They need a location in the Southwest part of Vegas."}
{"text":"Holy crap I was not expecting this at all. Most of the poke I've had is very bland and this one had tons of flavor! Poke avocado bowl for under $10 bucks? Come onnnn. And the portion is well worth it. I'm a huge poke fan and this by far is my favorite. Thanks poke express!"}
{"text":"Can't give anything less than 5 stars for Poke Express. Fish is so fresh Will Smith would be demoted to court jester here! 

Tip: Come early or phone in your order to get the most selection. They sell out of salmon faster. 

Service was very nice. Free samples help reduce buyers' remorse. Noteworthy items we ordered: crab combo, wasabi tako, and the salmon poke with house sauce. 

Warning: Your eyes may be bigger than your stomach!"}
{"text":"Go about 10am thats when the fresh stuff hits the shelves. They are very nice when it comes to samples. They will help you select what's best for your taste buds."}
{"text":"This is a four star rating because I was super disappointed in the fact they don't have a lobby to sit and eat. Fortunately the fish was amazing! The staff was polite while offering samples of any fish you'd like to try.  I ended up getting the spicy avocado poke, and the salmon sashimi. Both were super delicious and very fresh. It's like a fish deli."}
{"text":"Although this place isn't close to where we live, we went all the way over there to try their poke after reading the good reviews about this place.  My wife ordered their ahi poke bowl and I had the oxtail soup.  The oxtail soup was very tasty and you get quite a big bowl for $9.00.  You also get two scoops of rice with it.  The ahi poke bowl was just okay.  You get quite a big portion of tuna on top of a big bowl of rice, but the ahi wasn't tasty enough and it didn't taste all that fresh. A big disappointment for my wife.  The place was quite busy though.  If we lived closer, we might go back to try something else.  But not worth the half hour trip there.
."}
{"text":"Try the Kim Chee Mussels. They're soo fresh & tasty. My husband loves the furukaki ahi poke & my son LOVES their soybeans. 
I'm soo glad there's a place like this. Their poke tastes more fresh than some places back @ home in Hawaii.
You can also purchase some Hawaii products in there. Great POKE!"}
{"text":"I have looked for a poke place several times across vegas, and have usually had to resort to Whole Foods to get it, that was until I found this beacon of hope. Unlike the selection at Whole Foods, this place has a ton of variety and at the times I've went ---it's been freshly made. I highly recommend the any of the poke with mayo! The staff is very friendly and quick to get your order ready."}
{"text":"If you know me. . you know I love Poke! A LOT!!

Whenever I see Poke on a menu. . .even if I haven't tried it. . I usually get it. But this place. . .is HEAVEN for me!! Poke is located inside of Island Sushi which I have yet to try and probably will because I vow to go to Poke Express every time I visit Las Vegas. 

The gentleman that served us was really patient and allowed us to try a couple of different flavors of Poke and sure enough they were all delicious! I ended up getting the Limu Poke and the Spicy Poke! I can't wait to come back again! I wish we had one here in the bay area! hmm...possible business in the works?!? If only I knew how to make Poke! But, someone please open a Poke Express in the bay area! I'd love you forever and ever!!"}
{"text":"Good Lord this place is fantastic!

If you've had poke before, then don't bother reading the reviews, go get some!

If you're on the fence about trying poke from here, don't be. Drive over, swing in and try the samples. They'll let you sample anything prior to buying it. Best of all, when they run out, they run out. No lowering quality just to make a buck. They seem to keep a high level of quality control.

I've gotten poke from here any time I'm in the area. I've never gotten a bad order or have been disappointed. They've even helped me pack an order for my family to transport to Colorado. Very good service.

Okay, is this place like eating in Hawaii? No. You're in Las Vegas. Surrounded by deserts. Tuna has to be sent here frozen, so taste will drop. That's not to say this place isn't tasty, because it is. Just realize that the negative reviews may be placing unrealistic standards.

Bottom line is to go here and try the poke for yourself. It's good!"}
{"text":"This place is so legit! All the employees are super helpful. Today was my first day coming here and it definitely won't be my last. I also think the prices are super affordable for such good quality poke."}
{"text":"First time I heard of this style I was on Maui and the locals took me to the spot. I enjoyed the dish and flavors of Eskimo candy. Finding someone who specializes in it around Vegas made my day."}
{"text":"We tried the ahi/avocado poke bowl and it was super delicious. We also tried the katsu from the other side of the store and it was decent. But we will back here to try more of the poke because it was just so good!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to get different types of fresh and delicious poke!! Love the selection and how you can order it by the 1/4, 1/2 or full pound. They also do poke bowls with rice. We will always come here for our fresh poke needs!!"}
{"text":"Ahhh....Maui all over again...at least it brings me back to my days in Maui when I sample the creamy ahi poke with the tobiko, the spicy wasabi poke, and the spicy avocado poke.  

This is my first time to Poke Express since it is in North Vegas.  I live in Hendo so I am rarely in N Vegas for anything.  Because I went to volunteer at Three Square this morning, I decided to make a trip out of this.  After Three Square, I went to the UFC Gym to sweat a bit, and head straight to Poke Express.  The time was 1:30pm, so I figured I might not get to sample many items since per the other reviews, it may not be available.  

Must be my lucky day because I get to sample  all types of ahi poke.  I decided on 1 lb of wasabi poke, 1/2 lb of creamy with tobiko poke, and 1/2 lb of spicy avocado poke.  All for only $32 pre-tip.  I raced home to share with my husband since we both enjoyed the poke in Maui together (in which the trip was for our wedding).  So, even though we may not be going to Maui anytime soon, we can get a taste of Maui by coming to Poke Express and get our ahi poke fix."}
{"text":"This really small spot is inside Island Grill. Chantelle was the girl at the counter , she was really friendly and patient. I asked her what her favorite was, she said everything. I planned to get 3 different kind in smallest container. I told her that it was my first time here so not sure which one I like. She offered me to sample anything looks good to me so I won't be disappointed with my choices. I got Spicy avocado Ahi, Salmon with shoyu sauce and Tako kimchi. 
I like them all, I will be back for more"}
{"text":"I found out that they have different pokes that Henderson's Poke Express (my regular poke store!) doesn't have through photos on Yelp. As a Poke lover, I had to come here and try different pokes...

[Things Eastern store doesn't have]
Shibazuke... Japanese shiso flavored pickles. Sour and salty. Great with rice.
Chuka iidako... Cute little octopus in Chinese flavor sauce. It's so tiny and cute. Get one for your kids just to look at! They'll love it.
Tempura poke... Why tempura? It's more like \"Furikake style kamaboko\" to me...
Sweet Chili Mussels... Salty but I liked it. Not sweet at all. A little spicy.
Ahi with oyster sauce... Love! Why doesn't Eastern store have this?! I don't understand. It's a popular flavor... Sad.

Everything I had was fresh and tasty just like I get in their Eastern store. The guys that were working there was so nice and helpful just like Eastern store. Probably, I would not drive all the way here just come to this store. I'm so lucky I live close to their Eastern store!"}
{"text":"Wow, thanks yelp! Who knew you could find awesome quality poke in LV? We stopped by here on our way out of town, followed the directions of other fellow yelpers to the back of the plate lunch restaurant. The owner was very nice and generous with the samples. We ended up getting the Shoyu, Furikake, Spicy, and Spicy Combo. Everything was delicious, but I'd say my favorite is the Furikake, with just the perfect amount of sweet. 

Just note though that I thought about docking one star because the prices were a lot more than I saw on other reviews. We paid $15 a pound for each, a big difference from the 10 and 11 I saw before coming. There's a sign up that says that the prices will fluctuate based on the market price. It does add up, but I didn't really mind since our tummies and taste buds were so satisfied. 

Make sure to bring a cooler and ice in the car and you can enjoy a delicious dinner after your long drive back to LA."}
{"text":"This place saved me!!! I was dying to get some ahi poke. Just a random craving so I turned to yelp and typed in ahi poke and this spot was the first one to pop out. Definitely a place to try for me since its pretty close to my house. I walked in, I was greeted right away. Then i walked to the counter to look at their poke flavors but nothing was on there! Turns out you just have to ask em and they make it for you. Fish tasted so fresh! The seasonings were on point. I dont usually write reviews for places but this definitely made me happy! My number 1 poke spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Can't believe I found this place. Everything is so fresh and the owner is just the nicest!  It's really nice to get a REAL taste of Hawaii.  I am so impressed!"}
{"text":"Best poke in Vegas! So glad they opened up another location, super nice staff and super amazing food. The poke is always super fresh and the price is really good too. The spicy ahi is probably my favorite but they're all insanely good!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice this week already the poke here is yummy I love the flavors, I've tried the spicy avocado poke, poke with limu, shoyu tako,and the seaweed salad all very good. I also bought some of their Hawaiian soy sauce and furikake seasoning."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I know all good things should be in moderation but I can't get enough of this place. They give you samples of everything so you can be sure you'll like it. It's a little pricey but that's the norm with any good fresh fish."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The service is super friendly and accommodating.  They let you sample pretty much anything you want, and if you have a special request, they're always happy to oblige.  The food is amazing.  I love poke and they have lots of options.  My favorite is the garlic ahi with shoyu, but everything I've tried has been tasty. The salmon is fresh and flavorful.  They have kimchi everything (tuna, octopus, cucumbers, crab, etc), which my wife loves.  You can't go wrong if you like seafood.  They also have a little shop area with Hawaiian and Asian products.  Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"*********************************Review # 800**********************************************

Poke(po-keh, NOT po-key) is another one of those local Hawaiian specialties that is near and dear to my heart. Back in high school while other friends were working retail or flipping burgers at fast food joints, I got a job with another friend at a local fishmarket.

Of course, it had its pros and cons-I knew nothing about cooking at the time, and we did just the grunt work of preparing the taro leaves and de-boning and cutting up pork butts to prepare for the ladies in the morning who would prepare Kalua Pig and Lau Lau, and clean bunches of green bananas so the boss could make his kick-ass Pasteles. Yeah, we would itch like hell from the taro leaves and reek  of the fishmarket when we got home, but at that time, it was all about having money to go out and kick it with friends and live it up like the teenagers we were.

During my time here, the boss even had enough trust in me to teach me how to make his different kinds of poke preparations and before you know it, I didn't have to do all that grunt work anymore. I ran the cash register and took care of preparing the different types of poke. The best compliment I got was when a little lady who's a regular came to get her usual fix of Ahi Limu Poke, then she asked for the boss... Crap! I thought I was gonna be in trouble for screwing her order up! The boss wasn't around and he was at his other location in town, so after I told her, she replied \"Oh, this tastes exactly like how he makes his poke\" That made my day, and I was sweating bullets for nothing!

Poke Express is one place that stirs up all those memories every time we stop in to feed our poke addiction. Owners Alison and Darren have brought the tastes of home to the 9th Island, and have created a huge fan base of local transplants and poke lovers as well!

There is also a variety local goodies and home accents on the back shelves, shirts, stickers, and hats up front and even a freezer section of local specialities you can purchase. Inside is very clean, and Iove that I feel like I'm home, especially hearing all the talking in pidgin from other local customers and even the owners themselves.

Ingredients are fresh as can be here and there are endless combinations of poke that they make on the spot. Undecided what to get? Ask for a sample! Our favorites right now are the Spicy Ahi, Ahi Limu, Ahi Shoyu, and Limu Tako Poke. Haven't seen Raw Crab, but if and when they do have it, I may just get some of that as well. The location is perfect, as it is on our side of town, and also a couple of doors down from another tasty local joint (808 Mixed Plate) The perfect accompaniment to poke? Go next door to the liquor store and get an ICE COLD BEER!  I bet you thought I was gonna say rice!?!?! SUCKA!!!! .......... :p      ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, finally found this place after 2 tries--  No one said it was in the same space as the take out side of Island Sushi!

Poke is fantastic.  Went limu and wasabi, both were so fresh and delicious!  This place definitely rivals my old standby, Hawaiian Poke in Chinatown, but earns bonus points for being closer to home.  

I got their late afternoon, to pick up a little something for dinner...  They were so friendly and nice, they offered to make me anything they were out of fresh on the spot!  

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So I was feeling blue one day and if you knew me (which most of you don't on a deep personal level...so take notes!), then you'd know that on my darkest, gloomiest days, the only thing that could lift my spirits is SALMON SASHIMI! And I definitely needed a good cheer-er upper. I decided to try Poke Express with the help of a friend referral (thanks Helen W!). 

First off, it is **LOCATED INSIDE ISLAND SUSHI** which is perfect because another friend of mine mentioned that Island Sushi was her favorite hole-in-the-wall sushi joint, and I've been wanting to check it out. So I went straight to the Poke bar and was seriously spell-bounded by this amazing concoction of chopped up sashimi. We don't have many Hawaiians in TX so this was pretty magical in my opinion. So many variations I had no clue what to do! Well I'm assuming I met the owner since he was referred to as 'Papa'. Let me just say, I might just repeatedly come back just to visit Papa. He was the sweetest man ever! He let me sample pretty much everything and got me full before I could even get to my order! If you're new to Poke like I am, it's basically chopped up cube-sized sashimi marinated in different variation of sauces. I saw a lot of variations of tuna, but also squid and shrimp choices. You order it by 1/2 lb, 1lb , and so on.

Of course I went for the salmon. I asked him to do whatever he wanted to it since I wasn't sure which sauce I would really prefer. Well easy enough the salmon already has it's own special sauce. I wanna say it's the Shoyu but not sure. He mixed it with green and yellow onions and sprinkled it with sesame seeds. LOVED IT. And the most important factor.. IT WAS EXTREMELY FRESH.

1/2 lb cost me about $7.55 & it was definitely a good portion for just one person.

LADIES AND GENTLEMAN I FOUND MY FAVORITE SUSHI PLACE IN VEGAS! 

*crowd roaring*"}
{"text":"Refreshingly the best poké I've found in Vegas. Kind of expensive, but good poke always is worth it. I like that they had many options for sides, and you can clearly see that the fish is fresh with no water or freezer damage. My ultimate favorite (spicy with kimchi base) had to be made to order so I waited around a few mins and looked around. There are no seats in the place.

There are also other small items like furikake and other seasonings on the side for purchase. I only wished they had soy sauce and a lemon wedge available on the side but they gave me shoyu sauce instead for $0.50. I'm spoiled by the good poke places back home I guess. I could make it myself but when I am short on time this is where I'll definitely return! I introduced my coworkers to this spot and now they love it."}
{"text":"Super Delicious! This is my new favorite Poke place and it's close to work which is a huge PLUS. 

PRO
-They have a variety of different kinds 
- Allow you sample them before buying
- Employees were happy and accommodating 
- Great overall environment (reminded me of Hawaii) 

My ONLY con is that there isn't a location near my house!"}
{"text":"06.15.2014

I knew the family wouldn't be eating much poke so I got a small 1/4 pound sample of the Ahi Furikake. SO ONO--FRESH and seasoned well!!!  Little \"O\" is definitely a mini me because she ate a few pieces with me. :) A perfect light pupu before our food from Island Grill. I hope we can come back and get some of the salmon poke (which the guy in front me took the last of)."}
{"text":"Fresh and local poke. Can't get enough of Hawaii. Nice portion six
Size from half pound to pound or which ever size you want. They also offer small selection of frozen and grocery items. Easy service. I like the smell of raw poke especially asking for a little sample to try. I usually get a lot when I have party's or when I crave."}
{"text":"Holy baby.. this is THE go to place for your poke fix.  I have also grew up in Hawai'i and this is the closest poke you are gonna find to Hawai'i poke in LV.  I took home a pound each of the shoyu poke, wasabi poke, and the spicy ahi poke and I had to restrain myself from not eating all three pounds on the way back home!  I wish this location was a lot closer to my house so I wouldn't have to drive so far to get my fix but, all in all, the drive is well worth it.  The prices were much better than other poke places, the fish is always fresh, and being able to speak \"pidgin\" to the staff was a very nice experience indeed.  If it wasn't so far from me I guarantee I would be here a lot more often than once every few months.  5 stars for price, taste, and experience."}
{"text":"This place is the go to spot when you have a craving for poke.  The tuna is very fresh and tastes delicious.  I get the classic Hawaiian poke and when I want the spice- I order the wasabi poke. Delish!  I come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Honestly, just a great family business. They make everyone feel so welcomed with their aloha spirit and it is my favorite  poke place in Vegas! Poke bowls are my favorite and it tastes so fresh!"}
{"text":"09.10.2017 @1pm 
We ordered 4 1/3 size bowls. Spicy avocado, wasabi, limu and salmon ponzu. 

Everything was fresh and tasty and totally it, We spent $24. The downside is there is no where to sit so you would have to order and take it home. In this case we ordered, went in the car and parked across the street haha. 

The spicy avocado is my favorite, it wasn't too spicy and you can taste the avocado. It didn't over power the flavor. 

The wasabi flavor is your typical burn your tongue for a quick second feel but it was not bad at all. 

Limu was basic for me. It has the red seaweed in it. 

Salmon ponzu was surprisingly nice and refreshing. I'm not a raw salmon eater but this was amazing and my favorite out of the 4.

3 stars because the customer service was not great. North side location will be the spot we go to from now on. 

We used a $20 and I guess the counterfeit  machine wasn't reading the bill, the girl behind the counter looked at the $20 used the pen and a black light to check the bill. She said it was fake. My friend paying said that's fine she'll use another $20. I looked at the bill and told her it was fine but I didn't want to be that person to say \"hey I work with money it's not fake\" so she used another bill. It was a little embarassing. As we walked out the girl was telling her co worker pretty loud saying if it's brown its fake. If its black or dark brown then question it. The bill mark was yellow-ish brown.

Aside from the embarrassment, the food is awesome. Truthfully, we'll drive north for our cravings next time."}
{"text":"Been eating at Poke Express for almost 10 years. From Craig Rd to Eastern to Stephanie. Always great. Salmon w Special Sauce and Furikake."}
{"text":"Amazing poke!!! Had the spicy avocado and the garlic ahi poke! Reminded me so much of the poke we would get in Hawaii! She even let us sample some so we could figure out what we wanted. Price is spot on.  We did the two pokes with rice, got a thing of soybeans, and 3 drinks and it came out to $21! Can't beat that! Can't wait to go back! Well worth the 6 hour drive from SLC."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers!  I never would have known about this fabulous place had it not been for you!  Poke Express is like stepping off the plane in Kauai and heading to my favorite poke place.  Totally fresh, delicious and a great assortment to choose from.  Generous samples offered to try before you buy.  Very friendly, knowledgeable staff.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place NEVER disappoints!! Must go-to spot right here! My favorite is the spicy ahi and imitation crab combo!! Soo yumm!! Everything here is fresh and the employees are super nice!! They do samples so don't be shame to ask!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in and the employees there were very helpful. They could tell i honestly was not sure what i wanted or what to look for so without me asking they let me several of the different fresh tuna and salmon options. They explained to me what goes well together as well. The poke bowl over all was very good, thank you!"}
{"text":"In Vegas? Go here!

These folks do poke like In-N-Out does burgers! AKA they know their ish! 

Located in the Eastern Promenade shopping center, Poke Express is a deli-style counter inside of Island Sushi & Grille. It's full of locals so you know it's good! The deli-side has about 8-10 small tables, so it can get pretty packed. You order poke by the pound, most averaging about $15.95/lb. 

We ordered the Ahi with Limu, Spicy Combo, Ahi Furikake, and Tako Poke. All four were really delicious and fresh! You can also order a side of rice to make the experience complete! 

The staff is really friendly and helpful. I felt like I was in HI! 

Gotta say, this is the best poke on the mainland! As a matter of fact, we stopped here one last time to pick up poke to-go for our drive back to Cali!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times over the past year. The quality of the Ahi Poke is consistently high quality, and the price is very reasonable. Also there are many varieties of poke to choose from. 

The service is quick and the owners are extremely nice and helpful. Store hours are 10:00am - 6:00pm, closed Wednesday. 

TAKE OUT ONLY."}
{"text":"This place is amazing....a tiny bit pricey, but you get what you pay for right?  The quality and freshness is outstanding, and the customer service is as good or better than any restaurant in Las Vegas.  I have had the poke, and some of the Hawaiian breakfast food, the malasadas are a must!  If you like fish, come get some poke, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"5 stars. Nuff said

....ok, I guess this wasn't a good enough review so let me elaborate. I'm from out of town and no matter where I am in Vegas I will come here during my visit and before I leave to grab some Poke. My favorite is the Spicy Ahi Poke but as I said before everything else is equally as good too. If you're local or from out of town, stop by and check it out...that is, if you're not afraid of raw seafood =)"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!!! Love the people, the food, the service!!!  I tried a poke in Chinatown (bla), I tried one in Cali ( eww), this is the best!   I recommend salmon light onions light sauce or tuna w avocado!  I only dream of a south east store for ease of access and more poke for me! God Bless!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was in Los Angeles!  Located in a strip mall, there's tons of easy parking.  Three restaurants in one place means you can get some sushi, poke, hawaiian, and yummy desserts too.  There are tables & chairs, and I think you can order grill items from the poke counter too.

We had lunch here before we hit the road to drive back home, & I literally did not need to eat til the next day.  (Ok, well except some of the leftovers haha)

Everything was GREAT:

Poke - sold by the weight, they had like a dozen different choices, as well as kimchi cucumbers, seaweed salad, and whole garlic cloves

Loco Moco - mmmm, fatty pork, short grain rice, runny eggs & a meaty gravy

Tres Leches cake with guava
Guava layer cake
Malasadas filled with custard, coconut or chocolate cream
Butter mochi

The sushi restaurant that's attached also does ayce.

In LA, there are a lot of great poke places, but I don't know where to get loco moco with slices of fatty pork instead of the hamburger.  So the next time I come here, I'd get the poke again, but the loco moco would be what I'd make the special trip for!"}
{"text":"The moment when I walk in and was greeted, \"Howzit Bruddah!\" Got me into the Aloha spirit that left me wanting to go and take a plane ride back to the Islands of Hawaii. The ambience of this place pretty much represent the culture found in Hawaii. It was nice to see other grinds(delicious food) that are dominant in many Hawaiian households being sold here along the large variety of Poke. By far the largest and freshest selection in the 9th island(Las Vegas) ever since my family moved here from Hawaii.

Simply everything that I've purchased was good and worth trying out. Some of my favorites were the Shoyu Ahi Poke and Hawaiian Style Poke. A few items that got my attention was the Lomilomi Salmon Salad, Hawaiian version of a fresh Salsa and  the Seaweed Salad. Both items were fresh and refreshing to the palate that complimented the Poke. ;)

Living in Hawaii, Poke is a staple and for some its an aquired taste. However, this place is a great way to get aquainted with the original way of enjoying Poke before this food item became an explosive craze that is sweeping the Nation. The staff here is very friendly and will accomadate your needs and explained what each item is.

- I recommend to go early in the day for the best selection. 
- This place is more of a grab and go.
- Don't forget to check out the various grocery items that are sold here.

To the staff at Poke Express: Mahalo nui loa!

{"text":"Great place for poke especially since there is not alot of them on the north side but customer service is excellent and free samples . . . . Also the business is in the corner first time I went to look for them I was lost in the shopping centre"}
{"text":"Delish! Great ahi tuna, kalua pig, teri beef and service! This little joint reminded me of Hawaii:)"}
{"text":"Soooooooo good but soooooooo far away from me! This place reminds me of home in Hawaii when I visit the local fish markets. The garlic shoyu is a winner, so ono! Every time I get a chance to make it out that way I pick up three pounds of poke, it goes fast in my house!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I hope they will open one in Southern California!  I got sweet chili mussels, spicy salmon and salmon with special sauce.   Salmon with special sauce was excellent with fresh salmon and perfect amount of white and green onion. The sauce is rather sweet, so I recommend you get it as a side.  This is the first time for me to have mussels poke, and it was delicious.  Spicy salmon was rather heavy and I couldn't taste salmon because of spice.  I also tried mussels with kimchi and didn't like it; it was too salty. 

It's a small place with no frills, but the staff was very helpful, and there are so many different flavors and fish I like to try.  I saw some meats poke (?) too.  

It's a bit away from where I frequent in LV, but I will make a trip to visit this place again.  A great job, owners!"}
{"text":"Poke Express has way better poke than most of the sushi burrito places offering tuna. There are a lot of flavours. My favourite is the spicy mayo. 

There is no seating, but that's why it's called the poke express. The faster I get home, the faster I can enjoy the poke!!"}
{"text":"A little poke deli. There are around 6 different kinds for $15.99/lb. They offer samples, which is great to taste before ordering. I got 3 flavors, 1/3 lb each to share as a snack. Doesn't look like a lot per container, but def filling. There are almost no poke delis in Seattle (where I'm from), so this place is pretty dang awesome to me! I'd come back if I was in town! Very reasonable pricing too!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Makes sure you try the poke before you pick to make sure you like it.  Poke is so fresh"}
{"text":"Drove by today and noticed this spot.  Got da Ahi Limu and cucumber kimchi.  The Ahi tasted fresh and yummy.  reminded me of home, gonna come here more often fosure."}
{"text":"After having ahi poke bowls in Hawaii last year, my husband and I have not been able to satisfy our poke bowl addiction...until a few days ago.  We decided to go on a \"poke adventure.\"  We jumped in the car and yelped on the road for poke.  What we found was a 5-star rated place, not far from our house.  

When we walked inside, I was a little intimidated by the smallness of the place.  But as we walked to the deli-style counter, we were quickly greeted by the friendly Hawaiian behind the counter and encouraged to try everything.  We tried the ahi poke limu (chili water) and chuka ii dako tako poke (looks like red baby octopus).  We bought both.  The only thing we would have liked was rice, like in Hawaii.  To solve that, we went to the 808 Hawaiian restaurant a few doors down.  

I love that we found this place and will definitely go back soon for some poke and Aloha!"}
{"text":"best service ever! I had never heard of poke before coming here, and was skeptical after finding out that poke consisted of raw fish. the man behind the counter let us try anything, which was really helpful. we tried wasabi, spicy avocado, hawaiian poke, which were all really good, even to this raw fish skeptic. the man was nice and let us know that we can eat our food at 808 in the same complex."}
{"text":"Poke Express is legit when it comes to refreshingly clean tasting poke. It's a small business, run by people who know Hawaiian flavors. They are friendly and even offer you samples prior to purchasing. You can order in half pound plastic containers and up. My favorite was the spicy wasabi ahi, while the shoyu ahi was a close second. For around $15, you could get a pound of a couple poke flavors for your next meal. Forget the buffets. It's a little bit out of the way from the Strip, but if you love fresh fish, this is the place."}
{"text":"Love this place because this is the closet to what I enjoy back home in Hawaii. It doesn't taste as fresh as Hawaii but it still good to me."}
{"text":"Went there for first time on a recommendation and it was yummy! Loved their spicy ahi and the avocado / ahi. Get a great two item plate with a good amount of sticky rice and you have two meals!  definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"When I first got here, I felt kind of awkward because I was the only person here. The person working was really nice. I asked what a popular one was and he just said \"I don't want to steer you to get something you don't like, so it would be better for you to try it.\" He was very concerned about me just trying something without knowing if I'll like it. I thought that was good customer service. 
They have a lot of different flavors, he let me have samples of everything so I knew what to get. I was getting food for my friend too and decided to get 1/4 of each flavor. Honestly, I don't remember everything but my 3 favorites are: shoyu, kimchi, and kimchi mussels.

The food: the food had a fresh taste. There wasn't too much sauce so you could really taste everything. I would definitely recommend this place and get multiple different flavors! It'll be like a fish buffet, can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"So, we found out that most of their poke is from the islands.  No wonder it taste so freakin' awesoooome!  It tasted like the real deal.  Worth every bit of a detour in Vegas if you're Hawaiian or if you just love eating poke.  They're in North Las Vegas though so it's impossible to get there without a car or forking out some cheddar for a taxi.  Thankfully, we had a car handy, but I wouldn't mind paying a taxi fare to go there though...yeah, it's that good!

The people at Poke Express are cool too.  They allow you to get some samples if you're unfamiliar with a certain item they sell.  The customer service at Poke Express is incredibly good.  True Hawaiian kind.  We left the young dude that helped us with a pretty good tip...it's Vegas baby, Vegas!  Gotta reward good customer service.

Anyways, check out my pics to see what I got.  I liked everything but my favorites are the Raw Crab Poke Kim Chee Style and the Wasabi Raw Tako.  You can't go wrong when you're there.  Just ask for a sample and let the poke take control of your senses.  Peace out, brothas and sistahs."}
{"text":"Happy I found this place ! 
Tips: Poke express is inside the Island restaurant. If you want poke go to the back counter display window and order there and if you want rice dishes then go to the front cashier. You can pay for it together in the front. They won't let you order poke from the front cashier. 

My favorite is the ahi furikake. If you want something cleaner tasting, try the salmon with special sauce. 
Garlic chicken with rice is also pretty good."}
{"text":"Pros:

1) The fish quality is excellent. Very fresh and tasty. The salmon poke is one of the best I've had.

2) They have various size containers, but it goes by the pound so you can get as much or as little as you like. We ordered at 1/3 pound of salmon poke, and another container that had about five cubes of tuna limu because I wanted to try it. Great way to sample multiple flavors, instead of committing to a pound of just one type.

Cons:

1) No rice or rice bowl option here. It's strictly fish by the pound. I'd rather have a Hawaiian-style bowl, as I have trouble eating a pound of pure fish with nothing else.

2) Hard to find. It's in the corner and the sign is hidden."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best place for fresh poke and great customer service. My favorite is their Spicy Ahi & Avocado poke and Garlic poke. If you're not sure or unfamiliar with a flavor, they will let you sample it. This place even sells a few Hawaiian items - Hawaiian Sun drinks, Shrimp Chips, etc. I gave 4 out of 5 stars because there is no place to sit or stand to enjoy your delicious poke! A counter with a couple bar stools in front could be a good idea since this place is tiny."}
{"text":"Fresh. Delicious. Reasonably priced. Friendly workers/owner. This will probably be one of our go-to places when we are in Vegas. I get why this place is so popular. It's a no-frills joint (no tables to sit and eat, all food served in plastic containers) but IMO, this is a plus since the money saved from not being a dine-in establishment translates to lower prices. The food is absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Hands down the best poke I've ever had!!  We recently moved to Henderson from Southern California where fresh fish is readily available so I was worried I wouldn't be able to find something out here I liked and wow was I pleasantly surprised!  Poke Express is the best I've ever had!!!!  I ordered 4 different varieties and can't wait to go back and try even more!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Best poke I've ever had. Every one I tried was stupid yummy and the seaweed salad almost brought tears to my eyes."}
{"text":"Oh yes. My favorite place for poke everything. The only thing is that to get to the ordering area you have to go to everyone who's already eating on the Hawaiian restaurant. 

After that, I decided to also learn how to do all their different types of poke. Mine don't comes out as theirs but it holds me until I can go there and eat 1# of their Salmon poke.

Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"To all my Vegas friends who don't mind driving a bit off the strip for some really good and fresh poke, come here!

It's a small family owned business with friendly service. The food is more for to-go and is fairly priced.

My friends and I tried the:
- Spicy Ahi Poke - So good with brown rice (which we bought separately next-door)! It's a bit heavier than the other poke since it's sauce is made out of mayoinasse & sriracha.
- Ahi w/ Oyster Sauce - I really liked this one! It had a bit of a Chinese spin on poke.
- Ahi Poke w/ Limu & Chili Flakes - If you like spicy poke, order this! It was quite good!
- Ahi Hawaiian Style - Very traditional poke if you want something solid.

TIP: they don't sell rice here with their poke but you can buy rice at Teriyaki Madness within the same plaza!"}
{"text":"So I was craving some ahi tuna one day went to try this place and it was awesome!!!!! I really recommend it to anyone that likes seafood it's hella bomb!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good poke, oxtail soup, Kalua pig, and a friendly staff that makes it feel like I'm amongst locals!"}
{"text":"I was headed to Terriyaki Madness to grab a quick lunch today and as I pulled into the parking lot, I saw Poke Express. I decided to give it a try since I love poke! I was not disappointed! The lady there was so sweet! She explained all the different flavors, let me try as many as I wanted to make sure I was happy with what I got! I have only ever had the traditional poke, so I was super excited to try all the different ones. I ended up going with sweet chili poke, spicy avocado poke, the traditional Hawaiian poke, a side of rice with furikake and some Kim chi cucumbers! I also tried the Kim chi mussels and they were really good! Look forward to going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Fresh poke (Hawaiian style sushi/fish salad typically consisting of seaweed, soy sauce, and other Hawaiian toppings) in Las Vegas, It Exists!

The line is looooong at closing time (think 25 mins) for a reason, so come earlier.

They have over 25 types of poke of all sorts of fish, in 5 varying sauces of all types  (limu, shoyu, ahi, spicy mayo, etc), and everyone likes different ones.

I tried a quarter pound of each (about $4 each and it was plenty) of these 4 popular ones:
limu ahi - too seaweedy for me
spicy ahi shoyu - level 7 spice is a bit too hot, even for a hot sauce fan like myself, get 4/5 I advise, but the flavor and soy sauce on ahi is great
Hawaiian ahi - wow, just wow. I could eat this for days. I could get $20 worth and poke like a king.
Salmon with special garlic sauce - amazing. It's like salmon sashimi, but better and fresher and more flavorful with the light toppings.

This place is awesome (it's about 15 miles north of the strip)."}
{"text":"Poke Express most definitely deserves a stop. We were getting tired of Aloha Specialties (shocking right?) so we ran a search through Yelp for another Hawaiian joint. They have 2 locations to serve the masses so chances are, you won't have to wait *ahem* Aloha Specialties *ahem*.

They have two sides to the restaurant, where one side is pay at the counter and the other is a sit down. Naturally, we stayed on the express side so we could satiate our ever growing appetites. Make sure you check out their poke selection. They'll let you sample everything. 

Poke -- We ordered the salmon and mussel poke. The salmon was chopped into small chunks and both were lightly flavored with soy sauce and chopped onions. What a simple concept yet so satisfying! All of the mussels were plump and juicy.

Saimin -- Order it with wontons! You won't be disappointed. Although Aloha Specialties makes the better version, Poke Express comes pretty darn close. They give you a ton of saimin, garnished with kamaboko and thinly-sliced spam. Their broth is very similar to Aloha. Simple and clean is how I would describe it. 

Spicy Ahi Bowl -- A nice layer of spicy tuna laid on a bed of white rice. It's dressed with spicy mayo, sliced cucumbers, and tortilla chips. A little too much spicy mayo for my liking but the tuna was delicious. They mashed up the tuna nicely but we did get some chunks here and there.

Poke Express is the perfect spot for people craving some delicious Hawaiian food with a time constraint.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"It's seriously a poke paradise, I just wished it was nearer to me though. Overall, place looked clean and the staff are okay, but my biggest thing are the seafood poke variety. So many choices and so far, I liked everything. Definitely will go back if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Today was the first time I bought poke at a store.  Until now, I only had poke when I ate out.  All three of the varieties I bought - wasabi ahi poke, garlic style shrimp poke, and kimchee style poke were excellent!  What a great dinner!!

The staff was very, very pleasant and the young woman who got my order gave me a garlic shrimp to try.  It convinced me to split my 1/2 pound shrimp order into two types.

The price is very reasonable.  Now if it wasn't so far from where I live, I'd stop more often.  Ever think of opening a Summerlin Poke Express?"}
{"text":"Ever since visiting Hawaii for the first time 3 years ago, i have fallen in love with everything Hawaii. The islands, culture, people, and especially the food. Living in Las Vegas we are lucky enough to have a wide array of Hawaiian restaurants. They don' t call us the 9th island for nothing i guess.

Poke Express is up among the top of my list. Located on Eastern. Prepare to take a nap if heading south and trying to make that left turn. Unbelievable how busy that street is. But located and adjoined to Island Style sushi which i haven't had the pleasure to try yet, but i will eventually. Poke express is more for Hawaiian favorites, a deli style case full of Poke, and a small case of tasty looking baked goods.

I have been here several times now, and give it 5 stars each time. The Poke section is one of the best i have seen. They have a good 15-20 different selections, made fresh daily. A lot of Tuna varieties, Salmon, and Tako. I like that they let you try samples before you buy. Most varieties run about $16 a pound and you can get the sauce right in the Poke or on the side. My wife absolutely loves the Poke here.

The Hawaiian specialties are all good. Big variety. Loco Moco, Ramen, Kalua Pig, etc. My little hobby has been to try everyone's loco moco. This version ranks right up there. They have a mini and a regular. Regular be prepared not to eat again till dinner. It's HUGE!! felt like 5 pounds i swear. The rice is cooked perfect, nicely done over-easy eggs, delicious juicy beef patty, and topped by very good rich brown gravy. My next time I would really like to try their bakery section. The guava cake looks delicious.

If you are looking for Hawaiian in Henderson, consider Poke express. delicious food all the way around. And it should be noted how extremely friendly and helpful the staff is. It makes your visit great. Aloha!"}
{"text":"For my Hawaii people: 
Brah, da buggah stay FRESH and `ono! 

Translation: Very fresh, very delicious poke!

That's probably all you need to know... Gogogogogogo~"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. 

Express indeed. 
Everything are premade and marinated. 

Reasonable pricing but average taste. 

5 stars here doesn't reflect how it is everywhere else. 

Poke wasn't as fresh as you'd like it to be but passable. 

I didn't rate it 3 stars because it'd be giving them too much credit."}
{"text":"They have the freshest poke. I usually order the tuna with avocado and the kimchi one. Also very tasty is their salmon poke. This is a special treat that everyone should try at least once in their lives!! FYI this is an order and take home to eat type of place. The service is awesome here as well!!"}
{"text":"Before I got out of the car, the husband reminded me (again) the meaning of self-control. That's exactly what I need when I go to Poke Express. It was hard but it (kinda) worked today..ha! They still had ahi and salmon sashimi when I went at 1135 am. Tough call but I walked out of there with a proud smile and  only 2 containers of poke and ocean salad. I will be back for more in the future (tomorrow) when the hubby is at work .

Btw, I love that they offer military discount."}
{"text":"This my first time ever trying poke out and I had an expectation of having a poke bowl but that's not the case. I was able to sample some of them and my favorite by far is the spicy mayo and the spicy avocado. I was disappointed though, they didn't have any more salmon and I'm a big salmon fanatic but I guess I just have to get them on a different time. However, they said you can call in and reserve if anything if you're coming in that same day so that's good. Overall I'd totally come back for a quick poke run."}
{"text":"Let's start this review by saying that I have to go out of my way to get here, but it's so wonderful that I am willing to do so.

I walked into the store and was very quickly greeted. I went to the counter and ordered the Spicy Avocado Poke and she asked me if it was a favorite of mine. I told her that I'd actually never been to the shop, so she quickly asked me if I'd like a sample. I tried it and decided it was definitely what I was going to order! She then told me to try a different type, that it was a little bit sweeter. The sweeter sample was also delicious! She asked me if I'd like to sample anything else, so I tried the salmon poke, and again, I was impressed.

The overall quality of the fish is very impressive and it is definitely something worth making my way to this location. They have a very large assortment of poke salad using all types of fish. Definitely worth a try!!! Only reason I'm rating this 4 stars instead of 5 is the prices are a tad bit on the pricey side, but they do pick from a high quality of fish, so it's a moot point. Give this place a try, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this YUMMY!  Poke Express is located on the left side of the store (the north end) and it's narrow.  But what I like to do is to go in and order malasadas right away then walk straight for my main target: poke!  

How do you put that accent over letters?  This isn't poke like in poking people on facebook, this is pO'ke like.. uhh Pokemon, blah I don't know but this is delicious!  I'll always walk away with 2 lbs of delicious poke when I come here.  The couple that runs this is so nice and humble, even with the long line the person behind the poke counter apologizes for the wait and thanks you for waiting.  

On this particular day, I ordered my tuna shoyu and another poke and ate some of it right there while watching the remainder of a basketball game.  I wasn't rushed to go, I wasn't asked to move on, I was asked if I wanted something to drink.  I said no but the people here are really friendly.  And not only that but the poke is delicious!  I had to tell the guys (newbs) behind me that the guy actually makes them fresh for you and the empty container you see doesn't mean it's sold out.  The portions are perfect, the taste is fresh, and this comes really close to the type of poke you find in Hawaii.  Perfect 5 star experience whenever I come in, don't be shy too - just walk in and ask anyone on the left side for some help and they'll be happy to guide you and let you taste some poke to help you choose!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  The employees have always been so friendly and helpful.  We loved the Chili Water Ahi but an employee told us about Kimchee Ahi and we were hooked!  So much flavor pops immediately from the bits of poke.  We just wish they served rice and had a little seating area (outdoor or in).  We usually go down just a few shops and get rice from 808 restaurant and eat the poke in the car!!!  YUMMMY!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Some of the Best Poke in town. I always get the Spicy Wasabi Mayo!!"}
{"text":"On one of my recent trips here to LV... I had to make the trip out to Poke Express to compare with my joint (Hawaiian Style Poke in Chinatown) to see which one is better....  This had great reviews as well so I was really excited!

Small tiny spot at the back of the store... could be hard to find but just ask the cashier in front and they will direct you right to it!

Overall, many flavors to choose from...

In the cold counter, you can pick your choices and even try some samples before you buy!

Got the spicy ahi and the flavor was good but it wasn't as tasty as Hawaiian style poke simply because it didn't have as much red onions and green onions in the mix... you'd be surprised that these little spices on the side truly makes a difference...

Service was good, but not as great as Hawaiian Style Poke.... 

Still expensive... but what do you expect for eating fresh sashimi?

When you are in the area, try them out!  But I think the winner between the battle of POKES in LV goes to Hawaiian Style Poke in Chinatown....  Don't fret Poke Express, you are not a bad choice by any means!  

Sort of healthy and Yum!"}
{"text":"Had to share these amazing specials this place offers. From 10-2, they have poke \"bowls\"! So fresh, has great prices. For the bowl with two fish, came out to about $12. Bowl with one fish is about $8."}
{"text":"I got the Ahi/Avo bowl with brown rice. Turned off by the fact that they charge 1.25 extra for brown rice to be used instead of white rice, even though it's healthier. (Sad truth unfortunately about most places). I've had better cuts of poke. Some bites were a bit tough to chew. Flavor was great, all ingredients worked well together. I'd order from them again. I wish it wasn't so hidden though. I almost gave up my search but decided to contact a friend who let me know that no signs were outside & that it was located inside of Island Sushi."}
{"text":"POKE EXPRESS WOW! I never make it out to the north side of town and this place has been on my list for YEARS! Wow was I impressed. 

Poke express is a small Hawaiian Poke take out joint that also carries lots of Goodies from the islands like Portuguese sausage, mochi, and different frozen or pantry groceries. Poke is basically a sea protein that's normally raw, cut into bite sized pieces, and tossed in marinade that you eat raw.

Upon my arrival I was overwhelmed at the sheer variety and abundance of poke! They had imitation crab, tuna, salmon, mussels, and octopus from what I remembered. They also had a variety of sauces that were sweet, soy based, spicy, or creamy.

I literally sampled everything which made it even harder to choose! Let me tell you too they are all unique tasting! I was informed or maybe misheard that the joint can make the poke any way you want by choosing different cuts of fish for the sauce you want. 

The poke is sold in plastic containers which are weighed. You can get quarter lbs, half lbs, or full lbs. I suggest getting a variety of half lbs to share. The prices run from like $4.99-$14.99 a Lb I believe on the different products.

I know you're looking for suggestions, but they were all delicious. TRULY! I specifically LOVED both the octopus and mussel varieties they offered. Also the marinated imitation crab they carry is delicious! 

I let them know I'd be traveling at least 30 minutes to get home and they put my poke on ice! It was in the 80's in Vegas that day and that was just over the top special to me.

I had two scoops of rice with furikake and had a delicious lunch.

The shop has perfected what they do. This poke is a million times better than the little poke bowl places that are popping up. It is truly a local gem that everyone should try.

They take cash and card, the service is great, and the quality and taste of their products is just awesome.

10 out of 10 would return and recommend!"}
{"text":"Great selection and very helpful staff. I highly suggest you go there Thursdays and Fridays before the Poi is SOLD-OUT!! My personal favs are the Imitation Crab Combo and Ahi Poke with Oyster Sauce. It's an amazing gem that gives me a taste of home in Hawai'i."}
{"text":"My current obsession is the salmon poke from Poke Express. It's melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. The ahi shoyu poke is a close runner up, sometimes I go full-glutton mode and order a small container of each! 

Poke Express is simply a counter in the back of Island Sushi and Grill, which is located in a rather plain strip mall on Eastern. There is no signage outside, which can make finding Poke Express confusing for first timers. 

Every time I have gone to Poke Express there has been a line of people waiting to order poke to go. The employees keep the line moving fairly quickly  and I have always gotten great service. 

Poke is sold by the pound and based on the current market price, typically around $15/pound. When they run out, they run out so get there early in the day for the best selection."}
{"text":"Dear Darren & Team Poke Express,
     Cheers!!  Congratulations on opening another location.  Congrats on another 5 Star Yelp Average.  I'm in agreement with almost all the Yelpers I know.  Poke Express is the best in Las Vegas.  You're 2nd to None!!  You deserve all the praise.  If you noticed in the last year, a lot of poke bowl places opened their doors.  Yes, they're \"Hot and New\".  And yes, they get a lot of traffic and hype.  I've tried a few of them and they're good, just not Poke Express good.  In fact, it wouldn't even be fair to compare them to you because they just don't measure up.  

Quality Poke?  You got this!  I don't have a favorite.  I tend to mix it up on every visit.  
Great service?  You got that too. Thank your team for always treating me well.  

I'm at your OG location often and so glad this location is just as awesome.  You are my last review for 2016.  I saved the best for last.  Okay, Poke. It's time to go. Thank you and have a Happy New Year.  


-Mel C

Tips for Yelpers:  
-Undecided?  They offer samples.  You can't go wrong with any of their poke. 
-The Spicy Mayo is addicting.  Get a spoon so you don't miss a spot.  


Yelp Review #1000"}
{"text":"Freshest poke I've had in Las Vegas!   

No reason to go into too much detail about Poke Express since it's been done with all these reviews on here. If you love fresh poke and never been to Poke Express, then you're missing out.  All the 5 star reviews for Poke Express isn't hype.  If you crave fresh \"as good as it gets\" poke, then Poke Express needs to be on your list. 

My Favorites:
-Spicy Salmon:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=boCExakbpzFzpWRfuTFuZA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

-Ahi Poke w/Chili Water:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hUDI7snJJ5DGwl7YO8239Q&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

Tips:
-Don't expect a dining area here.  You can enjoy your poke standing inside, grubbin' in your car, as take out, or do what I do from time to time...I take it to Teriyaki Madness next door and eat it with a bowl of brown rice. 

-Expect to meet the nicest owners.  It's been a long time since my previous visit and they still treated me like they know me.  They definitely know their regulars by name. 


YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (054/366)"}
{"text":"Best poke I've found in Las Vegas. This is one of my favorite places and stop in whenever I'm near this side of town. Their spicy tuna is delicious and everything they make is made fresh daily. I love their mochiko chicken. And I always take fresh malassadas home. If you have never been to poke express/island sushi you must try it. I've been in love with this place for more than 4 years and the food is always great."}
{"text":"The 9th island comes to my rescue again. Outstanding poke.  The owner is great to visit and discuss poke, deep sea fishing, and the finer aspects of what make his poke so good. 

Good food like this is not cheap, but you only have so many meals in this life so why not make them worth while? 

This is something I look forward to once a week. Can't wait for one to open in Summerlin! Please!"}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD! There's no dine in area as everyone else has said, but that's ok, you can just eat it at the stop lights on your way home and tell your family they were closed - because nobody wants to share their poke express.

The staff is wonderful, they let you try something if you aren't sure you will like it, and they even have a small table where you can leave your own business cards (but only with a holder!)"}
{"text":"I was a little bit confused when I first parked at the lot since the spot was shared with a Hawaiian Restaurant. They have a wide variety of poke though & I was filled with happiness once I made eye contact with all of the flavors of poke. I forgot the names of what I ordered since I am typing up this review based on my experience back in June, but all I know was I died &went to poke heaven. I could NEVER get fresh poke like what Poke Express have back here in San Diego. The flavors were delicious, &I could not wait to be back here on my next visit in Vegas.

My bf ordered from the Hawaiian Restaurant, &their food was not good. L&Ls can make better food & L&Ls isnt even that good. lol. Their malasadas were SO GOOD though! I got 3 with custard filling & 3 regular, then I ordered more to take back to SD. They were hot &fresh!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff amazing poke. Reminded me of a poke stop in Hawaii but even better. If they were out of it they had no problem making more. Very very friendly staff. Wouldn't expect anything less from Hawaii let a lone a 5 star poke stop.  

Thanks guys. I'll be back for more for sure"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, I have been getting my poke from these guys since they were in Island Sushi.  They are always very friendly and helpful. The poke is always fresh and there is such a great variety, favorites include the salmon poke with special sauce, wasabi poke, shoyu poke, furikake poke, spicy mix....etc. It goes on and on. Now that they are in their own space, they started serving rice as well and have poke bowls. They also have a small section of snacks and a couple of freezers with goodies from Hawaii. Check them out for all your poke cravings."}
{"text":"First word that comes to mind is: FRESH.

Definitely good, fresh, HAWAIIAN-STYLE POKE here.  Not all like all that haole-fied stuff that's been popping up all over the place.  Everything is sold by the pound here, even the poke bowl (which was odd to me).  The selection is tremendous... comparable to places in Hawaii.  Prices were decent for Las Vegas.

Two small gripes.  1) Place does not have anyplace to eat.  I ate in my car in the parking lot.  2) Like most places, they use the skinny limu, and very little of it in the poke.  Is the fat limu hard to get here in landlocked Nevada?

Other than my two manini gripes above, love the poke here.  Very good.  Very fresh.  Great find in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Really great poke!

I dislike like poke spots that over sauce the fish, but it's perfect here!

The guys behind the counter are so nice. 

Super fresh fish+ great taste 

We got salmon poke, tako (octopus) with limo?, octopus with wasabi, and ahi tuna Hawaiian style. 

Def recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"It seems that I have inexplicably done my best to avoid trying Poke Express. I couldn't resist any longer, subconsciously or otherwise, when my friend brought a fine selection of their poke to football night.

There were four items. The spicy avocado ahi was delicious even though I personally couldn't handle the burning sensation after a while. Luckily, the heat didn't linger. The furikake ahi was more pleasant in my mouth, and it had the more typical onion and cucumber mixed in rather than the avocado.

Next, I had the kimchee crab, which also surprised me with heat, but I loved the tender crab more than enough to tooth my way through several pieces. Finally, I tried the kimchee mussel and eagerly went back for more. Not as spicy, but about as relatively tender as the crab. Mussel fans should definitely try this.

I was so happy with the poke that it didn't seem right not to weigh in immediately. I'll have to go some time and grab a couple of orders of poke for myself, and perhaps snap a few photos too."}
{"text":"Poke Express is seriously a gem that I am so glad I discovered while we were in Vegas.  At first, I was a bit skeptical to try it because how could there be fresh poke out in the hot ass desert?? BUT I decided to put my faith in Yelp and went to check it out anyway and I was glad I did.  All the poke selections average about $15/lb, but you can order by the half pound and quarter pound as well.  Mikah (?) and all the workers were very sweet and helpful.  They offered samples and gave us their opinions when we were unsure of which ones to order.  I ended up getting a half pound of their salmon and a half pound of their spicy combo.  If you get the salmon, be sure to ask for their special sauce.  It looks so simple, but oh so good! Don't skimp out on the onions either ;)  Their spicy combo is a mix of spicy mayo, tuna, imitation crab, cucumbers, and avocado.  This one was also good, but a little too rich after awhile because it had a too much spicy mayo for my liking.  Another thing I love about this little shop is that they also carry various Hawaiian specialty items such as soy sauce, drinks, pancake mixes, candy, etc.  I would say the only con about this place would be that there is nowhere to eat.  We were so hungry so we just ate outside on the steps, but there is a park across the street or you can wait for one of the surrounding restaurants to open."}
{"text":"If you dont know what \"poke\" is.. you better ask somebody..
This is always my last stop before we head back to California. 
If you're from the islands.. this is the place to get some local style poke. They have everything from lomi salmon to ahi and tako poke. I wish they had a location in cali..."}
{"text":"What already hasn't been said about Poke Express? Their poke is the best in town.

Walking in, the establishment is pretty small and honestly there is nothing special that will catch your eye. But that's the great part! There are no gimmicks to this place, but people still keep coming. Why? Because of the amazing quality they bring.

I was a fan of the location in North Las Vegas because it was so close to where I lived. Now that I moved across town, I was so happy to see there was another location nearby so I don't have to make the long drive back to North Town to fix my poke cravings!

You can sample any of the poke they have available. I would tell you which to try, but they're all amazing. You can tell that whoever makes them really focus on the quality they give to their customers. I've been here multiple times in all three of their locations and can't compare them because they all bring amazing food, attentive workers, good pricing, and a great experience. My favorite time is before 2PM when they have poke bowls available. Nothing special about these: just your choice of poke with rice and furikake on top (however, you can opt for brown rice or ocean salad for an extra charge!).

If you haven't come here, find the location nearest to you and make it a point to go try it out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been here! I've only had Poke at 2 other places in Vegas, but this is BY FAR the freshest of the 3. Not to mention there are a ton of different flavor options. Yum yum yum! Now come to Summerlin"}
{"text":"As others have said, get there early.

I drove up there on Saturday about 4 PM, and they were out of ahi--all types.

I got tako poke with limu, taegu (semi-dried thin sticks of cod--like a soft sweet jerky. goes great with rice), and shiba zuke (a type of pickled cucumber).

I really enjoyed them, though the onion in the poke was a bit strong.

Next time I hope I can get there early enough to get some ahi."}
{"text":"I always go here when I am craving poke!! Everything is always super fresh and amazing flavors. I always get hawaiian poke but today I had spicy ahi combo and it blew my taste buds away! Besides that all of my local cravings cone sushi, taco poke, imitation crab salad are always so ono. 

With awesome owner and staff....you have to come get your fix. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Always stop at this location when I'm in the area. Can't really comment on service because every time I've been there has been a line attest 5-6 people deep so you can tell they are trying to get it down quick leaving no room for a personalized experience. But I'm ok with that because I get in, get what I want and go! Poke is always fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this AMAZING place isn't everywhere?! Fresh food. Friendly services. Cheap prices. I don't know what else could be wrong about this place. Well I guess maybe if you don't like raw fish. 
I came here with my friends seeing all these five star reviews. They're not lying. This place deserves its 5 stars. They're willing to let you taste sample the different variety of fresh seafood they have and they give you two pieces at a time. The price is based on weight. My friend ordered a crab salad or something and she only paid $4 for it. They also have military discounts. But the prices are fairly reasonable and I don't mind it at all. I couldn't even finish my food because there was so much and I paid $12 for it. 
I wish this place was in my hometown. I think I'd get fat from eating there every other day."}
{"text":"POKE HEAVEN! Great selection of poke! There is so many different types of poke to choose from and they let you sample as well. There's salmon, ahi tuna, tako and even raw crab! 

This place north of the strip and is about a 15 minute drive from Downtown Las Vegas. 

Will def be returning."}
{"text":"Poke was delicious (regular Ahi with soy sauce) and I found it to be a fair price.  3/4 lb was a perfect size for dinner.  Will be going back to check out the other types they offer, the spicy mayo ahi looked good."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I am even more impressed with the freshness and taste of poke here than I was by some of the restaurants in Maui that we ate at when we were there in February. 

It was my first time here - one of my husband's coworkers recommended it to him and since he doesn't tend to eat much seafood, it has just remained on the backburner for several months. BIG MISTAKE!! I could have had so much more poke goodness by now.  

We were assisted by Brandon, who was absolutely spectacular. He let me try several samples, and even managed to get my hubby to try 3-4 different things when I said he doesn't eat seafood! He promised to start him off with the easy stuff and did just that. I was shocked by how well my hubby received everything - he even ended up picking up a couple of items!

We ended up getting spicy salmon poke, ahi poke with shoyu, tako with shoyu, idako tako poke (omg yum) and shiba zuke (seasoned cucumber). I am so looking forward to my next 2-3 meals. Yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"Poke Express is kinda far away for those visiting Las Vegas but its well worth the trip to try a cuisine that is extremely hard to find. THe people that work there have a ton of pride about what they do and the high quality of the products. FOr first timers, they will let you try any flavors and thats a huge plus. Poke Express is also immaculately clean. This is a rare culinary experience, try all the flavors of poke, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. There comes a point when a business shouldn't have a dollar sign attached to everything. I ordered a poke bowl and just asked if they can make it spicy. They said no sorry we don't. I said oh ok no problem. Then the lady says you can buy a side of sriracha for 75 cents. What???!!!! I didn't know there was such a thing as an island place charging for sriracha? I should of asked if they charge for soy sauce, but then maybe they might just say yes since I'm asking. How is it that every single island place that I've ever seen has sriracha just sitting there? Did I miss the big newscast about the shortage of sriracha? Never again. Never island sushi either. I even go to poke express up north. Never again. Silly of you guys. Yea 75 cents is small change, but there is a principle here. It's just like I wouldn't pay for ketchup at a burger place. Pathetic. Can't wait to let everyone know."}
{"text":"In case you were wondering, this place is a market, not restaurant. There's no seating inside. However, if you want to get lunch here and don't live nearby (like myself), there's a nice park across the street.

Since it's a market there are a few other things aside from just poke, but I went specifically to try the poke. You buy by the weight in containers at between $10 and $15 per lb. I decided to do several 1/4lb containers to try a few different ones. 

All of the fish is really fresh tasting, and the different mixtures like kimchee shrimp or salmon poke were so delicious. The only one I had that didn't wow me was the imitation crab salad. It was still good, but a bit heavy on the mayo and pepper for my liking.

I can't wait to come back and try a few different ones. I'm hoping they are willing to make some new ones. I had an idea for a kimchi salmon one that I didn't see in their case."}
{"text":"You cannot get better poke than Poke Express. This is our go-to when we want fresh poke and friendly service, like back home in Hawaii. If you haven't been here, go already....you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of different poke from different places and coming from Hawaii, I've had some bomb, fresh poke. With that said, the competition between the poke I've had back home and Poke Express is tight. For being in a location where we don't have the option of getting \"fresh\" fish, the freshness of the poke here is unbelievable. I come here often for tako and ahi poke and it never disappoints. The color and taste of the ahi is like something you would get back home. I'm lucky enough to work near the location because they seriously offer THE BEST poke in town. I must say, Poke Express is giving the businesses back home a run for their money.

Everything I've had from here is super delicious and no joke, the kim chee tako here is better than anywhere else I've ever had it. I have never been disappointed with anything I've eaten and I have tried a variety of different poke from here. To be honest, I can't really recommend anything because I seriously cannot decide what I like the most but to give you an idea - kim chee tako, ahi or crab, Hawaiian style poke, limu and shoyu tako, garlic ahi, etc.

The service here is always pleasant and everyone will give off that feeling of aloha. The deli case is packed with all kinds of seafood ranging from ahi, tako, shrimp, mussels and crab that you order by weight - mostly offering different varieties of tako and ahi. The store itself offered some local products that you may not be able to find anywhere else in Vegas which makes it even more of a plus!

*If you saw in my video that half the fridge was empty is because I go towards the ending of the day and at that time they don't put out all the poke but they are more than happy to make you a fresh order of whatever you want."}
{"text":"Amazing little gem! A little tough to find but well worth the effort!!! This place has a great selection of Poke, sides (such as seaweed salad) as well as a small section of Hawaiian goods you can't normally find in the grocery. The staff have been super friendly as well as helpful. Next to Da Poke Shack in Kona, this place is my favorite place to get fresh Poke...so much so that I'm willing to drive from Summerlin to pick up a few pounds of this delicious food. 
Thus far, I've had the Spicy Avocado Poke, Tako Poke KimChee style, Ahi Poke KimChee style, Ahi Poke with Oyster Sauce, and Tako Poke Limu....this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! The selection of poke and other salads is vast and everything is fresh as can be. With 90% of their product being seafood, Poke Express has virtually no smell inside. That's a great sign! They suggest that you taste what you are interested in buying and are happy to let you taste as many different pokes as you want. I opted for the lunch/bowl deal that lets you pick one or two pokes with a scoop of rice. The salmon poke and ahi limu poke were my choices and both are yummy!! The ahi limu is traditional and has an umami quality to it, while the salmon poke was a nice creamy texture, if that makes sense. The salmon poke also comes with a sauce to drizzle if you desire, it's good both with and without it! This was a great visit with more to come!!"}
{"text":"Comparing to some phenomenal Poke at top restaurants, Hawaii, and southern California I'd say \"I'm a fan\" but I wouldn't say it's as good.  Pricing was fair.

This place is a dive though that's about 100 degrees and just has a dirty, greasy feel.  

I would definitely take out but would never dine here again."}
{"text":"Ever since I've tried to eat healthier I decided to try and put fish in my diet more often versus meats and junk and what not. I see this shop when I go to Big Lots and have always wondered what they actually sell. So long story short I visited them on a Sunday and thank heavens I was the only one in the store buying that day. 

So lots of things to choose from. I didn't know where to start. It was nice that the guys had me try stuff before I bought anything. And they explained very well how you buy their products which is by the pound whether it be half, thirds, a whole pound, or two pounds. Prices are a bit high but you can't beat the freshness of the fish. Even if the stuff on display is almost out they can still make you a fresh batch. I liked the Marlin Poké particularly and the Ahi Shoyu. I loved it so much that I had to buy three pounds of each just to keep for myself (selfish but that just how good their stuff is). They recommend you eat it with rice to truly savor the food but they don't sell any. Thankfully they have a store a few doors down belonging to the same family that can sell you rice and even sit down and eat the fish you bought from the Poke store. 

I'll be a frequent customer of this store even if I'll be moving to Summerlin in the summer. I've always been fan of dishes with raw fish and Poke Express satisfies my cravings enough for me to splurge so much everytime I come to the store. I highly suggest giving them a visit when you have that craving for sushi but don't quite want to go to Spring Mountain and stand in line. 

The only thing bad about the store is that they close way too early. I usually have the cravings around dinner time and they close at 6pm. But other than that they're open seven days a week. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I've been missing out on this place for so long! Haven't had poke like this since I went to Hawaii, like 8 years ago.

This place is set up deli-style so don't plan on eating here! There aren't any tables or chairs. They also sell hawaiian snacks! 

We ordered Spicy Ahi Poke with Mayo + Masago, Spicy Wasabi, Garlic Poke, Lomi Lomi Salmon, Ocean Salad & Kimchi mussels. Everything was so flavorful. The spicy ahi and kimchi mussels were definitely my favorite. 

The service was great! Everyone was super friendly and do their best to make sure their customers aren't waiting forever, even when the line is really long.

The only downside I'd say is their hours. I usually get of at 6, which is the time they close. Wish they were open a little later. :("}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of poke/poke bowls since I moved to LV. Some places have come close to the flavors of Hawaii, but you can't get any better than this place. Everything here is good, and the prices are not much more than buying poke back home in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Best poke in Vegas!!! Me and the wife was so happy that they have this location.  I used to drive to the north location and we lived at the very south of  Vegas. Favorite thing to get is the spicy ahi poke.  We usually get 2lbs spicy ahi poke, 1lbs shoyu poke, 1lbs wasabi.  The fish is always fresh and tasty.

They have a special on Monday and Tuesday, if you buy 2lbs or more its $9.99/lb. Regular price per pound is $10.49."}
{"text":"I'm soooo glad I found this place. It absolutely takes me back to Hawaii. Went with a Hawaiian friend here because we just couldn't pass up a poke place when we saw that Vegas has one. I loved all the poke selections. I got to sample some of the flavors before picking my wasabi/avocado poke and the salmon poke. My friend had the spicy mayo poke. All were amazing!!!! We honestly wanted to stay there all day and just keep eating. I am definitely coming here EVERYTIME I'm in vegas!!"}
{"text":"Great Poke.  Makes me feel like I am Kailua. The fish is as fresh as it is in Hawaii. No place to sit and eat.  No rice somedays."}
{"text":"Wait, what? The best poke shop in Vegas is now on Stephanie in Henderson?! Poke Express is the same amazing poke shop you've probably already had inside Island Grill on Eastern. With the change in location and (finally!) their own place the Poke spot is more convenient and will finally get the attention they deserve. 
If you haven't had poke before, it is all raw fish. Order it by the pound and order a side of rice (you can even get furikake on the rice on request!) I find a 1/2 pound order with one order of rice to be a pretty filling portion for lunch. At just over $8, it's a great deal. I've had the shoyu poke, oyster sauce poke and the spicy tuna combo. Don't let the word spicy turn you away- I'm a weakling when it comes to spiciness, but I was more than okay with it! The restaurant also sells your usual Hawaiian shop frozen foods (bao, gyoza), drinks (Hawaiian Sun, Arizona teas) and Asian sauces (Yoshida sauce!!!!!!) There are no seats inside the restaurant so take it to go! But don't worry, poke doesn't have a strong fishy scent so you'll still be able to eat it at work ;)"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with this place. I've yet to eat at the restaurant but the ahi bar is amazing! I always come in to get the spicy ahi bowl and a few sides of ahi. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Every great review you read is true.  Just go! This place lives up to the hype.  Consistently.

My tip.......... go just before closing time when all that was prepared for the day is gone.  You can still order any flavor, it's just cut and sauced up right then and there.  Fish is more firm and sauce pops a little more, in my opinion."}
{"text":"We found this on a whim while exploring off the strip one day, and it's some of the best poke I've had. Now, every time we visit Vegas, we stop here. It's not too far of a jaunt off the freeway, and it's well worth it. 

My favorites are the spicy avocado and the spicy ahi, but we've tried quite a few, and they all win.

Next time, we are going to bring a cooler to take some back to CA with us! Haha."}
{"text":"Best Poke shop in Vegas. Feels like home walking through those doors. Everything is good. It's the \"Tanioka's\" of Vegas."}
{"text":"Yes this is the same poke express that was inside island sushi. Yes it is still great quality fish with several options of poke style. Yes they do bowls here which make a nice clean meal especially after a heavy gym session.  

Each poke is priced per pound and I find it reasonable especially since the quality is wonderful. This Plaza only had a teriyaki madness and definitely needed this to give the area more foodie pizazz

Definitely one of my favorite poke bowl places alongside to see roll!"}
{"text":"malasadas, bento box, squid, ramen...if you can grab a table, then you're doing well."}
{"text":"Just like the location in North Las Vegas (my review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/poke-express-north-las-vegas?hrid=-7OW5a9-2Mp9TiP4NGzZ5g ), Poke Express serves some of the freshest and most flavorful poke you'll have on the mainland. The fact that you can get it in the middle of the desert is nothing short of a miracle.

This Poke Express shares space with Island Sushi & Grill; when you enter, the grill/kitchen is to your left, the sushi restaurant is to your right, and Poke Express is the refrigerated cases straight back. Like their other storefront, the service is spectacular and you can sample to your heart's content. You won't be sampling long, though, since you'll want to devour a pound of that magical fish ASAP. Order and pay immediately or you can add it to your order from the grill. 

Although the selection isn't quite as large as the North Las Vegas market, this PE offers a place to sit down to scarf down the poke and the bonus of Island Sushi & Grill's Hawaiian menu. In addition to our poke, we also shared a salmon skin bowl (yum!) and took a dozen malasadas back to our hotel to share with our family. 

My wife and I like to keep things simple at PE: we made two trips here last time and ordered one half-pound of the Furukake poke and a third-pound of a few others (shoyu; ahi with limu) and an order of steamed rice. It's like making your own high-quality chirashi bowl for a fraction of the price of what you'd pay at a hotel or a restaurant.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My Yelp buddies deserve all the credit for pointing me and my wife in the right direction for a terrific lunch in North Las Vegas. Poke Express is a no-frills eatery; actually, it's more of a market with a few shelves of food products and two refrigerated cases of their sublime poke. Although traditionally served raw, there are many varieties of poke offered here: on your left are the cooked and on your right are the uncooked versions. These include different types of seafood, but I still prefer the standard tuna.  

What makes Poke Express five-star worthy is not only the seafood, but the stellar service. Our server was thoughtful and friendly, and he encouraged us to try the various poki while explaining each. Even after a few samples he persuaded us to try others and we happily obliged. Finally, we settled on two uncooked selections: the poke with oyster sauce and the spicy ahi poke. Both were amazing: the tuna in each was fresh, meaty, and flavorful. We enjoyed each one, but gave a slight nod to the spicy ahi poke, with the spicy sauce being an excellent blend of heat and flavor. 

You pay by the pound here, with most in the $14.99/lb range, and they have plastic containers to show how much you'll receive. For our two half-pounds, the final total was just over $15 with tax. Again, nothing fancy, just our containers of fresh and delectable poke (and two pairs of chopsticks). My wife and I could not wait to eat our lunch, and we devoured both containers in the car, A/C keeping us cool as we stuffed ourselves to the gills."}
{"text":"The poke here is amazing! It's been my to go to place every time I visit vegas. I love the freshness of all the poke they offer and they offer a lot of different varieties. My favorite is the salmon poke, ahi furikake poke, and spicy ahi masago and mayo. The prices are more than fair considering the quality."}
{"text":"The very best! Cant go wrong fresh fish all the time!! Spicy ahi is the bomb! I come to this place to satisfy my sushi cravings and it does more then hit the spot. Employees are super friendly. The place can get a little packed around lunch time. Since this place is so good!"}
{"text":"First time here and wasn't disappointed. Got a Poke Bowl with Salmon and Spicy Ahi, 2 scoops of rice. So filling and so good. Flavor is on point, and they staff was really nice and very helpful to me since I never been there and needed help. I was even able to sample a few. Totally worth it. $8.00 lunch!"}
{"text":"Feeling Nostalgic for Hawaiian foods while you are in Vegas? Head over to one of the two locations of Poke express and peruse their menu offerings which range from poke to Dobash cake and malasadas.   

Located inside/adjacent to island sushi you walk through darkly filmed doors into a store type setup and to your left is the dessert case, to the right is the restaurant, and straight back are the trays of the poke. 

Dessert selection reminded me of the offerings at Kings Hawaiian Bakery. The whole cakes start at $25 and slices will run you about $5.50. Selections include Dobash, Haupia and Guava cakes.

The Malasada doughnuts at $1.20 each are large and filled to order. The filling options are chocolate, custard and Haupia. The Haupia filling was coconutty n creamy but not too heavy.

They are no longer offering 1/4 lb for poke as smallest size..now 1/3 is smallest avail and I paid about $5.42 for my 1/4lb of furikake poke. My poke was seasoned with what they described as dry seaweed. I preferred it to the Limu which contains fresh seaweed.  The poke contained big chunks of Ahi. The fish was firm and creamy  with a nice clean taste. Love this friendly little spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh poke with a good selection! Friendly, caring service. There are also a lot of other goodies you can get from Hawaii too and they have Samurai Ice Cream!!! Yummmm!"}
{"text":"I recently got back from Waikiki & immediately went on a search for poke in Vegas. Thankfully this place wasn't too far away. 
To be honest, I think I was mainly in denial about being back home so I wanted a piece of Hawaii with me.  Good news & bad news about this place. 
First, for the bad: Unfortunately, they're not as friendly as the spots in Hawaii so that immediately took away from some excitement. 
Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about the good: they had an assortment of Hawaiian products that you don't find everywhere. Although there wasn't anything much different from what you'll fun at other spots that sale Hawaiian goods. 
The poke was pretty good. Of course I wasn't expecting as fresh tasting as on the island (for we are in a desert) but from what they have to work with.. It was delish!

They had a pretty big assortment of items but like I said.. It wasn't the most welcoming environment so I didn't ask to taste much while i was there. So I got a garlic poke and a regular and was off. I do wish that I would've tried something else but I'm a VERY picky eater so it's probably best that I didn't. lol All in all... I give them 3 stars. Mostly because of the service I received on that particular day at that particular time. I'll go back another day & see if it changes (for everyone has bad days)! :)"}
{"text":"The poke here is yummie and it hits the spot. It's hard to give 5 stars only cause I am a little bias. I'm used to eating fresh poke every time I visit Hawaii. 

This place is the best option for poke in Vegas area! Good thing I live close. 

Thursdays they have poi too! :)"}
{"text":"So I went for the first time today with my husband and son.... I was very pleased! The moment I walked in... We were greeted and was asked if we needed any help... I had let them know that it was out first time... They were more than happy to let us sample almost everything and the atmosphere felt like home... Okay so after trying basically everything I decided to go for the chili water ahi.... YUM! The quality is very fresh and oooo so good... My only downfall is that I wish I knew about this place when I first moved here years ago! The ocean salad is yummy also! I was surprised that they had kimchee marinated raw crab... This was one of the foods that I ate being brought up as a kid and oh did it bring back great memories! I am soo glad that I decided to go and try this place out! This is now my favorite place to go and living close by is such a plus! I would def have all my friends and family come here for some good fresh food! Good Poke! Great job! This place is a keeper!"}
{"text":"It's basically a store front, there's no seating, but they seem to love offering you samples. 
Great for sushi parties, and if you've never had one, throw one, they're awesome!"}
{"text":"So damn good! Coming from the East Coast, I had no idea what Poke was and I never knew how much I love it until visiting Poke Express. The fish is always fresh and things that are not on display can be made to order (except salmon poke, I think). You can also get rice before 2pm, Spicy Ahi is AMAZING over rice. I also love their seaweed salad and Inari filled with imitation crab. The Spicy Avocado is one of my favorites too. I don't think there is anything here that wasn't good! EVER!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Haleiwa and was worried about Poke withdrawals. Well, thanks to Poke Express, all my worrying was for naught. Outstanding!!!  I will probably be customer of the year. A big mahalo to this establishment that makes the best poke east of Hawaii. YUMMY!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here to try the poke. I got the special where you choose 2 poke and order of white rice with the toppings on the rice. They let you sample it before you buy. I really love the spicy ahi sauce but I got the sauce with salmon instead of tuna. You can ask them to do that. Then I got 1/3 pound of Kimchi cucumbers and my other side was the meat I forgot what's it's called. I think it was pre cooked. It was ok, my favorite was my spicy salmon and the cucumbers. I would come back to get poke here but it's bit of a drive for me. I guess when I'm in Henderson area it's fine."}
{"text":"Such a must go to when you're in Vegas.  This location is on the main street, and if you blink you might miss it, but it's next to Island Sushi and Grill (shares sites).  BOTH so ono! But this review is jus' for the poke and the Garlic Chicken.  Okay, so if you've ever been to Zippys, you know about their Korean Chicken.  Poke Express makes the closest thing on the mainland to Zippy's-- their Garlic chicken is so moist and flavorful-- on the shredded cabbage and shoyu sauce and all. Don't miss out on that.  Poke prices are also reasonable-- they have all kine poke-- tako, mussel, kamaboko, ahi, salmon and also seaweed salad. 

We always take a cooler and bring home for leftovers. They opened a second location in Downtown, with entertainment, but this one is the original!"}
{"text":"Best poke I have found in Las Vegas.   They have a great reliable selection.   Other places,  you never know what they ate gping to have in stock.   Poke Express is airways stocked."}
{"text":"I used to come to Poke Express when they were a part of another restaurant on Eastern, and I may or may not have hyperventilated for a hot second when I found out they moved within 5 minutes driving distance from my home.

In my opinion, I prefer Poke Express over the many poke joints in Vegas. I feel like the quality, flavor, and price of their fish is on point, and I feel like I get my money's worth every time I come. 

They sell fish by the pound, and I usually grab 2 different kinds of fish (1/2 containers each) with a scoop or two of furikake rice. My go-tos are the salmon with shoyu sauce and the ahi tuna because they are so flavorful and fresh. The seasoning doesn't completely overpower the fish like some other poke places, so I'm all for it.

When I'm feeling zesty, I also get the tako kimchi to give my lunch/dinner a little more heat and texture. The kimchi is slightly sweet and the spiciness isn't too much, so it's doable for those of you who want some heat but not something that makes you run for milk or water.

There aren't tables to sit, so it's more of a to-go restaurant. It's not a huge deal for me because I live so close, but even if it were hypothetically further away, I'd probably still swing by, order some salmon, and eat it in my car. It's that good, my friends.

If you haven't tried Poke Express, you definitely should check it out sometime. It's my favorite poke restaurant in Vegas and the flavor combinations/marinades are amazing."}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite when it comes to Poke! It's always super fresh, and the staff is always polite and friendly. I've also tried the muscles here, and they're to die for! I wish I would've tried them sooner. I've lived in this area for 2 years and I just started going here within the last 6 months. Don't wait like I did, people! Go now!"}
{"text":"Poke is not fresh, it was previously frozen. it's still good. This place is close to my house so I usually come by every week. The workers are friendly and helpful. I have yet to try the sushi side."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The poke is always so fresh and if I order more than they have left, they don't hesitate to make more immediately. Everyone that  works here is so nice and brings the friendliest customers in as well. My favorite it the spicy mayo masago poke, and the wasabi poke. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"It's like a deli for poke lovers!!!  We came here this past Saturday and it was amazing to find so many different kinds of poke.  I have never seen that much variety when it comes to poke.  Thank you to all the Yelpers that reviewed it for guiding me to this gem!

The poke is fresh and tasty.  My family visits the islands a lot and this poke is as good as any of the local poke places I've been to in Hawaii.  I love the ahi spicy combo poke  the best.  They also had a variety of tako (octopus) and I chose the kim chee tako this time around.  Quite good.  The taegu (cod fish) is simply delicious.  There is a lot to choose from so take your time and sample whatever looks good to you!

The staff are extremely helpful and patient.  You can try any of the selections from the glass case before choosing to buy it.  I love that!  When I was there, it was pretty busy but I never felt rushed.  The customer service is phenomenal.  

Thank you Poke Express!  I can't wait to visit again next time I'm in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The fact that I don't have to drive 20min. To get awesome poke is great. Only the best can remind me of home... Thanks Poke Express!!!!"}
{"text":"If you LU-LU-LUVVVVVV Pokè then skip the poke burrito bowl places and go to Pokè Express! 

Okay, don't get me wrong, but sometimes I don't want all that fancy stuff that comes with a pokè bowl. I just want the rice and lots of pokè. #dontjudgeme

Maybe that's just the island boi in me...

You can choose your poke of choice and there is quite a few choices. They have shoyu, garlic, sweet chili, wasabi and oyster sauce to name a few Pokè. But they also had Tako Pokè (octopus) and some seafood Pokè style choices. I always get the Shoyu Pokè and then I'll pick one other to try which I mix up every time I go there. This is probably the most authentic Pokè you can get that taste like how they make them in Hawaii.

The fish tastes as fresh as you're gonna get being that we live in the desert.

Not only do they have Pokè but other Hawaiian treats that you could pick up and won't find in your local super markets.

Definitely give these locals a try because they do not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Love this place! A place took me here once and I was HOOKED for weeks! The only thing I ask and that bums me out is that they're always out of salmon. Maybe please try to stock more? Because I'd really like to spend my money here with you guys more often than I do. ;-)"}
{"text":"We made a pit stop before heading back Utah and found this place in Vegas.Poke is awsome here!! Customer service on point.We definitely be back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this place is the real deal! Not like the other new trendy poke shops, this is what you'd find on the islands. I came in for lunch while running around town, and this place was packed! Line out the door...which I'm so glad about. I love seeing businesses like Poke Express thrive. I got half a pound of the spicy avocado ahi poke....absolutely perfect. Not saucy or mayo tasting, just genuine Hawaiian style poke. I felt like I was on vacation! I got my meal for less than $8. Where else could you get half a pound of poke for $7.77? If you're debating whether or not to come here, stop debating and go...you won't regret it. My only regret is that I didn't come here sooner. Poke Express, you are doing it right! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I can't say how much I love this. I use to drive all the way from my work up here to the other location for lunch.  So many great things but I love the following.

Taco KimChee Poke
Spicy Ahi Poke with Avocado
Wasabi Ahi
Ahi with Oyster Sauce
Furikake Ahi
Dry Seasoned Aku

For non fish
Kimchee cucumbers
Ocean Salad
Picked Garlic

So good I always buy too much and probably eat too much raw fish every week."}
{"text":"Omg!!! Why can't we have this in California. Reminds me of home ... Tanioka :( Ahi furikake and Spicy Tuna is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Poke on the ninth island doesn't get any better than this.

It's dangerous how close my current rotation is to Poke Express, I come here just about every other week.  Poke Express is located in Island Sushi towards the back of the restaurant.  The restaurant has changed over the years, they now are open later and offer more variety of poke.  I remember when they ran out of a certain flavor, they would be out for the day and I was forced to come early for what I wanted.  Now, if they are running low of a certain kind of poke, they will gladly make you one to order!  That's the biggest plus to me!  Now I can get Spicy Masago and Mayo anytime I want!  

Another thing that's great about the guys at Poke Express is how hospitable they are.  Sometimes the lines can get long, but they take their time and makes sure everyone leaves happy.  They offer samples if you can't decide which one to choose.  My favorites beside the spicy masago and mayo include spicy avocado ahi and furikake ahi.  

Prices are by the pound.  Most items are priced around $16/lb.  They have different sizes of containers depending on your need, I like that you don't have to order a full pound, you can get a third or half pound if you are looking to try different kinds or just want a smaller portion.  

I always grab my poke to go, but you can dine in and they also offer rice if you want to make it a poke bowl."}
{"text":"The best poke in Vegas hands down in my opinion. Love this place!! The ahi tuna is always perfect, I have never had a bad experience here and I eat here quite a bit. My favorite are the spicy avocado ahi and the wasabi ahi."}
{"text":"I love this place! We got enough food to feed 4 people for $35.  Try finding enough sushi grade fish to feed 4 people for THAT anywhere else in town!

We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Soooo yummy! The food here is so great and the poke is the best I've had in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I finally found a five star in my own near my area!

Walking in for the first time was kind of deceiving with how small the place was, but it was most definitely the food! that was that was bringing out all the hype.
They let us sample everything before we bought and had to stop because we were getting everything we sampled. Lol

Imitation Crab Poke 8
Smoked Tako 8
Smoked Ahi 9
Mussel Poke8
Tako Kimchee 10!
Seasoned Chuka Tako 9
Smoked Marlin 10!

If you show up right when they open, you get to sample all 7 recipes of their Ahi Poke.  =d"}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Fresh poke and the selection is incredible my wife and I just went to Hawaii last year and this is as close as it gets to the selection and freshness the Island will give you! I definitely recommend this place. Also the staff is very helpful, kind and offer samples upon request.  Hands down best poke / Island spot in Vegas! Be sure to stop in they will exceed your expectations!"}
{"text":"Had my first taste of poke at a fine dining establishment, and needed a poor woman's version....Yelp helped me find Poke Express...and OMG...It's like i died and gone to Hawaii....only I've never been there.  But if i had, i can only imagine that the poke here is as good as the poke in Hawaii.  The tuna - it's like butter. Add some rice and avocado and lock me away forever.  It could easily be my last meal on earth."}
{"text":"Been coming here for months now. Look and pick what they had. But just yesterday they changed the whole thing. There's menus and now you can build your own poke bowl! I like that they make things to order now but because of that it takes longer to get the food. It used to be ask, pack, pay, go. I don't know if I like this new set up and new thing. And it didn't look like they had exactly what they used to have on display before. They took things out..."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive out to enjoy this absolute gem!  The Spicy Ahi, Hawaiian Style and Spicy Avocado Ahi are favorites and their Ocean Salad is better than most places I've tried.  The staff are super friendly and they even have Hawaiian Pantry items, including Furikake and other items that are harder to find, and even have mochi available.  You will not be disappointed stopping in here!"}
{"text":"This is a Vegas staple!! I have out-of-towners that always make Poke Express a must during their trip! Shanelle (spellcheck) and Scott always greet people with a smile, remembers the regulars by name, and their usual orders. Their customer service has always been spot on!

The salmon with special sauce is oh so buttery with the perfect texture, and the spicy ahi with mayo tastes amazing atop a scoop of rice with furikake. They also offer $2 off per lb on most dishes excluding the salmon and sashimi platters with a military ID.

Their new location is even better! It reminds me of their location up North on Craig. No more snaking through people and tables anymore at Island Sushi! Nevermind all the artisinal poke places that have been popping up all over town recently. They can't hold a candle to Poke Express!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times this past week. Needless to say, the poke here is amazing, and the worker there remembers us hahah!! The flavors they use (my fave is the Spicy Ahi and the Limu Ahi) complement the ahi so well! I honestly don't think you can really go wrong with any of the flavors here! Texture and taste of their food is on point :) Like the other yelpers have said here, go early if you want to sample any of their pokes, because they run out of them by around 2-3! 

If you're a procrastinator like me, have no fear! If you don't see your flavor there, they can always make it for you in the back :) Come before 2-3 to get rice w/ furrikake for $1.50 because they tend to run out of those!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. I love this place. Where else in Vegas can you get fish this fresh and just be able to walk out the door with it and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home? I'm going to say... hardly anywhere. 

I came to Poke Express with the intention to pick up some poke. But as I entered I saw that it is also connected to Island Sushi. What a wonderous place this little hole in the wall is. It is bursting with amazingness! You can get Hawaiian plates, sushi, and poke and be able to sit down and eat them right there. OR you can do what I did, which is to go straight to the poke counter and order up delicious poke to go in little containers!

The poke here is priced based off of market prices, so sometimes you may come and find your poke has fluctuated in price, but considering the quality of the fish and the great way the poke is prepared, I would be more than willing to spend a few extra bucks if market prices are high. There are many varieties. On my visit I ordered the Spicy Ahi with Avocado and the Salmon Poke (with special sauce). I have since tried both and they are both so good. The salmon may even be better to me than the spicy ahi AND it was a cheaper price. 

I can't even imagine eating fish any other way now. I don't want baked cod, I don't want smoked salmon, I don't want sushi covered in rice, I just want POKE!"}
{"text":"My first time going to this place was 2/19/16. The young man that helped me was very helpful and they even let you sample the items before you buy. I cannot tell you how freakin good this place is! If you order ahi poke at a restaurant, their portions are ridiculously small and way overpriced. This place is a better choice in price and quality. My favorite, hands down, is the spicy avocado ahi poke."}
{"text":"They have a huge variety of marinated poke that you can choose from, and better yet, they let you sample before you commit! Their selection is better than the poke shack in hawaii! The only down side is that they don't serve poke bowls, you'd have to buy rice on the side for $1.50 and they give you a generous amount. Another down side is that they're more of a market so they don't have any seating."}
{"text":"The is the BEST poke I have had since Hawaii!!! Tako Kimchi Poke...FABULOUS!
Spicy AHI Avocado Poke...FABULOUS!  AHI Wasabi Poke...Fabulous! It melts in your mouth. This is my new addiction! I'm sorry I didn't go here sooner!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, Awesome Poke! each bite took me back home to Hawaii! BEST POKE IN VEGAS! HANDS DOWN!"}
{"text":"I drove by on a Wednesday and they were closed.  This time I made sure they were opened.  They were located on W Craig Rd/west of I-15 in North Las Vegas.

I was given 2 samples of Ahi Poke.  The first one was the traditional Ahi Poke.  The second one was a Shoyu Ahi Poke.  I ended up buying 8 ounces of the traditional Ahi Poke.  There were big chunks of firm ahi with just enough flavorful marinade.  The ahi wasn't swimming in the sauce.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best poke in Vegas. They have a variety of poke to choose from. Our favorite is the spicy tuna. The octopus is my least favorite. It's very bland and not very appetizing.  If you've never tried poke, I suggest you may want to ask the servers to give you a sample.  It is raw tuna with seaweed, soy sauce and special sauce. It really is an acquired taste. 
This is not a restaurant by the way, it's more like a specialty Hawaiian mini mart. They have several items there that you may want to purchase as well. The Portuguese sausage is really delish. Their hours of operation is very limiting.
So if you're craving for Poke  or just want to be daring and try something new, this is a place to go. Located at Craig Rd. North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't leave a review here yet. This poke is seriously good - as good as the best places in Honolulu. Local peeps behind the counters - super sweet. We go there twice a week. If you're in Vegas but miss Hawaii - go for some delicious poke at Poke Express. Best flavor: spicy avocado."}
{"text":"A wide range of nice looking poke and related Hawaii food dishes are served on a take-out basis here. Having tasted their poke, I can certainly see why this place is so popular. I also liked their soy beans which are prepared in the exact same way as they would be in Hawaii. Oh wait, I forgot. Las Vegas is Hawaii's Ninth Island.

I hope they will open a store on the west side of town one day in the future."}
{"text":"It's as close to home as I can get and right around the street from the house.  Staff is aloha-spirit to da max and takes care of you for whatever you need.  Go on the days they have the poke bowls... I can't remember what day.  They also have fresh poi."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE Poke express! Especially the mussell poke. If you're looking for more than just Ahi poke, then this is the place. Not only do they have about 5 or 6 different kinds of Ahi poke, they have tako, opihi (top shelf), mussels, yummy goodness! The staff is super friendly with great pigeon accents and if you are weary, they let you sample some first before buying. I usually buy two or three kinds for myself and end up chowing down on them as soon as I step out the door. 

The only downside is the store hours. I wish they were longer for those night cravings, but still five stars!"}
{"text":"Walking through the doors is pretty much like being back home for a moment.  People who have true aloha, 'ono poke and all kine random stuff from Hawaii.  One stop shopping for all the \"little\" things people from Hawaii need: shoyu (check), rice (check), mochi ice cream (check), portugese sausage, laulau, kalua pig, even soda and creme crackers!!! Favorites here: spicy ahi, dried aku poke, kimchee shrimp, hawaiian style poke (no inamona, extra hawaiian salt) and edamame (heavy on the sauce)!!! Thursdays is the poi shipment day, and there's maki and cone sushi on either Sundays or Mondays.  Go early, they go super fast! 
One of my favorite places to be...and to be brutally honest, I actually bought my house in North LV just so I could be close by.  I have been accused of being crazy because of this--but at least I'm full and totally satisfied! :)"}
{"text":"Holy cow, was this place a find.  and I never would have found it without Yelp.

The lady behind the counter was so patient and nice, she let us sample absolutely everything.  I've never had salmon like that in my life.  Melt-in-your mouth goodness.  Some sort of sweet soy sauce salmon.
Seriously we could not get enough of the seafood we ordered at this place.

There is nothing like this in NYC.  Please let them open a branch up here!"}
{"text":"Best poke place in town no other can compare and great staff and owners, they make it with their hearts and take very good care of customers"}
{"text":"Friendly folks work here. Sampled the Tako Poke. Picked up Hawaiian Frost Honeydew Melon and Coconut.  Got the Avocado ahi, Limu Ahi and dried Aku to take on the road with me.  All were high grade, fresh, full flavored and I wanted more. I came as they opened so they had everything.  I was surprised to see their display case with lots to choose from. I went to other shops and Poke Express had a wide variety. Good going Poke Express! I felt I was home for a second.  Pretty easy to get to from the Strip. This is a take out place so I sat on the steps and bricks right outside.  It's Poke. Almost didn't make it to my car. I need to order bigger containers next time.  Skip the The Strip Prices and come here"}
{"text":"Still delicious.  We made a trip here on our way out of town and had it for dinner.  Just as good the second time."}
{"text":"This Review is for Poke Express & Island Grill.  They also have a \"All you can eat sushi\" restaurant next door (all connecting).  My wife and I are from the Bay Area and this place beats out any Hawaiian restaurants near us.

We basically were looking to just get poke, but also ordered lunch plate and saimin.  We got the Garlic Chicken and Mochiko Chicken lunch plate and the Tempura Saimin.  We also tried the Spicy Ahi Poke.  Everything was GONE and was soooo delicious.  Definalely coming back next time we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is this excellent. I highly recommend. 

We came on a Tuesday (monday and Tuesday 10-2pm) they have poke bowls: 2 scoops of rice (1.50) and the price per weight of fish. 

Their quality was 5/5 for everything. We stay away from mayo based poke but the following were amazing. 
Spicy avocado ahi poke
Sweet chili ahi poke
Ahi poke hawaiian poke

The staff were friendly and actually encouraged trying before buying their product. 

You like to go back to a place like this. They're nice, they're local, and amazing quality it's what we need more of. With one visit you made a regular out of me."}
{"text":"Hands down the best poke in vegas! I love that this little shop is located close to my work. It's set up deli style so grab and go with no seating. I recommend getting there earlier in the day than later since they tend to run out of some flavors.

My personal favorite is the spicy avocado poke, so good! They also offer poke bowls from 10-2 pm. It's really a great, delicious option for lunch."}
{"text":"AWESOME POKE HERE. So fresh and authentic - love the way they prepare the fish! We got to try a mix of three tuna and salmon variations and loved all of them, especially the shoyu... It makes me truly feel like I'm in Hawaii! My family lives a few minutes away so I don't mind that they're a to-go business since we can stop in and eat at home, but I can see that being a downside for those traveling far and having to eat in their cars... (But still so worth it IMO.) Man what I would do to have a spot like this in St. Pete, FL! Anyways, Can't wait for the next time I'm in town - I'll be sure to make my way back here!"}
{"text":"I don't have a whole lot to add. They simply have awesome poke. I used to get the poke bowls when I worked in Las Vegas. The poke flavors are excellent and the fish is fresh, which I still don't understand since Vegas is land locked."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Hawaii so when it comes to eating poke, my expectations are high. One of the best places in Vegas that has poke that tastes just like back at home."}
{"text":"When you finally find that poke place you were always looking for. :)

This place is heaven sent and I love everything that they have. The fish is always fresh and by always I really mean always. I love how consistent they are. It is just the best! ALL of there poke is delicious... I mean ALL of it. My favorite is the Ahi Poke with ocean salad. The kimchi cucumbers are bomb and the furikake rice is amazing. It can get a little pricey depending on what you order and how much but my average for 2 people comes out to about $25 average. It is still a lot of food though so order accordingly or your going to have a lot of leftovers but that is not a bad thing. I will forever come here for my poke fix. Thank you so much for doing what you do Poke Express!"}
{"text":"They are going to start opening on Wednesdays!!! yay!  I went by yesterday for a snack and ended up getting to taste all sorts of things while meeting the owner, Darren.  He mixes sauce fresh in with the fish right there!  I got tako wasabi *small amount* :) plus salmon poke with spicy sauce and masago + furikake ahi poke.  I got to taste the dried aku which is good (bonito/skipjack) but I just couldn't have it all this time.  Yum yum everything was so fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"***** Five Stars. I wish I could give this place more stars. This place is a poke lovers dream. They have several different kinds of poke for you to pick from. The store looked very clean and the girl behind the counter was very nice. I like that they let you sample the poke. There was so many options.

The mussel poke was my favorite. We tried the sweet chile mussel poke and the kimchi mussel poke. The mussels were huge and it was seasoned perfectly. We tried some of the other poke, but the other one that stood out to me was the tuna poke in oyster sauce. They were all excellent though.

I also tried the seasoned dry aku for the first time. It was not too bad. It is like fish jerky. We also ordered the ocean salad...Very good!!

They do not have any tables to sit down at and eat your poke. It is like purchasing your poke from a market and taking it home. They really should add a few tables in there or maybe some patio seating.

It was definitely worth the drive from Summerlin. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best. Poke. Ever 
They have so many varieties, and they are happy to let you sample before you buy. 
This is not a sit down restaurant, you can buy their delicious poke in bulk to have at home or you can purchase it in poke bowl form.
The service was so friendly! 
Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Great customer service, amazing seafood. I wish some of the stuff wasn't so expensive but it definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome! 

Best poke I have ever had!

Brought some friends from the islands over there and they were amazed, said the cuts of fish are better than what they have on average over there.  

If you like poke or even if you just like fish you NEED to go here."}
{"text":"Uh-MAY-zing!  I travel to Vegas twice a month for work, and I get really bummed when I don't have time to eat at Poke Express.  It's in a nondescript strip mall, but don't let the location fool you.  This is the real deal.  This is not a dine-in place, but I enjoy that because I can run in, grab a variety of yumminess, and run out and move on with my day.  

They have a great variety, and it's all super fresh - no fishy smell in this poke place!  I've tried a variety of the poke offerings, as well as some of the veggie dishes.  The service is fast and friendly.  They offer samples and will describe any dish you're curious about.  

Fresh, flavorful, and totally reasonable prices.  Go there - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place!  We found it on Yelp due to its amazing reviews, and they are well deserved!  I travel to Vegas 1-2 times a month for work, and try to make it to Poke Express every time I'm in town.

The storefront is unassuming, tucked into the corner of a strip mall on Craig Road.  The shop is small, but super clean, uncluttered, and stocked with a small variety of items.  But the star of the show is their poke selection (of course).  They have tuna, salmon, octopus, eel, krab, and I'm sure I'm missing other fish - but I always stick to the salmon and tuna.  I am also a big fan of the kimchi cucumbers, and a sucker for the seaweed salad.  They have a variety of flavors - furikake, mayo, spicy, kimchi, with or without tobiko, etc, etc.

Everything always looks completely fresh.  There are no dried spills between containers, no dry edges on the mounds of poke, and the store doesn't smell fishy.  All in all, five stars...I would give it six if I could!"}
{"text":"BEST spot ever!!!  I literally want to order every single thing when I come here. Luckily for me and my lack of self control I live clear on the other side of town or Id eat here every day! The spicy tako poke is my favorite.... and the ocean salad is my favorite in town too.... but I  truly love them all! Soo good doesn't even begin to describe it. I am not alone in this thought because there are days that if you don't get there early enough you will miss that bomb diggity poke boat and be ship outta luck- all sold out??!?!  Yep! wahhhhh noooooo!   Once you get that poke craving it can only be sassified by Poke Express! It is take out only and I rarely get outta the parking lot before I just say screw it and repark and get to to pokemonin! LOL   You can pre order large portions for parties ( or just for you to go to crazy town on if thats your thing).  What can I say... Id poke all day!"}
{"text":"Best poke in town!  Employees are awesome!  Simple real poke no crazy add ons like the other places in town."}
{"text":"Outstanding place to get legit poke.  This store is like a deli which serves up fresh, great tasting poke at a reasonable price.  They have great variety and I was extremely happy with my order.  The owner is very nice and friendly and I could tell he sincerely wanted me to enjoy my poke.  Another great thing is that they offer a military discount on all their ahi poke.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone craving poke over the lame poke bowl places popping up and have no idea what real poke is."}
{"text":"This is a 3 part restaurant in one place.  There is the sushi largest section, the poke and the grill part are in the other sections.  Ordered a mini garlic chicken comes with 1 scoop of rice and mac or green salad, had the green salad, came with a vinaigrette that was good.  The Poke I had the furkikake, avocado and lumi - 1/3 portions of each (smallest) goes on up. The furkikake was excellent could have had more onions, the avocado needed more avocado (got one small piece) and the lumi was ok.  Over all good fresh poke's but they need to add a little more of the sides i.e. onions, avocado, or seaweed.  Clean and staff is friendly and fast.  Made to order dishes, not under a heat lamp.  Will go back for more."}
{"text":"It's confirmed. Poke Express is the real deal and worthy of an upgrade to five stars.

After finally trying Hawaiian Style Poke a couple of weeks ago and then going back to Poke Express today, I can definitively say that I prefer Poke Express. Their fish tastes fresher, they have a wider variety, and their flavors are just richer.

But what truly makes me a fan of Poke Express is the couple behind the counter. They are just some of the nicest owners you could ever meet. No matter what, they are always ready and willing to give you as many samples as you need. This helped me out because they have several spicy varieties. After trying them all, I went with the Wasabi. Boy does that have some kick to it! It was eye-watering and it was damn good."}
{"text":"the best place for poke in Vegas hands down! growing up in Hawaii, I was always eating fish, raw fish and I love it. When I moved to the mainland, it was difficult to find fresh poke. You may find places that offer poke but to get the real deal, you must try poke Express. besides the delicious poke and other goodies, the staff is so nice. it makes me miss home and the Aloha spirit. thanks Poke express. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Based on many reviews here on Yelp, I decided to drive out, way out, to check out this little hidden gem. 
I'm glad I rented a car, cuz I'd never travel this far by cab or Uber on a hunch. 

Got there right when they opened. Good variety of Poke, great selection based upon where this is located. For a moment I felt like I was back shopping Foodland in Hawaii.

I ordered the Kamaboko Poke. That's not what they named it, but that what it was. Can't remember what they called it, but it's the FishCake type. Very good. Server dished exactly #.33.

Next was a mix of Limu Poke and Spicy Tuna Poke. 
Limu was good with crunchy Ogo. Spicy Tuna was flavored nicely. Tuna seemed fresh, and I am a total fresh fish snob.

Price was good too. Excellent I should say, as tuna was $14.99/lb , and the Kamaboko was $6.99/lb. 

Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The best POKE I have had so far! So may choice to choose from. My favorite is the Wasabi Ahi. One taste and now I'm hooked! Far from our house, but it's definitely worth the 30 minute drive."}
{"text":"Although I'm so full - had to pop by for some pupu's to take to the pool.  Tried out some samples and I must say they need to have one open in AZ. Thank you and Mahalo."}
{"text":"Thanks to poke express I don't have to go all the way downtown to get really great poke now! Authenic! Good grade fish, just like home.only wish they had idako more often ...that is all."}
{"text":"Love the shoyu poke and limu poke bowls!  Perfect snack before the long drive home back to Cali.  The fish is fresh!"}
{"text":"I Love This Place ! It's The Closest Thing To Back Home Hawaii. Forever My Favorite Place For Poke. & Its The Only Place That Has Kim Chee Tako & Mussels."}
{"text":"Omg eat here. The fish is so fresh. Recommend the spicy chili animal poke with rice and furikake"}
{"text":"One word: ONO.  Being a local girl who grew up on poke- this definitely hits the spot and satisfies my local grinds cravings whenever  I am on my annual vacation in Las Vegas every November.  This past November's trip was a little different being that we were up there for my destination wedding!  I actually inquired with Poke Express to see if they would be able to cater a variety of poke for our cocktail hour and add to the assortment of pupu's...because honestly, what is a local, hawaiian wedding WITHOUT poke? It's junk-that's what it is! LOL Unfortunately, they do not deliver to the actual event but they are more than helpful and willing to take on a big order of poke for any special event you may have in mind.  

The process was rather simple to make the order and they even invited us to come into the location and taste test all the different types of poke they have, which made it deliciously difficult to decide which one we would choose.  We ended up ordering 15 lbs of poke with the selection of Ahi Limu, Ahi Garlic and Spicy Ahi, which were separated into individual trays filled with 5 lbs of poke in each.  Needless to say, I wish we ordered 20 lbs altogether because before cocktail hour ended almost ALL of the poke was gone.  All of guests, mainly all of our family from Hawaii who made the trek out to Las Vegas, raved about how good the poke was & how much they enjoyed it- even til' this day, I still have my family and friends mention to me about how much they liked the poke. Granted my husband & I only got a few bites in of poke on our wedding day, we are happy that our family & friends got to enjoy the ono poke from Poke Express.  Mahalo plenty for working with us and making it possible to have a little taste of home be a part of our special occasion."}
{"text":"Ironically enough, if you're willing to venture off the Strip in Vegas, sometimes you'll hit a jackpot. Poke Express is one of those type of gems uniquely delivering the Hawaiian islands flavor in the desert that is Las Vegas. 

We went at around 11am on Sunday and they had initially already sold out of malasadas.  Fortunately, they were able to make another batch (w/in 20 minutes) and when fresh, these were amazing. Whether custard filled or just plain, the coating of sugar and the nice crisp flaky dough was tremendous. I recently had a batch frozen and delivered from Hawaii and these malasadas were comparable in quality. 

Then there's the star of the show, the poke. Really good poke to be exact. I can't attest to how it compares to poke in Hawaii but from all thirdhand accounts it matches up. Not quite there in terms of freshness but a close alternative. 

My favorite was the shoyu poke because the sauce is a great balance of sweetness that marinades the salmon or tuna to perfection. The spicy avocado poke was more spicy than I expected but having never tried avocado and poke mixed together, I thought it was pretty fantastic. 

I'd steer clear from the seaweed soaked poke as the salinity of the seaweed was too overpowering. 

They serve their poke by the 1/4, 1/2, and 1 lb sizes and we started by trying four different 1/4 lb. containers. Just a note, thats not nearly enough and we had to double up on what we ordered between two people. 

Overall, its affordable and delicious comfort food served with welcoming hospitality. It's like your own slice of Hawaii only a couple thousand miles away.

Tip: Get here early, especially on the weekends, because at noon this place is jam packed with large parties."}
{"text":"Now this is Poke as it should be. Feels like it's straight outta the islands of Hawaii. 

They let you sample each of the fish so you can see what you really like. That's perfect when you don't know how one marinade or sauce will interact with the fish.

Either way pretty much everything they serve is good."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Amazing quality fish, price is pretty fair considering they obviously have it flown in. I get the spicy ahi and have them make it spicier. So good. I don't live in vegas but when I visit my friend I always make sure to stop here."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go for a long time, but it's hard for me to make it before they close at 6pm. I got there w/ 10 minutes to spare, so basically all the tuna was gone and I couldn't taste all the different things. They still had dried fish looking things and other stuff that doesn't need to be so fresh. The prices for the tuna is about $10.99 a pound, so it's pricey, but not if you compare it to sitting in a restaurant. I ordered some stuff w/o trying, but they were pretty darn good. We had the spicy tuna poke and the furikaki tuna poke. I loved that they go in the back and make a fresh batch for you. While I was waiting, I tried the Kimchi Taco poke (Octopus) and it was really good, so of course I had to get some of that cuz my dad loves Octopus and I knew he'd love such a snack w/ some cold beer.
I also love salmon, but they said it's a huge seller and you have to order that in advance, cuz they always run out. I'm totally going to order the salmon w/ the spicy sauce next time. I have to try and come on a morning when I'm off so I can sample all the different things and get a better idea of what I'd like. I did not like the kimchi mussel poke, but that's just me.

on a side note:
parking is plentiful, location is hard to find on Craig, but look for the Party supply store. i haven't tried the Eastern and Serene location at Island Sushi, but since it's not too far from my work, I'm totally going to get some for lunch and buy some rice at Island sushi. there was just a husband and wife so when they place is a little busy, it's not going to be fast service. this japanese couple from hawaii is super nice. maybe because i was there so late, they never pushed me to try a bunch of things."}
{"text":"I don't know where they get the daily fresh fish required to make the best poke outside of Hawaii.  The poke is tasty and quite authentic.  Loved the spicy tuna with avocado.  The friendly staff caters to all with a friendly smile"}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. AMAZING! So delicious. This is not a restaurant, it's a market with poke by the pound. Authentic Hawaiian. They will make you a poke bowl with however much poke, rice, and even seaweed salad you want. The quality of the tuna far surpasses ANY other poke place I've tried. Specifically these new ones popping up around town. Want fresh, incredible fish? Go here."}
{"text":"Seen pretty good reviews of this place on yelp so I decided to give it a try. It's pretty good and authentic poke! One of the best ones in Las Vegas and in Henderson. Many places have poke but not as many choices as poke express. Ordered the spicy avo ahi and salmon poke and they were both great. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Seriously so fresh! It's mos def better than our highly rated Santo Market in San Jose!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted! I love this place. I love everything I have tried. I am so glad I found this wonderful, delicious place! The staff is friendly and welcoming. I was offered samples of everything.  I will be back again and again (Probably today)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today (8/20/12) and saw the following note posted: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ewmTwsZqCHH2gvCeDKz0dw?select=GN9FFYajLyrz9m8Nm7b_-w#GN9FFYajLyrz9m8Nm7b_-w

From what I remember, most poke was about $9.99/lb when I first started coming here; now it seems prices are around $16.99/lb for most poke.  Same quality food, but higher prices.  With those prices, I'd recommend getting one the poke bowl specials (not pokeball specials) on Mondays and Tuesdays: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ewmTwsZqCHH2gvCeDKz0dw#XgryYTqiWJlmS5EE1cBgWQ"}
{"text":"Definitely a place to go if comfort food is what you seek for. The variety of poke in the deli in the back is a good start to the food adventure. Tried salmon poke, and two kinds of ahi poke (kimchee and furukake)  Then dove into the garlic chicken plate. Definitely haven't had garlic chicken like this since Hawaii. Rounding out with freshly made malasadas!! Yummo. A place added onto my bookmarks. Must return!!!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The food is very tasty and at a very reasonable price. The service is also top notch and friendly. Try the pokes before you buy is also very helpful."}
{"text":"Staff was so friendly and quick!! Prices were very reasonable!!  No samurai (Hawaiian frost) soft serve at the moment but may bring it back soon for the summer season, so I stocked up on the pre-packed cups for now!  Went at 3pm and salmon poke was already sold out earlier in the day"}
{"text":"So we all know that poke is the next big trend and Las Vegas already knew this.  This place is located in a strip mall, like so many places in Vegas, and at first it was hard to locate but their huge sign made up for it. The shop is organized by poke on the left and miscellaneous goods on the right - goods as in frozen saimin, cake mixes and etc, items that you can only find in some specialty stores. 

When we arrived, there was a small line. But the guys behind the counter move fast. There were several small batches of poke that you could choose from. There were also seaweed salad, kimchi cucumbers and other items that you can order if you don't want just poke. 

The boyfriend and I ordered half a pound of the garlic ahi poke with shoyu on the side and half a pound of spicy avocado ahi poke.  Both were delicious!  The ahi was excellent and the flavors were on point. They did run out of the spicy avocado ahi poke but they readily replenished it. It seems as if they are always prepping and they prep small batches so that you get the freshest poke and it's just not sitting there for quite some time. 

Overall our group spent a pretty penny at this shop but it was well worth it. We would definitely go back again and again and again and again...you get the idea."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.  I'm glad my friends found this place because any time we are in Vegas, we always make sure to stop here.  Their poke is the best and legit.  I am so glad you can order by the pound.  They definitely aren't the trendy poke bowl shop, so don't expect it when you go here.  It's a small shop, so be aware that there's no place to sit to eat.  It's definitely a to go shop. 

The prices are fair.  The variety is also awesome.  They have so many different kinds to choose from.  The staff is always friendly and if you have any questions, they are always willing to help out.  The last time we went here, we got there 15 minutes before they closed.  If you don't see what you want (any style ahi poke), they will make it for you on the spot.  We always get the shoyu ahi and garlic ahi and they are always flavored well.  My friends love getting the scallops and the tako.  Both are always nicely seasoned and not one flavor is overpowering.  They cut the fish perfectly and it's a consistent size all the time. 

Again, the flavors, the price point, the variety and the staff is what brings me back every single time I'm in town.  One of the best poke I've had on the mainland."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Can't say enough good  things about this place. Coming from the east coast, I had not had an opportunity to have a dish like this since I went to the islands over a decade ago. You walk up and the couple behind the counter make you feel so welcome. You can sample anything before you buy it, on Mondays the price drops per pound, and they comply very easily with special requests (more spicy, less spicy,more sauce, less sauce). Their prices can be a shock at first but going to your local supermarket, you'll find the same prices per pound without the special care they take to make the yummy poke. Overall, I say RUN don't walk to Poke Express. And hurry cuz they close at 6pm on the weekdays and 8pm on weekends or whenever they run out of fish whichever comes first."}
{"text":"I love poke express. The first time I came here the guy behind the counter let us try like 10 different kinds because we had no idea what to order. That narrowed it down for us but it was still hard to pick 4 kinds (2 in each bowl). This time I knew better than to order all spicy items, so I got 1/3 pound of ahi limu and scarfed it down without even needing rice. This fish is seriously like CANDY, and it's the best poke I've had in any desert hands down. If you're in town and like poke/raw fish, coming here is an absolute MUST - you can't skip it."}
{"text":"After going to the one on Craig rd, the guy there told me there's a closer one to me off S. Eastern considering that I'm off Blue Diamond. The one off S. Eastern didn't have that much on the different type of Poke comparing to the store on Craig. The plus side for the Eastern store is that they sell Hawaiian food along side their poke. I have to remember not to get there around 12:30..."}
{"text":"It took me several months, but I finally took the time to drive to this location from Blue Diamond, just to find out that there's one off S. Eastern. I got there just when they open, walked in and seeing all the different poke and trying almost everyone of them was awesome. I couldn't decide, they all tasted freaking great.. I ended up getting the spicy mayo poke, the wasabi poke and the Ahi w/ Oyster Sauce, all three I ask them to make them extra spicy with their Habanero sauce..I think  lvl 5 or 6... Well, worth the drive.... Deserve another visit soon"}
{"text":"Poke express inside is freaking amazing. Fish has no tendon, and was pre marinated first. When poke done right, it's like rolling around the clouds. They will let you sample their food and if they are out of something, you can ask them to make it for you on the spot. Very friendly and hands down the best poke around."}
{"text":"I'm a big ahi tuna poke fan, so I was very excited to check this place out! I tried the regular Ahi Tuna Poke and the Spicy Ahi Poke. I loved the regular Ahi Tuna Poke! The Spicy Ahi Poke was good, but not quite as good as the regular Ahi. The fish was so fresh and delicious. I find myself craving it! This is a place I will definitely be visiting again so I can try another of their many poke options."}
{"text":"They have huge variety of selection of poke. Always fully stocked and the price is worth every bite! Will be coming soon again."}
{"text":"I'm in from out of town for a conference and staying across the street from this place. I saw it when I arrived (late at night) but somehow knew I had to try it out...it just looked legit.  I tried to stop by my first night in town but they were already closed (the only bad thing I saw was that they close too early). I snuck away from my conference to avoid crappy hotel dinner and had a little party on the back of my rental car. 5 x 1/3 lb containers of various poke and a scoop of rice. Best picnic ever! Staff was very helpful and friendly too...I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"GOOD GOOD GOOD I just wish I lived closer! PLZ PLZ PLZ open one near College and 95 SOON! it would be packed there is NOTHING even close out here!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here several times and I've never had a problem. The quality is amazing and the staff is great. Most of the time, if they are out of something they can make it for you on the spot. I'm such a creature of habit. I always get the wasabi tuna and the salmon. It's amazing every time!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! Their products are flavorful and high in quality. Staff's friendly and welcoming ... just like home. The ahi spicy combo is a must try."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmark for years and I finally get to try it today! I had some training up on North Las Vegas so I decided to give it a try. It definitely earn my 5-star!! The owner is really nice and willing to let you try any poke. I ended up with the salmon poke and tuna poke! The freshness of the fish is really good quality. It reminds me of poke in Hawaii. 

The place is a bit small, no sit down. Just pretty much order to go. They specialize in all types of poke! It's worth a try if you are a poke fan.. love it and will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Man, I am totally sold on this place!

It was my first trip here since I saw people talking about this place on yelp. While all the different seafood and sauce combinations were intimidating at first, the gentleman that took my order walked me through how everything tasted and thoroughly explained everything to me. I was allowed to have multiple samples of anything I pointed out, which was really cool of him.

Everything I sampled and everything I took home to eat was awesome. The tuna was soft and succulent and the various tako I had was not rubbery or overly chewy as they can be at other establishments. I was especially sold on the tako kim chee. I will definitely be getting that on any subsequent visit, on top of any new things I try.

I knew going in there that poke can be expensive, so I went in with a budget. That plan failed miserably since I ended up buying a bunch of different things, but it didn't matter since all of it ended up tasting awesome.

With the helpful employees, and excellent quality food, I plan on coming here again to try more stuff."}
{"text":"Poke Express is my go to for quality fish/seafood! I prefer the Craig location but this location is great as well. The wait time is definitely longer here and there are less options to choose from as far as the seafood bar but they are connected to a sushi joint & they offer actual Hawaiian food as well. Service is always excellent & I can never have enough of their spicy ahi!"}
{"text":"I love Poke Express! Great service. They let you have samples of anything you'd like to try. It's not the cheapest but the quality of the fish & seafood is worth it. My favorite is the spicy ahi. I easily fork out the money to buy 1-2 lbs at a time. No rice or anything needed."}
{"text":"A lonely Saturday night.  Brothers were not interested in eating because of  a heavy lunch.  I went on Yelp, and typed \"Dinner\" and found POKE EXPRESS!!  

What a pleasant surprise!!!  

I tried to find their menu online, but I called to confirm they don't have one.  Oh well, so I drive down and ready to get some quick dinner to go. 

I arrived around 7pm.  While there weren't many options left, they still had less than a pound of salmon left.  The guy who was helping me was asking me what to add in it, and I advised him I have never been here before.  He was very happy to help and offered samples of what they do have left.  I ended up getting the salmon (all of that's left), a quarter pound of the raw octopus, and half a pound of something like clams (I don't remember what it's called - but it's DELICIOUS!)  All for less than $20!

The guy also tell me that if I arrive earlier around 11am / 12pm, I would have more options to choose from.  I am definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Best poke I've had.
Love that everything is generally \"Hawaiian.\" Regardless of the style interpretations, it is honestly the best tasting poké. There's not bowl or burritos that are there to be trendy. Just real fish that makes your mouth feel like it died and went to heaven. 
They have a variety of poké flavors and the average price is a little higher as you buy per the lbs. be sure to look online first so there are no shocks. Just know it's well worth it. Even their imitation spicy crab is fantastic. We came in and ordered half pound of spicy mayo tuna and 1 lbs of spicy crab (this was a cheaper option just as good and more food) and a couple scoops of white rice in the side which were only .75 cents. It made for a great dinner. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I think the Poke Express moved out of this location and are only at the Craig Rd location. I go to the one at 655 West Craig Rd. North Las Vegas"}
{"text":"The freshest poke I've had. My personal favourite is the spicy avocado salmon. I usually get a half pound just for me. Great service and delicious poke!!!"}
{"text":"This place is all about the island grub, filled with Aloha, 
I was evan called \"Aunty\" 
I will be returning Thursdays for fresh poi and Fridays for fresh Kulolo. My husband was fascinated  (a non islander) with my conversation, he said he didn't understand a single word that was said, but he knew it was about the grub purchased. He is enjoying his poke as we speak."}
{"text":"Speaking as a person who has tried many of the trendy poke bowl/burrito restaurants in Vegas, it is very refreshing to see a traditional Hawaiian poke  place(actually marinated in various seasonings instead of having sauces placed on top), as it is one of very few. The full 5 stars and 450 reviews says a lot about this place, and I am here to add to the praise. This poke is absolutely delicious, plain and simple. And as much as I love the sushi burrito places, the fish here just tastes more flavorful and fresh; my favorites include the ahi tuna with spicy mayo and masago, and the ahi tuna with oyster sauce. Not to confuse people, this place is not a restaurant, it is a \"deli-type\" shop where they sell the poke by the pound, they offer rice with furikake and even ice if needed. The staff is very friendly and they let you sample whatever you'd like. Prices are a bit expensive, but it is well worth the quality. My only complaint is that this place is so far from me(about a 30 minute drive) and so it would be nice if they opened a shop more north. However, the food here is too wonderful and I am still happy to make the drive over!"}
{"text":"We had the ahi poke. Near as I can figure this is sushi with a Hawaiian twist. Tried the poke first, then with shoyu soy sauce. Wow! This was the first meal the wife and I had in our Vegas Yelp Tour 2012, and definitely the one I will try to recreate at home. Yep, it's a tad confusing to find and their system is not obvious. But, the folks are friendly, and worth the trip to the south side of town."}
{"text":"This place has the best poke in town. They let me try everything before I buy it. They have a big selection of poke. Their poke bowl is so yummy. The owner & staff are so friendly & the place is so clean. I'll definitely will b back. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Mahalo

Poke Express is such a convenient little to-go only shop serving a variety of fresh Poke options. I've been nearly ten times and my fish has been exceptional each time. 

Poke Express even allows you to sample the variety which is a double bonus!

The Kimchi cucumber is my go to! A little salty but I'm sure it's the base. I always get 1/3 approx $3

The 1/3 Poke usually ranges about $5-6 bucks depending what I order. 

TIP: They often sell rice #ImBoutThatLife

Definitely worth trying if your in NLV"}
{"text":"I've somehow never known about this place and it literally is right next to my nail salon down the street from my house so yes folks #fail.. however it's so delicious I have now eaten it two days in a row . 

I tried it initially during lunch time so I got one of their bowls , today I got it by the lbs and ate it with tortilla chips . 

This place is worth a drive if you're looking for good service and authentic poke I won't go into details as I'm sure my fellow yelpers have gone in depth with their reviews but I was helped by Clay and he made it a point to suggest I come in and ask to sample everything and essentially get lunch so this is definitely the type of place I want to support .. not to mention it's delicious .. Wasabi poke Just do it"}
{"text":"I wish there furikake taste better. Other then that service was fast and friendly. Food was delicious... I want more!"}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii and I've lived here in Vegas for 13 years and this is the ONLY place I get my poke from. It smells like home from the moment you walk into the little corner shop. My go-to pokes are Shoyu Ahi, Ahi with Limu, and Tako poke with Limu. I've also had their other pokes such as avocado, wasabi, and spicy mayo. Everything is ONO! The seafood is ALWAYS fresh, and if you're lucky you might even get your poke made to order. Besides poke, they also have some small Hawaiian goodies and foods like Diamond Crackers, Li Hing Mui candies, Zippys Chili, and frozen manapua along with other Hawaiian merchandise like shirts and hats. If you're on the other side of town, it's worth the drive to go out of your way to get authentic poke from here."}
{"text":"Yes, Poke Express is all that and a bag of chips!  Bringing the Husband here earned me some definite brownie points - we liked it so much that we returned twice within a week, despite us living all the way across town!

They have a generous selection of tuna poke, salmon poke, dried fish, and a bunch of other edible goodies that one would expect from a place like this.  

Upon entering, we were warmly greeted and took our time perusing they offerings.  When they learned it was our first time, they insisted we try their fish selection.  They wanted us to be sure we liked what we ordered and we happily obliged. 

Our first visit, we finally walked out with: 

* Ahi Poke Chile Water Style ($10.49/lb) - Tuna poke that is fresh, tasty, and with a bit of spice.  

* Spicy Salmon Poke ($9.99/lb) - I love spicy sauce that is mayonnaise-based with masago mixed in and they do this right! Yum!

* Ahi Poke Limu ($10.49/lb) - I slight mix-up in my order since I wanted the Spicy Tuna Poke, but decided to keep it nonetheless since we had already left.  Still tasty and fresh! 

* Raw Kim Chee Tako ($16.99/lb) - An acquired taste for those not too sure about raw octopus.  The Husband and I like this slimy concoction and they offer it two ways here.

Our return visit, we also added an order of:

* Top Shell Poke Kim Chee Style ($17.99) - These sea snails aren't for everyone with a slight rubbery texture.  

They will mix up the raw fish with whatever sauce they have, so it's pretty much mixed to order!

Poke Express is a deli of sorts, unfortunately there's no tables inside or out for eating right then and there.  But I'm sure you'll find a bunch of customers chowing down in their cars right in the parking lot, like us! 

Be sure to call ahead to find out when they close.  We came the week before Christmas, so the hours varied. They are also CLOSED on Wednesdays!  Also, they ran out of salmon poke during our order so ask to be sure about they have left if it's near the end of the day. They are located in the shopping center where Big Lots is!

Thank you yelpers for bringing me here! We'd probably be here everyday if it was closer...thank goodness it's not then!"}
{"text":"What an a AMAZING poke spot!!!!  Sooooooo authentic and delicious, you can tell that all these recipes are straight from Hawaii. Thee selection is unbelieveable and the staff is so nice  I highly recommend this place to any poke fans, you will not be Unsatisfied!"}
{"text":"So glad I finally got to try this place out. Plus it is close to where I live. I got the salmon special sauce poke and ahi Hawaiian with the ocean salad. Soooo good. I went 30mins to closing and the food was still really fresh. The guys were really nice. Diffently will be coming back. If I could eat fresh seafood all day I would."}
{"text":"Soooo ono!

Thank you for being here so I can still enjoy my local-kine-island-girl roots. haha. I have actually never been to the location, but my family picks up poke all the time from Poke Express and I have never been let down yet. All kinds of deliciousness coming from you."}
{"text":"Ah, so simple yet so good! Apparently there are quite a few Hawaiian food in Vegas and we happened to find this one before throwing away our money at the casinos. When we walked in, it was this tiny little shop with many different types of fish you can choose from. One of the workers was super helpful and nice and gave us samples to help us choose. There were definitely plenty to choose from including ahi tuna, salmon, mussels, octopus, etc. 

I love tuna. I LOVED their ahi tuna (both the avocado one and a regular one). If this shop was near where I worked or lived, I would eat this every other day. We also had the mussels in the sweet sauce. I normally don't eat mussels because the taste gets tiring after a few bites but I like it a lot! The octopus was also great. We ate it without the sauce but if you need a little more flavour, they can give you their house sauce. One other dish we ate was the salmon salsa which had salmon bits mixed with tomatoes. YUM!

Overall, love love love this place! We had rice to eat with our seafood and it was just perfect. We wanted to try different types of seafood so 1/3 lb of each fish was a good amount. The price here is so cheap compared to sushi restaurants (we don't actually have poke back home). With 2 drinks, rice, and 5 different kind of seafood, it was about $20. I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I truly love Poke Express. Even when they are super busy they try to work as fast as they can to help everyone. They are always helpful and willing to tell you about the different pokes. 

My favorite poke is the Salmon which comes with a special sauce. ( I always ask for the special sauce with all my poke.) Since the Salmon is so tasty of course all the people know it! So if you want it to you better get there early in the day. My other favorite Poke is the Hawiian or the Ahi Shoyu. Both of those have such flavor. 

Poke is great! Such a healthy meal! It tastes good, is full of protein and low in carbs. Score!"}
{"text":"If you like poke then you will love this place.  It's nice and clean with very friendly staff.   I tired the poke bowl with the chili, limu ahi poke and it was soooo good.  I also ordered some smoked ahi, wasabi poke and tako poke to go and they were all excellent as well.  

For now on, whenever I am in Vegas, I will definitely be stopping by this place"}
{"text":"Listen to all of us!! This place is the best around for fresh, quality poke. Feels like I'm in Hawaii grabbing some at the local shop. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"This location is so stealthy, but equally delicious! It's amazing to have fish like this in the middle of the desert. Don't forget the ocean salad to go with your ahi poke!"}
{"text":"So ono! Wonderful fish, wonderful service! I can't believe I didn't find out about this place sooner. I'm bummed they're closed tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Authentic & great tasting poke, if you're craving something from the islands.

Many different combinations but my top 3 are the ahi spicy mayo, kimchi w raw tako, & ahi with Hawaiian sea salt, shoyu, & limu."}
{"text":"Poke Express (here and the North location) is one of my favorite spots for some seafood. 

This is in a odd attachment to Island plate counter and Island Sushi. I normally want rice with my poke so this being with a plate counter is a plus. I can get a side of rice here and sit down whereas the other location I normally walk over to closeby Hawaiian place for rice and to sit or take it home. 

My favorite is the kimchee poke. It's not really spicy, but more like the flavor of kimchee. For something more classic, I favor the limu poke. 

Not sure what to get? Feel free to ask questions and ask for samples. 

Nom!"}
{"text":"This is not a gem, it is a diamond find for me.

Very simple and clean store with a few Hawaiian frozen,snacks and cold drinks on the right side of the store and a glass counter filled with items. Apparently once it hits past a certain time, they freshly make your poke as they don't want any poke to carry onto the next day (we were there about 3:30-4ish). We mention that we havent been there yet and she was like \" oh if you come back next time earlier you can sample all the pokes and proceeded to let us try a few ready made items- a marlin limu poke, just a plain tuna cube with shoyu to taste the shoyu sauce, and dried seasoned aku. . I really like the fact that she wanted everyone to try things out as theres so many goodies that sometimes it's hard to decide when you're new what to get.

The owners were very much what I love about Hawaii- friendly, talkative and genuine. Talked us up while we were waiting for our poke to be made. Mentioned that I found them online through a yelper's list and that they were getting shining 5 star reviews and he seemed real surprised and happy to hear it.  Very cool, humble island folks.

We decided on Ahi limu style and wasabe style and a ocean/seaweed salad. Quality is amazingly fresh and nicely seasoned so $9.99 for 1 lb of poke is a deal!  We had somewhere to be so we ate ours in the car....and yeah I'm such an Asian, I brought me a bowl of rice from home!! HAHAHA!

 It was fantastic flavors- the Limu had a light garlicky taste and I love the limu/red seaweed in it. The wasabe style was very lightly wasabi flavored, not too overwhelming on the palate but just a kick balanced with the shoyu sauce, fish and seasoning. 1 lb poke, half lb seaweed and some rice, we were full. Our total was $13. 

Other than 9 or so styles of ahi poke, they had salmon salad and poke and marlin limu poke (I think the salmon and marlin were \"seasonal\"),  tako/octopus and top shell/snail poke, cucumber kimchee, seaweed/ocean salad, dried aku/seasoned dried aku, dried marlin, pipikaula meat, few kinds tako salad, smoked tako, crab salad, tempura salad (looks like various fish and shrimp cakes). 

Again, it's a simple and wonderful diamond find. Definitely will be coming on a happy regular and wish this business lots of success. Will be sharing this find with poke fans.

 She mentioned her family is opening a Hawaiian restaurant next door soon...if it's on par with their poke then this will be the happening Hawaiian area!

UPDATE 7/11-

ONO like always! 

I've been wanting to go back since my first time, but it hasn't worked out to come back. Ouu limu and wasabe poke..still as good, consistently fresh fish. I heart this place. Wasn't feeling adventurous today, but I WILL try the tako and snail next time."}
{"text":"If there is ONE thing that I love, its raw fish!! People think it's weird that I only like my fish raw, not cooked..but damn, I feel like that's the way to GO! Poke Express is a Hawaiian Poke Deli shop. It almost has an Asian mart feel with lots of choices for those seafood lovers, baby! 

There IS more food than just poke, but I haven't tried them yet!! Still trying to cover the whole poke area of the store. ;P They have quite the selection!

It is located kind of in the corner of a shopping area, so you -really- have to look to see it! AND ya can't eat there because they don't have seats, so please just don't stand there and eat..that's weird! Go home!

The owner gives out great customer service! He tells everyone to come in at 10 AM to try free samples! He was also super friendly, patient, and helpful in explaining all of the food to my boyfriend, who had never eaten poke before :) Also, they do give a military discount here, which was pretty cool of them. 

The only two poke flavors that I have tried are the Hawaiian and Garlic poke, but I really loved both of them. The quality of the fish is excellent~ It's as fresh as it gets and delicious, too! The prices are pretty reasonable as well!

So if you want a taste of the Island, stop by Poke Express--it's a place to be!!!"}
{"text":"If you missed the poke from the islands this is the spot. Our friendly Lyft driver suggested it and drove from the strip all the way out to Henderson. Bought 3 kinda of Poke and all were great , they even fixed us up a fresh batch.  Will come again when I am back in Vegas! Mahalo"}
{"text":"This is the one place I must eat at whenever I'm in Vegas.  Once, I drove to Target to buy a cooler to take poke back home with me. lol. The old man behind the poke counter bagged it up and gave me a lot of ice for my drive home :)

My favorites are the spicy poke and the wasabi poke.. I wish there were poke places like this in LA.. I miss walking into a market in hawaii and just buying it off the deli counter.. for now, i either make it at home or try to get my fill whenever I'm in Vegas.

Oh, and order fried saimin to go.. you'll be happy after you come back to your hotel room drunk..  LOL"}
{"text":"Not to be a poke snob, but Poke Express is the best in town. From their small counter at a local Hawaiian joint to their own brand new location, Poke Express stills reign supreme and my first choice place to get poke. How lucky am I to have this place so close to where I live! 
Everything I've had from the ahi, salmon, taegu, mussels, or imitation crab is fresh and full of flavor! They even have section to buy Hawaiian brand products and groceries.

{"text":"Wow...  i love sushi and when i found this place on yelp, i knew i had to try it out.  i came to vegas for business and took a drive out here.  it's really hard to find because it shares a storefront with another hawaiian joint.  poke express is really just a deli type counter.  the man was really nice.  i asked if i can try one first.  he said, why don't you try them all.  at first, i thought he was being sarcastic, but he then gave me a sample of every single fish he had.  my favorite was the spicy tuna with avocado and the tuna with shoyu.  i bought 1/2 pound of both.  no regrets at all.  the fish is so tender and fresh.  omg, i have never eaten a whole pound of tuna in one day.  i am so happy i came here.  honestly, for the portion, i would expect to pay over $50 in new york., but this place charges $15.95 a pound,  my two containers were $19.  before i left, he asked me if i wanted to try the other stuff he had.  i politely said no, because he's just a small business owner and i don't want to eat him out of his profits.  but he's obviously really proud of his business.  this is the stuff of happiness - poke and a bowl of hot steaming rice."}
{"text":"\"I want to try poke (as in to jab or prod, pronounced p, long o, k)\" my Chi town poker bud tells on the way to the cashier holding racks of checks that once belonged to me.

\"Huh?\" I reply

\"Yeah, you know, poke, the raw fish stuff you guys from Hawaii eat\" he attempts to clarify.

\"I don't get it.  The hell you saying?\" I say looking like a confused dog with my head tilted to one side.

\"Poke made with fish, you know poke, poke, poke\" being totally serious as he jabs his finger into my side.

Yes, were talking ahi limu poke, wasabi shoyu poke, etc. 

Is it as good as back home?  No.  But it is prepared in a way that makes it more approachable to mainland taste.  Cultural sharing through food is a good thing.

The various selections of ahi poke are made from previously frozen fish.  The sauces are deeply flavored but since the fish is not fresh when marinated, the flavor does not permeate it, just coats the outside.  Limu (fresh, raw seaweed) is used very sparingly and lacks the texture and ocean flavor you would expect.  Several types of poke such as the raw salmon (with onion, green onion, soy, sesame oil and sesame seeds) and  ahi kim chee poke (exactly as it's name implies) are not traditional but taste surprisingly good.

Prices are high compared to Hawaii (about $12.50 per pound for frozen fish) but expected.  It's a poke shop in the desert after all.

Recommended for those wanting a taste of Hawaii or the Hawaii expat jonesing for a fix of home.

As for my bud, I never corrected his mispronunciation.  Payback for poking me in the side and bluffing me out of a huge pot."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to pick up poke. Staff there is always nice and never had anything bad. We always pick up the Spicy Ahi Poke and Shoyu Ahi Poke. It's always one place I go if I'm feeling homesick and craving Hawaii grinds!"}
{"text":"Sad that they are no longer serving poke at Island Flavor. I now have to drive even farther just to eat their food.  Every bite is worth it! All their flavors are amazing and delicious."}
{"text":"You will get your poke cravings satisfied here! Open up locations on Phoenix please, like all over PHX (Surprise, AZ to be specific)"}
{"text":"I just love poke. I can literally eat this everyday. And they have such a variety. Service is always quick and so nice..."}
{"text":"When my friends told me that the best Poke on the mainland comes from the desert of Las Vegas, I thought they were kidding.  How could it be?  Surely they were messing with me, I thought as my GPS took me through an industrial area of North Las Vegas.  Then like a mirage in the middle of the desert, I see a shopping center appear out of no where.  Located in the midst of the shopping center was Poke Express.  

As I entered, I was greeted by the workers working there.  When it was my turn, the girl helping me was great.  They had different flavors of Ahi and Salmon poke.  If fish isn't your thing, they also had octopus, mussels and seaweed salad.  As usual, with so many choices, there was no way that I would be able to pick.  But, it was okay, Just like Costco, they let me sample all of them.  They even offered me more when I couldn't make up my mind.  I ended up getting the Spicy Ahi Combo with avocado, cucumber and crab, and the Ahi Poke with sweet Chili sauce.  They had just ran out of rice when it was my turn, but, that was okay because I ordered more poke.  

The Poke, both the samples, and the two I ordered were great.  The fish was fresh.  The flavor was better than anything that I have ever had.  In Southern California, Pokinometry is the measuring stick for good poke.  The wrong standard is being used.  Poke Express is much better and should be the standard that all other Poke should be compared to when outside of Hawaii.  

Poke Express is better than all other Poke places I have been to.  Their friendliness and service is better than any of the places I've been to.  They may be a little far from the strip, but, it is worth the drive.  Believe it when someone tells you that the best Poke is found in Vegas.  Even though you might think that you are headed into some industrial area, you won't go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get Hawai'ian Poke in Vegas! 

What is Poke? It's a Hawai'ian appetizer made of fresh fish or any other edible items from the sea. There are a variety of options here from Ahi (tuna), mussels, Tako (octopus), seaweed salad, edamame, etc.

Great prices, you pay by weight. 

The container sizes are:
small = 1/4 pound
medium = 1/2 pound 
large = 1 full pound .... which are displayed on the counter above the poke.  

My family and I come here often. My faves are: 
- Kim Chee Mussels Poke
- Spicy Ahi Poke with Masago & Mayo
- Kim Chee Imitation Crab
- the cucumbers
- the Taegu
- oh...and I almost forgot the Seasoned Edamame! (my bad, silly me)

The Ahi Limu is pretty good too. Oh yeah...Trust me and try the seasoned edamame! Tastes buttery (it's probably sesame oil & shoyu) & it has a good amount of spice (red pepper), not too hot.

I have not tried everything there, but I will be back often to accomplish that! 

The guys at the counter always have the \"aloha spirit\" on. They are friendly and helpful. If you would like to sample any of the selections, just ask! And I love that they all have the pidgin accent. Makes me feel at home and ho brah, the pidgin is contagious! Every time I go here, I feel like I'm back home in Hawai'i. 

This place is at the top of my fave list for Hawai'ian food in Vegas.

The quality and service are on point, a well deserved 5 stars. 

Note: sometimes they run out especially if it's towards closing time, so come early if can for best selection!"}
{"text":"This place is practically in my backyard. I finally got around to trying them out this morning. I sampled the wasabi and it is my favorite. I also sampled the garlic which I'm sure my husband is sure to love. 

The salmon was quite good and I love a change of pace. I feel I will be coming back each week. Buy 5 lbs of ahi, you'll get a discount. Although I brought a cooler I couldn't fit everything in it. They were nice enough to give me a bag with ice for the tubs that wouldn't fit in the cooler. 

The employees are helpful and don't mind letting you try everything before you buy it."}
{"text":"i grew up in HAWAII and a trip to POKE EXPRESS was a very special treat.

we stopped by and loaded up on lots of tasty nibbles -- SHOYU AHI POKE, SPICY AHI POKE, MUSSEL POKE (KIMCHEE style), SALMON POKE with special sauce and TAKO POKE (KIMCHEE style). still one of my all time favorites, PIPIKAULA, a teriyaki flavored HAWAIIAN-style beef flank steak jerky.

hauled everything back to the \"resort casino\" where we're staying and filled the mini-fridge. 

happy, happy, happy. 

life is very, very good indeed !!!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Easy 5 stars!

Most important thing....the seafood is nice and fresh.  The tuna was super tender and cut well.  The octopus was the same....nice and tender, not chewy or tough.

The seasonings were great!  We had 3 different kinds...the wasabi and two others.

The wasabi one was amazing...but beware, if you don't LOVE wasabi, some bites are super concentrated and tickled my \"wasabi experienced\" nose.  Still great!  It was made to order, and not sitting in pans all day, so I know it wasn't due to that.

I forgot the other two varieties already, since we got to sample a bunch of them while we are there, I kind of just ordered off the hip lol.

But the octopus had some spice to it as well...very good.  Might have been the kim chi one...And we had one more tuna, in another spicy concoction....a mayo / yum yum sauce looking mix.  It was white overall....and super good.  This was probably my favorite one of the 3.

Service was cool, and it was nice for them to give us plenty of samples and recommendations to try.

It is a little spendy...I think I spent about $30 for 2lbs of meat, but the quality and taste is well worth it.  Save me from an AYCE sushi splurge every once in a while lol.

Really wish they had a sit down area or sold rice to enjoy it on site, but for now, this is an excellent take out spot.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have tried so many poke places in California, but nothing will ever compare to this small shop in Vegas (as of yet). I couldn't believe it myself that this place would've been 5 stars with so many reviews but it's true!! 

Their fish is so amazingly fresh. You have to try their spicy mayo salmon, shoyu salmon, and kimchee tako. Unfortunately they do not serve rice... So my boyfriend and I walked over to the teriyaki place next door and shamelessly bought white rice just to savor our yummy poke !"}
{"text":"I hope I never go to Vegas again without stopping to get a Poke to go! Five stars because I don't want to be the person who lowers this place's perfect score."}
{"text":"Fresh poke that tastes great. Friendly and charming owner. I'd give it a whirl."}
{"text":"This place is freaking deeeeee-licious! The fish is so flavorful and fresh. Staff is super nice every time! My favorite is the spicy mayo tuna and spicy furikake tuna. They do a poke plate lunch special. Also, they sell other Hawaiian goods in there. The only down side is that you can't dine in. Carry out only."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this spot yet?!? 

I have been coming here for years- like 7 or 8. It's my go-to poke spot in the entire LV valley. The fish is ALWAYS so fresh. They generally make most of it per order,  but they do have some in the case or photos of it on the display case.

BUT..... E V E R Y T H I N G is fantastic. You really can't go wrong with anything you choose. It's VERY fresh fish. It's super clean inside, too. They have a nice tank you can look at, but please do not touch and disturb it's residents :)

Customer service has never once been even remotely questionable. They are so friendly. I enjoy coming in here and supporting this north town staple. I appreciate that they make my poke with the sauce on the side!!

My favorites are: salmon, Hawaiian style and wasabi. Can't forget the kimchi mussels too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oh. Em. Gee. 
Oh poke where have you been...I have missed you and I did not even know I needed you in my life. With true lust....I went back again today, two days after my first visit. The only reason that I waited....yesterday was X-mas ;)

I have been thinking for a few days now where in this dessert besides whole foods would have tuna (that was safe to eat raw!) to make spicy tuna salad at home. Then I saw in passing one of the many Hawaiian joints in this town, yelped around...and viola...poke!!!!!! 

Narrowing down the options...I landed here, Poke Express. Thankfully I had torn through enough reviews to understand I just needed to go straight to the back of the restaurant as soon as you enter Island Sushi to place your order.

On both visits the case was filled with what looked to be their complete offering. Of course today a little after 12p the pans were only 1/3rd full since it was the day after being closed for the holiday. Probably 8 different poke (pokes? pokies?) ahi, spicy ahi with masago, spicy ahi combo with avocado and cucumber, salmon, ahi Hawaiian (the very nice counter woman said it was their version of poke without limu), kim chee mussels, 1 or 2 kinds of tako/octopus. All have been named in previous reviews plus seaweed salad, edamame, et cetera. 

Both visits I walked away with a 1/2 pound of each spicy ahi and Hawaiian. Totals each time was $16 and change for a smidge over a pound of ahi. Maybe I could find tuna at the grocery fish counter for the same cost, but why? This was so so good, run do not pass go. But maybe than again you shouldn't go...leave more for me."}
{"text":"The ahi poke they have here is always a hit. Always freshly made and the service here is always good. If you're looking for an authentic poke place here it is because it is rare to find out here in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love POKkkkEeeee!!!! Every since I left Hawaii I thought I'll never get to eat good POKE...But nOw i found it! I'm from LA but I will make my visit to get some POKE. I didn't know POKE can be so addicting! They have different kind of POKe...Must try! I heard the other location have more choices. I'm gonna try that place next time."}
{"text":"Went to the Poke Express 10:00 am on a Sunday morning. The owner tells me that by the afternoon, all of the stuff in the glass is normally empty so if you want to try samples, its only in the morning. Overall, the poke was awesome and pretty darn fresh considering this place is in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"Excellent. ..nothing left to say. ..best poke I've had since Hawaii...fresh and full of flavor.. if you've never had poke, this is the place to start. ..you won't have to go anywhere else"}
{"text":"After being turned off by the increase buffet pricing from a recent Vegas, we decided to check this second location this past weekend instead. Just as good as their other shop (maybe better!). Went ahead and tried the spicy Ahi Furikake, spicy Avocado Poke (ahi) and tako Kimchi. Even though we came in the afternoon, all of the food was still fresh. If you're not sure what you want, ask for a sample! Excellent customer service here.

Also had a sample of their frost ice cream they just got from Hawaii and it was really good too. If we had a fridge back at our hotel I would have definitely bought a couple."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I came at the recommendation of my new friend Elizabeth.

It's located in a small strip mall inside Island Sushi Grill. It's not on the strip, but there are two locations, both a little bit of a drive from the airport, and downtown Vegas, respectively. The airport one (this one) is the original, and supposedly is better!

Don't let the small counter and semi-empty looking trays fool you. After 1pm, everything is made to order, so just ask if they still have what you are looking for.

We got:
Ahi tuna poke with limu - Not too much flavor. Meh
Ahi tuna poke with shoyu - Mm.. classic poke flavor
Ahi tuna poke furikake style - This one is quite good too!
Salmon poke with house sauce - An interesting twist to the usual tuna poke

Prices are quite reasonable for poke. You can get poke in 1/4, 1/2 lb, and possibly other sizes larger than that. We got 4 1/4 trays, combined with a lunch special from Island Sushi Grill, and that split amongst 3 people was quite enough.

Definitely will come back if I'm in Vegas again and I have a car."}
{"text":"This location is fairly new since they moved from Island Sushi's restaurant. I am actually happy that they have their own complete individual location here, whenever I want poke I just stop by to get my fix. Due to the high volume and demand this poke shop has I would recommend you placing a phone order first so that you ensure you have your poke reserved and set for you once you arrive. Each time I come in my top favorites are: spicy tuna, kimchee shrimp, and kimchee crab salad! So good and it is the closest taste to home for me. The workers are great too, they always show Aloha."}
{"text":"Their Poke reminds me of the stuff on Maui, its very fresh and marinated perfectly.  We can't wait to go back when we're in vegas again.  BTW the same name poke place on Eastern was not even close in taste as this location, don't know what happened at that spot.  But this place is a gem of a find just a ways away from the strip.  Oh and its take out only no where to sit to eat the grindz."}
{"text":"An absolute must-have stop in Vegas every time I'm out there. I've had some amazing poke before (including in Hawaii) but this place is so much better than the rest. My personal favorite is the ahi poke with furikake and the salmon with the special house sauce.

Located in a small strip mall across from Gold's Gym and situated inside Island Sushi grill. Don't let the small counter set up deceive you, this place has a lot of options and it is super fresh. Everything is made to order after 1pm so if you don't see what you want, just ask :) There isn't a lot of seating since this place is pretty small. I would say no groups more than 4 and it's perfect for take out.

So....who wants to go to Vegas for a poke pig out session?"}
{"text":"I can't say I understand the hype. I had the basic limu poke (the best way to judge a poke place, imo!), and I wasn't all that impressed. The fish was relatively fresh, but the poke itself wasn't great. I've had fabulous poke in Hawaii and I've had fabulous poke here in Vegas at Hawaiian Style. I wish this place was half as good as Hawaiian style because it's right by my house, but I'll make the drive to Hawaiian style next time! The fish is fresher and the flavors are so much brighter. Try the garlic poke at Hawaiian style with the beautiful tiny diced red onions and I dare you to compare!"}
{"text":"This place deserves all the praise it recieves. Service really is amazing and down to earth. I've been here before and all times the service is kind and helpful. If you're not sure what to get they offer samples and explain differences between pokes. Everything is fresh and extremely tasty. Pricing is fair for Poké and honestly I'd rather pay 15 for a pound then 10 at other poke places for a massive amount of rice and little amount of poke (but that's just me) Wish I asked what the gentleman and woman's names were to give them a shoutout for their great service. The lady who gave off aunty vibes was extremely friendly with my daughter and gave her candy. They accept cash, most major credit cards and EBT/SNAP this is the only poke place I know that accepts EBT. 10/10 Recommend"}
{"text":"Ever since we started driving to Las Vegas, we have made Poke Express our first stop before checking into our hotel."}
{"text":"Awesome Food!! And customer service!! Will definitely order from here again! When I want poke I just know where to Go!!! I had the Hawaiian poke, and the octopus both so delicious, the closest of Hawaiian poke is no other spot Than here!!! The employees were nice, and if you come early you can try a sample or 2!!"}
{"text":"Was on Vacation here in North Las Vegas.  I tried this place once and went back almost everyday.  The Hawaiian sushi was so awesome.  Never got sick of it or from it. Owners (from Hawaii) are excellent (so friendly).  They take GREAT care in not only taste,quality of food, but in making sure its fresh and clean from any food born bacteria.  I trust this place for freshest HIGH QUALITY sushi around. Straight from Hawaii.  I can't wait to go back to visit in NLV, I really miss the food there. Carryout only.  But really worth it.  Reguards to the Owners for doing it Right.  Mahalo"}
{"text":"It's always hard to find a good poke place.  I know here in California I have to jump through hoops and drive distances away just for some good poke.

While I was in Vegas, my friend suggested Poke Express.  They have a display full of several kinds of poke.  There's also a display of the different kinds of poke they offer, so if it's not on display, ask, and they may have it in the back.

I tried the spicy ahi and wasabi poke.  The spicy ahi definitely has a kick.  But I don't like sauce on my poke, and this was my friend's choice.  What I did like was the wasabi poke.  Definitely has the potential to clear out your sinuses, so beware.  The wasabi is for sure in there.  I loved it.  The fish tasted pretty fresh, and the flavor was on point.  I will very likely be coming back here to get my poke fix again.

I also tried their Saimin Deluxe.  It's a huge bowl with all the fixings.  So good on a colder day.  In addition, the spam and egg masubi was a great snack to take with me before I went clubbing that night.  Not too much rice or sauce, so I could actually taste the spam and egg.  Glad, because some places love to just pile that stuff on!!"}
{"text":"I was a little sad when I found out that they moved a bit further from me, but it was made up when I realized it's just them located there which is nice.  Usually when I go they aren't as busy as they were when we went today. Though I get it, it's the day of the fights so everyone had to get their poke fix on. 
I ordered a pound and a half of the spicy ahi with mayo and every time I order they never disappoint!! They were pretty busy, but they had their line moving pretty fast. I had to wait for my order to be made because they were out, but to my surprise I didn't wait that long (I'd say 3 minutes or so...) Till this day they don't disappoint!  

*** FOR MY HAWAI'I PEOPLE: YES YES YES to their poke! They do carry other Hawai'i products as well, even the guri guri cups!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place! So where should i start ? They have DELICIOUS POKE!
My favorite one was the spicy mayo salmon, The spicy Ahi and the salmon with avocado poke. The service was excellent! I wish they had a location in Summerlin, but when I am in the area ill be sure to stop by again!"}
{"text":"First time going here, the employees were super nice and informative. Encouraged me and my girlfriend to try as many different pokes as we wanted. Everything tasted super fresh and looked the same way. I think we found our new favorite spot for traditional poke. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best poke in Vegas.
Just like home.
If you don't live near one of their 2 locations...drive. It's worth it."}
{"text":"I LOVE POKE EXPRESS! ( I wish we had one in Houston, TX)

All the poke here is fresh and there are a variety of flavors to please all palettes.
There are light combinations, savory, and traditional. You are allowed to sample everything before you buy it which is really great in my opinion because all though some of the poke look similiar they all have different tastes.

I came in with a girlfriend Thursday for lunch. We tried the ahi and avocado spicy furikake, the wasabi flavor, the spicy mayo one, and  a few others. You can order them by the 1/3 pound, 1/2 pound and so on. We ordered rice on the side separately and they serve it nice and warm with seaweed and sesame seeds sprinkled on top. 

The fish is super fresh and cut up in huge bite size cubes. Of all the poke I have had this place really takes the cake in the amount of freshness and size offered. 
We got about 4 different flavors 1/3 and 1/2 pound and shared them.
It was so good we came back again the next day before our road trip to LA."}
{"text":"This place is like home away from home! I love the Poke, Taegu, Spicy Tako Poke, Cucumber Kimchi!!! Whenever I miss home food this is one of the places that I stop by to eat!"}
{"text":"How come I've only been to this place once? I am so glad this location is close to work. I will definitely be around more often. I came around 11:30 with two of my co workers and surprisingly it was empty. Well, I spoke too soon because 5 mins after came the lunch hour rush. The store itself is small, so it'll fill up quickly. Unfortunately, there are no where to sit. So, it's a grab and go type of place. They have not only poke but several local products available. Definitely a plus. I was so excited as there was so much poke to chose from. The prices were all reasonable. The fish was fresh. I got the spicy Ahi, Ahi Limu and seaweed salad. I can definitely say it didn't disappoint. The fish just melted in your mouth and bursted with flavor. I loved the fact that they offered different sizes. From 1/3 to 1 lbs Tupperware's. I got half pound of the spicy Ahi and the ahi limu and it was plenty. I had enough for the next day. The next day I ate it for lunch and it was just as good and fresh! 

The store is clean. The staff is super friendly. They offered samples and they answered our million questions."}
{"text":"There is not much to say about this place because poke sells itself. Just try it. It's authentic, they have a huge variety and... Just try it. I would recommend that you go early because they tend to run out if the good stuff later on in the day. It's amazing. I'm haole so the first time I went in there the guy behind the counter was really helpful in explaining different pokes. He even let me taste test. I'm obsessed with this place. Just try it."}
{"text":"I went here since I was craving some fresh tuna and it's close to home. They have a lot of options: spicy, Hawaiian, wasabi, octopus (tako), crab, imitation crab, shrimp, salmon. There also also garlic bulbs, edamame and kimchi. They have Hawaiian goodies such as Hawaiian popcorn, chocolate covered macadamia nuts, lihing powder, crackers, guava jelly, etc.

I got a pound each of their wasabi ahi, spicy salmon and Hawaiian ahi - per the boyfriend's request. They gave me a free tub of wasabi ahi! The ahi and salmon were so fresh (not mushy and gross) and packed with flavor.  A pound of fish is about $14.  The wasabi ahi can clear your sinuses without a problem.  The spicy salmon isn't spicy at all - it has a mildly spicy mayo and masago.  Everything was soooo delicious!

I had to make rice for the boyfriend since they don't serve rice at Poke Express - which isn't a big deal to me since rice is easy to make and I don't even eat rice.  They don't have tables and chairs - it's mainly a to-go place.

The owners (husband and wife) were nice and very friendly. We were talking about baskteball and that sealed the deal for me! Good conversation + excellent food = happy customer who definitely will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"This location has now moved into the EOS gym shopping center off of Stephanie & 215.   The poke place inside island sushi is NOT poke express anymore. I realized after I tried the poke in the back of island sushi \"remodel\" and it tasted different.  Nothing can compare to Poke Express.  The fish taste so fresh!  Tons of new poke places popping up but nothing can compare to the original Hawaiian poke."}
{"text":"Tip:  this is a HAWAIIAN poke place.  This is the real deal folks.   Owner straight from the 808.  

If your looking for the fancy new poke burritos, poke bowl, whatevs, this is not it.  

This is traditional OG Hawaiian style poke, just like from the islands.   

I can appreciate the difference between this and the new hype on poke trend.  This is not the mainland version, again TRUE HAWAIIAN STYLE POKE 

Ok. Now that we got that outta the way.   If you haven't tried real Hawaiian poke.  You should.  Because your missing out!!    They used to be located inside island sushi on eastern,   But they have now moved to this new location on Stephanie.   Please do not get it confused with the poke in island sushi.  They are not the same.   

I cannot say enough about how ono the poke is here!  Always so nice and always showing your aloha spirit.  

Hawaii no ka oi!"}
{"text":"Bristol Farms used to have the best poke. Sadly, they have been dethroned!!! I say that for selfish reasons as now, if I wanna enjoy the most scrumptious poke ever, it'll take a four-and-a-half hour car drive as opposed to a thirty minute one.

Don't believe me?! You can hit the pool party later cause you know your phat ass is hungry anyway. Plus, it's November n cold as heck. Nobody at the pool n Bubba gonna be on turtle status.

We had the spicy, limu, n wasabi styles ahi poke. My favorite was the wasabi. Helped me keep from pluckin dem long nose hairs cause they was on fire! That was a compliment. LOL peeps inside were hella cool too!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from HI and I must say that this is the best poke spot I have ever been to! The price is better than HI prices and the quality is just as good, if not, BETTER than home. I can't tell you how amazing this place is. The product and customer service speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Love this place. There is no place to dine in and it is more like deli style but if you are looking for the best poke go here!!!! Great prices and a wonderful taste of the islands"}
{"text":"Really like that place!!!

Cheap, Healthy, Tasty, great variety (best in Vegas by far) and super conveniently located for Anthem/Green Valley locals. 

We REALLY need more good and Healthy Local spots like this in our neighborhood I am freakin tired of Wendy's and other chains...

Very Friendly service.

BUT Closing time is way too early around 6pm... Perfect for an healthy lunch but not recommended for dinner, too bad, I would love some Poki on my way back from work

My favorite: furikaki poki, kim Chi cucumbers, Salmon Poki with special sauce, Ocean (seaweed salad), Dried fish slices (can't remember the name)
The pieces of Tuna are cut a little bit too big for my taste but nothing that a sharp knife cant fix.

Also they mentioned that the Tuna is previously frozen unfortunately but it actually taste very very fresh. Extremely surprising.

The prices are also surprisingly low for the quality of the food, you would pay 20 times more in any sushi/seafood restaurant by the Strip.
Definitely a great value for what you get.

There is a Hawaiian grill in the exact same location that stay open later (10pm I think)
and I would highly recommend their stir fried saimin noodles and the oxtail soup with freshly grated ginger and cilantro.

Their coconut flan is pretty good too, one of my fav dessert of all time but in my opinion you cannot go wrong with coconut anyway ;)

Their assortment of cakes behind the window look Absolutely delish and beautiful, I have too look away every single time! 

I didnt like their homemade kim chi that much taught... Its not bad but I had better.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is not scared of raw fish and that is looking for a healthy yet tasty meal.

Very close from the LVAC on eastern and 215 :)"}
{"text":"Insanely fresh, authentic, and delicious. Great variety and amazing customer service. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So glad they move to Henderson. It's so hard to find good grinds here in this town. Takes me back to my childhood everytime I stop by. The food is always fresh and if they don't have they make it for you. Everyone always so friendly.  Just try I'm sure you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"The place is inside of island grill so if you keep looking for their own place forget it just go in.  I called and they told me that they were inside. Hen when you walk up you see on the other door poke express.

You just go to the area and order your poke you can pay the cashier there or put it on your plate lunch tab.

Crazy but I didn't like the  mochiko chicken it didn't have any flavor or sauce with it.  The poke was okay but my husband loves it.  The Kalbi beef looked pretty good but the place is not plentiful and the fried saimen (noodle) is not tasty kind of bland.  

The four is for poke island grill would get a 5.  The price was higher and you don't get alot of food plus it didn't taste to my tastebuds.  But maybe other people would love it so don't go by what I say give them a chance."}
{"text":"I cannot express how amazing and wonderful it was to have wandered into this place! I needed to go to FedEx right next door, but, I was starved. I walked in... and was totally surprised.

The sweet girl helping me was so nice and thoughtful enough to encourage me TASTE everything that was out since that is a unusual occurrence (typically all the fish is in the back being prepared). I tasted it all, and I'll have to say... I was FULL! lol

I took the rest of my Poke I purchased (the garlic btw) and saved it for dinner. It was OUTSTANDING! All the fish is fresh and unique. The service is great, and the location is easy to get to. I will be returning religiously!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm able to stop by here, I do. Everything is always fresh and flavorful. I've tried many of their menu items and am always pleased with the quality of the fish. 

Today, I got a quarter pound of ahi limu poke and a quarter pound of ocean salad (seaweed salad). This was my first time getting the limu but I'm glad I did. The fish was fresh, it was seasoned well, and the limu added a nice texture to the poke. The ocean salad was, as always, good quality and really tasty. Pricing is really reasonable and they sometimes have half pricing at the end of the day if there are a lot of leftovers. 

The shop has options for poke by the pound and also poke bowls. They also have lots of Hawaiian goodies like li hing candies and Hawaiian Sun drinks. Staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"It is a touch confusing how this whole establishment works. Within this small area you have three businesses running simultaneously alongside each other. The front part is a grill where you can get Saimin and oxtail soup. In the back, poke is king. To the right you can enjoy sushi and it is AYCE, if you please. 

I had only tried the Poke Express and it was well worth it. On Monday and Tuesday, poke is 10.49 for one pound and 9.99 for two pounds or more. The poke they have upfront are heavy on the kimchee style. Got a pound of the mussel kimchee poke. It was choke full of salty mussel goodness with little filler consisting of onions and cucumber. Also got a pound of the spicy ahi poke. The nice pieces of tuna was tossed in a mayo based sauce. Not my favorite, but it was good. The masago gave it a little pop with each bite. The ahi pokes are not set out in the case, instead they are tossed in your choice of sauce when you order."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY IMPRESSED ! 

Coming from the island not too long ago, I don't think I could find anything closer to the real thing. I wasn't expecting too much in a hot dry desert, but I was blown away. 

It's kinda hard to find because its located inside another store \"island sushi and grill\". Walk straight to the back and you'll see the poke in a glass case like the fresh seafood section of a grocery store. The fish was fresh, tasty, and there's an assortment of flavors sold by the pound. My favorite was the Hawaiian. 

Everything I tasted was amazing, my only wish was that I could buy a side of rice so I could mix it and eat everything! 

Staff is friendly, seating is limited. 
This is a must go!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed. They only serve poke by the pound & serve a sort of poke bowl between 10 to 2. Store was clean, smelled fresh and the server was nice, food looked good but not what we wanted."}
{"text":"I love trying new things and heard about Poke Express. This place is pretty out there for me in terms of what I am used to. I tried the Mussels Kim Chee style, Baby Octopus and some sort of Salmon Ceviche. All of the items were fresh and while the only thing I personally enjoyed was the Mussels, all of the items that Poke Express had looked interesting. They will make Ahi fresh and cut it when ordered. They also offer other items which are presented in a convenient store setting. I will be definitely going back for different things to try. The prices are fair and you can make a mix of anything they offer. I am so glad I found this place."}
{"text":"The shrimp kim Chee is the business you will love it. Everything I ordered was good and fresh. Great locals."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm so glad we decided to follow all these yelp reviews!!! It was my husbands and my first time at Poki Express and the girl at the counter, (sorry, I didn't get your name) was super nice and asked if we wanted to sample everything! We tried it all and I can't say anything bad about anything we tried because they were all good. Everything tasted so fresh! We ended up getting the garlic ahi poki with shoyu, spicy wasabi ahi (my FAVE), ahi poke with oyster sauce and an ocean salad. I'm surprised we made it home with 3 of the 4 left! Lol. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"YES, poke for the win.

The reviews are true. This place is great. If you are a sushi addict and want to try something a little different go for the poke. Had both the salmon with special sauce and the tuna with spicy avocado. Both large chunks of super fresh fish in large portion for the price and addictive sauces. This is going to be my new addiction. And for those not so sure about poke the shop is attached to Island Sushi for your regular sushi cravings. 

Be warned: we went to this place around noon on a weekday and it was PACKED and a little bit chaotic. There were people everywhere looking for a table, waiting for food at tables, waiting for to-go orders. The people working there were all very nice and friendly and it seemed to be going pretty fast. They are clearly used to the rush. Also, really nice that you can just order and pay for to-go poke-only orders at the deli counter, thus bypassing the longer main order line."}
{"text":"What else can you say about Poke Express that hasnt already been said? It is hands down the best poke in Vegas. 

It is always quick, always fresh, super delicious. The fish is always high quality and the staff is always friendly. I wish they were open later than 6pm (PLEASE!) as a dinner option, but still the best lunch and take-out you can get. Get in before 2pm to get the lunch poke bowl special."}
{"text":"I am amazed at the selection of fresh fish at Poke Express. I read the Ninth Island email last week and was intrigued that a place like this even existed. I have only had \"poke\" on an appetizer from the Yard house. After viewing the pics and reading the reviews I decided to trek on over since it was only about a 15 minute drive from my house. In my eyes, poke is sashimi with sauces, and this place does it right! First of all, the service is so friendly, they encourage you to sample everything they have. The guy behind the counter was so nice it was like talking to a long lost friend, so laid back. Secondly, the value of the poke is unbelievable!!! If you compare it to the price of sashimi, this place is a steal!!! I also saw little plastic sashimi containers (similar to what I buy at Whole foods) for about half the price that Whole Foods charges. Now for the 3rd reason I stand in awe of this place: the taste!!! 

Spicy Ahi Poke: Yummy small bits of the freshest Ahi ever, mixed in a spicy mayo/masago sauce. Eating this reminded me of when I was a kid and would eat Cool Whip by the spoonful. It just gets better with every self-indulgent sinful bite. 

Ahi Poke Kim Chee style: Spicy Kim chee tasting ahi, with crunchy bits of cool cucumber that made a perfect balance. 

Tako Poke Kim Chee style: My favorite of them all...The octopus was the absolute perfect texture. It was cut in precise thin strips and the flavors all worked together harmoniously. 

Tako Poke Limu: This was also a tasty find, the flavors were much more muted than the kim chee style, but the crunchiness of the onion slivers and sea weed combined with the sauce to make this a delightful treat. My 6 year old stole this one from me and nearly polished off the half pound container by herself. 

I LOVE this place...so much that I think I'm going to go there this afternoon again!!!"}
{"text":"Found out that poke express has another location in Henderson. I had been going out on Davis in north Las Vegas and was very pleased to find this newer location. 
I can tell you the Henderson store is very similar to nlv store. More choices than I have seen before and each type I try I love. Great Hawaiian vibe, clean, fresh and at a fair price. I travel from Laughlin 90 miles to visit at least once a month and more if I can. 
If you like Hawaiian food Poke is right up your alley. Their Poke is 'ono and will make your tummy hau'oli."}
{"text":"Probably not much more I can say here that others haven't. Awesome poke, cool
Dude working there.  Has the Tako and furikake poke with rice. The best I have ever had.  I will remember this place. Can't believe they have this in Vegas. Amazing."}
{"text":"Oh yes! talk about variety and the prices weren't bad at all! It felt like I was back in Hawaii. We ordered practically everything that was in the show case. 12 different items including their kulolo poke- which is chunks of kulolo with coconut milk mixture and the Kimchee raw crab. Need my fix again so we will be heading back to LV for our cravings."}
{"text":"I kinda OVER did my Poke experience. I Loved the ahi and the various flavors and choices.

Will be back once I have gotten over my Overdose of this delectable joint!"}
{"text":"What can I say if you're a fan of pokey you will absolutely love Pokey Express. Always an awesome selection of tuna,octopus,muscles etc. Seaweed salad is delicious and the pickled onions too. 
They also carry our favorite drink....Hawaiian Sun. You can also purchase Soy sauce, Huli Huli sauce, furi kake and other condiments and dry goods. 
Please if you love Poke you must try Poke Express!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  If you love Sushi, especially Sashimi, you will love this place.  Great quality food and great customer service.  You need to check this place out.  If you're not sure what you'll like, they do provide samples.  So far, everything has been YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I have never been disappointed with the quality and freshness of the poke selections!  Service is always excellent and the store is clean!!!  Only bad thing if any is they are closed on Wednesday and they close early daily...I believe it is 6 pm.  Today I opted for a pound of shoyu poke, cucumber Kim chew, tako poke....yum!  A poke fest for lunch! :). Hope this place continues to do well and stays open for us Hawaii people in Vegas."}
{"text":"I swear this place has a tractor beam that knows when I'm within a one mile radius from the building because every time I'm near, something takes over my steering wheel and parks me right in front of Poke Express at Stephanie and Paseo Verde. I think I've been making a stop at least once a week for a couple months now. Each and every visit I have been satisfied.

Everything I've tried from the clams, to the mussels, to the tako has been excellent, but I've been taking a liking to the wasabi ahi and the salmon poke with ponzu. I don't usually use any wasabi at all when I eat sushi, but the sinus clearing wasabi just goes with this poke. The ponzu with the salmon is another combination that I'll always come back for. 

If you have any liking of poke in the slightest, you're sure to find something. If you can't decide, the employees are always friendly and will let you sample anything you'd wish. The ahi and salmon pokes will run about $15/pound and the other selections will be $6-$10 a pound. A scoop of rice is $.75. Around $10, will get me two 1/3 pound containers which is just the right amount for lunch for me and an outstanding bargain.

This is where it's at for poke in Las Vegas. I don't need all the other fillers and distractions that come with some of these poke bowls. Just give me my fish and my rice."}
{"text":"Best poke place in Vegas! The staff is very helpful too. I love that the store is well kept always clean! I suggest the wasabi ahi poke!!"}
{"text":"Amazing poke and staff is so friendly and helpful. We had the wasabi and avocado poke with rice and fried noodles on the side. Fresh and so flavorful. A go to if you're in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"Just as great as the location in Craig and closer to me!!!! Quality of the poke is so fresh and they have a great variety to choose from. Love that have have the poke bowl option with rice and a choice of 1 or 2 poke varieties. My favorite is always the spicy ahi mayo. The customer service is great polite and fast. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Got our poke on for the Super Bowl in Las Vegas by getting poke from Poke Express.  We were very pleasantly surprised to find poke as good as home.  Spicy ahi was great.  We also ordered the salmon poke and the oyster sauce.  Next year we will definitely go back and order ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Love love love, this place! Products are so delicious and fresh, employees are extremely friendly and attentive. Can say more for this place, I'm addicted. They have to deal with me now cuz I'm a regular from now and so forth!

Spicy Ahi: Flavor is like heaven, ahi is perfect buttery and melt in your mouth perfection!

Garlic Ahi witg shoyu: Literally the most delicious thing I have put in my mouth... I can't explain this one, ya'll need to come down and try it yourselves. You won't regret it...

Poke express is a little gem hidden from tourists on craig rd, and I love them even more for this."}
{"text":"This place has it all. At the express you can find, mussels kimchi, tako poke, ahi poke with all the different sauces like mushu, spicy poke, avocado poke and the list can go on. You have to go here and yes they sell by the pound so it can get a bit pricy but its worth the money for some fresh Poke!!!!"}
{"text":"They always have great service with a smile and awesome food! It's a weekly favorite for me and my coworkers! 

Try the spicy ahi combo and the seaweed salad they are the best! Keep up the good work guys, we'll always be back for MORE!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place! Close to my mother-in-laws house so I had to stop by and grab a pound of spicy mayo poke! Sooo good! The ocean salad was amazing too! My son loved the frozen treats!"}
{"text":"Having just come back from Maui earlier this year....this place is legit!  The fish is extremely fresh and I'm in LOVE with the furikake ahi poke....yes this is the bomb diggity!! It's so delicious, that I even ate the onions that come with it...generally I avoid the onions but the marinade soaks into the sweet onions and it doesn't even taste like an onion anymore.  I also tried the shoyu ahi poke which was also delicious, but I like the hint of sweetness with the furikake.  I thought to myself I can probably make this....so I headed over to Greenland the next day to check out fish prices....$25.99/lb for ahi there....the price for ahi at poke express $15.99/lb....on second thought, I'll let Poke Express keep my belly full and happy.  Some places also give you big chunks of onions and charge you for that instead of big chunks of fish...but not this place. They also have poke bowl specials Monday/Tuesday until 2pm.  If you haven't been here, you NEED to go!"}
{"text":"My visit was amazing. Cashier was really nice and the quality of the Poke was great. The price is good compared to other Poke places around the LV area. I ordered the Poke Bowl with white rice and it was good. The furikake atop the rice was good and it had a wonderful smell to it. The rice was nice and hot and my overall experience was amazing."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the location after a doctors appointment and after reading the reviews I decided to stop here for lunch. 

The inside is more of a poke market with some dry and canned goods along with some Hawaii apparel. 
No seating available. 

Now, on to the poke. I am not Hawaiian, but first tried poke when visiting Oahu and I was immediately hooked! 

I ordered the Hawaiian style poke bowl with two scoops of sticky rice. Oh my god, amazing!!!!
The fish is so fresh and the flavor was not overly salty either. Great portion size; I am a bodybuilder so this is a perfect on the go meal that fits into my macros.

Great service and they offer a military discount too!

I will definitely be back more often, I guess I need more excuses to visit my doctors office."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because service was good, long story short me and my husband ended up getting food poising, an hour after eating here we both got sick. Which is unfortunate because it's right around the corner from our house and we love poke! Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Poke by the pound!

This is a place for takeout....let's get first things first. Secondly the Poke variety is impressive with at least 8 different kids. Maybe there's more, but I lost count. I purchased Ahi Lima Poke, Ahi Poke Hawaiian Style, and Garlic Ahi Poke. I also noticed they sell Kim Che for those that are fans. Can't wait to go back!

They do close at 6pm, so plan accordingly"}
{"text":"Ahi avocado bowl...holy hell, this thing is awesome.  Insane amounts of ahi, avocado, cucumber, and rice all for $10.  I have been eating here once a week for the last year, they don't even ask what I am ordering any more.  I am usually the only howlie in this place but I think they have finally accepted me.  

PS - Don't go here for lunch because that is when I go, I need to keep the lines short."}
{"text":"Considering we live in a desert with our poke options being limited...they serve theeee best poke. The fish taste just as \"fresh\" as it can get. I love their spicy ahi and you have to get the edamame seasoned. I Know-I-know...you don't go to Poke Express with edamame on
your mind-but do it. The owner once told me their fish is flown in from the islands. Which explains the quality of their tuna.

I head to Hawaii annually. After frequenting Poke Express, when I go home, eat poke, I actually get disappointed because I'm looking for that Poke Express essence. I eat seasoned edamame back home but those don't even compare to this place. 

The owners are so friendly and welcoming. It feels very personable. I don't know what more to say because if you know poke, you'll know poke especially after trying this spot out. Annnnd if you don't know poke...after trying some of the recommended ones you may come across after staring at the pictures or reading other reviews (spicy ahi, wasabi ahi are my faves), you're gonna know today! Errrr...whenever you go in. Lol. 

We enjoy our poke with rice, roasted seaweed, and an ice cold beer of choice that day. So nostalgic.

Lastly, I've gone in close to closing so they even offer closing specials to get rid of whatever is left. I can't guarantee you it happens everyday...but it has happened to me, so I'm sure it happens. 

They have kept their 5 star rating for a reason."}
{"text":"Howzitt!?! Eh you know fo' reals dis dakine local place ladet! While my pidgin may be a tad rusty, there is nothing at all rusty about the Poke Express. They have several kinds of poke & you can sample the wares before buying, how's about that eh? 

Mo' bettah, they got Poi! Fresh flown every Thursday (oops shouldn't have said that) from the islands with lots of aloha. As I am a poi boy from the get-go, I will stand there by the door before opening time on Thursday & be ready as a Waimanalo buggah who baddah you brah if you try zoom eh!? Well wadayaknow, my pidgin just got better already. Seriously, we are so blessed to live only a few miles from this place because in the Vegas Valley everything stay so fa' ladet!"}
{"text":"YUM! If you like sushi, then I recommend this place! Def not for those who are afraid to eat raw fish. If you're not sure of what things are, they will gladly describe and give you a little sample to help you decide."}
{"text":"Simply the very best poke in town hands down!!!! I can always count on this place to kill my cravings for Poke!!!! Great variety and just so damn good!!!"}
{"text":"I had the limu chili pepper ahi, shoyu ahi, Kim chee tako poke and smoked marlin.  They all reminded me of Hawaii instantly from when i walked in till I left, the ladies are so friendly and the food is ONO so go check it out."}
{"text":"Poke by the pound!!!  I can't even recommend anything bc everything behind the counter is fire! This place reminds of me Tamura's back in HI and that's part of why I love it so much! The owner is super friendly and they make everything in house, so they know their product and are happy to answer any questions you have. Also have a good selection of li hing muy stuff and Hawaiian Sun, pancake mix, etc for when you just get those cravings. 

Super clean and doesn't smell of fish! I call the owner uncle and everyone is attentive and knowledgeable. Make the trip up to N. Las Vegas for this place. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hell frickin' yeah! Great service, great poke. It's a little far, but so worth the drive. I've recommended Poke Express to numerous friends (both locations) and they have all thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend trying everything, because it's all good... :)"}
{"text":"It was delicious. Got 5 different poke here and they were all delicious. Ill def be going back when in vegas."}
{"text":"My new co-workers recommended this place for lunch one day and I'm so glad they did! This is my new favorite place for lunch in North LV. Poke Express is not a restaurant, it is more of a market with a few shelves of Hawaiian products, refrigerated kalua pork and drinks, and a variety of marinated poke and various seafood. You can order by the pound here or opt for their poke bowls which includes rice with furikake. My favorite so far has been the spicy ahi avocado and the spicy mayo masago with ahi. Another huge plus is that they allow you to try as many things as you want! I try to keep my taste-testing to the minimum, but sometimes I can't help it, everything is so delicious. The only down-side I can  think of is that there are no tables inside to enjoy the poke. Such a great find, I'll be back weekly for sure."}
{"text":"Visited Las Vegas for the weekend and a few friends from Hawaii recommended this place.  Plus it was near my friends house so that was a plus.  

Great selection of poke!  I wish we had a place like this in Arizona, but alas we don't.   

Since I had to drive back to Arizona, I stopped by and purchased a ice chest just to transport this poke and a few other Hawaii goodies.  As soon as I got home, I ate all of this onolicious poke!  

When I do visit Las Vegas again, this is my goto place!"}
{"text":"Love the customer service. I feel as tho I'm at home in he islands. The poke is on point. Must GO!!!"}
{"text":"Poke by the pound! I've been going here at least 2-3 times a month on my day off. The ahi tuna with wasabi and the ahi with shoyu sauce has always been spot on just can't get enough. The fish is always fresh here and i have never been disappointed. The staff have always been accommodating and are very friendly. It is a little pricey though at about 15 a lb. but still worth it for the quality and flavor."}
{"text":"This place is super awesome - in my dream world, this place would be in every town. 

The customer service is amazing and when the staff found out we were coming in for the first time, they insisted we try every single poke they had. I'm pretty sure my husband and I each sampled half a pound. I felt so bad about eating all that food for free because we were only ordering enough for our lunch but they kept insisting even after I said I was ready to order. They were incredibly generous. 

And that poke is delicious! Our faves were wasabi ahi poke and salmon poke. They have scoops of rice for sale and told us we cold go over to 808 hawaii mixed plate to sit down to eat since they don't have any seating inside. 

This place is totally worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Ended up here on Saturday around lunch time when the other Hawaiian joint in the same plaza was oddly closed for some reason (not enough cooks/catering gig). Whatever the reason was, I'm glad it led me to Poke Express. Thank you Yelp app... To me it was some of the tastiest poke I've had on the mainland. I'm for real! I feel like wherever they've had it in Southern California, I've sampled it. If a restaurant in Vegas offers it, I'm ordering it. But the poke I had here was as close to Hawai'i as I can get. And mind you, I was just on Oahu earlier this year, so my taste buds can sense the difference. Ha!

It was busy and there were lots of choices left even though it was getting near the end of their work day. You can tell this place is popular because of the amount of people waiting and some of their different types of poke being almost all out. I went with two individual 1/4 lb orders. One was ahi limu... You gotta have the limu. That is what's missing in most versions of poke & I feel it's so necessary,. And yes, I do know it's so hard to get and its scarcity is increasing. But for me, the limu makes the poke that much more delicious. I luh me some limu. The ahi limu poke was great. Loved the flavor. The tuna was fresh, the limu had a crispness to it and the shoyu along with the onions went along marvelously with it. So good...

The other poke i ordered was tako poke with limu. I love octopus and i love tako poke. I had some delicious sesame tako poke at Tanioka's in Waipahu (BEST I've ever had) and I've been searching for something close to that since I left Oahu. I would say that Poke Express is the closest I can find to what I remember having. And that's high praise... When I ordered my 1/4 lb, I asked the guy if the tako had sesame with it and he said they could add it if I like. Boom! Let me just say, the combination of the octopus, limu, shoyu and sesame oil/seed was so good. I can still taste it... I wish there was a place in LA that had something similar. I would probably go there once a week. So good... 

So I got those two 1/4 lbs containers of poke and also a can of Hawaiian Sun tropical iced tea. My favorite. I love hawaiian iced tea. I should've gotten 2 of them just like I should have gotten TWO 1/2 lb orders of poke instead 1/4 lbs ones. Fast, friendly service and delicious, quality ingredients. Winner winner poke breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"We had the ahi poke in chili sauce, lomi lomi salmon, kim chee tako, and sea salad. Rice is a rip off at 75 cents per scoop. We would have paid it, though, since we were hungry, but the place is not set up with any dine-in seating, so we took our order home. While everything tasted great with rice we made at home, all four of us (out of 5) who ate, all had tummy troubles (to put it nicely) not long after. In all my life I've never had problems eating poke. I have a feeling that my haole husband isn't gonna let me live this one down :( I don't think we'll be going back, at least not any time soon :("}
{"text":"I could just cry right now!! I work right across the street from Island Sushi and finally  made it there to try out their poke....WHY did it take me so long? IDK but I'm kicking myself after not having it for a YEAR! I specifically asked if I could go to lunch at 11:30 because I read that the lines get long. There was still a small wait but I ordered my garlic chicken bento from the island grill first...YUM! and then I ordered 1/4 lb wasabi on the side. It's not as spicy as the foodland poke on Maui but you can taste it and it was still amazing and fresh. I loved it. :)"}
{"text":"I would say this is average poke. I wouldn't say this is the best by any means. Nothing really stood out to me. Probably one of the best poke I've had in Vegas in a really long time, but call me crazy, but I thought it was a bit overpriced. 

I don't want to turn people off from here because the fish is really fresh and tasty. Butttt, I probably wouldn't choose to go back on my own."}
{"text":"Can someone ever top Poké express in Vegas ??? The answer is NO ! I always end up getting Poké express pretty much every week now. I always go to the Craig location but love going to the eastern one due to the fact we can dine in there. Also a Hawaiian restuarant is is next to it where we can order some Garlic chicken & mochiko chicken with rice ! 

Just to summarize my review I love Poké express and I wish I can be sponsored by them. (Ahahahha) all the workers are very friendly and not stingy with the food.

***100th review***"}
{"text":"THE FREAKIN BEST POKÉ IN TOWN!!!!!!!! this place cannot compare any where else to be honest. The poke here has some secret stuff in it that's like taking a bite off of Beyoncé's butt. Anyways for short this place is so delicious !!!!"}
{"text":"So glad Poke Express moved to this location. closer to me and easier to access than the 1 on Eastern in the sushi place. There tuna is always fresh and love they offer lots of flavors. I love the garlic poke. The only thing that I don't like here and is why I didn't give 5 stars is their hours. They apparently offer bowls but only for a few hours midday. And they close WAY too early so I can only come here on my days off. They should stay open til 8 so people can come by after work."}
{"text":"Another place that I have to swing by in Vegas. Food is always fresh and staff is always kind and courteous. You can sample all the flavors before buying. They offer military discount. There isn't any place to sit but there's a place down. But it doesn't take away from how good the poke is. Comes as small as 1/3lb to as much as you can handle. Not only do they have tuna, they have mussels, octopus, and clams."}
{"text":"Great place to go to get your protein cravings. After a hard core workout at the gym Poke Express is convenient, with great service and excellent selections of poke. I love the spicy tuna, spicy ahi and kimchi muscles along with a side of seaweed salad or brown rice."}
{"text":"There are not too many good places that serve poke in the Las Vegas area, but this spot in Henderson has probably the best poke I've had in the two areas!

SERVICE
I don't really order from Island Sushi (the restaurant poke express is in). I usually go straight to where they sell poke. Every time I have went the service has been great and the gentleman that I always see is always welcoming.

ATMOSPHERE
It is a very small restaurant with very few tables. It usually can get full so I recommend taking the poke to go.

FOOD
Salmon Poke: I love salmon and Poke Express is one of the few places that serve fresh, tasty salmon poke. It is also not drenched in the sauce already like some places but you can always ask for it to be. I like to pass on the sauce.

Spicy Ahi Poke: I usually order this with my salmon poke. The spicy mayo and the smelt egg sauce is great and the tuna is fresh as well.

I usually order half orders of each of these, so a pound every time I visit. The total usually comes out to be around $16. There are other sizes that you can choose from as well.

*As a side note I recommend going during the day. Towards the late afternoon to closing they can run out of some selections."}
{"text":"Love this poke spot. Located in the northern side of Las Vegas, the store can be a little hard to find but it's completely worth it. Be warned: everything here is raw, so please have an open mind and give this place a try. They have a large glass display of different flavored and types of raw fish. Everything taste fresh and you order the food by weight. Prices are fair but can get a little expensive if you order with your eyes and not your stomach. They even let you sample any poke you may be interested in. If you order rice, I recommend adding furikake. I believe it's a seasoning consisting of salt/sugar, sesame seeds, seaweed and it really enhances the meal. The kim chi crab is delicious but a little hard to eat because the shell is a bit pointy. This is one of the best poke spot in Las Vegas. Only drawback is this place is pick up only. There are no chairs or tables to enjoy your delicious food in the store. Will will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh poke. Awesome service and variety. I live across town and travel often just for this place."}
{"text":"So why have I waited soooooo long to come and check this place out?? Believe me as I was chowing on heavenly poke for lunch yesterday afternoon, that question kept going through my head.

First of all, terrific service from the staff working there. I was allowed and able to try every poke that I was considering purchasing up front. Second, each container was packed with lots of love from the islands and I could feel it. Extra sauce, plenty of napkins, utensils. They made sure we had everything we needed for the perfect picnic lunch. We enjoyed the traditional Shoyu poke, then moved into the spicy avocado poke with a hint of heat, and ended with the Wasabi laden poke!! Yes, my eyes were watering and my sinuses were cleaned out but I could not stop eating this delicious ahi!!! The poke was so fresh and seasoned just right. I felt like I was in Poke Heaven for real!!! We are huge fans of ahi tuna/poke and I have never had such delicious poke anywhere in this town!

The shop itself is simple, small and the poke is the main feature. They also carry some other island products which can be hard to come by. I also saw some t-shirts hanging in the corner so I will check those out another time. The only downside for me is their locations are extreme for me. We visited the one in NLV and there is another on Eastern. I wish there was one closer to home but it won't stop be from going back.

This place is definitely a 5 Star establishment on all levels! Mahalo Poke Express!"}
{"text":"Hands down has to be the best poke shop in town!! 


That fish is always fresh one of that pre frozen cheap stuff. 

The customer service from the owner is A+. 

He is always happy to help with any questions. 

My go to will always be 
Ahi limu, kimchi mussels, spicy Tako and wakame salad. 

It's right down the st for me so they will see me a lot haha.

Thank you for carrying great fish!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! I wish we had one of this places in the Bay Area. Nothing beats fresh raw fish with a nice cold one. This place reminds me a bit of Hawaii. The employees here are EXTREMELY nice, well I'm not sure I should call them employees as I believe that it's a family owned business if I'm not mistaken. One thing I like most about family own restaurants, shops etc. Is that they know how to treat their customers, they value you them very well, that goes for any family owned place, not just this one.

Back to the poke. We came this was my first time here, but I've tried their fish a few times when my brother brought some back from there. Even though this was my first time here, I've nearly tried everything poke here. From their crab salad, to their seaweed and of course their ahi. My favorite is their ahi they have ocean water ahi, spicy ahi and their regular ahi. They were all good. If you want to try a sample of any of e'm before buying the nice gentlemen will be glad to let you taste anything in their fridge. The prices here you can't beat if I'm not mistaken I got a pound of spicy ahi for no more than $11. That pound of fish will last a whole night with me and the fellas drinking. You surely can't beat that.

If you love poke, you better stop by here they have anything you want and more, check it out!

Keep up the good work guys I love Poke Express!"}
{"text":"Excellent poke! Fresh and delicious! I love this place! I would highly recommend it. I just wish it was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Best poke in town. It's not restaurant so pick up and go. The staff always so helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Best poke in town for true, original Hawaiian poke! They have the best selection and will let you sample anything. During lunch, they have their bowl specials where you can chose two types of poke and rice for a great deal. I usually only spend under $8 for it! They have a small grocery selection as well. This is more of a take out concept. There is no seating available if you're looking to stay and eat."}
{"text":"I am so addicted to this place! The poke is amazing and the service is too. You're always greeted with a smile and offered a sample. The poke varieties are vast and I'm working my way through them all. My favorite it the spicy tuna combo."}
{"text":"I believe in Yelp !  I just got the garlic poke with rice and it was amazing !!!  I will be back next time I'm in town..great job Poke Express !!"}
{"text":"New location of. 215/Stephanie is amazing. Best poke in town by a long shot, and the staff is always friendly. I plan on being a regular here for a long time. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing poke! Price is not bad either. Staff is very friendly and will let you try whatever you want. This place is awesome as an alternate to sushi, and adds a little bit of a different twist. I would recommend this place to anybody. Even if you don't like sushi, poke offers enough of a difference, and there are multiple types to choose from."}
{"text":"My family and I were on a weekend vacation from SoCal- my wife and I are originally from Oahu Hi - it's so hard to find Real Hawaiian style food where we live, made by real Hawaiian folks that were raised there so they know what the food is supposed to taste like- a local couple told us to come here and so we did and Wow!!! ...I'm soooo happy to have real Poke from folks that are FROM Hawaii!!! It makes such a difference! We also had local food from the restaurant part and it was super Ono!!! The good folks that work there are super nice and have real Aloha - We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"OMG! I can't believe I haven't rated Poke Express! Absolutely the best poke outside of Hawaii. Fabulous staff, lots of selections. This is our favorite  after movie treat. YUM!"}
{"text":"When I first came here I didn't know there was a counter in the back for poke orders. 

The place you're looking for is ISLAND SUSHI then walk to the back counter to check out their poke. 

I'm a big salmon fan so I get salmon every time. You can get 1-2 scoops of rice with your poke as well. 

Garlic ahi poke isn't too shabby. The ocean salad (seaweed) is nice. 

Get the 1/3 lb if you just want to try any of the other poke. I'm still trying to cycle through them and see which I like the best aside from poke. :)

Definitely a promising poke place to check out for all your poke cravings."}
{"text":"Hi, my name is Raul and I am addicted to Poke. I have a problem..and I cant stop eating it..Im like a zombie when I walk in and I must eat it all.

The food is simply awesome. So awesome that on the first bite, a mental soundtrack starts popping, and it changes every time I eat a different one.You got so many types of poke that it ll take you several trips to try each one . The owners are as sweet as they can be. Honest, hard working people , that serve you with a smile every time.

The spicy combo, tuna with avocado, Ahi Poke Limu are out of this world. I honestly eat it like its my last meal if I was on death row(might want to write this down)..Fresh, inexpensive and quick.

Only reason Im giving it 4 stars is because of the times of operation. 6pm closing time? really? ..Do you know how many tickets I've got for speeding from work to their spot. If it was until like maybe 8, it would def work better for me."}
{"text":"One of my personal favorites to go grab some Poke,  I just wish I could go grab at anytime. Great selection and excellent service. Everyone is always nice. If you like fish, stop by and give it a try."}
{"text":"The staff at Poke Express were amazing and so was the poke. My girlfriend has a gluten allergy and the staff were incredibly accommodating. We will be back many times."}
{"text":"Who would have known I'd be able to get my poke fix in Las Vegas? Fresh poke made to order and every single bite did not disappoint. 

We ordered limu poke and spicy ahi poke... mouth watering! Every piece had the perfect amount of seasoning and blends. 

Not only do they sell poke but they also desserts. I wanted to try their malasadas but unfortunately they had ran out already. In addition, they also sell Hawaiian Drink mix! For those who drink more than the can this is the best way to go! 

Next time I'm in town, you know I'm for sure to hit up Poke Express!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! A great variety of different poke. I love the oyster sauce poke, kimchee mussel poke, and Hawaiian style poke. If you come in later in the day, the staff will make the poke for you right then and there so that they don't have leftover poke at the end of the day. The fish is fresh and the sauces are yummy! You may even try a sample of something before you buy it. I would eat Poke Express every day if I could afford it!"}
{"text":"Really good stuff. Everything is fresh. The dudes behind the counter are super chill, they answer any questions and sometimes they give tastes of their awesome fish. Freshest clams I've ever had!!

Good location. Fast service. Stayed yummy till the next day!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Hawaiian style poke. I had lots of recommendations from friends to try this place out. They have different varieties of poke, from spicy ahi, to kimchee crab & mussels. Everything about this place has the Hawaii vibe. The poke was fresh & definitely reminded me of home! I highly highly recommend this place if you want authentic Hawaiian style poke! I recommend the spicy ahi & ahi limu!!"}
{"text":"My craving for awesome poke has been fulfilled and I have THIS place to thank for it.

I've been on the search for some good quality poke. There use to be a poke market located on Warm Springs and Arroyo Grande, but closed down 1.5 years ago so since then.. I've been searching and searching and FINALLY have tried this place.

They have a good range of different pokes which you can find on their website. I got 1/4 pound of their shoyu poke, 1/2 furikake poke, and 1/2 spicy tuna equaling out to be $24 (roughly). I can say that I am a fan of their furikake and spicy tuna. There's just so much flavor that my mouth is watering at the mere thought. The shoyu poke was good, don't get me wrong, but next to the furikake and spicy tuna (both pack a good punch of flavors) - this wasn't my favorite out of the 3. 

I will definitely be back to order more in the future. It's a piece of Hawaii in a small plastic container.

Tip: Call ahead of time to place your order. I'm not sure if their supply runs out, but better save than sorry."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for steering us to Poke Express.  They have awesome Ahi Poke with a wide variety of sauces and other dishes.  Very fresh and great service.  Prices were reasonable given the selection and quality.  Will definitely be back.  Nice island style."}
{"text":"Best poke I have ever had it is even better than places I've been to in Hawaii. Unbelievably fresh and great selection!"}
{"text":"I used to come here to get poke. Their sauces are too spicy with too much soy sauce for my taste and made my stomach upset. So I just started getting the raw fish and making delicious sandwiches at home using my own spicy mayo. Really great on an English muffin with cream cheese. 
After a while they remembered me and my order which was nice. I haven't had time to go again, but their fish is great. My husband didn't like the octopus though. Too much onion in their mix."}
{"text":"Best poke in Las Vegas! It's fresh, delicious, fairly priced, and they have an excellent selection! I have been going to Poke Express for multiple years, and I will definitely continue to. It's about a 30 minute drive from where I live, but it's worth every mile!"}

Who would've thought that this small shop, located in a strip mall in North Las Vegas had some of the best poke around?!

'And served with plenty Aloha!

The closest thing to poke from the aina that I've found to date on the mainland... 'And of course, I had to drive 4 1/2 hrs from Orange County to find it! (Just think a 1/2 hour more on a plane, I could've been sampling in Hawai'i!) I've tried plenty mainland poke, this was a taste of \"home.\" (People have grumbled about the prices but if you've been to the islands lately, you'd know the prices are comparable to Foodland - $14.99/$16.99 per pound.)

'Was on a weekend trip to Vegas and to change things up, my cousin, SE, & I ventured out from the main hub of the downtown/strip area to check out the surrounding, local cities. (Plus I wanted to cruise by the local COSTCO & fill up the tank... 'Not to mention, pick up a case of water versus a single bottle from the hotel lobby for the same price, $5.) Eh brah, I local, not \"loco!!\"

On our way back we yelp*d \"lunch\" & up came Poke Express - A solid 5 Stars w/eighty-plus reviews, those are good odds. It was about 11:30am & the case was jam packed with great looking choices. If you get to the shop early enough, you can sample as many of the different poke dishes. 
\"Like sample?!\" SHOOT'Z!

'Looks like we arrived before their afternoon rush, because the unadulterated trays of poke were... 'Beautiful. (Eyes tearing up)

By the time 3pm rolls around, most of their trays are empty.

We left w/a 1/2 pound of:
Salmon Poke w/Special Sauce - \"Winnahs!...\"
Kim Chee Tako Poke - \"Winnahs!...\"
Spicy Avocado Poke - \"Winnahs!...\"
Combo Poke - \"Winnahs!...\"
Ahi Wasabi - \"And mo' winnahs!\"
(My two favorites were the Salmon & Spicy Avocado.)

After we left here, we stopped by \"808 Hawaii Mixed Plate,\" located in the same plaza. Da poke was ono w/rice!

{"text":"They ran my sister's card but doubled the tip she was trying to give them. That's not even legal. The food was good but sadly, we won't be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"This business is the real deal when it comes to representing the finest hawaiian style poke assortment. Quality is exceptional, service is as friendly and accommodating as can be, and pricing is very reasonable. For all the locals and locals at heart, this place will not disappoint. Also pick up your favorite local snacks and grinds while you wait for your poke to be made fresh. Try it once and for certain you'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the Furikake ahi poke!! so BIG TIP for anyone who doesnt know about this place... its located in the Island Grill!!  nexxt to the sushi place... 

So good and reasonable price.. I absolutely fell in love with the poke!  
Check it out  if you want the simple shoyu or the amazing Furikake! Do it!  they come in sizes 1/4 pound 1/2 pound a pound or 2 pounds! just try some of each to know which one you like definately some good poke!! 

yum yum in my tum tum!!! 


Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everytime I'm in Vegas I have to come here n grab some to go. It also walking distance is 808. Both places have awesome food & service! And Monday you can get a poke bowl!!!"}
{"text":"Hawaii in Las Vegas, Aloha!!

One of my yelp friend (Sandra S) raved about this place on her last visit to sin city. I love Hawaiian food so I bookmarked it knowing I was going in December. Fast forward a few months and I'm in Hawaiian Heaven. 

Here's the run down:
Fried Mac N Cheese Balls - a good starter. It was fried perfectly and the mac n cheese was so creamy inside. It was cheap too. $2.45 for 4 big pieces. Delicious 

We came here for the Poke, we got:
Shoyu Ahi poke - my favorite, Delicious. 
Ahi Furukake poke - it was still a bit frozen, but still good. 
Spicy Ahi Combo w/ Crabs, Avocados & Cucumber - my favorite 1A. Delicious
Tako poke w/ Limu (seaweed) - octopus was super tender. 
 The Ahi's were big chunks of raw tuna. So fresh, so good. You've got to try this place if you like poke. 

We also got some hot dishes.
Loco Moco - we were all loco for this dish. The best loco moco I've ever had. The hamburger was just so flavorful and you get two big hand made patties. The gravy is just money. With two eggs & two scoops of rice. Oh man, this alone made the trip here so worth it. Delicious. Must order here. 

Kalua Pig & Cabbage - another winner. Authentic Hawaiian dish. No fake smoke, tender, juicy goodness. Yum yum yum. 

Kalbi - Delicious, fall off the bone tender and  the marinade was spot on. Cooked to perfection. Delicious. 

Hilo Bay Bento Special - this had everything. A piece of spam, pork cutlet, pork teriyaki, beef short rib, noodles, pickled radish and all on a bed of rice. This dish is a mouthful and everything was so so good. It's a special, so they might not have it everyday, but if they do, get it. You won't regret it. 

The service was very friendly and helpful. We ordered a lot of  food and kept adding to the order and the guy taking the order was very patient with us. 

The place is small. A few tables (for 2 only) line the wall. Get your food to go. 

I need a nap now after that luau we just had. 
Hawaiian food done right. 

Sandra, thank you for the recommendation!!

I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I love poke. This place has a nice variety. You get it and go. I came back a second time just to prove to myself that it really is that good."}
{"text":"Best poke ever!!!! I will be coming back. So many choices! Very good customer service."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite after work stop! Great take-out. They have a wide selection of seafood that has amazing seasoning. The fish is sold by weight and I just make some rice at home to complete the meal. It's a routine stop for me."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING AND I MEAN EVERYTHING IN HERE.... is fan-f*ing-tastic

don't say i didn't warn ya.  i bit of a drive off the strip but it sure as hell was worth it!"}
{"text":"Don't get frustrated looking for this hole in the wall.  This is a poke counter within a restaurant, so look for signs for Island Sushi & Grill.  

This joint is tiny and tight, but so worth it.  Arguably, this place can easily survive in Hawaii.  Yes, it's previously frozen fish and prices are a bit high at about $16/ lb, but you will agree this is a good fix for good poke.  

Heavily seasoned, I still enjoy the avocado ahi and tako kimichi.  With a quick appetizer, that leaves plenty of room for me to enjoy their awesome kalua pig w/ cabbage or even a mini chicken katsu curry.  This place reminds me of Hawaii and it's so nice to see some folks originally from the Motherland dining here to validate the aloha here.  

My only beef is their malasada was a sorry excuse.  We got it fresh and it just permeated of alcohol and the first bite was, gag!  I was upset, because I found a hair on my malasada and they replaced it with a non-fresh one.  I got over it, learned my lesson and will never order it again.  Other than that, this place is a solid 4 stars for me.

Pay $2 for the frequent customer loyalty card.  After you spend $250, they credit $25 for food here. (This card is not good for the poke counter, just for the kitchen food and sushi from the restaurant)"}
{"text":"Get your poke fix on.  The way they serve it up in Hawaii, is how they do it here.  Ala carte, everything sold by weight.  Pick and choose what you see and ask for extra spicy if you're into that stuff.  The cashier told me they can add habanero if you like it spicier.  Not my style, but they cater to their customers here.  

The fish is the best here, whatever you consider fresh for poke.  I'll have to imagine it's previously frozen, but this stuff is good down to the last bite.  The guy who mixes it in the back has got the right combination of shoyu making it not too salty and not too spicy and sweet, but just perfect. 

They try to get folks in and out, assuming everyone is a repeat customer.  They should slow down the pace to ensure everyone gets good service especially for first timers who are curious about poke."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. As close to Hawaii as you can  possibly get in the middle of the desert. Stopped in and grabbed some wasabi ahi and avocado ahi poke. Bother were perfect. Nice chunks of tuna and fantastic flavoring. 

Extremely friendly counter service and helpful in the selection.

Should not be missed. May head back for dinner now."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the best poke place in town tbh. It's on a whole other level that makes you want to refer to all the other \"\"poke\"\" bowl places with double quotations.

They serve up the BEST Hawaiian-style poke, super market style by the pound. And everything is good here. If you don't believe me, the service is always friendly and nice enough to let you sample. My favorites are the furikake poke, the avocado poke, and imitation crab combo as a side. The furikake poke is more sweet, the avocado poke is fresh, and the imitation crab combo is creamy and addictive.

They also serve up white and brown rice for a complete meal. There's no seating though, so you can't eat it here. You'll just have to indulge in your gluttonous poke needs at home, or in your car if you can't wait.

Overall, definitely, definitely recommend. I drive across town just to satisfy my poke fix, and it is always worth it."}
{"text":"The poke is always fresh and the service is always friendly and hospitable. They let you sample as many items as you like. Sizes rance from a 1/4 lb plastic container to 1lb plastic containers. Right now open 9AM-9PM."}
{"text":"I don't live here, but I work here; and every time I come to this area, I make sure I stop by. It takes me back to Hawaii, and it's not like your typical \"trendy\" poke place (how did this happen anyway?). I crave this place knowing it's authentic Hawaiian poke. 

If you want authentic, unglorified poke, this is the place. But just know there's no seating and no bathrooms--but it's worth eating in your car :9"}
{"text":"I see what all the fuss is about.. The store front does come to you fast if your looking for it for the first time on craig so make shure you look for it or will be doing a u turn like I did. I ordered Ocean Salad and the kim chee style dish. I have been to many Korean restaurants in the past and have tried ocean salad and bye far this rocks basically ate the whole thing in one sitting ! I wanted to try the kim chee dish cause I love kim chee and its really good not to spicy like you might see but descent heat to it. The products are really fresh and great. flavors etc. The owners are very friendly and accommodating to new customers witch is nice. I did see a blue fin sashimi looked really good. I wish they did have a little flyer hand out though for call in's or catering would be nice to have since I am a new local its always great to find restaurants that are really amazing thanks yelpers. !"}
{"text":"I have been to many poke places both in Hawaii and on the mainland, and this is BY FAR the most authentic place on the mainland and as close as you'll ever get to the market-style places that you see on the islands.

It's setup just like a deli only the meat is raw marinated fish.  And really really fresh at that.

From I believe 10am to 2pm you can get a poke \"bowl\" with some fish and rice served on a plate, but otherwise you buy the fish by the pound.

Oh man is it delicious.  I have already converted one of my friends who never eats raw fish.

The owners and/or workers were so nice and happy to be providing this authentic dish to Vegas patrons.  They were great.  Give it a shot, you will feel like you have been whisked away to Hawaii."}
{"text":"I love poke, with that being said, one would not think to come to Las Vegas for good poke, but a las, where else can you find poke served deli style!  Everyone there is very friendly and welcoming, and patient when we were trying to decide which types to try.

We ended up getting the limu poke and the spicy poke, both super good, although we couldn't handle the heavy mayo in the spicy poke after awhile.   But we figured that and only got a little.

Man, I swear, if I lived out in Vegas, I'd be poking it up at least once a week hehe."}
{"text":"Anytime I bring my son to Craig Ranch Park we make it a point to stop in at Poke Express. I love pretty much everything they have. If you don't know or forgot what something tastes like they wont hesitate to give you a sample. Sometimes you can get other things like sashimi and REAL wasabi. I would suggest everyone try the real wasabi at least once if your only experience with it is the neon green playdoh stuff in every sushi restaurant. I even like the stuffed Inari that they have available on occasion. Oh and if they look like they are out of your favorite poke ask them to make some more, it doesn't take long"}
{"text":"The food is good here, but the changes they've made to their ordering system is ridiculous. 

I watched my order sit on the counter for almost 10 minutes while the girl running the register moved slower than slow. She then decided to weigh the other orders waiting on the counter before doing anything else. The line of customers waiting for a to-go order was 10 deep... With most of the orders complete and waiting for her. 

I was a two or three times a week customer. I'm done."}
{"text":"My kids love this place, they just could not have enough of it. Me? Well, I'm more picky I guess. I don't go as often as they do but I have always enjoyed it when I do."}
{"text":"Being from the islands, it's really hard to find legitimate spots to enjoy your island favorites. Its's even more harder, when you live in the middle of a desert and want fresh seafood like poke, raw crab, smoke tako, lomi lomi salmon and other island style apps. This spot has most of the grindz you'd find back home and then some. They have slabs of ahi and salmon, maki sushi, cone sushi and they can supply you with the island necessities like lau laus, saimin (ramen for you mainland folks), Hawaiian Sun drinks, Shoyu (soy sauce for non-island people), longonesa (not the sweet one), and diamond head bakery soda crackers just to name a few. Everyone who works there always displays that aloha spirit. So if you're ever in need of a true poke fix, head on over to poke express!"}
{"text":"I'm not Hawaiian, but I do like Hawaii. I can't really tell you if this is authentic or not, but it's delicious!

If you like salmon, be sure to get there early because it sells out pretty quickly. My favorite is the salmon with spicy mayo (they don't put it out, you have to ask for it). 

The employees are always friendly and easy going, true Hawaiian style. I haven't seen the older man who works there in a while, but he's like a kind uncle that makes you try everything until you're so full you're not even sure you want to order food anymore. 

If you order food from island sushi (also good), they'll bring your poke order over to the cash register so you can pay together."}
{"text":"My Husband and I recently came to Las Vegas for a family function and was recommended to go here because I've been craving Poke, Hawaii style. We walked in, seen the different varieties of poke and the seen all the li hing mui goodies and nori/mochi popcorn and went crazy. Within our two days there we went each day and stocked up on all the goodies. I really wish there was a poke express out here in the East Bay (Cali). I swear I would probably clear your shelves daily. Lol and eat all of the shoyu poke. Thank you for making our Vegas trip that much more exciting. Keep up the good work. And look into making a Bay Area location"}
{"text":"Super good and super fresh poke.  I like getting a 1/2 lb of the spicy combo poke (mayo, avocado, and other delicious goodness), a 1/2 lb of the poke w/shoyu (regular poke w/soy sauce dressing), and a 1/2 lb of their seaweed salad and I'm all set!

The poke here is absolutely delicious and I will keep going back for each poke craving I get.  The staff are really friendly, they let you sample the stuff before you buy it, and the poke just really speaks for itself and delivers."}
{"text":"PHONE YOUR ORDER AHEAD OF TIME!!!! The tuna poke goes FAST. I was already warned to do this, but I didn't because my schedule was very loosely planned. *shrugs*.

I was still able to sample some stuff and enjoyed my order thoroughly. \

LOVE that they do tako wasabi here. The kimchi octopus is tasty as hell too. I usually get this at sushi boat places but they sell it here by the lb! In the end I wound up with tako wasabi and spicy salmon poke. SO GOOD. Wish I had some chips to eat it with..

They also sell Hurricane popcorn by the bag. Service is prompt and they've very friendly. 

P.S. This place is way out in the boonies.. like, the hood. If you don't have a car, don't cab it."}
{"text":"Braddah.  This.  Is.  My.  Place....away from home.

When I found this place, I thought my excitement level was high, but then I experienced the awesome service and actually tasted everything...and discovered it to be AMAZEBALLS.  There was a legit party going on in the castles of my taste buds.  I couldn't believe North LV had such an awesome place and had to tell everyone!  No lie, the very next day, I came back with my co-residents, and they loved it too--obvi.  Then day three...yes, I frequented Poke Express.  Again.  Three days in a row--that's gotta be a record for me!  I am in love!  Of course, I've come back since then, but not every day due to the fact that I can't keep stuffing myself with all this deliciousness otherwise I'd explode.

Real talk though.  Poke Express hits the spot, especially in North Las Vegas area, where to even get good Asian-ish restaurants, I need to travel 20+ minutes away down to Spring Mountain Road area.  I've tried pretty much everything they have by now.

I recommend the sweet chili tuna and the salmon poke.  If you like raw crabs, you gotta try their kim chi raw crab--it's so goooooood.  Make sure to get their scoop of rice (75 cents) with furikake.  They sometimes run out, so make sure to ask early!  I've been lucky in that they've always had it when I've asked.  

Anyway, I'll definitely come back here again and again and again.

Tip 1: They do a $2 off military discount for any of their tuna/ahi poke.  
Tip 2: If you get the rice, you HAVE to order it with the furikake (seaweed seasoning).
Tip 3: Sample EVERYTHING.  They're super nice and will let you sample as many things as you want!  Take advantage of it!"}
{"text":"The poke was very good.  This place a great yelp find.  It was a little confusing on the first visit on how it works.  If its before 2pm you can get a combo plate (called something else).  After 2 must be ordered by the pound.  Prices were reasonable.  
My only complaint was that the seaweed salad (called ocean salad) tasted bad.  That's why they get 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"I had once came across this place when hearing about poke being available in Vegas, but never did I think that I would find a place that could match some of the food that I had picked up when in the islands. 

I've been born and raised on a Hawaiian/Japanese mix of food growing up with my background being such, so to stumble upon a place that could match that island feel in the middle of a desert was great!

Their poke selection was pretty good and fairly reasonable. I went early in the morning, so I probably beat the lunch rush, which seemed to be coming in as I left. Not realizing that this place was located in Island Grill, I was happy to be able to order a full meal with my spicy avocado poke. 

Just like the hole-in-the-wall musubi place in O'ahu, I was able to get my small bento box with mochiko chicken! While there was nothing fancy about it, it definitely had the authentic feel of a meal I could pick up in the islands. 

The poke itself was also delicious! The ahi looked and tasted fresh and mixed with the avocado, it ended up being a great treat to eat with my bento box. 

It's a small place, but you'll get a good range of things you can find in the islands during your getaway in the desert of Las Vegas.
