{"text":"This place is new to the neighbourhood. Our family voted this place as best fries in the area. We will return."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips. Stopped in for taco tuesday, amazing! Best fish tacos in Toronto by far."}
{"text":"My husband and myself had dinner here recently, we were excited to try this fairly new restaurant, as it is hard to get a good decent restaurant in the Beach Area. My husband ordered the fish and chips and I had the grilled halibut and chips. When my food came out I was a bit shocked at how small the piece of halibut was, you really needed a search warrant for it. The plate was all french fries with a very small, skinny piece of halibut. I do understand that Halibut is very expensive, however at $16.00 I expected more. Also, my fish became really cold very quickly because it was put on cold plate. My husband thought his fish and chips were so/so. Their coleslaw was not very good either, no flavour at all, and their tartar sauce was not tartar sauce, I didn't like it. Its unfortunate as we were really looking forward to having a good fish and chip place in the Upper Beach."}
{"text":"The piece of halibut was so tiny! And the fries were so salty I could only eat a few - and as I got take out there was no way to bring them back. No one makes fries with that much salt! Seriously some is fine but when fries burn your mouth from the salt - not pleasant. $18 rip off. yuck."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service and welcoming vibe.  I have brought my fish and chip loving (British) family here and they were wowed.  
I am vegetarian and LOVE the battered tofu options - taco, sandwich or plain.  The fries and onion rings are a must.  Brussels sprouts are yummy addition too."}
{"text":"Consistently good.  Fish is always fresh and the batter is light and tasty.  We have been for lunch and dinner several times and are always pleased."}
{"text":"What a great find in the East end! My dining companion and I each had the haddock + chips and we really enjoyed our dinner. The fish was nicely cooked within a nice crispy batter, and the chips had a nice crunch. The cost was very reasonable as the fish (and chips) portions were huge. We are looking forward to enjoying more dinners at Foodoe's."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, even better food. I will definitely be back with friends and family. Highly recommend to all crowds."}
{"text":"this should be a 3.5; would have been a 4 except that the crab fries were only meh-ish, and not as wonderful as I was expecting. pretty normal and average tasting fish and chips; price point was average as well (maybe even a tad bit expensive). however, great little joint, and hope the best for their business! :D"}
{"text":"Great service and a friendly community environment combined with amazing fish and a wonderful original tartar sauce, makes this place a go to."}
{"text":"I'd heard about this place from a neighbour and decided to try it for lunch.  I am very impressed.
I had a very simple haddock and chips.  Sometimes the most simple dishes are the easiest to screw up it seems.
Now I was lucky as the place had opened for the day a half hour before my arrival so I got to be served by the owner who was working solo. A very amiable host.
The dish arrived quickly and freshly cooked.  
The fish was perfect, no more and no less.  The batter was just as you would find it in the UK.  It didn't smother the fish and wasn't to big and greasy.  It was crisp!  The fish inside wasn't over cooked.  A very common thing.
The chips were great.  Not the shoestrings or the wedges that some places use.  But freshly cut and fried to perfection just the same as you would find in the best chippy in Scotland.
Now they also have locally brewed beer on tap at the wonderful live edge bar that the owner and his grandfather milled and finished from a tree.
I will be going back regularly!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Had the Scottish beer, and the fish and chips. (Both Cod and Haddock). Also, ordered the Chowder. Sent the chowder back/did not eat. Could be me, could be the chowder, no matter. Really enjoyed the fish and chips. The Cod version had a hint of garlic that really made it special. The onion rings were a notch above anything I've had before. In the Beach, tough to find a reliably good meal. I liked this one. Scottish Beer was a lovely accompaniment. Hope the place sticks around. Funky, without pretension."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing!! The atmosphere is quiet, we were the only ones there for the first 30 min. The only downfall was that there was one guy working the entire restaurant, so it took longer for the food because he was serving and cooking. Our portions were generous and his recommendations on point. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!

The fish was very tasty and the batter was perfect!

Met the owner - very enthusiastic!

Definitely recommend as there are not too many good fish and chips places in the this end of the city!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great staff. This place is part of my usual lunch routine and never let's me down."}
{"text":"The crab fries are awesome. Never even thought that could be a thing, but it is, it exists, and it's good. Love that it's actual crab meat. 

Fish tacos were good sized and satisfying. Not a huge menu but the service is friendly. Good times."}
{"text":"Really attentive service, great food, and cool decor"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and both times the food has been good. Good batter and fries and that's what it's about isn't it?

Didn't care for the mayo (tartar sauce, not sure) or coleslaw as they seemed to have a ton of raw garlic. 

Also a bit pricey for fish and chips."}
{"text":"Great place for fish and chips in the neighborhood. They offer different types of fish which is cool and last time they even had oysters. Super friendly service. I wasn't a fan of the onion rings but that's just me."}
{"text":"This review is for their fish taco from the Toronto Taco Fest in June 2018. I love a fish taco and saw their stand and said, if anyone should be able to make a perfect fish taco, it would be a fish n chips shop. So I tried it. Loved it. Prob best fish taco I've ever had. Tied for best taco at the festival imo. Perfectly fried fish filet, not too much hoopla in the taco. Just a great simple fish taco. I'll def make plans to hit up their brick n mortar next time I'm in TO!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great atmosphere, great staff and amazing food!!

They also do a comedy night on Saturdays that's actually pretty funny and free"}
