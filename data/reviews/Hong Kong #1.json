{"text":"I grab lunch from here all the time for my work. It is a great place for cheap delicious food! the lunch plates are around $4-5! The employees are nice and welcome you as you enter, always have a smile and the place is clean as well!"}
{"text":"The only this I get from here is my fried scallops since no one else in this town makes them. An there are a few other items on their menu that I have liked."}
{"text":"Restaurant under new management and not for the better.  The.previous ownership delivered food that was hot and tasty. Now, the food is still hot and tasty but the taste is bad. The hot and sour soup was awful. King P.o. chicken was hot and sour but not sour in a good sour. Just sour.

Went from 4 stars down to 1 1/2."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Chinese food, good price though and cleAn restaurant. Will be back here again."}
{"text":"I actually liked this place. It was clean, good service and hot, delicious food. Those egg rolls were incredible! The employees are very friendly and attentive. They should have different cup sizes as they only have 1 (its about Medium in size).

The food was very well cooked, i had no problems in my food at all. The location outside its very specious, lots of parking. They have a fountain drink dispenser with free refills if you want to. 

In all this is a nice place to go order, I did not check the restrooms or anything so I can't talk about that in this review. Other than that I would definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"They've been open for over 10 years! Fried chicken wings are really good. I also like their lunch specials."}
