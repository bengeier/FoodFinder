{"text":"A couple of us crazies were in need of our daily Medicine and Taste of Heaven was the choice of the day.  It is Chinese Herbal Medicine prepared as part of the meal.  That might sound weird to most of you but Chinese Medicine is all natural/herbal as in the most basic form of the ingredients and some can be consumed on a regular basis.

Herbal Medicine is usually boiled/extracted for hours to be consumed in a Soup rather than in Pill format  you're so used to.   I would still HIGHLY suggest that if you're not sure if you can consume such items, then this might not be for you.  Either that or CONSULT your Family Doctor.   2.5 *Star*

The reason the store is so tiny and barely reasonable for dining-in might be due to the fact they distribute their Herbal items(Chicken, Beef, Pig Ear, etc...) to Chinese Grocer T&T Supermarket, therefore there's a limited few that will come to this barely visible plaza for a meal.

Herbal Chicken on Steam Rice($4.99) is probably the go-to item as Herbal Chicken is the popular item they distribute.  1/2 Small Chicken which seemed to be the Free-range variety.  The Herbal flavour wasn't intense so I was happy to consume it but be prepared to wait for this item as much as 20 minutes.

Herbal Beef Noodle($4.99) had lovely Shank meat I believe as some pieces had some tender gelatinous to it.  The Noodle was perfectly cooked to chewiness.  As noted from previous review, the Soup Base was Salty/Oily but that didn't bother the 3 youths next to us from picking up the entire bowl and drinking it all.

Salty to the point that I thirst for Juice although I noticed they had drinks for $1.00 each or as you eat facing the Convenience Store, I just went elsewhere for Fresh Juice.  You might have to ask in Mandarin for Water as the only Gentleman(Cook, Waiter, Cashier, Washer) didn't bring any to us."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Chinese Herbal cuisine, this place is for you!!!...  though they only have a few items on the menu. The meats are very tender. The beef noodle is my favorite!!! I can tell they didn't use lots of MSG. One of my friends said the noodles are a little bit salty, but it's just perfect for me."}

I don't think I am ready to be a Chinese Royalty or Chinese Empress as yet. As I read this article that was framed on the wall in this small 2 table restaurant about these Royal cuisine. (http://www.thestar.com/living/article/551141) 

The prices here are so reasonable! 

The Herbal Beef Noodle ($4.99) has really tender and melt in your mouth beef brisket and the noodle though is store bought has a nice chewy bite to it. There is this really strong herbal/medicine taste in the beef.. probably those are slow cook in the strong herbal broth. However, the soup based is so oily and salty! There is this oil layer formed on top of the soup after we finished eating that.. (How can something that is good for you be so salty and oily??) 

The Royal Herbal Chicken with rice ($4.99) is huge too. It has half of the chicken. The chicken is the smaller version, think spring chicken. The chicken does taste ok. Though the white meat is a little tough since it was supposed to be deep fried in vegetable oil first then simmered in the 28 different ingredients for 1 hour. There is plentiful of rice at least 2 bowls and the sauce that the chicken was cooked in give the rice a little bit of the herbal taste. 

BTW, in order for these Royal Medical cuisine to regulate your body and cure it in anyway, you will have to be eating these at least once a week for months..... hmmm I don't know if I can handle that!! 

Our server, cashier and the cook is really nice and friendly. An excellent place to practice your Mandarin!! 

They accepts Cash only!"}
