{"text":"So I've been waiting to review this restaurant for a while largely due to the inconsistencies of previous owners.  I can honestly say now that this place is a keeper and one of my \"go to\"  Japanese restaurants.  And I can be really brutal when it comes to reviewing lesser establishments (see my other reviews). Also I have spent time in Asia and Japan and once worked in a high end Japanese restaurant myself many years ago.  That having been said I know that most Asian food has been americanized and tailored to the American palate .  The thing that these guys do is maintain consistent quality, Great and friendly service with a pretty diverse menu.  Some great deals can be had with the pick two or three options and there are some unique items like crispy rice/spicy tuna (yum! ) and crunch target or hot lover rolls.  I wouldn't necessarily call it high end but they manage to be consistent throughout their menu which is impressive.  Today I had a bento box with crispy chicken and spicy salmon roll.  I was really hungry and could barely finish it. All in all its a very good Japanese place with some other Asian influences.  BON APPETIT!"}
{"text":"27 Aug 2012

This restaurant is centrally, located next to a Starbuck's, but with a noisy (no sound buffering) atmosph. including \"sports-only\" TV.  

Food looks better on their pictorial menu then what actually arrives.  Portions seem skimped, or heavier on the \"starch\" fillers.  Offer both raw and fully cooked items; good soups, pot stickers, etc. but pricey for the size of their portions."}
{"text":"I order over the phone tuna tataki 3hand roll and asked if 2california 1spicy tuna and tempura vegetable it took over 40 min wen my husband picked it up I couldn't believe the hand rolls were the size of a felt pen and the paper sea weed crumble in my hand .He had charge us 47.00 so I call and told him he said he would correct and give us back like 15.00 that he charge to much so another half hour later we get back the 3 rolls the only one that was right was tuna the other two I don't know no California hand roll the last 3time I Was there it was again over price and did not get for my money ,I'm done going there.not worth it."}
{"text":"We travel to Fountain Hills frequently throughout the year and happened to stumble across Katana while on the quest to explore and support more of the local businesses in town. Were we ever happy to discover this tucked away gem!  Their extensive and creative sushi menu will please even the pickiest of fish eaters while also providing adequate options for non-sushi-lovers. I sampled some of their beef udon on our last visit and I have been craving it ever since. The staff is always friendly and even remembered us on only our second visit. Katana is definitely now on our 'must-visit' list every time we're in town."}
{"text":"Menu items are expensive - service was ok- food didn't taste or look fresh-over $60 for three people. Save your money and go else where. Wanted a tempura shrimp roll to remove the eel and crab cost 2 extra. Will notnreturn"}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:15. There were three only three tables occupied.  We ordered a appetizer and 4 rolls. Two tables were filled as I waited on my appetizer. When they started to have food delivered to table I asked about our appetizer.  Within a few minutes appetizer arrived followed by 3 of 4 rolls. I refused appetizer and we started on our rolls thinking the 4th was coming. 
At this point it's 7:00 and the restaurant was full.  They had 2 servers and 2 chefs.  The server was asking to take our empty plates not knowing 1 roll never came.  I asked about the total confusion and she apologized and said come on a Tuesday or Wednesday, service would be better.
One of my fav. Sushi.  One of the worst service."}
{"text":"Love the bento box for lunch. Favorite is chicken teriyaki. My partner had the salmon and also raved about it. Great prices, great service, great food."}
{"text":"First time was not great, Tried again and definitely nothings changed. Hard rice/ small rolls/crap happy hour. The best is Shaggy preparing the sushi. WTF, Really a young white dude?  The two stars is for the waitress who was by herself and obviously trying. Meh, I'm gonna skip and head to Stingray or Toyama."}
{"text":"best sushi I ever had. love this place!!!! the Oktoberfest is to die for. new owners kept it on the menu and I couldn't be happier!!! prices are good and who would have thought sushi in fountain hills. well I'm one happy customer"}
{"text":"We ordered a wide variety of rolls, and  sashimi. All excellent   My new favorite place for sushi."}
{"text":"Friendly service and a great intimate atmosphere serving extraordinary sushi which is a rare find in the desert, especially in a small town! The ramen bowls, jalapeño rolls, garlic tuna rolls, and peanut dressing are the mainstays we keep coming back for again and again!"}
{"text":"$6 for a 12oz bottle of Perrier, no lunch specials, and a $22 tab for a Cali roll, Philly roll and the water...the staff was friendly, but it was definitely overpriced. If you're going to charge someone that much for water, let them know first."}
{"text":"BK the owner and Sushi chef is fabulous. Great place. Definitely worth stopping in to try."}
{"text":"Updating my review from 5 years ago...gave this place another try after many years, because my companion wanted to go. Portions were perfect, prices are much much more reasonable! Waiter was quick and pleasant. I will be back more often now!!!"}
{"text":"First let me say that the sushi was fantastic.  Fresh, flavorful, and fairly priced. If this review was soley based on the food I would give this place 5 stars.  However, when I go out to eat, I also expect an \"experience\" which involves not only the food, but the atmosphere and the service as well.  The atmosphere was fine - I only wish I could say the same for the service.

We entered to find the place full, but could see that there were several tables waiting to pay.  There was no hostess to greet us and we waited awhile at the door to be acknowledged.  Once we were approached, they cleaned a table and we were quickly seated.  

We filled out our order form, then patiently waited to be acknowledged by our waitress (the place was really clearing out, so not busy at this point).  Once she approached us (there was no \"greeting\" involved), we ordered our beverage, our food, and a to-go order for a friend who could not join us at the restaurant.  We were asked several times to clarify our order - which was written on the order form - and we verbally gave the order for two rolls to-go.  Seemed pretty straightforward, but apparently not.  

Eventually we received our beverages - delivered by the other waitress, which leads me to believe our waitress was under 21 (could explain the lack of experience?).  In any case, we were then served a white wine when we ordered red - and had to send that back - which then took them forever to deliver.  The food also took unreasonably long to come (though there were rolls sitting on the counter), and when the Caterpillar roll was finally delivered to us, it was represented as something else completely (that we had not ordered) - so the waitress had to clarify with the sushi chefs what she was serving us. 

I can only hope the service improves because the sushi was very good - maybe getting take out is the way to go here?!"}
{"text":"This is my second time trying (and reviewing) Katana. Since under new ownership, I thought I'd give it another try. I really should have given it 2.5 stars, but since the wait staff was so nice, they get a 3. I really, really wanted to give this local restaurant a great review.

My friend and I ordered Sake off the bat. We both took a big sip-- of heated VINEGAR! Whether it was sake that had turned, or if the apologetic waiter had poured from the wrong bottle, I'll never know... But it literally started the meal on a sour note. 

I had 3 rolls-- the Philly, Tuna and the Hot lover. The Hot Lover roll was the only one that was memorable, because it contained jalapeno... But even that one was just meh. The rolls weren't all that flavorful.

Will I go back? Yes- but only because it's the only sushi restaurant in Fountain Hills. But I won't take any out of town visitors here."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I have found!  Very fresh, good service and a nice smaller atmosphere. The owner really takes pride in his business and it shows!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years when I lived in FH and now when I visit my parents. The previous owners were great, it quickly became our favorite sushi place in town and nearby scottsdale. With the new owners, I'd like to say wow. The fish is so fresh. The previous owners had good fish but this is superb. We rank this probably one of the best sushi restaurants in the valley. We prefer to do the sushi combo because the chef picks the most fresh fish and it's amazing every time. This is now a must go when I visit my parents."}
{"text":"Good service, good food as always !! Very cozy & relaxing atmosphere"}
{"text":"Right here in fountain Hills we have one of the best sushi places around! The menu is extensive the quality is first rate and the service is impeccable. If I was really smart I would come back once a week for the nine dollar special - two yummy regular rolls. Try Hot Guy!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in town. There are many many options for sushi. Everything is beautifully presented and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Charming place, good food, nice owners.

Got the sushi combo lunch special...great deal. 

I'd come here again."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered the bento box so I can try lots of things. Chicken teriyaki, veg tempora, spring rolls, house salad, gyoza and miso soup 

Pros
- super friendly staff. Stellar really 
- place is packed with good energy and staff knows many of the customers 
- big portions 

Cons:
- almost nothing had flavor!!! 
- I asked for different sauces so I can give things flavor and they really just had siracha not even a chili or hot mustard 
- chicken was dry 
- by the time I got home my tummy was churning SO bad ... needless to say I was in the bathroom while :("}
{"text":"Our newest favorite sushi place! The selection of sushi rolls is outstanding. The service is always excellent. If you do the pick 2 or 3...it's very affordable. We often only spend about $40 on sushi. The range goes from basic (inexpensive) up to more elaborate (expensive) rolls. 

We have dined in as well as ordered \"carry out\" several times and they have always been quick with our order. It is a small, quaint restaurant and it truly feels like a family owned sushi place. It is not very close to our house but the food & service are worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!! Omg!  Good food.  Friendly service. Clean environment!!  Great food!!  They have TVs up to watch sports. It's a great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"These reviews have to be fake. If you think this is the best sushi, then you haven't had sushi! 
What good chef mixes pickled cucumber with eel sauce and then spicy mayo (with eel, salmon and/or crab)??? Horrible flavor combo!! Which you'd know to avoid if they actually provided a descriptive menu that ALL ingredients were included on. In their infinite wisdom they feel it's best to bother their waitstaff asking what's in each roll. While they're busy. Expecting them to remember each detail. Accurately. And the customer too. That's setup for disappointment. 
Only reason we didn't send 3 rolls back was because we didn't want our very sweet server to get reprimanded. Also wishing to skip the long wait. Which wouldn't have been so long if the sushi chef just handed us our plates instead of setting them down for 5 minutes where we could drool over them, but not reach them. Instead, we had to wait for the waitress to pick up the plates and move them 18\". If not less. 
That's the other thing, I've eaten sushi for 25 years, love sitting at the sushi bar and joking with the chef, enjoying personality, and making up our own rolls to try. Not this guy. Zip for personality. 
Sorry. If you want to increase revenue, provide menus with detailed descriptions of every roll (encourages sales while preventing food being sent back). Put some kid friendly dishes on your happy hour (it'll draw in parents who don't want the hassle and want a quick healthy meal). Have a soup and salad combo that makes sense finically. And encourage your sushi chef to engage in conversation and some personality. 
Sincerely, A restaurant consultant"}
{"text":"We had Egg roll, Yakisoba, Fountain Hill roll, Rainbow roll, Caterpillar roll.

Food: Good
Service: Great
Price: Acceptable
Ambience: Good. Welcoming."}
{"text":"Very good selection of sushi rolls to fit just about every taste. Very friendly and low-key. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time visiting Katana sushi
It was quit far but it is really worth it.
Food: Rolls were bigger than any other sushi bars i have visited so far and also really fresh
The best rolls were Marilyn monroe, October fest and Lion kings but other rolls were good too
I loved that they have enough sauces on rolls
I tried Calamari tempura and shrimp tempura and i loved them both. The best thing was that they were really crispy (went well with drinks)
People might think that they are quit expensive but if you get ure orders on ure tables.. you will realize that they arent expensive at all
Service: They were all nice and kind..It made me feel so happy because everybody was helping eachother
Im looking forward to try other rolls and sashimi 
P.S. Tuna Sashimi was one of my favorite because i had same ones in different restaurant and they were alittle bitter but the ones here tasted really fresh..You should give it a try if you like sashimi"}
{"text":"We were really happy with the Crispy Rice Spicy Tuna $9.00. It comes with a big salad in the center, which was a nice surprise. I thought that the portion size was good and I would order it again. 

We also ordered the Hotty Fiesta Roll $16.00, which features spicy salmon, cream cheese, jalapeno, cucumber, spicy krab, as well as more salmon and sliced jalapeno on top. The toppings were ponzu sauce, sriracha, masago, and green onion. I don't often see salmon-centric rolls other than Philly or Bagel sushi rolls so I really enjoyed  this one. It was very spicy.

Others in our party ordered the chicken bowl $8 and two chicken hot plates $11. Oddly, the middle portion of the chicken (on one of the chicken hot plates) was cold. Is that because they cook the chicken way in advance before putting it on the hot plate? That was really weird. The presentation was good, it reminds me of Chili's fajita dish. But was a bummer that it was partially cold. I would like to hear what others have experienced with their chicken hot plates.

To round out the meal, we also had edamame (basic), gyoza (which were hot and crispy), as well as some chocolate mochi. Overall, Katana is a great addition to Fountain Hill's dining options."}
{"text":"I usually order to go, the rolls are great and inexpensive!  Call ahead, Easy to pick up and take home after work."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants in town. The prices are great, the food is always wonderful and the staff is always friendly... You need to give them a try. My boyfriend did not eats sushi when we started going here and only would eat their chicken and vegetable dish, he now will share some of my sushi ,sometimes you have to start people out slow :-)"}
{"text":"Went with a groupon in hand but have been here before The prices are a tad higher than others, I don't think $4 for an Lipton Iced tea or a watered down Green tea are worth it, so got a Kirin. The place has a limited dinner menu, sushi is mostly ordered. 
I had the battered shrimp and calamari and it was great. 
My hubby asks every Japanese restaurant we go in if they have this item with an egg and beef over rice, he used to eat years ago in Japan and they didn't make it.  Anyone know what dish I'm speaking of?"}
{"text":"I live in North Scottsdale now but every time I head into Fountain Hills I make it a priority to eat here. Very fair prices and very good food"}
{"text":"Great sushi!!  Real friendly staff especially Michelle. Everythings clean. I would go out of my way again to come here."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, however they changed the sushi chef and now the sushi is disgusting. The staff was rude and the table was sticky. I would never never go back!"}
{"text":"Really great Japanese restaurant . Fair price and fresh sushi .
Lucky this place is in fountain hills."}
{"text":"Always wonderful service and great food! One of very few good places to eat in fountain hills"}
{"text":"Great deal on the 3 rolls for $12   
Nice people. The tuna, eel and salmon rolls are great for $12.  Spider roll is anther favorite.  Best and only sushi in fountain hills."}
{"text":"Since 2014 new owners took over this place and they now have rocking sushi. I am so down with this place, it's our only sushi bar in Fountain Hills, but it is still pretty awesome. The Sushi chef always goes that extra mile to impress me with new rolls and fresh seafood. I have had both dine-in and take-out always the best. Cheers"}
{"text":"Love this place for many reasons. The sushi is fresh and amazing and fountain hills is super cute. We have always walked in and never had to wait. Coming from California I thought it could be katana like on sunset (lol) because they have sushi roku here in Scottsdale - it is not the same. Not high end and trendy like the katana I know but the sushi is yummy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! We drive all the way from scottsdale! Shout out to Peter for his fab service! Shout out to the owners for never closing the restaurant on us! The sushi is awesome and the service is even better!!!"}
{"text":"Many complain about prices...but think about it....it is the desert...and you get what you pay for.  The food is excellent, creative and is some of the best sushi I have had in any city.  The complainers should just go to Denny's and get an early bird meal.  Those who appreciate good sushi and a small quite spot will love this!   It is relaxing...don't expect a quick grab and go meal."}
{"text":"The food is decent and they give out big portions so you'll never leave hungry. Service is great, but the waitress had the giggles. Everything she said was followed by this little girl laugh, which might sound cute, but was actually kind of weird.

The spirit bomb is my favorite dish there, but their sushi is really good. Another favorite is the crunch target. Atmosphere is typical for a sushi place.

Everyone is polite and warm, and the one time I had bones in my sushi so they apologizef, brought me a new one, comped my meal and even gave me a free dessert. It's service like that that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Katana sushi was DELICIOUS!  It is a cute \"mom and pop\" type place.  The service was a little slow, but the food absolutely made up for it!  The Hot Lover Roll, the crunchy roll, and the Lobster roll were out of this WORLD!  The atmosphere was really laid back and fun-not overly dressy but definitely a great first date establishment!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem.  Great sushi, huge portions and diverse menu.  Super friendly staff.  So happy this is in fh."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!  Finally in a city of non apologetic mediocrity, a restaurant exists that is good!  I did get a meal to go and other than a ridiculous small amount of rice, the dish was wonderful. And the lady who worked there seemed genuinely happy to help me. Imagine that?"}
{"text":"I eat sushi constantly and get extremely excited about when I find sushi places with good reviews.
I was extremely disappointed about this place though. 

The rolls were alright, nothing really special about them but that wasn't the worst part. 

I ordered a roll with crab in it and when I ate the first piece, I realized they hadn't taken out all the crab shell. It was crunchy and disgusting. 
 I lost my appetite after there. 

This is the only sushi place around my house and looks like I'll be traveling 30 minutes for sushi now."}
{"text":"We are nearly regulars now and love the food and service every time. Highly recommend everyone give Katana a try, they really do a nice job."}
{"text":"I love Katana! Their lunch specials are out of this world - a LOT of sushi (or a bento box or Raman if you're not a sushi fan) for a very affordable price. I come here multiple times a week and love the fish quality, friendly service, and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and by far the latest owner has produced the best sushi yet! I've loved everything I've ever ordered."}
{"text":"Decent sushi place but no happy hour on rolls or appetizers. Found it difficult to choose rolls w/o spicy tuna. Pleasant staff!"}
{"text":"I found Katana one day on accident and decided to give it a try. First visit was 5 stars, the Mafia Roll was the best I've had in a long time (this made me extremely happy since I LOVE sushi) The second time I got the same roll yet for take out, when I got it home it looked and ended up tasting different yet I gave it a try. Definitely not as good as the first yet not horrible. Third time I got take out again and I couldn't eat it. The seaweed it was rolled in was definitely not fresh. It was overly chewy. Went with a friend two different times for lunch and all was delicious as well as the server is ALWAYS super friendly made for a great lunch. Recently I returned alone to have lunch ordered the Marilyn Monroe roll which I ordered previously when I was there with a friend and when it arrived it was totally different from the previous time which confused me, I thought I either order the wrong roll or the server accidentally did yet when I ask they confirmed it was the Marilyn Monroe roll? It tasted good just NOT what I wanted or expected. One of the sushi chefs came over an asked how everything was. I replied good but not prepared as the last time. He also double checked even with the other sushi chef only for the same answer. He explained there are several chefs and that could be why, yet they would make a point to get on the same page so the food is consistent. Fair enough but I still ended up eating something that I didn't care for as much I what I've previously ordered. As much as I want to 5 star this place I can't until the food consistency improves. It won't keep me from going there yet I'd like to be able to order a roll and it be the same as the last time"}
{"text":"It actually stings a little writing a bad review for Katana as this once was one of my favorite sushi places. 

1) no happy hour on Fridays.
2) no service, there is one guy in the back washing dishes and the sushi chef. 

I have been here on multiple occasions and last night was the last.  Each time the service got worse and worse, the last time I ate here we were there for three hours, the first thing we ordered came out last!  Last night the restaraunt was busy, we were seated and stated we would like to order some drinks.  The sushi chef walked away.  Needless to say we left after that.  

The sushi is good, poki tuna and the Katana roll are my favorites on the menu but it's definitely not worth the wait.  If you do end up eating here be prepared to stay for a few hours."}
{"text":"Amazing local sushi resturant. Excellent food and service. Family owned business in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"I don't really like the ambiance of this sushi place.. Maybe the owner should consider to upgrade, renovate or deep clean the restaurant. The chairs/tables are old & sticky and it smells funky which it's hard for me to explain. But we love the food, friendly people. For right now, we are just happy to order over the phone and pick up the food."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and fire cracker appetizer. Reasonably priced. You'll leave extremely full and happy. Portion sizes are great. Loved it. The original owner and chef sold the place, sad to see him go he was a great guy! The new chef is great to! Although twice I got home to find I had been given the wrong order. But it was really good! Even though I'll never know what it was I ate.. Good food!"}
{"text":"We are youngish professionals who moved to FH a year ago. We really enjoy Katana...especially since the new menu was released a few months ago....Added more of the creative sashimi dishes!

We don't get rolls here (we don't like fried food or mayo)...but we LOVE LOVE LOVE their sashimi! Really good!

We order their tuna tataki salad, rainbow sashimi plate, poke bowl, albacore salad, snapper...all fantastic! Great service too. 

Only wish is they would switch from smooth jazz music to Japanese or Hip Acoustic Loft style music :-)"}
{"text":"Went here over memorial weekend and had fantastic service and delicious food! I will return next time I'm in the area! 
Great service, delicious food and affordable!"}
{"text":"I LOVE KATANA. lunch prices are reasonable and very filling for sushi. My boyfriend didn't love the ramen but highly recommends the sushi rolls. I prefer nigiri and sashimi. Tonight I got the rainbow salad ($12). IT WAS AMAZING. it contains seaweed salad, 6 pieces of sashimi, shrimp with spicy tuna underneath, avocado, masago, and cabbage. Guess what! there's four pieces of nigiri on the side! love it! Everything tasted rather fresh. I also recommend the 3 roll combo ($12). I think I got charged a little extra... but that's okay! For my 3 regular rolls I got Hot Guy, Spicy Tuna, and Tuna Roll."}
{"text":"Small and local, but some of the best sushi in the area.  We love to meet up with family here or go just for a Date Night.  The salads are cool and crisp, the staff is friendly, and the sushi is consistently good.  No doubt this is \"our place\" for sushi!!"}
{"text":"As we pass this restaurant, walking to Starbucks, we decided to grab lunch. Our server was welcoming. Very cordial and knowledgeable about the menu. My boyfriend and I had a bento box, vegetable roll, miso soup and mafia roll. All of it was highly pleasing to the tastebuds. The restaurant it self is clean and we'll definitely return with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Katana! It is the only place for sushi in Fountain Hills and it is yummy! It's very casual, I've shown up in yoga pants and a t shirt. They don't carry hard liquor, beer and wine only, so no cocktails. Not a huge deal but notable. 

The prices are excellent. I generally get the 3 regular rolls for $12. It always fills me up. The lobster roll, though, will knock your socks off. I could eat that every day. 

Service is always good, too. Overall a really solid sushi place in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Mmmm...I love this place! Went with my hubby while driving around Fountain Hills one weekend. Stopped in for an early weeknight dinner and there was no waiting. The service was prompt and super friendly. We got sushi and edamame and two rolls. The sushi was fresh and soooo good! The only downside was they only serve beer and wine or sake, no hard alcohol so I couldn't get a MaiTai- LOL. The menu is huge and some of the rolls are very similar so they could fine tune their rolls a little, but the taste was awesome! Will make the drive out there again soon."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I just went here today for lunch. We work on E. Avenue of the Fountains so it was super close. 

We went at noon and the place was empty. It was sort of a bad sign, especially given the previous reviews, but we've been meaning to try this place out for a while. The waiter was very nice and attentive. The water is pretty gross tap water but the food was really great. It definitely exceeded my expectations. 

They have really good deals - Two of us did the buy 2 regular rolls for $9, which is a great price. The Vegas roll is even listed as a regular roll, instead of a specialty, which is great. Our other coworker did the lunch teriyaki chicken bowl which was $7, also a decent price. 

I got the Vegas roll and the spicy tuna and both were amazing. My friend got a regular salmon roll and an eel roll, which both tasted fresh and delicious. We also ordered eggrolls to start, which had good flavor but were steaming hot (which is good - they were obviously fresh) but they were quite oily and when you bit into them the piping hot oil keep coming out of the bottom and burning my hand. I probably wouldn't order those again, but the sushi was amazing. 

Their list of specialty rolls (about 2 double-sided pages!) looked great - I'll definitely have to try one of those next time.

Overall, service was great (but if they do get busy I'm sure it would go down if they still only had one server). The water isn't great and the egg rolls were rather oily but the sushi is worth going for! Prices aren't bad at all for good-quality sushi. You don't even have to wait for a happy hour since these deals are available all day. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Again, it really does pain me to give low stars but my experience there was quite terrible.

NOTE: I tried Katana several times in 2010 (when I first moved here) and wanted to see if they were new-and-improved in 2013. For me, they've gotten worse.

I was craving sushi one night so I called for take-out of salmon sashimi, Philly roll and Rainbow roll. The girl who took my order (Brittany) said it would be ready in 25 min. Okay - great! See you then!

I gave them 30 minutes (just in case they were slammed). Showed up and Brittany seemed a little flustered and kept apologizing that my order wasn't ready and made a quick phone call. Okayyy. Mind you - no one is sitting in the dining area. No one.

After 5 or 10 min, a couple of patrons came in and were seated. Still not ready.

More time elapsed and the sushi chef (don't know his name) came through the main entrance w/a box of food. Thought I caught a glimpse of cucumber and perhaps other veggies. More time elapsed.

Chef apologized to me and said \"5 more minutes\" - I nodded and smiled. Finally order came out (WAYYYY over-priced too).

After about an hour wait (total), the sushi was quite disgusting - I must say. Way too salty and it just tasted \"warm\" in some wierd way. Salmon sashimi was pretty decent - good cuts and okay quality. That was the only thing I finished.

Will not be returning here in the near future - but, I still have hopes for this place to turn itself around."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've had in the valley. The staff are friendly and fast! They also have great prices on the regular rolls and the cucumber avocado roll is a favorite if the vegans in the family."}
{"text":"Katana has a mom and pop charm to it and the food is consistently delicious! I literally have been dreaming of the dressing on the tuna tetaki salad because it is so so good! We had to come back in less than a week just so I could enjoy it!! The service is also friendly though you have to be patient when they are packed...but that's the price you pay for delicious and fresh food. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We stopped off for dinner to find the restaurant busy. There were at least  4 groups totaling 12 people and 1 waitress and 1 sushi chef. 

It seems each time we go there, there is a different server. She just didn't know the menu or how to check on her customers. Several times, the chef had to come over and wait on his patrons. He actually took our order.

We were served green salad with too much dressing for the amount of salad we had. The soup was luke warm. Our sever disappeared for a while. Good thing the Olympics was on to help pass the time.

My wife ordered the Tempura dinner and a dragon roll and I had the Chirashi with Seaweed salad. The Tempura was quite good but the problem was that it was brought out first and by the time I received my food, she had finished hers. 
Some of my fish in my Chirashi was butchered and sushi rice was not soft and fluffy.
The Dragon roll was good, but could have been much larger. Most sushi houses give you a nice FAT roll."}
{"text":"Fountain Hills is a tough market for restaurants. Just barely enough of a population to make a go at it (especially in the summer). Choices for dining out are limited unless you really like pizza and burgers. I have been a customer of Katana (old owner) for a number of years, and while I did have some decent meals there, it was nothing spectacular. I just visited Katana for the 2nd time since under new ownership (ownership change in Jan 2014), and the meal was very good. The fish was fresh (not sure if farm raised or wild caught). I ordered four various rolls to go (Katana, Garlic Tuna, Lemon Salmon, and one more) and the Tuna Tataki salad. Total wait time was 15 minutes. Total came to about $60. I was happy to see the place about 50% full. Last thing you want to see is a sushi restaurant in the middle of the desert with no customers... makes you think about how old the fish is that you are eating for sure!. I will be a customer again here."}
{"text":"I doubt there's a bad dish here.  I do need to caution people not to order too many rolls as the portions are HUUUUUUUUUGE!  They're certainly not what were used to back home and we have great sushi. Our two favourites and must haves are the Heart Attack and Hot Night Rolls.  We WILL be back not doubt about that!"}
{"text":"We came here for a later, lighter dinner. We had a person in our group that wasn't a fan of fish so they wanted more of the vegetarian type rolls. We had a large lunch so we decided to split 4 rolls between the 4 of us instead of each getting 2 rolls like we usually would if we were eating a full dinner. So we ordered the Dragon roll, spicy Dragon roll, veggie roll and california roll. Personally, I don't like the California roll because it's a basic roll but theirs is good and fresh so I appreciated it. I really liked the Dragon roll. The shrimp seemed to be a little small for it but then again, I am used to huge fresh shrimp due to living in Cali. It did offer large pieces of eel on top though so that definitely made up for it. And the avocado that tops it was very fresh and not browning at all so you know it was good. The portion was the normal size, I think we got about 6-8 pieces from it. I didn't try the spicy Dragon simply because my husband did and said it would be too spicy for my taste. He said the topping and sauce was very spicy but loved it- get this if you like spicy! The veggie roll was interesting because it had a salad like quality to it. It has lettuce and kale in it. I thought it was very clever that they did it. I actually would get this one again and use it as a pallet cleanser between bites of a heavier roll. The service was quick, took about 20 minutes for all of them. We took it too go so we didn't get enough soy sauce or chopsticks so double check that if you get a to go order."}
{"text":"Loves, I'm the sushi chef at home and I make fresher, and tastier sushi than a restaurant up the road from me. The sushi rice was tough and hard, not steamy and fresh out of the rice cooker... like it was just sitting there for hours y'know. 

The fish did not taste fresh to me, and I always make my sushi fresh at home. My step-father even looked up at me as we where eating and said... \"I'm spoiled at home... really I am.\" 

I laughed but silently agreed with him. 

The Price: Ridiculous. Period. 

Who wants to pay $65 for sushi that tastes bad when I could have made the same amount for around $10 and it taste terrific. Never again. 

The only thing I like about the place is the amazing waiter... she's friendly and does so much work that I really appreciate her.  You go girl!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places. The sushi is so fresh. The variety of sushi rolls is wonderful. I love all the different flavors bursting in my mouth. All the other food I have tried is very good as well. The wait staff is always very nice and we are well taken care of always. I love this place and the atmosphere is relaxing and cozy. I highly recommend this place."}

After trying a few other spots in town with no luck, we ended up at Katana Sushi & Grill.  I am glad we did.  I love sushi and am always looking for great sushi and have no problem that our previous dinner plans fell through.

We arrived at what appeared to be \"closing time\" but this did not seem to phase the manger/owner of the establishment, as he warmly greeted our party and welcomed us to his sushi house.

We loved the atmosphere.  It was beautifully decorated, very authentic with lovely Japanese music playing softly in the background.  The place seemed spacious, even though it was small--great decorator to supply that open feeling while being in such a small space. 

The menu was what you would expect at a sushi place with all the usual staples.  There were a few \"special\" offerings wherein you could order a larger portion of items or add small sides to your sushi choices, which was nice.  We always like to color outside the lines ;)

After ordering and then enjoying about 10 rolls, some sashimi and nigiri we were about full.  We were staying in a hotel in the area so I really did not want to take sushi to go, but my partner did...so, anyway...
 
I really loved the staff, the service and the freshness of the sushi.  If I am ever in Arizona again I will definitely try Katana Sushi & Grill again.

{"text":"The fish is all farm raised & the crabmeat imitation. They do not buy or use anything wild caught.. I have never known a sushi restaurant besides this one who does not use fresh wild caught fish.  The seaweed saladis overpriced for the amount you get but it sure is good.. the veggies rolls, avocado rolls are are very tasty. I tried the jalapenobomb and it was good & not very hot.  The stools are small & hard. The lunch specials are nothing to write home about.  If you are craving sushi & live in town a decent place to go but I would not drive up from Scottsdale or Mesa to go here, there are so nsny other great sushi places. JOHN the waiter was very helpful"}
{"text":"Surprised to have a good sushi place like this in Fountain Hills.  Can get expensive, but eat in or take out is always great.  Fun to mingle with the chef while making the sushi."}

{"text":"Wonderful service Fresh fish and Excellent service and the owner is a joy to talk to.. I highly recommend especially if you have family town."}
{"text":"We recently discovered this wonderful sushi restaurant! We are new to sushi and the staff there is so helpful teaching us all about sushi. What an absolutely awesome place this is! Will be going back a LOT in the future!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, really fresh, tastes really good. They have so many kinds of sushi. My husband and I love the hot night, crunch rolls. Would recommend asking for take out drinks are a little expensive for a can of soda. But overall really good food."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing.  Can't decide which one was our favorite They are all fabulous.  Our service staff, Lauren, was exceptional.  she was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Had Chirashi bowl to go for lunch. Friendly service, fresh fish and nice atmosphere. Been there twice same great experience from 2 different servers but same sushi chef."}
{"text":"What a delicious lunch! The sushi was great and very reasonably priced. We especially loved the Spirit Bomb, Rainbow Salad, Heart Attack, and Hot Lover. This is a charming restaurant, and the service was great. We will definitely be back if we ever visit this area again!"}
{"text":"Love it here! I always get the Hot Lover (but without jalapeño) sooooo delicious. My boyfriend and I always get the pick two roll combo for $9. Very friendly people, love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was welcomed by both servers.  Sushi was fresh and very tasty.  Baked Lobster roll was amazing.  Beer was cold and the service was absolutely phenomenal.  Not from the area, but will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my whole family loves Japanese food and have even been to Japan. We're Fountain Hills residents and desperately wanted a local Japanese restaurant to eat at. Unfortunately, Katana will not be that place. We've eaten at this place twice (gave it a second chance after the first bad experience) and both times have been the worst Japanese food we've ever had. I'm not sure if the owners are even Japanese because I would imagine that they should know how to make their own food."}
{"text":"Katana has typical Japanese hospitality and excellent service.  I felt as I was part of the family with the type of service we received.  In addition, there were a wide array of interesting rolls.  I forgot the exact name of the roll, but it was a spicy crab roll with avocado and a tangy type sauce.  It tasted absolutely perfect with the right balance of spice and tangy/sweet flavors.  

This location is very close to the actual large fountain in Fountain Hills.  Next time I take some visitors on a tour, I will definitely make a stop at Katana!"}
