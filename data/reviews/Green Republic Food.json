{"text":"This is certainly my favourite coffee/lunch place ! They have several stations serving build your own salads and sandwiches in addition to a grab and go fridge for when you are in a rush. Options are endless to suite every taste.  The quality of the ingredients and prices are great. Coffee is amazing and so are the pastries. 
Definitely recommend, large space and suitable for large groups.
Staff are knowledgeable and provide great customer service.
5 stars for taste, location, customer service and price."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and very fresh but don't come in a hurry!  They need better systems for getting and paying for food and way more staff to make everything run smoothly!  If they fix these problems it would go from 3 stars to 5"}
{"text":"I've only had their bowls here. The staff are so friendly and knowledgeable and always make great recommendations. The quality of their ingredients and condiments are top notch, especially for the price you pay."}
{"text":"New fav lunch spot that has fresh tasty eats made with quality local ingredients. I like that it can be a different eating experience every visit - whether you are creating your own sandwich, salad, bowl, ceviche or poke, there are tons of choices to customize your meal. My go-to is the Moroccan lamb stew on saffron quinoa with caramelized onions, homemade slaw, and pickled carrot (I sub an extra veg for the cheese option) topped with spicy raita. Vegetarian options available. The space is very open, bright and clean. The communal tables don't bother me. Even the coffee bar is amazing! Nothing bad can be said about this place except get ready to line up during the rush time hours. The sandwich/bowl lineup is probably the longest but 100% worth the wait. Also, price is very reasonable for the caliber of food.  Can't wait for that pasta bar to open!

Bonus: they cater and have private dining for special events"}

{"text":"So good! High quality ingredients and delicious flavours. I also love the atmosphere here. Best lunch spot in the area"}
{"text":"Accidentally discovered this place located at the back of a office building.  It's a great venue and nice setup front of house, but most importantly they have fresh pasta made to order!!  I knew I was going to be happy when they picked up a block of parm!  Real cheese!! And also the herbs and garnish is plucked right off the plant.

Food was fantastic, but if you show up at the strike of 12 or later, be prepared to wait.  They're just not efficiently set up.  The guy cooking my pasta had to run around the block it seemed.  The water for pasta was one location, the induction burner another, supplies another.  I'm sure the dude would have run a marathon for a lunch service.

If they could ever pick up the speed, this will make my weekly rotation."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches and pasta are really good. The service, however, is trash. The pasta station is open maybe 1 in 20 days, seemingly whenever they feel like it. They're always critically understaffed. Though I appreciate that they make your sandwich with care, they really aren't in a rush about it. On an average day at lunch time you will be standing in line for ~30 minutes. I think the #1 problem there is management."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on recommendation by a colleague. Very fresh and wholesome food. There is a sandwich bar with options for different bases including greens or carbs, a salad bar, pasta station, what looks like to be Sushi and poke station and coffee bar. Also has a open fridge for premade sandwiches. I tried the salad bar. There are small and large sizes but you pay per 100 grams. It's a salad bar with service and you build your own salad. Great selection of different types of greens including kale, spinach, mixed greens and others. I like the roasted Brussel sprouts option as an item however some were under cooked. Different proteins available including chicken, tofu chickpeas, etc. Great selection of other salad toppings. The corn topping is fresh from the Cobb. There are 7-8 different freshly made dressings available. My salad tasted great and fresh. There is a water station with 3 different options for sparkling and 2 types of flat water. I tried the coffee bar and a cherry danish. This is one of best danish I have had in awhile. It is freshly baked crisp with fresh berries baked and great custard inside. My latte was as expected the espresso is quite strong. Communal tables only set back. There are some comfy looking sofas. Overly great lunch spot with fresh and wholesome ingredients at salad bar. Will definitely come back to try other stations. Was disappointed that the sushi poke station and pasta station was not yet set up despite the menu on the wall. Hopefully this will be available soon.

Update February 20, 2018
I've been here a few times lately and this place has deteriorated significantly. The sushi poke station is gone no one works that area. The salad area has staff that don't know what they're doing and mixing up orders. The ingredients for the salads are still similar to previous visits but they no longer make all of the dressings on the wall menu only 3 and the girl putting them on doesn't know what container is what dressing. She didn't put enough dressing for the large salad I ordered. They don't mix the salad well. I ended up with bland salad with no real dressing. Long line ups and slow service. The staff is not experienced. Not well run anymore. Not sure if I would return given the current quality and management."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible. Very fresh and the sandwich bar is fantastic. The design of the place gives you a positive vibe. Suitable for large groups too. The staffs are very friendly and professional. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very good place fast and fresh food. Great location near the court on University st. I would recommend it and would go back anytime"}
{"text":"The one bad thing: the line/it takes long to make the food. They take their time crafting your food, so it always turns out nice, but if you're in a rush you may be there a while.  I normally get the tuna on panini with red cabbage slaw, onion and lettuce, they toast it nicely and their spreads are wonderful. It comes with a side salad for 11$. I keep going back!"}
{"text":"This place is spacious and very clean. Got an industrial feeling to it. The food is very tasty and I like that they have a lot of gourmet toppings for sandwiches and boxes. You get to build your own sandwich or box so you're not stuck with items you don't like. 

However, the there were two big flaws: service/organization and availability of food. 

The place is very poorly organized. I came in and didn't know if I paid first or ordered first. No one there to guide or tell me. Also no signage.

I came in here just before noon and the place was not very busy. I ordered a box but the first three things I asked for (based on their menu) were all unavailable. Chicken confit? Nope. Turkey? Not available. Eggplant? Not ready yet, be a few minutes. I said I'd wait and then they fessed up and said they don't know how long it'll take. It was comical at this point. The signs/menu list out so many options but maybe it's a fake menu and only certain things are available at a given time. 

Once I finally got my food no one wanted to cash me out. I just stood around trying to get someone's attention. There were 3 cash registers throughout the store but no one there to cash me out. I finally waited behind someone ordering a salad and I paid after her salad was made. There are workers just wandering around prepping but no one to service customers. Not sure how this place survives under pressure of a busy lunch rush. Probably why this place is not in the path. 

The food was really tasty so I hope it it survives, but highly disappointed with my experience."}
{"text":"Love this place, I make it a point to get lunch here at least once a week. They said everything is made in-house so bonus points for wholesome, nutrient-dense ingredients. I love their grab and go selection as well. Some of my fav are the chicken and avo sandwich (bread is on point!), date greek yogurt, and they have soups as well that come in mason jars.. prices are amazing. Their pastries are also delicious, and very well priced.
The line-ups get long during lunch, I think they still need a better system.. but you get to custom-build your own sandwiches/bowls. Also, depends on who you get making your bowl, the amount of protein is.. tiny. I really wish they can be more consistent with the portion sizes.
But other than that, solid food, great service, and it's always good to support local businesses. 
They will get pasta, and poke bars in the future..so I can't wait for that."}
{"text":"An awesome place to stop by for a morning coffee as they offer an incredibly tasty coffee drinks. This place is made for true healthy food lovers with variations of veggie selection and sea foods.
Lobster Poke is my fav and can't wait to go there again and eat 2 servings this time!
Everything in this place is wisely offered to its customers.
Being a choosy person, I've never come across even a tiny matter related to the quality of the food or service.
I wish they were open on weekends as well."}
{"text":"Creative, delicious, foodie heaven. Do yourself a favor and keep the flavors simple. It's easy to complicate with all the choices. Love the concept, the preparation, quality and taste."}
