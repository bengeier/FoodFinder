{"text":"I had a really great brunch experience here. The place is not too packed during Sunday brunch hour, and the food was VERY good. However, I can't fathom ever going to Dive any other time. I've tried during happy hour and I've tried later in the evening, and wow. It's so PACKED, and there is no order or rhyme or reason at all once you get in the door. There's no hostess or waitress available to help sort the mess of people waiting in the tiny entryway. It was a mess. Maybe I'll give it another shot sometime, but for now I'll just stick to brunch."}
{"text":"A great addition to our neck of Lawrenceville.  I generally work late and hit this place on my way home. The staff is always friendly and certainly not bitter about a late order which I really appreciate. The food is solid for bar food and I've had a pretty decent variety of things off their menu. Good burger. Good fish sammich. Good fries. Definitely glad to have this place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I have come here many times and are never disappointed.  The staff is very attentive to your needs and there has never been a time where I felt like receiving our food or drinks had a long wait period.  The food is great! I have tried everything from the brunch menu , to lunch and dinner.  This is always our go to place. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fairly regular bar. Has a bit of a generic though upbeat atmosphere. Gimmicky food and okay drinks put it lower on my list of Lawrenceville options when so many better options are nearby."}
{"text":"This place is probably more appropriate for the suburban mom and dad desperately clinging to youth kind of folk, and even then....  The food was underwhelming. Not a lot of flavor, over-sized portions, standard restaurant fare that thinks it's menu is unique and interesting but is really just another TGIFridays without the chain.   Another big complaint goes to the douchebag, dead-behind-the-eyes, meathead owner. A smile would be nice."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place, but it has suffered a bit. The wait staff is fantastic, but the food portions have gone down hill.  When ordering a shrimp po' boy sandwich recently, I ordered fries, because the Asian slaw has lacked flavor recently.  There were 4 shrimp and not as many fries as I'm used to.  I obviously don't NEED the fries, but that's part of why we loved the place. I would get the tots, but there were 8 the last time I ordered them.  Overall, the portions have diminished significantly. It's been bipolar, too, because the portion of ahi tuna I received was fantastic. They're cutting back on the cheap ingredients but keeping the bigger portions for the more expensive ones. They're raising prices and cutting portions.  Bad news."}
{"text":"My friends and I chose to go during a Ronald McDonald House fundraiser, where part of the bill went to the foundation during brunch hours. If a portion of my bill, however, had not gone to charity I probably would have refused to pay. Upon arrival we were not greeted by any staff, seated, or instructed to seat ourselves. We stood at the front of the restaurant confused for a few minutes when someone from Ronald McDonald even remarked that the restaurant wasn't prepared for the small crowd. It wasn't very packed at all and 8 of us sat down without waiting. Despite the restaurant only being moderately busy, it took nearly twenty minutes for a server to even come introduce herself and bring us water. She claimed she was late and no one told her this was her table, yet in the time before she showed up no one else on staff acknowledged us. We finally ordered and spent close to an hour waiting for our food. When it arrived only five of eight plates were brought out. Since the wait was so long those five began eating. About ten minutes later the rest of us asked why we hadn't received our food at which time our server ran back and immediately brought the last three plates out. It was cold. It was quite obvious that three plates of food were left sitting in the back during that time. I ordered a Reuben and tater tots. There were about six tater tots on my plate and the Ruben was barely cooked. There were two tomatoes on one side of the sandwich and none on the other, so I could never get a full bite of everything. The bread felt stale and overpowered everything else that was messily thrown into my plate. My friend remarked that her eggs Benedict were cold and not the runny consistency they should have been. The presentation of all the plates was terrible. One friend was given a side of scrambled eggs that barely filled half of the large plate they were on. I'm typically a big food instgrammer but there was nothing on our table that looked appetizing enough to even want to think about taking a picture of. When we finished eating it took another twenty minutes to take our plates and bring checks. Then another ten minutes to run our cards. All in all we were at the restaurant for over two hours for a meal that wasn't filling, wasn't prepared well, and was served with poor service. Our waitress never smiled, thanked us begrudgingly, and ignored us most times she passed the table. The place was understaffed, unprepared, and frankly, a morning ruiner. Sunday brunch should be a relaxing, enjoyable experience surrounded by friends; not the start to a bad day. If I had to describe Dive Bar in one word, it would simply be: abysmal."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint. The atmosphere is clean and friendly, the food is incredible, the prices are great (especially happy hour), and the portions are generous. I think this is the best, reasonably priced, casual restaurant in Lawrenceville. Good work."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night on a whim and was impressed. I only got the fried pickles even though I wanted everything on the menu, but they were some of the best I've ever had. The batter was different than most but delicious and their ranch seemed to have a light dill flavor to it which I enjoyed. Service was kind of slow but it was busy. I can't wait to come back to Dive."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch an got the Alabama burger with sweet potato tots. Both were quite good!! Burger was pretty big. Tater tot portion was average. Nice craft beer on draft. An the bar and staff were exceptionally nice and welcoming and  constantly checking on service an food quality, would give them a 5 stars rating. And i would revisit if i was on this side of town again and also recommend to friends. Place seems great for a good better quality lunch. But i can clearly see what others say about the size which could be an issue on a packed weekend evening."}
{"text":"Great good. Unique menu items, everything from appetizers to sandwiches and dinner.   Good beer menu.  The sweet potato tots were amazing.  It's not a dive, really cute inside."}
{"text":"First time here with a large group of  16. They were very accommodating and did not seem annoyed in the least with the large group. The food menu has a large selection to choose from. I got a Cobb salad my husband got the knuckle sandwich both of which was pretty big in portion size and very reasonably priced. We each had 2 drinks, him craft beers, me a Dive-Tini, and Orange Dragon. The Dive-Tini was mainly Riesling, but still tastey the Orange Dragon was much better. The only thing I regret is not trying the Sweet Potato tots and having more to drink. We will definitely come back here in the near future."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight for our daughters 30th birthday.  All I can say is our server Kristina was not in a good mood and we were well aware of it. We felt like we had no time to look over the menu and were rushed to place our order. My Pierogie quesadilla was amazing, but my sons chicken poppers and fries were completely over cooked. We had been here one other time for lunch and had a great experience. It just goes to show how important your server is to your total experience of dining out."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night alone after work to grab a bite to eat.  Bartender was good. Didn't talk much but was attentive and helpful with the menu.  Got the thai style steak salad. Was tasty. I thought maybe a little over priced for $12 but generally good.   Generally a good place to grab a bite to eat. I felt comfortable as a single girl sitting at the bar and I like that the kitchen is open till midnight. Will stop by again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Good food. Chicken parm sandwich is very good. Wings are good too!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. My partner and I have been here a couple of times before and it was pretty good, but today's experience was honestly one of the worst I've ever had in a restaurant.  We walked in and sat by the window, watched as the six top next to us (and the only other table occupied in the room) had their cards collected, swiped and brought back before we realized the server was ignoring us. There were less than 15 people in the entire place. I got up and went to the bar to ask if someone could come over, and the other server was sent over. It was 2.20 and we really wanted brunch (served till 3pm) although we were only given regular menus. As we were really hungry, we decided to switch to the bar to see if we could get better service there. I asked for a brunch menu and the bartender told me she would check if the kitchen could still make brunch...40 minutes before 3pm? She also seemed annoyed that we had ordered drinks through someone else. We didn't wait too long for food, and it was great. A friend came in to join us and order food, weirdly enough the bartender seemed keen to offer him the brunch menu instead of the regular one. As we were leaving she mentioned she'd had problems with the computer POS, but she'd be right back with our cards. A few hours later I checked my bank statement and saw that I'd been charged 3 times, with over $100 extra in charges. I called to enquire and the manager I spoke to was incredibly condescending, interrupting me repeatedly and explaining that the charges should fall off. He didn't apologize once, and to be honest I felt like I was inconveniencing him.   I'm not quite sure why our service was so bad- we've been before and never had a problem. Perhaps they were mad that we came in less than an hour before the special ended. I work in the industry, bartending on Saturday nights, so no, I don't get up early on Sunday mornings to be there for brunch at 10. I understand what it's like being annoyed and wanting to go home, but really the staff here completely ruin the great aspects of this place, like the food and atmosphere. Won't come back, will go back to Gus's as they're cheaper and don't treat their customers like crap."}
{"text":"Friendly and prompt service.  We sat at the bar and ordered food as the dining room was full.  Good chopped Caesar and average beer selection.  Buff chicken looked tasty.  Will go back again."}
{"text":"Going here was the single worst day of my life. I feel like this place is a joke and I'm on one of those Hell's Kitchen type of shows. The most boring generic menu ever created. Ugly decor.   This is a place your parents take you to because they are trying too hard to be hip.   Wow. A real masterpiece in horrible life choices.   I want to bleach my mind in hopes I forget this place exists."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was incredible.  Put it on the top of your list if your downtown."}
{"text":"Went to Dive Bar for happy hour and really enjoyed it. Love the beer list! The appetizers were big portions and half off during happy hour, which was great. I will definitely be back for happy hour soon."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection...great food!  I had the buffalo chicken strips on mac & cheese and it was great.   Xaz gave us great service. She was very helpful with navigating the menu. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Dive has a GREAT happy hour special complete with cheap drafts and smirnoff drinks. Most appetizers (which are full meal sized, by the way) are half off as well. Can't go wrong! I do find it amusing how \"hipster\" the establishment seeks to feel with tattooed employees and rustic decor... yet much of the clientele is overtly B&T, sigh (not Dive's fault).  The food is good, not amazing- but for the happy hour special, it's totally a bargain. Not a fan of the nachos with soggy amusement park cheese."}
{"text":"I had the fried bologna sandwich and it was excellent. Very friendly place and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"LOVE everything about this place. The BEST risotto I've ever had. Chef Ramsey would be Proud."}
{"text":"Honestly, I think this is one of the better restaurants in Lawrenceville. There is no gimmick like many places, it's just a solid bar to drink and eat at. There could be more seating, but they do well with the space that they have. The fry bowls here are so great! I've never had one that I didn't like. They are more than enough for a meal. The sandwiches are also amazing. I try to always get a different one each time I go. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I placed a pick-up order for a hamburger from Dive Bar and I was not disappointed. I ordered the smothered burger with double swiss, grilled onions and crimini mushrooms with horseradish aioli and a side of french fries. The burger was cooked to my medium rare specifications and came on a delicious soft bun, tomatoes and a nice mound of shredded lettuce. The burger was juicy and delicious - one of the best burgers I've enjoyed in Pittsburgh. The fries were cooked perfectly and were crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. I'm looking forward to my next meal from Dive Bar & Grill."}
{"text":"This is anything but a \"dive bar\" and only in Lawrenceville would you find such an ironic name for a place like this!  It is rare to find a place with great food, service, beer and a nice atmosphere but Dive has it all.  I have been for both brunch and dinner and the menu is huge, almost overwhelming. Also it never seems to be so crowded that you can't get a seat. Each time we had a great service both with big groups and the food was so tasty.  On my last visit I went with a turkey gouda sandwich that was grilled with a tomato aioli. You have your choice of fries, tator totes, chips or a homemade slaw. I went with the chips and they were just the right amount of crispy. Others in my party ordered various burgers which all looked amazing and the dinner choice of the evening was the pulled pork and mac and cheese quesadilla! Yum!  They have many draft and bottle beer options and i went with a peach wheat beer.  With so many menu items can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Four stars no problem. Happy hour 5 to 7 pm.  This place first shot was great! Nice menu, nice happy hour specials, free parking. All around great!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and well prepared creative cuisine.  Great creativity on the menu and well crafted beverages at the bar!  It's a great find in Lawrenceville so why suffer the bad service at Industry Public House?  Similar atmosphere, just better experience."}
{"text":"I came here with my roommate. We'd both never been. It was great!  I am giving it 5 stars not because it's the best place I've ever tried but the experience was up there.  Nothing over the top. We sat at the bar. The bar tender was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. He knew about the beers, offered a couple suggestions to get a feel of what we liked, let us try a sample before we got some different pints. He also offered us a menu. We ordered some food which was great - the buffalo chicken burger and house chips. Totally reasonably priced, too. The bartender checked in on us to make sure food was alright and to see if we wanted another drink. So - yes, dive bar but ... great service, food, drinks and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Loved this place on a Monday evening for happy hour. No fuss street parking out front, friendly  and attentive staff, drink specials and nicely diverse menu!   The tostado appetizer was great.  Dive chimmichanga and fish tacos were entre choices which we both loved. We will be back again - what a great way to ease into the work week.  Oh, the beer selections and drink options are vast. Great time!"}
{"text":"The food is very very good here.  One of the best burgers I've had (outside of Wingharts, seriously WINGHARTS).  It had a great char-grilled taste.  I don't think I've really ever had a horrible experience here but I've never had one that really stood out either.  They have Arsenal Cider on tap (which is ALWAYS a plus for me).  The drinks are decently priced, they have a little seated area separate from the bar and it also has a couple TV's for you sports-minded people. The bar has several TVS above it as well.   i've been in this location several times, back when it was Gino's then that terrible gastro pub that lasted for way too long (the owner was a misogynistic pig and made some very creepy passes at myself and other women), and now this Dive Bar & Grill.  I'm pleased with it being Dive, the food is good the drinks are cold everything is great!  I will definitely say that they are ALWAYS busy and sometimes it's hard to get a table.  Sucks for me.  Great for them!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the Porky vs Hamburgler was amazing, service was good, atmosphere was not bad, not too loud."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Dive for a few years, but the past few times I've been here it seems to be getting worse. I had friends in from out of town, and we were excited to have brunch. We walked in and were relieved that it wasn't busy. We were the only people in an entire section toward the back. We ordered 3 cokes, a water, and a mimosa. Took about 10 minutes for the mimosa. After we ordered (mind you this is the limited brunch menu), it was another 40 minutes until 3 out of 4 of us got our food. Mine came another 5 minutes later. I ordered a basic breakfast bowl: hash browns, a few veggies, and two eggs over easy. Look at the picture to see how my eggs came out. The waitress came once during the time we were waiting and told us they had a huge take out order so things were backed up. I saw someone walk out with 5 to go containers 10 minutes after we sat down, and no one else came in after to pick up to go food. Unfortunately, I won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim. Not a bad bar, it was a little cold inside, but the food and beer were good. I had the fries and they were really good. I would recommend them. It is not actually a dive bar. But, it is pretty small inside. I can't really find much to say about it. Not impressive, but solid. I would go back."}
{"text":"We have been to The Dive Bar several times now.  The service at the packed bar yesterday was stellar, Adam the bartender was attentive, witty and very helpful regarding menu choices.  The happy hour is affordable and the food fresh and delicious.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I work across the street from this place and they're always my first option for food ! I love trying new things on their menu and it's affordable and the portion speaks for the price. The staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to dive for our weekly date night. We like to try new restaurants and to our delight, we chose Dive this week! The menu looked delicious and was pretty reasonably priced. The drinks were a bit on the strong side, so if you like that, this is your place. The food was absolutely delicious (I got the pulled pool sandwich, yum!) and the staff was very sweet. I recommend going for sure!"}
{"text":"Dive Bar's modern/rustic/warm atmosphere is inviting. The draft selection is smaller than some, but well rounded. There's not a bad item in the menu. Be sure to try the sweet potato tots with sweet cinnamon  butter and the pretzels with beer sheet.   Also, let's talk brunch. Dive Bar has amazing brunch food, and I've always been able to be seated without a long eat (which is what a hungry person needs in the morning)."}
{"text":"Really nice bar area and super beer selection.  Food was really decent.  Macho Man Reuben was executed well - not overly heavy on the corned beef nor the cheese/kraut/slaw mixture.  Very nice flavor profile and not your typical heavy Reuben. I am not ashamed to say I ate the entire thing including the delicious sweet potato tots with that yummy cinnamon butter.  Three of us split a Southern Comfort Crazy Dilla that was really delicious.  The prices are reasonable and the service was good."}
{"text":"Came here after a night of brewery hopping. Great selection of beer and was very happy to see a lot of CO beer on tap to enjoy! Was in a sketchy part of town but we enjoyed the beer here!"}
{"text":"We order takeout from Dive on a weekly basis, and it never disappoints! Their wings are fantastic, and you have to try one of their \"I hate vegetables\" bowls. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Let's take every hipster clich√© and turn it into a bar! - said the owners of Dive.    Atmosphere:  they could've taken one bar stool away so people could have room to get up and down.  They wanted you trapped.  Pabst beer can lights that illuminate a list of $8 beers.  I'll let you figure out the irony in that.  Empty beer and wine bottle chandeliers.  Minimal wall art except a few staples from actual dive bars (antique ads, funny signs, etc) and some decent artwork.  Everything clashed.  It made no sense. 2 stars just because if they removed the tack it would actually be a very nice place.  Food:  bland nachos that were soggy by the time they got to us.  $16 Mac and Cheese.  How that can cost so much I am not sure.  Especially since they do not list which five cheeses they use.  It could be different powdered cheeses or variants of cheddar.  Who knows? 1 star for crazy prices and letting our nachos sit when the place was dead.  Service:  when we ordered after looking at the menu for a long while the bartender asked us \"that's it, nachos?  After all of that time looking at the menu?\" His pompous attitude set us back a bit.  At that moment we realized we recognized this bartender from another restaurant in town.  He gave us the exact same attitude because we wanted Jack Daniels in a whiskey bar.  Sometimes people just want to stick what they're comfortable with.  Terrible social skills.    A small group next to us they seemed to understand his and his brothers attitude (I think they were brothers.  I didn't feel like getting another snarky comment by asking) and shared it however they were the only ones out of the maybe 10 sitting at the bar. 1 star due to their better than thou attitude.  Cocktails:  dive bars do not serve martinis.  Repeat they do not.  However this did so we tried a couple.  The martinis were actually very good.  Pear martini and peach martini.  Delicious and the price was average for martinis so they get 5 stars there.  For a Saturday night this place was dead and it's easy to see why.  Why should consumers take the extra time to drive further away from town for martinis and expensive food when there are two actual dive bars within walking distance?  Plus there are a slew of other restaurants and bars closer to town that are full of much better food, service, and atmosphere.  Go somewhere else.  Unless you're just looking for a quiet place to drink where the bartenders like to put you down."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday evening.  A/C made the place comfortable.  Family all liked their entrees.  Friendly waitress and food came out quickly even with the place pretty full."}
{"text":"Had a really great time at Happy Hour yesterday! The half price \"tiny\" tostados were anything but tiny! The pork was tender and well seasoned. $3.50 smirnoff vodka drinks along with 2$ off drafts. The waitress was very nice, but very busy! She was running her butt off... word to the wise, get there before 5pm to get a seat! It gets packed in a hurry.  The pretzel sticks and zucchini fries were also great! I had the beer cheese with the pretzels. Although the name suggests it may be a hole in the wall, the interior is remodeled, and nice tables, bars, lighting, floors, etc.  Speaking of the floors... to put it as a yinzer... VERY SLIPPY! I almost fell, and had I had a few more cocktails, I may have been on the floor! Not sure why... maybe someone forgot to mop? Anyways, I'll be back I'm sure soon."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great and fresh. The beer selection is very nice.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great drink selection and very good food for a \"dive bar\". Super friendly staff and service."}
{"text":"I had to dislocate my jaw like a snake to get around the Reuben burger piled with corn beef and coleslaw with the 1000 island dressing and Swiss cheese.  Kinda two sandwiches in one served with potato options including sweet potater tots.  The tots come with a brown sugar butter so you can eat most the tots with ketchup as a side and eat the last two with sugar butter for dessert.    The service was good.  I ordered at the bar and chatted with the bartender.  They seem to have a pretty good balance for the block,  where it still pushes the bar for upper larryville without getting too upscale.  That is a nice way of saying \"divey, but not too too divey.\"  Hell, I'd give it still yet Another makeover if I were in charge.  The menu is great and has some exotique like chimichuri tacos but I think they should push even further."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that they treat french fries like a choose your own adventure.  You can build your own, mix and max and truly make a meal out of (of all things) French Fries.  I usually don't create my own anything burgers, nachos, guacamole, etc.  I have true faith in chefs that their combos will be better than anything that I can create. (And according to my brother, \"You are one pick away from disaster\" and I really stand by this).  I ordered the (premade) I Hate Vegetables Pittsburgh Bowl.  I was completely baffled by the amount of fried goodness that was presented before me.  Share this.  No really just share it.  The portions are filling and super shareable.  It reminds me of one of those meals that you want to just go to bed after because it is so filling.  We got wings, another mix and match adventure.  Super temperature hot and great flavors that come in dips or rubs.  And, of course, fried pickles.  They were fried goodness as well.    I really don't think that there is any other reason to come to Dive Bar if you are watching what you eat.  Save up your calories one day and treat yourself to a fried food adventure."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the fact that I was vulnerable, with a cold and skipping the Pitt game. Maybe it was because Dive had the Pitt game on when no one else did. Maybe it was the company, stellar as usual. Maybe it was the beautiful bar and great atmosphere. Maybe it was the Veggie Burrito that fed me for two days and the sweet potato tots with cinnamon butter that left me weak in the knees. Maybe it was the friendly wait staff that never let my creamy cup of delicious coffee hit the bottom. Maybe it was the pages of menu items each more delectable than the last. Or maybe it was everything at Dive. I can't WAIT to go back and try every damn thing on that super-robust menu.  Get thee to Dive, now!"}
{"text":"With brunching in the Burg on my mind, I stumbled upon this place.  The menu looked pretty vast including the beverage offerings.  I decided this would be a cool place to try.  Walking in it is definitely not a \"dive\" bar.  But sure cute name.  Nice and modern so I bellied up to the bar.    Started with an Irish coffee with a dash of Kailua.  Perfect warm me up drink on this cold Sunday afternoon.  Moving to the food, I opted for the eggs benedict, cali style.  This included fresh mozzarella, spinach, tomato, and avocado.  This came with a side of hash browns.  I, trying not to eat anything fried, asked for a substitute.  Unfortunately all substitutes were also fried.  I asked the bartender if they had fruit she said no, I said I was looking for a healthier option.  She said oh well you're not going to find that here.  Okay then, went with the hash and hardly touched it.  The eggs benedict was very scrumptious, I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Eggs were done perfectly runny and I loved the addition of the \"good\" fat avocado.    Before leaving I opted to try a Bloody Mary.  They make their own mix and you pick the vodka.  I went with Goose, no explanation needed.  I can say I was not a fan of this drink.  They use Sirachi, which is ok but was a little thick and other than that I didn't taste much else.  I should have stuck with the Irish coffee, especially at $10.00 a bloody.  Yikes, it definitely wasn't worth that even with the shot of Goose.    Solid choice for brunch, definitely try the eggs benedict since they have several options for every palate."}
{"text":"Went to dive around 10 pm on a Saturday night. It was half off apps and I got a chicken parm sandwich. The food was really good! Recommend the zucchini fries and pretzel sticks for an app!   I only deducted a star because the service was quite slow. I waited around 20 minutes for apps and another 20 for food.   Atmosphere was good. Pretty loud because it was a bar which was just what I expected! I would recommend this place for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Dive is exactly the sort of place Upper Lawrenceville was lacking before. It's a chilled out bar by night and a clean, fairly calm place to grab lunch or dinner during the day. Given the shortage of diners and weekend lunch places on this stretch of Butler Street, I was very glad when it opened.   I've been here for late Sunday lunch, dinner, and takeout multiple times. The service is always fast and very friendly, and the food never disappoints. The burgers are hand-formed with lots of toppings to choose from and reasonably priced for the size and quality. I've also had the fish & chips, which was quite delicious, and my boyfriend swears by their wings. Additionally the draft list is always surprisingly diverse and quite reasonably priced. I tried a Kentucky bourbon barrel aged ale on my last trip here. So good! I'll be back to Dive again soon I'm certain. It's a sure bet for a good meal in a relaxing environment."}
{"text":"After being back quite a few times more for takeout and twice to stay for food and/or drinks, I am disappointed to lower the review even further.  Really wanted to love this place because its so cute inside and so close to my house/the perfect spot for happy hour or a chill night out for drinks and dinner.  The service at Dive is seriously lacking and inconsistent. Between the grumpy, passive bartender and the waitress that completely neglected the table of my girlfriends and myself one Friday night -- I don't think I can even bring myself to come back and give this location another cent from my pocket.  Their grilled Caesar is absolutely delicious.  In fact - probably one of the best salads I've ever had and I get it for takeout at least once a week.  Two weeks ago I called to order my regular and their phones were down...Messages saying the line is no longer connected.  Last night, I finally got through and went to pick it up and for $14, I had one grilled heart of romaine with half its leaves missing and the takeout container about a third of the way filled with other vegetables.  The flavor was good, but carelessly prepared/seriously lacking and it was the final straw for me.  Luckily, I work not far from their location in Wexford so I'll try it there to get my fix.  Hopefully I wont run into the same annoying issues"}
{"text":"Second time here this time for brunch. I was really excited to try the chicken and funnel cake. I don't know what I was thinking. Of course the funnel cake was super greasy. The chicken was fried a little to hard for my liking, lacked flavor and was really bland. The home fries were flavorless as well and the salt n pepper I added didn't seem to make it better. I was really disappointed. My friends said their food was ok. I ate the chicken but literally had to take the breading off cause it was so crispy and add syrup to make it taste like something. So basically I had syrupy chicken. I would not go for brunch again. I would just order off their regular menu."}
{"text":"Ideal intimate event location for party of like 8-10 people. Menu has everything you could possibly want and all flavorful options. Serving size is generous. Potato tots are like dessert and so flipping' good. Had the thai wrap - A++ and the Thai burger (A+) ((needless to say I'm on a Thai kick))   Service is awesome. Both times went between 12-3 on the weekend, and the place wasn't busy at all so the atmosphere was quiet and somewhat intimate. At other times, I'm sure it gets busy and probably a bit loud, but, I suggest you go and find out for yourself!  I will definitely be back to this place - and often."}
{"text":"Walked down here on a Saturday night when Roundabout got a little too crowded. Our party was told there'd be a wait, but we were easily able to grab some drinks at the bar in the meantime.  We were seated after about 10 minutes (way earlier than expected), and our waitress was extremely nice. Good service, solid food and good drink selection. Exceptional Manhattans. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and the waitress was awesome! We went on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying it pains me to be writing this review.  We first visited Dive Bar about 2 years ago and it quickly became a regular stop for us.  However, over the past several months, it has really taken a turn for the worst.  The last 4 or 5 times we've been there we have been significantly underwhelmed by the food and the service.  And judging by the other reviews of their regular customers, it seems we aren't the only ones who have noticed an unwelcome change.  The wings, which used to be some of the best wings in Pittsburgh (IMHO), used to be large, crispy and delicious.  Lately, they are slimy and so small it makes one wonder if it's actually a chicken wing or the wing of a pigeon.  On my most recent order of wings, I requested them to be well done and crispy.  When I received them, they were just slimy, tiny wings that did not even look appetizing.  The sandwiches have all become dry and messy.  When I receive my sandwich and the contents are spewed across the plate, it ceases to be anything I'd like to have for dinner.    Lastly, the service used to be so wonderful.  The wait staff was always very attentive.  Now, even on slower days, it feels like you have to beg someone to refill your drink or check to see if you are enjoying your meal.  I'm quite sure they've become more busy, as Lawrenceville has developed and grown, however there is really no excuse for the poor quality of food and sub par service we've come to now expect.  It's a shame, really, but we'll be breaking up with you Dive Bar & Grill.  We used to love this place and visit here at least 2 - 3 times a month.  Unfortunately, we'll be removing it from our list of regular spots.  Best of luck to you in the future and I hope you change your ways.  Otherwise, I fear all your other regular customers will be breaking up with you as well."}
{"text":"Have been at Dive Bar twice now and have nothing but great things to say. You know how servers can make or break an experience? Well Clint (the owner) must've taken great care in the interviewing process. Make sure you ask for Jess or Mel when you go. They're at table-side every time you need them and show up the minute you are contemplating another drink or refill. Last time in I had the \"Hangover\" a whole big bunch of Pittsburgh awesomeness that makes your meal. Fries are to die for.  My wife had a grilled cheese that included multiple cheeses and \"Performance enhancing\" bacon! The atmosphere is friendly and fun, quiet enough for casual conversation, yet busy enough to feel the energy of a bustling dining and night-life experience. I would recommend Dive Bar to anyone from the area and visitors to the 'Burg' as well. Kudos, Clint!"}
{"text":"Always love a new brunch spot! This menu offers everything under the sun and believe me, my table tried just about everything! My favorite item I test tasted was the chorizo burrito. I will definitely be ordering that next time or building my own breakfast bowl. The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars is because, if you are offering a place for brunch an unlimited mimosa or Bloody Mary deal is a must!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great menu and wonderful staff. I love the mini sliders. It's a rest upscale take on a traditional dive bar. The bartenders are gracious and knowledgable about their menu and drink selection. One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Sometimes I wonder why some businesses that are mediocre at best succeed, and why those with good food and service fail.  When I think about my experience at Dive in Lawrenceville, I see a place that is mediocre at best in terms of the food, and well below standards as far as the service.  I see it succeeding because for and reason, people embrace a lot of these sub par places.  I am going to keep this short, but considering they were out of almost all of the red wines I tried to order, and considering they messed up our appetizer order and gave us the wrong food, there is no desire to go back.  Service was awful.  It shouldn't be hard to get water, the right good, etc.  We didn't order dinner after our sampling of apps because it was just that bad of an experience.    I had been to the Wexford location, and I don't remember it being this awful so I am hoping that this was just a fluke and that everyone else has better experiences."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of friends this past Saturday night and had a great experience. We had a bigger group but they were able to accommodate us right away.   Ordered the pretzel sticks with cinnamon butter, loaded croquettes and calamari and all were very good. The cocktails were also great. We happened to be there during the \"reverse happy hour\" from 9 - 11 pm so we got great deals on the apps and drinks.  Our server was very attentive and friendly and even gave each of us separate checks without us asking, which was unexpected since the place was busy.  Great food, service, and drinks!"}
{"text":"I think I might be slightly obsessed with this place. We were here twice in one week; once for dinner and then for brunch.   There menu is large and offers a nice variety. I always like a larger menu but I have a lot of family members who find it overwhelming.   My mom orders the nachos every time we go because she is obsessed with the beer cheese and  so am I! Yummy.   My husband usually sticks to sandwiches and has never had one he didn't like. The portions are generous which is always a plus. Recently my husband ordered the mahi mahi entree and loved it.   We just tried their brunch after hearing a friend rave about it (offered Saturday and Sunday's). Absolutely delicious. I was thinking about it the rest of the day and really wanted to go back on Sunday. Again- the selection is large. We started with donut holes- they are perfect with the chocolate sauce.   Two of us ordered the breakfast bowls. I did the build your own since I knew I wanted the beer cheese. The portion was large and even though I wanted to, I couldn't finish it.   I'm hoping to go back next weekend to try the funnel cake pancakes."}
{"text":"Largest food menu in Lawrenceville. Incredible signature drinks. Excellent atmosphere. This place just opened up but already my new favorite. This is just what upper Lawrenceville needed. Half off apps during happy hour ( mon-fri 5-7 and sat+sun 9-11). Can't wait to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Love this place...new in Pittsburgh. Found on Yelp....worth the visit love the appetizer"}
{"text":"Great menu and beer selection. I love the late night happy hour Sat/Sun specials -- 1/2 off apps! If you're looking for a heaping plate of goodness, I recommend the southern comfort sandwich, however, plan on taking a nap when you finish it!    I wish the vibe was a little less pretentious; it's not the most inviting atmosphere if you don't shop at Banana Republic. Other than that, it's a pretty sweet spot in the 10th ward."}
{"text":"Tried Dive around 11:30 on a Saturday morning for brunch after a rough night.  The Hangover sandwich put me right back on track for the day.  It was large and kinda greasy and exactly what my body needed after a pretty serious night out.  The coffee was tasty, as well."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and service has been good all the times we've been. Good happy hour menu with great prices for apps and drinks. Favorite item there so far has been the pierogie quesadilla with pretzel sticks and beer cheese as a close second. Some other items not as successful- chicken poppers, calamari (generic), spinach dip (lacking seasoning). Overall I think this is a great happy hour destination!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Dive Bar a handful of times and gotten take-out once, but there's always been something wrong with our experience every time. The first time my boyfriend and I tried the brunch here I ordered the Cali Eggs Benedict, which had almost no flavor. It's a fairly mild dish, but the hollandaise sauce should have given it some kind of flavor. My boyfriend got a standard burger, fries, and wings which were good. The food took a fair amount of time to come out.   The second time we had brunch here I tried the Smoked Gouda Omelet, which was good but very greasy. My boyfriend has his standard eggs and bacon, however he said it was terrible. The eggs were overdone, the toast had no butter on it, the bacon was cold. We also waited about 45 to an hour for our food.   The third time we dined here for dinner with a couple out of towners. They said their beer cheese that came with their pretzel app was cold, they also did not get the mustard they requested for it. My burger was over-done and all I could taste was the grill-meat on it, even though it had beer cheese and fried pickles. I got mac and cheese as the side, however it was really dry and not very cheesy. My boyfriend got wings which were ok this time. The food was also slow to come out this visit again.  We also got take-out once and I ordered the Loaded Pierogie Quesadilla. The quesadilla itself was good, however I expected it to come with sour cream on the side. There was no sour cream, which it was really missing, and so it was kind of dry to eat and was disappointing. Take-out was quick though."}
{"text":"We've eaten the there for mother's day, Easter Sunday brunch and many times in between...the could is as great as the atmosphere.  You have to try the pulled pork potato croquettes for the appetizer...yum!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! We ate here the first night we moved to the city and we have gone back at least 4 times in a few months. Every place gets compared to dive bar and nothing is as good. Their burgers are AMAZING!!! SWEET POTATO TOTS... Must get them. Great place to go when you are looking for a great sandwich. The \"hangover\" cocktail (not sure what it is actually called) is great!"}
{"text":"Best food you'll have at any bar, anywhere! This is the perfect bar for watching a game or getting a drink but then, boom, the food hits you by total surprise!! It borders on gourmet. Crazy good quesadillas, burgers, etc. but then also great risotto, Asian slaw, croquets.   There were some staffing issues in the past (it seemed like only ass holes worked here) but it seems to be better now.   Great draft list, nice pours, great music.   I wish they would turn the sound on for the games but that's it. I watched the Super Bowl here without sound but it wasn't the steelers, so I could get over it."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday with a friend for a lunch.  It was recommended to me by a coworker, so we decided to try it out, and we weren't disappointed!  We were one of only a few tables in there at the time, but the service was really great.. super attentive (but not annoying), and multiple staff members coming to our table to deliver food, clear plates, etc.. which i LOVE.  i love when youre made to feel important by not just your server, but the entire staff, and when you can tell there's a good team dynamic!  I really liked the menu.. there were plenty of options, but it wasn't overwhelming.  We ordered the hummus as an appetizer which came with pita bread and veggies.. love.  I ordered the thai chick wrap as my meal and it was really good.. i wouldn't say I was overly impressed, but I ate the entire thing and I'd probably recommend it to someone else.  The best part were my sweet potato tots that came as my side, and this heavenly sweet sauce that came with them for dipping.. SO. freaking. delicious.  The parking, from what I saw, was limited to street parking (which IS free there, so that was a plus!).  I didn't have any problems, but I can imagine that as it gets later in the day when people start coming in for happy hour or dinner that it can get a little tricky.  Over all, it was a good experience and I'll more than likely be back."}
{"text":"My first experience at Dive Bar & Grill was for brunch and boy am I sad that it took me this long to eat here!    Great menu options for brunch ranging from omelets, to breakfast burritos, breakfast sliders, savory and sweet potatoes, and just  yum.  I had a smoked Gouda omelet with bacon chopped deliciously inside and a side of sweet tater tots served with the most delicious cinnamon butter known to man.  It was delicious and the price was under $10.    I can't wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Best happy hour! We always go for half off apps and drink specials. I get the grilled portabello appetizer and the hummus plate. My boyfriend usually gets nachos and adds chicken or the loaded croquettes. Their drink specials are a deal too! The wraps, sandwiches and salads are my fav meals. For sides-asian slaw and sweet potato tots! The food comes out quick and the service is great. Our go to in lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"I dream of Dive bar! My boyfriend and I were pretty desperate for food after a bike ride one evening and stopped into Dive bar on a Saturday night. The place was packed and the service reasonably slow but the food was great! I had steak tacos with chimichurri and a side of their Mac n cheese! I really didn't care about the macaroni and should have probably gotten something lighter but the steak tacos completely satiated my need for red meat and delicious chimichurri. While I do prefer chimichurri to be a little thicker, it was very flavorful and the steak was not over cooked. My boyfriend had the pierogie quesadilla and really enjoyed it as well. The menu has such a wide array of treats from burgers to pasta to chimichangas. Maybe I need to have my bike rides end in Lawrenceville more often!"}
{"text":"I moved to the Burg about 2 months ago and have already been to dive 4 or 5 times. It's my fianc√©e and i's favorite Sunday night dinner spot. Plenty of classic gastropub type options as well as some lighter options for the lady. I get the Burger Bowl every time and it's the bomb. Ground up burger patty, cheese and fixins served over your choice of chips or fries. I add an over easy egg for extra runny, sloppy goodness. Pretty solid beer rotation also."}
{"text":"Really tasty food. Lots of menu choices, fair pricing and interesting cocktails. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Dive was on burger night-which is an excellent deal.My boyfriend was convinced by our server-who was excellent-to order the PB 'N Chutney burger. It sounds gross but it was amazing!We have also had the Reuben eggrolls and the Loaded Croquettes-both of which were large enough to be individual meals. Other favorite dishes include:buffalo chicken egg rolls,the Kahlua pork sliders, and the sweet potato tots (excellent with the cinnamon sugar butterI liked that the egg rolls had a chipotle coating, the flavors blended nicely-like buffalo chicken dip wrapped in an egg roll. The portion size was 3 large egg rolls and I was fine letting my food-deprived friend eat 2. Only suggestion: they served it with ranch and I think blue cheese would have been a better accompaniment. The kahlua sliders were very tasty! We assumed there would be three sliders but there were 4 so I thought that was a good deal for $8. I do not like onion straws so I did eat these minus that ingredient. The pineapple and red pepper chutney was out of this world!it complimented the sweet BBQ sauce well and the pork was deliciously tender. Now the sweet potato fries are an option as a side with any burger (except the sliders), sandwich, or wrap. The cinnamon sugar butter is reason enough to order these. The tots are nothing spectacular but that butter well makes up for that. Also they had some great beers on tap last night, both my friend and I enjoyed Clown Shoes Clementine (corriander and clementine was the flavor profile) which was new to us and Bell's Oberon (an oldy but goody). All in all the beers (6 of them) were the most expensive part of the meal and totaled $30. For $50 this was great food, great beer, and a good time out!) Everything is very reasonably priced, they have a varied menu so that everyone should be able to find something appetizing."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick snack but ended up eating a huge meal.  Nachos were on point and the buffalo chicken wrap had amazing flavor.  Service was quick, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Will most definitely be back next time we visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The pulled pork nachos are a sloppy mess of deliciousness. Wings and burgers are just a notch above every other wing and burger joint. A great place to order takeout from on game day!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok.  First it was not really what I expected, since it's not actually a \"dive bar\" as the name implies, but I guess some sort of hipster ironic version of a dive bar that actually serves some fancy drink and food selections (but also some casual comfort food as well).  The menu was actually quite overwhelming and all over the place in the options provides, from these \"bowls\" that consisted of fries with various meats and cheeses and other things on top of them, to ahi tuna sliders, to risotto, to fried pickles.  I couldn't detect any sort of common theme to it, as the options included anything from American, southern, Italian, Asian, Mexican, etc.  I ordered the gouda risotto with hangar steak (or maybe it was a flank steak). The risotto was actually quite well done and tasty.  However, the steak that came with it was a huge disappointment.  They asked me how I wanted it cooked and I asked for medium rare, but it was medium well in the center and beyond well done on the edges, with some black charring on the ends.  It was quite chewy and flavorless and difficult to eat.  If this were a fancier place I would've sent it back, but I felt strange doing that in a place called \"Dive Bar\" and the server, while prompt and attentive, never actually asked how our food was.  We also had the fried pickles app which was tasty.  Some of my friends had the sweet potato tots which were really interesting and tasty.  They have a number of interesting cocktails on their cocktail menu, as well as a selection of wines and beers.  I ordered a cocktail called \"The Aristocrat\" but it ended up being too sweet and limey for my taste, though it was ok.  I really liked the ambiance here, included the background music (including selections such as the theme song from Requiem for a Dream), the artwork, candle chandeliers, and panel of digital flames on the wall, and nice wooden tables, though the giant TV screen with football on it was in rather stark contrast."}
{"text":"A local friend decided to take us to one of his favorite places. So we excepted and ended up being very delighted.  I ended up having some Salmon and my friend had the Meatloaf. Both were very, very good. I liked my Salmon but to be honest, his dish was better. We both had desert, mine was a cobbler and his was a chocolate creation that was almost as good as my cobbler. What topped off my meal was the beer selection which was so good I had a hard time deciding. Ask for the fries extra crispy and get mayo on the side if you want to eat your frittes properly."}
{"text":"First, I will be back. Second, judging from the size of the menu, I may have to visit several times.  I heard good things about this place through the Yelp vine. I was happy to hear a friend picked this place for a get together. Dive isn't exactly accurate at all. The place seems to be split into a bar half and dining half, both nice places. There's no alcohol allowed in the dining area. I didn't walk around and explore so the description is more of an educated guess. Ohh, and I was kidding about the no alcohol in the dining area, that'd be ridiculous! (Hopefully you continued reading to this point).  Anyways, I asked our waitress what her favorites were, per my custom. She mentioned The Professor, which sounded awesome, but I try not to duplicate orders if I can (friend's choice). I honestly had a difficult choice ahead because the menu was relatively enormous. My eyes caught prosciutto and bacon in the same row and I knew my decision had been made. I ordered The Hangover. (Really big sandwich, possibly the first I've ever cut in half before picking up). I got a side of sweet potato tots, over fries, or some other terrible choice. I have never regretted sweet potato anything. These were no different. It came with some sorta cinnamon butter, which was totally unnecessary in my opinion. The tots held their own.  I'm looking forward to coming back and trying something different soon. Maybe scheduled around happy hour this time."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Dive Bar & Grill during the \"Lawrenceville Blossom Tour.\" The happy hour sounded promising: 5 pm to 7 pm with half price apps except those containing seafood, $2 off drafts, $3.50 standard vodka mixes and $4 wines.  First of all, the appetizer portions were huge! Unfortunately, the food itself was nothing special. I was psyched about the sliders being included in the happy hour special but then they were served on generic grocery store type buns...disappointing. I also ordered the hummus and tiny pork tostadas which were  adequate. However, I can't complain too much given the happy hour price - 3 large appetizers for around $15, which the two of us couldn't finish.   The atmosphere was great and you could easily carry out a conversation. Service was great with the exception of the \"kids burger\" that was accidentally added to our bill. It was quickly rectified and apologies were made.  All things considered, it was a great deal for happy hour but I won't be going back to pay full price for the food."}
{"text":"Food poisoning - went here for dinner 4/13/2014 had great atmosphere and modern style. Plus some higher end drink selections...but everything good I had to say was short lived. That night the fun began - violent food poisoning from the thai peanut chicken wrap.   I was to fly to Colorado at 4:00pm today but had to reschedule my flight , take an extra day off work and pay increased parking fees totaling $ 526 - this place needs to be more accountable to there patrons. Obviously improper storage of food or handling.  Eat here at your own risk !"}
{"text":"I had been to the Dive Bar & Grill on the Southside on Carson street and had a good experience.  So when I saw this location I thought it would be a great place to have dinner.  My son and I went in and took a seat in the dining area.  I wasn't very hungry so I just wanted something on the smaller side.  I saw that they had the Rueben Balls in the appetizer section.  I had eaten them before at the Southside location  and really liked them so I decided I would order them.  When the dish came it was nothing like the dish I had previously.  Instead of being crispy little balls similar to hush puppies, they looked like egg rolls.  The dough they were wrapped in was very heavy/clunky.   There was barely any meat in them.  There definitely wasn't any sauerkraut in them, but there was a very tiny amount of cheese.  It was extremely disappointing.  I definitely wouldn't order them again.  In fact I was given three and left one and a half.  The dipping sauce was good but the thick dough overpowered everything else."}
{"text":"Found this place on our way to light up night. Food was good. Table maintenance could be better. Busy and bustling. Good find. We had burger (but dry per my husband), Cobb salad (good), fried zucchini was fresh and good. Hamburger soup a bit like paste."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, this place is way too nice to be a true dive.   They serve brunch on Saturday and Sunday until 3, which was a nice surprise when I visited around 2 on a Saturday. Given the time, my husband and I were able to choose whether we wanted to order off the brunch menu or lunch/dinner menu. There were SO many options that I just decided to go all in with brunch and not even consider the other menu for fear of complete brain meltdown.  I ordered the chicken and funnel cake. You read that right FUNNEL CAKE. My meal was really good-- the chicken was perfect and the funnel cake was all funnel cakey goodness. It was a nice little variation, though I do prefer waffles with my breakfast chicken.  Fighting Elleck from Arsenal Cider was on tap. Since that's one of my favorite ciders, I have absolutely no complaints for the drink department. There was a pretty extensive drink menu for those who want to get a little more fancy/wild.  Our server was lovely and we had a lovely time. I'll definitely be back to try the lunch/dinner menu."}
{"text":"To me Dive was like buying generic Cocoa Puffs versus name brand; it tastes almost exactly the same, but there is something just a little off. You really can't put your finger on it but there is the slightest difference. Well, that's how DIVE was to me. It was just left of great. The service was great; our waitress rocked, and the atmosphere is good, although it is a small place, but there was something about the food....It was good, very good in fact, but there was something that held it back from being great.   We started with zucchini fries and chicken poppers. They were good; the poppers came with a variety of sauces and, to me, were one of the best things we had. I was not such a fan of the zucchini fries. The coating was weird, although it may have been the oil. I got the AM burger with fries, and I thought it was very good. Cooked well with a good flavor, although I could have done without the onion straws. The fries are hand cut- always the best- and pretty good, but there was something weird...I don't know what, but once again, I think it may have been the oil. They were just a little left of awesome.   The BF got the knuckle sandwich which I really enjoyed. It doesn't really say in the description but it's actually grilled, like a grilled cheese, which I loved. He got the fried brussell sprouts, which we did not like but the rest of our party did. One person got the shrimp po'boy with optional crab cake and it was HUGE. He loved it and I will say it looked delicious! And to add the crab cake for $2 is amazing. You get the shrimp and crab cake for just 2 bucks more!!  Actually, I thought the prices were pretty fair for everything. Comparable or a little less expensive than any other new-ish trendy bar/restaurant. The prices for a burger or sandwich is about what you'd pay at most places, and the portion sizes are really large. All in all, there are a few things I'd like to try, but nothing that I had was like so abfab that I have to go back for."}
{"text":"Left Dive Bar less than 24 hours ago and wanna go back soon!  Four of us went in hungry and came out HAPPY!  We started with two apps:  Loaded Pierogie Crazy-Dilla which was superb - perfect shared by four, but could certainly be a meal for one.  Loaded Croquettes also tasty (and beautiful) stacked high with their pulled pork crown.  Note:  we asked for 4 - the order is for 3... 'Cause no one was willing to share!  And yes, clearly we enjoy potatoes in a variety of presentations.  From there, we were all over the menu:  Hubs went for the Dive Loco Moco, a tower of potato, meat, cheese and topped with an egg.  Friend 1 had the Smoked Gouda Risotto and loved it - big grilled skirt steak right in the middle, done perfectly to order.  Friend 2 went for the Black and Blue Burger and fries and I had the Castro with a side of Asian Slaw - so fab!  We all agreed that there were many, many items that needed our immediate attention and are looking forward to making that happen this food season."}
{"text":"So, we have been to Dive a handful of times and always had solid food. They usually have a decent tap list and the appetizers and small plates are reasonably priced and tasty.   Our most recent visit we tried the bacon wrapped dates, Mahi Mahi tacos, and Flank steak with risotto. Now, I have certain expectations when it comes to fish tacos. They specified that is comes with \"Asian slaw and Chipotle cream sauce\". Well, the slaw was flavorless and wilted, no crunch at all, and just sad. The cream sauce was also bland, and instead of a slight drizzle it was a huge smear... I will say that the Mahi was a nice portion and seemed to be good quality. But totally ruined by the slaw and sauce. Husband's steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly, but the risotto was pretty bland and undercooked. Bacon wrapped dates were okay, but they came with this weird pineapple salsa that had an odd vinegar flavor and they were covered in a BBQ sauce that was overpowering.   Service was disappointing also. They weren't overly busy, but once the food runner dropped off our entr√©es we didn't see our server again (so no chance of getting a second beer...) and pretty much had to chase her down to get the check.   All in all, I would stick to the basics on the menu. The name says it all, Dive bar, stick to bar food."}
{"text":"We did brunch here yesterday morning. I wasn't sure what to expect and was surprised to see the interior is very nice and they have a lot of restaurant style seating. We chose Dive Bar & Grill after seeing their extensive menu online. They really have anything you'd ever want in the bar food category. Even for brunch, we were overwhelmed with the options.  We all shared the donut holes as an appetizer and I ordered the Morning Cheese Steak, which was a regular cheese steak with beer cheese, sauce, toppings, and an egg on top. You had your choice of side and I went with the sweet potato tots. I thought it was really good. A little hard to eat... it was sloppy due to the beer cheese. Other members of my party ordered the South of The Border Omelet, a Steak and Fry Bowl, and a regular cheese-steak. All the food looked amazing and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves!   We didn't drink, but they had a large draft and cocktail menu. They seemed fair priced and I'd love to come back for lunch. I love that there is such a large variety of items."}
{"text":"OK so I live really close and its a mission of mine to visit every restaurant on Butler. I started with this restaurant and I was happy that I did. I ordered the wings and the Professor Sandwich. Lets start with the wings. I ordered them naked with the thai chili sauce on the side. They were perfectly cooked and the sauce was amazing. Next was the Professor, A breaded chicken sandwich with Canadian bacon and thousand island dressing. Super Satisfying with good flavors. The server was really awesome and always had my iced tea filled. Better yet when I got the bill I saw that the wings were half-off because they do this awesome happy hour all week. I think 5-7 all their apps are half off. That was just the icing on the cake for me. Don't be put off by some of the more negative reviews because this place is really solid and is worth a try"}
{"text":"Okay, so I had never heard of Dive Bar and Grill in Lawrenceville.  Since I had never heard of the place, I had no expectations about the d√©cor, food, drinks, etc...  This past Friday, after a visit to the Home Show, my daughter Muff, my sister and my friend Stephanie had a chance to stop by the restaurant.  We were on our way to another restaurant when my sister decided that we should visit Dive bar and Grill, even though we had already passed the place.  I had to turn around several blocks later to go to Dive after my sister had an epiphany. (%^*$!)  Anywho, I turned back around and found parking next to the restaurant.  We walked right in and were able to find seating immediately.  Apparently, it's a seat yourself type of place and our waitress said that we just missed a crowd.  Whew!  We were starving and were not willing to wait to eat anywhere.  (Somewhat stupid, because it was a Friday night after 9:00 during prime business hours.)   The d√©cor is intimate and cozy.  Exposed brick, chandeliers made out of reclaimed wine bottles and booths.  Very important to me, modern and clean bathroom.  Definitely an upgraded dive bar!   My sister ordered an appetizer to share with the table which was what looked like a fried large wonton skin with pulled pork, salsa, chopped scallions and cheese on top.  It was pretty tasty.  Our waitress advised us that the food portions were rather large, but we were like, \"Yeah, they all say that!\". I ordered the Salmon BLT ANDTHENSOME sandwich wrap, my sister ordered Alabama Slammer burger, my friend ordered the Macho Man Reuben sandwich and Muff ordered the Hometown salad bowl.  With our sandwiches and wrap, we also received homemade potato chips and fresh-cut fries.  Let me tell you something, that Salmon BLT ANDTHENSOME sandwich wrap was scrumptious.  The salmon had a Thai chile glaze.  Mmmmm good!  The Macho Man Reuben sandwich was hu-ru-gi-lous (I know it's not a word!) and the meat was nice and lean. (I traded half of my wrap for a third of the reuben.)  My sister said the Alabama Slammer burger with a brown sugar spice rub, bacon, cheese and onion straws was delicious. (She could only stuff herself with half and had to take home the rest.)  My daughter Muff couldn't finish her Hometown salad bowl either, but said that it was good too.  What a delightful surprise and a nice funky joint that we will return to in the future.  I wish that I had a spot like this closer to my home.  Boo-hoo!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times.  Too heavy on the fried stuff for me but others will like it.  Dive bar it is not but like the branding.  Easy to access and good parking."}
{"text":"Sadly i could only give this particular experience three stars. I've been here countless times and have never had any issues. Our server was good and I would never blame a waiter for an incorrect order, but..my order came out wrong.   I normally don't mind an error on my order but there was only one other party in the restaurant and they already had their orders. Not to mention I ordered a standard menu item. A veggie omelette somewhere came out with bacon in it. I'm not a vegetarian but I immediately thought about how problematic this could've been if I was.   Our server was great again like I said, and she promptly corrected my order. Food was good and I wish I could've left a better review, but I had to be honest and I hope that my experience can better help the business and future diners."}
{"text":"I met one of my friends (who had been to the Dive Bar a few times) for dinner one evening after work.  We were able to quickly and easily find seats, although I'm sure when it's really busy, it can be frustrating!  We ordered the Tuscan Spinach & Artichoke Dip appetizer which was fantastic!  Well, it was great - but needed a little extra salt or seasoning, but still great!    The menu is pretty decent sized and we had a hard time deciding what to eat, but both went with Quesadillas (Crazy-dillas!) and had decided to share.    My friend got the Loaded Pierogie and I got the Southern Comfort.  We both agreed that the loaded pierogie was - Ok.  Nothing to write home about.  It was actually pretty bland.  But, we both devoured the Southern Comfort Quesadilla!  It was phenominal.  I will definately order this again!    Check it out, give it a chance!  It's a great place with a great beer selection!"}
{"text":"After frequent visits to multiple locations I can confidently give this place 5 stars. It is always consistent and their food and drinks are all awesome. They also have a huge menu and even funnel cakes for brunch! I especially love the lawrenceville location as it is close to my house and has my favorite bartender, Rich. Def always a good time and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I went here for lunch and day drinks after a trip to Metamorphosis spa. It is definitely not what you're thinking! Clever name, regular bar haha.   We weren't sure if it was seat yourself or not when we walked in so we helped ourselves to pushing the two front tables together, there were 5 of us. There was a nice mix of patrons, a family eating in the dining area and a half full bar of friends and couples.   I ordered the Detox Retox, hoping it was similar to the Happy Ending at the Shiloh in Mt. Washington. And it was good! A little too much gin for my taste but refreshing nonetheless. I also ordered the Monkey Tripel and Purple Haze. They had a great craft beer and cocktail selection.  Okay, for the noms. Wow... impressive menu, made it difficult for us to chose! I went with the \"I Hate Vegetables\" create your own bowl... chicken, mac & cheese, sweet potato tots, smoked gouda, and buffalo sauce. Holy indulgence! It ended up costing $14 bucks for all of my add ins but it was WELL worth it. Who doesn't love a bowl of random deliciousness? Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals as well.   Our first server was very attentive and personable. We left for about 5 minutes and then a change of plans occurred so we walked back in. Our table was still empty so we went back to it but our new server was not personable... she was awkward almost.   All in all, my girlfriends and I enjoyed our drinks, food, and conversation. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try something new so we browsed yelp until finally settling on Dive Bar & Grill. They did not disappoint.   We went for lunch on a slow Thursday afternoon. We got the zucchini fries, and spinach dip for our appetizers. I got The Professor (chicken sandwich) and my husband got the salmon BLT ANDTHENSOME. My mother in law got the Mediterranean wrap with sweet potato tots. Everything tasted amazing and came out quickly. Our server was friendly and very attentive.   If you are looking for a laid back place for lunch/dinner with good drinks and a big menu, look no further! We definitely want to go back already!"}
{"text":"If you're uppity, don't let the name discourage you! This is one of those places where you kind of have to become a regular if you live close enough.   I came here with a couple of buddies one night just to get some food and a drink and hang out. It turned out to be the perfect spot, given our tastes in venues and what we each had in mind. You walk in and it's open seating. The bar space is great; you have a couple TVs in case you want to watch sports, there's a big blackboard with all the draft beers (which rotate every so often) and the bartenders/waiters are all personable and helpful.   Prices are reasonable, and portions are huge! Maybe too much...but who's complaining? I ordered a Reuben, which I don't regret the slightest bit. My friends got sandwiches too. We all have appetites. We all barely finished. Couldn't have asked for a better spot. I actually can't wait for an excuse to be back and try some of the menu items that I heard were really good."}
{"text":"The name is meant to be ironic, since this is quite a polished establishment. My husband and I stopped in for some drinks and sat at the bar, which was low key. Bar tender was very nice, I'd go back to eat the menu looks interested, especially the sweet potato tots!"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good and I appreciate a place that actually has a Mafalda. Overall pretty good but not that memorable in my opinion"}
{"text":"We started (or tried to start) with some happy hour nachos. I ordered the fajita quesadilla and my fiance got the southern comfort. Both were good, but nothing to write home about. Our appetizer didn't arrive until after our quesadillas as the waitress realized she hadn't brought them to us until she delivered our food. Those things happen sometimes so we were understanding. I will give this place another chance because the service was good, the food was okay, and the atmosphere was good. You also can't beat 1/2 price apps and drafts for their happy hour!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and it has always been about average food. I've had an assortment of things on the menu. This past visit, we had an assortment of appetizers and drinks. We had the Irish nachos, cheesesteak sliders, garlic Parmesan wings, zucchini fries, calamari, and pretzel sticks (yes, I know a lot, but it takes was a lot of people). The Irish nachos were the best, they just need to chop the corned beef more to disperse across the nachos. The cheesesteaks, zucchini fries, and calamari were all put in similar batter and were pretty bland. Everything needed seasoning. The pretzel sticks were good, but the beer cheese was disappointing, and it wasn't mixed very thoroughly, with displeasing white chunks in it. Lastly, the garlic Parmesan wings were crispy, but had no flavor at all. There was cheese on them, but seriously no sauce. All in all, the food was average. However, I think the atmosphere is good for casual drinks, especially for their happy hour specials. They also did have good service, which should always be commended. But, in my opinion, this seems to be just another average spot to me."}
{"text":"Okay, first the food is amazing. As a guy from Washington, DC. That is saying A Lot! Second, the service is so F ing horrible it is the reason for the 2. I wish there was another reason. Don't come here for hospitality, cause it does not exist! Third, atmosphere is quality, cute little bar. But that is all."}
{"text":"I was admittedly apprehensive because it's called Dive Bar and is in Lawrenceville, so I assumed it would be full of insufferable hipsters and have fourteen dollar \"libation\" cocktails. Boy was I wrong. The food is great, reasonably priced but the specials make it straight up cheap (half off food on Sunday nights? that's nuts, love it). Solid beer selection as well. The restaurant side is comfortable and they have TVs positioned well. So far have tried the mac and cheese (delicious, not too rich and not too garlicky), the fish and chips entree (the fish isn't too heavily battered like a lot of places and actually has flavor to it, the fries are great) and the Castro sandwich (their version of the cuban, the pickle spears are a nice touch, super tasty). Service has been good, and we will definitely be back. Bonus that it's in Upper Lawrenceville so it's quieter and much easier to find parking than below the cemetery on Butler, seems like some of the people from that side must be afraid to go that far up the street, their loss."}
{"text":"Another Larryville joint that can get super crowded. However, there's a reason for that...the food! I've had a few things but love the pretzels and steak tacos. When it's busy and seems to take awhile for service its's ok because the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Wow!! What delicious burgers !! And interesting combinations that really work all for a very reasonable price! Camburger was incredible and the sweet potato tater tots were excellent! Really good service also for a busy Saturday night! Can't wait to go back! Very impressive selection of many things !!!"}
{"text":"Went to Dive Friday night with 5 others and was once again pleased with the service and food. We were seated immediately on the bar side in the back of the restaurant. The waitress was pleasant and attentive. What I like about Dive is it is a team effort. The bartender and other waitresses helped out with the table. We ordered chicken nachos to start and I had the Shrimp Po Boy. It is an excellent sandwich. My brother commented that it's his all time favorite sandwich.  I highly recommend Dive for happy hour, brunch, or just to watch a game."}
{"text":"Not from the area, asked a couple of ladies at a job site, they advised to come here. I was not disappointed, had the porky VS the hamburger, excellent pulled pork, on top of a massive burger. Definitely a great place to get your eat on."}
{"text":"Huge. And I'm not just talking about just portion sizes. The menu at Dive is enormous and full of options. You would think with that large of a menu, some of the items would be a miss, but I've tried items in almost all categories (quite a feat!) and they are all hits!  My favs include the grilled romaine Caesar salad and the bowls; fries or chips topped with different veggies, meat, and cheeses. And the brunch menu adds even MORE options for you to choose from, including a mini funnel cake for 3 bucks that is the perfect size to share.  Dive has a plentiful draft and cocktail list. Be warned, Dive has a small dining room and some slightly surly wait staff. The value and variety here always keeps me coming back, though!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch the other day. As you walk into the bar there is a wall that separates the bar from the restaurant seating area. The bar is really long. We sat ourselves at a table for two in the resturant area. There are high tables and low tables. We were greeted quickly with a pleasant server. Ordered a Castro sandwich and a Dive bar Elite burger. The burger or should I say burgers were cooked as ordered and very juicy. I had to cut up one burger as no way I could manage two huge burgers, bacon, lettuce and tomato on the bun. Bacon was crispy. The fries were hand cut and delicious. Two fried dill spears were also on the plate which were not my favorites. I just don't like any form of pickle. My guess had a Castro.  I'm assuming called a Castro as my guest mention that it was not really a Cuban sandwich. My guest said the sandwich was good but needs improvement. The chips served were very good. The place is clean. I read about the slow service but we encounterd nothing but great fast service. We were their around 11:30 am on Saturday. As we were eating, a steady stream of customers entered the restaurant. Street parking in that area is free. There is a lot adjacent to the bar but its only for bank customers. We would visit again. Dropped one star due to the Castro."}
{"text":"Not always the best service but consistently good food....Mac and cheese and BBQ is great"}
