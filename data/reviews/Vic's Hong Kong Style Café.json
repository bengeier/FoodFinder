{"text":"We tried to leave after they brought out the ???? and it was actually just deep fried chicken balls with sweet and sour sauce but felt too rude. We sent back that dish and regretted sticking around for the rest. We also ordered ????? ???? and ?????? It was all gross -- super oily and bland other than the added MSG. We tasted it, paid, and left. Certainly won't make that mistake again. If you want decent Chinese food in Calgary, do yourself a favour and try TianJin on 16th ave."}
{"text":"I always appreciate a place with good and thoughtful service. And this place was one of them! Came here for a quick take away last night and was pleasantly surprised despite the short exchange. The half a roasted duck that we ordered was tasty and indeed good for two. Portion sizes seem decent for its prices. Very HK 'cha chan teng' feel. Likely a place we'll come back."}
{"text":"Super good hk style bbq!Even better than samwoo in Los Angeles! There is breakfast menu till 11am,there is Chinese donut come with congee!yummm"}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ pork on rice. It was some of the worst I have ever had. Like a 2 out of 10 Also bad price and small portion. Anyway look elsewhere if you want quality Chinese BBQ because this is not the place. A friend I was with ordered congee and a Chinese donut. The donut was over cooked and flacked apart and was way to oily. The congee was average at best."}
{"text":"Terrible Chinese food ... get a new cook"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant, I've gone here for 15 years, usually for their soy sauce chicken in noodle soup.  I've noticed in the past year that their portions have gotten smaller.  For example, if you order a chicken thigh with noodles (\"yow gie BAY\" in Chinese), they don't give you the full thigh even if you're willing to pay the dollar more for it. Or if you order a combo such as peking duck & soy sauce chicken in soup, they give you much less of both meats.  On the plus side, the ladies that have worked here for years are very nice. This used to be known as Happy Valley."}
{"text":"I would give them a four and a half star for the BBQ items,  but three stars at the most for other dishes.  I find their regular dishes to be quite americanized,  very plain, lacking the real hongkongese flavor which is what I would prefer from a hongkongwse cafe."}
{"text":"Came here for some HK style food and was craving for some Chinese BBQ but they were sold out by 8pm. Probably a good sign. I ordered a bowl of HK style wonton noodle soup with beef brisket and a glass of iced lemon tea. Both were good and reminded me of Hong Kong. Worth a try if you like noodle soup."}
{"text":"Short review and only for quality of the HK hot milk tea. We came here on NYE in search of a HK hot milk tea comparable to the one at T&T Supermarkets in Toronto (my home town). There is something about how \"luung\" (deepness in flavor) of the HK milk tea at the T&T that I really enjoy (see review of the HK milk tea in my T&T review). The minute I saw the tin kettle with the nettled leaf catcher inside, broiling on the portable hot plate, I knew this place was going to be legit. I got my usual order, HK milk tea without sugar. He put a heavy hand of evaporated milk at the bottom of the cup, and then filled the rest of the paper cup with the dark tea. It was reunited love at first sip. $3 is a hefty price compared the the one at T&T supermarket, but in a small town like Calgary on a super cold day, it was worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be called \"Happy Valley\" and I was a regular for 20 years whenever I went to Calgary, and I was in Calgary a lot. \"Happy Valley\" was a 4 stars out of 5 and the price was reasonable.

Then several years ago someone bought it and changed the name to Vic's. Prices increased, food quality went down. Some dishes were plainy aweful. I wouldn't reject the quality on only one try. After many visit I have a conclusion. I am not kidding, I can cook better. Now it is 2 stars. I will not go there again."}
{"text":"The food and services are terrible here. First when my friend ordered the lunch special, including the free soup and a drink of your choice, but they never brought them to him without us asking them a couple of times. Secondly, when I chose the items for my lunch combo, the waitress failed to inform me the extra charge on the items I chose. I only realized that when they brought over the bill. The waitress never came to ask us about our food or add tea for us the entire time. The food portion is very small and the quality is mediocre. I could easily get the same food twice the size at much less cost and better quality somewhere else. Anyway, would not recommend any of my friends for this one due to the reasons above. If you like Hong Kong style Cafe, where are quite few other better options available nearby this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food can range from good to delicious, from generous to smaller portions, depending on who's cooking. I've eaten most of the menu and here is what I recommend.

BBQ meats and rice. Not the best bbq or biggest portions, but the meats are flavourful and I like the rice (dry not mushy).

Pan Fried Beef Rice Noodles. Big portion, nice wok taste to the noodles. Lots of meat.

Any of daily specials. Includes a drink and free soup. Get the Chinese broth version, its healthier and clean tasting.

Service is fast and friendly, and you can get in and out within an hour. Always busy at lunch but turnover is quick, so you'll usually get a seat with minimal wait."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my big sis and we love there wonton BBQ pork noodle soup. One of the best in Calgary. The BBQ pork cut fresh and the soup so flavourful. There HK style coffee is amazing a must try. They have specials everyday and good selection of rice, noodles and specialty dishes. Average price for a dish is under $15."}
{"text":"It's a good place to eat the roasted( BBQ pork, or chicken....)  it includes variety choices with rice, noodles or something, it's obviously a good Hong Kong style restaurant, the worse thing may be, there's lots of MSG in the soup of the noodles. That was the time I perform in downtown, then I came here. After I ate, I feel too thirsty to sing."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese restaurant on a busy street in Chinatown. It's on the 2nd floor and they have tables with large windows.
Limited English is spoken here but he menus are in English as well as Chinese and food is a universal language.
I had the lunch special which was available to 3 pm I think. The roasted duck is really good here which is what I had as well as Mao Poe Tofu. Both came with white rice and a house soup. Very filling and very good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good place. Not many places in Calgary to get HK style cafe food. The BBQ pork and roast duck is of reasonable quality. Recommended for those looking for the type of food this place serves - HK style breakfast, cafe food and BBQ pork dinner."}
{"text":"I'm pretty weary of Hong Kong style cafes in Calgary because in my experience they have always been mediocre but Vic's is pretty good!  I usually order chicken stirfry with wide rice noodles and bok choy and it is good and consistent every time.

My mom ordered hainan chicken once after seeing a photo of it on the wall and it looked nothing like the photo in the worst way possible. It also tasted nothing like hainan chicken and the rice that accompanied the chicken was not the hainan style rice. I would not recommmend this dish here."}
{"text":"We came here because my partner was really craving HK style milk tea and this was the most recommended place for it in Calgary. We were still a bit early for another appointment so we decided we'd stop by here and sit, maybe get a something to munch on for 45 minutes. Best and worst mistake ever.

Best because their HK style milk tea is actually pretty good and we were quite satisfied with it (It hit the spot, my partner said). Worst because we ordered salt and pepper chicken wings, and it took 30 minutes to come out (we had already finished our milk tea at this point, and borderline late for leaving to go to our appointment). We expected the rudeness, but we really hoped for a more expedient service in an Asian restaurant... especially when barely a handful of tables were occupied.

When we did get the wings, we had to take them to-go. They were quite greasy, and when I think about it - not very good value-for-money (there were maybe 7 or 8 pieces for $12). Next time, we'll only come back for the HK style milk tea, and we'll be taking it to go."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try something different than my usual go-to HK style restaurant and convinced my party to come here. Ummmm....the prices are really good!! The curry chicken was actually not bad. The iced tea is strong enough for my liking. What failed miserably for me was the Hainanese chicken!!!  The oil rice smelled like feet and the drum stick was tasteless. I probably wouldn't return. It just wasn't worth it for me to experience what I did in that chicken dish."}
{"text":"Service is ok. But I find their food a bit bland. So I ordered the chicken mushroom congee with almond milk drink. They don't have a combo price. Portion is pretty small in terms of the congee. I know what you are thinking.. congee is tasteless right??? Well I have had better congee in before. Chicken mushroom congee is actually one of my favorite congee. But the texture of the congee is a bit watery. Not fluffy rice texture if you know what I mean. 

The almond milk was too diluted. For $3.75 maybe add more almond powder and less ice. Also I think this place is a bit overpriced. 

I think this place will be a one time place. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Better than what I expected! Good price and Not bad food.

Usually the steam rice gives me a strong impression in a general sense of a restaurant. The rice here is okay, not mushy at all. 

I ordered the Roast pork and BBQ pork on rice ($10.95) which was on the special lunch menu. It came with a free hot beverage or add only $0.75 to make it cold (some places charge 2 bucks!!!). They cut the BBQ Pork very thin, so for me they looked dry; but actually they were not. The skin of the roast pork was crispy, so the meat was not bad. But if I crave for the HK style BBQ meat, I would not come to here.

I also tried what my friends ordered. The Long Bean with Minced Pork on rice and Eggplant with Anchovy Sauce on rice were good.  But the Chicken Stir Fried Noodle with Black Bean Sauce was a bit salty. 

My friends told me the complimentary soup they offered was super super salty last time they were here, but it was okay this time."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. Order the BBQ pork and roasted pork with noodles. BBQ pork is half fat, half lean! Best way to enjoy BBQ pork. The roasted pork has a crispy skin, found the meat abit dry. The noodle is a huge portion with lots of meat. My bill came up to $10.28 with tax. Not bad for the portion"}
{"text":"BBQ Duck! It's one of my favorite places to come and grab a quick bite to eat for lunch! It's consistently good! I do wish it came with a bit more vegetables though."}
{"text":".We were in Calgary during Thanksgiving weekend. Were looking for another Chinese restaurant but couldn't find it, so we just tried our luck and went up to this place. 
 
We ordered HK style milk tea, was soooo good, better than lots of places in Hong Kong, no kidding. Also ordered two different soups, sizzling chicken pot and string beans. All very tasty, and such a bargain, since the dollar is very strong now you know.

This place was so good that we went there again during our short three days stay. This time it was for breakfast. They had big proportion combination breakfast, all so tasty and cheap and come with complimentary milk tea or coffee. 

We also tried their roast duck, sooooo good, skin soooooo crispy!

Highly recommended, would visit against if we ever go to Calgary again. 

p.s. my husband has one great complaint though? this place is too far away from San Francisco"}
