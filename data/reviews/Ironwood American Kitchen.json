{"text":"Went there for breakfast while staying at the hotel, was a buffet which our server should be able to handle...over the course of the meal, she did not pick up a single used plate or bowl - I ended up having to take them to the kitchen. She happened to see me at the door of the kitchen entrance and took them from me there. You would think she would get the hint, but after that still did not pick up a dish or ask other staff. She was very quick though to bring the bill without asking and charging my 5 year old although 5 and under are no charge. Finally I asked for a takeout cup of coffee, but left after 10 minutes without one because she never returned. Save your time and either order in room or head elsewhere for breakfast."}
{"text":"Literally the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in years. Flies everywhere, on our table, flying near our face, on our food. I got the huevos rancheros. It was basically a tostada. Menu listed \"avocado chorizo\", which I can't even imagine, and you wouldn't even be able to identify because there was such a small amount. Also came with lettuce, which wasn't even listed on the menu. Not only that, but the lettuce was smashed in between layers making it impossible to scrape off. Who puts lettuce on huevos rancheros? Eggs and lettuce are not complimentary foods. LIST ALL INGREDIENTS! Then the service. Which was almost non existent as it took them 10 minutes to even come to our table for our drink order. Halfway through our meal our server said she was taking a break and someone else would serve us. This was actually good news, or so we thought. Everyone around us had bottles of water and we were left parched with no water until we were leaving. DO NOT waste your hard earned money at this \"restaurant\". Fire the chef immediately and revamp the menu, retrain the wait staff and reopen under a different name is my recommendation."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTING! Had reservations for Christmas Eve and they ran out of Prime Rib menu item before 7pm. Only other beef entrée was a hamburger. The other entree items were chicken pot pie and fish and chips. Who runs out of Prime Rib on Christmas Eve? Especially when you know how many guests to expect? So... we ended up with a club sandwich and flatbread pizza for our Christmas Eve dinner. They seated us in a side room at a table with a dead herb plant in a mason jar as a centerpiece. Not quite the holiday ambiance I would expect from a Fairmont Resort restaurant. I could have done better at Mimi's! Will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 9:15 brunch for Sunday morning. Arrived approx 7-8 min early. Hostess apologized because she did not have a table for us so we were asked to wait in the waiting area for about 10-15 min. My husband had the buffet. I chose not to have the buffet because it didn't seem that good of quality for the price. (For example, the breakfast potato option was jo jo style potato wedges.) I ordered the eggs Benedict. They were able to substitute the bacon for avacado and tomato for no extra charge.  Our server seemed busy so he was not as attentive as I would have liked but he was very nice when he did come by our table. The atmosphere had a fun pool side/resort style vibe. It was more expensive than the quality of the food was worth. But still decent."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food, great quality ingredients. Ate here twice during our stay at the Princess Fairmont."}
{"text":"Ironwood American Kitchen is one of four restaurants located in the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort. Here are some comments:

Pros: open all day for breakfast, lunch and dinner (I think this is the only restaurant open for breakfast at the resort), convenient location for those staying at the hotel, friendly staff, big bottles of chilled water given to guests at each table, fast and responsive service, \"lifestyle plus\" menu for heart-healthy, diabetic, vegan and gluten-free needs

So-so: the food is simply \"ok\" with enough choices on the breakfast menu to satisfy everyone

Cons: pricing ($4 for drip coffee, $9 for a bowl of berries, $14 for a fruit plate, and $3 for toast which doesn't come with any of the breakfast orders)

I really didn't like the fact that I had to pay an extra $3 in addition to the $16 for my \"american breakfast\" which included eggs, bacon/sausage/ham and potatoes. The omlettes also didn't come with toast. It seemed like again, it was a cash grab. I can live with some price inflation at this restaurant since you're pretty much stuck eating here if you don't have a car but it seemed a little chintzy to not include something as simple as toast."}
{"text":"You would think a restaurant at Princess would be a little bit more up to par with their food quality. The fact that I received coleslaw in a tiny ramekin with my meal is a joke. Service was good, but the chef defiantly needs to rethink his kitchen."}
{"text":"They had dozens of seats and open tables inside and outside but they took 45 minutes to seat our six person party. I probably should have told them 4 people and separately 2. Absolutely Incompetent."}
{"text":"Very good place. Breakfast buffet is the way to go.  Buffet has plenty of choices to choose from but I have seen more choices at other hotel buffets. Servers are friendly and look to get to know their customers since so many are from out of town.  I would suggest they add Froot Loops or Lucky Charms as cereal choices for kids.  Their juices are fresh pressed and I enjoyed a glass of grapefruit juice."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to have lunch and was disappointed. The staff was a little slow but she was trying hard. The lobster roll I had was fairly small and still left me wanting more. The rest of the party I was with had the salads and all felt it was good but not over the top. If you need a quick no nonsense lunch and are staying on the grounds it will meet you needs.  The highlight was the bird patrol that carried the falcon around to keep the birds at bay.  Only ate there once even though we were at the resort all week.  I would head to the bar as a better option!"}
{"text":"I ate there several times during my stay and the food was okay, except my last meal there I ordered a French Dip sandwich that tasted a bit strange. I was at a business meal and shrugged it off, thinking it may be because it had grilled onions on it, which I normally do not like, and I did not recall seeing it on the menu. I was also quite hungry. 

Unfortunately this was a big mistake because after flying back home that evening I felt a bit ill, and went to bed. I woke up inn the middle of the night very nauseated and spent several hours in the bathroom dealing with what was clearly food poisoning. I have had it before and it is a horrible experience, and for the longest time after having it in the past I would not eat anything that seemed even a bit off flavor. I should have trusted my instincts on this, because now I am dealing with the nightmare of food poisoning and I am convinced it was that meal that did it."}
{"text":"It's decent.  Our waiter was very nice and was a hard worker; he was very attentive and made the experience a whole lot better.  The food was okay.  The pizza was good, but the salmon my mom ordered was overcooked.  I would recommend coming here if you want to have a good time and relax with your family."}
{"text":"We were staying at the hotel and decided to have breakfast here on our last day. I loved the indoor/outdoor seating and atmosphere. It was a weekday so not crowded at all (we made a reservation through Open Table but there was no wait).

Really enjoyed my breakfast sandwich. Bacon, ham, avocado, tomato and a fried egg on toasted bread - what's not to love? It was flavorful and filling. Highly recommend. Hubby had the Oscar Benedict with crab and asparagus, which he liked as well.

Fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious. But we didn't realize until we got the bill that it was also $6 each - yikes!

Service was good and fast. The menu is pricey, but at a resort like this, it's pretty much what you would expect to pay. Except for the OJ that is, lol."}
{"text":"I'd chose half a star if I could. Worst steak sandwich ever. Meat was terribly overcooked, when my sandwich came out there was no au jus. Asked my waiter to bring it out, took them like 10 minutes to bring it out! Once it was brought out, I was no longer interested in my meal. Terribly greasy sandwich with no flavor whatsoever. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"The resort that this restaurant is located in is one of my favorite resorts in Arizona. The Fairmont Princess is definitely one of my favorite places around Christmas because they go all out on decorations and activities. 

Back to this restaurant - 

We came here today for Easter brunch. Opted out of the brunch buffet because it's nicer to be able to sit and eat without someone getting up constantly to fill their plate. We also decided on this place because we were told we needed to dine at the resort in order to be able to purchase entry to \"Bunny Land.\" 

I ordered the Ironwood Frittata - egg whites with a bunch of veggies, sitting over sliced tomatoes and topped with some cheese. It was a guilt-free entree for me since I ate so much random crap the day before. To please my sweet tooth, I also got a cup of the creme brûlée oatmeal. It was so yummy! I honestly could have just ordered a large bowl of that and have been content. 

My boyfriend got the eggs Benedict and when it came out, one of the eggs was well over cooked but the server corrected it and had the kitchen make him a new order. His mother ordered just the classic American breakfast and she said her scrambled eggs were room temperature but she didn't bother to say anything about that. My boyfriend's brother had the breakfast burrito and he seemed to enjoy that very much. 

We've been here for the buffet for the 4th of July once and it was nice. Not a place we come when it's not a holiday because the other restaurants stand out more but it is perfect for when we want a family-friendly establishment."}
{"text":"Service is on top of their game at this restaurant! You are greeted swiftly and are sat quickly. The servers, hostesses and management do everything they can to make sure you are having a good time and enjoying the food. If you don't like something, they will switch it out immediately. Over the top, great customer service.

The food is okay. It's not the best, but not bad either. For the price you are paying, it would be nice to have a side or a drink included. My husband ordered the breakfast burrito, which was $18 and didn't come with anything else. With that being said, resort prices are always more expensive than other restaurants."}
{"text":"If we're being honest, my crème brûlée oatmeal was so good. I mean decadent, lick the bowl if it was socially acceptable, dessert for breakfast good. Our server was also excellent -- we arrived after breakfast had stopped and she went out of her way to work with the kitchen staff to accommodate our brunch cravings. I think her name was Chandra. 

The not so good. We waited for about 5 minutes just to be seated. The hostess looked at us repeatedly but never made an effort to help us. Another member of the serving staff eventually stepped in and showed us to our table. Additionally, prices are pretty steep for breakfast fare. I chalk this up to the sole fact that Ironwood is at the Princess. Still, because of this I wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Because The Hacienda was closed we thought we would try the American Kitchen. It is a beautiful restaurant .  Our server was excellent and friendly. 
I ordered Nachos and was impressed with how big it was. But it was terrible . My hubby had a roast beef sandwich and said it was just ok. 
 Next time we'll try The Bourbon or go back to the Hacienda ! For their yummy little tacos and margaritas!"}
{"text":"The continental breakfast is imaginative...on one dish: a yogurt parfait with fresh berries and honey, a bran muffin, and a fresh squeezed green machine type juice. I asked for a substitute to the bran muffin (it was too huge) and tried the banana nut bread and then the multi-grain toast instead...YUM! 

The service is pleasant and friendly.  

TIP: Check first if they have the daily newspapers. We had to get them from the gift shop or front desk as they seemed to be short in supply. Also, they only stock a couple of coffee flavors and one isn't vanilla :( for my soy latte addiction."}
{"text":"Five (5) of us ate lunch at the Ironwood on April 7, 2016.  Myself and another had the fish and chips; we both felt that they were sub-par: the french fries were hard and tasteless and the cod had more batter than cod.  Two others had the sesame salad which they felt was unremarkable and average at best.  The service was very good.  We won't eat there again.  Hard to believe that this is a restaurant in a Fairmont resort."}
{"text":"The restaurant at our resort was under renovation, so we walked across the parking lot to Ironwood under the recommendation of the concierge. We ordered a strawberry splash (nonalcoholic) and the cheddar burger with house chips. Our server Tim was very kind and attentive. The breakfast buffet was not available which bummed me out as I was not in the mood for a burger, salad, or pizza but it was all that was available. Since it was only a pit stop to our next destination I didn't want anything on menu really and Tim allowed us to share the burger without any problem. They even halved it for us. Most upscale eateries in NY or LA would clearly have a problem with this, but Tim was unfazed. Kudos for the great service Tim. Burger was actually good even though not what I wanted."}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Sat outside by the water fountain nice and relaxing. Food was worth it for the price."}
{"text":"The place is very friendly and the food is great. I had the Mahi mahi salad and it was great. My last meal there I had the fish tacos and they were excellent. The restaurant is inside the Fairmont Princess hotel which is very convenient. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. It was disappointing. The food wasn't very good. The service took forever and it wasn't even busy at that time. We ordered chicken pot pie and the pork shoulder. The pork shoulder was just average, nothing special about it. The taste was just...blah. The chicken pot pie, however, was quite different. We didn't expect it at all. It was served in a small saucepan with a flaky pie crust sitting on top. The filling itself was runny and it was more like creamy chicken soup. So you dip the pie crust in the soup...which is strange. I don't think that's how Chicken pot pie is supposed to be. 

Anyway, it was a very forgettable experience. It is quite overrated. Totally not worth coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered side orders for breakfast based on my diet. One egg, bacon, sausage and gravy.  

Service was wonderful, custom food options recommended and made to order, high quality food, price on par for service, location and quality.  

4 stars as have to go outside and around corner to use bathroom.  Yes I'll be personal and hate that. You build a upscale place but offsite bathrooms are tacky.."}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience I might have ever had.  We went to Christmas at the Princess last night and chose this restaurant since we have small kids.  We ordered appetizers and mac n cheese for our 2 year old right away to get him occupied.  None of these came.  At least half an hour later, when our food came, they remembered the appetizers.  We had to special request our sons order and of course he was antsy by this point.  The food was less than memorable.  Some of our party had to send their burgers back due to them being undercooked.  Another member of our party ordered a burger and got a chicken sandwich.  The prices were in the $16 dollar range for a burger which is very expensive for what was terrible service and food.  The server rarely checked on us and we kept having to get up and as for things we needed.  To top it all off, when they finally brought the bill it was totally wrong and jumbled so we had to sit and write out specifically what went on each of our 2 bills in order to get it right.  When we mentioned to the manager how terrible the experience was he was confrontational stating that he had removed the late appetizers and undercooked burgers from the bill and wasn't that enough.  I'd recommend eating eating before going to the Princess if you have kids.  Or choose one of the other restaurants if you aren't bringing kids and have a larger budget.  Definitely avoid this restaurant as literally everything was a mess from the moment we walked in on.  And you'd hope for friendly at least, but the servers barely cracked a smile and had quite an edge to them."}
{"text":"Happened by for breakfast while staying at this lovely resort.  Breakfast buffet is $22 and includes coffee or tea. Hubby chose the buffet and I opted for the crab Benedict.   The Benedict was clearly, hands down, the best ever. Big chunks of crab.  Served with an amazing micro greens salad.  It was $17 and I was still a little hungry so I ordered the potatoes and multigrain toast.  Mainly the toast to try the cherry jam on the table.

Ambiance is nice and we laughed at the comical birds on the patio.

Service was great and we had an awesome start to our day of relaxation."}
{"text":"The food was pretty average. The place was empty but the service was pretty slow. Seemed like the servers were a but under staffed. For the price there are about 10 other places near by that are much better."}
{"text":"Who would have thought my number one takeaway from eating here would be \"good for groups,\" but it is! Recently, I planned a girl's day for some of my friends. We were going to do a spa party at Willow Stream but I wanted to plan a lunch before we went. Since we were going to be at the Princess, I decided to stay in-house and chose Ironwood. Initially, I booked a table on the patio overlooking the pretty pool, but when the day of the event arrived the chilly temperatures made an outdoor table obsolete. I called to change the reservation and they happily complied and told me that they had a small room off the restaurant that could hold 11. 

I showed up a little early and the table was already set and ready to go. I noticed that they also have a table of different fun games so I grabbed a \"Foodie Fight\" game just in case we wanted it. Throughout the meal, the waitress was friendly, helpful and fast! She separated our tabs and before we could even blink and eye, she presented individual tabs to us at the end of the meal. It was the most seamless paying process for a group meal I've ever experience. Not to mention that the food was good too! I've eaten at the spa before and was happy to learn that they offer that menu in Ironwood in addition to their regular menu. I ordered the yogurt curry chicken lettuce wraps which were low in fat but high in flavor. Everything about the meal was lovely and I would definitely come back with a group."}
{"text":"I had lunch at the Ironwood while at a meeting at the Fairmont Princess and it was great.  There is a pretty expansive menu which made it hard to pick what to eat.  I am a cauliflower lover so I had to order the carmelized caulifower and it might be one of my fav cauli dishes Ive ever had!  I loved the salty/sweet combo of the golden raisins and capers with the roasted cauliflower!  I also tried the turkey club which was as I expected, classically yummy!  Trish was an excellent server as well!"}
{"text":"Different but good. The Big Daddy was more like a cheese steak, fries extra crunchy. The chicken skewers and crab cakes were the best."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast today. I ended up creating my own omelet. The waiter was nice. I have to eat gluten free and they had Gluten Free bread. OUTSTANDING. They also game me a gluten free muffin. The price is a little high, but I loved my breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast during a little staycation at the princess! We both loved the food and atmosphere. The restaurant is really big! Nice high ceilings too. It was busy but we still got seated fairly quickly and had good service. 
At first we thought about doing the buffet, but it's $28 and the selection didn't look all that great. We ordered off the menu which I think was the better choice for us! I got whole wheat pancakes and my boyfriend got a waffle. Everything was absolutely delicious. Although we thought it was odd that my portion of food was significantly larger than my boyfriends even though our meals were the same price. He loved the waffle though, the whipped cream on top was amazing! My favorite part of the pancakes was the cinnamon butter on top, yum. It was very expensive for breakfast, but it's a hotel restaurant so that is to be expected."}
{"text":"Our family had lunch here the day after Christmas. The service was excellent but two of us ordered the steak sandwiches and they we not even worth eating. With out question the worst sandwiches we have ever had."}
{"text":"I had a lunch, a business meeting and two breakfasts here, so there's a lot that I can say. 

Lunch: 
Southwest Chop - probably the largest salad on their menu (some of my coworkers ordered other salads, and they were definitely much smaller). It had a delicious dressing. 
Turkey Club - SO MUCH TURKEY on this club, literally unbelievable amounts of salad. 

Breakfast: 
Biscuits & Gravy - not the best I've ever had, because there were no sausage chunks in my gravy, but pretty good. 
Buttermilk pancakes - a little crispy on the outside, amazingly fluffy. Was delivered barely lukewarm. 
Belgian waffles - I had to duck out right after I ordered and by the the time I got back it was cold, but still quite good! I got a side of bacon, which was absolutely not worth the $6 they charged for it. 

I also had the green tea, which is really adorably presented, with a little pot of honey and some sugar cubes, which was nice, and the service was fast and friendly. I do wish that they had informed us that the coffee ($6) and orange juice ($8) with breakfast were not complimentary - they were already sitting on the table when I arrived, so we assumed that they were. 

Overall: probably closer to 3.5 stars but, since I didn't pay for any of this food, all of which was included in the cost of the resort, I bumped it up to 4."}
{"text":"We came for an early dinner that no one was in the restaurant, but us. It was a little warm, but I thought the restaurant was nice - white, fresh and airy with plenty of tall windows to look out. We really weren't too hungry so we just settled on the nachos. The server told us the nachos are incredible with the pork and it was a good size. Unfortunately, I didn't think the nachos were that good and so if I didn't think the nachos were good, I expected that if I order anything else, it would just be as bad. We didn't even finish the nachos and left. Prices are above average and definitely not worth it, but you have to expect those prices at a restaurant like this in a five star resort."}
{"text":"We made a stop at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort for lunch and ended up at the Ironwood American Kitchen.   

Pros:   

Nice setting, we sat on the patio with a view of the pool.

Good service.

Liked that they left big bottles of water on the table since it was close to 85 degrees during our visit.  Nice touch.


Cons:   

Food was so so.  We ordered two different salads and neither was remarkable.   They told us they had just gone to a farm to table concept.  I guess that's why the servers all wear jeans.   

At lunch we were presented a cocktail menu where our server pointed to the limited selection of cocktails they could make during the afternoon.  We ordered two different margaritas.  One was their regular, the other was the special.   Neither were good.


Maybe it would be a better place to try for dinner.   They could do a much better job on their lunch menu and food preparation."}
{"text":"Visited this place for breakfast on my first morning during my stay. Breakfast was standard fare, I wouldn't say this place was better or worse than any other bacon and eggs you would get anywhere else, however, for close to twenty bucks a plate you would expect to receive much better service. My main issue here and reason for two stars is consistent with my Fairmont review in the type of service you receive. A smoothie that was ordered contained hard and sharp piece of plastic that was picked up just over half way done with the drink, which basically meant the rest of the drink was not finished. When mentioned and shown to the waiter as he was picking up the plates and paying the bill his response was \"oh my that's strange\" and that was the end of that. To be honest, I'm not sure what I was looking for as a response but I don't think it was that. Needless to say this was the last visit to this restaurant, DoorDash your breakfast in."}
{"text":"i had lunch today at the ironwood american kitchen at the scottsdale princess and it was the WORSE food I've had.
I had the turkey burger....the meat tasted and had the consistency of spam. If not for the condiments the meal would have been inedible. (the meat was inedible)
A friend had pastrami that she did not eat because of taste as well. 
very disappointing..."}
{"text":"Ok so the restaurant is beautiful but wild birds apparently come and go from inside the restaurant. Even saw one headed to the kitchen area. The waiter said oh they fly in and out all the time. Can someone call the health department. This could get someone really sick. Nope."}
{"text":"I looooove the Fairmont at Scottsdale no doubt about that. We enjoyed our time there and all the amenities they have to offer. On our last day we had lunch at Ironwood. Big mistake. There were 2 birds flying around the restaurant. That, I do not mind at all as they were cute to look at. But imagine if they POOP on your food?

What we did mind were the multitude of FLIES hovering over us and on ourselves food! I heard the table beside us having the same problem and mentioning it to their server and their reasoning was because it's the monsoon season. So it's normal. Are you kidding me?!

Our female server were all of a sudden nowhere in site when we had to pay for our check and had to ask probably one of their hostess to take our card and give us to go containers. Despite that, we still gave a great tip. I mean, what the heck?!

I can not understand how the birds and flies could enter the restaurant?! What is going on?!"}
{"text":"We just arrived for breakfast and were greeted by a hostess sneering, as if to say \"oh no, not more customers\".  Her attitude seating us was no better. 

The Fairmont would do well to remember that people are primarily paying for service."}
{"text":"Yikes. I'm usually a very generous review giver. It took 50 mins for food to get there and only when we asked did they start cooking it. Didn't ask how we wanted the burgers cooked. The chop salad with chicken had a nasty bone in it and almost made my friend's date choke. When we complained to the manager he said they'd take 20% off, salt in the wound. Our waitress rarely checked on us. We needed more catsup and had to finish our fries dry. Lastly she mixed up our validated valet cards so we didn't know which car we were going to get. Surprise!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a nice breakfast by the window. Friendly prompt service and food cooked to order.  Their menu had something for everyone and items that went from healthy to hearty.  We enjoyed the Quoina Egg White Burrito - very fresh and light.  The kale/ ginger juice was so refreshing and a great starter to your morning!  I'd recommend this place for a quick bite and start to your day  ?"}
{"text":"We wanted to celebrate Christmas at the famous Fairmont Scottsdale Princess resort and took advantage of their Christmas event dining deal.

Parking rates:
Self-parking: $55 per personal vehicle
Valet-parking: $85 per personal vehicle
Ride sharing or walking: $20 per person 

OR

Spend a minimum of $75 at one of the selected Princess restaurant and receive a maximum of 4 admissions to Christmas at the Princess event.

We settled for Ironwood American Kitchen because the other restaurants were fully booked and didn't accept anymore walk-ins. Lesson of the day: make a reservation in advance for the Christmas event. 

Pot roast ($28.00): we ordered pot roast, but the worker called it short rib and the receipt listed the dish as short rib. It was meh. 

Prime rib ($36.00): the prime rib edible. Where is my au jus? After few bites I noticed that my au jus was served with the pot roast. 

Iced coffee Baileys ($13.00): I could barely taste the coffee.  It tasted like Baileys with brown water. 

Great service. Our waitress was funny, helpful,  and friendly. We couldn't stop laughing and she made us feel like regulars.

2 stars!!

Ironwood American Kitchen is not yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"Takes forevvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvver.  Food was okay, but we mostly just sat there, waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting for our drinks, and waiting some more.  Since they are the only breakfast option at the Princess, they are default busy, but we arrived for breakfast and didn't get our food until nearly lunch.  To make matters worse, you aren't getting resort quality food for the resort prices.  Evidently they are charging by the hour."}
{"text":"Busy during lunch. Service and food is ok. Nothing special. Waiters talk too much... and they dont care or have the fairmont sense of service... typical hotel food. Food came in cold. Its good if you want something casual. Compared to the other restaurants in the area i wouldnt recommend it. Ambience is so-so."}
{"text":"Food is meh. Very plain. Service was actually quite terrible. It's the Fairmont. You'd think they would be polite and ready to help. Nope."}
{"text":"I love Ironwood, except I've only had the chance to eat here with their lunch/dinner menu. Its the restaurant located on the first floor near the pool at the Fairmont, and its  a beautiful place to get food when its nice out. Very open floor plan with a LOT of windows. 
The service is great, I've never had my water glass go less than 3/4ths of the way down. There are a couple of great dishes (in my opinion). My favorite is the Spanish Ham flatbread with fig and herb/parmesan cheese.. delicious. Everything is made fresh to order, including their juices.(get an iced tea to go as well!) 
My second favorite dish is the pan salmon, its straight oven to table, so its extremely hot when you get it, still in its original baking dish. Its in this yellow pepper sauce which is delightfully paired with asparagus and mushrooms.
They have childrens menus and even little leap pads for the kids to play with while the adults enjoy their meal. I've even seen them give kids little sunglasses on their way out/in. 
The menu for lunch and dinner is the same, and lunch is served typically starting at 11:30am. 
Everyone RAVES about their breakfast, but I havent been able to try it yet. 
If you're in the fairmont area and want a casual atmosphere with great service and phenomenally fresh food, this is your place. 
But, if you want mexican food... you HAVE to go to la hacienda on the same property."}
{"text":"Ate the breakfast buffet here because family was in town and staying at the Fairmont and they wanted to use some breakfast buffet vouchers.  Let me just say, the buffet is $28 without a voucher.  Automatically that sets you up for expecting some better than average breakfast!

I have to say that the breakfast here was just average.  The oatmeal was a little thick and gloppy.  I wanted to thin it out with soy milk (I can't drink dairy) but they didn't have any.

Other foods were pretty good.  I loved the bacon!!  And I liked the fruit (melon, cantaloupe, watermelon, pineapple).  They will also make you an omelette if you want, but I didn't bother.  Some other stuff they had that I didn't try: waffles, cereal, yogurt, sausage.

They do have ADORABLE little condiments, like a tiny Tabasco bottle, tiny ketchup bottles, little jams, a small pot of honey. It seems a little wasteful, but the small packaging is so adorable!  The patio is nice and shaded, but we ate inside on this day since it was a little chilly.  Lots of birds coming by to eat crumbs, so there was some fun bird watching.  Also some birds came in the building!

Service was friendly, but one annoying thing is we gave her the vouchers at the beginning of the meal, yet she still rang us up for the breakfast buffet and we had to remind her about the vouchers.

p.s. they validate for valet"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on our first morning. Choose the buffet since it was cost effective which was small but had the major breakfast items which would fill you up just fine. The service was absolutely fantastic with politeness, attentiveness, and a great experience.  The manager heard it was our 2 year anniversary and gave us amazing chocolate strawberries and champagne!  He was also very helpful with my gluten free needs (FYI the gf bread was great and from a local bakery). 
Points off for hostess not being terribly friendly and not having sugar at the table for my coffee.
The decor is nice but with the weather I didn't get a chance to enjoy outside seating which has a view of the pool."}
