{"text":"Will start with saying this may not be the best place to go in the winter, as it is just a food truck in a shipping container. As for the food it is actually quite good. The poutine had squeaky cheese curds which is not something you often see but there was too much gravy and it tasted a bit too strong.  Girlfriend ordered a savoury crepe which she enjoyed quite a lot and seemed like a reasonable portion of food for the price. Finished he meal off with a desert crepe with peanut butter, Nutella and bananas. Crepe was delicious and for $5 you can't go wrong.  Will definitely go back once it warms up again."}
{"text":"Its just a stall but the poutine is AMAZING. Possibly the best I've ever had. And cheap too.  The guy is also super friendly.  Never tried the crepes but I plan to"}
{"text":"It's 3.5.  I only tried the original poutine for $5.97.  They have a promotion going on 2 traditional poutine for $10.    Overall an above average poutine.  Fries were too soft for my liking.  Gravy was okay.  Cheese curds were very good and squeaky.  I will try their other poutines next time and maybe their crepes.  Decent place for poutine if you are around the area."}
{"text":"Tried my first crepe here and I'm already a huge fan. Small little roadside booth with very friendly quick service."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff made my first meal of Canadian poutine perfect. Warm and fresh on a chilly and rainy day."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday (June 18) with a few friends. Was excited to have some poutine here; decided to order the traditional poutine. It was heavenly! The right amount of gravy (not too much, not too little), the cheese curds squeaking and the fries being crispy... hands down, the best poutine I've ever had in Toronto.  (edit: and all of my friends agree too)!"}
{"text":"Tried their Parisienne and Montreal Smoked Meat poutine and wow were they good. Great flavor, soft cheese, and the perfect portion size as well. Definitely now my go-to poutine spot!"}
{"text":"|| Must Try: Smoked Meat Poutine, Prosciutto Crepe, S'mores Crepe  || Rating: (9/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  || My Experience:    Came here off a recommendation from BlogTo's Poutine list, Nom Nom Nom topped the list as #1. Located on Dundas, in a cute little street vendor spot, this place knocked it out of the park. The fries were a perfect texture, with tons of fresh cheese curds and a big helping of Schwart'z Montreal smoked meat to top. We had a difficult time deciding what to order, since a bunch of the poutine's sounded AMAZING.   This shop doesn't over do it with convoluted ingredients, and excessive toppings; they stick with good, well balanced items. Although their menu has unique items, none of them are over the top with some unreasonable combinations.   There crepes are also fresh and made to order, with both savoury options and sweet options.   A great hidden gem in Toronto, and gives the other poutine places a run for their money!"}
{"text":"This teensy crepe shop has set up in Market 707, which is a row of shipping containers at Dundas and Bathurst that have been retrofitted to host food stalls. It is the first of its kind in Toronto, but a second shipping container market is being set up this summer. It's a new take on street food, and I approve. The owner is super nice and he makes a good crepe. They have both sweet and savoury crepes, with two veg options. The low rent allows for very reasonable prices, which I enjoy. They have some outdoor seating set up in front, where you can enjoy the flowers on the roof, in wooden planters built by a woodworking class of kids from the local high school. I was here as part of a food tour, so we only got a few samples. I will need to go back to try the sweet crepes, and the delicious looking grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"My grand search has finally concluded. I have found Montreal-quality poutine in Toronto. The sublimely squeaky cheese curds are imported fresh from Quebec, the gravy is perfect, and the fries are cooked fresh to order. Blog TO got it right when they dubbed this dish the best poutine in Toronto. It really is far, far superior to any other Toronto-based poutine I've ever had. It even ranks in my top 3 poutine experiences. The owner who runs the place is super chirper young guy, as Quebecois as his delicious food. Thank you to him and baby Jesus for this incredible food that tastes like baby angels."}
{"text":"Top notch poutine. The Montreal smoked meat was especially good! The death by chocolate crepe was great with the offered bananas instead of strawberries."}
{"text":"Awesome poutine.  Fries were super crispy (though a teensy bit thin for my taste). Gravy was rich and piping hot. Curds were fantastic!! Fresh, squeaky and unbelievably tasty. Most curds are just neutral, more about texture than taste, but these curds had it all going on... springy AND subtly savourily delicious!  Generous poartion; 1 is enough for 2ppl to share. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best....poutine....in....Toronto.  Serously.  We tried several places in Toronto for poutine and this was the place that we couldn't stop thinking about.  It's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"At $5-6 (tax included) per crepe, you truly cannot go wrong! This is a hidden gem right behind the hospital on Dundas."}
{"text":"Such a tiny kitchen but the menu is quite large. All the items are fairly priced and I will be back to try the crepes!   We had the smoked meat poutine, which is one of the most popular poutines along with the traditional. Made to order--I love fresh fries! There was a generous portion of meat, cheese curds and there was just the right amount of sauce. Mind you, we ate outside in the 10Â°C weather and  the poutine definitely warmed me up and reactivated all my senses! Loved it. The poutine is also packaged in a resealable container so you can take it home if you don't finish it.   Great service as well. Come with a friend and get 2 traditional poutines for $10."}
{"text":"So this place has been open a couple months already? And now it's on Yelp. I couldn't help but try this after-swim summertime spot outside Alexandra Pool at Market 707 which is also the Dundas stretch east of Bathurst known as Scadding Court Community Center. Headquarters for businesses in boxes ranging from a barber to a bicycle repair guy, this experiment in street level goodness has my attention whenever I get hungry and I'm nearby. Last week it was Gushi's lovely fried chicken and this week it's Oh My Lard. Tasty barbeque is what these guys specialize in and they will leave you wanting more. We tried the pulled pork on a Jamaican coco bun and topped with a slice of pineapple, and it was delicious and substantial for $7. The other item we tried was the slightly charred corn-on-the-cob which was coated with a sauce they call Tequila Sunrise (brown sugar, cinnamon, lemon juice) and it was unbelievably good! They were sold out of burgers which is on my must-try list now, but had the caveman style beef ribs and they looked great! Try some soon!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food awesome but the guy running the store is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  Food is hot and fresh.  Do not pass this small place up!!"}
{"text":"Great poutine!  Some great varieties. I had duck confit and the one with chicken and Brie. Everything is made fresh to order.  This is in a shipping container, think food truck.  Some picnic tables outside to sit at."}
{"text":"This is a sweet little spot among several food shipping containers. While the service was pleasant and accommodating, the poutine was sub-par.  I really appreciated that the gravy was vegetarian, but after having poutine in Montreal with squeaky-ass curds, this just had no chance.  I went with the traditional, and it quickly became a wet, melted mess. Maybe I just haven't had enough poutine, but this definitely wasn't my favorite. Good for vegetarians, bad for cheese snobs."}
{"text":"Wow. The poutine here was everything you want poutine to be ... the portions are generous and very sharable, the food was fresh and delicious, and the services was friendly and fast. There is no seating, except for a couple of picnic tables out front, so you'll either have to grab-and-go or maybe make some new friends. Regardless, highly, highly recommend!!  BTW - no more crepes."}
{"text":"Soooo good! I got the original poutine and it was just right. I would get this over other poutine specific restaurants in the city. I'll be back to try the smoked meat and maybe the crepes!"}
{"text":"One of the best poutines I've ever had! It beats any New York Fries, Costco, Ikea, or fast food chains! There's sooo many poutineries in Toronto, but this place is just great, so straight forward with their food. I'll be focusing on the food and service.  Now, their poutines are everything you could ever want in something. Crispy but melt-in-your-mouth fries, savoury gravy that doesn't just taste like salt and squeaky and melty cheese curds! The gravy is piping hot which helps melt the cheese slighty, and makes the fries a tiny bit softer while still keeping the crisp. I got the pulled pork poutine which has very tender and flavorful pork that is soooo smokey and tangy. I was skeptical at first because I know pulled pork on poutine sometimes isn't the greatest, either too salty, too sour, too tough, or too saucy. But this was perfect! Wonderful tender pork that has some soft and crispy bits, so you know its the real deal! They're super generous with the gravy, but not too much that it's a soup. Cheese curds were the right amount. And the whole container of food will fill you right up, the price is decent for the amount. They also have many other types of poutines with different toppings, even a veggie one! I'd rate this 5/5, yippee!  The service here was great, I cam on a weekday, so it wasn't busy, but there were people who I saw eating poutines (benches near the area) and people ordering. I love the concept of a storage unit as a street food area, very new and creative! The guy who served the food was suuuuper nice and friendly. The food took no time at all, and didn't keep me waiting too long :) I'd rate this 5/5 also!  Overall, a very delicious poutine joint to hit up, right near Chinatown, located in a storage unit with benches outside for easy sitting! Good food, great customer service, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"After a whole week of running around and having no time for anything anymore, I just wanted some good old poutine. What better place than Nom Nom! My friend is the one who recommended this place and told me there usually is a line up. Well wasn't it my lucky day. It was raining like crazy outside and I still wanted to mission it downtown to check this place out. As soon as I arrived it was such a cute little area on the side of road where all these food trucks were lined up side by side. It was raining so badly that I told my friend that he was closer to the food truck to order a original poutine for me with extra gravy. When we looked outside not a single soul in line. Wihoo!! There was a deal 2 original poutines for $10 so that's exactly what we ordered. When we asked for extra gravy he said it was on the house because it wasn't busy that day. Now that's just gang! It took about 10 minutes luckily my friend took my umbrella while he waited outside to chit chat with the owner. When he got in to the car it smelled so good and the food was piping hot. I just dug in and the cheese curds were perfectly textured and nice and squeaky in my mouth (let's keep the jokes for later haha!). This was one of the best poutines I ever had, these Quebecers know what's up! The portion size is huge and my food never got cold. It was delicious and I will definitely come back to Nom Nom's and get more creative with my poutine now that I know the original poutine is on point. Totally make your way down to this place for some cheesy gooey goodness :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST vegetarian poutine in the city (so glad the gravy is veg!) and I have tried many since I am a poutine fiend who also happens to be vegetarian! Reasonably priced, big portion, friendly service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very delicious fries and such a unique and beautiful community. The location is near Kensington market and Chinatown so I recommend you to check them out if you are in the area. There are also other food carts here as well if fries are not your preferred food of choice.   The man working there told me they are open all year round and there is an app where you can preorder and pick up later so you don't have to wait outside during the winter.   I gave it a star less because the cheese was quite hard and not melted enough. It might be due to the fact that the gravy was not hot enough. Other than that, it is yummmmyyyy"}
{"text":"Go here. The best poutine we've had. We had the original, the duck confit and the pulled pork. All were amazing, but note the pork has BBQ sauce. This is not an enclosed restaurant, it's a food stand with some outdoor tables. If it's a cold day, you can eat indoors at the nearby community center. Just try it!"}
{"text":"Besides the fact that every time I come to this establishment something is always sold out. Not a bad thing just means I wasn't hungry enough to make the trip here during the afternoon. Great guy making your crepes though, always substitutes when something runs out and doesn't charge you extra! great customer service! He didn't have strawberries or brownies but made me a s'mores crepe with bananas how awesome! Haven't had the savoury food here since this is just my second stop after hitting up Gushi chicken for some bomb chicken, one day I'll get this Montreal style poutine everyone talks about. Recommend the crepes and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We heard such great things about this place, but weren't super impressed with the plain old poutine. My husband had been looking really forward to it but ended up not being a huge fan. I had a crepe and while it was nice and big and cheesy, the spinach flavor was overpowering - I wish it had been seasoned a bit more to balance the loads of spinach. Overall, it was a nice lunch stop."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a wait to get this poutine. And while I was waiting I was thinking, I can't imagine myself coming here very often if this is a normal wait.  But I changed my mind. The poutine was awesome - perfect fries, flavourful gravy, and real cheese curds. Each poutine is made fresh to order - which is why the wait and why it's so good. I got the traditional, but they have some creative poutines as well - including duck confit!  There were no seats available when I got there but I grabbed a spot on the library bench nearby. And I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"poutine is such a classic in canada... if you say you wanted poutine in the states, all you get is shredded marble cheese and soggy fries! No one does poutine better than canada. I was so excited to hear about nom nom nom poutine, especially since the owner makes his own cheese curd! For lunch, my friend and I decided to order from them on foodora. We opted for the smoked meat and also the ground beef with crispy onion poutine. They were quick in making and delivering the product to the point that the cheese curd were not fully melted yet! (my favourite) In my order, a heaping amount of smoked meat was given with lots of cheesecurd. Cheesecurds were super squeaky and the fries were fresh and not soggy! The gravy was not overly salty and the flavour fit very well all together. My friend who ordered the ground beef one was sad that no crispy onion was provided!!! but she also agreed that the cheese was delicious and the fries were flavourful and good. Next time that i'm around the area, I would definitely like to try it live. It is also in an area of different cargo units so its quite unique and definitely there are other places to check out around there!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying legitimate Canadian poutine. I had the one with duck. In general it was delicious and exceeded my expectations. The portion size was pretty big (which I was thankful for because I was starving that day). The cheese curds were squeaky, which I had heard was what you wanted in good poutine. The gravy was also rich, but maybe a little on the salty side. All in all, I'm pleased with my first experience of poutine!"}
{"text":"I think Blog T.O. got it right when they ranked nom nom nom crepes as the best poutine hub in they city! The stand can't be any larger than a hot dog cart, but it's unbelievable what glorious food is produced in such a tiny area. I believe the man working at the stand was in fact the owner, as he seemed so passionate and genuinely happy with what he was doing, it was wonderful :) He also explained how he has a loyalty card set up; get a stamp for every $4 spent, get 10 stamos and you get a free crepe! Probably one of the best, if not the best, loyalty card I've ever seen. Serving both sweet and savoury crepes, and about 8 exquisite poutine flavours, I opted for the Parisienne poutine ; crispy onions,homemade gravy, fries cooked freah right before your eyes, cheese curds,  seasoned chicken breast (which was so so moist and flavourful),  and the piece de resistance,  slices of Brie cheese :')   The way the Brie stretched and pulled and oozed and goozed....it was really too good to be true! I've tried many poutines in my life, and I gotta say, I don't think this one will be beat! Especially considering the fact that it's such a tiny stand, with such a passionate owner running it, that makes me even more intrigued to give my business to him.  Please, help nom nom nom crepes grow, and help yourself by indulging in the tastiest poutine our city has to offer!"}
{"text":"This was one of our planned stops at Market 707 on our downtown food trip. The three of us shared a traditional poutine (about $5.50). According to one of their signs, BlogTO rates this as one of the best places to get poutine in Toronto. We thought it was pretty average all around. My friend said some of her larger pieces of cheese curd squeaked, but none of mine did. I'm not jealous. I'm not a fan of squeaky curds. The portion was not bad for the price, but I would not come downtown just to get this poutine."}
{"text":"First taste of poutine - found thanks to Yelp - and it wad delicious! I really wasn't sure what to expect from cheese curds (sounds gross!), but they were like little nuggets of mild cheddar-flavoured haloumi - yum :)  The gravy wad rich and just salty enough, the chips were tasty and soaked through with the gravy that they were absolutely SWIMMING in, and the portion was really generous, especially with the 2 for $10 classic deal (plus tax... seems most if not all prices on display in Toronto are without tax - worth noting if you're on a holiday budget!) Unfortunately I didn't experience the cheese curds squeak, but my friend did so she's officially poutine-initiated ;) Then we couldn't resist a smore crepe! There was a bit of a misunderstanding following seeing another person get a crepe with brownie and marshmallows and thinking it was the smore one - nope, that was their creation, the smore one had nutella, marshmallows and graham cracker chunks. Still delicious though, and I never knew marshmallows puffed up and went all foamy when melted!  The stall is part of a small food market on a random street curve, but there are a couple of tables and I would recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Truly delicious, straight forward, flavorful poutine. Despite Toronto's plethora of poutine options, few have come close to satisfactory, let alone mouth-watering-thinking-on-when-to-return-already good. Nom Nom Nom Poutine delivers.   The humble spot offers poutines that will surely make you smile. I ordered the traditional with extra gravy to see what this spot was all about. It was outstanding. The fries were fresh, piping hot, and retained their crispiness throughout the entire eating process (not going to lie though, it was devoured rather quickly). They were well seasoned - not too much, not too little. The cheese curds used were perfectly squeaky and remained their wonderful texture despite the piping hot gravy. It was a more than generous portion of fries and cheese.  The gravy was definitely one of the best poutine gravies I have had in an extremely long time. I appreciated how generous they ladled on the gravy when I asked for extra, as usually I find they don't put as much as I like (I like a LOT of gravy). The taste was wonderful and complimented the seasoned fries and cheese curds. It was a great consistency - not thick or goopy and not thin or runny. Literally just right. I shared the order with one other individual and we were definitely satisfied :). Will definitely be returning and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"One of multiple colorful and funky street food stalls,  this poutine place serves up a great value. They offer two huge orders of traditional poutine for just $10, with a great (vegetarian!) gravy and thick-cut fries. My only tiny and almost irrelevant complaint is that I would have preferred smaller cheese curds. They really are huge portions, and for such a great price you really can't go wrong. When it's cold out, you can sit in the community center right next door which is really nice!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the smoked meat and hotdog poutine. They were good! The owner is very nice and there is a bench in front so you can sit down and eat. The portions are huge and the toppings are very generous. The fries could be a bit more crispier but it's super tasty.  I give this joint 3 stars because it is literally off the street that has heavy traffic.. Like dusty, windy, loud, busy traffic.. The price is also not cheap, although greater variety and portion it's not 'affordable' (unless you get the original which is around $5). After the meal, my boyfriend and I became very thirsty. We are very sensitive to MSG and I know this is a common to use them (some foods need them, like pho lol) but becoming super thirsty told us that they use a lot of it which was a slight disappointment."}
{"text":"Wow can't believe so little people have reviewed this place. My favorite poutine in the city. Made after you place your order. I've found Smoke's can taste a little stale as if the fries have been sitting around awhile. They are a great price and huge portions.  Selling out of a little shipping container wouldn't expect such tasty food. I love this place."}
{"text":"Read a review that said they served the most authentic poutine in Toronto. Hopped on the 505 streetcar and headed for the address only to find that the article did not mention it was in a shipping container on the sidewalk. Nevertheless, the cook explained my options and I got the Montreal smoked meat version with extra gravy. It was pretty good. Too cold to sit outside so I found a table in the community center. Not the best atmosphere but I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"really great service! friendly and helpful. the parisienne poutine I had was great but the portions are just too big for me (I know, hardly a bad thing, but for me it means I end up feeling stuffed and also wasteful when I throw half of it away at the end).   i've not had a lot of poutine yet, but out of nom nom nom, poutineville, smoke's, the bbq restaurant on centre island, and the burger shoppe on queen east, the latter was by far my favourite."}
{"text":"Just went there for lunch, great crepe for a great price! :)  only 3.75 for a strawberries and Nutella crepe ^_^ I recommend"}
{"text":"Amazing poutine at a great price. The area is really nice with side table that you can eat at. Honestly not much to say beside this is probably one of the best poutine I have eaten my whole life."}
{"text":"Went here after reading all the great reviews but wasn't too impressed. I've had better."}
{"text":"DIS WAS DA BOMB. This place uses vegetarian gravy AND offers halal meat. MAJOR WIN.  Okay, but seriously. That poutine. WOW. I'll let the other reviews go into more detail, but trust me - you won't be disappointed.   Shoutout to the dude behind the counter for the super great attitude!"}
{"text":"Ordered the montreal smoked meat poutine and it was beyond heavenly! The cheese curds squeak, the gravy has the right consistency and flavor and the fries are nice and crispy. Hands down one of the best poutines in all of Toronto. I almost finished the whole thing by myself!   I will def. come back to try the other poutine variants and the crepes. Keep up the awesome poutines!"}
{"text":"Great poutine and crepes! All at affordable prices to boot! You can't go wrong with the classic poutine with fresh cut fries, delicious gravy and authentic cheese curds. The owner is so friendly too :)"}
{"text":"The best poutine and crepes I've had in Toronto and at a good price too! I had the Smoked Meat Poutine and the Strawberry, Banana and Nutella Crepe. Great service as well, which I truly appreciate."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom de dieu its good. I mean seriously, this is poutine good enough to be blasphemous for. Just had the basic poutine - fries, cheese curds and gravy. Three ingredients that were impeccably executed resulting in exactly what poutine was meant to be. If you want poutine, don't waste your time anywhere else."}
{"text":"The best poutine I have had in Toronto, and I am from Quebec, so I would know excellent poutine! Cheese curds are absolutely perfect! Recommend the sausage extra cheese poutine :)!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I came at a bad time or perhaps I drew the short end of the stick, but the poutine I ate was absolutely disappointing.   The fries were old, stale, and scrawny. The curds tasted like RUBBER (I started questioning if I was eating bubble gum at this point). And even the gravy that the fries were drowned in couldn't salvage any shred of hope of it tasting anything remotely close to decent.   I'm not a picky eater. As long as it's edible, I don't really complain all that much. Needless to say, my friend and I couldn't even finish a quarter of it before throwing it away.   Hopefully others can enjoy fresh batches of poutine from this place, cause I don't think I'll ever stop by here again if I'm craving a snack..."}
{"text":"Our first experience with shipping container restaurants and man do I wish we had these in Atlanta. Just cheap, amazing food. We got the duck poutine and it was exactly everything I want when I think of classic poutine. Great fries, melty curds, tender duck, yummy salty gravy. It was pretty cold outside, but we ordered and ate it immediately. I'm hungry just thinking about this poutine."}
{"text":"I tried this place after reading the reviews, but my experience was not as good as the others had. Pretty average poutine tbh. The fries were almost burnt, the gravy wasn't that tasty and the curds were meh. I ordered the smoked meat one. Maybe it was a bad day for them, but I rather hit Smokes than trying this one again."}
{"text":"I'm impressed how one guy in a stall effectively serves so many people within a reasonable time frame. I've been coming here for years and I'm always coming back to try something different. From ice cream to crepes, to poutine and other stuff there's something for everyone. This pop up is part of the scadding court market where vendor's come and go as the seasons go by, but this guy is always there even during the winter. The crepe itself isn't as tasty as some other places but the combination of fillings really does stand out.  Winter is coming, and that means that all of the extra seating goes away (as my experience over 3 years) so it might not be that great for groups moving forward. In all great service, great food in a nice neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Pretty good, though if I returned, I would stick to the original. I ordered the pulled pork poutine, but was not impressed by the pork. My friends got the original, and it looked like better value. I enjoyed the real cheese \"squeaky\" curds, and the gravy, which was not overly sweet or salty. The fries were not bad either, though I prefer them crispier. Pretty disappointed to learn that they don't sell crepes anymore. I would have loved one!"}
{"text":"Went out of our way to find this place because I read they had amazing poutine. Worth the traveling. It really was spot on amazing. Served out of a storage container this place is hip. $10 for two huge portions of poutine. The fries were crisp and held up to the creamy gravy well. Topped with a huge portion of squeaky white cheese curds this was a fantastic meal.   You have to stop by!"}
{"text":"Quebec expat here, I am always curious when I see a place selling poutine. Stopped here to grab lunch, pretty good classic poutine! Squeaky cheese, nice rich brown sauce and crunchy fries! Happy with my experience! Will try again their other options!"}
{"text":"Quirky street cart that knows how to make a mean poutine. The gravy was delicious and not overpowering. The combinations were inventive. My friends got the drunken sailor and the pulled pork."}
{"text":"I frequent Kanto, the Filipino food crate, but decided to try Nom Nom Nom instead. The guy who runs it is super friendly and upbeat. He provides wonderful customer service despite how busy is. He was moving around very quickly getting things done and I didn't feel I waited too long.  Unfortunately, I didn't much like the poutine. There was something different about the cheese curds, which to me are the biggest part of the experience. They were squeaky and tasted great but the texture was a little off, it was more like paneer. The gravy was decent and but the fries were perfection!  I'd come back and try something else. The crepes look lovely!"}
{"text":"He does not take shortcuts with his ingredients! Crispy fresh fries are made with red potatoes, and his cheese curds are homemade! With good amount of gravy but not too overbearing or salty. Its made fresh to order, so a bit of a wait time is expected if there's a line, but well worth it. Well deserving of  #1 poutine in Toronto award."}
{"text":"I've never had poutine until we came to Toronto! By far one of the best things I have ever eaten! I recommend the Merguez!"}
{"text":"Known for their poutine and crepes.  I wasn't feeling for crepes that day, so was looking at their poutines.  They have lots of options on their menu, but because of the purist that I am, I ordered the plain or regular poutine.  Portion was quite big!  The fries, cut in house, and fried fresh, topped with real squeaky cheese curds and gravy that wasn't overly salty.  Love their poutine.  Probably one of my faves in the city now."}
{"text":"I was surprised when i arrived here and the place was actually an adorable food truck, not far from Kensington Market. I ordered the traditional poutine. I had tried poutine for the first time in Montreal and was utterly disgusted. I wanted to give it another try though, and I'm glad that I did because this poutine was more than edible. Although the owner explained that his poutine was based from the traditional Montreal style since that's where poutine originated, I found his cheese, gravy, and fries to be more balanced. Good job!"}
{"text":"I never had poutine and after reading some Yelp and Google reviews I decided to go to nom nom nom! Not only is the name fun to say it'll make you say it while you eat the delicious poutine! I ordered the pulled pork poutine and the traditional. Both were absolutely amazing! The gravy made the cheese melt with some serious cheese pull and when it didn't it was still great! Pulled pork was on point as well! The gentleman that was working was incredibly nice and cheerful too! Absolutely amazing poutine! Will be back!"}
{"text":"As tourists in Canada Poutine is a must try! We stopped by at Nom Nom Nom Poutine yesterday evening and ordered a traditional and smoked meat poutines. SO delicious! The meat on the smoked meat poutine was tender and had a great flavor. From the fries to the gravy to the cheese curd toppings the poutine everything was absolutely awesome! The place is also located in a pretty cool area with picnic tables to eat on after ordering out. 2 of the poutines were more than enough for my boyfriend and I to share. We came later in the day towards closing time and got lucky enough to pull up right in front of the stand for parking. Would definitely recommend if you're in the Toronto area!"}
{"text":"NomNomNom Poutine is a poutinerie (I hope that's a word) that serves basic and suped up poutine near Alexandra Park. As the name suggestions, the hole in the wall is very Nom-able. Prices are fairly cheap for the amount of food you get. One of the better poutines I've had in Canada thus far, would come back!  The poutinerie operates in a shack along a bunch of other shacks.   Ordered:  Classic - Just fries, gravy, and curds - good balance of gravy so it's not too soggy, but the majority of fries had some sauce."}
{"text":"Mmmm nom nom nom. Definitely deserving of the praise.   I had the smoked meat poutine. Cheese curds that squeak. Some really damn good cheese curds.  Crispy fries Gravy that's rich but not too salty Unlike poutine from Smoke's, it didn't leave me feeling disgusted and nauseous. Just the right amount of salt and fat.   Conveniently located across the street from a hospital."}
{"text":"I considered myself not a huge fan of poutine before I came here and had no idea what to expect. As I walked up, the super friendly owner(?) took my order for a traditional poutine. He proceeded to dump a fresh batch of fries into the fryer and the waiting game began. Several minutes later, the fries were ready and served with cheese curds and gravy.   My friend mentioned to me from some time ago that poutine is best served piping hot and so piping hot it was.   I proceeded to have my first taste and it was awesome. The flavor and consistency of the gravy was just right. The fries were great too. I'm glad that this was my first real poutine experience.  Cost: 6.75 after HST  If you're an ambitious fellow, you can try eating two whole servings of traditional poutine for $10+HST. You only live once."}
{"text":"Love that the store was in a shipping container, so hip!   The serve various types of poutine, but I went with the most basic one, fries, cheese curds, and gravy. Loved that the fries were crispy, with a healthy amount of gravy spread everywhere without making it too soggy. This was the first time I've had poutine with cheese curds, which was fantastic. I like that you can easily control the amount of cheese in each bite to find the perfect mix. Cheese curd not too chewy and fairly flavorful without being too cheesy.  Good amount of poutine as a snack for one individual. Definitely the best traditional poutine I've had in Canada so far.   There was extra seating in the community center behind that was sheltered as well."}
