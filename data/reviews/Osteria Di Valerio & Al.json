{"text":"Alright, but very expensive for what you get. Pork was way over cooked, almost like rubber but the apps were good. I would go somewhere else and others in the party agreed."}
{"text":"Food and service are killer. The Bolognese will kick your teeth in. Been there many times over many years and the quality keeps improving."}
{"text":"Be prepared to possibly dine in speak-easy surroundings. I took my daughter and her co-worker to dinner mid-week during November while they were in town for a convention. The food was okay, not outstanding, the wait staff is great. My disappointment was Al, the owner, bent over backwards to please a party from the casino that consisted of 4 men and their two escorts. The public display was inappropriate for a public establishment - shouting of loud foul language teamed with cavorting that belonged in a private dining room.  We were uncomfortable with the situation. The dining environment  spoiled the experience."}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Service was very good but the food was blahhh. Under seasoned & very bland. Look elsewhere if you are going for italian"}
{"text":"The only thing preventing me from giving Osteria 5 stars was the price. The food is unbelievable. The flavors were perfect and the portion sizes were huge. If they knocked $5 off each plate it would contend for the best restaurant in Cleveland. The atmosphere is perfect and there is a Frank Sinatra cover singer on Friday nights. The seating area is in a small basement and is typical of an old school classy Italian restaurant. The seafood risotto was phenomal as were the pasta dishes. Again, if it wasn't quite so expensive I would go at least 1-2 times per month."}
{"text":"As someone who lives in the Warehouse District, I had heard some good things by others that this was one of the best places to eat in the area. My girlfriend and I were genuinely excited to go to Osteria. The result of our meal left much to be desired. For a Friday night, it was not that busy (4-5 tables, most of them done eating but drinking wine, and no one sitting at the bar). The place was very loud with constant piercing laughter and conversation. It was impossible to have a conversation at your own table without yelling just as hysterically as the others.  I felt like I was in a comedy club inside a small room. When we were seated it took our waiter 10 minutes to come back to us just to get our drink order. His excuse was that he was splitting checks for some other diners, which according to their menu they do not do anyways. Furthermore, one of the main reasons we came was because we were told that Osteria served gluten-free pasta for gluten allergies. Our waiter was not very accommodating with this and seemed confused or  less desirable to find out if that was indeed true. Later, he found out that the gf pasta was available. The food was okay, nothing amazing. With both of us being Italian with a rich food heritage, I'd like to think we'd understand the difference. My girlfriend got gluten free penne with bolognese and I got the orecchiette with tomato basil cream sauce and spicy sausage. Wine pours were good. That said, overall this place is vastly overpriced for the lack of attention to service and just acceptable not great food. I left disappointed with the money that I could have been spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in down town Cleveland.   Great food, great atmosphere"}
{"text":"I've even to this place two times, for my own birthday and then a friends birthday, both times got very disappointed with the way staff handles billing for parties. They decided to not give separate checks to people coz they were too lazy (I can say this coz on a previous occasion they did it for us but 2nd time refused it). So most people in the part ended up paying more than they actually ate, the waiters were rude, non accommodating. Food is very good but I would never recommend going there for big parties coz they will screw up your bill. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Osteria Di Valerio is a good Italian restaurant in the Warehouse District, although I can't say I was blown away by it. Most of the dining experience was very good, but there were a couple of things that knocked this review down to 4 stars. Going on a Monday night probably didn't help. Osteria is in a cool basement space on St. Clair. You have to go down a set of stairs, albeit a small set, to get into the dining room, which is kinda cool. We had a reservation and were seated right away. However, it took forever for our waiter to come, when there were only two other groups and a couple of people at the bar. Someone in my group went to get his attention and he came and apologized for the wait. He was very friendly and helpful. However, he was the only waiter working and not only was he the waiter, he was also the bartender. The restaurant should have had at least one other waiter or bartender, even though it was a Monday night. Service was smooth from there on out though. After we ordered, a complimentary basket of bread was served with a sun dried tomato butter as well as just normal butter. The bread was outstanding. It tasted really fresh. The sun dried tomato butter was also outstanding. It was so good that I had a slice even after the bread was cold and I was done eating my entree, and stuffed too. For an appetizer, I had the cream of asparagus soup with lobster and black truffle. The soup was good, but I got three small pieces of lobster in it. I was hoping for a more substantial serving of lobster in the soup. Out table also ordered the antipasti platter and the calamari. The calamari was great, as was everything on the antipasti platter, a collection of excellent meats, cheeses, and olives, as well as sun dried tomatoes and peppers. For my entree, I had the lobster ravioli, which was a special the night I was there. It was very good. I'm a sucker for seafood pastas and definitely enjoyed this dish. Overall, if you're looking for a good place to eat in the Warehouse District, consider Osteria. Most of the food was great, except for the skimpy cream of asparagus soup and the service was good, if a little slow to start off. At least our waiter was very friendly."}
{"text":"Went there this week for dinner while on a business trip, sat at the bar. very crowded,  some tables very noisy, but hey: as long as they're having fun. i started with the beef carpaccio and then had the veal tortellini. the carpaccio was awesome: sliced very thin and a nice touch adding some finely chopped onions and some parsley. the veal tortellini were good... not great. i was a little concerned about the service. several servers approached my while sitting at the bar, apparently unaware if i had already ordered or not. then when i wanted to ask for some parmesan cheese it took me like 10 minutes to get someones attention. the owner (or manager?) seemed more interested in providing superior service to the table of 8 rather than checking if the guy at the bar needs anything. all in all a good dinner, hope they will find a way around the service issues."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food,salad is very fresh, great veal cook just right, but the services is little slow for me!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood to eat Italian, downtown, authentic and this place fit the bill. Yes it's a pricier place, yet understood prior to going in.  Lamb shank was incredible along with chicken and other pasta dishes.  Wine was varied and was offered help and suggestions hit the mark.  Desert was very good.  Overall, above average, great service, fun place and recommended."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and terrific service!  Reggie was great!  Had the Beef Carpaccio and the Veal Scallopini   Melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant in Little Italy and knew he was opening one in the wharehouse district in Cleveland. To our surprise, we were blind squirrels finding our acorn. The restaurant and food are 5 star. The service is superb. The cocktails wer the best we ever had. Hard to beat this place for fun and celebration."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, and overall good restaurant with solid food, just steep on the price point.  Highlights include air-dried beef carpaccio (off-menu special, which I've only seen once--also the best dish I ever had here), regular beef carpaccio (okay, 3.5 star-worthy), and the lamb rack (4.5 stars). The last time I went, the lamb was cooked to perfection, soft with a perfect, slightly sweet balsamic sauce. I've never ordered pasta here which impressed me, but I've also never seen the raved-about lobster ravioli on the menu. Both the Muscovy duck + veal meat sauce and the ricotta + spinach ravioli were underwhelming for $20+ dishes.  Ambiance is nice, somewhat romantic, but gets really loud when many large parties are seated. Cannot comment on the wine menu as I don't drink, but it probably makes the food taste better.  Bottom line: for the amount of money you'll spend here, you might as well go a few blocks east to Lola for a truly fantastic foodie experience. I won't be coming back here unless I'm looking for a fast way to get rid of extra money."}
{"text":"Osteria provides a classy dinning experience and is a welcome alternative to the usual trendy but mediocre newcomers to the Cleveland restaurant scene. Don't be misled by the very modest entrance that descends a few steps down from St. Claire. Inside you will find white table clothes, an intimate but lively dining space, and an inviting bar. The staff is professional and very friendly, the menu offers a nice range of classic Italian dishes, and the food is outstanding. Pay close attention to the specials which are exceptional."}
{"text":"Went here with 5 brothers and their wives, we had a memorable experience. The chef made us what he though we would like and keep sending it out. Everything was delicious. Can't wait to be in the area again."}
{"text":"Ok. First thing you need to know is that this place can be pricey - one app, two entrees and two glasses of wine can run you upwards of $120 easily.  Second thing you need to know - every penny is worth it! I'm of the basic opinion that what a restaurant is truly selling you is food. And boy, does this place deliver.   Ordered the Mussels for an appetizer - you get a heaping plate of mussels in this tomato-wine sauce that is to die for. Perfect cooked mussels and a sauce that makes you wish you could put it into a jar to take it home.  This was followed up with a Penne alla Puttanesca and a daily special of a pasta with Lobster in a basil cream sauce . The puttanesca was simply amazing, with the perfect mix of capers and olives to add the zang to the sace - I find a lot of places try to make up for their cause by throwing in a bunch of capers.  And the basil cream sauce with lobster - *sigh*.... I'm literally drooling simply thinking about it!!!  This is a place you definitely need to go to if you appreciate good italian food and do not mind paying a bit to get some!"}
{"text":"Sigh...I was disappointed with this place (and I had really high hopes for it because it's a block and a half away from where I live, and we were looking for a closer restaurant option than always trekking to Little Italy).  I went off the board and asked if the check could make a bowl of Cavatelli with Arrabiatta sauce and grilled chicken.  The server assured me he could.  Well, the chicken was very dry, and the sauce was barely spicy.  I was bummed.  I thought the prices were high for the quality of the food.  We like La Dolce Vita in Little Italy (keep in mind their decor sucks but their food is good).  I think we will stick with La Dolce Vita in Little Italy, D'Agnese's in Broadview Heights, and we'll give Casa de Angelo a try in Macedonia."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Cleveland for many years. Love the Gorgonzola filet! Awesome. Often quiet on weekday night, which is nice for conversation. Most Clevelanders have never heard of this restaurant. They're missing one of the best."}
{"text":"went there this past Saturday and was treated like I grew up with the owner.......recommend the Torttolini w/ prociutto.....very nice....one in our party did not like their Gnocchi and it was quickly replaced with an order or Torttolini......  short walk to the new Casino where I got clipped for 50.00..........."}
{"text":"Took my first trip here on Friday night before a night out.  You might miss the place if you're not paying attention but do so at your own epicurean peril - this place is great!  We enjoyed a couple cocktails and the delicious sun-dried tomato butter with the table bread.  Instead of the typical course of an appetizer and two separate entrees, we opted to share two appetizers and one entree.  We had the scallop appetizer that was quite divine.  The other appetizer, a traditional beef carpaccio was good but the beef lacked some flavor that I was hoping for.  For the entree, we enjoyed the special halibut (which we were advised was delivered not more than four hours prior to our arrival) and it was spectacular.    The atmosphere was great for a date, dark, nice decor.  That night they had two entertainers singing Rat Pack favorites which made for a more festive environment.    Their wait staff seemed lean which is likely by design because the dining area seats perhaps 40 total, but they did a good job.  Also, they do not have a computer system for orders so they will not split checks although they accepted payment via multiple credit cards.  Check it out - A great place that is not to miss but is easy to overlook."}
{"text":"In short, extremely overpriced!  The menu offers 'primi' and 'secondi', (firsts and seconds) but they charge entree pricing ($25 -$40 each). By the time you eat your app and first (pasta), you have no room for a second (meats/seafood) not that you would want one because you'd be at $75 per person for food that's a notch above Olive Garden.  We ordered ravioli that was cold in parts without any fresh taste.  The second, veal Osso buco, which is braised with the expectation of tenderness, was so tough and bland.  I'm almost sure that that was not even veal.  Veal is always tender! At this point I was looking to at the least be pleased through a desert so I risked the $9 on a glorified piece of chocolate cake.  Unimpressive!  To boot the decor was as cheesy as the lounge singers and idiot patron stumbling/dancing in front of him."}
{"text":"Save your money and take it someplace in Little Italy. This place is pretty terrible. For the prices they are charging, they need to hire better service and do a severe overhaul of the interior which has become extremely dated. The service was pretty bad. The server presented us with the specials before our entire party even arrived, thus having to repeat the specials several times (and seemed annoyed by this). I felt we were rushed through our appetizer and dinner courses. When the dinner plates were cleared, some of our party were absent in the restroom or on the patio, and this is when the server decided to ask if we (the remaining 3 people) wanted dessert. HELLO? You might try asking a full table. Finally, the checks arrived, handwritten, because they could not figure out how to split off some of the checks. For anyone who has ever worked in this industry, this is an annoying, but NOT difficult task.    Now for the food. This place is supposed to be \"upscale.\" (Their words, not mine). The prices are upscale, the food is not. Of the food I sampled, I had the traditional caprese salad, the buffalo mozzarella salad special, ricotta and spinach ravioli with peas (which came dumped on the side, presentation was underwhelming), orecchiette with sausage, and the fish special (I think it was sea bass). None of which impressed me. All of which was your straightforward Italian fare, and definitely NOT worth what they were charging. I also had the gelato sampler which also came with sorbet. Very bizarre to have the fruity and fresh sorbet in the same dish as the creamy and rich gelato. Plus there was supposed to be pistachio in there, and there was none.  Finally, the atmosphere leaves much to be desired. It could be a very romantic place (basement level), but the decorating is straight out of the 80s, and there was a tacky Rat Pack couple serenading all during dinner. It's a small place, and this made it very difficult to have a conversation with anyone at my table. I found the music to be loud and intrusive.  Overall,  I guess it just drives me crazy when your typical Italian place can plop itself on West 6th and think that location means you can charge an arm and a leg for something nonna makes for sunday dinner!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian! This place rivals NYC's best without the noise and characters. The salad taste like they just picked the lettuce, pasta just the right texture, the sauces are tasty, but not over bearing. No garlic overload, they pile on the bread, the lamb is fantastic, Mahi Mahi was superb, the service is adequate"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Osteria years ago, and have had many good times there ... especially with Rick & Sharona are performing there! I love that you can order half orders of all the pasta (although they do not advertise this in any way) - because half orders are more than enough! AND you get to try more than one! I've also had great success with their chicken dishes and soups. They have a half dozen specials most nights in addition to the regular menu, which hasn't changed in the years I've been going. Also, the atmosphere is small and cozy, although I admit I prefer going in the fall/winter; being below street level, it's hard to convince oneself to go in on a beautiful summer night! I've found the staff to be \"okay\". Some are great, some are lack-luster or just seem uninformed on the food and wine they offer. More than a few times, the wine list has been woefully out of date - ordering several wines in a row that they just didn't carry anymore, and finally letting the bartender just pick one out - not ideal. I do have to commend their glass pour list though, which is accurate and has a good selection. While the food can be quite amazing (try to the veal tortellini or the orecchiette with sausage), there always seems to be a problem every time I've gone with a group. On the most recent trip, there were about 8 of us. Two had to send food back, including myself - and I think I've probably done that one other time in my life. In my case, I asked if they could make me the penne vodka, which is often a special but wasn't that night. I was told \"No Problem\" - which was great. However, what arrived was not. I had a plate of pasta with marinara sauce - red in color. I've had the penne vodka there a half dozen times and I know exactly how it looks and tastes, and this was not it (others agreed). When I asked the server about it, she told me it was correct. I had to press the issue and eventually she took it back and I waited for a new batch while everyone else ate their meal. Surprise, surprise, I got a true penne vodka when it came back the second time. It looked and tasted completely different. Two other guests at the table ordered the special lobster ravioli. When it arrived, one guest had large pieces of lobster on the plate. The other had NO lobster on the plate and her food was cold. She sent it back as well. It's unfortunate, because other than that, we had a nice time and enjoyed the atmosphere. My best advice is to go to Osteria on a cold dark night, enjoy some wine at the bar, and order a half portion of pasta."}
{"text":"Love this place especially on Thursday and Friday nights when Rick and Sharona perform. The food is exceptional. Try the Gorgonzola gnocchi and the lamb chops. Service is consistently good."}
{"text":"Overall a good place for Stinktown, U.S.A.  Authentic food. It was nice to get away from a corporate restaurant scene and actually sit at a restaurant that is owned by locals.  A high end restaurant that is."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good (i'd give it a 7/10) but it is really overpriced!  A friend and I each got a glass of wine, soup, and entree and the bill came out to $50 each!!  While I have no problem spending that much money on a meal, I don't think the food was nearly good enough to justify the prices.  If money is not an issue, I would certainly say Osteria is worth going to."}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived before our friends and we sat at the cozy bar.  The bartender and the couple sitting next to us were all very friendly, and when I told them that this was our first time here, they told me all about their favorite dishes.  So, needless to say, we were excited to get to our table and order.  The Antipasti special was Bresaola, prepared the traditional way with slivers of parmigiana, olive oil and some Arugula.  I've had it in Italy and loved it, but could never find it here (I did find a shop in NYC that imports it, but the one at Osteria was much better.)  So they hooked me right with the first dish!  I ordered the Fluke special, my wife ordered the Lobster Ravioli special, and our friends both ordered the Osso Bucco.  All the dishes were excellent, but the Osso Bucco was off the chart -- so tender, and simmering in such a flavorful sauce--wow!  Ok, so it was expensive, but I came in expecting to pay \"downtown\" prices.  The portions, drink pours, were good however, and I didn't feel like I was getting ripped off in any way.    But the vibe was so comfortable.  Classy Decor, friendly servers.  Friendly patrons.  There was no pretentious attitude.  The owner even comes around to the tables to check in with everyone.     None of that trendy restaurant snobbishness here!  Everyone feels welcome.  Oh, and the couple at the bar telling me about all of their favorite dishes:  It was Carl Monday and his wife.  Hmmm, now that I think about it, I hope he wasnt there to investigate me.  I did tell the bartender that \"Cuyahoga County\" was buying my drinks/dinner that night \"wink wink\".  (just kidding)"}
{"text":"Part of me doesn't mind at all that other people just don't get Osteria.   It just means those of us who do get to keep it to ourselves, and I'm all about that.   The beau and I dropped by for a late Friday night dinner and walked into a pack restaurant with live music (Rick and Sharona, again) and dancing! But not douchy club dancing--we're talking Frank Sinatra tunes and classy dancing. I seriously have not seen people having this much fun out in a while.   And once again, the food did not disappoint. We started with a caprese salad and the crostini misti, which were delicious as always. Then came out the hot sex on a plate, also known as the orecchiette pasta in a tomato basil cream sauce with Italian sausage. One bite and I wanted to roll around in the plate. Oh, and don't sleep on the ricotta and spinach ravioli with fresh peas and tomato basil sauce. Super fresh, light and just perfect all around.   We also asked the server for an easy drinking wine and she came back with a bottle that was quickly gone. So good.   Awesome vibe, atmosphere and food mixed with fantastic live Frank and dancing. How could you go wrong?"}
{"text":"First mistake....we agreed to a reservation in \"the back room.\"  Do not go into \"the back room.\"  We were led completely out of the restaurant, down a hallway, and around to a room adjacent to the kitchen. Absolutely no ambiance in \"the back room.\" The food wasn't bad. Actually the specials sounded exquisite, but were priced in the $30-$40 range. Wine list was extensive, but basic wine by the glass was $10 or $11. Caprese salad was average. Bread was fresh and warm, served with flavored butters. Tortellini and Penne Puttanesca were quite good, but eating this meal in a back room with no ambiance really ruined the whole experience.  Our server, and other waitstaff, were very friendly and helpful. But the drunk man seated at the table behind us didn't add anything positive to our experience.  This place could be better if they lowered prices and eliminated the back room."}
{"text":"really disappointing dinners. so way overpriced for what's coming out of the kitchen that it's just silly. I've been twice now since I live in the hood but I'll never be back. complete ripoff. Italian at its most absolute mediocre."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner, and it was pretty much perfect. Classic Italian and Italian-American dishes done well.  It had been awhile since I had eaten any really great Italian food, and as an Italian, I was dying for some. This hit the spot. We got beef carpaccio for an app, and it was incredible! Served with artichokes, lemon olive oil, capers, and strips of Parmigiano cheese, it was full of flavor. I could have eaten 3 of them. For entrees, I got one of the night's specials, the surf n turf: veal scallopine and lobster, and my bf got Osso Bucco. I've never had better veal in my life, and both dishes were absolutely delicious. We cleared our plates.  For dessert they gave me a complimentary tiramisu that was, again, the best I've ever had, and we also ordered a chocolate hazelnut cake that lastd about 5 minutes on the plate before we devoured it. This meal really hit the spot. We were both a little worried beforehand because we went on a night when they had a singer doing Rat Pack classics, but in such an intimate atmosphere the singer was really fun and did a great job. It didn't hurt that he sung me happy birthday, or that Cavs coach Mike Brown was one table over.   I won't hesitate to return, it was such a wonderful, romantic atmosphere with delectable food and expert service. This place doesn't get enough attention in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. For ambiance, its easily the best in the warehouse district.  Tucked away, dark, live Frank Sinatra music, and a cozy romantic date atmosphere you won't find anywhere else in this neighborhood.  My boyfriend and I shared the Buffalo Mozzarella w/prosciutto appetizer which was delicious.  For entrees we had the Ossobucco and the Duck pasta special. The Ossobucco was very good. The duck pasta was also good and they did not skimp at all on the duck, but nothing about it was unique- certainly not enough to be a $30 dish.  And thats the only gripe I have about this place, the food is good but lacks the complexity of flavor or creativity to justify the cost.  An app, two entrees and a (cheap) bottle of wine put us at around $150, which is just not what the food was worth.  If the atmosphere weren't so great, I would rate this as a 3 star. Take that for what its worth.  I won't be back often, but I am glad to know there is a cute, romantic little Italian place in my neighborhood for special nights."}
{"text":"Lovely italian place in downtown Cleveland in the Warehouse district.  It's walking distance from a few of the hotels.  There are only about twenty tables but you can call ahead at make reservations.  They have live music some nights.  Their asparagus and lobster soup is amazing.  The orchietti pasta dish was good but the sauce was a little watery.  My friends dine here very often and said this was unusual.  They said the orchietti is usually perfect and keeps them returning regularly.   Pasta dishes are about 20-30$ and portions are about medium in size.  There are lots close by with parking 8-10$ and valet as well for 8$.  Meters are free on the weekends but also difficult to catch one on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, pretty expensive for what you get. We got the crustini appetizer which was very good. I got the veal tortellini and it was tasty but pretty greasy sauce. I would have appreciated some bread. My boyfriend got the tenderloin and it was very well prepared."}
{"text":"Best phone call to a restaurant I've ever had. I know that may sound weird but when I called for a reservations on a busy night they weren't able to get us a table but they assured us they'd take care of us at the bar. Like everyone says the ambiance is quiet and yes it is small/in a basement. The bartender Nikki/Nicki (?) was great and kept the olives coming for my martini. We were very appreciative of that! The food is pretty darn good. We had the pork tenderloin and bolognese for dinner. Bolognese wasn't as great as I've had at other places-but a solid attempt. Pasta may have been a tad overdone. But I'm an al dente person. Oh and the smoked salmon we had for an app was really good. So overall a great experience. However, I'd recommend you bring your dollar dollar bills!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant with a Groupon and were pretty pleasantly surprised by how amazing the food was. I had a beef dish and my bf had clams. Both were outstanding and we'll be back soon. The setting is also very romantic for a date night."}
{"text":"One word describes our dining experience...AWESOME! Great food, great atmosphere, great service!"}
{"text":"For Cleveland this is probably one of the more expensive restaurants. Was in town for work and this was a recommended place by co workers and we stopped by here for dinner.   Overall it was a homely old school italian restaurant where the owner wanders around checking on his patrons and sits at a neighboring table holding court with his buddies and drinking wine. Ordered the grilled lamb rack and tried the duck, they were both very good, the lamb was cooked medium rare, tender, and not gamey. The balsamic reduction was a bit salty and heavy for my taste but it wasnt a deal breaker.   If you're in town this would be a good place to try."}
{"text":"In town for business went down to my favorite Italian restaurant of the last several years....grilled melon with prosciutto and a balsamic drizzle, endive salad with some crunchy warm bread, and a perfectly grilled fresh Bronzino stuffed with perfectly sautéed spinach,side of peas on ziti and red sauce.   Dinner with no alcohol, tax and tip was 78.00. But I ate like a healthy king. Listen people.....most restaurants are entirely underwhelming. This place just puts out great food. So for an extra 25.00 your meal is memorable."}
{"text":"Started with the calamari, had a caprese salad, tomato was lackluster but that's not a surprise given the time of year, but it was well constructed. I ended with a fish special of the night. Everything was very good, I was too full to order dessert.  My companions ordered Paparadelle (sic?) I tried it and it was excellent, and osso bucco, both these dishes were also very good."}
{"text":"So, we came in after blue point same day.  Had a lot of food and drink, wanted a taste of this place had great friend, and friend of friends tells us of this great Italian  eatery!  Well I wanted to try this place just because it's walk down, like of the street type place, old school, made me think old school Cleveland, well soon as we got down and in, it's small, like a basement, very nice, not uncle Vito type, but what you expect if you have funds, not bar type, any whoo, lots of great wine choices!  We had the 2 best c Glasses of wine!  They were pricy but completly  organic, and labeled exact!  Like I like chianti's, totally had the chicken, or rooster or whatever, to show the exact region those grapes come from, on the neck of the bottle,  great bartender!  So stop in or walk down in its great!"}
{"text":"Hands down- best Italian food I have ever had! I was visiting from Dallas and am so glad we stopped by Osteria. Be sure to get the fish! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"upon entering this restaurant, i thought, what are we getting into........the outside is VERY hard to spot. the sign is tiny, dark and not very visible, there are 2 guys, dressed in kitchen uniform, smoking.....either the cooks or dishwashers, i couldn't tell. it just seemed weird seeing them hanging out at the entrance, like they were thugs keeping an eye on who entered. after stepping down 3 steps to open a very large white dungeon-like door, you enter into a soprano's dream. a dark, basement, with dim lighting, some windows to one side, a tiny diningroom and a long bar. we were promptly greeted, taken to our table and seated. the few people inside were mostly businessmen, guido types. it just reminded of a godfather's retreat.  white walls, black lacquere trim & chairs. some tables are oddly placed up against a pilar in the diningroom, with the seats facing the wall...... we ordered cocktails & wine......i was informed that they only had enough maker's mark to make the one drink i ordered, then i would have to choose something else. after which i heard another patron ask for maker's mark be told they were out.  so, after looking over the large, heavy menus, we listened to the server announce the specials and then we placed our orders..........we decided on the large anti-pasta platter of proscuitto, olives, cheese, grilled eggplant, red peppers and salami. it was ok.......it would have been much better with a drizzle of olive oil and maybe a bit of balsamic vinegar.........at $25 i epected more. the highlight of the entire meal came next.....a delicious, creamy bowl of lobster bisque swirled with truffle oil and peppered with big chunks of lobster.....absolutely fantastic!!! delicious!!! i should have ordered 2 bowls of this soup for appetizer and dinner, it was that good. as for dinner the entrees were the lobster ravioli special with sage butter and lobster chunks.....good, but needed more sage as most of the few leaves were in the center of the plate burried under the lobster.......another entree was a porkloin wrapped in proscuitto with a wine sauce, served with peas and some pasta. it was good, but the tomato sauce coated pasta side just didn't pair well....it would have been better with a plainer pasta as the red sauce clashed with the pork sauce. the other two entrees were noodles with duck and bolognese sauce and a tortellini dish. both ok, nothing memorable........... we all passed on dessert, as we were very full, something that is a rarity in our circle of friends! so, in closing, the portions are large and filling, service adequate, food is very old school italian, but i was surprised as the prices of the food for what the food was. we have no problem paying top dollar for top dollar food....but this was average..... the menu prices range from $12-$25 for apps, $6-$15 for the salad/soup courses, pasta courses range from $19-$25 and entrees from $27-$40, most being in the $30 range......... go, try it, it is good, but i don't think it is that special and a little pricy for what you get. it was nice, for us, to try once."}
{"text":"ate their Thursday 4/12, great food good prices and live music it was awesome.  I am back in Cleveland 4/17 and already made reservations before the Springsteen concert."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here every chance we get! They oftentimes have living social deals that help curb the cost. I think we've used a voucher at least 3 times. The service is always great as well as the food. We've tried numerous dishes and haven't been disappointed yet! It seems that some of the complaints regarding Osteria are lack of service for large parties or noise control. It's a smaller space with people that want to enjoy themselves. We are laid back and like the atmosphere - it makes us feel like we're actually in a large city."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I have had in Cleveland. We started with the asparagus special, it was studded with cheese and wrapped in prosciutto, what more could you want?  The gnocchi pasta was excellent as well as the risotto. The cannoli were the best I have had in the states and had us reminiscing of bakeries in Italy. We ordered a bottle of wine and when the server told us they were out of that bottle, she suggested another similar label and told us she would only charge us for the price of the bottle we were out of. Excellent service and food, perfect for a date night or special occasion."}
{"text":"A little tricky to find down the corner from 6th and St. Clair but this is thee most fabulous Italian place downtown. Check website and find when A Swinging Affair is singing there and make a reservation for dinner and a show. Smaller , cozy, intimate , memorable."}
{"text":"Very nice discovery. A Manhattan feel to this Italian restaurant. A date night is a good match for this place. Great service combined with a diverse menu. Pasta dishes were tasty and plentiful. Wine list plentiful and reasonable. Not much not to like here."}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant in the city. I've tried just about everything and the consistency and quality of the preparation is outstanding. It doesn't look like much from the street but once inside the professional staff will take great care of you. The space is intimate and calm. Even though the staff are working hard they are efficient and don't appear rushed or flustered. They are obviously well trained. The selection of wine is very good, the menu is diverse, and we have never had a negative word to say. We love it, and Ghenty in the kitchen is a master."}
{"text":"Good food and a very good atmosphere, but ditch the Frank Sinatra act.. I would run from it, unless you are somehow into that type of thing... Really?"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite restaurants in Cleveland but last time we went we were insulted and treated rudely by the owner, Al.  We have dined here before and purchased a bottle of wine with dinner, but this was a special birthday and we had a special bottle from a Napa trip so we called ahead and asked if it was okay to bring and what was the corkage fee.  We were told by Mike, \"No problem, don't worry about the corkage\".  When we walked in, Al made a comment that he was insulted that we would bring California into his restaurant.  We didn't dwell on it and went on to enjoy our meal.  When the bill came with a $25 corkage fee, we were shocked.  I do not mind paying a fee at all but that was higher than I've ever seen, plus we were told \"don't worry about it\".  So I nicely inquired and the waiter brought Al over who said, \"Well what do you expect when you bring wine into my restaurant?  I have to make money!  Why don't you just bring your own steak and ask me to cook it?\"  We were horrified!  We will never return, nor will any of our friends that we have shared this experience with."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem...Loved it!  Intimate and fun & lively on a Friday night with the live music--Needed a 1/2 hour to read the wine list..."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite spots in Cleveland.  If I could go here every night, I would.  Unfortunately my wallet and scale wouldn't be too happy with me if I did.  I highly recommend this place.   It's a great place for a date or a girls night.  I normally go with my girlfriends, and we are never disappointed with our meals or the service.  The mussels are fabulous (the ones on the menu and the ones on special). I also love the veal and the gnocchi. Sometimes when I can't decide between the two, they'll give me the veal with a side of gnocchi.  The best of both worlds!"}
{"text":"Wow, I think this may be my first 5 star review!  From start to finish, I loved everything about this restaurant.  The service was top notch, the food was amazing and the decor is warm and romantic.  We arrived 15 minutes after our reservation time (parking problems) and we didn't get a bit of attitude.  Our table was waiting and our waiter was there immediately.  My compliments to our server, who recommended a great bottle of wine, within our price range and recited a list of specials that boggled the mind!    Two of us started with Insalantina della Casa, which was a non-overwhelming serving of mixed greens, tomato and aged balsamic and another tried the Carpaccio di Manzo, raw shaved sirloin with grilled artichokes, onions, Parmigiano Reggiano and I think capers.    Fresh from the oven bread arrived just before our entrees, which seems strange but I think it's their way of making sure you don't fill up on bread before the main course arrives.    I had the Tortellini de Vitello, which consisted of incredibly delicious veal tortellini a simple cream sauce, fresh peas and prosciutto.  Seriously, my mouth is watering just thinking about this meal.  I would normally eat about half of a plate this large but it was so good, I actually finished it and didn't even care that I felt like I was about to explode!    The others in my party had mushroom ravioli, spinach and cheese ravioli and grilled rack of lamb, in place of the Oso Bucco that he originally ordered but the restaurant had already run out of.  This was just one of the places where you didn't want the meal to end.  We ordered a second bottle of wine, coffee yes, even dessert...mixed gellato for some of us and mini canolli and fresh berries for me!     I would almost consider a trip back to Cleveland just to reenact this meal...no joke!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is....get the veal tortellini.   Great atmosphere with even better pasta. Can't wait to try every other dish on the menu!"}
{"text":"Loved the service, food and wine list!  When i tried to make a reservation I was only able to get the back room that is usually a private party. Since we were 7 with 2 children it was fine.  As usual the kids got the best service and this made our dining experience wonderful. The shrimp and lobster with cheese tortilinni was a table favorite.  Our only regret was sharing dessert with my grandson...he shared a strep throat with us, really!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this Underground establishment. My better half and I had a \"Living Social\" deal, so we figured we had nothing to lose.   We sat at the bar because the dining area was booked with reservations. Which was not a problem for us. Totally understandable for a Saturday night.   After taking out spots at the bar we were greeted with a wine list the size of a Bible. A little intimated we both opted for a Perioni (Beer) Since we were here to eat I figured the bartender would offer us a food menu.......wrong. I saw a menu sitting on the bar and grabbed it. We both looked it over before the bartender asked \"Oh are you two eating here?\" We both ordered. I ordered the gnocchi ($22). After a while..... It came out of the kitchen. I thought they gave me the children portion. Extremely smaller than I expected for the price. The taste was average at best. Very disappointed.   In conclusion: Cool atmosphere, unfriendly service and small portions considering the price."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, cozy atmosphere, great wine selection from the bar staff"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Steak, Italian, seafood, it's all good!  They treat you like family. Huge wine list. Ask to talk to Al.  He's a great guy with a thousand stories."}
{"text":"Recently visited with a small group of people and was underwhelmed by the menu options and the overall ambiance. The restaurant is more of a basement space, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's SO generic and bland looking. But hey, it goes with the taste of the food.   The pasta dish I had was pretty bland and definitely not worth the money. The menu offerings are limited, with just about everything having meat in it. There are only 1 or 2 entrees sans meat. Plus, the prices are bloated for what you get, especially since the food isn't that good.  We asked the waitress to split the check four ways and she said it would take too much time, so she split it equally between our party, which led to some paying $25-$30 more than what they ordered. Sorry, didn't mean to inconvenience you by asking you politely to do your job.  We definitely won't be back."}
