{"text":"Love this place. All of the staff are super friendly - they are great not just to regulars (like some places in the area) but to everyone who comes in.  Food is fresh, locally sourced and delicious.  Decent beer menu too.  To be honest, the service alone would be enough to bring me back! And they love dogs. Enough said."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant in the Cabbagetown, food was excellent as were the staff, chef who visited our table to say hi, and the atmosphere. We had beef carpaccio and the salmon with spinach and creamy potato salad, just great!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great atmosphere, great staff and realy close to our guesthouse! A must do when you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"When we got married we knew what kind of reception we wanted: good food, good vibes, good fun, and good drinking! Luckily for us we were sent to The Local Gest and immediately upon meeting with Gary and Chef Javier we knew it was the place for us. The menu was carefully crafted with our ideas and dietary preferences in mind, and we were thrilled with how delicious it all was. Egg and bacon with hollandaise, guacamole stuffed eggplant, gravlax salmon, potato pancakes...it was all amazing. 

Coordinating a party for 75 people could have been a real stress, and the staff of The Local Gest helped us to set up, time the itinerary, and have fun engaging with our guests. Everyone in the place really looked happy to be there, and that energy was exactly what we needed. They even set up the patio when the weather decided to be on our side! The layout of the restaurant allowed us to have dining space, quiet space for families, and a dance floor suitable for Abba dance circles and Backstreet Boy lip sync performances. 

As far as events go, this one was all we could have hoped for and more. The Local Gest really know how to make a party successful. Many thanks to Gary, Javi, Sean, Tiff, and all the staff."}
{"text":"Another amazing visit to the Local GEST. This is definitely a Cabbagetown institution!  The cocktails made by Gary were mind blowing. I dined on ajillo shrimp made by Chef Javier and they were skillfully executed and delicious. The service was attentive with genuine care. I highly recommend a visit to this \"local\""}
{"text":"Excellent food, clearly prepared with care.  The menu is thorough enough to satisfy almost everyone (between us, we tried one of their dinner-size salads (huge and filling!), one of their grilled sandwiches (well balanced, nicely crisped, and stuffed full of delicious cheese and pork), and one of their entrees (the chicken schnitzel, perfectly tender and well seasoned).  The patio feels very secluded even though it's right on Parliament--a great location for an afterwork drink or a weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"I just had brunch there. Great service and atmosphere. French toast was off the chain. Highly recommending this dining experience."}
{"text":"When my American friends and I were looking for a place to eat a Canadian Thanksgiving feast, we were happy to find The Local Gest. The beer selection here was wonderful. Our server, Matt, was happy to guide us in selecting adult beverages. He was also eager to take shots of whiskey with us, which we did not mind at all. The meal was worth the hour wait. The turkey was so delicious, and it was smothered in gravy. As the night wore on, we drank more beers as our dessert. We were lucky enough to meet the owner, Sean, towards the end of our night. He was incredibly kind, and encouraged us to lounge in the huge booth seats until we wanted to leave. My American friends and I would all recommend The Local Gest. However, we highly advise that you do not engage in a debate about American politics with an employee there. Despite that unpleasant conversation, we will not allow the ignorance of others to overshadow our wonderful experience at The Local Gest."}
{"text":"I was recently introduced to this restaurant through a private event and I loved it!  Everything was prearranged so I didn't get to order from their usual menu, but the various dishes that I got to try were delicious.  I am going to have to make another trip to try some more of their dishes.  The restaurant had a warm and comfortable atmosphere, perfect for any occasion.  I hope to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening. 

Atmosphere: very pubs vibe, dim lighting but not too dim. Large space can probably accommodate larger parties. Not too noisy, can have a conversation. 

Service: early in the night service was pretty attentive but as it got busier it got a little sluggish. Seemed like they could use one more server on the floor around 8pm.

Food: we had the shrimp wanton appetizer to start, the pasta of the day(squid and shrimp ravioli)  and the pork and pineapple sandwich.  the Appetizer was delish definitely recommend. It was deep fried though but the shrimp was juicy and breading not overwhelming. Could have used a bit more hot sauce.  The ravioli was pretty good though for the price a little disappointing. Because you could barely taste the seafood over the pesto.  the pulled pork pineapple sandwich was great. Really good combo, just the right amount of spice. We also had the chef's creation desert which was a chocolate tart (basically tasted like a brownie) and the key lime pie which was alright. 

Beer: small selection. The drink menu in general had a \"jack of a trades, master of none\" feel to it. 

Tl;dr good place to catch up with some friends. If you want the quality time to be the highlight of the night."}
{"text":"Local fresh food that is always amazing. Great selection of cocktails and craft beers. If you want service that will remember your name and favourites just to make you feel special these are the people. Generally an older crowd but I still love it here and I'm in my early 20s. Great place to catch some sports. 
The ONLY thing I can say is to spruce up the events more. Half price wine pours? Drink specials ? It would keep people coming back. Especially frequent visitors that would love to save a few dollars. (Heavy drinkers ha ha) 

*PS 
The po-boy sandwich is UNREAL best in town and for the price it is amazing value."}
{"text":"Had a birthday celebration here last night for 40 people and the service was exceptional,. The staff went out of their way to ensure that everything went smoothly and everyone enjoyed the food. Great place too, to hang out for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Waaaahoo! The Local Gest has been in my bookmarks for a while so when I owed a friend dinner, I decided to take this opportunity to try out the Local GEST. I went with the Beef Burrito in mind but when I got there, I decided that I really really wanted the Po Boy. So I made my friend get the Po Boy and I got the Beef Burrito. I would say the Beef Burrito was tasty (in a kitchen-sink way) but the Po Boy was better. They also allow for half fries and half salad which is great because I can never decide."}
{"text":"I come to The Local Gest pretty frequently, as I live in the area. Service is always good and prompt and never overbearing. They have daily specials for pasta, soup, mains, etc. My favourite staple dishes are the schnitzel, the cubano sandwich, and I've had a good pasta special, too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I went for dinner a few nights ago and it was wonderful. I ordered the chicken schnitzel which came with a warm garlic potato salad. It was super delicious and I would highly recommend ordering it. The service here was great as well--the servers were very friendly and attentive. All of their food comes from a farm in Sutton, so you can feel good about eating local. I really enjoyed my experience here and highly recommend giving it a try. I can't wait to eat here again soon!"}
{"text":"actually 3.5 stars. Cool place and super nice staff. I had the burger and it was pretty good but not great. Wife had the Cuban which was pretty good not great. The music was really amazing and the beer was good too. I want to come back because I think this place is really a  4 or 4.5 but on this day is was a 3.5."}
{"text":"I drool when I think of the sandwiches here.

Such an amazing little place. Great for big groups as there is ample comfy seating. The staff are always really friendly and helpful with the menu.

I've never had a bad meal here. Menu items appear to change with the seasons, which I love because it means the food is fresh and thoughtful.

Some of the other Cabbagetown pubs have become quite crowded, noisy and expensive. This is a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"A fine restaurant, fairly low key and comfortable. My 3-star rating reflects that it's a good, everyday kind of place, doesn't try to be spectacular.  Service very accommodating and prompt. We were a small group of 4 on a quiet Tuesday night.  They were more than willing to make substitutions/changes to the menu items.  A reasonable selection of wines by the glass and Pommies cider on tap (yay!). QUIET place, great for dinner conversation.  No chic or high style here, which probably helps keep the food affordable.  Mushroom pie was interesting, \"heavier\" than expected. Tasted my friend's fries - very delicious!  Prices very reasonable.  Would happily return."}
{"text":"The Local Gest might be considered a gastropub, as they have a bit of flair to their food offerings, but it's not fully-fledged hipster-certified either.

I had the pulled pork, pineapple panini. I went for the fries/salad split for sides, and that option was only a $1 upgrade I believe. The whole thing was about $15 which was pretty good value. Really nice taste on the pork, and I could tell it was properly slow-cooked. I don't like ham and pineapple pizza, but here the pineapple worked well. Fries were fresh cut, and a decent mixed green salad.

I recall someone else at our table wasn't quite as happy with their dish as I was with mine, but it was something different. The dessert we shared was quite good though.

I was there for their trivia night, which was well run, but only moderately attended. It could deserve more people, since it was good fun and along with the quality food. The service was very good as well.

According to their website, they try to source their produce locally. Very well priced too, as a most mains are right around the $15 range."}
{"text":"The live blues music every second Thursday night is absolutely awesome! Been twice - it was the same guy on guitar singing both times, but once accompanied by a guitar and fiddle player, the other time a different guy who played banjo. Both times fantastic- all very talented musicians. The food and service are excellent too, and good beers on tap. Get the shrimp po boy!"}
{"text":"This is a CHOICE spot. Great food. Great craft beer friendliness. Family friendly. Owners of the place  are all about being a part of your experience. One of our favorite spots in TO. HIGHLY recommend to folks looking for a new local. One complaint. They mis-spelled guest. :)"}
{"text":"Their food is so delicious and fresh. Not in a nice neighbourhood but it's worth the trip. Will be back again soon. Their pineapple pulled pork sandwich was amazing."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the owners pad their ratings on yelp. Because I had the chicken burrito tonight, and it was the worst burrito I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on a Sunday walk and decided to grab some lunch. Turned out to be a cool little spot with great food! Would definitely recommend to anyone in that neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Delicious! Excellent quality food and wine. I really enjoyed my meal here, it wasn't served in a rush it came out in good time and the care and preparation was evident. I had a mushroom pot pie and my boyfriend had the beet salad which had an amazing dressing. Everything was fresh, they have a tight menu which seems to have everything you might feel like having on any given day."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and the food was excellent.  As well, the environment is great for young children as they are very accommodating too children."}
{"text":"Excellent food with great prices. Best selection of local only beers in Toronto. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went here on a date a few weeks ago, ordered the po-boy wrap (with shrimp and haddock) and my date got the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich with side salads for each of us. Both were incredible! Very filling and delicious! The fish in the wrap was very fresh and had a crispy coating. The server was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and checked in with us just at the right times. I'd love to go back again, my mouth is watering just thinking about that food ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch here and must say I was for the most part impressed.
True to the name, the beer selection on tap is a mix of locally brewed options including their own house lager. 

Interior is really impressive what they've done with it, lots of wood including sweet chairs that lean back and leather booth benches along the sides. The place actually looks really nice given what I remember this place to be when it was Ben Wicks.

Food was a smaller menu to work with on my visit as it was brunch, but I went with the Local Burger with added bacon and cheese, with a side of fries. Everything tasted really fresh and I was satisfied.

My wife ordered the Chicken Club sandwich and on first impressions I was jealous. Its a very long breaded pieces of chicken thighs (if memory servers correct from the menu) on a bun which actually looked really good. But I stole a few bites and the chicken was lacking any real flavour and the bun was just really bready, for lack of a better word. Still what I'd consider to be at least a 3 star sandwich but looked better than it tasted.

All in all, I'm a fan of the place and am always glad to see new options like this opening in the neighbourhood, so we will be back."}
{"text":"Honestly when I first sat down here with my family I was sure this will be a little hidden gem and we're going to have a great brunch.
The waiterress was very friendly and helpful and got us sitted, got our drinks etc.
But then something happened, she took our order but probably missed 2 out of the four dishes. So 2 dishes came within 20 minutes or so but the other two took about an hour to arrive.
Now, I understand things happen and people forget things but even when she remembered about 40 minutes later she offered no apology or anything. Just said it will be arriving shortly.
Completely oblivious to our annoyance or just couldn't care less and worse than that she is the owner. LOL. Go figure!
It's a shame because the food was not bad."}
{"text":"Super cozy inside but has an awesome patio outside as well during the summer! 

I was blown away by the quality of the food! We got the grilled pork and pineapple sandwich with a salad on the side (which was really unique and tasty!) and the stuffed chicken chicken breast. Both were delicious and very reasonably priced! I definitely recommend this place for a nice casual meal. Our server was also super friendly so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch last Friday as we had the time!  Was very happy we did.  Had a chance to catch up with a couple of the owners, and am very impressed with what they continue to do with the place.  They've been operating a farm in Sutton ON. I believe they said, and are incorporating their own organic produce into their menu.  They are also doing a weekly Farmers Market which we'll need to stop by and visit next weekend.  If you are tired of some of the other markets selling produce from the Ontario Food Terminal, this is probably right for you.  Keep up the good work guys.  I'm a huge fan of your model.  I taste the difference and admire your creative, authentic establishment!"}
{"text":"First time I came to this place I was amazed with the food and service, everything was delicious and even the owners chatted with us.
This second time we went, we were there for brunch, there was only 5 tables at the restaurant and it took forever for our food to come.
My friend's steak was cold, my hamburger was ok, but my husbands Po something sandwich was Amazing, wowwwww, I should have asked for that one instead.
Yeap I will go back, to give them another chance to see if it was only this one time they took forever with food."}
{"text":"Although this place has your typical local bar vibe, it's definitely not your typical bar food.

I was in the area for a show at the Phoenix theatre and was brought here by the great reviews.

On a Monday evening, it was pretty empty. It's quite a large space and has separate bar and dining areas and although we only wanted food, we sat near the bar area to not feel alone in the place. 

The menu is large and I ended up choosing the  pulled pork sandwich and boy is the portion ever so huge. Its definitely enough for two people to share. They are VERY generous with their meat. This particular pulled pork sandwich had a twist and came with pineapple slices. I enjoy pineapple and enjoy it even more sandwiched between bread beside some saucy pork.

As for sides, you get the choice of salad, fries or mixed ( both). Do note that the mixed option will cost an extra dollar. I got mixed and learn of this on my bill. Would've been nice if the server had disclosed this when I ordered but it's $1, not a big deal. The overall sandwich and side cost $15 plus tax which is pretty expensive, but considering the portion size can feed two average appetites, it's a good deal."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night and it was pretty empty I grabbed a seat at the bar and met Max the bartender and told him I was just visiting NY. He was very nice even having the cook make me off the menu poutine fries, I also ordered the beef fajitas and a cider the food was amazing!! The service was great and all the locals sitting at the bar were friendly! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was charged $2 for an open food fee, I'm not from Canada so maybe this is standard but I thought it was a bit odd. Either way if I were to go to Toronto again, I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The Local Gest is an absolute gem of an eatery. A group of friends and I were in the area, and decided to give this unknown (to us) restaurant a try. From its cozy and homey environment to its friendly and welcoming staff, the Local Gest proved to be an amazing meal experience. The drink and food menu was absolutely fun and delicious with healthy options available. The food pricing was very fair, and the specials made choosing an entree tough (I'll be back for more). Our server (Tiffany) took the time to chat with us, and ultimately made our meal experience highly entertaining. I'd definitely recommend going to the Local Gest, as I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ok....Its my absolute favorite.... Everything there is just perfect for me...Its my spot! Love their daily special soups, Sandwiches...their drinks are awesome....both fresh and cocktails... Try the cranberry fizz! The seafood chowder is just mind-blowing...! Keep in mind that the portions are big but you'll love it. The owners are serving most of the time and they are beautiful people....!! The patio is a plus.....!Feels friendly and cozy in there! I work nearby so I end up having lunch every alternative day...I'm still not tired...neither bored!"}
{"text":"The perfect pub, where you're treated like family.  Meeting a friend? Date night? Watching the game? Excellent food and drink?  My Local has a solid tap selection, excellent locally-sourced menu, incredible friendly ownership and staff, and I'd argue it's the best, most welcoming pub in Toronto.  

The first time I came in here was at a friend's family event. The second time, one of the staff learned my name.  6 months later I came in for a third time and was welcomed by name by Gary, the same guy who is actually one of four owners.  I've called the place home ever since, and they've never let me down in 3 years.  Have a drink and stay for dinner.  A Cabbagetown institution."}
{"text":"This place has the trifecta.  Good food, great service, great atmosphere!  We were in Toronto for a month and this place kept popping up but we always opted for something else.  On our last night in town we decided to make the journey to the local gest and it was well worth it.  
Cozy European pub atmosphere, staff was super friendly and accommodating, let us take a 6top on a Friday night just because we wanted the couch (we were a party if 2).  Multiple staff (besides our waiter) came by and chatted with us throughout our meal and we even ended up in the middle of a joke between the table across from us and their waiter.  Casual, comfortable, stay as long as you want, unpretentious type of place.  We loved it.  My husband had the burger I had the pasta special that night which was carbonara.  Both were delicious. Cocktails were lovely, but we can't say enough about the staff and warm atmosphere on a dreary Toronto night.  We'll be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"One of my fave places in the city, let alone the neighbourhood. We stumbled on this place during the Cabbagetown Festival last year and have been going back ever since.

The staff are incredibly friendly and the atmosphere is great. That's what keeps us coming back.

Nice tap selection of local beers.  The food there is pretty solid too - my faves are the fish & chips and the schnitzel. Only thing I've had there so far that wasn't stellar were the burritos.  They're fine, just not as good as the other options. What I would also say is that if you're looking for standard \"pub\" food (like nachos, chicken wings, etc.) you won't find it here but trust me, you'll be more than fine with what they do have!"}
{"text":"What I noticed immediately when I walked into The Local Gest this morning for brunch was how this restaurant truly brought the community together. There were many familiar faces who knew the owners and we also met Sean who was wonderful. Great sense of humor and he also gave us the location in the city of where you can find their hot sauce Valentina! (It's a Mexican hot sauce that has a smokey touch - we were in love when we first tasted it) Our service was prompt, the food was delicious and we love the idea of eating local. 

My partner ordered the steak and eggs (what a portion they give!). It came with 3 eggs, 8 oz steak, potato pancake,fruit and toast. I ordered the the po-boy burrito with haddock and shrimp, there is some definite heat in that burrito and by the end of enjoying half of it, I was almost in tears. I also loved the option to have fries and salad as a side for an additional $1. Lovely spot, would love to stop by for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"These guys deserve to do a lot better than they are. The food is excellent and the servers were great but last night they were dead while a few other places up the road were hopping.   The unfortunate subterranean location (formerly Ben Wicks) worked well for a pub but doesn't for a resto. 

But if you go for the food, beer and wine and service and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Visit Cabbage Town and eat local at The Local Gest...

We wanted to see Cabbage town- which was really cool-and have some lunch. We happened into The Local Gest and found the service to be excellent and the Po Boy Sandwich to be delicious. The ice tea was pre-sweetened, which we learned was the norm in Toronto, so no fault there. We would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We stopped by because of the alluring appearance of the outside patio. Little did we know we were in for a treat. Their lunch specials are amazing. We got the duck salad, it was phenomenal, and we got the Mac and cheese with a side salad. It was amazing as well. The vibe of this place is great."}
{"text":"Really wasn't expecting much as I had a Groupon and I'm not a huge fan of \"canadian\" food but kudos to this place. 

Friendly service and locally grown ingredients really do add to the experience here. I usually assume that local grown means bland but you really consume real food! I should also mention that the portions are HUGE - two people could share a dish. 

We ordered the chicken schnitzel and beef burrito. Both really good although the beef burrito was the home run tonight. The beef was just so chunky and tender,  almost reminded me of pot roast. The chicken was good as well but I needed a sauce. The gravy is amazing. Homemade and spiced perfectly. 

When I'm back in the area,  I'd like to come back and try the fish and chips."}
{"text":"Wow. The food, ambiance, music, prices and workers are great here. As a group we tried the salmon cakes (my favorite), the veggie and goat cheese sandwich, and the chicken club. Everything was delicious and filling. The service was quick and kind. The chef even came to check on us. I loved the here and would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with a local neighborhood flavor. We really enjoyed our time there and met the chef. He's a fantastic \"cook\"!"}
{"text":"We had trouble choosing from a menu of tempting, interesting choices and decided on a pasta and a sandwich. Both were tasty and well prepared--the pasta was correctly al dente, and the asparagus in the goat cheese veggie sandwich was cooked to the right degree of tenderness. Their was a blip in the service, but not a serious one, and the space is not the most attractive one in town, but the low prices represent great value for food of this quality. We were impressed to find such high standards in a casual setting."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place. Awesome interior. Super relaxed place. A bit pricer but they say the food is local. And its pretty tasty. The service was good and I like how everything was presented with a napkin on a plate."}
{"text":"Went to The local GEST for lunch & enjoyed a spicy seafood chowder & a large artisan meat & cheese platter with marinated olives & grainy mustard & fried capers. My 1st charcuterie ever was excellent. So was the Soho Princess lychee cocktail (I had seconds, something I NEVER do). Hubby spilled my drink over the platter & the staff cheerfully mopped it up, replaced my drink & cheese at no charge. The staff are wonderful & friendly, informative & I loved the abstract prints & lamps decorating the below ground pub. This is a cozy ambience suitable for seasonal celebrations."}
{"text":"We had just arrived in Toronto on an extremely rainy day and this place was suggested. What a warm and friendly atmosphere! To top it off, we were just in time for the live music performance. The food was good, ambiance was amazing, prices were reasonable, and the service was exceptional. The Local Gest was a great find for cold, hungry American girls on a rainy day. I can't imagine how much better it is in warm weather. There's a courtyard where outside dining looks like it may be a nice option, on a summer day."}
