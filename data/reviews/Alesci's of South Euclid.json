{"text":"I love shopping at Alesci's.  As other reviewers have said, it's not fancy, but is a great source for Italian staples.  Prices at the deli/cheese counter are very good.  I enjoy the chicken parm sub, meatball sub, and grinder from the to-go counter.  And they have like 50 different types of dried pasta.  I've been shopping there for over 3 years and see the same folks working there every time.  A great place to have in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Amazing hot foods counter. Ive been eating the cavatelli and meatballs since I was old enough to walk. I also love the pizza subs. And the pizza dough is homemade and delicious."}
{"text":"Growing up in Mayfield Heights, my family went to Ferrara's often.  Well, I thought I would give Alesci's a try.  Today, was my second visit.  The food is good and the prices are decent; you can't beat pizza dough price!  However, the employees are not warm nor very freindly.  Being a family owned-Italian establishment, (I am Italian), I guess I expected more.  I will go back to Ferrara's where they are way nicer and friendlier."}
{"text":"I always like going into Alesci's grocery. They have a huge deli selection and a ton of olives available.  They also have some harder to find items that Heinens or Whole Foods don't carry.  The pasta selection is incredible as well.  Whenever I go, I pick up 4 or 5 premade pizza dough balls and freeze them.  The dough is just delicious.  Nice people wok here as well."}
{"text":"I grew up in Mayfield Hts and this is where my mom bought dough to make pizza and pepperoni bread.   I haven't been back in a decade or so and it hasn't changed a bit. And for once, no change is good! In Columbus there aren't any little family owned groceries, especially italian ones.   And honestly, best dough around!"}
{"text":"Go to place when making pizzas! Can get everything you need, including 2 pizza doughs for $1 (last time I was there it was 3 for that price, but still a great deal).  Friendly staff, and great prepared foods too!"}
{"text":"Very nice selection of meats and cheeses. Probably my second favorite Italian grocery in cuyahoga county after galluchi's."}
{"text":"Alesci's is sort of an instition for local Italians.   It's really just an Italian grocery store that also offers catering services. I'm not a fan of their catering or prepared foods, otherwise I'd tack on another star.   Very large deli selection with all of your typical dago fare. Lots of different meats, cheeses, sausages, peppers, and OLIVES!!!! (sorry, I got excited - I love olives!) Their bread is pretty good. I could probably eat a whole loaf of it in one sitting. They also sell dough for bread or pizza making purposes if you're not Italian enough / too lazy to make your own.   There is another location in Willowick that I go to more often. However, I'm not so sure that location offers catering services."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Worth the drive from wherever you are.    This is not a foo-foo, fancy-pants place.  You will not find $200 75-year old balsamic here, or fresh black truffles.  You will find an outstanding deli, great hot foods & sandwiches. The Veal Parm sub is awesome.  I would contend that they have the BEST Italian bread in the city (I know, them's fighting words).  Great pizza dough, 3/$1.  Reliable selection of Italian pantry items at good prices.  Great staff."}
{"text":"Very nice!!! Great selection of Italian food and I had dinner in the bag!!! Literally! Walked out with homemade pasta, sausage and sauce! Easy peazy!!!!"}
{"text":"When I visit this place it makes me want to cook like 1st drug bust scene in Goodfellas, like a mad man all cranked up!   I enjoy shopping here. It has such a family owned VIBE. The service very friendly, these employees care!   They have a very good deli with reasonable prices. Lots of olives and sausages.   The prepared foods are excellent, from the pizza, sandwiches, and hot food items, everything is prepared fresh.   The pizza dough is very good. it is rumored that several local pizza joints buy their dough from here. The frozen pastas are really good!   The also carry Aurora's Spaghetti sauce. I remember this as little kid. Great sauce you must try it.   Amore"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian deli/grocery stores EVER!!! The bread and grated Romano cheese is absolutely out of this world!!! My fiancee and I did eat an entire loaf of freshly baked bread in one sitting without even realizing what we were doing!! THe prices are very reasonable and they have fantastic pastries too!!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes when I return home I get on a huge Italian kick. Normally the thought is to head to little Italy for most, but really I first think of here. I really like their stuffed cabbage, their subs are awesome too. If they have 'um I like those little white nugget snacks that come in the yellow box. Can't seem to find them anywhere else. Every italian or pseudo italian I know comes here at one time or another, it's pretty obvious why. Just delicious. They have something they call it Sicilian Pizza, I know it as Margarita Pizza, whatever you call it's delicious too. You have to try it at least once or you're missin' out on a Cleveland gem."}
{"text":"My daughter loves the mini meatballs! The pizza dough is great and the deli has boar's head meats. It's a great little shop!"}
{"text":"just heard this location is shutting its doors as a retail store for good as of August 27th 2016 .. big loss to the community .. you cannot beat their pizza dough both in quality in price (3 bags for a dollar? .. wow!) .. their in-house shredded pizza cheese is a must for the perfect pie .. the antipasta salad from the deli is a great value & totally delicious .. will need to travel to the other location now for my Alesci's fix but this location & the people are gonna be missed"}
{"text":"Love Alesci's.  I can't believe I am disclosing this in a public forum, but guys, they sell pizza dough 3 bags for $1. Occasionally it's on sale 4 for $1. That is an excellent price for really good quality pizza dough. I tell you because I feel I owe it to you to know where you can get good product at a good price, but I also feel like I'm telling stories out of school. Don't everyone rush out at once -- I can't be responsible for a run on the market.  It freezes extremely well, too. The dough, I mean.  The hot foods and deli sections are also top-notch, but mostly I'm obsessed with the pizza dough."}
{"text":"A real Italian market with great hot food and deli counters. Great pricing too - if they didn't close at 6pm I'd give em 5 stars. Anything you expect from an Italian market you will find here!"}
{"text":"I don't live in Cleveland anymore, and let me tell you, you don't know what you have until you don't have it anymore.   Alesci's is still the best Italian deli/grocer I know of.  I think about it all the time (I subscribe to their mailing list, even though I'm thousands of miles away, just to see what I'm missing).    Their deli olives in bulk.. .so good.  I can't figure out what they put on them that makes them taste so much better than other delis and makes me crave them so much.  The way crackheads feel about rock, I feel about Alesci's olives.    I took for granted that grocers would stock a dozen or more types of olive oil; that I should be able to pop over to the store for some truffle oil or truffle salt; or that I could by decent cannolis wherever I'm doing the rest of my grocery shopping.  I live in a city of almost 1 million people yet I can't find this stuff at home! I find myself browsing Alesci's web site late at night, wondering how much it would cost to ship a few tins of oil..."}
{"text":"Almost missed this little meatball, good thing my BF knows his food. It's a small to medium sized Italian market so expect aisles of cheese, sauce, dough...Tried their meatball sub today ($4.45 on Mondays), gives you maybe a 6-8 inch bun with 4 balls which were generous in size and tasted like they were just made. The tomato sauce wasn't too thick or too thin, I could have just eaten the sauce like a soup actually. Haven't tried any other of the large variety of prepared foods they have to offer .(was flirting with that chicken parm but went home with the meatball...what can I say i'm monogamous). Prices were reasonable, has its own parking lot to boot."}
