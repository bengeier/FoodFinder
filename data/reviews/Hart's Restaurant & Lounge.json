{"text":"you can be the only person in the restaurant and you still wait an hour for your food. then once your food arrives you never see the waitress again. fish sandwich is good but not worth the wait and filthy place. go get some chinese."}
{"text":"Haven't been in the bar, but the restaurant serves excellent food. Nothing fancy, but extremely well prepared."}
{"text":"If your the type of person who turns to yelp for reviews then this isn't the place for you.  This place serves canned soda, burnt coffee, and the cheapest bar food you can find.  I ordered a hot roast beef sandwich where the mashed potatoes were instant and the meat was some kind of rubber based meat byproduct.  It kinda tasted like a microwave meal.  After eating it (I was starving) I got that feeling of anxiousness that means your going to be sick later.  The only reason this place is in business is because the regular clientele consists of senior citizens who are life long smokers and can't taste the food."}
