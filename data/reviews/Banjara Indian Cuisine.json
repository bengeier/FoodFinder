{"text":"As soon as you step inside, your first thought will likely be that there is no possible way this place was built to be an Indian restaurant. The entrance way is virtually non-existent, and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room. At the back, a long wooden bar--the type you'd feel comfortable seeing in a Boston Pizza--eclipses the view entirely. The bar is far too big, and completely takes away from the Indian experience, and the only d√©cor to be found is some dated Indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees. But trust me, it doesn't matter in the slightest. You likely won't even notice. Why? Because this place churns out some seriously outstanding Indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring Christie Pits Park.  Savoury and creamy butter chicken, seasoned and spiced chicken masala, bright and soft saffron rice; all of the items you'd expect to see on an Indian menu are here. I've been here a few times, and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share, especially if your experience with Indian food is limited. Ordering a few samosas (meat patties) and cauliflower pakoras (chickpea battered cauliflower), and some peas pulao (flavoured basmati rice), a bowl of chicken masala (chicken with yogourt and spices), a bowl of fish curry (masala spiced-salmon) and a plate of naan bread (Tandoori-fried bread) for example, allows you to try a lot of different things, and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 people.  Now, I don't want to just casually mention the naan bread like that. I'd be doing it a profound injustice. It is absolutely to-die-for beyond good. It is never made ahead of time; it's made right when you order it. It's soft, cooked perfectly, and has a slight charcoal flavour from being expertly cooked in the tandoor. I've stopped in before just to pick up a few pieces of naan and nothing else. If you're there, definitely order it.  Pleasantly enough, this place is never at a loss for staff. Any evening you decide to go, you're sure to be taken care of. One of the things--and I cant believe I'm saying this--is that this place may actually be overstaffed. I've gone there before and felt as if I may have been the server's only table, despite being a packed house. It's a true joy to experience.  I know I said that the ugly bar and awkward entrance-way don't matter, and they don't for me. But if you're after more than just amazing Indian food, like say, an authentic setting and traditionally dressed staff, then you may want to keep looking; you won't find that here. What you will find is skillfully cooked, delicious food served to you by exceptionally attentive, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Best indian flavours @ this side of the globe. Cool stuff also. And because they are super busy, it only can be fresh"}
{"text":"Great value for the platter deal, only attempt when really hungry.  There are a lot of dishes to try, would like to come back and get a regular dish."}
{"text":"I frequently order delivery from Banjara. The food is always tasty and the delivery staff friendly and pleasant. Sometimes the food takes longer than expected to deliver, but it's quite the trek through downtown which is understandable. I love the butter chicken and saag aloo especially."}
{"text":"Good take-out Indian at affordable prices.  Portions are generous, and food is not overly oily or salty, which I find to be the case at many Indian places.  They have plenty of veg selections, I love the okra dish.   It is a bit light on the spice, but perhaps I just haven't ordered the spicier dishes.  I also love the little container of rice pudding that you get with take-out meals."}
{"text":"Went for the $9.99 lunch buffet and thought it was super yummy!    The dishes were flavourful, sauces/curries were delicious, naan was fresh, coconut ice cream was the best!  I wish it were more spicy in general, but I guess they are catering towards a more general \"Canadian\" crowd.  The only thing missing was chicken biryani, but they had an egg fried rice instead.  Great price and yummy food -- I would definitely recommend Banjara."}
{"text":"A restaurant is known by its food and staff. I must say Banjara had a perfect score in both aspects. We were a group of 15 people. The staff (Akash) was really nice and a great host. Very courteous and polite. Food was amazing, especially paneer tikka. Also the prices are pretty reasonable, total value for money."}
{"text":"I like this place. The prices are fair, and the service is friendly. I wouldn't rate it as the best indian food I've had but I would return."}
{"text":"Banjara is simply the best.   I was introduced to this restaurant by friends about 5 years ago and I've been a regular ever since.   My favourite dish is the Paneer Makhani. It's one of the richest, creamiest Indian dishes I've ever eaten. I cannot stop ordering this dish; it's becoming a bit of a problem. It goes so well with a side order of rice or some naan bread (get the garlic naan - you shan't be disappointed).   Other favourite dishes include: - Mutter Paneer (a slight variation on the Paneer Makhani, only with peas!) - Saag Aloo (great combination of flavours in this dish) - Chicken Curry (the sauce in this dish is outstanding - this dish is a must-order) - Lamb Vindaloo (excellent, just excellent - get it spicy if you are up to the challenge)  If you like spicy food, you can ask them to custom make any dish with extra spice. Otherwise, the dishes will usually be quite mild.  One word of advice: only order take-out or delivery from here. They have seating at the restaurant but it's always packed and the service is disorganized and slow. Be prepared to wait up to 2 hours for delivery on Friday and Saturday evening during peak times (5pm-7pm)."}
{"text":"Food: B+ Service: A- Food presentation: B+ Atmosphere: A- Prices: A Recommended?:  Yes? ... and no  The aroma of indian cooking is probably the highlight of this place. Not much else to say about this place... pretty average. And you can't expect much from a buffet. Some of the items are great and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Bit of a hole in the wall place that looks like it used to be a 7-11 but the food was great and the prices more than reasonable. Particularly loved the veggie pakoras and the daal curry."}
{"text":"This is just one of those Indian restaurants you step into & you just KNOW it's going to be outstanding.  Shared the lamb Rogan Josh, Chicken Karahi & the Garlic Naan, which indeed is all \"stretchy & warm\" as a reviewer previously wrote.  Everything was incredibly delicious & loaded with spices & flavour. Some of the best Indian cuisine I've ever had. Service friendly & efficient. Ambiance casual, nothing fancy, perfect."}
{"text":"I choose this place based on all the other good reviews on yelp. I ordered delivery and I decided at 5pm what I wanted and when, so I placed the order at 5pm for delivery at 8pm. My food arrived by 9pm and was colder than I would have liked. The quality of the food itself is good, however I would not recommend ordering delivery from this place considering that they are not capable of delivering on time and hot food, however if you go to their restaurant I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went here for a friend's birthday a few weeks ago. I typically do not like Indian food, but was so stuffed and impressed by everything I ate! Not outrageously priced, and a huge variety of foods to choose from.  The place is packed, and I can see people having an issue with seating arrangements, but man. The food just trumps everything else. We shared four main dishes, two appetizers, and naan for the table. All delicious, and we even had left overs. The chickpea batter cauliflower was a nice surprise!  I will definitely be going back. But not to the place next to it, which just doesn't look as appetizing."}
{"text":"We always order from this place. I love the chicken. Saag and my partner loves and the somosas are yummy. A must try restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Bad service.  Food is a little more authentic than most indian restaurants downtown and full of spices but was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Best indian in downtown core.  But I should say we always do take-out -- inside is a little shabby/crowded."}
{"text":"I wanted to try out this place after all the rave reviews on yelp, but i was quite dissapointed with my experience.   The naan was good, the Karahi Beef wasnt quite what a \"karahi\" is traditionally meant to be, but was some sort of mild curry with overcooked green peppers and onions but was acceptable.   The seekh kebab was horrible though! very hard and thick and rubbery, hard to break into pieces and dry, could almost \"bounce it off the wall\" as my mother put it.  We told the server that the kebabs left much to be desired, and he was very nice about it and offered to make us a new batch or not charge for it.  I'm probably not going to go here again, even though the other dishes might be better than what i ordered."}
{"text":"Worst butter chicken I've had in my life. After reading so many good reviews, I ordered take out to treat myself on a Friday night. Well it turns out that it one of the worst experiences I've ever had with ordering food. The butter chicken was alright. Not at all sweet and buttery as butter chicken is supposed to be. The butter bread was stale and to top it off, there was a worm crawling on it!! Almost threw up at the sight of it. Cannot look at the rest of the food. This was my first and definitely will be the last time ordering food from this place."}
{"text":"We tried the malai kofta and beef madras. Both were pretty good. I found the malai kofta a bit tangier than I normally like (I prefer creamy and a bit sweet). However, I will definitely order from here again until I find my favourite dish on the menu. We ordered pick up but there were lots of servers attending to the sit-in guests, which I took as a good sign of a well-run restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are looking for no frills standard Indian cuisine that is good this is the place to go to. The prices are dead on and the dishes typically do not disappoint."}
{"text":"We have tried this place twice in a two years gap. First time didn't like it at all so after two years we decided to give it another try. The food is acceptable and you can make a combo dish to try different options. We have tried Palak paneer (not creamy and strong taste of fried onion), butter chicken  meets your basic expectation, chicken tandoori is tasty but a bit moist. Lamb madras was the best dish that we tried. Great combination of taste and texture.  Do not expect any sort of service in here (although the calling button system is good). There is no food presentation. Everything in our combo was mixed together. Our waitress poured the food on my friend and she did not care at all! With the price you pay, you can't expect much. I am not getting into the bugs and strong smell of the burnt oil inside. Try to get a table outside. Make sure to ask for your gulab jamun to be heated, otherwise you will be given a cold, stale piece. I might visit this place once more in two years again."}
{"text":"We love this place and always come back to it as our favourite Indian restaurant. It's clean, the service is professional and the food is delicious.   I also wanted to say that one time I left my purse on the back of the chair, and got downtown, realized I didn't have it, and called them. They told me not to worry, they'd kept it behind the counter for me. I picked it up late that night, even got there after closing. I appreciate that!!  The only thing that keeps it from five starts for me are: It's so close to traffic and the parking lot. Would be so nice to have a better view from the terrace. Also, we often have to wait... but that's also a good thing because so many people love it!   Good food, great place!"}
{"text":"This place was really good indian food. Cause lets face it....you go to most indian restaurants and you can find a host of familiar dishes....but for them to make it really good, thats whats important to me...not uniqueness.  We had, veggie pakoras, chicken korma, chicken saag, mutter paneer, rice and mango lassi.  Everything was really awesome. I love that you get to choose your spice level from mild to very hot. We got medium hot and were left with a pleasant spiciness in the back of our throats (not mouth numbing). The chicken korma was moist and flavourful, the mutter paneer had amazing texture and the sauce was so creamy and comforting and the saag chicken was less saucy than I am used to and you know what? I liked it better. The pakoras were standard. Mango lassi was awesome....thick and creamy and tart. YUM!  The service was quick and efficient although they did kinda stand there and stare at us throughout our meal which was disconcerting. Value is great. Everything came up to around 50$ and we were stuffed to the brim!"}
{"text":"Love the food - definitely my go to Indian restaurant in the city (West or East end).  Combo platters are a great way to experience what Banjara has to offer as you will get 3 curries to try.   Food is great! Service is sometimes inefficient but overall I always leave happy."}
{"text":"The service was quick and friendly.  The naan were fresh but a bit too doughy. I had a garlic naan which the garlic was just put on top whereas most restaurants I've been to put the garlic into the naan - I wasn't a fan of all the garlic being put onto the naan.  The butter chicken was a bit bland.  The deep flavours were missing from this butter chicken.  I also had an aloo prantha which was full of potatoes and crispy - probably the best part of my meal.  In my opinion, this place is worth the value but if you're looking for an authentic Indian restaurant this isn't it. For value I get a four star but for over authentic Indian cuisine I get a three star."}
{"text":"Best Indian food downtown Toronto in my opinion. It's delicious and it's a good value, compared to some of the other places in the city. Their butter chicken and madras chicken are amongst my favorites. I'd recommend getting the garlic naan with whatever your choice or meat or veggie dish. I also love that they have free parking, which is a big plus!"}
{"text":"I have been to a few indian places and they have always left me dissatisfied, most of the indian restaurants are namesake. By far Banjara has lived upto it's name and I left satisfied (all gaga about it). It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night and most of such places lack customer service but this place paid well attention to every single table, the service was quick enough and the server was very friendly and courteous. Also the owner, a very simple indian guy,  made sure everyone was doing good and checking the service which I loved the most. Would surely go back. And yes here's what we had:  Onion bhajiya, malai kofta, naan and also my bf ordered shrimp biryani which according to him was very good (I don't know much about non vegetarian food as I am a vegetarian)."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time. I think they've become complacent and the service really proves that. Their butter chicken is my favourite in the city."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Toronto! I am vegan and I really enjoyed the Bhendi Masala and the Chana Masala both veggie items that are also dairy free. Check it out if you're in the Cristie Pitts neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Banjara, and wow, it was SO good! I'm fussier than fussy and don't try new things to often, but this really surprised me, and I can't recommend it enough. I had the chicken tikka masala dinner. I picked it up, and didn't eat in the restaurant, so I can't comment on service, but the young lady I dealt with when picking up my order was friendly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"For the first time, about 6 years ago, my wife and I went to this location of Banjara and were simply blown away by the quality, affordability and the atmosphere of this place. Last week we decided to stop by for lunch and repeat the experience; this was a big mistake.   My wife ordered a butter chicken+ a plain rice dish and I ordered a sizzling lamb kebab with butter naan, we also ordered one mango lassi and one salty lassi+a simple cucumber salad and one mango chutney.  The butter chicken was way below ordinary, how can you make butter chicken taste so bland and monotonous is beyond me, my \"sizzling\" kebab arrived on a cast iron dish but it wasn't sizzling at all , and it had a weird and unpleasant taste about it. The salty lassi had a very sour tone to it, almost as if they mistakenly added lemon juice to the drink or even worst, as if the yogurt had gone way passed its expiry. The mango chutney tasted like a sweetened cardboard and again had no flavour whatsoever. This experience cost us 55.00 CDN+ tip. There are many many places all around this city that offer the same dish with much higher quality for a similar price if not cheaper...I'm hoping this review will wake up some decision makers at the restaurant to make a better quality food...it's a real shame, I'm never going back."}
{"text":"There`s not much more that I can want from a local Indian restaurant.  Top quality food consistently, decent atmosphere despite the quirkiness of the former donut shop, very attentive service.  Eat-in or take-out, quality is always excellent. Favs: shrimp makhani & the baingan bharta."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I was skeptical.  This place used to be a sketchy donut shop (Coffee Tip), and then a short lived burger place (Steak Queen).  Both substandard establishments that was not worth your time.  So when Banjara opened, I hoped for the best but prepared for the worst.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The combo platters ($13 for dinner) are an especially good deal when there are only two of you.  Ordering dishes on their a la carte menu is best when you're with a group since their portions are decent.  Delivery is slow and they screwed up my order on several occasions.  Better to pick it up yourself.  I suggest double checking your order before the delivery guy leaves or before leaving the restaurant, to ensure that everything you ordered is there."}
{"text":"Food is average. Usually find it completely booked and brimming with people. Anyone who has a culinary taste buds would not give a super high rating for the Indian food served here.  Can be tried once or go back to one more time. That should be sufficient I would say."}
{"text":"Wow - I ordered here based on great reviews, and was completely disappointed, and today I noticed, all the bad reviews, that would have helped steer me away, have been filtered out!!  Beware, and read the filtered ones, as they seem more on the nose.  Flavourless curries!"}
{"text":"Very good, reasonably priced food.  The owner is extremely gracious and accommodating with his customers."}
{"text":"I got a veggie combo for delivery as well as the samosa. I wouldn't say I am an expert at Indian food however I thought it was very good for fast take out. The delivery took about an hour however the man explained to me the reason why it was long because my other order was for butter chicken and that took long to cook. Orginally he said it was going to be 60 to90 minutes and I was going to cancel the order if it was going to be 90 minutes because would just be too long be he assured me he would only be 60 minutes and the delivery man did come in an hour. The veggie combo was about 12 dollars but it was a lot of food so it was soooo worth. Really delicious and so filling. I think the service was very good as well as the food, the only thing I didn't like was the delivery man. He was a bit rude. Overall it was good  I would defiantly order it again."}
{"text":"DE-LIC-IOUS!! As far as Indian food goes - this place is as good as it gets! Came here with a couple girlfriends and the food was top notch - we're all salivating thinking about the meal we had here.    We ordered: Aloo Gobi (Potato Cauliflower) Paneer Masala (Cheese Curry) Butter Chicken  Stuffed Cheese and Plain Naan Masala Chai  Again...drooling thinking about this place. I've had Indian Food in India and Banjara is authentic/great quality - service was really amazing as well.  If you want to know what India tastes like -visit Banjara :D"}
{"text":"First things first: the hours on this page are wrong. They are indeed open for lunch.  Butter chicken was a tremendous hit, as was the tikka masala. The Masala is different from other places I've eaten it at, especially because this dish felt more like a mix of a tandoori sizzler and tikka than it did the madras sauce style dishes I've had.  the Chicken Tikka itself had huge pieces of chicken. You won't be hungry.  Rice and naans were flavourful and the staff was excellent. Very helpful and kind and overall, a great experience. Great value for the money too."}
{"text":"Never actually dined in. We live super close so we always get it take out.. They are really nice. Food is ready really fast and the portions are plentyful. They always put in some samples of other items to try too.. Great place. Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"Very good Indian cuisine. Especially I like their goat in spinach and it tastes very fresh. The environment is good but the service could be better"}
{"text":"When this place opened about 4-5 years ago I LOVED it. Honestly, I was so happy that I could finally get decent Indian food in my hood'! I was seriously suffering from withdrawal after having moved back from the U.K. and could only find crap Indian.  Now, it's still good but I have to say it's gone downhill over the years. With popularity it has given way to smaller less tasty portions, crappier service, less meat in dishes than previous, etc. You know the drill.  On top of that, the place is always rammed so it's a waiting game. You 're best to get take away.  Now, the best thing about it that I discovered more recently, is that you can ask for them to use less oil in your dishes (because if you eat here you know the dishes are usually drowning in oil). I love the Lamb Rogan Josh, for example, without the oil. With the oil I gain 10 pounds just looking at it.   In brief, there are many great dishes here but they are not up to the quality they once were. Go here with high expectations that are slightly curbed, get take away to avoid the bad service and long wait, and ask for less oil in your dishes to avoid cardiac arrest!"}
{"text":"As far as yummy Indian food goes I'd have to say that this place definitely qualifies as a stellar option. It's always busy which is usually a clear indication that the food must be good. And it is yummy. I also love that there's a little pager button under the table to get the servers attention when you are ready to order your meal."}
{"text":"This place is a little bit on the pricey end but I HIGHLY recommend their full tandoori chicken - ask for it spicy, about $20 and delicious definitely a comfortable quantity for two"}
{"text":"Wow.. this place is so good for the cost! We always get the quick combo platters... there's so much food for 15$ (you could probably split it with someone) and quite good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for the lunch buffet. At $10 for lunch (up to 3pm), it's a decent deal. Depending on how busy it is, the refilling of the buffet platter may take some time to get refilled or it may go quick.  They have a solid variety of core meats (chicken/beef/lamb/fish). Then there's some Asian-ish stir fries mixed in there. The selection isn't huge (it's not Imperial buffet or Mandarin) but with what you get there, you'll fill up and not want to eat curry/Indian for some time, haha. FYI - probably worth going if you don't plan on doing any heavy thinking or activity afterwards cos, damn, you will be out of commission when you stuff yourself."}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  Our order arrived within five minutes of ordering.  Must try the lamb Roganjosh.  Also large vegetarian selection."}
{"text":"Banjara is our go to for Indian food in the area! There is a lot of choice when it comes to Indian Food in the area, but Banjara offers a great variety of indian food at reasonable prices. Some of our favourites are the fish pikoras, chicken korma, and garlic naan!"}
{"text":"Came here to see what all the rave was about.  I'm happy to say I was not disappointed.  Every morsel from the garlic naan to butter chicken, even the indian mixed pickles was amazing.  I'm now a firm believer of the theory that the dirtier the restaurant, the better the food."}
{"text":"I've only come here for the lunch buffet, but it was very good, and superior to many of the other Indian buffets I've tried in the city. The selection is good, they work to keep things stocked, and what more can you ask for at $9.99? The butter chicken is especially good; some of the best curry I've had. And the rice pudding is amazing. My wife and I went back for thirds and fourths.  I haven't had dinner here, so I can't speak for its quality, but by all means, go for the lunch buffet. For the price you just can't beat it.    The atmosphere is a little subdued, but gain, for the food and the price, not an issue for me."}
{"text":"Banjara is located conveniently just a stones throw from Christie pits and is one of the the best Indian restaurant in the city, not only because of it's incredibly authentic and masterfully cooked food, but because of its location and incredible efficiency and track record as a well run restaurant.  Aside from the perfect blend of spices and sauces that only a well trained Chef from India possesses, you can always expect your lamb to be tender and your butter chicken to practically melt in your mouth as you close your eyes and try to envision a better example of perfect Indian cuisine. Personally, I have a hard time putting it beneath any Indian cuisine I have had in my life.  As a restaurant, it abides by the old fashion sentiment that the customer is king and you can always count on a fast take out time and amazing service if you decide to dine in it's classically designed dining room.  This place is an absolute institution in Toronto because to find anything comparable you really need to go little India which isn't the most accessible area for people who live downtown but probably a little more accessible than going to India itself... Be prepared for an explosion of flavors and sensations if you eat here because they will not skimp on the spices unless you request differently."}
{"text":"After high anticipation, as suggested by a afriend and from reading all the reviews I tried this restaurant. I must say that the positive comments I have read about this place was always about the food. I should have noticed the lack of mention of service, because this was terrible!! Our waitress was constantly on her IPHONE and the restaurant had people waiting to be seated. She kept forgetting to bring us what we asked for, including utensils.  The hot dish, WAS HOT!! I am glad we only ordered the one dish as hot. I have to say there was not anything that stood out as extremely appetiziing whatsoever. I don't know if it was a bad day in general for the enitre staff. When we complained to the manager he apologized profusely and and then too $10 off our bill.  Nice touch thank s"}
{"text":"I haven't been for the lunch buffet, but the dinner at Banjara is pretty good! The prices for entrees are reasonable ($9.50 to $12.00). The chicken dishes were tasty, and there were complimentary Papadums.  Waiter was very polite, and the d√©cor is pretty decent. Considering the relative cheapness of the food, I appreciate the nice tableware and linens. Definitely not a bad spot for a 3rd date. Also have some huge tables for groups, so a good bet if you want Indian with your friends."}
{"text":"Wholesome and healthy.  I know they cook everything from scratch because I can taste the raw ingrediants in their dishes as opposed  to opening a masala packet and seasoning the veggies with that.   The waitresses are sweet and put you at ease as opposed to some high end restaurants where the waitresses have their noses up their asses."}
{"text":"First Indian restaurant in Toronto I've been to -  from the 'Sauga/Brampton area so there are loads of great choices and for all these years just never sought out Indian food when in Toronto. Read a BlogTO post that had Banjara in there, and thought ya know why not? It's right down the road from Eva's Chimneys which is a huge plus, so I decided to go here.  From the second I pulled in, and yes I pulled into this place because there is actual parking which is so f'n rare to have! Only about 4-6 spaces, but I went at 12pm and was lucky enough to snag a spot. Already was liking this place before opening their doors.  From the moment coming in the staff was super nice -  once sat down they served poppadom complementary. I love this, and miss it. IDK what it is, but I don't find enough places in the GTA serve poppadom to you before the meal. I'm from the NYC area originally, and I just recall almost every Indian place serving poppadom and with chutney too, before every meal. Indian places in the GTA should do this more please ;)  So everything was off to a good start, food came out quick and it was very tasty. Had 2 different panner dishes to try and another diner had a chicken sagg which they loved, some vegie pakoras too. Staff again was super nice, attentive, always came by to fill up water.   All in all if you are in Toronto and want to have Indian or better yet, go have Indian  THEN walk down the road to get Eva's right after this is the perfect place to go to. Do it, Banjara then Eva's it's a great combo."}
{"text":"Went here at least 3 times a moth got 10 years. I've moved now but the taste and quality of the food remains unmatched no matter where I look. It's absolutely the best Indian food I have eaten"}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone recommended this place as the food was INCREDIBLY bland. We asked for medium spice level, apparently this means add nothing, not even salt.   We had aloo golbi, channa masala and saffron rice.   1. Aloo golbi - 1 potato cut into fours - 4 pieces of cauliflower  Bland, over cooked vegetables (possible frozen cauliflower?). It was incredibly boring, as if I was just eating air, but soggy. How is it there was just one potato? Seriously? Also, the cauliflower was just disgusting. I felt upset that we paid for this.   2. Channa masala The chickpeas were cooked. Even though there were stewed tomatoes in the dish, I couldn't taste them, nothing was distinguishable, a tiny bit of spice and that was after half way eating the dish. So minimal it barely registered on my taste buds.   3. Saffron rice The portion was enough for two people, but it tasted like propane? I don't think this is what saffron tastes like.   Would NOT recommend to anyone.   Pros:  The only good thing is the restaurant was able to accommodate vegan/gluten free.  The food was not greasy.  Cons: Just be prepared to pay for bland sub-par food."}
{"text":"my first visit to banjara: the lovely servers are unbelievably attentive . we ordered the vegetable pekora which was heavy and largely inedible . but the butter chicken..oh the butter chicken!.... was delicious, as was the vegetable biryani. more than enough for two people. as we were about to pay for our dinner the manager came over to apologize for the  disappointing pekoras and removed them from bill.  very sweet. very classy. will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I have been to Banjara many times and it never disappoints.  By far the best Indian I have ever had. I've tried many dishes there and all were excellent, with the exception of one dish (a couple of months ago) that I decided to order \"hot\" thinking I could handle it - it was way too hot and not enjoyable, but not restaurant's fault.   Overall Banjara is exceptional value for money with authentic ingredients, a great atmosphere and very attentive staff."}
{"text":"I've come out of Yelp hibernation just to say something nice about this place - and yes everyone else here is right, the butter chicken is worth it :) also loving the beef vindaloo and the buttery naan. Service is fine, not intrusive and the place is fairly quiet and clean. Eating all I want for $10? Hellz to the yes.   Tip: inspect your glass, the first time I came here it was cloudy and didn't seem cleaned well. I just got another one, no worries! Also, after 2pm the naan starts getting rarer and rarer so come on over at lunchtime, you'll be fine."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought some Indian food the other night and it was so good we wanted to have some again the very next day. So I Yelped for another place in our neighbourhood to try and decided to try Banajara. We ordered the same exact dishes we had the previous night. Despite our appetites whet for our food to arrive, we were really disappointed at the difference in quality compared to the first place we ordered food from. It just wasn't the same. Big womp. I might try their lunch buffet for the price, but for what we paid for dinner I highly recommend Marigold instead. Same neighbourhood, same price range, big difference."}
{"text":"Banjara is my favourite Indian restaurant!! I've been to many Indian restaurants in Toronto, and Banjara is the best in terms of Indian dining.  Don't be fooled by their ugly exterior, this place is really good.   The staff there is very kind and provide great service. The menu is large and inexpensive which is great. The menu consists of appetizers, soups, salads, tandoori sizzlers, meat, seafood and vegetarian Indian delicacies, variety of rice and bread options, desserts and delicious beverages. They even have meat, veggie and seafood combo platters to choose from. Also, the food portions are fresh and bigger compared to any other Indian restaurant I've been to, and you get to choose your level of spice for each dish.   I've tried plenty dishes from Banjara and I've never been disappointed with any of them.Their naan bread is hot and fresh, stretchy and heavenly! Also, I tried dishes that I would never imagine ordering. Knowing that they do a great job, I got the guts and ordered those dishes anyway and was blown away as to how good they were!   The clean and comfortable atmosphere, the satisfying portions, attentive staff and most delicious Indian food/desserts always has me coming back for more! I highly recommend Banjara!"}
{"text":"I usually order the Tandoori Fish (Salmon) when I go to Banjara.  I really like the dish, but the portion is smaller than it use to be. The food tastes good and is cooked with a lot of oil.  The dining is quiet enough to enjoy company and your meal."}
{"text":"Best indian food ever!  If you like chicken dishes almost all of their chicken dishes have white breast meat.  The food is just amazing.  The staff are quick and efficient.  Nothing bad to say. The decor is not fancy,  but the food makes up for it.  For a casual night out its great."}
{"text":"I really an enjoy the food here and I want to continue loving it. But I ordered a chicken curry last night and found 3 long hairs in it and that has me concerned about the sanitary conditions of the kitchen."}
{"text":"BEST INIDIAN FOOD IN THE CITY. Take-out and eat-in are both delicious (but I don't do the buffet, no idea what that is like). No chemicals (MSG) like at other Indian restaurants. I wish, wish, wish they made Saag Paneer!!!   Note, the decor is not pretty, nothing to look at, but the food is AMAZING."}
{"text":"Tastiest Indian \"lunch buffet\" in Toronto, @ a sub $10 pricetag. Also LLBO approved.   Plz don't expect typical Indian spiciness, here things are much mild so that all ethic people can enjoy the \"taste of India\" in a milder form ;-)  Nice people serving you. Love this place."}
{"text":"This place is our go to for comfort butter chicken.  Whenever my husband or I have a bad day, we suggest Banjara butter chicken. Their serving size is just perfect for us to share. The service is always quick and efficient and the food quality is always consistent.  One of our top choice in the city for butter chicken! Yum-yum"}
{"text":"A good standby. Simple Indian but tasty. Our usual when we don't want to trek to Little India"}
{"text":"Oh my god!! How are they getting so many good reviews. My experience was pathetic. I know what Indian food tastes like and Banjara's food did not taste indian at all. 2 stars for the polite staff."}
{"text":"Went to Banjara for a friends going away tonight. Had always wondered about this no thrills looking establishment right next to Christie Pits. However appearances can always be deceiving. Definately was tasty. Having a table of 11 definately helps as everyone ordered one dish and then passed it around. Definately order some rice and Naan to fill out the dinner. I have to say no dish disappointed and service was excellent. They have a nice patio outside which might have been the better deal as the inside was alittle hot but not unbearable. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The buffet is blend without any character.  I am amazed why so many people like this place.  The food has no taste.  Buffet was missing NAN continuously.  Tandoori chicken has no spice.  Compare to Dhaba in downtown this place is not good."}
{"text":"I haven't yet had the opportunity to eat in at this place but we got take out once after a long day of moving, and it was fan-tastic. And the folks organizing the pick up food were pleasant and speedy. I look forward to a chance to eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nothing that hasn't been said before, but I could eat here all the time (delivery please!). Palak paneer, aloo gobi, chicken korma, chicken tikka masala, and a few orders of roti do it everytime, with plenty of leftovers for the next day, which are just as tasty."}
{"text":"Over 2 hours since I've ordered and am still waiting for my food. The worst delivery I've ever experienced"}
{"text":"Amazing place, went there tonight for the first time and it was amazing got the dinner plate with rice, chick peas and cauliflower and butter chicken. AMAZING!!!!!!!."}
{"text":"I was scared to try Indian at first but thank god i did. The butter chicken from banjara is by far one of my all time favourite meals. It's so rich a delicious and the nan is always so fresh and airy that you almost don't even need rice. Try the butter chicken and thank me later. You cannot go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Evrything is perfect except garlic naan. It is as same as butter naan. Service and food is perfect"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the city but delivery sucks. The website says 60-90 minutes but constantly is over 2 hours. I am less than 5kms away. This happens repeatedly and does not matter if there is traffic or not. On top of that the driver has an attitude and once asked me to come down to pick up the food. Unacceptable. As much as I like their food I will not order from there again."}
{"text":"Tasty food and good service. Friendly staff as well, they look very happy to serve as you say."}
{"text":"Our go-to place. We always order from here and are never disappointed. :) The chicken Korma and any of the hotter lamb dishes are sooo yummy."}
{"text":"Best chicken korma ever! Me n hubby even stopped eating butter chicken. I highly, highly recommend it, it's an easy addiction.love it!!!"}
{"text":"The food is very good - tasty, large portions, very broad choice of dishes. Staff is nice, helpful and quick. The only thing what I don't like is the place itself - I wish it would be more cosy and nicer designed, furnished."}
{"text":"Seriously one of Toronto's best places to get Indian food. Great attentive service. The food is always so tasty. And I can never finish the huge portions (I get to save it for later!)  They got a sheltered outdoor patio now and that is probably the best thing to happen to this small restaurant. Absolutely love the expanded seated area."}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to try Banjara for the first time on Valentine's Day of 2015. After an amazing experience, this is now our \"go-to\" Indian place.   Unfortunately we once experienced bad service where we waited 45 minutes to get our appetizer only to realize they had lost our order and it never made it to the kitchen. They gave us 20% off our meal and were very apologetic. We decided to give the restaurant another chance after this and have experienced nothing but great service- must have just been an off day.   I have tried many Indian restaurants in Toronto and this is definitely one of my favourites. The food is always good, hot, and fresh. The Malai Kofta here is the best I have ever had with a sauce so decadent and so delicious that just the thought makes me drool. I would list this as one of the most delicious sauces I have ever had. Every time we have ordered this dish we lick our plates clean. Seriously!  Other dishes we have tried here are the Chicken Samosas which were very good and not overly spicy (we can't handle much spice), the Pakora- I wish were more crispy- most times we have ordered it, it is  fairly doughy on the outside when you are expecting a crisp bite. We have also ordered the Navratan Korma, the Chicken Korma, the Butter Chicken and the Mutter Paneer. All dishes have been very good, however, the Malai Kofta takes the cake. Please order this next time you visit! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"2 words: combo platter. Why do other Indian places lack this on their menu?! It comes with your choice of meat, as well as dahl, aloo gobi, naan, vegetable pakoras, rice, and rice pudding, for $12.95-$13.95 depending on what meat you choose. I had the chicken korma which was cooked perfectly and had great flavour. Before the platter I started off with the complimentary papadums as well as a mango lassi, which was thick, creamy, and not too sweet. All of the food was great, with great service too. Other diners' plates looked equally delicious as mine and I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Banjara is a signficantly better than most Indian Restaurants.  Food is delicious, for both eat in and take out.  Owner has been around for decades and really knows his stuff.  I've picked up orders and taken them to work for lunch with co-workers and its always a hit.  I'd say this is my favourite Indian place in TO with Lahore Tikka house being my #1 for Pakistani.  Summer has a patio which is always busy and is a great place to be.  Nice to stroll around Christie Pitts after the meal to walk off some of the naan."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this place for a good while.  My dreams were satisfied, last night!  Had a great, quiet dinner on the patio, nice cold beer, attentive service and delicious food.  I had the chicken combo plate (I chose butter chicken for my dish), which came with amazingly fluffy & delicious rice, the cauliflower & potato dish, some crunchy tastiness and rice pudding.  And a perfectly-sized naan.  For $13.99, looked like it was less during the lunch sitting.    The food was all fresh and delicious, with generous portions.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Honestly, I live across the street from this restaurant, and there is nothing better than smelling Ban Jara welcoming me home at the end of the day. Their recipes are all great- I haven't ever been disappointed in the MANY times I've ordered takeaway / visited.  Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing value indian food!   Ordered the combo platter for 1 (13.99) for take out, came with daal, aloo ghobi, rice, naan, pakoras and I chose butter chicken as my main. Portion was HUGE!  So great to have a bit of everything without spending a fortune, especially for one person.  Everything tasted fresh and was delicious!  Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"August 1, 2015 update: They have sadly discontinued their lunch buffet.    Their $9.99 lunch buffet is great!  Yes, it's not as spicy as some people might expect, but the flavours are good, there is plenty of choices for vegetarians and carnivores (and there is actually plenty of meat in the curries), the mango salad is delicious, and their rice pudding is AMAZING.   The decor is a little tired, but the location is great, the waitress was friendly, food at the buffet replenished regularly.   Easy choice for a quick and delicious lunch."}
{"text":"May the gods help you if you try this place. You are gonna get soooooooo fat.   We go there for takeout, so I can't comment on the service, but...  Unbelievable mattar paneer. Ridiculous butter chicken (so says meat-eating husband). I don't think I actually deserve naan that good. Takeout is amazing. Just don't look the next day when you take your leftover second half out of the fridge and the top is solid. That's called flavour, my friends.  So good. Enjoy."}
{"text":"We tried two veg, two chicken and one lamb curry and they were all excellent. Worth waiting in line for.   Their system of having a call bell under the table, though unusual, made ordering fast and the servers were polite and efficient."}
{"text":"Yeah spicy is spicy.  I thought I could take spicy and then we ordered spicy.  Had to order a raita just to calm the waters.    Overall, everything we ordered was good:    -Onion bhajias were perfectly round veggie patties instead of the expected exploded fritters but still good. -Butter chicken, chicken tikka masala were as expected.   -Shrimp dopiaza was a miss.  We all agreed it smelled and tasted too fishy.  Although the shrimp was huge, the scent was too kooky for us to enjoy the dish.    Lots and lots of selection, you'll definitely find something you like."}
{"text":"This is the default Indian restaurant I go to when I'm in Toronto.  And not just because it's close to where I stay.  Walking to this establishment, you can smell the delicious cooking from blocks away.  The neighbors must go out of their mind.  Everything I've tried on the menu was delicious and reasonably priced.  Everything from the Chicken Vindaloo to the Matter Paneer.   One notable thing on the menu is their quick combo platters, especially if you're stopping in for lunch.  You get this HUGE plate full of rice, meal, salad, and dessert from 8 - 10 bucks.  For a little lunch item, I wind up bagging the leftovers for dinner."}
{"text":"Is an amazing Indian food restaurant in your neighbourhood a reason for you not to move? Maybe if it is as good as Banjara, but I ended up moving anyways. Living close to Banjara is great because take-out is your best option for enjoying this food. You get a larger portion and you don't have to wait for a table since it is sometimes busy. Eating-in isn't a grand experience anyways because not much has changed in this place since it was a Coffee Tip (yes, Tip not Time). The only cool thing about eating-in is sitting by the kitchen and getting a glimpse of the tandoor flames and the chefs cooking.  Having had most things on the menu, I would suggest skipping the appetizers. The Samosas and Pakoras are nothing special. Also, they are not great for take-out. Curries are the best in my opinion - I love any of the Kormas, Chicken Saag, and Mushroom Curry. You can't order without a side chewy, buttery Naan. I would also suggest the Rice Pudding which is spiced with saffron and cardamom (sometimes sneak it into your take-out for free)."}
{"text":"This place would have received a much better rating from me if the service had been the least bit better. My partner and a friend ate here last night.  There were about 5-6 young girls working the floor, watching tables like hawks and making it feel all around uncomfortable.  They snatched up out plates and glasses the second we had finished and were not apologetic after forgetting my friends meal.  Instead they acted as if it was just coming later but it obviously wasn't as we had to ask about it.  The food was good.  It was rich and flavourful, the naan was a good size as well as the rice dishes.  The lamb dish I has was tender and delicious, the butter chicken my partner had was good, the chunks of chicken were a little too big, and the paneer dish our friend had was delicious but tasted different from normal (she has had it many times before), maybe because they had forgot it and had to throw it together quickly.   What makes me give them a 2 star rating is at the end of the meal we were actually told to leave because there were tables waiting.  We had been there an hour and a half, not extraordinarily long, and there was a table of 4 2 tables over that had been there longer and were not asked to leave.  This is the best way to loose business and not get tipped.  Any good restaurant that wants return customers does not do this.   I will not be going back to dine here, maybe get take out. This place needs to train their staff and get real servers that respect customers and don't kick your customers out."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! I don't usually go to the restaurant for a sit down meal, but I get take out here all the time. The portions are massive and I eat leftovers for days! My favourite dishes are the butter chicken (ask for it spicy!!!) and the baingan bharta (eggplant curry - it was recommended to me by one of the staff there and it does not disappoint!)"}
{"text":"Let me start by stating that most items on the menu are good..the chicken biryani is a must have! The service is another story altogether - it's below par and don't even get me started on their delivery standards. As an extremely regular customer both dining/ordering in, they could really use some training in the customer service department. Plastic bits found in food, meat in their veg dishes and late delivery times do not mean a thing to the staff - all you get is a shrug or some smug response. Oh btw one of their delivery guys questioned me regarding my tip and how he drove a bazillion kms to get to me on a cold cold night (5km to be exact and we're in Canada..the cold, really?!) I based it on the horrible service I received that night  what with staff in the background contemplating the distance and minimum delivery charges (which changes in accordance to who you get on the line). Why did u agree to come out this 'far' 2 years ago when I first started ordering in? All I can say is go for the food ... and only the food!"}
{"text":"I'm so confused. I love Banjara and I was so excited to have a Sunday night feast on some of my favourite curries. Unfortunately what I received tonight was a bunch of mystery meats that crunched or remained unchewable despite my considerable efforts. The beef was half fat cubes and the chicken was.... not yet identified. This was not normal for this restaurant. Normally it's awesome, totally and completely. I can't explain this occurrence but to say I'm so disappointed and felt I had to express my dismay with food I won't even put back in my fridge to eat as leftovers.   I guess I'm saying Banjara is usually amazing but tonight's food left me scratching me head and walking the streets for something else to fill my stomach."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant when it used to be on Yonge St.  I thought it had closed and was so sad - but later found it on Bloor!  The food is fantastic - real chicken (not the bitlets), great sauces, the variety and prices can't be beat.  And for those downtowner's with a car, there is parking.    Although it has lost the cute family touch, the servers are still really nice."}
{"text":"Very good food. For vegetarians, I will recommend Malai Kofta.   Great customer service. All servers are very nice. Although, if busy you may have to wait outside.  Will certainly recommend if looking for good Indian food."}
{"text":"Shrimp Pakora is awesome here.  Went on Friday night with friends as a celebration, and the service was great -- food was even better.  You will always have lunch the next day. The portions are fair for the price!"}
{"text":"Went to Banjara after reading the reviews.   I'm Indian and I was somewhat disappointed. The food was average. I expected better considering it had been ranked best in Toronto. I guess people's perception of good food varies.  In any event, the breads (naans, poori's, roti's) were excellent. I did not recognize the Chicken Tikka Masala and when I asked a waitress she had to confirm it was Chicken Tikka Masala by asking another waiter. It was not chicken tikka masala as the world knows it but it was good. Chicken Korma was bland with no flavor. Service was good and the prices were fair.  I would eat there again if it were convenient but would not look to go there specifically."}
{"text":"Great butter chicken.  One of few places that can really make it hot.  I know it's not supposed to be.. but I like it.  Aloo Gobi (potatoes & cauliflowers) are also very good (comforting), and nann is outstanding.  Price, overall, is very fair for the quality of food.  Meat samosas were filled with minced chicken, which I will have to say were not very good.  Loss of star there..  Service was prompt and very friendly."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place.  The first time I went, I ordered the Veggie Combo Dinner with Navratan Korma. They asked me what kind of spicy I want - mild, medium or really spicy - and in the spirit of being an Indian, I said to make it really spicy. But, there is a level of spiciness where a dish stops tasting good and starts merely tasting spicy, and unfortunately the korma crossed that level.  However, the second time I visited the place, I ordered the same combo with Palak Paneer and asked for medium spicy, and it was perfect. I really enjoyed all the items in the combo. The portions were huge too, so that's a plus.  So, ask for medium spicy and you will have a good time here."}
{"text":"Banjara is a staple in this neighbourhood. Best indian in Toronto? Perhaps. I usually get take out to avoid the long wait in the restaurant but I have eaten in once. Service was fine, but I'll stick to take out for convenience sake. They do have a parking lot which is convenient though, with additional street parking available on Crawford.  I always order a combination of butter chicken, shrimp vindaloo, chicken tikka, and garlic rice with roti and naan. Everything is always fantastic - except for the complimentary rice pudding that comes with our take out. Nice touch though."}
{"text":"I love their location on Bloor and assumed this place would be no different. We rolled up on Sunday for lunch not realizing this place does buffet on weekends. We were a little hesitant about having the buffet as we all seemed to want something specific but ended up going for it as we were all going to die if we didn't eat soon.  The selection was the usual Indian buffet spread but way less hearty. The meat dishes were so sparse and seemed to have only a few chunks of the good stuff (meat) swimming about, and the flavours were so mild, as though things had been watered down. At least now we know for next time.  The place was practically empty but service was really attentive. Other than that, not much else to report."}
{"text":"WOW! This place was REALLY GOOD!!!  I've passed by this spot a million times going in/out/through Koreatown and while it's been many things over the years, I believe Banjara has been in this spot for some time now and is probably there to stay.   I was in the mood for some good Indian and my only experience with the place was at some send-off party for a colleague a while back where some of the food was catered by Banjara, though I could not say what was and what wasn't. We were trying to figure out where to take our mama to eat when my brother suggested we try Banjara as he'd heard that their butter chicken was good. I had to Yelp it to see what others were saying and it seemed to be a go, so off we went (the time of day was also a factor since it was rush-hour).   The first good sign was that the parking lot was full (not a problem at all, just park on Crawford, its cross-street). There is a lot of seating on their patio, though I did not care to sit outside in the humidity. I was actually expecting a dumpy place with good food, but when you step into the patio area to enter the restaurant, the setup/condition isn't bad at all. I was pleasantly surprised; it wasn't dingy and the staff were all really nice and friendly--which, those factors + good food are really what matter more than fancy decor and a pretentious crowd anyway. The crowd was a mixed bag and the place started to fill up pretty quickly once 6pm rolled around. There was also constant foot traffic of those doing take-out and I can totally see why. The smells emanating from the kitchen were quite noticeable but in a good way. I was ready to eat after a few sniffs of what promised to be nothing but goodness.  As our mom is still new to Indian food, we ordered the safe items while munching on the papadums they lay on our table. The dishes we ordered are ones that can more or less be found among the many possibilities at the standard Indian buffet:  - butter chicken: very tasty, just the right balance of spice and creaminess; contained juicy pieces of tandoori chicken - paneer: the soft chunks of cheese were dee-lish and the sauce dense with spinach - chicken biryani: wonderfully spiced with chunks of dark meat - beef vindaloo: my bro commented that it would probably be better with lamb or goat (neither of which am I a fan) which is probably quite true. We opted for the third degree of their four-pepper scale and it was actually extremely mild. We like our spice but weren't sure what the others could handle though we thought 3 / 4 would still be living on the edge. It wasn't, and it was just 'alright': soft pieces of stewed brisket meat was plentiful though... - (plain) naan: REALLY GOOD, fluffy and full of flavour, though the very bottom piece was a little oilier than I like as it seemed to be soaking up the grease from the top layers but hey, a little grease is forgiveable! I liked that it didn't turn into floorboard once it cooled, the way it does at some places--maybe the stiffness-when-cooled trait comes from sloppily overcrisping (ie, burning) it? - mango lassi: I've never had such a thick mango lassi and it was more mango than anything else which is NOT a complaint. It was the perfect accompaniment to a hot day and full of mango flavour. I liked that it was more mango than yoghurt!! * my mom had also ordered a soup to start which she enjoyed. It appeared to be a scalding hot bowl with a tomato-y base with some mild curry and some chunks of veggies--I could make out tomato, sugar snap peas, and carrots. I should have tried some but it was too hot of a day for soup.  Of all the dishes, I'd say the vindaloo was our least fave although it was still decent. Were it not for the coriander, I doubt the mild-ness would have carried this dish on its own but I guess that's what we get for ordering 3 chili-level heat. Lesson learned.  The only real drawback was the washroom, which was pretty gross. Someone had left a mass of something or other in the women's toilet so that it could not be used or flushed, let alone stepping foot in there. If the washrooms were decent, I think that 5th star would have been earned but anyhow if you can hold it in 'til you get home, this place is definitely worth a visit if you've got a hankering for some good Indian food!!  I can't say anything about the prices of individual dishes since I never looked at the menu but it was mentioned that the prices are typical for Indian food. I think our total was something like $70 (no alcohol; pre-tax and tip) and we all left pretty full. We tried to walk some of it off in the park but settled on some benches instead. For whatever reason, I thought Banjara might be a tad cheaper than other Indian restos but anyway, it's totally worth it. If you know you're getting decent food, you should expect to cough up at least what the others are charging."}
{"text":"The food is good but I don't understand why you would pay 10.99 for a lamb curry and not get rice included with your meal. Paying for a rice  when it should be included is crazy."}
{"text":"Ordered butter chicken, chicken masala, garlic naan and plain rice to my home. Butter chicken was good, the others were ok, however, I was fairly disappointed when it took over 2HOURS for delivery of the food."}
{"text":"Dont even bother with other places on Eglinton, go here. Best India food in the city! I was overjoyed when they opened a 2nd location near me, and every day is a struggle to not get a dinner combo takeout. Its criminal how empty this place usually is. Friendly service, good atmosphere, healthy portions, reasonable prices"}
{"text":"We had the Butter Chicken dinner and the Rogan Josh Beef dinner. Reasonable prices and quality. Pleasant and timely service."}
{"text":"While I had some expectations for this place, I'm disappointed.  It's fresh, well prepared, but the spices aren't working.  Got the Lamb Vindalloo (spicy), the Chana Masala (spicy), Saffron Rice, Bhajis, Garlic Naan.    The Bhajis are more like flat Pakoras, and their accompanying white sauce is not very good while I often find Tamarind sauce with Bhajis being excellent.  Best Bhajis I know are Canbe Foods.    The Garlic Naan seems like a Naan with garlic as an afterthought.  And the garlic is yellow for some reason.  Best Garlic Naan I know of is in-house ordered at New Haandi on Gerrard.    Saffron Pulao is pretty much nondescript.    Lamb Vindaloo was ordered spicy, and is acceptable.  Some medicinal nasal flavours in there, and it's not pleasant.  This is not a strong Heng application.    Butter Chicken is the gateway to Indian food for muzungus.  I make better Makhni Sauce at home than most restaurants.    Chana Masala was also ordered spicy.  It's a bit dry for a CM.  Also medicinal.  Found a chili that I popped into my mouth, and it tasted burnt.    It is very hard to find a brilliant Indian meal in this town."}
{"text":"Just finished having dinner there and I have to say I was really impressed. I had the chicken tikka sizzler with a whole wheat roti bread and some Raita as well as a soup for my starter. The food had so much flavour it was not heavy on the stomach but filling at the same time !! Definitely will go back :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food! This is our go to for Indian in the city. Good dine in atmosphere and even better take out/delivery. We live at high park and bloor and order delivery almost once a week - incredible delivery portion sizes and delicious food.   My girlfriend is also gluten free and had never had a problem eating any of their dishes. Highly recommend the palak paneer and lamb korma!"}
{"text":"Food is inconsistent in taste and in general more hot than other places. Roti was not fully cooked. Server was very unhelpful or didn't know what she was talking about when asked about different options. Recommended us to order a spicy butter chicken to taste the spices. The dish was too hot to be consumed.  Very mediocre food and restaurant. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Positive: Delivery prompt Servings HUGE Quality ingredients  NEGATIVE Rice PEAS PULAO was FILLED with onions. Couldn't really enjoy it. It was that packed with onion. Mateer Paneer no tomato and cream taste that I am used to with this dish, but could ALSO taste strong onion flavours in it.  Overall I would give this place another go. I would however change my rice dish, and would also forgo getting my fav Mateer Paneer Indian dish, as they did not live up to other Indian I have had in the city.   $46 tip included for two meals with vege samosas."}
{"text":"I have not attended the lunch buffet for this restaurant, so can't comment on that (although generally don't think a buffet showcases the best of a restaurant anyways!). The \"a la carte\" items, however, are great. It is a huge menu -  lots of choices, both in meats and vegetarian options. I have eaten in once, and take out a few times. The food is delicious, you can choose your heat level. The portions are generous (especially compared to what I have experienced at other Indian restaurants).   I don't recall all of the items I have had, but a few that stood out: veggie samosas, baingan bharta (eggplant dish), naan bread, butter chicken, tandoori salmon.  service: very friendly, attentive decor: leaves something to be desired....the only reason I took off a star. take out: love that they use re-usable containers!  you get credit for bringing them back to the restaurant as well. delivery: yes, from justeat.ca"}
{"text":"Don't let the humble former Coffee Time exterior fool you; This is one of the most consistently excellent Northern Indian kitchens in the city.  While you won't find an innovative approach to anything - nor much in the way of anything remotely resembling \"lighter\" options, you will leave extremely satisfied with enough left over to impress even a reformed power-eater such as myself.   Superior ingredients, dependably superb execution of one of the broader selections of Indian comfort food available in the GTA combined with FAST DELIVERY make this spot a winner."}
{"text":"My dining companion brought me here proclaiming that it was among the best Indian food he's ever had. Though I had high hopes coming in, I'm happy to say they were met and even exceeded.  The restaurant was fairly empty (Saturday lunch), so the service was prompt and attentive. The sweet lassi was deliciously tart and refreshing.   I had the butter chicken combo. Everything on that plate, from the exquisitely seasoned dal to the delightful rice pudding and, of course, the divine butter chicken was perfect. My friend ordered the paneer makhani. They mistakenly brought him palak paneer, and quickly remedied their error by bringing both dishes, and a free side of pakora. Two meals and an appetizer for the price of one...not bad. Both of his dishes as well were phenomenal.  All in all a fantastic experience, and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the city!"}
{"text":"They rush you here. Get'em in, get'em out. Not relaxing. Pressure from staff. \"Need the machine?\" Food was fine. Still overcooked papadams. Will not return. Too many other Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"People always say whichever Indian restaurant they frequent is the best,  but everyone I've taken to Banjara converts. It really is amazing hence the extraordinary crowd and take-out back log all weekend.  Just go, don't expect to be wowed by the decor, it's all about the good food.   Lamb Roganjosh is the best we've had. Takeout is never disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a really good Indian spot in Toronto. The food was absolutely delicious. We ate bhindi and mutton rogan josh, and the food was very delicious and prepared well.   Our server was exceptional. I like the fact that they're high tech, and take your order on iPods. The atmosphere is great, very clean, I love the solarium. And the prices are well worth the value received."}
{"text":"Our fridge has been broken for the past week, so it's been a great excuse for eating out and ordering in -- all week long (yesssssss).  Banjara is an oldie but a goodie, a place that you order from when you've had a bad day, or when you just need something familiar.  We ordered the butter chicken, saag paneer, naan and veggie pakoras for delivery (we were super relieved to hear that their delivery zone covers Liberty Village). It was enough food to render us completely useless for the rest of the evening and serve as our lunch the following day (in case you're wondering about the whole fridge thing, we kept the leftovers in the wine fridge for the night).  If you're eating in, then order the mixed plate with a bunch of different curries. It's a great way to sample a bunch of things."}
{"text":"Banjara became one of our favourites in the neighbourhood for both dine in and take out. (never tried buffet though) Quick service, delicious food, reasonable price.  At our first dinner in Banjara I tried vegetarian platter (sweet deal - $10 with naan and rice). You can pick one veggie item, the rest is fixed. To my surprise, vegetable mix I picked was average, but the rest was really good.  During multiple visits we tried chicken madras, spinach lamb, butter chicken, tandoori chicken tikka, baingan bharta... and more, but these are absolute favourites.  Portions are huge! So if two of you are starving and are going to order a whole portion of something then split one rice and one naan for side. Typically I split one dish+rice for dinner and lunch for next day.  Someone commented  that food is salty... but Indian dishes are meant to be eaten with rice or naan, they are traditionally saltier than western food.  Attention: be careful with level of hotness. When they say 'hot' they mean it. I saw once steam coming out from my boyfriend's ears after he got a hot korma (and he eats chili paste like jam).  I'll be coming back and will be ordering more for takeout."}
{"text":"I've been ordering take out from here for the past 5 years. The restaurant itself isn't the most aesthetically pleasing, but they have the best butter chicken in the city, hands down. I'm very particular with my butter chicken, but Banjara uses all white chicken breast and create the richest, creamiest sauce you'll ever taste. Also highly recommend their garlic rice."}
{"text":"The food quality is great. Their naans are superb. If you look for ambiance, forget about this place."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here, so this review only applies to that (i.e. I know nothing about service, seating, etc)  Food was fine, nothing noteworthy.   You want a butter chicken?  It's a butter chicken.  You want a naan?  It's a naan.  Food was slightly bland overall for indian food but fine (we asked for everything \"medium\", so maybe \"hot\" is better).  I would eat here again, but it's not a priority."}
{"text":"Solidly good dining experience with pros and cons to it.  Dinner menu is reasonably priced with sharable entrees, which is nice. We were 3. We ordered the Tandoori Fish (salmon), Malak Paneer and Butter chicken.  -The fish was nicely cooked albeit a little overdone as it came on a fajita-like sizzling platter. It looked delish but a little dry and tasted salty. It came with a lot though and was good value.  -The Paneer was nice and had basically the same sauce as the butter chicken.  -The butter chicken was a little dry. The sauce was good and had flavour and spice but I felt spice wasn't balanced enough in either dish (we ordered hot). The thing is, it mostly just tasted tomatoey and peppery which isn't -really- a bad thing but I like my butter chickens to come through really sweet and nutty at the same time.  -My friend got the salty lassi, and it tasted good, but was so small for the price!  -Similar feeling for the dessert we ordered - and I loved the Rasmalai (it's like sweet curdled milk balls) but it was 4.50 for only two pieces.  The service was kinda varied. There is a funny ring-bell you need to push. Our main waitress was friendly and attentive but most others seemed indifferent and didn't speak really.  -Our rice never arrived so we had to ring to ask, and it came shortly after.  -My friend was irritated with the woman who came to clean the table because she was taking away plates without asking, when my friend wasn't done with them.  -Also that particular waitress waited around for my friend to finish which was a little awkward.  SO! overall it's good, but I have another favourite in the area, so a MAYBE for return visit."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food restaurant so far. Love their du filled seating. Good service. My favorite is their Lamb Mandras. Usually a nan and a meat dish is more than enough for a person."}
{"text":"In the mood for butter chicken, we headed to Banjara.  The restaurant seems strangely stand-alone but busy with people. If you are driving, there's a small parking lot in the front...how odd! Something convenient for drivers on Bloor! Also, they have a patio if you want a nice breeze while you consume spicy food.  I read some of the other comments about the place lacking in decor... They serve food on real plates - not the silver \"prison chic\" metal ones... and they have cloth napkins.  I've been to many other more basic Indian restaurants.  The service here is quite good! Friendly and prompt.  The mango lassi was tasty!  More mango and less yogurty than expected. Super thick and served with a skinny straw. Try not to rupture a lung slurping all that mango goodness.  The vegetable pakoras were lightly battered, crispy and tasty. Much larger quantity than expected.  The butter chicken was wonderful with large chunks of chicken in a thick, creamy sauce. We asked for medium hot but they gave us non-Indian medium hot which equals mild. :(  Palak paneer was heavy but very good.  We already had a tomato based item so this veggie dish was a perfect compliment.  We ordered the garlic naan and the aloo kulcha. I preferred the garlic naan.... not just because garlic is awesome, but the aloo kulcha was a bit soggier and less potato-stuffed than expected.  The prices are fair and the portions are large. Between two big eaters we had enough leftovers for another meal for sure.  Great place with great food!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Indian eateries in Sri Lanka and India everything about it. The interior is painted yellow and red and is playing instrumental Indian music.   The waiters are friendly and has knowledge of the food in the menu. When ever you want to order any thing or call a waiter there's a button in the side of the table to call them.  I had butter chicken and saffron rice. The portions of the rice was not enough to finish the butter chicken but then again butter chicken is mental to eat with naan. When I asked for the butter chicken the waiter asked how spicy I wanted it and I took the spiciest they make it, to my surprise they actually made it spicy and still flavourful. The rice had the aroma and the hint if cream and spices was present in the rice such as nutmeg and other good things.  I half to get a naan because the rice only let me finish 75 persent of the butter chicken. They also ask you if you want the naan with butter or plain. To finish off i got a mango lassi which was ok not the best but i have the feeling it's pre made because as soon as i ordered it she came back in less than a minute with a tall glass of mango lassi with a straw.   All in all i spent 26 dollars and it was well spent. If are in the area and hungry i would definitely recommend you try this place and not the one right next door to it"}
{"text":"I have been looking for good Indian food, predominantly in the West end (imho all the Indian restaurants in the Junction are mediocre) in Toronto for several years.    I have finally found amazing Indian food here!  The naan is light and fluffy.  The sauces are flavourful and not too greasy.  The service is great - prompt and courteous.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are satisfying.  Plus there is free parking.  All in all we had a great experience and there is a sheltered patio that you can just to sit under with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"The butter chicken and naan bread were truly delicious.  I went with a large group (15 people), so we had a few difficulties getting some of the orders correctly, but once served, everyone enjoyed their food tremendously.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good food- and lots of it.  The bread is delicious.. Usually get the meal platters with various selections."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order the Baingan Bharta and Chili Chicken. Both are so tasty and perfect with plain Naan and some rice.   Also ordered: Butter Chicken - a little on the rich side, but delicious (my boyfriend's fav)   Chicken Tikka Masala- lacking in flavor compared to everything else. This was my least favorite of the bunch. It just tasted like chicken with tomato."}
{"text":"I asked my indian friends to take me to a superb indian restaurant in the city and they took me here, so i had extremely high expectations. Overall, it was good, but it didn't blow me out of the water. Maybe it's because my heart is set on indian food from Penang, Malaysia, where I had the best indian food in my life. Or maybe it's because the things that they ordered weren't my kind of thing I would order (lamb roganjosh, seekh kabab, chilli chicken) and when i asked for tandoori chicken, they ordered it bonelessssss for heaven's sakes! (Chicken tikka boneless). Boneless is always so dry! Anyway the only thing that I really enjoyed was the butter chicken. And the naan was good. The chilli chicken was too sweet for me (and maybe cuz i had preconceived idea that it would be similar to Hakka chilli chicken which is stupendous and spicy and salty) , the lamb was meh, the seesh kabab was good I guess but not amazing-give-me-another-one-fantastic. So yea everything was just standard for me, still nothing that persuades me to fave some indian dishes. But later on my friends told me they had asked to tone down on the spice, to \"accommodate\" us non-indian eaters. Sigh. Anyway, ill continue my search for amazing indian resto in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place give AMAZING value - I went recently and both of us got their veggie thali which was HUGE. We really could have just ordered one as we had way too much food. The service was great as everyone is super friendly PLUS they have free parking!  The food overall was good, with exception to their dhal - which usually is my fav dish - nonetheless, overall I still give it a 4/5."}
{"text":"Following rave reviews by our friends and checking the overly positive reviews on Yelp we chose this local North Indian eatery for dinner on a Friday night.  It is excellently located in downtown Toronto at Bloor and Christie and has ample off street parking.  Arriving at 8 pm we (four of us) waited more than 40 minutes for a table.  Worth the wait we all agreed as the full and friendly room promised a lovely evening.  Our evening was lovely but no thanks to the food or service.  Service started out fine but when we all had our food on the table, distributed to our plates and no naan or roti on the table we had to get someone's attention to point out the oversight.  The room was very noisy so we had trouble getting anyone's attention but then bread was immediately provided.  We ordered five dishes, 3 meats and two veggies.  The tandori chicken was dry and overdone, the butter chicken was sparse and not very creamy and the eggplant dish was a bowl of warrm mush with a vague sense of indian spices.  The aloo gobi was satisfactory (hard to screw that one up) and the rogan josh was not tender enough but ok.  The bread (garlic naan) was too thin and too light in flavor for our taste.  We had a lovely evening because of the warm atmosphere and excellent company but the meal itself did not satisfy and we thought was highly over rated."}
{"text":"If someone asks me out for an Indian restaurant; I prefer to steer clear but this time I couldn't and landed up at Banjara Indian Cuisine restaurant.   Apart from the Indian food and Indian servers there wasn't anything so Indian about the ambience. But as I entered, the aroma just got stuck in my head. This was the tandoori meat and naan that I can smell.  We asked for a table for two which we got after waiting for 10 minutes on a busy evening at 8. I like the servers here and must say they were very warm. Soon we got the table and our order was taken swiftly. We waited for 20 minutes for the appetizers and mango milk shakes to arrive which I would say was worth the wait.  As we proceeded with the main course, Banjara continued to flatter us with the quality of the food. We ordered very spicy and hot version and we got it exactly how we like. I must say there is a huge scope for improvement for garlic naan as it was very low on salt and the half cooked garlic was little depressing. But as the chicken preps were on best side, it covered up for the poor naan's (in terms of taste).  Overall good food and happy experience."}
{"text":"This place is great Indian food at very good value! We had the butter chicken, spinach lamb, lamb curry, paneer and spinach all of which we would order again. We were very surprised with how much food we got for the price!"}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times in the last 6 months and they are amazing! Everything I've got from here tastes good! They have vegan options as well. Keep up the amazing quality and the amazing service the staff always provides!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food in Toronto. We ordered the lamb rajan, butter chicken, and malai kofta with a side of onion kulcha and paranthas. The lamb and chicken were ordered extra spicy and kofta at a medium, but we barely felt anything..definitely could have added more kick. Flavors were good, and the mango lassi quenched the thirst.  Interior and ambiance is what you could expect of a standard Indian restaurant. The call buttons near each table were a convenient way to get the servers' attention while not having to wait too long. Service was definitely very friendly and warm. Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered online, food decent, delivery was very fast"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite indian restaurant in Toronto. Solid, well rounded spice, available authentically hot. Good ingredients and variety on the menu, decent atmosphere and fair prices. I particularly like the okra and daal makhani. Fresh and not overly oily. It's not the best indian i've had in my life, but it's the best i've found in Toronto."}
{"text":"Very fast service, and good veggie samosas. The curries however.....a bit too oily, pretty tasteless and not like in India or England. Garlic naan was large and pretty good. Chicken was at least good quality. Overall blah....seems the way of Thai and Indian good in Toronto sadly."}
{"text":"I was there a week ago and I was shocked how the food quality is not there anymore. The breads where tasty, but the rest just lacked everything,   We were 7 and we ordered a lot of food, the Daal was mushy, I ordered the hot sauce on the side it was mild at best. The rest of the food did not wow me over.  I was surprised about this because until now its been my favouirte Indian restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices, content with service."}
{"text":"FatCat watch many documentaries...  One documentary showing how life is in India..  Sooo many people everywhere... No white lines on roads.. no traffic lights anywhere.. people trying to sell you something on every corner...  cows walking around streets like its no body business..   Total Chaos for FatCat...  FatCat always wonder how country actually still functioning...   Well..  Now FatCat get a small taste of it  right here in Canada at Bajara restaurant, where entropy is in overdrive...  Things FatCat like  - Foooood.  Friend asking what they should try when they go.. FatCat say it doesn't matter, because everything is very good.  - Have parking lot - but not try to park here if you have SUV or other big car.. Don't ask why.. Just trust FatCat.. Park on street.  Things FatCat not like  - Total chaos..  Order get messed up by servers.. Place totally rammed like yonge/bloor subway platform at 8:30am on Monday morning.. FatCat trapped behind table and cant go wee..  No one know what the heck going on with food...  But FatCat realize that everything work out in the end somehow and everyone walk out or restaurant alive and smiling..

No more illusion of control over affairs FatCat not able to control.    Then FatCat and crew walk down the street to XO Karaoke (FatCat also do review of XO)"}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time and I have to say that the curry is quite tasty. I tried to Malai Kofta, but based on the dish I am pretty sure the other dishes are good as well. I do think that the naans can get better as I thought it was too buttery and not as fluffy as other naans I had before. But definitely a good place for food if you are craving Indian food!"}
{"text":"Bajara was one of the first restaurants I tried here when I first came up. I was hunting for an indian place and I saw that this one came highly recommended by yelpers.  I love this place. Every time I've gone the food has been extremely tasty. However, what puts this place into my *awesomest restaurant ever* category is that they have a sampler platter. I fully admit that I suffer from food ADD. I would rather have 10 small bites than one large single item.  So the sampler platter here is tailor made for me. It's extremely filling and I adore that it comes with dessert.   Every item I've had has been good. The butter chicken is amazing. The dahl makhani, one of my favorite dishes in all creation, is also super tasty.  The staff is fairly friendly and mostly prompt. I've only had to wave them down once in the 3 times I've eaten there.  The only downside to the restaurant is the rather small dining area. The lack of a true waiting area makes the place feel fairly cramped."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is about. The food is mediocre and the atmosphere is ok. We are missing some decent Indian food at the Annex."}
{"text":"My friend and I came by for dinner on a Thursday and was greeted by an amazing aroma of spices and sauce. We were seated right away and they brought cumin chips (?) over with two sauces.   We ordered the shrimp pakora, a fried rice, a butter chicken and two butter naans. I really enjoyed the shrimp pakora and the butter chicken (it was so flavourful and packed with spices and fresh herbs). The naan was really expensive ($2.50 each?) and the rice was just rice. We were super full and had to pack it all up in a doggy bag.  I would come back for their awesome butter chicken and will try extra spicy next time."}
{"text":"Banjara might look like a weird orange donut store from the outside, but the food is great whether you're getting take-out, having a meal with your partner, or out with a big group.   -------------------------------  The Positive: I've been to Banjara over five times and i've never been disappointed by any dish. The front of house staff is attentive and nice, they refill water regularly and, they are very well informed about the menu. The chefs are very accommodating when you need something withheld from a dish, they adjust spiciness perfectly, and get food out promptly. The prices are all very reasonable. The restaurant is kept clean, and has a nice atmosphere (except for those buzzers by the table for buzzing the waiters/waitress'.)  -------------------------------  The Negative: There have been a couple instances where the cut of chicken used had a muscle in it. When I think about Butter Chicken I think about nice pieces of meat I can chew and swallow; not pieces of chicken that require me to hide my face behind a napkin while I struggle to pull the tough nugget of muscle out of the mouth as stealthy as possible without ruining the appetite of all those around me, and my fiancee is like, \"Brian what are you doing?! Don't put that in the napkin! The waitress will have to clean that later.\" and i'm like \"Well what else can I do with it? I cant just swallow, I'll choke!\" But I digress. I want to mention that this is not the average experience, but happened enough times with the chicken and lamb that I figured i'd mention it.  -------------------------------  The Conclusion: Banjara is a great restaurant with a great staff. If Indian food is your thing, than you won't be let down. And if you've never tried Indian food before, Banjara is a great place for first timers because virtually every dish is delicious."}
{"text":"Eh.... It was alright.  The food was really good. For most people this would be an amazing food experience.   They have a very good lunch/dinner plate on the back of the menu I suggest for vegetarians in a group of meat eaters, as you can get a lot of vegetarian dishes and be very full for a really great price. Comes with rice, rice pudding, a veg dish, pakora, and some dal.  The other options are great if you are in a group. Just get a bunch of curry dishes, a bed of rice or couple naan, then dig in.   Interior was pretty weak, they try to cram in as many people as they can. Service was mediocre, just wave them over to do something.  Price was reasonable for service."}
{"text":"Best Indian in T.O. Excellent delivery. Seriously tastey!"}
{"text":"Oh man. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Found this gem when I was starving and needed lunch. Props for the heaping servings included in the lunch specials and extra props for absolutely fantastic food. I like spice and the spice level is just perfect. But at the end of the day, I judge and Indian place based on their naan. This one does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Have yet to find a butter chicken anywhere in the city that comes close to the Banjara butter chicken. I'm a spice wimp, so I always get the mild and mix it with an order of their plain rice.  Adore this place, just wish I could afford to order in more often---!  I keep buying jar after jar of grocery store butter chicken sauce looking for something that even comes close, and... it just can't."}
{"text":"Love this place:)  Been there just the two of us, in a party of four, in a party of nine, and have had takeaway and delivery. I now feel qualified to give this a solid five stars. The combo plates are great value, and their amazing baingan bartha should be on every list of \"100 Foods to Eat before ...\""}
{"text":"The B in Banjara actually stands for BEST. Seriously, dinner here a few weeks ago was just so delightful, flavourful and filling that I can't think of another word to describe our experience.  This place runs like a well oiled machine and the staff (whom I might add are in abundance) are all about top notch service. My beer, not my water glass ever went a minute without being topped up by someone.  For dinner we went with their butter chicken and the palak paneer, and shared a side of Jasmine rice and garlic naan. We shared everything and I really wish we hadn't because I selfishly wanted all the butter chicken to myself, it was so good. I did think that the portion side overall was a bit on the small side, but maybe that was my desire for more that got me flustered.  There aren't a lot of great Indian spots in the city, and Brampton/Mississauga is sometimes just too far when you want a quick fix, so I'll definitely be back here.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"I've only been here once and the food for the most part was fantastic.  The butter chicken was moist and succulent, the rice and naan was great, and the shrimp dopiaza was excellent.  The only dish I wasn't the biggest fan of was the navratan curry but it wasn't bad by any means.  The service was polite and efficient.  The layout of the restaurant is a little strange.  Walking in, it looks almost like a McDonald's with a big huge counter at the front.  The outdoor patio is great during the summer months."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my delivery order tonight! I do think it's the best Indian restaurant I've found in Toronto. I ordered butter chicken, peas pilau, garlic naan, meat samosas, papadums. This is the first time I tried this restaurant and it won't be the last. Portion size was huge, and they put a lot of pieces of tender chicken breast, not just a few chunks of cheaper dark meat like some restaurants. Delivery took an hour which is very reasonable. Peas pilau has LOTS of onions which was different than I'm used to but I enjoyed it. They even threw in a complimentary small rice pudding. I don't know if it was deliberate or a mistake but it was a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Great food authentic Indian at reasonable prices!  Got the butter chicken with garlic naan which was fabulous."}
{"text":"Love ordering from this place! The restaurant is good but get very busy some time and it can be loud."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to for 15yrs.  Prices are good and curries are delish.  Love the lamb and the butter chicken.  Always crowded for good reason.  A few grumpy servers over the years but that's about it."}
{"text":"Potentially the best Indian food in the GTA and the best lamb korma I've had in the city. The staff is really friendly and accommodating families, can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"This Indian restaurant is right in my neighborhood and is great when I want to satisfy my cravings for exotic spices. I've tried their beef madras and lamb vindaloo. Both are excellent not too spicy for my palate but for the uninitiated it might kick you on your butt. I remember they used to offer a lunch buffet but no longer. It seemed very popular. Maybe they will bring it back someday."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Toronto hands down. Service is a little impersonal, but the food makes up for it and then some. The portions are more than adequate, the spice is generous, the flavours are abundant. The food honestly never misses."}
{"text":"Banjara est l'un des must pour la gastronomie indienne √† Toronto. Je recommande le butter chicken accompagn√© d'un bol de riz. Comme accompagnement vous pouvez √©galement prendre des galettes. Le service est tr√®s pro et souriant.  PS : chaque table est pourvue d'un buzzer pour appeler la serveuse. Tres pratique quand le moment de calculer l'addition s'eternise....   // Banjara is one of the must go places to have indian food in Toronto. I do recommend the butter chicken with rice, you can also order some chapati for appetizers. PS : each table has a buzzer which is very useful when you need to call the waitress and not make her wait while you go over the bill."}
{"text":"This place is the best Indian food I ever had. It is dream and full of mouth watering/drool pooling flavors. The curries are not watery saucy; instead they are deliciously chunky from raw ingredients. It makes a wonderful combination of texture and flavor. I have not found anything like this place.  The place is often packed and yet the takeouts are just as good. Portions are generous and prices are great for the magical culinary journey that your tongue is about embark on.  Personally, Not sure what to recommend because everything I had are great. I also go to this place when I am in town and this might be my favorite place to eat. I would give it a 6/5 if I could."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in a long while, thanks Banjara! Good value, and definitely good taste.  I'd make this my regular place if it were closer to home.  I'll be back.  I like that we got variety out of their combo offerings.  We finished our meals (just barely) and were able to choose the mains that we wanted.  Service - Nice.  Even though the place was empty, we had to flag their attention a bit as they had just opened.  But, their niceness and promptness made up for everything.  Beef Korma - Sweet & rich, moreso than others I've had in the city.  Delicious! Lamb Rogan Josh - Nice deep flavour.  Rice & veggies & desserts - All very consistently good."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every dish I've tried has been really delicious. Mmm!"}
{"text":"After two mediocre Indian dinners, I needed to cleanse my palate and mind of those meals. Banjara was at the top of a list of highly-recommended places to try, so I chanced it and came here for dinner.   Saturday night, 7 pm. Prime dinner time. There's no wait, but the place is lively. That's a good sign. The tables are a little too close together, but we can handle it. Service was pretty good tonight, perhaps because we were seated four feet from the host stand where all the servers congregate.  Quick dinner combination seems to be the way to go: for $15 CAD, you get naan, rice, daal, veggie pakora, aloo gobi, rice pudding, and your choice of an entree. Great way to sample things. So my first night I got the lamb rogan josh (medium). It's a gamble because it's so easy to mess up lamb; it wasn't the most tender, but it was tasty. The daal was flavorless. I left it. Veggie pakora was amazing. I upgraded to garlic naan, but it honestly didn't make much of a difference flavor-wise. The aloo gobi is good. Rice and rice pudding were pretty standard and what you would expect; nothing special. Got our bill quickly and departed on a good note.   The second time I came here was the very next day for dinner; apparently I hyped up my night a little too much to my boss. We got seated much further away this time, next to the windows in the back. We were told that there is a button under the table that signals your server. Well, the button did not work. When we flagged down a passing server, she said that it was broken. Great. Thanks.   My boss ordered us the house mixed grill so we could try a bunch of things. The fish and chicken were the highlights of that dish; everything else was pretty gamey. Onions were on point, though.   We both still opted for the dinner combo, and this time I got the chicken korma (medium). Just a brief note: medium isn't at all spicy. Choose to go heavier if you want a kick. Anyway, the korma was fantastic, but I had the same issue with the daal (no flavor) and garlic naan (not worth the price to upgrade). Everything else was solid. They brought us chutney this time as well, which I was not fortunate enough to get during my first experience (and probably would've enhanced the lamb). Service was MUCH slower this time around, and it didn't seem like any of the servers were more than passively working. I saw our server on her cell phone behind the host stand multiple times, chatting with the other ladies.   I don't care if you chat on the job during downtime, but when people are trying to get your attention for things that they need to enjoy the meal or finish it, the least you could do is look up. Or have a working button. Second experience much more meh than the first. The food is around 3.5 stars, but the service and ambiance (or lack thereof, seeing as there's little space between you and your neighbor) drag this place down to 3 stars for me.   Maybe I'll try take away next time."}
{"text":"It is a beautiful place with good service. It is the best place to get a perfect Indian food. I had tasteful dinner last night with my friends"}
{"text":"Like I really have experienced better. And this isn't me being condescending and saying \"my mom makes way better food\" but there are other places to go to for Indian* food.  To order you press a bell and the server comes to you. We got the shrimp pakora, veggie samosas, green beans, butter chicken, and garlic naan.  It was all so ho-hum. There is a word in Hindi - swad. Swad is more than just flavour - it is the lip smacking that occurs after having an incredible bite. Indian* food is usually packed with swad. This had none. Not worth the calories. I will say their butter chicken had huge chunks of white meat which some places do lack.   Other places to go - Lahore Tikka House, The Host, Bukkhara Grill (in sauga).   Overall - wouldn't come back.   *Indian food is a misnomer. India is a massive country with many different languages, ingredients and culture. The food that represents North India is completely different than South India - so really there is no such thing as \"Indian\" food. It's like saying \"European\" food and thinking that pasta from Italy should be grouped the same as bratwurst from Germany. Just a little food for thought :)"}
{"text":"1.5 stars (because the Paneer Tikka and Paneer Makhani were just delicious).  We went to Banjara for dinner on a Tuesday night to celebrate a birthday. There was ample parking. The place appeared quite full. The ambiance was old and boring.   For appetizers, we ordered the Paneer Tikka (amazing when piping hot), chicken tikka (very poorly spiced), cauliflower tikka (meh) and vegetable pakoras (meh). For the mains we had Dal curry, spinach, veg korma, andhra chicken and paneer makhani. Everything except the paneer was just awful. Although the naan was warm (we ordered garlic and methi), that is to be expected from every Indian restaurant which serves punjabi food.  Seeing as to how this place is owned by Andhra people, we ordered the Biryani, which sucked. It seemed as though they had large pre made batches of the stuff and they just spooned some into a serving dish.  The staff was friendly but just terrible at service. When we asked our server for her recommendations, she had none! Also,  we had to beckon them repeatedly to place our order, clear our plates, etc. while they huddled around playing on their iphones. We ordered some wine with the dinner and the server put the unopened bottle of wine (luckily it had a twist cap) on our table and walked away! lol   Overall: The food was terrible, and the service was bad. Would never go back. It did however provide an opportunity to make a lot of fun of my buddy who picked this place!"}
{"text":"Staff is not trained to handle the rush...  No system to take down names for waiting or any welcome desk to go to..  Need to manage the tables better as have to change tables frequently and it doesn't look good..   I would suggest hire a manager who works on floor rather than who stays at the bar..  Or hire someone to work the welcome desk so that she can manage the inflow of people and take down names for waiting...   Anyways, just my 2 cents.."}
{"text":"We received delicious food, generous portions and fast delivery - a great combination. I had butter chicken (yes, I'm that predictable) and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"It's about time I reviewed this place because it's been the only Indian restaurant near Downtown that I've been coming to consistently in the past 3.5 years. The taste of their food can't be beat if you're looking for Indian food downtown!   I often order the malai kofta, which is served at varying spice levels depending on your order. It's the perfect creamy texture, and the kofta balls are soft and tasty (no raisins). The serving sizes are very generous and all their curries can be shared. When I order a takeout curry, I can often eat it for 2-3 meals with rice!   The prices are very fair, curries are no more than $13 generally, making this my go to spot as a student when I'm craving Indian food.   The service here can vary, but I go here for the food rather than the service. My only complaint would be that their naan isn't as good as other places. The garlic naan is coated with a strange garlic powder, and the other naans are just adequate."}
{"text":"FILTHY WASHROOMS.  Oh Bajnara. I r like your food. In fact, in the past two weeks I visited your restaurant twice . It will stop today since I visited your washroom.  The toilet was broken. The handle on the toilet seat was missing . It would not flush. Old urine in the toilet.  The baby cot caked in dirt. It appeared as though it had been a very long time since the bathroom was cleaned. The  oversized waste bins were  overflowing  with trash and the open drain on the floor caked with mud and something wet.  The walls were filthy, paint pealing. I lost my appetite. The conclusion that I came to is that hygiene is very low on the list of priorities. It's disturbing to think what could be going on in the kitchen.  PLEASE CLEAN YOUR BATHROOMS. FIX THE TOILET. REPAIR THE TILES. PAINT YOUR WALLS. GET RID OF THE CAKED DIRT.   You are sabotaging what should have been an enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place! While I have only ever had their takeout and cannot comment on the service or atmosphere of the restaurant, the food is a definite home-run. Favorite spot for Indian food in the city!"}
{"text":"This review applies for the takeout option only. One of my friend's family is partial to takeouts and go far to get their takeouts. Sometimes they are not too keen to drive out and settle on places within the city. Now that I have tried this spot twice I can form a better opinion. First pickup wasn't pleasant for moi as even though I stood in the entrance for a bit I was smelling of food afterwards (something that is quite unpleasant for winter clothing IMO). Next trip I wised up and just stayed out till the food was ready. Hmm first of the spice level is held back quite bit if you order medium spicy. This is probably to appeal to the western palate. Secondly I don't think their meat dishes are up to par. Now this is comparing with other takeout places my friends frequent. The chicken boti dish I tried was dry and devoid of taste. Sure there was the food coloring to give the appearance of spicy but this is just a tad over food court level. I think they do better with dishes that are either vegetarian or are accompanied by vegetables. On this visit we ordered the chicken with palak and that was decent. I would say 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"The food at Banjara is amazing. I usually can't handle much spice, so I have to opt for the mild, but the flavour is still rich and nuanced. However, the price point is on the mid to high end, but there are cheap and affordable options (like the dinner combo!). I've never eaten in-restaurant, only gotten take-out but my interactions with the staff vary. They can be a bit disorganized. Not the most service-oriented place, but the food and okay price make this place worth visiting."}
{"text":"My cousin and his gf took me here for my birthday. The combo platter is amazing and a ton of good food. We each got one and samosas and a pitcher of beer and it was $75. Will definitely be making a trip back here."}
{"text":"This is the location that delivers to me off of the website just-eat.ca.  The only real problem is that if I order it once in a week, I'll want it every single night the rest of the week...so addictive.  The portion sizes are great, and the containers that the food come in keep the food fresh and hot.  The paneer dishes are outstanding, and I really love the chicken korma as well.  Naan is fluffy and delivered without a trace of sogginess.  Basmati rice is also extremely well done.   I haven't had a single problem with a delivery; nothing has ever been past the expected time, and the delivery men are courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here last night for some takeout. My friend ordered the Chicken Masala but they accidently made him a Chicken Madras, but the mistake was handled quiclky and with professionalism. I had the Lamb Rogan Josh, which was very well done. Included in the ordered was a complimentary order of the chips (papadums?) and some great dipping sauce. I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Best best best ever.  The butter chicken saved my life.  I would also recommend the plack-pan-eer. (don't know how it's spelt... )  Every time i go, i have to make a conscious decision to stop eating or i'll just plough through as though i have 3 stomaches.    The helpings are plentiful and the delivery is free!    i know, right?"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and my bf for rainy day food or \"pakors\" as he told me it was called and I was very impressed! I reply loved all the spices and seasonings on every good item. I will say beware if you are not good at handling spicy good however I love it so I was in heaven! The outter layout of this restaurant does not do it justice. The inside layout and decor is lovely! And we were seated by the window which I thought was a very nice experience. I will say they need a better system when it is busy, but all in all I was not disappointed in one bit. The good hit the spot, did not break the bank, and pricing for beers both local and imported (which I find pairs amazingly with spicy goods) were a steal! I Will definitely be back to try more menue items!"}
{"text":"Unfreakingbelievable! I had the shahi shrimp, naan, rice, mango chutney and a mango lassi for desert. The service was quick and friendly, the food was THE best Indian I have ever had and I guarantee I will be back soon. Tip these ladies accordingly because they deserve it, you will see!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants that I have been to in Toronto - and I have been to quite a few.   I have had a number of different dishes at Banjara, and they have all been exquisite. The amount of food they give you for the price is awesome; especially since many Indian restaurants tend to skimp on the amount of food they serve you. Also, the food is always of a high quality. The drinks and desserts are also somewhat larger, cheaper and better than most other Indian restaurants.  Their servers are always friendly and pretty efficient, and the atmosphere is very relaxing; although the decor could use somewhat of an overhaul in order to give the place more of an Indian feel. Also, they tend to keep everything nice and clean.  It's simply an overall awesome place!"}
{"text":"I have never been in this restaurant, but I order from them through just-eat.ca  They are always on time (or, whatever time just-eat says they will arrive).  The delivery men are pleasant and friendly.  The food comes hot, the naan isn't soggy or anything.  My favourite is the chicken saag and the paneer in a creamy tomato sauce.  You can choose online if you want it mild, medium or spicy - I always get mild and it has just the right amount of heat for me.  They give you a free little dessert with your order as well.   Great value.  Delish!"}
{"text":"Banjara is my go-to restaurant for Indian Takeout. I've never actually visited the restaurant and after reading some of these reviews (specifically about the dirty bathroom) I'm kind of glad I haven't ventured in.   If you plan on getting delivery plan on an hour wait minimum, I live five minutes away and yet there's always a long wait. The first time I ordered I was told I'd have an hour and 5 minute wait. I wasn't quite sure why that extra 5 minutes was added but sure enough the order delivered in 1 hour and 5 minutes.   While the wait for delivery is long, the food is worth it. My favorite dishes are the butter chicken and chicken tika masala. They use all white meat and are not stinge on the sauce, plus one portion could feed three people!   I order from Banjara on a weekly basis and have never been disappointed, it's a great Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"I really love Indian food. I miss home style cook food. this restaurant has a good indian food menu. food is spicy but not like home. i eat the very spicy food so this is not bad for who are not used to. The workers are nice and bring out food fast.  Banjara is a good place for Indian food."}
{"text":"Menu is simple, nothing extraordinary. I expected something more as heard a lot about \"Banjara\". Expectations were more as we chose this restaurant for my birthday and I was really excited. Food is insipid. But I liked Gajar Halwa."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery this evening and I was very unimpressed. Firstly, the driver called us complaining that Bathurst st was closed at queen and could we tell him how to get there? Then he told us that he would just drive to Queen and we could walk 2 blocks to come and pick it up. Uh... No. My boyfriend told him that Bathurst was open south of Queen and that he could find his way here on the side streets.   When the food arrived it looked ok. We ordered the Saag Paneer, Butter Chicken, Lamb Madras and Bhartha. To be honest, none of it tasted that great. All if the respective meat dishes were moist, but the sauces all had a consistency that was a little unpleasant. The bharta tasted smoky, but almost artificial and one if the dishes had whole back cardamom pods on it. Unlike their green counterparts, they can a little nasty when they break open in your mouth.  It was nice that they included papadam with the order. Overall, though, I wouldn't visit Banjara again after this experience. I really liked their food the last time I went. Maybe because it was really spicy, but I remember it being much better than this. Almost hard to believe this food came from the same restaurant."}
{"text":"Banjara is a freakin' Christie Pitts miracle.  I am a regular there and I can vouch for its consistency and total deliciousness.    Here's my top ten list for what makes Banjara great:  10. It's cleaned up the neighbourhood.  That store used to be a seedy Coffee Time.  Then, it was a seedier, \"Coffee Top\" - yup, the new owners didn't bother changing the sign.  Then, if you can believe it, it was a \"Coffee Tip\"!  (That was the last straw).  Banjara rescued that little restaurant space next to the park from being forever only a place that only truck drivers or very, very stoned high school students would want to go.  9. Friendly staff.  I've met the owner of Banjara twice and he is lovely.  He is humble and friendly and clearly aims to please.  The waitstaff there are quite warm (if not particularly boisterous) and they do a bang-up job playing tetris each night with the hordes that crowd into the restaurant at dinner time.  Sometimes they actually don't do a great job, but we forgive them.  The food is really worth it.  8.  Hot means hot.  They've toned down their spice quite a bit from when they first opened (no doubt to sooth our wimpy Canadian tongues), but they can really crank up the heat on demand.  And they always ask how you like it.  With a Kingfisher and some Naan?  Perfect.  7. Whole tandoori cauliflower.  Tender, flavourful, sizzling.  Did I mention sizzling?  6. Variety.  Daal Makhani is creamy and rich, a typical northern Indian sauce.  But Daal with spinach is light with south Indian curry leaves.  Aloo Baingan sees big chunks of eggplant left in tact, along with creamy pieces of potato, while their Baingan Bharta is super smokey, rich and buttery with tons of ginger.  The spinach fry is spicy and full of spinach flavour not masked by other spices.    5. Convenience.  This area is dying for more good restaurants and (as the dozens of reviews attest) Banjara is in walking distance to those of us living in the area, it has free parking and is right next to the park to boot.  So you can walk off your ghee filled stomach watching kids making out by the swings.  4. Rustic spices.  I love dishes that are both complex but you can also taste the individual flavours.  Eating through a dish at Banjara, you bite down on a cardamom pod, a bit of star anise, a crunch of ginger, a dainty curry leaf.  Each flavour is pungent and just right.  3. You can tell that each chef has their own unique flair.  We order a lot of the same dishes frequently and each time, while clearly the same recipe, they have a little something different.  One chef loves more ginger, another makes the eggplant a little smokier, you get the idea.  We really enjoy those little differences, since the quality stays high.  2. Mango Lassi.  Sour, sweet, cold, creamy.  1. Leftovers the next day!  Vegetarian score = 9/10.  Large variety of flavours and dishes and no doubts about hidden meat buried in sauces..."}
{"text":"Decent Indian restaurant. The butter chicken lived up to the goodreviews.  Service was great, the food came out quick and our waitress was friendly. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Banjara is one of the better North Indian restaurants in Toronto. Interestingly, the owners of this place are the same owners as the South Indian place that is next door.   Anyhow, this is a solid North Indian spot that is NOT your low quality all you can eat places. You get what you order and that's it but luckily their portions are really good! I have always left this place stuffed so no worries about value at all. :)  I've never found that any one dish was better than another, the food is all generally good so just feel free to go wild with the menu.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been their a few times now. Firstly, found this place by driving by and turning around to follow and find that smell of amazing curry!! Service has always been amazing. 5/5. Food 4/5...only thing I'd maybe mention is that x-Spicy means I want it for real spicy. Price 5/5. I'd definitely go back either way for the flavourful food."}
{"text":"If this place had a song it would be 'Close to you' by the Carpenters   I'm usually a meat eater but I wasn't even craving meat after this vegetarian meal!  Came here on a Sunday night after Snakes and Lattes The lamb biryani was okay, not the best I ever had but it was alright.  I was craving some paneer and naan bread We ordered paneer and cheese naan The cheese naan was really good, it tasted like pizza. Generous amount of cheese on top The Paneer was amazing, the curry was thick and rich and I couldn't stop getting spoonful on my plate The rasmalai ended the meal perfectly. Milky and a hint of rose water.   5 stars because it was exactly what I was craving and more! Plus it didn't make me sick after! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Aloo Gobhi, Malai Kofta, Karahi Chicken, Kheer -very disappointing. 2 stars for butter naan. Won't visit again ever."}
{"text":"Great lunch and big portions! Had the butter chicken and chicken tikka masala mixed lunch platters. Very good indian food with lots of different flavours. You get a lot on the plate; daal, your choice of curry, aloo gobi, basmati rice and indian rice pudding (not to my personal taste). Pakoras were not as good as I've had before, but naan bread and poppadoms were very nice. More about the food, rather than the restaurant setting itself. Staff are helpful, there is a button press bell by the tables if you need anything which I've never seen before. Would like to go back and try some other dishes :)"}
{"text":"It was Snowing today so i figured the best cuisine would be...spicy Indian food, delivered right to my front door!  So first things first- delivery is $30 min. of food. that's kinda tough if you're having dinner alone. So beware.  Summary: - Vege Briyani- my least fave dish; it was good but not very tasty or amazing - Chicken Masala- spicy and yummy. Very flavorful albeit a little oily. But perfect with the Vege briyani - Shrimp Tandoori- my fave. Prob the best tandoori i've ever had. generous portions- 8 jumbo shrimps cooked perfectly; not dry like most tandoori dishes. juicy and succulent and nice level of spice  This spread was enough for 3-4 people, depending on how much ppl eat. Generous portions and tasty. And i requested that it be very Spicy and it was pretty spicy...unlike other lame places.   Delivery guy was friendly and polite and it came within the timeframe they advised.   Would order from Banjara again, esp if having a group dinner or be prepared to eat it for the next 2 days!"}
{"text":"We ordered buttwr chicken and curry lamb with plain naan and garlic naan. They arw so yummy."}
{"text":"Just had a birthday dinner there - it was lovely. Nice staff, great food, good prices and a relaxed ambiance. A place where you can come as you are and laugh uproariously with friends, and you're not frowned at for being too loud. Ok, we were in a far corner of the inside patio, but it felt like they welcome groups.  I had the veggie \"platter\" with a main of navratan korma cooked mild. It was delicious, and came with rice, dahl and rice pudding, and possibly naan and pakoras (were they included? I don't know). The plain naan was amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious food with plenty of options for vegans. Their chana is excellent. So is their baingan bharta, which is pureed eggplant. That might not sound appetizing but TRUST ME it's delicious. Many other tasty dishes, too.   I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I'm on a tight budget and the prices here are average. They might even be a little cheaper than average, but for me that's still more than I want to spend. I only give 5 stars when a restaurant is both delicious AND super-cheap."}
{"text":"I came to eat here yesterday to satisfy my s/o's butter chicken craving, and it did just that.   Once seated, we were given some fried tortilla-like thing to munch on. Sorry, I don't know the name but it was delish regardless. My s/o ordered butter chicken, and I should have done the same but I figure i would go for something different. I opted for the tikka masala. We also ordered one plain naan and an order of saffron rice.   The food came out pretty quickly. Let's just say - the butter chicken was immensely better than the tikka masala.   This place, although the food is good and the service is subpar, the decor is a bit off. I hated the buzzers we press to call the server over - I felt that was a bit degrading :(   After leaving, I went to class and the food coma sleepiness hit me hard. I could not stay awake for the life of me and had to leave early to go home asap. True story!   Will be back to try some more food items!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here a couple of times and the food is delicious. You also pay less compared to the other Indian restaurants in Toronto. I have tried the chicken pakoras, cauliflowers pakoras, meat platters (thali) with chicken korma, beef rogan josh. I like the naan as it is a bit thinner and not too heavy - perfect for my liking. Try this place - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The dinner platter here is great! You get a variety of curries, pakora, rice and dessert. The rice pudding was one of the best I've had at an Indian restuarant. The service is decent. However, the interior decor are a bit worn out. However, if you can overlook that, definitely come for the amazing Indian food!"}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered the lunch combo and I was pleasantly surprised will all the food that come on the plate. I got the lamb curry with medium heat. The lamb was a bit tough but I liked the overall flavour and the heat was good enough for me. The daal curry was bland and the veggie pakoras were a bit overcooked because they were really dry and crunchy. I liked everything else on the plate. The servers were nice and they brought us a complimentary papadum to nibble on before they took our orders."}
{"text":"Came by here with some friends for dinner on an evening to grab some lovely South Indian food. Came here for the first time and was quite impressed with overall. Walking in it doesn't seem like getting seating appears to be of any issues. Popped in at 7 PM on a Monday evening and was quickly seated. (usually about a 10 minute tops)   The menu appears to have a vast selection from what I have seen. I ended up going for a more traditional dish while some friends have come here for Dosa. I ended up ordering the Lamb Masala also joining the table was the Chicken 65 and some Chicken Curry.   The portions seem plentiful, and the sides of rice and garlic naan were a good and welcoming compliment to the entrees.   Having the Lamb Masala, it was flavourful and a delightful dish packed with great flavor. Lamb was very tender, and the sauce packed with great flavor. If I come back, I would get the medium spice (took it safe since a recommendation of South Indian food being spicy)  The Chicken 65 had a bit of a tandoori flavor with a good minor kick. A good appetizer to start out.  The Dosa came on a large metal serving tray with a decent amount of potato. The sauces were unique, and one of them had a bit of a cardamom taste with gave a burst of delight.   Overall a good place to visit that isn't too expensive. Do recommend coming here for some good Indian food.  Tip: The Contactless part of the card doesn't work."}
{"text":"Was there last week to check it out. Some Yelpers of good repute gave it some good reviews and I need an Indian fix STAT! So we dropped by to check this out.   HINT: Locale is not big on reservations on a busy evening --which is to say almost most of them, so call in and say that \"you are on your way and will be there in 20min.!\" They might take your name and your party's number and hey, when you get there you just saved yourself a 20min. wait. Voila!  The locale is kinda of tacky-looking but in a good way. Also, if you are going to have a serious dinner here at night, do yourself a favour and don't wear natural fabrics, otherwise they will reek to Indian food for a day or so... Just like when you to go Tikka! :-P  Now, to the food... it's alright and somewhat tasty. Definitely worth exploring if you live in the area and don't want to travel far, but far from succulent or orgasmic, like I was led to hope and believe. Service was attentive but for example, the chicken tandoori in my mix meat platter, was as dry as a Scotman's whiskey bottle. Come on Banjara, the place was literally PACKED, so you had to be making tons of this stuff. It's inexcusable to mess up such a simple and highly ordered dish.  Our Pulao rice was a bit on the dry side too(?!). So, our meal was as such that we were forced, mid-meal to order a butter chicken if just to use the sauce to mix in with the dry stuff. That's seriously not cool.   The Daal With Spinach was alright, although again, it feel a bit too dry, as if it had been made a while ago and just reheated, you can tell by how dishes like this begin to crust as they cool. It wasn't bad, but I have had better.   Honestly, I give this place 2 stars for the food and 1 extra star just for the place. It was a bit fun --mind you I was on a fun date. It was cool to see it packed like that, and the servers were attentive, but at $50 for two people, with no alcohol included, I definitely have had better at this level/price point. A pity. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Banjara is the most unbelievably flavourful experience, I can easily say I'd drive from anywhere to have dinner here. Best Indian food in Toronto, you can basically order anything off the menu because it's all delicious. The owner is the sweetest guy, he runs a tight ship :)"}
{"text":"had the pala paneer and chicken..something. really very good. the palak dish was on the milder side of spices, but they made it at a good level spice- they let you choose.  i chose hot, as opposed to the hottest choice, \"very hot\" it was spicy enough to be tasty but not too spicy to overpower the flavour. the chicken was VERY good. I suggest you eat the meat dishes here..the spices seem to pack more punch.  just shy of a five star place, for me."}
{"text":"This place never fails. Amazing options to dine-in or take-out. The cilantro chutney served with Papaddums are to die for... Lol. I would prefer to try Tandoori dishes over anything else...!"}
{"text":"I really like their food. I know Indian cuisine and how it should taste quite well because I lived in India. We had chicken tikka, rogan josh, malai kofta with naan and rice. Naan was not the best I've tried. Chicken tikka was a bit dry to my taste but not bad. Malai kofta was very nice as well as rogan josh. The place was completely full with people waiting in line to get a table. The service was good."}
{"text":"I totally don't get the hype.  All of my friends are obsessed with this place and it's just about the blandest indian food I've ever had.  Not authentic, sugary, and many of the gravies are the same dish to dish!  The butter chicken gravy and matteer paneer gravy is identical.  Places like Little India on Queen mop the floor with this place.   Maybe someone can explain it to me?"}
{"text":"There are, in fact, some decent desi joints in central downtown Toronto. Who knew?  This place is so yummy, and the absolute only Indian restaurant I am willing to eat at in my hood, that will satisfy my cravings for some yummy khana (urdu for food, just had to throw in a bit of brown people talk).   My two fav. veggie options (which many Indian restaurants SKIP) are both available, (btw, they are Baingan Bharta and Malai Kofta) and the pricing is decent, there is a nice little patio, and it's just delicious. Go there. It's good."}
{"text":"wouldn't rate it very high as some of the previous reviewers did. I prefer the near by madras masala. but it also might be my bias towards dosas.  well I was impressed by jeera rice - it was a nice touch. but the other two dishes... eggplant with tomatoes and hmmm the other dish escapes my mind... anyway both of them were a bit too mushy for my liking.  not my fave for the prices."}
{"text":"Ordered the quick chicken combo with samosas - medium spice. The wife had the shrimp combo.  The samosas came out first. It was a little over fried and shell was very hot and hard. The filling was over cooked showing a mush of the ingredients. My main was an assortment of okay to terrible dishes. One of the side dishes were under seasoned and another was cold. The butter chicken tasted like it was reheated and not spicy at all. The naan that came with it was cold and dense. Not that's great.  Service was just okay but a bit disorganized. Server came over to refill our waters but only filled one of our cups. Another came by a few seconds later to refill the other cup. Happened a couple of time.  Overall. Quite disappointed from my last visit. May try the Indian restaurant beside it next time."}
{"text":"I ordered combo and i was so disappointed by the quality of rice!! I tried many indian place and this one I think was so over rating!"}
{"text":"When your Indian friends tell you that this is one of the best spots for Indian food in the city, you have pretty high expectations. \"The best? In the whole city?! Get outta here...\"  On a Sunday night we tried to just stroll in during prime dinner time: bad idea. The place was busy and we had to wait for about 20 minutes. Apparently other people like to go here as well.  I was a big fan of the free papadam, I went through 3 or 4 of them while we were waiting for our dishes. They're basically cumin chips - and you can cover it with the sweet sauces they have sitting on the table - awesome!  We split a few dishes. We get a fish, lamb and chicken curry. To be honest I can't remember exactly which curries we got, but I don't think you can go wrong with any of them, they were all great.  The naan was soft; I normally prefer naan a little crispier but it was good stuff nonetheless.  I didn't like the kebab we had as a starter though -  I though the meat was mushy and I didn't enjoy the texture very much.   Best in the city? I'll have to come a few more times before I'm willing to give it that crown. I don't think it's heads and shoulders above other Indian restaurants, but it's certainly a good meal."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh.... With an engulfing whiff of the scrumptious and intoxicating aromas as I first stepped foot inside Banjara, I had an inkling that it was going to be as good as I had heard.      Word of mouth took me to this wonderful establishment at the corner of Bloor and Crawford (just west of Christie Pits park and a step from my door) and it lived up to it's reputation. You can take my word-of-mouth to heart; delicious and well priced dishes, including both meat and veggie delights!      Recently, a South Indian Cuisine restaurant opened right next door called Madras Masala, inevitably by the owners of Banjara and I can not wait to try it next! Look for the Madras review coming soon!"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to bump this up a star from my last review, after revisiting it last night.  The food was delicious, by and large (yes, back off on the salt in the poppadums, and the garlic naan has a hard edge to the garlic), including the much-beloved mutter paneer.  Service was very fast and pleasant, if a bit hover-y, and the value was great.  Good cheap wine list."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here three times already. I've tried other Indian restaurants in the area but I always find myself coming back here.   Amazing prices, and the portions are great. Service is pretty fast and friendly. There are plenty of vegan and vegetarian options! There's also a lot of seating in this restaurant so I highly recommend it for friends and family gatherings. I also recommend getting the combos because it's a better deal."}
{"text":"We came here on a cold Dec night as our  visit in the summer was memorable with a delish mango lassi and some good Indian food enjoyed on the patio.  This time around the spicy eggplant was good but the lentil and spinach dish was bland.  Lamb rog josh was ok although lamb was almost cooked too long.  It tasted like it was cooked separately and then added to the sauce at the time you ordered it.  Generous portions and took leftovers home.  Got quite busy after 7pm and the service was attentive."}
{"text":"Wow! Every couple months or so I developed a craving for Indian food much like how I dedicatedly must eat Korean/Japanese food every week or so. I'm so glad I found Banjara.   Even though it's not that close to my house, I'm willing to travel a bit to get the lunch buffet here. For $9.99, it's probably the best value and best tasting Indian lunch buffet you can get anywhere in the GTA. Some Indian buffers that suffer from lack of customers will also frequently \"reuse\" their food. But with Banjara, I can taste that everything was made fresh. I went on a Saturday.   Their selection is greater than many other Indian buffets I've tried. They have the typical butter chicken, tandoori chicken, naan, and various other spiced goodness whose names I can never remember. They have lamb, beef, samosa, rice. Whether you are vegetarian or not, you'll find something to eat here. Most importantly, everything tasted GREAT! They even have a few ice cream flavors that I haven't seen before. Coconut ice cream and a few others with exotic names!  Because Banjara combines good price with good food, I proudely give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is our go to Indian delivery spot. Really quality - I mean not amazing but very satisfying and delicious. Beware of the delivery time... it takes time.   The pakoras / samosas / curries / you can't go wrong with anything here.   It really is a great delivery option."}
{"text":"Banjara, the jewel of crusty pits.    I'm not sure if it's just me, but one of the drawbacks to Indian food is that unless it's a buffet you don't really get to try a lot of dishes.  This problem is solved at Banjara, which offers combinations plates!  I had the Chicken Tikka Masala combo ($12.95) and everything was amazing!  Service was cheerful and quick and the restaurant has an upscale feel to it without being expensive.  This place is a great value!  The only slight drawback - the washroom wasn't really as clean as it should have been.   Hopefully the next few hours will go well and this review won't need any updating... :P"}
{"text":"Overall good Indian food - was not blown away by it but would probably order again! We got delivery, and it took a loooooong time (they do say on their online order form that it will take anywhere from 45-90 minutes so I guess just be forewarned)! On the other hand, their online order service is very easy to use so that is a bonus.  Be wary of the 'spice levels'. There were 6: mild, mild-medium, medium, medium-hot, hot and spicy. I think I have a pretty good spice tolerance, as does my fiance, but we ordered the medium-hot and our mouths were on FIRE. Almost couldn't taste the food. Would recommend going down a level on their scale!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family, one of whom had not been a fan of Indian food. We all ordered something different and every single dish was a home run! Even the one not into Indian food loved the butter chicken. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They are always the best as far as service is concerned. Be it in their restaurant or at home you can always expect top knotch service. Can't do better than that in Toronto when it comes to Indian food ya know"}
{"text":"Food was delicious.   Atmosphere was nice.  Service was great, But there's nothing like coming home and puking your guts out.     I wish I could say it was juste but my other friend who ate meat had the same experience.   The girls, who are vegetarians were fine."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here before and always had a pretty good experience which is why I decided to try it again. The biggest disappointment was that our food took two hours to be delivered...and this is after calling at the 1 1/2 hour mark to inquire where it was, so it took yet another half an hour after that. The food was warm, not hot. The rice (saffron) was nasty and almost had a chemical taste to it. I ordered all dishes to be made with medium spice and it all came obviously mild and bland...yes, this Indian food was bland. I didn't know that was even possible. Anyways, never again. I'll stick to my local Indian place that unfortunately doesn't deliver, but is worth the effort to get quality food and service."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first, but now I want to go to this place all the time! The lineups, especially during the warmer months are not for nothing. I've been with just 2 of us or a bigger group (too bad they don't do reservations) but the service was good every time. Delivery takes a bit long, but soooo worth it.  The food is amazing. There really isn't much else to say. My go to dishes are butter chicken, rice, naan, veggie pakoras and this vegetable dish that I can't remember the name of.  The only downside is that I have had a stomach ache after eating there. However, I don't think it's because of bad food, but rather my inexperienced stomach putting up a fight.  Go there."}
{"text":"We three of us went for dinner eating Paneer Tikka,Navratna Curry, Naan , Roti, Vegetarian Biryani and Raita. We requested for medium spicy and it was as expected. Panner Tikka was the best."}
{"text":"Really great Indian food! Large servings for great prices.  They even have pitchers of beer.  Awesome dosa! A local gem."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service is great. The interior is also very beautiful and they play very good Indian music."}
{"text":"Friendly but slow staff. The butter chicken tastes amazing. I like that we could choose the spiciness level of the food. The cheese naan was a delight, really enjoyed it, super  cheesy. The mango lassi was surprisingly addicting; though, the portion of it was small. Overall good atmosphere and I'd return. Best Indian food I've had so far."}
{"text":"Good food, liked the mutton curry and wide range of food to eat. Staff are nice and usually quick on service. Patio is nice to eat in the summer."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place for Indian buffet (I think it's a better deal that way so I can try many dishes at once) and came across Banjara on blogto's list of best Indian buffet and the positive reviews here on yelp. I have walked by the Christie Pit location several times and love the alluring aroma.  So one Saturday my husband and I decided to give their buffet a try. However, we were disappointed to find that there is no buffet served at this location once we got there. It is apparently only available at the Eglinton location according to the staff that greeted us. I know on my part, I could have called to make sure, but I just trusted their website, which did not state that buffet was not available here. We still wanted Indian buffet and there was nothing else that interested us in the area so we took the TTC back down to Queen St and went to Little India (which was excellent and I highly recommend it). We were quite hungry and wanted something closer than trekking up to Eglinton. We are also too annoyed to trek up to Eglinton.  So no buffet served here and they should correct their website information and save some people's inconvenience (and wasting their TTC tokens) by simply adding a few more words in there. I do still have faith in their food and believe they must have some pretty decent Indian food so to be fair, I will give them 3 star, which I think it's pretty generous considering how annoyed and hungry we were that day. If I ever try their buffet at the Eglinton location, I may upgrade the rating."}
{"text":"I love bento boxes. I love the assortment of choices I have in one meal (don't worry, Banjara doesn't serve bento boxes).   I like Banjara because they give you choice and offer dinner platters which are, what I consider them as, \"Indian bento boxes\".  The times I've been there, it has always been full and busy. Waiting is never too long however, so don't fret. Besides, the smells will arouse your appetite even more so, so enough to allow your stomach to.. well.. stomach a whole dinner platter.  I've talked about this platter enough, I think it's time to tell you why I liked it so much. It comes with rice AND Naan bread, a choice of Butter Chicken, Tikka Masala, goat curry, and a few other curry options. On the side there are Pakoras and rice pudding for dessert. All of this is served on a large metal plate. The portion and price are right on. Can't ask for too much more...  I like how I was able to pair the entree with either rice or naan, which are both delicious. Extra sauce goes a long way when you like mopping it with the last piece of naan.  I've tried a few other dishes here too, but I don't remember what exactly and how they tasted.   Overall, Banjara has a lively atmosphere that is cozy but loud. It has good value for the portions but the food is pretty average. Nevertheless, I liked the platters, they give you a taste of everything you wanted to order on the menu anyways. It's a convenient package. Rice pudding I can do without, but it's nice to have a bite to satisfy my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the combo portion was great!  the best thing is that the kitchen was open until 10:30 which is very beneficial in Ramadan! Mango Lassi was great too we would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Seeing that I go to the Madras Masala which is next door, my fiancee decided we should try this place for a change. I was game since I love indian food!  The place is very small and quiet. They have a \"indoor patio\" which adds to the place for seating and makes it a tad unique. The one thing that I found interesting is there is a small button like buzzer by your table. It's to notify the waitress/waiters that your ready to order or if anything is needed. I always felt a little hesitant to press it at times- but maybe that's just me! The service was very good! Attentive and quick.  On to the food! We ordered Paneer Makhani, butter chicken, butter naan and saffron rice. When they came to the table, my tastebuds were jumping for joy! However, when I tasted the Paneer I felt that some flavour was lacking. The butter chicken was good once I ate more of it. But at first bites, my tastebuds were begging for more flavour. We also asked for \"Medium spice\" on everything and seemed to get very mild. The naan and rice were delicious though! So perhaps we needed to try other curries or get more of a mixture instead of two similar ones.  Verdict? I will be back again to try it out and will order different ranges next time. But, as a first impression it was just A-OK."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite Indian restaurant, but i find there is something missing in the food these days.   The last time I was there, I ordered their chicken korma and was greatly disappointed. Something was wrong with the sauce. I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"March 23, 2018  ** Special Note **  The restaurant had a fire this week.  The web site indicates the place is closed.  Please call or check the web site before going."}
{"text":"The quality of the food dropped significantly as their popularity increased. I ordered from them their very first month in business, which was something like 2006 and was pretty regular for many years, but have no desire to eat there anymore.  Banjara became popular when the area started picking up around 2008. The front patio was a big draw and had a nice atmosphere on a summer's night, so they got a lot of sit down business.  Around the same time the quality of the food started to slide but the prices remained high for the area and the portions small. I began to feel ill after eating there. I only eat vegan but wonder if ghee made it into my food, even though I always specified.   A quick glance at their DineSafe history shows two yellow cards in 2013 where pest control, failure to wash hands, failure to wear hair nets among other things cited. Not exactly reassuring.  On top of that, they have had this broken down old truck sitting in the parking lot for at least 6 years and it has never moved, tires are flat. It's an eyesore and takes up parking spaces, so why keep it there? Maybe it's a load-bearing truck that keeps the sign from falling down?  They also added some shipping containers by the back side door off the kitchen where you can see people doing food prep sometimes when the door is open. Yup, food is being prepped inside of shipping containers.  Then they screened in the patio, which made it lose all that nice summery appeal and instead felt like you were eating your grandparent's musty screened in porch.  I now go to South Indian Dosa Mahal for my Indian fix. Sure, it's not the same type of cuisine and the place has no atmosphere to speak of, but the food is prepared fresh when you order off menu, it's completely veg and the price is right.  I recommend giving Banjara's filtered reviews a read through as well for a full picture.  *For locals interested in area history, if you walk around the back of Banjara you can still see the \"Coffee Tip\" sign from when it was a sketchy Coffee Time rip off circa 2000.  Update: The orange Banjara truck appears to have been repainted by graffiti \"artists\" and is now by the back kitchen door and the shipping containers are now in the parking lot."}
{"text":"While I walking along Bloor street, I was met with a sudden stabbing for Indian food and and two choices.  Madras Masala or Banjara.  Based on my previous expierences with Banjara on Yonge/Eg, I decided to go to Banjara. I got the butter chicken thali which included rice, naan, pakora and a couple of veggie curries for $11.99.  The naan was delicious however I found the butter chicken was quite westernized.  I ordered mild and when I order mild at other Indian restaurants, there is usually some heat.  There was none here.    I think this place is a-ok for Indian food starters but if you are looking for very authentic, this may not the place.  So give it a try if you have friends that are apprehensive about Indian food, otherwise there are better options.  Other pro's: service is great, nice ambiance."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars from me. I love their masala chicken and garlic cheese naans. It was one of my birthday dinner meals and the server was very sweet in providing me a plate of four scoops of ice cream with a gulab jamun in the middle lit up by a candle.  Delicious food. Cheap prices. Pretty good service!"}
{"text":"We'd used to order delivery from this place, and when we were in the neighbourhood a couple of weekends ago, decided to dine in for the first time.  Unfortunately, it looks like their buffet is a think of the past, you could see where it used to be setup, so that was a bit of a disappointment, but we decided to stay since it was frigidly cold outside and wanted some good food.  On the food front, things were pretty good.  We had the channa masala, butter chicken, and lamb biryani, all solid in terms of taste, and spice level was exactly as described (be forewarned, when they say hot, it's actually hot).  Overall, a good meal, fast service."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Reviews said it's great but the food was soooo bland.. no salt or spice..no taste..a great menu, busy ambiance, ok service but the food had no flavors.   The parking is also very small but plenty of street parking available. Will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"The food is pretty darned good by North American standards (I am from India and most of the time I find Indian food here disappointing). I especially recommend the tandoori salmon. It isn't \"authentic\" so to speak (I'd classify it more as an \"interpretation\" of Indian Tandoori) but it tastes great nevertheless. The servers are always friendly, the restaurant has quite a lot of seating and they even deliver as far as high park! I am a fan of this place and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Nothing special. Delivery can take over 2 hours!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!  So glad we found this place!  The Mango Lassi was really good.  We had Tandoori chicken, saffron rice, naan, shrimp makhini, paneer makhani and chicken pakora. Way too much food for four people, we'll be eating leftovers for days!   Great quality and wonderful service/ very clean! (Very efficient!  Waiter took our order on an IPhone and we had a little button next to our table to ring when we were ready to order or needed anything.)"}
{"text":"I heard good word about this place so I decided to try it myself. Needless to say I was extremely pleased by Banjara; the flavour and quality of their food, the friendly service,  the unique seating arrangment....it had it all! It's also not too out of the way as it is located  within a 5 min walk from Christie subway station.  I sat in their full windowed seating area wherw I was given a complimentary basket of chip/cracker things (I have no idea what they're called,  but I attached a picture and can assure you they were veeerryyy tasty!). I went with the chicken tikka masala, my brother and dad ordered the chicken vindaloo and the vutter chicken platter respectively. We also ordered a side of garlic rice and plain naan.  Everything was delicious! Average sized portions, and even a little cheaper in price than standard Indian restaurants charge. Nothing was too spicy, or chewy; zero negativity!  The plain naan was perfect for all the sauce included in tue main meat diah. Although the platter certainly offered more variety, I would recommend that if you know what main dish you enjoy (like chicken tikka masala in my case), have an order of that and get either a side of rice or naan to conpliment the main dish.   Only thing I wasn't crazy about was their rice pudding (included in the platter), I simply found it very sweet, but I can see how others may enjoy it :)   I will most certainly return to Banjara, and if you're ever craving Indian cuisine,  this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"Food was fine but not great.  My complaint is that you don't get rice or naan with your entree, and you end up paying quite a bit of money for a complete meal that is just so-so."}
{"text":"It was okay. We ordered the Rogan Josh and mahdras curry and the items were nicely seasoned. Service was kind of quick, which was nice - but there wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant to begin with. The items tasted pretty similar, but maybe that's just me.   It's a decent place to try if you don't know what to eat for dinner, but not really outstanding. It's just ok."}
{"text":"Having indian origins, I am very particular about my indian food. And this place WAS A DISASTER. I came here with my family on a Sunday night, the place was packed so we had to wait a decent 20 minutes to be seated. I was very excited because I haven\"t had Indian food in a while. For starters we ordered the Paneer Tikka. It was delicious ! But then the nightmare started... We ordered dhal makhani,palak paneer and a few butter naans. We asked for mild spices, and to my surprise the food was SWEET!! I was so sad and disgusted!  Never coming back to this place ever !!"}
{"text":"Food was good, I bet it would be delicious if it arrived faster. the Naan was cold unfortunately. Ordered delivery (2 butter chickens + naan) at 6:10pm, food arrived 8:15pm. We live 3.8 km away. Maybe because it was such a rainy day they were saturated with orders, I'll give it another try, as the food was still worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've now upgraded to regular customer.   Staff are not so familiar with English,  but the food is what I came for.  Great portions, meat dish each for you and your partner and 1 rice dish will suffice.  Food was tasty and filling!  Highly recommend the butter chicken!!  Got the tiki masala chicken both of the 2 types and neither was up to party. . Not enough gravy. But tasty yes but I'll always from now on have the butter chicken.    GREAT FOOD."}
{"text":"Are you serious? Indian buffet for $9.99 in an ok neighbourhood? Why didn't anyone tell me about this? I went here for lunch today because I figured I needed a day off from sushi. It was a very pleasant change.   The food was good. Not the best in the city and pretty much devoid of heat. It was all tasty, though. There was also more \"stuff\" in the sauces than other buffets in town. Like there was actually paneer in the mutter paneer. The appearance of the naan put me off at first but it was actually delicious and buttery. The mango salad was really nice. The ice cream selection was good. Mmm pistachio kulfi and rose falooda. The kheer needed a visit from the cardamom fairy, though.   I rated four stars because the food could use some more masala and I was the first person in the restaurant and the toilet was unflushed (gross). I'll definitely be going back, though. Awesome value for the money."}
{"text":"Before I get into this let me know where I am coming from. I am a Brit living in Canada now for 20 years, I have travelled extensively through India over many months and eat a lot if Indian food both throughout the UK and the sub-continent. I came to this restaurant after reading the BlogTO best Indian biggest article rating Banjara as the best Indian Buffet in Toronto.   The buffet itself was well stocked and looked clean with a good variety of both meat and vegetarian options. I decided to honor the tradition of the buffet and tired a little of everything; aloo gobi, bindi masala, mushroom curry, 'egg fried rice', lamb masala, butter chicken, tandoori chicken and Naan.   On the plus side the naan was quite light and fluffy. However, this is just about where the good stuff ends. The food was basically bland and all tasted the same. There was really no discernible difference between the sauce in the lamb to that of the mushroom and now add all the other dishes and I defy anyone to do a blind taste test and accurately differentiate between the multiple dishes. Personally I like to have a hot (spicy) curry, however, I can forgive a place for not terrorizing an average customer, however, bland curry is a sin that should be punished most severely - I would even like to see a section in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms on this one.    The Butter Chicken was creamy and flavorless, worse the tandoori chicken was completely devoid of anything that resembled taste.  It is clear that this supposed Indian restaurant is not roasting their spices from scratch but rather using packaged sauces industrially produced to save money and time. The result unfortunately is to inflict inferior food on the unsuspecting public.   Once again, I will roam the GTA looking for a place to provide the curry fix I so desperately need - Banjara is not the place and I do not forgive them for the crimes committed against flavorful food."}
{"text":"I know little to nothing about Indian food.  I once mistook 'rogan josh' for Josh Rogan, someone how I assumed was related to Joe Rogan.  True story.  This being said, whatever type of Indian food Banjara has, authentic or not, I am buying.  The naan is fresh and yum.  It is a nice mixture of chewy, toasty, and deliciousy.  The veggie pakora is well textured and perfectly deep fried.  Butter chicken is a must.  Many others have been consumed, but if you read my first line, you'd realize that I can't remember all these food names.   Tip: save $1.50 by opting for regular naan over garlic naan.  The taste difference is minimal, especially after submerging it in the butter chicken.   The overly packed (but free) parking lot is a nice touch too."}
{"text":"Banjara!  Another reason I miss my old digs on Concord.  I have eaten here several times and tried a number of things off the menu although usually vegetarian.  Everything has always been incredibly delicious.  As with most Indian places, the selection is incredible.    I have never had an issue with service.  That Tiger beer, either light or dark, is also a treat.    Compared to others, it might be slightly more expensive but I think it is money well spent.  Real napkins!    Good date place.  Highly recommended for Indian West of the Don and along the Bloor."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken madras and daal with spinach. Despite the place being fairly busy which gave me the impression that the food is good, the food taste was nothing above average. The chicken madras tasted bland and the daal with spinach gave me an upset stomach. The aloo kulcha was good though!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my boyfriend tonight and I loved it! The food tastes amazing, is full of flavour & very fresh. The service is amazing and all the staff goes out of their way to make sure their guests are enjoying their time there. I'd definitely go  back"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery once, it was decent enough, I liked the option of the combo platter.  Upon ordering delivery a second time, they informed me that it would take 90 minutes, so I told them I would like to cancel the order, as that was too long. They proceeded to charged my credit card and put through the transaction, four days later, still no refund on my credit card. I contacted them yesterday, and they said it would be refunded (when? Who knows!). They didn't seem to have an explanation for why they charged the credit card and closed the transaction in the first place. Irresponsible business practices in my opinion, I will not be ordering from here again, it's a shame, because the food is not that bad."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the best Indian food that I've ever had.  I coordinated an all-staff lunch for 45 coworkers and the food was amazing.  Granted, some of it may not look the most appetizing- but shovel that stuff in. You won't regret it- promise."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from Banjara last night. And it make both my partner and I very sick. (I won't go into too many details of how sick. But you can use your imagination) This isn't my first time eating Indian food either. I eat Indian food monthly, and this place was not good. I'm still sick this morning, I am definitely never eating/ordering from here ever again."}
{"text":"Everyone my girlfriend and I talked to before we went to Toronto raved about this place.  My experience with it was just so-so.  We both got combination platters which are a great idea and I wish more Indian restaurants did something like it.  Each came with a meat or veggie dish, rice, naan, daal curry, aloo gobi, veggie pakora and rice pudding.  It was a very nice selection and you could choose from any main dish on the menu.  The big problem was that the main dishes were not that great.  We asked for one spicy and one medium.  Neither came out spicy at all.  So if you like heat, you should make sure you specify that.  I got the goat vindaloo because I have liked vindaloo in other restaurants.  It was a completely different sauce than anywhere else I've been.  I opted for the goat because I had never had it before.  That was sort of a mistake too because there were a ton of bones.  I've been told that they leave them in to increase the flavor but it seemed to me that there were way more bones than meat.  Also, we had to ask several times for our naan.  The restaurant was pretty busy but the service was not that great even considering that.  It was the second time that I've seen an Indian place take orders using iphones.  And it was the second time that waiters and waitresses didn't seem too interested in being speedy or really that helpful.  It also seemed to be commonplace that they would seat people inside if there was no room outside and then move them when a table opened up.  I'd never seen that before.  It could be that we just didn't order that well, so it would be worth going back to again if we lived in that area.  But if I were to go back to Toronto just for a visit I would try somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food was very generously portioned and was hot out of the kitchen. We also experienced very friendly service! The goat we ordered was excellent. The chicken was delicious although my girlfriend wasn't as crazy as me about it.  The 2 stars lost are for the Cheetah beer pitcher being a bit flat (I have never had it before so maybe just not a great beer) and the lentil/spinch vegetable dish was bland and just texturally too finely minced up which was odd. Also the Onion Bhaji was just ok.  I WOULD come back through for sure, just adjusting a couple of things we ordered as the meat dishes were great, again, portions lovely, Garlic naan tasty and hot and service, friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My partner and I are obsessed with this place.  Every meal I've had has been full of flavour and I'm always given ample amounts of food.  This is the ultimate comforting Indian food in the city."}
{"text":"I had heard from a friend that Banjara had been in the Yonge/Eglinton area for a long time so we thought we would try it for dinner. First, the service was slow and kind of distracted in that our server did not really pay us much attention until we flagged her down (which I don't like doing). The food arrived promptly but was just okay. I had the masala curry with chicken and my friend had the masala curry with beef. We both agreed that the chicken was the more flavourful of the two dishes. I ordered garlic naan on the side which was just okay. The serving of rice was plentiful. We had eaten our fill and our server took our leftovers to pack them up. She then brought us the bill. We weren't asked if we wanted dessert. We decided to concede defeat and pay our bill and leave. I'm not sure I will return. We did frequent another similar establishment down the street which was much better (both food and service) so we may stick to that one."}
{"text":"This is our favourite Indian restaurant in the city. We mostly get this takeaway - I wish the prices were a bit lower.   For dine in you can get a great deal for a lunch combo or dinner combo.   Fave dishes: Veggie Korma, Butter Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo, Aloo Gobi. All medium-hot spice.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"favourite indian restaurant in the city"}
{"text":"Delicious food! We had Malai Kofta, Chana Masala, and Aloo Gobi + Raita, etc.  Very happy! Loved it! So yummy :) The vegetable biryani is great."}
{"text":"Meeting hubby here for dinner one evening.   I read reviews on yelp and people are high recommending it, since i love indian food, and here we are on a monday evening. We had the vindeloo beef and masala lamb - both spicy and both to die for (literally because it's soooo freaking spicy!!). I had some naan bread which was o-kay, not crispy enough for me. The fish pakora was weird, it was like fish fingers, it was flavor-less and it was made with salmon???  I thought fish pakoras need to be a white fish, but salmon was definitely weird. I wont get the pakoras again that's for sure.  I like the appetizers also, it was a few pieces of crunchy cumin crispy slices. definitely got me salivating for the mains.   will come again!"}
{"text":"I have ordered Indian food from many places in many cities and I have to admit that the service here is top-notch.  As we waited for out take-out order, we were asked a few times if we wanted water and they even brought out papad (papadum).  2 stars for service!!  1 star for food: We ordered malai kofta and baingan bartha and while both dishes were good the food was not memorable. The kofta were very hard and that is not okay for this dish. The eggplant dish was good but again nothing special.  The papad we were given with take-out was broken in small pieces and I ended up adding it to my malai kofta gravy when I ran out of naan.  But do give this place a try and be your own judge.  I have extremely high standards for Indian food since I cook it at home and have some good Indian food available in NYC."}
{"text":"One of the Best Chicken Biryani i had in toronto. Its unique. I highly recommend this place for Indian food. Make sure to customize your order based on your spice level.  Butter chicken and other pulav rice items are decent"}
{"text":"Been to Banjara several times and we order food from there at least once a month.  The food is good, the portions are large, and the value is excellent.  It's not a fancy place, very basic, and it's often busy (so plan ahead).  If they have a table of six and you are two, they will put you together if it's busy.  The staff can be a bit gruff when it's busy.  The food is similar to restaurants in Delhi (i.e. - northern Indian food) but slightly Canadianized.  They have all the regular foods: butter chicken, dahl, aloo ghobi, etc.  The naan is excellent and made in an authentic fashion.  They don't have a huge selection of chutneys, if that's your thing.  Oh, and there are usually a lot of people of Indian decent eating there, so that's a good sign."}
{"text":"Honestly have only done takeout, but I have to say that the quality is excellent, and the service has been above and beyond the call. Hope this location reopens soon."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for a long overdue girls dinner on a weeknight.   She was craving Indian food so I did a search on Yelp and decided to go back here (I had been once, years ago and enjoyed the food). I was excited for the chance to have Indian food as I truly love it.  We both opted for the platter options - my friend chose goat curry and I opted for the mutter paneer (normally my fave Indian dish). The platters came with naan, rice, aloo gobi, daal, and rice pudding. I found the savoury dishes to be mostly flavourless and really greasy which was pretty disappointing. Naan was decent. The rice pudding had an odd taste to it so I only had a spoonful.  While the service was good and I enjoyed my visit with my friend, I would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"I've been to so many Indian restaurants in Toronto, however, I've found out that Banjara might be my favourite one. The food is amazing with so many vegetarian options. The staff there are SO KIND. You go and sit there, and push the button next to your table whenever you are ready to order. It doesn't take that long to get your order BUT, on the weekend, it's really crowded. You may need to go early, or reserve."}
{"text":"I have grown up eating Indian food and suitably capable for identifying the best Indian eateries in GTA. For me, Banjara is right up there among the best Indian food places which deliver as well.   I prodded five of my now brown friends from Montreal to go to this restaurant. For folks who haven't been to this place before, the layout of the restaurant is kinda clumsy. When you enter, you don't see a receptionist to ask for tables. Instead you see a bar counter with hordes of servers scurrying around. You go and ask them to be seated.   I was asked to order the food (wondering if it had anything to do with my ethnicity ;). We ordered two butter chicken, chicken korma, daal makhani, tandoori platter and naan. To my pleasant surprise the server asked me about the level of spiciness that I wanted. Mild was the flavor of the table, hence that's what I asked for.   15 minutes later the food arrived. Food didn't look that presentable, only because of the low lighting which the restaurant has. But the food was A-awesome for everyone. Here is the individual review:  1. Butter Chicken: One of the best, if not the best I have had in Toronto. Creamy & buttery with big juicy pieces of chicken. The quantity was sufficient for three people (yes, we are light eaters).   2. Chicken Korma: Very rich and heavy with equally big chunks of chicken. I wonder how they can afford to keep the prices at $10.99 for that much chicken! Nonetheless, the dish was just perfect for my white friends, who couldn't be bothered to eat spicy food at all!   3 Tandoori Platter: Mix of Tandoori Chicken, Seekh Kebab, Chicken Tikka, Tandoori Prawn & Fish. All of the individual items were savory and seasoned with tasty spices. They all tasted very good and we all were practically fighting for the last few pieces of the Chicken Tikka.   4. Daal Makhani: Rich and creamy is just how they like to cook their food! A similar story as the top two dishes and equally tasty.   5. Naan: The only place I have eaten in Toronto where the Naan in round in shape similar to a Roti. It arrived fresh and tasted as if they just came out of the tandoor. They were very soft and was a perfect accompaniment to our dishes.   Yes, we had a chicken overload and would probably need to spend extra hours at the gym the next day, but it was all worth it! Definitely recommended!!"}
{"text":"Whenever we order delivery it's from Banjara. Delicious Indian, at a great value. We've ordered from there for years, and have never been disappointed. The Baingan Bharta is delicious, as is the butter chicken and palak paneer. Definitely a solid Indian option."}
{"text":"Pretty good, pretty pretty pretty good! Curry is good, chicken is tender, biriyani is fluffy, butter naan is perfect! There is a buzzer you can press to call your server on ever table which I thought was fun but I didn't abuse it. The food is delish here."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I don't know much about indian cuisine but damn the butter chicken is good. I saw fireworks when I closed my eyes.  Even the basmati rice blows my mind. Which is funny because I eat rice so often that I don't even notice how it tastes sometimes.  Don't even get me started on the garlic buttered naan. However, I must mention that it has A LOT of garlic. A lot.   I can eat it for days."}
{"text":"After traveling from Utah to come to Toronto for a week, we decided to start things off with a nicer meal at Banjara.  We sat out on the patio on an August evening and had a lovely meal to off-set our jet lag.  This review needs to be prefaced by something that most will dismiss me for - but my wife and I's favorite Indian Food that we have tried ANYWHERE is in the unlikely town of SLC, Utah.  If you're ever in town, go to Bombay House and prepare to die.  It is the best.  The.  Best.  So, when we go anywhere else, we're used to being dissapointed.  And I must say, Banjara has taken it's seat as my 2nd favorite Indian Food anywhere.  The Saag Paneer was wonderful.  The Garlic Naan LOADED with garlic.  And the Mango Lassi was thick and delicious.  All in all, a very worthy meal if you're visiting town."}
{"text":"Seriously cannot get enough of Banjara! It's consistently good, hot and fresh every time I go in or order for takeout. I spend nights even craving it. Take out takes usually an hour or longer but it's worth the wait!   Favorites  Butter chicken Aloo korma Mutate paneer Palak paneer Pakoras"}
{"text":"My first time here was on one of my last days living in this neighbourhood, and as far as Indian food goes, I must say that I was thoroughly impressed.  We had a fairly large table (8 or 9 people I believe) but the waiter was perfectly able to handle our orders and questions as if we were a table of 2.  The food came out quickly, and it tasted like they'd been preparing it for days.  Really an A+ on service and quality.  My one thing to point out is that one of my friends found a piece of tin foil in her dish.  Obviously this impressed no one, but when we showed the server, he was embarrassed (as opposed to annoyed) and offered to comp the meal for our friend.  It was very responsible of him, and the fact that none of the rest of our meals had anything wrong with them makes me thing that this sort of thing doesn't happen often.  They have a nice sized patio and a parking lot, the latter of which is a true rarity in this area."}
{"text":"WOW! What took me so long to try Banjara's Indian cuisine? Well, they often do have long lines, so I guess that played a role.   I did manage to make it in and try a few different dishes and am happy I did. I will absolutely for sure no doubt about it be back.  We went to Banjara after 10PM on a Saturday night, so we missed most of the crowd. Just because it wasn't busy didn't mean the staff took it easy, however. We had multiple people come over and serve us, answer questions, and take empty plates away, and every one of them had a smile on their face and was extremely polite and confident. Several times staff, including one who may have been the owner and/or manager, checked on us and made sure we were enjoying ourselves and our food.  It's nice to see a place run by such nice and hardworking people, with such delicious food, be a success. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Despite how crowded this place can get at night, the resto is quiiiite spacious so reservations aren't required. Each time I've come here, I've ordered a quick combo platter (veggie dinner is $11.99, while any meat or seafood plate is $14.95). These plates can also be ordered at lunch ($10.99 and $12.95, respectively) and come with a bunch of sides: rice, veggie pakora, daal curry, aloogobi, and rice pudding. I've tried almost all of the lamb dises, but my favourite would have to be lamb korma. Absolutely loooove how tender the meat is, and how flavourful the sauces are. What I like about this place is that you can choose how spicy you want your dish to be. The naan they serve is sooo good, especially when it's hot. In the event that you underestimate the heat level you choose, they have lassis on the menu ($3.75 - sweet, salt, or mango) or you can just down the rice pudding (it's kind of watery, and tastes like suuper sweet milk... but not like condensed milk). Service is good, you just have to wave them down buuuut they usually come by frequently to refill the water glasses. I can never fully finish a plate, yes that's how filling it is, and how large their portions are (even though they don't quite look like it. Peep the metal meal platter pic I posted!)."}
{"text":"Not very good. The quality here has dropped tremendously. Quit trying to pass off mass produced pita as Naan!"}
{"text":"Banjara is our favorite home delivery place. You can never go wrong with their biriyanis. Chicken, lamb, goat, I've tried these three and I still crave for more. You can request how spicy you want it. The more spicy the more spices you have to tackle in your biriyani. So I keep it on the medium or milder side. The navaratan kurma is a must try for veg lovers. The rice pudding (kheer) is really good. Not a fan of the naans here. I don't have time to complain after pigging out on the huge biriyani portions and ample leftovers for another meal."}
{"text":"This indian food was TERRIBLE. The sauce had no flavour or kick to it at all"}
{"text":"The combination of price and quality makes this my favourite Indian place in the city. The butter chicken, shahi shrimp, and naan bread are amazing. I've honestly never had a dish here that I didn't like. The restaurant also has bell service, which is another nice touch. The reason I'm giving this restaurant 4 starts out of 5 is that many of the services seem to get easily confused. On multiple occasions, they've had a great deal of trouble splitting the bill, and sometimes forget routine tasks, such as serving papadum as a free appetizer. However, this doesn't stop me from coming back or bringing friends here for dinner."}
{"text":"There are 2 locations. But this is my favourite. REASONS WHY, the waitress actually recommend food and they super helpful. At EGLINTON location all they say yeah its good order it. At bloor, you see alot of different cultures which is pretty cool. Their food is totally different And tastier. I love indian food to begin with but for some reason i always end up in this location."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and always love the Thai's (or as they like to simplify, combos).  Choose a meat, choose a sauce. Comes with pakoras (something fried), aloo goobi (curried cauliflower and potatoes), daal (lentils) rice pudding, rice and naan. It's so much!  The fish is salmon and tastes delicious. We chose a sauce that had this lime flavor to it and it was pretty good!  The lamb was very tender and choosing the Madras sauce was a good recommendation from the server.  As soon you walk in you are greeted. They bring you pappadum (cumin spiced chips). They come refill your water multiple times and is very polite.  The space has like an inside area and a \"sun room\" area. The inside area is very smokey from the kitchen.  Also, you might want to leave your jacket outside the sunroom area at the front door.  Parking is minimal but finding it on the side street typically isn't too hard."}
{"text":"Banjara Indian Cuisine sits neatly tucked on the south-west corner of Christie Pitts park, in a location once occupied by a second-rate coffee shop called 'Coffee Tip'.  The mater paneer is creamy with a hint of sweetness, the daal curry melts in your mouth and the bainngan bharta has just enough spice to motivate your hand to reach for a kingfisher.  The naan is perfect.  The atmosphere continues to improve since their opening in or about 2005.  There is no doubt that Banjara is the best indian place west of Yonge - and a case could be made that it tops the list city wide."}
{"text":"Food was great! Staff not bad. They have little buttons to hit when your ready to order. That's bad ass.  Place was lively, and people looked happy. A little tight for people to get around our table. No over all complaints though. Nice place!"}
{"text":"Really good for such a good price! We ordered some combo dinner. I got thai coconut shrimp (something like that) which was really good, especially the sauce. The shrimp can be better though. The place itself is just okay, no decor etc, but service is nice and the food is amazing.  I recommend."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was such a disappointment.   I was all prepared to love Banjara considering the rave reviews on Yelp, but it didn't meet my high expectations, and Yelpers tend to spot the strengths.   The restaurant has a kitschy Bombay Palace- circa 1990 style. Not a great look considering this place was purchased from a coffee shop not that long ago.   I don't claim to be a food connoisseur, but Indian food I know really well actually, having grown up with it, and having been to the best of the best of Indian restaurants in India and Toronto. Banjara, first of all, is not run by Indian chefs. Now I don't really care who makes my food, but Indian food is a highly creative cuisine, and the variety, freshness, and assembly of ingredients is almost wholly based on the origin of the chefs. He or she can make or break the best managed restaurants through their cultural lean;  -Northern Punjabi/Mughlai food tends to be creamy, nutty, with saffron, turmeric, cumin, etc. made with ghee and meats are marinated with yoghurt.  -Western is sweeter, and tends to use less onions, garlic. -Southern is typically spicy, peppery and is generally oil and water-based, and never creamy nor sweetened.  The chefs are Sri Lankan and you can taste it in the food. The spices are southern and lacking in that creamy, nutty, yoghurt based texture seasoned palates come to expect from Mughlai cuisine. Further, the food here isn't fresh. The watery residue from reheating a meal was more than obvious from my Chicken Tikka Masala. Again, if it were fresh, it wouldn't be watery. I noticed mango lassi being prepared right at the bar area from a mango puree can. If you aren't going to make a lassi from scratch, which sadly is extremely easy and inexpensive to do, at least be discrete about it. I also spotted a huge can of Ketchup and MDH grocery store masala on a shelf in the kitchen from my seat.   Any semi-decent Indian chef will tell you that you should *always* be making your dishes from freshly ground spices.   +1 star for attentive staff.   There are some far better options for quality, authentic North Indian food downtown."}
{"text":"Worst taste of indian food. Everything is tasting the same. I ordered butter chicken which was the worst experience ever and I ordered chicken tika masala. I will not eat here anymore."}
{"text":"Worst taste of indian food. Everything is tasting the same. I ordered butter chicken which was the worst experience ever and I ordered chicken tika masala. I will not eat here anymore."}
{"text":"Good ambience. Situated in the old Toronto. Nice food. Nice service. Free parking if spot available"}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered Banjara through UberEATS and can I say, I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered butter chicken and it was creamy but you can still taste the tomatoes and not too rich. Chicken was made very tender. The lamb curry was bursting with spices and flavour, medium spicy was perfect. Get the butter naan as it was made fresh and had just the right amount of sweetness. Definitely recommend this place as it's one of the better Indian restaurants I've gone to. Even better than Marigold and at a lower price."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch a few weeks ago and ordered the butter chicken combo. I'm not too familiar with indian cuisine but the combo included naan and a bunch of other side dishes. I really liked the butter chicken and ended up finishing it really quickly because it was that good. At first I was sceptical of the portions because the plates made it look like there wasn't enough food, but the meal was actually very filling and unfortunately I wasn't able to finish everything.   Some of my other friends didn't order combos and regretted it because having an entire bowl of biryani gets boring after a while, vs with the combo you get a nice variety of foods. If you're in the area and craving indian food, check this place out."}
{"text":"I like this place mostly just for the parking spots it offers!! But I must say their food is really good too, it's not the BEST Indian food I've ever had but it's one of the better ones!  Forget about decor or ambiance here, it's all about food here. I was thoroughly impressed with their varied breads, rice, etc to add an addition to the traditional types of Indian food they serve.   Their prices are affordable, portions are large (both me and my guest had to take a bit of our food home, as did the two tables beside ours) and food is good! What more can you ask for? Oh wait yeah perfectly made Mango Lassi! Woohoo"}
{"text":"Went there last year and never again!There was a cooked roach in our food ! And then someone from there store on fb ( double post) said it was a spice  The thing had eyes and antenna... Gross ! If I could give negative stars I would !"}
{"text":"I love Indian food; more specifically butter chicken. So no surprise I would check out this restaurant that's been highly praised.   The cumin flat bread, fresh but far too salty for the average tongue, you're gasping for water after the first couple bites.   Saffron rice was alright; my boyfriend loved it I thought it was just okay. But the naan (which I'm sure you can't mess up) was far more superb!   We ordered the lamb and spinach curry and butter chicken. The lamb and spinach; surprisingly tasty- still can taste the lamby taste but quite delish. The butter chicken I must say was just okay, nothing amazing compared to Everest.   As for the atmosphere you have to for sure bring a jacket or a cover up, absolutely freezing. I'm sure in a matter of 10 mins the curry is past room temp and border refrigerator temps.   The service was great, very attentive and very quick but it wasnt busy (though it was a Friday) overall not a bad experience but I could say I would try other places before I go back"}
{"text":"I am torn whether to give this restaurant two or three stars. The food was alright, but not up to the high standards of Toronto Indian fare. Granted, my meal was inexpensive and the portions were huge, but the taste was lacking. The woman who seated us was wonderful. If she was a host, I hope she will be promoted to a serving position. Our server, however, was terrible. She scoffed at my husband when he said he wanted his meal to be spicy. When his food came, it wasn't what he ordered. We didn't want to bring it up, partially because our server was moody and partially because we'd discussed trying something new anyway. After we received our food, our server continued to act like she detested our presence and didn't speak another word other than when she came to clear our plates. At that time, I asked for a to-go box. After I had cleared my leftovers into the box, our server took all the plates except for my husband's (because he was clearing his food into the to-go box as well) and then stood, watching my husband, with a scowl on her face until he was done. When she brought our cheque, again, she said absolutely nothing. Finally, she glared at me, without saying a word, the entire time my card was running. We're polite customers and since I've spent a lot of time working in the service industry, I'm well aware what it is like to be a server and how customers should act. That said, I'm wholly confident that we did nothing to provoke our server to act like we took a wiz on her parade. The whole experience was weird. It seemed like the other servers were much nicer and I wonder if we just came on an off night for the food. Regardless, I doubt we'll be back, since there are too many other options in this city to justify giving someplace sub-par a second chance."}
{"text":"Take out showed up promptly and was delicious!!  We enjoyed palak paneer, aloo gobi, daal makhala, palao rice and naan. They added free wonderful papadum.  I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Winter is approaching, and along with the cold weather i'm finally working up the courage to dine Indian, Toronto style! So this place has gotten some pretty good reviews lately, but after trying Mt Everest Indian last week the standards were set pretty high ;)  I ordered the Lamb Masala, Peas Pulao rice, and  standard Naan bread, original flavour (the radio edit). The bread was just flawless, had the right pull, was fresh, the perfect compliment to any main dish.   The rice was cooked perfectly, and had just the right amount of peas and a few light veg to add that extra health kick. The lamb while satisfying, i found to be just a little too tough and overdone for lamb. The flavours were good though, but didn't really have that kick that i look for.  The service was efficient despite having minimal staff. It was a quiet night and there was only 1 girl working both the room and the front desk. I was getting take out and she was taking the order of a couple dining in, who were taking forever to order their food. But she convinced them to think over it for a few more minutes so she could come over and serve me."}
{"text":"We were at Christie Pits Park and decided we would check this place out. We were seated right away when we got in. The staff was patient in giving us time to go through the menu and in answering questions, which was much appreciated.  I don't have much experience with Indian food other than two staple dishes, Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala, so my friend and I decided to order two dishes and share. We ordered Chicken Pakora, Chicken Biryani and Mater Paneer with Garlic Naan and Keema Naan.  After our orders were taken and the food was served, it seemed like the staff  forgot about our side of the restaurant. Based on reading other reviews, maybe it was a bad night? Water glasses weren't refilled, people had to flag staff to get them to come to our side of the restaurant.   However, the food was delicious and very filling! The portions were big enough that we had leftovers to bring home. The stars are missing because of the service, but I will probably be back again so there's room for improvement."}
{"text":"I am not a fan.  Service was terrible. We went for buffet and all the time we were there buffet never had enough food.   There was a time when there were no plates for 15 minutes. There were no nans until just before we were done.  There was only one wait staff and that poor girl was struggling to keep up.  Food was not bad however service just gave us bad taste and the whole experience was not pleasant"}
{"text":"Uh so I came here with a very hungry stomach and frankly wasn't all that satisfied. I ordered the seafood thali, which in other words is an ensemble of various Indian dishes in one plate; a seafood curry, jeera rice, aloo Gobi, daal and salty pakoras lmao. I know salt is a personal preference and all but lmao those were salty pakoras haha. I sound salty just talking about them. Haha no, yeah it's not funny. I don't like over salted food and both the pakoras and papad were really salty for my standards. And on the other hand the masoor daal was undersalted. Lol, but not funny.    I would say the best item from my thali was the aloo Gobi. I'm not gonna break it down and explain what that dish consists of, there is Google for that. But they do make a really nice aloo Gobi compared to a few other places I've tried. Nice thick chunks of gobi in a nice gravy. Now that's one dish I would recommend from Banjara. Good job on that!"}
{"text":"I decided to eat at Banjara after reading all the great reviews the restaurant got however I came away quite dissapointed. My chicken tikka wasn't made in a tandoor and was pan fried. The butter chicken tasted a bit like tomato soup and lacked any flavour. The naan was a pita bread that was heated up. It does have a great location on Eglinton and the staff is really nice and friendly however I'd have to say that this isn't the place to eat at if you know and love Indian food. There are much better options out there including Babur, New Kwality and even Bombay Bhel. 2 stars for the amazing staff."}
{"text":"I suddenly developed a craving for Indian cuisine so after looking for an Indian restaurant within proximity of my area that was well-raved by Yelpers, I chose to order some take-out from Banjara to warm up my soul on a rainy, cold evening. It has been a few years since I last had a good meal of biryani and good homely Indian curry and a some type of naan accompaniment so those were what I included as priorities on my list-to-order. So after looking at the menu and some research on-line, I decided on the Veggie Somosas, Aloo Kulcha, Chicken Biryani, Lamb Rogan Josh and Ras Malai to counter sooth and counter any affects that the spices in the dishes might try to do on my stomach :-)  In the country where I grew up which is a neighbour with India, Indian style curries are just normally just known to the locals as a curry without being given the specific names that they are known by in India and abroad so I really wanted to try a curry that I had never had during my childhood and Rogan Josh was a good choice because of its backstory of being traced by to Person origin. And I also choose lamb because in Canada it seems to be more of delicacy type meat to me because I've never really cooked with it. I'd rather let it be handled by someone who knows how to craftily prepare it into something tasty. Wow, the Rogan Josh with the lamb was just melt-in-my-mouth delicious, the meat was very tender and just feel apart in my mouth. The biryani also had the same soft consistence and the flavor of the lamb combine very well with the spices from the rice and chicken.  The Kulcha stuffed with potatoes was also respectively delicious and of course it would have been best eaten when served right at the restaurant.  I had one of the samosa for breakfast and it was a nice morning delight especially when eaten with small doses of the two chutneys. The mashed up and spiced potatoes inside the dough casing was just good. I'll be enjoying the second one for breakfast tomorrow. The Rasa Malai is something new to me even though that is also available in my home country. The creamy milk sauce that the malais were placed in had just enough sweetness to it without being too strong. And it did help country the spicy after-taste from the main dishes.  Next time, I am going to try some of the vegetarian dishes and a few of the other naan selections at Banjara."}
{"text":"Banjara is the answer to your wildest Indian food cravings! I tend to get take-out rather than dine-in since it is always so packed and tends to be loud, so this review is just about the food rather than the atmosphere or service. Naan is fluffy, HUGE and freshly baked every time, and comes in many flavours. My go-to dishes are baingan bhartha, shrimp dopiazza, and palak paneer - though really, you cannot go wrong with any of the veggie and seafood dishes, in my extensive experience. Well seasoned, with fresh big chunks of veggies and the ideal ratio of sauce. My fav Indian food in all of Toronto, consistently delicious and worthy of my enduring loyalty. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delivery is often very late, typically longer than two hours. Food is great if you can get it."}
{"text":"Every time I walk past this restaurant, I can smell the delicious spices wafting from inside. The food is fantastic and authentic, and the delivery is quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Came to Banjara for dinner during the week. We ordered butter chicken, lamb biryani, aloo Gobi, shrimp pakora and garlic naan. Everything was delicious, portions were good and everytime our water glad was low the waitress would come by quickly to refill it.  The only annoying part of our meal was the flock of 5-6 huddled in a corner. It was great to have attentive service, but I don't like being stared at while I'm trying to eat."}
{"text":"First off, an Indian buffet in this neighbourhood for just $9.99!! Each time I went there, the buffet mostly had the same items.   Appetizers include tandoori chicken, pakodas and papad (or papadum). The papad is not always fresh but when it is I can't stop eating it. Their mango salad is also pretty good.  The main course includes a variety of vegetarian and meat dishes. They have everything from lamb, beef, chicken..you name it. They are also one of the few restaurants to include seafood in their lunch buffet. I especially like their Thai fish. Well, this place does claim to have Indian and Thai. I also love their fried rice which has egg in it and yes, lots of garlic!!  For dessert, they have really good flavours of ice cream. I always go for the coconut or pistachio. They have some exotic flavours like rose falooda. And there is the always popular mango. As for Indian desserts they have kheer and gulab jamuns. To make you feel a bit guilty at the end they have plenty of fresh fruits. Btw, the lunch buffet is just $9.99 on weekends too! If you are not the AYCE type person, try their chicken biryani, it is one of their best a la carte dishes."}
{"text":"Update:  I don't know when they stopped, but when we check out the lunch buffet a month ago, it no longer existed."}
{"text":"friendly attentive service.  we got pilau rice, garlic naan, beef madras, and lamb vindaloo. papadums and mango chutney with two pepsis.  good sized portions, nice flavours, decent prices. all this came to $42.   my boyfriend said it was just \"okay\" and that it all tasted the same, but I thought it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype around this place is. I thought it was just so-so. I had the aloo goba and it tasted like any other Indian restaurant I've been to. Got some stomach issues later."}
{"text":"Live nearby and have dined here with friends family and even bring our baby.   Everyone loves it, except small town folk who consider pepper and salt spicy ethnic seasoning. In other words, take people who will appreciate great non-hamburger food.    The staff is attentive, while the owner keeps an eye on things near cash.   If you go for the first time, you may find the design and decor lacking but once you eat, you'll forget everything that could be wrong.    Made to order, no hot tables.    Enjoy enjoy, the price is right.  We usually get the combo platters, which are a great value with a few items served.  I have a large appetite and it is very filling. Oh, and if you are like me and can take the heat, tell them very spicy!! This review created in 2010, but it was saved as a draft."}
{"text":"I'd give this spot 5/5, if the space were nicer. Too much seating and too blah, to be considered a nice place to sit and dine. However the food is outstanding. You will be hard pressed to find a bette replace to eat, unless you go the original location on Bloor st. The phone rings off the hook, as they get orders going nonstop. Pick what ever you like, ask for your food psycho hot/spicy or just mild, they'll do it all."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian cuisine at great prices. Great portion size. Recommend to dine in or pick up. Delivery is a litttle slow.   4.75/5*"}
{"text":"I am a firm believer that this place has ruined every other Indian food spots for me.  I've been here a few times now...and have found that the service and the food were both excellent. The moment you enter you're greeted and water is brought to you. People check with you ever so often to fill water and to ensure you have all you need.  I always end up having a great time here. Word of caution is that the food tends to be a bit \"spicy\" -although I think that is how it should be. The portions are just enough so that you can share with a friend - which is a handy thing when you're all new to Indian food and are scared to order a whole dis to yourself.  I particularly enjoy the fact that whether you sit outside or inside, you have a sense of privacy - it's dim inside and the tables are well spaced - and from the outside, the restaurant is far enough from the street that you feel removed from the bustle of Bloor street."}
{"text":"Its one of best so far in Indian food. The best part is the meat they have, it is fresh and very tasty. Chicken samosas are a must have. Also if you haven't ordered seekh kebabs you can try the keema naan.Although would have liked the curry to be better. Overall the quality of food and the price makes it a good place to go."}
{"text":"I like my soccer, and as such, I like my beer as well.  And after a find day of both, I like to partake of yet another British tradition, the curry.  The usual suspects of the Indian Rice Factory (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/indian-rice-factory-toronto), Bombay Palace (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bombay-palace-toronto), and well, any place on Gerrard come to mind, but as always I'm looking for newer places to try.  Step forward my buddy who introduced me to Banjara.  The interior is brightly lit with ceiling-to-floor windows that give the place an air of a converted donut shop.  Do not be fooled.  You're ushered in promptly by staff that are as helpful as they are efficient, ensuring that any needs or concerns you have are met   Then there's the food.  Ordering with a pack of people can be a chore, and you have to stand by your guns to ensure that you get the dishes that you want.  To be honest, I could care less what food hits the table so long as we've got Basmati rice and Naan bread dropped off at the table.  II was not disappointed.  As for the other entrees (curried chicken, Alu Gobi, etc etc and so on) every dish came out fast, fresh, hot, and tasty.  Get shot of the donut-shop exterior.  The true Indian flavour is found inside."}
{"text":"I pretty much mirror the sentiments of John I. below. I frequent this place at lunch time for its convenient location, good food, cheap $9.95 buffet, and u can literally walk right in a be eating within ten seconds.  I tend to stay away from the heavy sauced dishes (in total there are roughly 15 things to choose from). There is also a small salad bar with a delicious mango salad. The buffet stations are kept clean and they are refilled once empty.   Because I'm a pussy when it comes to spice, i stay away from the curries and my go to dishes are always the white fish, butter chicken, Palak paneer, stir fried beef and veg, and egg fried rice. Of course naan bread is a good idea (sometimes it is fresher and more moist depending on how long it's been sitting).   The deserts are all delicious I must say. Though I haven't tried the ice creams I'm sure they are all very good standard choices. I usually opt for their yummy rice pudding and sometimes if I'm feeling especially sinful I'll have a couple fried dough balls soaked in honey....mouth orgasm.  I've only been here once for dinner. Although the food is very good I think the better deal is the lunch buffet, and I also enjoy the selection more."}
{"text":"Came with my two lady co-workers for lunch  Enjoyed a pleasant lunch buffet for $9.95 everything was amazing the lamb tikka masala was so tender with generous amounts of lamb. The butter chicken, so creamy and divine I wanted to lick my plate.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I love the goat curry and the butter chicken.. The best!!!! The place is not that fancy, a bit dim, and it is a medium sized restaurant.Authentic Indian restaurant., buzzer at the side of the tables when you need service. Now that is cool!! Good food at a very Affordable price"}
{"text":"TOFoodReviews sums up this place quite nicely,  but of course I will give my 2 cents as well.  I'm no Indian Food expert, but I know what I like.    Things we like to order:  -Butter Chicken (of course...) -Aloo Gobi -Beef Rogan Josh -Pakoras and/or Samosas -Tandoori Chicken -Saffron Rice  You also have the option of going with a \"Quick Combo Platter\" that comes with your choice of a veggie, beef, chicken, beef, goat, lamb, or seafood entree, salad, rice, nann, and dessert.  So you get a little bit of everything for around $10 for lunch, $15 for dinner.  I also see on their web-site that they're doing an AYCE lunch buffet now?  Wish I worked in the area....  What else have they got?  Oh yeah... Nann.  Mmmmmm... Nann.  Love Nann.  And they've got about 5 different types to suit your fancy.  Cheese Nann, anyone?  Why yes. Yes, please.    Also, if you like papadum, you get it free as an appetizer before your meal.  We usually get take-out or delivery, as this place becomes extremely busy during Dinner time. I recommend making a reservation just to be on the safe side.  One perk about getting take-out is the containers they use.  They're great for re-using and the perfect size to store lunches in to bring to work."}
{"text":"Had a meal with the family here. Decor, atmosphere and service were all great... The food however was nothing out of the ordinary. That's not to say it was bad (and the portion sizes were generous), just nothing to 'write home about'. I'd say its a nice little place if you're looking for something low key in the area and you and your companion/s need a curry fix..."}
{"text":"Dinner review only:   So this is a pretty embarrassing story.  We came here on a Thursday night. Originally, we were suppose to go to Copa Cabana which was just next door, however a friend of ours *ackhem* made reservations for the wrong day at that restaurant and we did not want to wait two hours to be seated. We decided to go to Banjura which was just next door and a friend said it wasn't bad so we decided to try it out.     The restaurant was pretty empty (compared to the super crowded restaurant next door) and it seemed quaint. At first, I'm wondering, why is this restaurant empty. It could be because of the competition of other restaurants nearby, but the service and food there was not bad. The waitress was kind enough to accommodate for our friend who was late and served us plenty of water (which was needed!)   The food there was just A-OK. I ordered the butter chicken and it tasted good. Nothing out of the ordinary. The goat was not bad. I was just disappointed to find bones in it. It's not a big deal, but it would've been better if it had no bones, and it wasn't TOO spicy which was great, but the food was salty. It's probably like that for most Indian cuisine though.  It's best to order your meat with rice or naan. The naan tasted better with the food though.   At the end, there was a lot of food leftover! We weren't able to finish it but all in all, it wasn't a bad Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh Indian lunch buffet. Meats are tender in the rich, flavorful sauce. Loved the paneers, butter chicken and chili fish. Cardmom and coconut ice creams are also well-liked."}
{"text":"My neighbour told me about Banjara when they opened up, so we went and reallly liked it. I even told people about it and they liked it too. BUT..it changed..things went blend ( we figured the cook left ) Now it's just another OK indian restaurant"}
{"text":"A friend highly recommended this place and was excited to try it in person. The service was friendly and efficient but also knew when to leave you alone which is a nice balance. I was seated promptly in the glass atrium the moment I walked in, given a papadum as a appetizer to munch on and informed that there was a button underneath the table for whenever I was ready to order. I appreciated being able to wait for the rest of the dinning party comfortably without any pressure.  The lunch or dinner quick combo platters are great because you get to try the Daal curry, Aloogobi, Veggie Pakora and a dish of your choice. It also comes with rice, naan and a bit of rice pudding to end the meal with. I got the Malai Kofta, which were soft moist paneer and potato dumplings in a tomato cream gravy. The assortment of dishes that came with the combo was great, nothing was too spicy but each carried a unique flavor. The butter naan was the perfect medium to pick up all the different choices in front of me. Halfway through the meal, the table next to us got a dish of okra, so I already know what I'm ordering the next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"Cold, stale food. I'm a little sad that this place is in business, and this is the impression Torontonians get of Indian food. This is one case in which I should have listened to the bad reviews."}
{"text":"My favourite Indian restaurant in the city. The dinner feast is great value and quality!"}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday night and order food for take out. The restaurant was very busy and a little too hectic for a nice sit down dinner so I would probably stick to take out.  The food was decent but not mind blowing.  What we ate: - chicken tikka masala (4/5): developed tastes and fresh.  - Daal makhani (3/5): good flavor a little to creamy for my liking - garlic naan (1/5): overkill on the garlic! - pea pulao rice (3/5): pretty fresh but a little overwhelming with the curry dishes  I would give this place one more shot just because my fellow Yelpers seem to love it!"}
{"text":"I won't make this super long. After living in India for over a year before moving to Toronto I have been on the hunt for great Indian food in my new city. Lots of people told me to go to little india and try Lahore Tikka House. While I enjoyed Lahore, I found it super oily and more akin to Pakistani food than Indian.  Banjara is the opposite, very fresh, not crazy oily, and far more Indian. Look, this place is not a 5 star restaurant, so don't go in expecting one. However, the prices are super reasonable, the food is amazing and fresh, and it makes the whole area smell AWESOME!  In particular, I love the Paneer Makhani...I haven't had it that good since a hill station in northern India that still haunts. That meal still haunts my dreams.  Go in with reasonable expectations, and enjoy a nearly authentic Indian meal."}
{"text":"Oops! We had high expectations for Banjara because a friend raved about it, but nope! We ordered the veggie pakoras, onion bhaji, butter chicken, chicken vindaloo, and garlic naan. My husband and I both agreed the food was incredibly bland, which was funny because we asked for a bit of spice. The spices were missing (both in terms of heat and flavour). I think  this restaurant would be perfect for you if you have a low spice tolerance. The food was delivered quickly, so zero problems with the service."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good, but it has kept sliding downhilll for years. Had a crave and got their mixed platter to go (which I've had many times). I asked for plain rice instead of that yellow rice that normally comes with.... But they UPCHARGED me $1 without telling me. Then I get the carton home and nothing's been kept separate. the rice is coating everything, the flavours are muddled.  And, the chicken was dry and I only got a mere 2 pakoras! usually i get 4 or 5.  I do wish more Indian places did combination platters for one of two. I wouldn't recommend this place. If you do, dine IN the restaurant` *(otherwise your food will look like post-mortem dog food), and ask about the price if you want to make a substitution.  Staff are... half friendly, half not.  Maybe the other location cares more... and doesn't leave chicken sitting around getting dried."}
{"text":"Love this place! Whenever I need to satisfy my craving for Indian food, this is my place. I get the butter chicken, baingan bharta, and lamb masala every time. The meat is tender and each dish oh-so flavourful. The naan is soft and fresh and there is nothing like a piece of this drenched in butter chicken sauce. Heaven! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It is a small place with long lines on Friday and Saturday nights, but this is the only part where they lose points. The staff are really friendly and the service is quick. The prices are very reasonable and they give good sized portions, enough for lunch the next day. I feel a craving coming on, I think I know where I'm headed tonight..."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times. The quality and freshness of the food is difficult to beat. The servers are patient and helpful. We ended up getting the Combo Platters for dinner. I had the lamb and boyfriend had the butter chicken. Both were great! Good value for the money - choice of side dishes with rice pudding for dessert. It's not cheap but it is very good."}
{"text":"They were back to their best - best Indian in Toronto    Hey yelp- let me write my review without you editing it."}
{"text":"We got the food delivered and it was awesome. The website advised 60-90 minutes for delivery and they were right. Despite this, the food was great. I liked how you can order online and it's so simple. Next time I'm in the area, I'll try to eat in. Great food."}
{"text":"Loved it. Service was good except for they forgot to bring us our side yoghurt, but not a big deal.  We ordered.. Chicken Pakora, the batter was done really nicely, full of flavour. Garlic Rice (was good, but just okay). Chili Chicken which was impressive and I would recommend it. Lamb Korma was good, the sauce was good and lamb was moist. And of course, the Naan, we got butter and a Keema naan. The butter naan was so delicious, I would recommend just getting a few of those instead. There are some condiments on the table that you can use to top over bread or rice, but to be honest I am not sure what they were, one was a bit sweet and the other was like a yoghurt mint/spinach type thing. Both enjoyable.  Not a huge beer selection on tap but we managed :) This place was packed on the Saturday night we went, and we were lucky to slip in without a reservation and not long of a wait (only 2 of us though). I will be going back to this place, I am excited to try more things and I am already craving their butter naan, so fluffy and satisfying."}
{"text":"This place has amazing Indian food. It's even better when you eat in. Get the vegetarian bryani instead of white rice."}
{"text":"BEST butter chicken in the city. Very different. If you are looking for one of those sugar infested versions of butter chicken, you will be disappointed but if you want a rich, very creamy and flavorful version, you ought to try Banjara's savory butter chicken. You even get to choose the level of spiciness, from mild to hot. I've tried them all and each one is a delight!"}
{"text":"The food was just okay. The atmosphere/service was such that it felt like a fast food joint. The waitress was rushing us through, even thought the place was empty. She didn't ask if we wanted drinks, etc. She had her pen and pad ready like a diner waitress before we even had a chance to review the wine list. It is very un-classy. I wasn't expecting upscale, but I was expecting something a bit more civilized than a diner-like atmosphere. I had high hopes because it's really close to me, but I'll simply venture farther next time."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best curry in Toronto."}
{"text":"South Indian based menu, mostly focused on rice items.  The spice-meter is calibrated a bit different compared to other restaurants. So \"very spicy\" can be a little bit tormenting if you aren't used to Indian hot and spicy dishes.  It's a good place to hangout with friends, especially in the glass covered patio, which is kept pretty warm even in the middle of the winter."}
{"text":"I've been to Banjara several times because the food is consistently good and the price is awesome. The butter chicken and naan are definitely worth trying. Tandoori chicken is good also, very well seasoned. The service for drinks and such can be slow, which is odd because its never usually too busy when I've been there. But the waitress is very nice when she does get around. It picks up at about three so I go before that time in order to beat the crowds. I'll be going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I want more!!!   Ordered Tandoori Cauliflower (got medium because my friend isn't a fan of super spicy), Goat Madras and garlic rice. My friend ordered something vegetarian and I can't remember because I was super fixated on my own delicious meal. Do yourself a favor and get the goat here; it is super tender and satisfying. Our bill came to 45 bucks which isn't awful. The cauliflower was the priciest app on the menu (the other items were around 5 bucks). I will be back."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Staff: Great staff. There's a bell for service but they also check on you every so often.  Ambience: It's a very busy place. We were in the outer area but it was comfortable and still well heated.  Food: I had the Chicken Korma with a side order of Meat Samosas and Garlic Naan. I loved the Chicken Korma, it was nice and filling and very delicious. The Meat Samosas were good too (and very big!). Lastly, the Garlic Naan was nothing special, but it definitely went well with everything.  Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"The dinner combo was a great deal at $14.95. This is less expensive than a typical meal at an Indian restaurant and it came with rice, naan, daal curry, aloo gobi, veggie pakora, rice pudding and choice of meat/veggie dish (of a variety of options)."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place for Indian. Their saucey type dishes are good but I would not recommend the tandoori. It's a bit dry. Overall great price and good service. One thing I do think is awesome and a must have is their garlic naan! It has a lot of garlic!!!"}
{"text":"Dishes I know to be awesome so far are the Kachumber Salad, Aloo Korma and Daal Makhani. The butter Naan and Raita are musts to accompany them and their Rasmalai, if you have room is a fantastic finish.   You think that you've had good Indian food but you haven't had Indian food like this, seriously. The spice combos in their food blew me away, I can't believe I waited this long to try this place. I'd heard about it from at least a half dozen people over the years but just never quite got there but I will be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice authentic feeling because of the decorations and the layout of the restaurant is pretty nice. They have a small area that's kind of like a balcony so it has more privacy. The servers are very nice! They might forget you asked for something sometimes when they are busy but everyone does that once in a while. Still very friendly.   The food is just the right amount of flavours and spice! Portions look small but by the time you're half way there, you're gonna feel like you ordered too much. The prices are very good for what you're ordering. Bill comes out to around $45 when ordering 2 entree, 2 sides of naan bread and a dessert!  We ordered mostly chicken dishes and it seemed like it was all chicken breast, very well cooked and tendered in the sauce. The naan bread is very soft with right amount of crispy too. Chicken briyani (excuse me if I spelled it wrong) and butter chicken."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Banjara Indian Cuisjne.  Parking was tricky as they have an interesting parking lot.  I got a spot.  The service is friendly and fast.  The restaurant is clean.  They were able to serve me food that I could eat which can be tricky as I have to eat gluten free.  It was also very fast.  The menu had several choice with multiple choices of meat.  There were also several vegetable choices.  I ordered the okra, and the lamb roganjosh.  The lamb roganjosh was unlike anything I have had elsewhere.  Very generous in the portions, and large amounts of meat in it.  It was served very different from what I have had elsewhere.I found thought it was full of lots of great ingredients including lots of fresh peppers and onions, it was lacking something.  It also looked like cat food.  The presentation of the dish could use a little tweaking.  The okra was okay, but it was full of leaves that were hard to chew and stuck to my mouth. I ended up picking out the leaves.  It had a very generous amount of ginger, which I really like, but the okra also needed something.  It was a little bland.  I will try this restaurant again on a different day and see if there is a difference.  I've seen this restaurant get some good reviews, so I am assuming that the meal I had today is not typical of their normal food."}
{"text":"Food was cold took almost 2 hours to deliver. Had the non veg thali and could use more spice. I asked for onions sliced and peppers on the side and they wouldn't add it. Really delivering cold food for this price and quality is hardly worth it."}
{"text":"Bah. Good food. Horrible service. That about sums this place up. Went on a Saturday night and we were seated in the non-LLBO section. Was too impatient to wait to get inside. No complaints about that.  But man after we sat down we waited like 20 minutes just to get our order taken. And then it took FOREVER to actually get the food. And it came piecemeal. Annoying.   We found out at the end that there was a button next to the table we were supposed to press if we wanted them to come over. Completely non-obvious to newbs.   The food was good, but not mind-blowingly good. I suppose I would go back if it wasn't a long wait with extremely non-judiciious use of the table button."}
{"text":"After reading some of these reviews, I gotta say I was expected something amazing. However, I was disappointed.  I went to the lunch buffet today. I actually tried a little bit of every dish. Overall, nothing tasted bad, but nothing tasted AMAZING either (except for the aloo gobi and paneer makhani! Which is the cheese in a butter sauce; think butter chicken but with cheese instead).  However there weren't enough good dishes that would warrant a return. In conclusion, it was disappointing."}
{"text":"I had 2 Groupons for this location, but I'd been to the Christie Pits one many times before. I usually get palak paneer or mattar paneer. The food is always delicious and the staff are friendly; I think it's a family-run business because they always seem to have a lot of staff."}
{"text":"I had a yelp day today and chose this place as it was the best reviewed Indian restaurant in Toronto. I have to say that am always amazed at how every Indian restaurant has their own take on classic Indian cuisine. I always order the same thing (chicken tika massaala) and it seems to be different at every place I go to. That being said I just love Banjara's take on my favorite dish. Not to creamy not too spicy...just right. Overall I was very impressed with this place. The menu was pretty comprehensive and not too pricy. The onion bargi and the samosas are definitely worth a try. The d√©cor is a bit shabby and yes it is cramped but then I really do not expect much else when I go out for Indian. Definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"Great food, and taste, the place is a bit depressing !!  Too dark.. not a nice place to eat,, however I would recommend to take the food to go..as they do give more portion.."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! My boyfriend and I go at least twice a month. We fell in love with the butter chicken and their garlic naan. The waiters are always very friendly and helpful. Their take out service is also quite fast. If you want to have good Indian food you must try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the last year.  I have only ordered vindaloo chicken and because I know it's very tasty, I don't want to try other dishes in case it's not as good as the vindaloo.  I ask for it medium spicy and even low sodium once too so they're very accommodating.  For the price, I wish that it came with rice or naan, but it does come with papadum and I usually tell them to exclude it because it doesn't do much for me.  They use to include rice pudding, but one day a new woman said that it doesn't come with it and that they probably made mistakes or were being generous.  I don't like rice pudding so it doesn't affect me, but I do think that they should get their act together on this since it could matter to others and is also misleading.  The ladies whom work the front are quite professional.  However, I wished that they were more chattier with customers and the food can be quite a long wait so it's best to plan a head."}
{"text":"There`s not much to the service or aesthetic  appeal here but the food is just so great. They seem to get it just right as it is usually always packed towards dinner time. It used to have weird hours during the day so I would be sure to double check."}
{"text":"I hosted a vegetarian social through Meetup.com in July 2011 with a dozen people. The staff here is super; they was very accommodating when I had to add additional seats and split the bills between small groups. They were also able to point out vegan dishes for those with dietary restrictions.   What made my visit memorable was the paneer. OH MY GOSH.  I'm normally not a fan, considering most paneer that you find in Toronto is stiff and hard, with barely more flavour than a block of firm tofu. The paneer at Banjera was amazingly fresh, soft and had me craving more! The malai kofta wasn't bad either - creamy and savoury and worth seconds if it weren't so unhealthy!  ACCESSIBILITY/LOCATION: A 5-minute walk east of Eglinton Subway Station. There is a set of short stairs inside the restaurant so it may not be as wheelchair-friendly."}
{"text":"I first went to Banjara 3 years ago and was very impressed, you had to wait 30 minutes before the food showed up. I like that as they prepare the food fresh. I went there recently and was a little disappointed, the food was decent, but we asked for medium and got mild spice. And the food showed up very quickly, I suppose I was there around 6 and they were getting busy. will be checking it out again soon, but worth giving a try, they also have lunch/dinner thali."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! And now especially hidden because of all the LRT construction on Eglinton. But search a little bit and you'll find some deliciousness. There is a sprawling menu of flavourful delights, and an indecisive mind always go to the thalis. We decided on fish curry and tomato eggplant curry as the main currry. If you pick the thalis, be prepared because there will be a lot of yummy food coming your way. The thalis come with rice, naan, several veggie curries such as lentil or mixed veggies and a small dessert. The tomato eggplant was the delight of the evening with the eggplant and tomato melting together and into the potent and flavourful spices. The fish curry came with lots of what looked like salmon. The fish may have been a touch dry, it was flavourful and the sauce made up for any lost moisture. The naan came out piping hot and with a nice char. It was definitely useful for mopping up all the rich sauces. The service was prompt and cheerful, but not as frequent as I'd like. I needed that water to put out some of the fire from the curries!"}
{"text":"This place had amazing authentic North Indian food, especially the butter chicken and samosas. They had beer from India on tap which gave the place an additional authentic touch. Overall we had a great experience there. The staff was extremely friendly. Rocky, the manager even brought us some free snacks while we waited for our take out food. We spoke to the owner who was a very friendly person. I highly recommend this place if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Tried Banjara again. Curries are still delicious but the naan left something to be desired. A friend from out of town said that it was chewy and room-temperature.   Considering my last yelp review said the same thing, I consider this a trend and a concern."}
{"text":"Solid Indian food at reasonable prices, and bonus free parking.  After years I wanting to check out Banjara, I finally did a couple weekends ago. They have free parking in the front along Bloor (a rarity in Toronto for sure). It might be hard to get a spot during dinner time, but we luckily nabbed one of the last spots. In the restaurant we sat in the space in the front, which has a lot of natural light, and you are close enough to the other tables to spy on what they are eating.  Based on reviews I had read, and just what I like to eat, we ordered four of the different curries. The chicken tikka, the mushroom curry, the palak paneer, and the malai kofta. My favourite of the four was the chicken masala, and not only because it was the only meat dish, but was just the yummiest. The sauce of the malai kofta was pretty great though. I would recommend trying all four though.  We ate all of the food in front of us, and there was no leftovers. I will probably be back, and next time I might do take out and try a few different curries."}
{"text":"More realistically a 3.5, but I rounded up. Came here for dinner on a Friday night and while the restaurant was busy, as others have said, it's quite large, so there were still several free tables. Lots of different options on the menu, but as my boyfriend and I are both veg, I got the Aloo Gobi and he had the Aloo Korma. One thing to note is that rice does not come with the dishes - you have to order it on the side. $3.25 initially seemed a tad expensive for a single order of rice, but it was large enough for us to share, so no complaints there. The food was pretty good - I personally found my dish to be a touch drier than I would have liked and my boyfriend said he'd had better Aloo Korma in the past, but overall it was still an enjoyable dining experience and we'll likely be back."}
{"text":"Ever since Nataraj closed, I've been on the lookout for a good Indian place. Time and time again, Banjara comes up as one of the best in the city. I hope it isn't true. The food has no flavour and is way too oily, and the naan is not memorable at all. Why do people like this place so much?"}
{"text":"Butter chicken always hits the spot. Tandoori cauliflower is amazing, so are the other sizzlers (tandoori chicken). Extra spicy option might be a little bit too much to handle for some (info tip). Naans are authentic and delivered fresh and hot. I asked for extra papadums instead of the rice pudding, and they kindly included both regardless. Whenever dining in, I always received courteous service and the servers were very attentive. Keep up he good work!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. I really enjoy the goat curry, I always opt to get the platter meals   The portions are generous but it is the quality of the food that have me coming back again and again.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"YOU NEED TO GET THE CHEESE NAAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  One of my favourite cuisines..this place did not disappoint. Got here at almost 9pm on a Saturday and it was full. Good sign. We waited at the bar area, where we got a Cheetah.   The wait was less than 5 minutes and we were seated. We ordered Cheese Naan, Butter Chicken, Tandoori Prawn, and Rogan Josh Beef. The Cheese Naan is amazing, especially after its dipped into curry - the cheese almost melts in your mouth with the creaminess of the curry. Butter Chicken was mind blowing, Rogan Josh Beef was tender. The Tandoori Prawn wasn't too bad either, wished it was a bit more spiced though. Portions looked tiny but just like all Indian dishes, they are on the heavy side.   Our server told us to press the button on the wall whenever we needed something. Seems like the button did not work? I tried the \"press and wait\" method, also the \"press 935232432 times in a second\" approach and neither got any servers' attention. So in the end we just gave up on the button and waved our hands. We asked for the bill and it seemed like our server forgot.  Food is definitley a 5 star, they can have better service for sure."}
{"text":"Indian food is funny. It always insights three major decisions:   1. F I'm white, I forgot to tell them \"hey, I'm not white on the inside.\"  2. Naan or rice? No, naan and rice, but damnit I hate the bill when I see it charged.  3. How come in Indian food terms... two entrees is never enough? It's always two meats & a side entree to share. It always turns out perfect, which is why I hold it too a higher level in my dining out than the ol' Canadian (New) of single entrees and fried appetizers.   The passing of entrees... the sharing of left overs. The eating with hands with shared naan. It takes on its own/better way of dining.   Damn do I dislike tablecloths and rooms without music, and that's what we have here. I'll never get over how much I don't like it and I'll never get over how anywhere I've traveled with an Indian restaurant comes this.   And ghee, this food is heavy. The standard three entree situation is not necessary. Leftovers can happen with two, and one entree with naan is honestly enough food. If there's one entree to get... it's mater paneer. Or, maybe, the lamb vindaloo. Okay, just get both. The butter chicken is like biting a stick of butter like a candy bar. Don't do it.   I blew their minds with asking for ice with the masala chai. They brought out a bowl of ice with a spoon. Once they witnessed my genius on this hot day, they brought out more. Thank you."}
{"text":"Considering Banjara is the top rated Indian restaurant on Yelp Toronto, our expectations were high. To my delight, they had a combo/Thali meal, which includes an entree, a bunch of side dishes, naan, and rice.  This is all priced at like $11, which is unbelievable.  The chana masala was probably the best thing we ate - it was garlicky in the best of ways.  The palak paneer was a bit unorthodox, as far as my experience goes at least, but it was fine.  The side dishes (including the pakoras), however, were all just luke warm, which is not the most appetizing. The samosas were very tasty, though.  Service was a little confusing, in that you have to push a button on the wall next to your table to get a server to come by.  Perhaps it is intuitive, but we sat there like idiots for quite a while before someone told us..."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best indian food in the city!   The butter chicken is very tasty. Spice level hits the sweet spot of spicy enough without scalding, and encompasses the flavor the butter, tomato, fenugreek leaves etc. The chicken, on the regular is cooked quite well, without being dry! As for leftovers (if there's any!) The consistency maintains itself (as opposed to getting that weird separation  that some sauce can)  My personal favorite: the mutter paneer! This is amazing!  By far the best in city!  It is flavorful and creamy! There are enough peas that is filling but not so many that you're worried about not having enough sauce. The paneer is firm on the outside and soft on the inside,and tastes wonderful!  If in doubt...do it.   The Naan is great too! It's never burned, and always great!"}
{"text":"Long wait unjustified for cold, mediocre food in an unsanitary space. Worst service in memory. The restrooms are disgusting and rotting flowers not bothered to be changed. Unkempt waitress. Lacking pride in food. Need to revisit why so many seem to have loved them. Not up to snuff."}
{"text":"Definitely the best indian food in toronto.. we have been coming here for over a yeat now and have never been disappointed.. the place is always oaxked, but the service is top notch ALWAYS! Must eat here if you are an indian food fan, honestly even if you aren't.. you will be blown away!"}
{"text":"I love this place - a really great local Indian place. I think we've ordered from Banjara 20+ times over the years. What I love about this place is that all of the food tastes different. You know the Indian places where EVERY curry tastes the same?  Well this is not that pace. Naan is great, veg and meat dishes are top notch.  I would skip the samosa not their best piece of work. Curries, tandoori, lentils etc are all great.   I've only ever got delivery so no comment on service or the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"Banjara is my favourite Indian restaurant this side of Little India. I generally try to eat vegetarian and there are lots of excellent veggy options on the menu here. Anything I've tried has been good but I'm particularly fond of Mater Paneer, Palak Paneer, and Chana Masala. All are rich, flavourful, and have just the right amount of spiciness. Despite costing almost twice as much as normal naan, I usually opt for one of the stuffed breads like Aloo Kulcha - It's definitely worth it. Also, the mango lassi is a must have.  The only possible concern I can think of is that the food at Banjara is very rich, but this is to be expected from this type of cuisine, so I don't hold it against them. I have taken some people here who found the amount of oil and cream to be too much. This probably isn't the place to eat if you're on a diet...  I always get take out so I can't comment on the dine-in experience."}
{"text":"I went here this weekend with my partner on a Saturday night without reservations.   Disclaimer: both my partner and I are of Indian decent and we eat a lot of Indian food on the regular so our standards/expectations are quite high. Also we prefer a certain level of spice for our indian food. Please keep this in mind when interpreting this review.  Environment: on a Saturday night it is very busy and if you show up without a reservation you can expect a wait. They are not very accurate with their estimates of time. We were told 20 and it was closer to 45. The environment is low key. Not much for decor. Seats and tables are close together. There is no music (probably a good thing) however due to the crowd it can be quite loud. Not an ideal place for an intimate date night.   Food: I ordered a chicken quick combo which came with chicken madras, Nan,  rice, rice pudding, aloo gobi and veggie pakoras for about 15. My partner got the same thing but veggie with paneer makhani. We ordered medium spicy. Our food came quickly since we ordered prior. Both orders were quite mild by our indian standards (so if you prefer spicy order spicy explicitly). Overall the food was ok nothing special as far as indian restaurants go.  Service: staff was friendly but overwhelmed with customers and orders. However if you order your food before you are seated your food can be available for you as soon as you sit down which is nice. Aside from when the food was given to us we did not see our server at all (not even for water refill until the end).  That said, this place is decent. It's very busy so some people do like it alot but for us it didn't meet the cut."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here twice and I'm never disappointed. Best Indian buffet for the price 10.99."}
{"text":"Delivery from a fairly close address was painfully difficult. They don't take debit, and they wanted me to wait an hour and forty minutes, terrible customer service on the line with no conveniences."}
{"text":"banjara is the best. banjara gets it. i love banjara.   the $30 minimum for delivery succcccks but whatever that's my own fault for being lazy and not walking the 15 min each way for pickup. banjaaraa yaaaaallll.   guess who signed up for dat banjara vip email list? this homie right here. hells yes. banjara vip 4 lyf.  naaaaaan breeeaaad 4 evvvaaaa   * sorry everyone i just ordered some fine and delicious banjara cuisine for delivery and i'm so excited for it's arrival"}
{"text":"So I found this place on Yelp while I was looking for Indian restaurants, and looking at how popular and highly rated this place was, I decided to come here for dinner with a friend.  The service was decent, however, some of our dinnerwares and glass was dirty, a big NO NO and turn off at a restaurant :(  We ordered the beef curry, tandoori chicken (half), and some garlic naan on the side. The beef curry tasted quite good, and the meat was cooked perfectly where it easily falls apart. The tandoori chicken was also marinated well and tasted good. However, the garlic naan had too much butter to which I didn't like.  Overall, 2 stars because the food at this place is pretty good if you are looking for some Indian food, not sure about the authenticity though. But they need to do a better job on cleaning their dishes, wouldn't be happy to see dirty dishes again if I decide to come here again."}
{"text":"Going to keep this one short and sweet.  Been here several times.  Food is always delicious, excellent service, and portions generous.  Banjara is considered to have one of the best Butter Chicken dishes in the city according to BlogTO....and me :D I often come here with a vegetarian who loves what they have to offer as well.  If you've got a craving for good indian food that won't break the bank, this is a MUST TRY!!  *edit* If you have the option of either dining in, or taking out.  TAKE-OUT GENERALLY HAS LARGER PORTIONS!  Just a heads up."}
{"text":"Now that I've been out on the town, I'd rather go with two stars cuz: Meh. I HAVE experienced better. But for its price point, it's pretty decent. Don't understand the fuss about it though."}
{"text":"Came here with two of my friends and we had the butter chicken, aloo gobi and palak paneer. All three dishes were good but what stood out was the butter chicken. It was slightly spicy and I usually cannot eat anything too spicy but this had the perfect kick to it. It was so good that I couldn't stop dipping my butter naan into the sauce even when I was already full.   Location is also very convenient with some parking just outside or on the side street. This place is just a few steps away from Christie station."}
{"text":"Indian Food yum!!! I would score it more a 3.5 only because I have had the best indian food elsewhere.  Proceeding with my comment about this place though...  For $12.95, you get all sorts of goodness on your plate.  It is quite a surprise when it came to my table.  Its good to find indian food close to work that I can now go to.  I ordered the butter chicken lunch combo.  The butter chicken is tasty, so is the aloo ghobi, and the naan bread is good, the pakoras not so much.  I have had WAY better.  I left it on my plate.  Nice waitress.  Ok looking place.  There's actually parking spots which makes it convenient to go there.   I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm no expert at Indian food but I know a few people who claim they are, so I found my way to Banjara on a recommendation and have since revisited several times.  When you first walk in and cut your way through the wall of spice and aroma, you'll notice the awkward setup reminiscent of a past burger joint.  Every occasion usually results in us waiting for about 5 or 10 minutes (not referencing Seinfeld here, going literal now) but we're always quickly served a pint by attentive staff which subdues any mood from having to stand and wait.  I will admit that I will base my entire experience and any recommendation solely on the holy grail of Indian food, the butter chicken. There are very few foods that I have the urge to smother over my body but this would be one of them. From the moment the spices burn through my nostrils to my tongue wrapping around a piece of chicken, the experience can be described as flawless. A perfect combination of creamy sweet tandoori and savoury bliss that makes my eyes roll back into my head. The old adjective saying \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" applies here as we always order the same thing. The chana masala and palak paneer are excellent choices and a perfect compliment to the the most excellent naan.  In addition to the superb food, you can expect hardy size portions, decent prices and a friendly staff.  Accompanied by a lively atmosphere where everyone always appears to be enjoying themselves  helps complete the experience.  On a concluding note, if you happen to think there is better butter chicken in TO, please locate the 'send message' link and enlighten me. However, if I find myself in disagreement, I won't be the one smothered in creamy butter chicken ;)"}
{"text":"Our go to indian place when we are not whipping our own at home. This place gets really packed during the nights and weekends. Parking can be a bit difficult at that time. So we generally get it to go and head home or have it at Christie pits park during the summers.  Food: The famous butter chicken is on top of my list with their garlic naan! Goat curry and korma are good too. Palak paneer (spinach and cheese) and kofta (dumplings) for the veggies are our go to.  Service: I guess it depends on who gets to serve you. Most of the time they are really enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but sometimes there will always be that one person who probably was not having a good day...yup. Wait times average 15-20 during dinner time."}
{"text":"Meh. Butter chicken was ok. Some of the veggies dishes and the rice all had the same odd taste. I'd opt for Kings Palace for Indian over this place any day. Garlic naan was good though but not as soft and fresh as it could be."}
{"text":"Went here for takeout. The place was dead so I was kind of hesitant at first but glad I went through with it!  The people working there were very friendly and helpful. Three people were helping me decide what to order for takeout, which was nice of everyone.  I ended up getting the butter chicken dinner combo. It includes butter chicken, some cauliflower thing (aloo gobi?), a dahl curry, pakora, rice and naan. It also comes with papadam and a rice pudding dessert. So much food for around $16.  Everything was pretty good but the butter chicken was by far the best part. Next time I go I'm gonna get a thing of butter chicken for sure. The other things were ok but the butter chicken was great. The naan was also a good one too. They know what they're doing here.  Great service, great butter chicken... Great flavour, great value... I'll definitely be back for takeout. Some of the best Indian in the city."}
{"text":"Besides the remnants of it's counter-service past, the first thing you are greeted by when you enter the doors of Banjara is the mouthwatering, pungent smells of rich spices. Welcome to a seriously tasty Northern Indian culinary experience.  The room, full of clusters of small tables was absolutely packed when we walked in. Our makeshift table for four was puzzle-pieced together with two differently sized two-tops and one of my friends sharing a curiously two sided floating banquette with someone from a neighbouring table.  The food was excellent. The dishes we sampled from the flavourful mater paneer ($8.99), juicy chunks of chicken tikka ($10.99) that arrived on a theatrical sizzling hot plate, chicken in smooth thick saag ($9.99) and jumbo shashi shrimp ($12.95) were all delicious and served in generous proportions. The extremely moist peas pulao, fluffy plain basmati, roti, and butter naan were all great accompaniments too.   There was a really large staff on hand who seemed to enjoy standing in a row behind the counter, watching the happy diners. The service was incredibly friendly with orders sent immediately via PDA and constant water refills.  Although the intricate and brilliantly coloured Indian art on the walls and bright fabric panels covering the condensation covered windows provide distraction for the eyes, a little upgrade on the decor certainly wouldn't hurt Banjara."}
{"text":"Regular food, awful service. We ordered around 8 items, which is quite a bit for five people. Even though we were spending quite a bit of money there WITH reservations, they were constantly trying to rush us out. Halfway through the meal, they would come up to us and ask us if we wanted to pack it up. We said no, we are still eating. And they came up to us a few more times after that WHILE we were still eating! If you want their food, get take out, they will prefer it."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times now.  Their menu has a lot to choose from so it's difficult to write a complete review without having tried 90% of the menu.  However, I can say that the veg potato (aloo) and spinach (banji) curries were excellent.  Some of the other dishes ordered at our table included the chicken tikka masala and lamb biryani.  Our party did enjoy these dishes as well but it should be noted that some thought there were better restaurants in town that did a better job preparing those same dishes.   Overall tho a very positive experience and I am looking forward to trying other dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"Got the butter chicken and lamb Rogan Josh.  Excellent service and food quality.  The best Indian restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"This place was very highly recommended, and it fell short of that mark for me. I got one of the platters, and the food wasn't very hot, as in temperature. I would try a different place for Indian next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know where the negative reviews are coming from in regards to the service, but more about that later. The food here is excellent, the restaurant itself is clean and modern and the service levels were excellent. They also will custom your orders too (mild, spicy, extra spicy) The bread is fresh and my favourite was the beef curry :)"}
{"text":"Perfect food, awesome service, great price! Definitely give it a try, you will return no without a doubt.   PS: If don't like spices, obviously Indian food is not the right choice for you."}
{"text":"I downloaded the Yelp App and made an account purely to do this review.   The service here is TERRIBLE.   I went here my first time 4 years ago as a total newb to Indian food, looking to try something new. When I told them I hadn't tried this type of food before and would love their suggestions on what to try, I got blank stares and scoffs. I vowed to never go here again.   Fast forward to this year, and my wife insists that I'm just bad at ordering food, and am probably exaggerating about the bad service. So I break my vow and say we can give it another go (I went alone the first time). Sure enough, we go to the restaurant to sit down and eat, and the service is exactly the same. Blank stares, scoffs at the both of us, and when we were full and just chatting, one of the waitresses came over and very rudely asked if something was wrong (presumably because we weren't eating anymore).   My wife agreed that the service was horrible, but we like the food well enough. Turns out the do take out, so we said to ourselves we'd do that from now on.   Tonight they even fucked that up.   We get there and say we want to order take out, and the girl takes us to the bar to look at menus, and proceeds to look at her phone. We already know what we want, so I try to get her attention. \"So do we just tell you what we want, or...?\" Nothing. \"Excuse me?\" I say, and that seemed to wake her up from the phone trance, and finally we get to order our food.   From now on, we're going to use Just Eat, and/or try to find a more friendly Indian place in the area. Three strikes and they blew it as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Very savoury and fairly priced Indian food. The Butter Chicken was great and I strongly recommend the Beef Korma. Whatever you order will go well with their tasty butter naan and garlic rice. They also have a $9.99 all-you-can-eat lunch buffet with some good variety."}
{"text":"Super good. Ordered a chicken korma combo at dinner - came with potato curry, Dahl, rice, pakora, naan, papadam, and rice pudding. 14.99 for dinner and it was a HUGE portion. Everything was fresh - good spice. Really really recommend it. Service was quick- and they had my take out order made and packed up in under 10 minutes. This is my Indian spot from now on!"}
{"text":"I don't usually eat Indian food but when I do, I go to Banjara! They have one of the best lamb dishes~"}
{"text":"Very popular restaurant with a enclosed patio. Our table had a button to press to alert the servers but servers came by often enough refilling everyone's water so we never had to use it. Butter chicken was okay, a bit dry, and wasn't as spicy as I was expecting it to be. Naan came with way too much butter and a bit on the expensive side as well."}
{"text":"Holy thermal underwear, Batman! This place is AWESOME!  I have been a couple times before, but I revisited today and it was just a zillion times better than I remembered from a few years ago.  The patio is great, I don't know many Indian places that have a patio!  We walked over through Christie Pitts, you can start to smell all the aromatic spice goodness from about 50 meters away.  One thing I noticed was that the service here has really been stepped up a notch. They had many servers on hand and everyone was extremely prompt and polite. Water was refilled numerous times.  The portions are pretty huge for indian food. We were starving (3 of us) and we ended up taking half our food home because we ordered too much.   I tried the Tandoori Chicken Tikka - excellent, huge portion (about 12oz chicken! all white meat). We also ordered a chicken korma, a chicken tikka masala (chicken overload!) and a mushroom curry dish which were all super tasty.  They asked how spicy we wanted each dish prepared (mild, medium or spicy) which is useful as my mom has extremely low tolerance to spicy foods.  The naan breads here are GIANT. Only $1.95 each so we ordered 1 each and couldn't finish them.  4 entrees, naan, rice and 2 beer came to $65, not bad at all considering I have enough food in the fridge to feed me for 3 days."}
{"text":"Great prices, really delicious food. I think I'd bring my Indian family here and they'd be just as impressed. The neighbour is a little rundown in this area and seems sketchy, but maybe I'm just too elite now...But obviously this isn't accounted for in the review. I do think the restaurant could use a little makeover though.  I really enjoyed my Paneer Makhani and I thought getting the dinner platter was a good deal, considering the mains don't come with rice.  Service however, was weird. They have these buttons near each table that I guess you can use to call for service, but I found the servers were super vigilant and sometimes a little intrusive. We were asked if we were finished...while my guy was still eating. I also don't understand why they have to take the order via their phone because it seems like they're texting. Or maybe the server was...who knows?  I'd come back here if my guy ever had an Indian food craving again. I don't get those cravings since...y'know...I'm Indian."}
{"text":"This review is for the Banjara lunch buffet! I have tried the buffet at this location at least twice and have been pleased with the food both times. The available items are your typical Indian buffet fair with the lamb curry, and tandoori chicken serving as the highlights. The butter chicken, and naan also make the grade, but the only veggie option I enjoyed besides the mango salad was the Paneer which was better than most I have tried thus far. In addition to the typical Indian fair, Banjara offers a few East Asian items including ginger beef, stir fried chicken, along with noodles or fried rice. I would personally stick to the Indian options and save room for dessert. Coconut icecream, rice pudding, and honey balls (gulab jamun?) were better than expected, but I was not a big fan of the rosewater ice cream!  The restaurant does just ok in terms of cleanliness, and although they are somewhat understaffed during lunchtime, and it took a while to pay, the buffet was almost always full with items!  Disclaimer: I am not as gluttonous as this review may suggest!"}
{"text":"Banjara is somewhat of a Toronto staple. I've found myself coming to this spot almost every time a friend has a craving for Indian food. For several years, the prospect of the trip to the Christie Pits landmark would genuinely excite me, but hit has not been the case as of late. While the food is still OK, I no longer can find a particularly good reason for making the trek.   The service was OK, though we did feel a bit rushed. Our group was seated next to the poorly ventilated kitchen and the smaller tables that were merged to seat us were comically different in size and misaligned. Though we tried a myriad of dishes, the butter chicken was the only one that tasted above average. The naans were also still tasty but I expect more than the bread to be on point when I visit the restaurant.   Overall, Banjara remains a standard choice for Indian cuisine, but may need to rediscover some inspiration if they wish to keep hold of the regulars."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a dinner, food is great, service is outstanding. Strongly recommend to check this place out."}
{"text":"We got take out from Banjara and we were very pleased. The food was tasty and very plentiful!  I find that many Indian restaurants offer very small portions, but not this place. The prices were reasonable too. Theirs is the type of Indian food that is \"street style\" and is heavy on the sauce. They remind me a little of the Pakistani restaurant Lahore Tikka House (which is quite compliment, as I'm a big fan of LTH.)  If you're looking for more refined Indian food, you may want to try the Host, Babur or Pukka.    They have their own website for ordering and it's very easy to use - even grandma can do it. You can specify the amount of spice you want on each dish individually. They do require 60-90 minutes for delivery, but they were nice enough to deliver all the way to Eglinton for us. Here's a description of what we ordered:  Tandoori Chicken - full  Price: 17.99 Rate: 4/5 Nice tandoori, but a bit heavy on the spice rub, a bit too salty and a bit dry.  Seekh Kebab Price: 12.50 Rate: 3/5 As far as Seekh kebabs go, it was only average. It was a little salty, and unbalanced in flavor. The consistency of the minced meat was a little mushy.  Butter Chicken Price: 12.99 Rate: 4/5 The sauce was very nice, but the chicken itself was a bit dry.  Chicken Curry Price: 11.99 Rate: 5/5 Very nice dish. Meat was nice and moist.  Daal with Spinach Price: 10:50 Rate: 2/5 This wasn't my favorite dish. It was a little watery and a little bitter.  Chana Masala Price: 9.95 Rate: 5/5 Very tasty dish. The beans were cooked perfectly.  Butter Naan Price: 2.50 Rate: 4/5 Very large naan, nicely charred from the tandoori oven. It was tasty, but a bit too dense."}
{"text":"My favourite Indian food in the city Aloo gobi Beef masala Butter chicken Garlic naan and rice  Good times!!"}
{"text":"I'd like to share a theory with my fellow Yelpers:   The dirtier the bathrooms in an Indian restaurant, the better the food.   Banjara's bathrooms are gross. But boyyyy is the food good! If you're looking for a moderately priced place with decent service; i.e., you're just in it for the food - go here!  Order tons, eat lots, and enjoy the patio. :-)"}
{"text":"Within the Annex neighbourhood, Banjara is among the better Indian cuisine restaurants. The curries are typically good, and quite large portions... you can definitely share 1 order between 2 (maybe even 3) people.  They seem to always be busy, so if you are doing take-out or delivery, order well in advance. I had a delivery order take close to 2 hours the other day, and the items all arrived a mediocre \"warm\".... disappointing after such a long wait.  We have tried their kormas, masalas, vindaloos, etc... never been disappointed with a curry. Their raita is quite watery, and I prefer a much thicker raita... but that is my personal preference. The naan's are usually quite fresh as well.  Overall, it's decent food... I would say, a bit overpriced though. A meal for 2 usually runs near $50.... which is pretty expensive for take-out."}
{"text":"If you are like me and love Indian food, this place is your \"go to\" when in Toronto.  A quick Lyft ride from Union Station, this place was bustling with servers and diners of all shapes and sizes. The food was excellent - and they give you plenty of it! So much so that we took some away, and it heated up later that night to original perfection!  The saag paneer, dal lentils, and chicken tikka masala were terrific as was the service."}
{"text":"Food was passable, not very authentic-Indian.  Friendly servers, decent location, clean place."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer of Banjara for years. I typically order from the Bloor and Christie location, but due to the fire my order was re-routed to Yonge and eglinton.   I absolutely love the food here and it's the reason I keep coming back. However, in my recent order the delivery took THREE HOURS to arrive! I completely understand that they are scrambling to serve customers due to the fire, but nowhere in the ordering process did anyone manage expectations about the delivery time being double their advertised time (60-90 minutes). When the food finally arrived at 10pm, it wasn't up to the usual standards, the salad was completely wilted and looked like it had been sitting around for far too long. Also the portions seemed smaller than normal and everything was starting to get cold.   When I called the restaurant I got a half assed apology and no apology from the delivery driver.   Banjara, your customers will give you some slack due to the fire. But please make sure you are managing expectations along the way."}
{"text":"I had originally given this four stars, but the last two times I went for dinner, the food and service were terrible. Don't know what's happened to them because their food used to be good.  Firstly it was taking us ages to get noticed whenever we wanted something. On top of that, the chicken dish was almost below average and the meat samosas were dreadful! The samosas were reeking of mustard oil and the meat in it was bland. Thankfully they took it back and did not bill us for it.  We will think many times before going here again."}
{"text":"Visited this awesome place for my friends birthday. The ambience was great and the food was hot and delicious. The quantity served was good for the price we paid. It was quiet for a Sunday afternoon and we were served promptly. The fish pakoras , tandoori chicken and biryani were a major hit amongst our group. It is a bit pricey for naans and parathas but the overall quality is great!"}
{"text":"You better order quick otherwise the aroma of these spices will leave you no room for those DELICIOUS dishes!   Walked into the restaurant for dinner and we got seated right away! Once we were seated our server brought over water and a complimentary snack; 3 pieces of pita-size crackers baked with fennel seeds, yum! She notified us about the service button for when we were ready to order. Service here is prompt just the way I like it!  We ordered the Butter Chicken (since it was recommended by many yelpers!), Pulao and Cauliflower Pakora. The Butter Chicken was served in a small circular pot; didn't anticipate it to be such a small portion but, there is the option to upsize! Chicken was kind of dry however, the creamy sauce complimented it and it also went well with the Pulao. The Pulao is cooked with various spices already and it's just as tasty on its own. As for the Cauliflowrr Pakora, I was not much of a fan. It's pretty much like tempura you'd get at a Japanese restaurant however, fried with a chickpea batter. I found it to be quite dry but, hey, if you enjoy cauliflower and chickpea then this is the appetizer for you!   The goodness of this place does not stop here. Another AMAZING thing about this place is that it's affordable. When the bill came we were surprised to find the total to be around $23! Pulao for only $3.50?!?!  And the Cauliflower Pakora was around 4 bucks..?!(Even though the price of cauliflower nowadays has skyrocketed!) The most expensive item we had was the Butter Chicken, it was around $13 but even then, it's all worth it! Both of us shared the items and it was plentiful BUT, if you're a big eater then sharing won't do you well.   Definitely will return to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from Banjara, so can't comment on the service/ambiance of the restaurant itself.   I found that the veggie samosas were bland and underseasoned, whereas the papadum were way too salty. Garlic naan was loaded with garlic and decent enough. The chana masala and the eggplant bharta were on par with what I've had at other Indian restaurants. Agree with other reviewers that the medium hot is quite spicy enough for those with a penchant for spicy foods.   After eating our meal, both my boyfriend and I felt a bit ill and extremely thirsty afterwards, almost like an MSG reaction. I'm assuming it was from the saltiness of the papadum, but I don't think I would order from Banjara again."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant deserves better rating than what we currently see as an aggregate. The food tasted closer to authentic Indian flavors. Prices were also very reasonable and we were well taken care of. Thank you for an amazing lunch!"}
{"text":"The quality of food at Banjara's is in serious decline. I've tried ordering through just-eat as well as eating in person as recently as this week with the hope of getting a fresher and tastier experience. Not happening.   The platters have gotten so stale.  The indoor seating is dark and dingy with no air circulation, but  The service worsens if you dare sit on the patio. Such a shame.  I also noticed the prices differ at different locations and from the online v. in-person menu. Eek.  I RECOMMEND- Checking out the Banjara at Christie and Bloor.   EXTRA TIP- Everything at the Yeglinton location has become extremely mild so if you must, always order one-up in terms of heat"}
{"text":"The staffs for sure are nice and friendly! I didn't feel awkward at all even dining alone here on a Saturday evening.  Dinner Combo Butter Chicken ($12.95) has so much food that ended up the only regret for the night is I wish I can share that with someone? Naan bread was so fluffy and oven fresh hot!  Waitress asked me how spicy I would like, but ended up Indian spicy is NOT real Indian spicy! When will people believe that I can handle the real deal?  Decoration is minimal but clean and functional.... great for a quick bite with friends but not somewhere you want to impress your date!!  Accepts Visa and Mastercard but not AMEX.  Lunch specials for $9.99 sounded like a good deal!"}
{"text":"2.5 star  I feel really bad about giving Banjara Indian Cuisine such a low rating.   The service here is so good!! The wait staffs are super nice and friendly. 4 star  But.... the food... something is really lacking with the food.  Cheetah Draft ($6.95) was really refreshing and has a hint of sweetness which I enjoyed. The freshly made Naan ($2.49) was warm and fluffy, love that!! 4 star  But the rest of the food we ordered were just MEH..... 2 star  Onion Bhajia ($3.95) - bland... I don't even taste the onion and quite doughy Chilli Chicken  ($11.95) - Sweet and Sour Chicken? The chicken so dry Rogan Josh Lamb ($11.95) - one of the better dish with chunks of lamb but with no spiciness Aloo Gobi ($9.50) - tons of vegetables nicely cooked with good flavour Mater Paneer ($9.99) - my Yelp friend kept spooning these onto my plate... I wondering maybe he didn't like it? Garlic Naan ($3.95) - definitely on the pricey side!!  Mango Lassi ($3.75) - really thick and served with a thin straw, start sucking  I found most of the food that served were lurk warm... so not hot and spicy and not hot hot... I was disappointed!  Maybe I would come back because of the great service? But definitely not for the food!"}
{"text":"I love the flavours and the quality of the meat. I've tried a number of dishes and liked them all. Great portions too."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Banjara since it was Mr. Maharaja downtown more than 15 years ago. I followed them to the current location at Bloor and Christie and was happy to discover this second location when I moved uptown several years ago.  The food has stayed at the same excellent level throughout. This is our go-to North Indian option and have introduced several out of towners as well. The butter chicken is the best in Toronto. We also usually get Shahi shrimp (the kids love it), beef vindaloo, chili chicken, aloo gobi, palak paneer, and daal. The poori, fried with whole wheat flour, is oily but incredible.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in town. Mouth watering butter chicken and enough food to last you several meals with one order. I've only done take out but I've driven in a snow storm just to pick up food from there it's that good."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off day for them but when we got there the service was slow. For a table of 6 there were only two menus on our table. We had to get extra ones from another table. Slow to take our order as well. Food took a while to get there. And when it did, I found that everything on my combo platter, except for the rice and rice pudding, was really salty. Very disappointed. I had such high hopes because of what I've read on yelp. The upside is the servers were pleasant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! They had a very large and attentive staff for a Tuesday night and this place was packed! The tables are a bit tight, but it wasn't uncomfortable. I got the butter chicken dinner platter combo which was a little under $15 for about two meals worth of food. Overall great place!"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service, and restaurant is extremely crowded, stuffy, and loud. Not exactly how I wanna eat my food. Especially when I'm yelling in attempt to communicate with the person sitting 2 feet in front of me.  Oh and your clothes need to be washed to get the smell out when you get home."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great service. Had the butter chicken and the a chicken Madras ?? Lol I forgot the spelling, but nevertheless it was great :)"}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite Indian restaurant - their paneer makhani was irresistible. However the last two times I've ordered from here, both in the past month, the quality has been lower and the gravy recipe changed drastically enough to notice. On the previous order we had the butter chicken and samosas. The samosas were dry and the butter chicken tasted very different from usually. I thought it was just an off-day as we order from here once every month or two and this had never happened before. I was embarrassed that I'd recommended this \"best butter chicken in Toronto\" to my friend that day and he couldn't even finish the dish, but figured it was a bad day for the kitchen or something.  The second time, I experienced similar problems. I had the paneer makhani, my favourite, and the paneer pieces were half their usual size with fewer pieces. There were randomly peas in the gravy. The spices were also a different ratio from usual, altering the taste. The garlic rice was quite a bit greasier as well. The food was cold when it arrived (again).  Very disappointing - I will be looking elsewhere for our Indian orders from now on. It's too expensive to get burned by Banjara a third time."}
{"text":"When it comes to Indian food, one would figure that I know my stuff.  Well, I got a bit of a shocker today - I went to Banjara for dinner tonight and I thought that it was going to be bad - as I had bad experiences at its previous incarnations as Mr. Maharaja (on Balmuto) and Banjara when it was at Yonge and Charles - but, I was proven incorrect!  The food was quite tasty!  I was with five others and we had a good array of dishes. I tried the Panner Tikka (a little crispy, tangy and done just right!), Aloo Ghobi (which had some curry leaves in it - so be careful), Chana Masala (not bad) Baingan Bharta (a great Panjabi dish) and Palak Paneer (not the best I had, but very good).  I would have to say that the Eggplant and the Paneer Tikka were my faves!   The naan was decent, and the rice was cooked to perfection!  I will return!"}
{"text":"My go to for indian food. Visit often. Their shrimp biryani is a must have.  Service can be a hit or miss. Not a fan of the ambience. Good food overall."}
{"text":"I can't even!!! We loved this place for buffet lunch. 12$ each and the food is amazing.  We had four plates each (I'm talking about my kids and I). Tikki chicken is insane. Love love love, service and food is sooo good."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this place last week when I was stressed and feeling pretty stationary. I'd like to mention a caveat that I am rating this 5 star not because it's the best Indian restaurant I have tried, but because this is as good as it gets when it comes to Indian food in Toronto. I have been on the hunt for legitimate south indian food since I have moved here and this is the first time I've tasted anything close to it. I am so excited even writing about it and thinking of the smell of all of those spices. I ordered the Madras Goat and it was delicious. I'm so happy with this place I will definitely come back for more.  Also, their delivery system is so convenient. You can order online and set the time when you want them to show up (they even have lunch delivery, which is pretty freaking awesome)."}
{"text":"Hello:  2.5 stars.  Sunday afternoon meal.  Seated in the outer court.  Two people serving.  Significant wait for server.  1 piece of papadum.  No sauce brought.  Had to ask another server much later.  Ordered:  Lamb vindaloo, spicy, aloo korma, saffron rice and garlic naan.  Mango lassi to drink.  Indian food, for me, is full of colours, flavours and different spices.  It is one of the cuisines that allows for great variation for the palate within the same sitting.  The lamb was anemic and oily.  The vegetables were salty, and the flavours were very similar to the lamb.    As usual:  One piece of naan.  Mango lassi was best thing: smooth, cool, although a little on the rich side.  $40.00.   All in all, not worth it.  As a side note, I do miss the days when an Indian restaurant would serve a \"healthy\" portion of naan.  I really do.  Thank you."}
{"text":"The bloom is off the roti, or put another way this place has gotten a little big for its bhindi. Being always busy means being always harried and getting a table here is neither a reliable or enjoyable prospect. They don't take reservations and this could mean a serious wait. Our group of six stood around the restaurant for 45 minutes (and I was there 15 minutes before that) as they accomodated two-tops and four-tops ahead of us.   All that said, I think their menu features some of the best Indian in the city and it's always at the top of my recommendations. But standing around hungry in a crowded restaurant is *not* the best."}
{"text":"Banjara is back!!!!! I rode my bike by the other day and noticed the open sign lit up and nearly squealed with joy and less than 48 hours later I was sitting among a crowd of other eager eaters at this park-adjacent temple of taste.   I know this all sounds dramatic and superfluous but I was legit very upset at the news in March that they had had a kitchen fire and had to shut down, re-opening TBD. And I know I was not the only one - the barrage of \"noooooo\" 's I got from all over my various social media feeds is evidence of this.   Anyway, suffice it to say, I was very happy to sit down, order a heaping plate of veggie thali (which for the uninitiated is sort of like if Indian curry and a party platter had a baby), and promptly eat the whole thing. I normally am unable to finish the dish in a single sitting (a steal at $13+tax) but call me crazy because this time I did the whole damn thing."}
{"text":"I went to Banjara Indian restaurant in downtown Toronto for the first time with 2 of my close friends on a Saturday evening.  The parking situation is terrible around that area and restaurant does not have its own parking lot. Since it was Saturday evening, the restaurant was very busy yet we were able to find a table within 15 minutes of waiting which was awesome! I tried Tandoori house mixed grill, recommended by one of my friends, which comes with tandoori chicken, Seekh kebab, chicken tikka, tandoori prawn, grilled fish served with Naan bread. The food was good but service was not so great. We got our table outside in the patio where there was no additional light; I thought it would be good to have some lights there so that I could see what I was eating in semi-darkness! or, if there was any bug in my food. Also, the washroom was pretty dirty, yuk!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food! We went with several of my family that were visiting from india and they loved it! Great service and good for groups as well! Try the butter chicken with garlic naan. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my group and we loved our experience compared to the other Banjara location. This location  does not have a crowd . We ordered some dishes as well as the Thali meal which is a good deal for the price.  If you have to pick between the two Banjara locatins, head to this location !!!"}
{"text":"I have come here twice and Food is good . You will be good to go with  the mixed grill, a non vegetarian entree and garlic  naan. .  My only issue is  that they do not take reservations which means long wait times . The lighting is also dim which is not fun for us foodies who like to take pictures of our food. We are forced to use flash which will be annoying  to other patrons. Please increasing the brightness of the lighting. Once these improvements are made i would definitely have this as a four or five star in my next review"}
{"text":"Best everrrrrrrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmm again mmmmmm I like the bowls they serve in. Everything is amazingly delicious just incredible"}
{"text":"Muy buen restaurante con un servicio excelente, la comida estaba muy aceptable seg√∫n los precios, el ambiente del restaurante es muy b√°sico pero no es inc√≥modo para la estad√≠a, el men√∫ est√° un poco extenso."}
{"text":"As I even begin to think of Banjara, my mouth is watering & I'm craving their Naan.  The portions are large (hi leftovers!), the spices are legit, & their service is friendly.    Don't let my short review fool you.  You shouldn't be reading Yelp.  You should be eating the veggie pakoras at Banjara already..."}
{"text":"If you like bland and boring food, go here! I know normally Indian food isn't known as bland or boring, but I've been shown that it's possible. This is by far the worst Indian food I've ever had."}
{"text":"What an ordeal to try and get delivery.  Sure, it was the 26th of Dec so I am sure the kitchen was slammed, but then frankly stop taking orders.  We were told it was going to be 60-90mins when we ordered at 5:37.  2 hours later when we called, we were told the driver had just left.  Another 30mins went by and we called again.  This time we were told the driver hadn't actually left (this was after being on hold for 10mins... 10% of the original estimated delivery time!)... when we questioned what they lied to us, there was obviously no explanation.  When questioned as to a discount for the wait, the person on the phone told us we'd get 15% back in cash from the driver.  So over 3 hours later our food arrived, cold, and of course there was no refund.  I understand that things happen, but own it and use it as a customer service opportunity.   No need for 2 lies AND cold food."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Their chicken dishes, their vegetarian dishes, their seafood dishes, seriously..you should try everything here if you like Indian food.   Always busy here but the service is pretty quick. There's also a button on the side if you want to catch a server's attention too.   I ordered a vegetarian and chicken dish, but because the dishes were so good I got another chicken dish!! Chicken korma, aloo baingan and butter chicken. All were very flavourful and tasty. Thick sauces and just enough spicy level. You can choose between mild medium spicy or very spicy. Medium is good for some kick and still be able to enjoy your meal comfortably if you don't usually eat spicy food. Very spicy is for those who can handle the spice because when I ordered the butter chicken, I asked for very spicy and it was indeed very spicy.   LAST TIP?  You can certainly take advantage of the combo lunch or dinners at the end of the menu. I think it's a pretty good deal! For $10-15, you get a meat dish and all platters served with rice, naan, Daal Curry, Aloo Gobi, Veggie Pakora, and Rice Pudding! You get so much for the price of just the meat/seafood dish which is ordered separately. Pretty good deal if you want to sample everything."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is still a fantastic deal ($11 on weekdays, $12 on weekends).  The hot dishes include butter chicken, tandoori chicken, 1 beef curry, 1 lamb or goat curry, deep-fried wings, chili fish, a few veg curries, 1 paneer curry, 1 legume curry (dal or chana), plain and fried rice, naan, pappadum, and samosas or pakoras.  The cold dishes are some raw salad veg (tomato, cucumber, carrot), mango salad.  Desserts include gulab (served hot on the weekends, cold on the weekdays), various exotic flavours of ice cream, a semolina or tapioca pudding, and simple slices of melon.  Best dishes are the butter chicken, chili fish, and beef curry. The mango salad is pretty good, too. The veg curries tend to turn to mush after a while.   The main problem here is replenishing. Once a dish runs out, it takes them forever to refill. On my last visit, it took 45 minutes to get any of those best dishes I listed above. That is unacceptable.  Many tables just gave up and left in frustration.  And I don't think the gulab ever gets refilled; I typically get these first and leave them on my table while I eat the main dishes.  So get here 15 minutes after it opens, and you're fine.  Don't even bother if it's after 1:30pm.  Service is unobtrusive, sometimes non-existent.  I like that they don't pressure you into buying drinks.  Usually they are good with filling your water glass and clearing dishes, but not always.  This is not a place to take a date; this is where you take your spouse and kids, or go with friends on a budget. It's not high-end, but it is tasty, substantial, and great value."}
{"text":"I can't rate this place on all their food, but I had the Lamb Vindaloo and it tasted great. It does not taste and look the way I am used to it (theirs was a brown colour, instead of dark read), but it did taste ok. The Naan bread with butter was awesome and the service by the ladies was also very good and friendly."}
{"text":"We decided to try a local Indian place we had always wanted to try called Banjara. The place is on the southwest corner of Christie Pits as part of a tiny plaza. The place a former convienence store is glassed on two sides with a few tables, half with banquette seating and the rest with chairs. There is a long bar that runs along the wall opposite to the windows and behind that a glassed off kitchen featuring lots of exciting flames as the food was being cooked. The menu had an impressive list of vegetarian options at decent prices and we were both excited to see how the food measured up. We ordered some fish pakoras, some onion bhajis, the allo bartha, a mushroom curry and an onion kulcha. The service was quick and attentive and the food arrived warm and appetizing looking with the mains served in hammered copper bowls. Everything was delicious, hearty and spiced perfectly. It was a pleasure to discover a new Indian treasure, on the edge of our neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I could eat untold amounts of Paneer Makhani. Like, we're talking ruinous quantities.   Luckily, said Paneer Makhani can be yours in as little as 20 minutes. Yep, that's how long it took from the minute I called Banjara for delivery to the moment my doorbell rang and the bag o' delights was handed over to me. 20 minutes!? Logic defying."}
{"text":"Food was ok, I ordered Palak paneer with tandoori chicken. The cheese was over-cooked. The rasmalai dessert was ok, although it was almost crumbly. The milk was yellow which kind of made me worry but it tasted well and no problems afterwards ;)"}
{"text":"Banjara's a nice name.  Starts with the letter B, coincidentally as does the word... Boombastic. ~~~  I liked the Yelp reviews that I read, before going.  I truly did not like the aftermath of ordering their veggie combo. Was it the lentil curry?  Or the eggplant dish, or the cauliflower?  Or the pakoras??  It's a whodunit.  One of the above, or more than just one, are responsible for the tootiness for the following two days that ensued.  check.  I was full after eating the, check, tasty food.  I was pleased with the assortment of foods in the combo tray.  check.  but *sigh*  both myself and even my female friend reported unusually offensive tooting, that soon enough became a part of our lives.  Which, I can promise you, was upsetting not only to those within our immediate circumference, but also to our own selves.  To fart is one thing, but to fart after having their combo... is something I want to avoid...  at least for the next little while.  Would I eat there again?  I guess.  I'm honestly  a sucker for Indian food.  But I just don't know what to blame, or avoid.  What would have signalled my body to be so, literally, awfully gassy?"}
{"text":"Our go to take away place for mid week spicy food cravings. Although the restaurant is clean and spacious, there's not a lot of people dining in. Not sure why, could be because of the location? I don't mind this anyway as we usually just go to pick up. Favorites are: butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, matar paneer, naans. I've also tried daal, navratan curry, karahi beef - good stuff!"}
{"text":"We were seated right away in the screened in back area, where you can push a button to get waiter service. They have a huge menu. We started with the mango lasse, meat samosa, butter chicken, chicken karahi, goat vindaloo, aloo gobi, baingan bharta, naan, and basmati rice. It was all very flavorful and delicious. I also ended my meal with kheer. It was my birthday lunch and so I indulged. Despite, us having the push button ringer, service was still slow. We didn't get more water until we were finished with our meal."}
{"text":"Had a dinner with my friend in this restaurant tonigth. Food was amazing. I had butter chicken and my friend had chicken Masala. Garlic Naan was really good and tasted fresh. At the end we had a special tea which was good as well. I didn't give a 5 starts because staff was ok but not excellent."}
{"text":"This place is OK depending on what you're looking for.  I've been eating \"Indian food\" for a long time since I was a child so I'm a little bit critical when it comes to flavour.  Overall the service was very good... they have a doorbell system in place at your table where you ring the bell for your server similar to what I've seen at Korean restaurants.  Once we were seated we were greeted with Papadum's (often referred to as cracker things) and two sauces, one which was a chutney which was good and the other yogurt based sauce with mint, cilantro, etc. which was also good.  We started off by ordering the veggie pakora.  It came out quickly and paired OK with the chutney but was a bit stodgy and was not piping hot as if it just came out of the deep fryer as we were hoping it would have been.  For the main course we ordered the chicken biryani, garlic naan, butter chicken and palak paneer.  Of all of the four the palak paneer was definitely the best.  It had decent flavour and was good compared to some other Indian restaurants I have been to in Toronto.  The garlic naan was very good... along with the palak paneer they were definitely the highlights of the meal.  We were impressed by the fact that the butter chicken came packed with chicken for the price we paid but tasted extremely, extremely bland and had little to no flavour, at all... it seemed like the chicken was literally breast meat cubed up and thrown into the sauce.  Very disappointed in this dish.  It tasted like store shelf butter chicken sauce (maybe even worse).  The chicken biryani was just OK.  Same cubed up breast meat we had in the butter chicken but the flavour was just lacking and needed the cilantro/mint sauce added to it to make it desirable to eat.  It had whole seeds in it which I assumed would have made the flavour more intense but it just didn't for some reason.  Overall Banjara is probably a good place to go if you're new to Indian food and do not like spices and complex flavours but favour quantity over quality.  Personally I would not go back again with so many other better choices around the GTA.  Not sure how this place got 4 out of 5 stars... seriously."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. I felt like I was in India. Decor was different from what's typical in Toronto. We got the vegetarian platters and that was a great way to try a variety of food. Also the vegetarian samosas were made fresh! Service was a tad slow."}
{"text":"Banjara, the perfume of Christie Pits.   The thing about Indian food for me, is that I crave it, and when I'm eating it the aromas are beautiful... but the smell of other peoples' vindaloos, curries and paneers often turn me off. So when I lived near Banjara and got a whiff when the wind changed, I wasn't into it... but now that it's not part of my day to day life, man do I want it. I want it all of the time.   Their dine in experience, is a red velvet treat, but I usually go for delivery. Delicious, delicious tandoor straight to my door."}
{"text":"if you're planning a nice evening Indian meal I'd suggest you go to their other location on Bloor near Christie but if you're looking for the best Indian buffet around I'd come to this location during their lunch hours. First off you really can't go wrong for $9.99 and it really is the best indian buffet in the city, always fresh and a great selection of both meat and vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"I LOVE Indian food, and when I say that this place is as good as it gets I really mean it. I have been to India and this place brings back those flavor memories every time I taste any of their food. I have not found a single item on this menu that I was not impressed with and I get the feeling I'm not alone. Banjara is always very busy and they have a huge kitchen staff on duty at all times which probably indicates that they also do a lot of take out and delivery but it also means that everything is fresh fast and delicious.  I could eat here once a week, and some weeks I do."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in forever. But the last time I was here, it was awesome. My friend and I sat on the patio and enjoyed some amazing butter chicken. We both had ordered the butter chicken platter for each of ourselves. We both had leftovers and left satisfied. When I'm craving some butter chicken, I'll have to remember to come here.   From what I recall, the service was mediocre but they were also really busy. I figure this place might be better for takeout.  Solid quality, good portions and fair prices!"}
{"text":"Terrific Indian restaurant, one of my favourites in Toronto, but temporarily the Christie Pits site is closed due to a fire. Pity!"}
{"text":"Okay guys. Take it from an East Indian woman. This is the best Indian food in the city. My in laws who live in Brampton (also known for the very high Indian population) come all the way from there to have Indian food in downtown Toronto at Banjara. I didn't even know this gem of a place existed until I met my husband 5 years ago.   This is not a classy, pretty, well decorated restaurant like Dhaba or Aroma on King St. W. It's a fast moving, crowded, in and out restaurant. What it lacks in ambiance, elegance and style, it makes up ten fold in quality of food. It is no surprise why this place is always always full. And it's not only filled with Indian patrons, but non Indian folk as well. It doesn't matter if you've grown up eating Indian food or eat it once in a while or are just getting accustomed to the cuisine, this is a restaurant that makes everyone want to come back for more.  There are buttons at every table that you press when you are ready to order your food and magically a waitress or waiter will appear. It is that hectic and that busy that they need buttons!   My favourite dishes here are the Butter Chicken, Baigan Bharta, Matar Paneer and Any of the Biryanis. Even though these are my go to dishes, I am sure that most dishes here are just mouth watering delicious. I was skeptical when my husband had told me about this place and it being the best in the city, priding myself on being quite the Indian food connoisseur but when I saw that Banjara was the number 1 restaurant on many sites I knew I had to give it a chance. Well once I did, I've been here many times knowing I will never leave disappointed.  One tip, if you live in their delivery zone, I find that if you get take out, because their containers are larger than the bowls they use at the restaurant, you actually get more food for the same price when you get it delivered or pickup to go. And unlike other cuisines like sushi or pizza, eating Indian food (especially Indian food from Banjara) served at the table fresh, or half and hour later in a container, it will be just as good!"}
{"text":"Banjara is a solid 3.5 for me. The service was friendly, the atmosphere was lively, and the price was great, but the food was hit or miss. My friend and I went for dinner and ordered the chicken platters, which are 14.99 for an entree of your choice along with several sides: aloo gobi, daal, rice, naan, pakora and rice pudding.   For the amount of food it was a great deal. I chose the chicken tikka masala and my friend chose the butter chicken and both were delicious. I also loved the rice pudding and naan. I found the rest of the sides underwhelming and not as flavourful. I would recommend it for the value, but it's not the best Indian food I've had (granted, I've tried a lot)."}
