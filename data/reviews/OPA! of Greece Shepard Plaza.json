{"text":"This is the second Opa Souvlaki I've visited in the last month and I was pretty happy with my dinner. I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki with Greek Salad to go. It comes with a roasted potato, rice pilaf, pita bread and tzatziki. This place wasn't too busy. In fact, it was empty before I arrived. It's sad, really, because the food is good and the decor was warm and inviting. But when you offer a decent take-out meal, who wants to stick around?"}
{"text":"Couldn't decide what to make for dinner and then remembered that this place existed. While the location is great the parking lot is very small which they share with another couple other chain restauratrants and a bank. So you might have to park a little ways away but it will be worht it.

As we entered I noticed that it was very clean and welcoming. Only one other customer was in there. We were greeted by a friendly lady working the cash who was patient with us as we tried to decide what we wanted. Once we ordered the cook was fast and efficient getting our food to us. Other staff members were cleaning the table and chairs keeping the place looking good. 

Our meals were excellent and as a bonus I notice that this location wasn't super cheap on the tzatziki! I'm one happy customer! I will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Opa! Greek Shepard Plaza is a small fast food restaurant in Canada. It opened 20 years ago and there are so many locations in Canada right now. OPA has combined fresh Mediterranean cuisine with its friendly customer services.

Last weekend, my boyfriend and I had a lunch at OPA! Greek in McKenzie Town. The OPA! is located at 130 Ave SE, Calgary. This location is very small and hard to find. It has parking spaces, but they are not very easy for parking. We arrived the restaurant when it just opened. So, it was not busy. I ordered LAMB OPA PLATTER and my boyfriend had LAMB PITA WRAP. Since OPA is the quick service restaurant,  after the server took the orders, the cook made both dishes in front of us.  Then, we brought our food to the table. Our food was in the large portions, fresh and well cooked. The taste of the food was very delicious and tasty. I love my meal. The prices of the two dish were around $25 include the tax,  which was not bad."}
