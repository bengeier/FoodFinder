{"text":"Total Rip Off. Ordered Cheese Tortellini and Mac and Cheese. Not sure how someone can get that wrong.

Absolute waste of 25 bucks. the cheese sauce in the mac and cheese had coagulated to almost dry. The tortellini had not cooked through and was almost raw with zero salt. The manager said they expected us to salt it ourselves. Wow. Then he hung up. 

It wasn't a sorry it was not to your expectation. He never asked what he could do to make it right. It was a non apology .. I am sorry you feel that way. I didn't need him apologizing for how I feel. He then hung up on me. What a jerk!"}
{"text":"After seeing they won the pizza wars, I had to try this place. I'm from Long Island as well as having spent many summers in Buffalo so I know what I'm looking for in a pizza. I ordered a large half plain half pepperoni pizza and 6 hot wings. I enjoyed the overall experience very much. The sauce, cheese, and pepperoni were all very good. The one downfall of the pizza was I didn't seem to find anything special about the dough which is what prevents me from giving it 5 stars. However, I did order the Buffalo style crust which is a tad thicker and I prefer the thinner NY style. Since I was in a Buffalo restaurant I wanted to try the Buffalo style first to see what I thought. Next time I will have to try the NY and update my review to see if I find that any better. The wings were excellent and reminded me of buffalo. I actually live 20 min away from this place and ordered my food to go (I do have a hot bag in trunk) so I'm positive that if I were dining in the wings would be even better considering how good they traveled. Easily top 5 place in Charlotte for wings. I'm usually a ranch guy but any real wing eater knows you eat good wings with blue cheese so thats what I ordered and I really think it might of been the best blue cheese I ever had. Other cons that kept me from rating this 5 was the wing prices a single order of 6 is $6 thats a little steep unless you are getting big jumbo wings and while certainly not small they weren't anything special. I would definately go to this place again especially to try the NY style dough but, I still dont think I've found a place I necessarily have to go out of my way for. The search continues for the best pizza in charlotte."}
{"text":"Love this \"buffalo\" pizza. The crust is awesome. Just right between thin & thick crust. Not sure where they get their pepperoni from but hope they never change it. Love the pepperoni. The pizza is even better when you dine in and it comes straight from the oven to your table. The cheese is real good and it's not greasy. Wings are also real good. This is my new \"go-to\" pizza place."}
{"text":"they said they were awarded best Pizza in Charlotte, so had to try. I thought it tasted like something you get at the roller rink or movie theatre. I just didn't get the hype."}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday right at noon. There was one other family inside. We are a family of five. We ordered a 6\" cheeseburger sub, cheese ravioli, a small NY Pie, and a calzone. We waited FORTY-FIVE MINUTES for the order before I got up to check on it. The sub and ravioli was on a shelf and was handed to me basically cold. The pasta didn't even need to be blown on before I fed it to my 10 month old. Another ten minutes went by before my daughter's pizza and husband's calzone came out. The pizza was good, but the calzone was doughy and not thoroughly cooked -- amazing for an order that he waited almost an hour for!! My son enjoyed his cheeseburger sub. I went up to pay as we were leaving (the credit card machine was down when we ordered) and the manager did comp the calzone. It was $38 and not worth a quarter of that. Bummer of a visit and no extension by the management to apologize, explain, or invite us back."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Charlotte. Nothing I've had around the area even compares.  Crust is light and fluffy and the pepperoni is great. Definitely the go to place for pizza."}
{"text":"Sad that the quality here is dropped so much since they opened a few months back.  The pizza used to be very good.  Now it tastes like under cooked frozen pizza.  It seems that they are using cheaper ingredients and it is impacting the quality."}
{"text":"This is a very sub par slice of pizza. The dough is soft and soggy, not helped by the amount of grease   The sauce is bland with way too much pepper trying to cover that up. This is very similar to little caesars but for about three times the price. There are much better options for pizza in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Nothing warrants a one-star from me more than feeling like I was ripped off. My first time ordering here; I ordered a calzone to go. Paid the extra $2.00 for two toppings for a total of a $13.00 calzone. I cut the calzone in half and could see the black olives I ordered scantily, very scantily throughout the calzone The sausage I tasted perhaps three times while eating it. Way too much ricotta as well. Well, perhaps it seemed like too much because there were no other ingredients in there worth noting! The actual size of the calzone was small as the tiny amount of ingredients were all in the center with nothing but 2 inches of dough all around the outside. If I want to eat $13.00 worth of dough I'll buy a 3-4 loaves of the most expensive bread out there! I won't be back."}
{"text":"We have visited Bisonte's several  times as they have the best pizza logs and wings around.  I'm giving this review a 2 because of our most recent visit and the one before.  We asked for mild chicken wings which were delivered with hot sauce and we couldn't eat them.  We told the server who took them away and then immediately brought them back.  I asked what they did to make them mild - they put mild sauce on them.  The wings were still hot and we couldn't eat.  In the past the mild have come out dry and this is how we expected them.  We told them they had been dry on our previous orders (which have been many).  We asked for a slice of pizza, which we reminded the server we had ordered.  They brought out a piece that was cold and we asked them if they would reheat it.  They reheated it and gave us two pieces.  One of the men behind the counter did come by and check on us.  Meanwhile both owners were behind the counter and did not come over to our table.  This is the second time we have had an issue and the owner looks away.  Apparently they enough business that they don't care."}
{"text":"3pm.   ordered large pizza w/ tomato & basil to go.   got there & there was only one other customer @ the register counter.  2 employees & 1 manager (i think, if not the owner) talking to this ONE customer.  so i say \"hi im picking up an order\".   the one employee tells me to hold on & all 3 of them continue talking to this ONE customer.  i'm like, okay.  i didn't realize it takes 3 people to take care of ONE customer!  i go outside for a few minutes to make a call.  come back in & this time noone is there.  along came another employee after a minute & i pay for my large pizza.  i get home & open the pizza box & it looks like they just re-heated a large pie & gave it to me.   so i took a pic.  watya all think??   the tomato & basil & cheese r all over done.  perfect example of a re-heated pie.  $20+ for this pie.   ouch!   big mistake."}
{"text":"Legit Buffalo style pizza. Everything was on point with the pizza. Buffalo style is a slightly thicker dough than any NYC style but not quite like Chicago style. Right at that sweet spot in the middle. Their wings are also excellent and between both of those, I felt like I was eating back in Buffalo. Chicken Finger sub is also very good and another Buffalo tradition you should try."}
{"text":"We visited for the first time this past Friday evening.  We ordered a buffalo style pepperoni pizza, medium wings (homemade blue cheese dressing) chicken parm, and fettuccine.  It was ALL great!  My husband wanted to go back on Sunday, but I wouldn't let him!  An asset to the Indian Trail area, and I don't think it will be too long before you can't get a table!"}
{"text":"Very good local pizza joint. This may be sacrilege, but our family does not like NY style pizza so I can't speak to that. But, Bisonte has a buffalo style pizza with thicker crust and we love it! It's not the best pizza we've ever had but it's consistently good, well priced and convenient. Pepperoni are nice and thick. We get the \"sheet\" pizza and it's enough to feed a small army. They are our go-to for pizza takeout. We've tried the subs, which are also tasty."}
{"text":"Great pizza, nice salads and really good staff.  Love the specialty pizzas - especially the White.  It's not a white like a clan pizza or Alfredo.  It's white with fontinella cheese and that was a treat.  Tomato Basil Roma was amazing.  Better than most margherita pizzas.  Antipasto salad had lots of meats.  Priced right with lots left over to take home ... Bonus!
It's a bit off my travel path, but I promise I'll be back."}
{"text":"Decent pizza and wings.  Ordered a veggie pizza (buffalo style) and hot wings.  The pizza was great but the wings were just okay (we should have tried the specialty ones vs. just hot).  Service was decent which was pleasantly surprising since we went on opening day.  Will be back to try their sandwiches and other wing flavors."}
{"text":"We try to support small businesses and have now been to Bisonte twice. And both times the wings were awesome! We've lived in Charlotte for several years and have searched high and low for great wings.  And I agree with another post - they have nailed it both times.  The staff was friendly too!  We have small children who are often picky about what they'll eat and they gobbled it up!  It's great to have a place not too far from our neighborhood with quality food.  I hope others will support this place - you can't go wrong with the hot and BBQ wings. Yum!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Buffalo chicken is a must have, dip it in wing sauce and its Buffalo wing Pizza! Recommend the Buffalo style crust, not thick, not thin but just right. Local owners - great service. Highly recommend, kid friendly."}
{"text":"Take it from me, it's buffalo authentic! Buffalo style pizza and wings are amazing. Homemade blue cheese and BBQ wings are charbroiled. These guys know pizza!"}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular!  My wife and I both grew up around Buffalo and this place has nailed the food!  Pizza is outstanding, wings and chicken fingers are amazing...subs are to die for!  Jimmy and Steve the owners are there a lot.  Place is always clean, service is excellent and food is remarkable!  Great job guys!  My family and I dine there often!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza and subs. The wings are awesome. Overall good quality but a little expensive."}
{"text":"Love their wings for Sunday football! Watching the game without them isn't the same! Going to order some right now again!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there. Excellent pizza and delicious chicken wings. We got the bacon chicken ranch pizza and the medium buffalo wings. You should really try it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to try this place for the first time tonight. I have to say that the toppings and flavor were fine but the crust was the soggiest dough we have ever had anywhere!  We only live five minutes from here and even tried to re-heat in the oven on a stone but it was still mushy and soggy. Why?  You guys need to work on this as we have driven home with pizzas before and never had this issue. I guess one has to sit down at the restaurant and not take out. Totally disappointing."}
{"text":"I have been here about 15 times already.  I grew up in Buffalo and this is just like home.  I eat here at least once a week and love everything.  The chicken fingers, BBQ on the pit are out of this world.  The pizza is awesome with the great pepperoni.  The pizza needs to be cooked a little more at times so I ask for it crispier.  I love the food so much but my only two complaints are the inconsistency from visit to visit.  When the owners cook, it's always great but sometimes they are gone and results aren't the same.  The prices are a little high for the area but its worth it to me.  The chicken finger sub is to die for as well as the wings.  Give it a try!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I did not realize pepperoni was so small. They were about the size of a dime. The pizza was under cooked and very chewy. I hear the sandwiches are good. Regretfully, two visits with bad experiences both times was all I need. I wish them the best yet a year in business at the Trade Street Location may be a stretch."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and even better customer service. The owners of Bisonte not only cook amazing food, but go the extra mile for the customer to have an enjoyable dining experience. Highly recommend all items on the menu, and add some sesame seeds to your pizza crust!"}
{"text":"I just tried Bisonte for the first time today and the Beef on Weck was delicious. Staff were very friendly. Overall good experience and I will definitely be back!  Thanks."}
{"text":"Nice to see new options in the area. I am a big NY pizza fan, and their thin crust NY style was just ok. It was a bit pricey too. The sauce on it was good, just not enough of it. The pepperoni were miniature, and the kids joked about it.  The crust was decent.We went back and had Italian sub. The bread was good and the meats were good quality. The kids meals were a good size and quality.   My wife got the tortellini Alfredo, again ok.  We might go back, but if I want better NY style fare I will go down the road to Marios."}
{"text":"Got to say this place is the best. I am from Buffalo and eating here makes me feel like home. If you are in the mood for pizza buffalo style this is your place. Chicken wings best in the area better than Anchor Bar. The subs are amazing chicken Philly, steak bomber and cheeseburger sub you cannot go wrong w Costanzo roll wow. In the mood for Italian food try the chicken Parm wow. There isn't 1 bad thing on the menu. Everything is made from scratch and fresh. This place is the best hope it grows into more in the Charlotte. Best part beside the food is the staff owners Jimmy and Steve make you feel like you are eating at home. If you like good good trust me eat here."}
{"text":"As a Buffalo expat, Bisonte hits the spot everytime.  The pizza is delicious and the beef on weck sub transports you back home.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is the best...awesome....get the wings extra crispy and its like you are back in buffalo. The deals are great and when its time for the big game sunday, this is the place.  The staff is awesome and nice."}
{"text":"I would have posted a picture, but I ate all of my food.  Ordered the pizza sub to go because I was working, but just the same, it was awesome. Just like being back in WNY.  The place looks great, definitely will fit in uptown. The staff is friendly and Jim is a great guy! Can't wait to bring the family and stop by and watch the Bill's and Sabres games here this season. Definitely will be my new hangout. Just gotta get some more Bills and Sabres stuff up, but that will come in time I am sure!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here last night and it is a pretty good pizza joint! The wait staff was attentive and the pizza was good. There was nothing that really *wowed* me about this place, but I will be back for sure. The environment pretty clean and is also pretty basic."}
{"text":"Ordered cheese pizza last night. Food came in good time and hot. It was awful. Know it's suppose to be like ny pizza. Bring from ny it was Far from that. Sauce and crust not good at all. Three more then half a pie out. Disappointed because we live nearby and it would have been great to have a local place that delivers."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and attentive. The pizza tasted like it was from Buffalo. It is worth the drive. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. First off, charging $20 for a pizza outside of uptown with one topping is robbery. Second, I requested an extra crispy pizza and when I showed up they said they burnt it too much and had to cook another one. The picture attached is what I got. An undercooked mess. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my chicken parm. And spaghetti lunch.  The waiter was a little confused about what came with it (spaghetti and an awesome garlic stick) but no big deal.

I did have to wait longer than others for my meal to arrive.  So it may not be the best place for people with light item time for lunch."}
{"text":"Likely won't go back.  Stand in line order and then pick a table.  Don't order wine it's Sutter Home in the small bottles.  Pizza is okay, light ingredients.  5 toppings,still seemed more like a cheese pizza."}
{"text":"I had the wings and sub. Both were excellent. Try The Stinger!  Wow.   Friendly people and neat little atmosphere."}
{"text":"As a Western NY native and third ward resident, I was very excited to see that a WNY style pizza joint opening just a two block walk from my home. I had actually not realized it had already opened when I was walking to grab some lunch today. 

I walked up to the bar and was greeted immediately by the friendly bartender and the owner was present as well. As I was in a hurry, I just ordered two slices of pepperoni to go. But, while I was waiting, I did take in the Buffalo decor (signed Andre Reed jersey was a great touch) and the fact that a delivery man was hauling in some labatt blue. What a great reminder of home! The slices came out quickly and I assured them that if the slices proved delicious, I would be a regular. 

Once I opened the box, the pizza did not disappoint. Nice fluffy and soft dough, great sauce, no lack of cheese and a nice, crisp crust. I am having several friends down from WNY this summer and I will be taking them all to Bisonte to get their thoughts!

I sincerely look forward to many evenings where I'll be able to eat there and wash it down with a nice cold blue light!"}
{"text":"Once you are able to get through on the phone to order the service and pizza are very good. Usually have pizza in hand within 25-35 minutes. The hot and cold subs are very good as well but I feel are overpriced at $10 for a full size (no side with that)."}
{"text":"Good pizza! My husband and I have been trying to find good \"New York style\" pizza and this place comes pretty close! The flavors are all there and the sauce to cheese to crust ratio is blissful! I love this place and recommend anyone hungry for a slice to check them out!"}
{"text":"Bisonte Pizza company is the best pizza and wings in the Carolinas I visited for the first time on 12/05/15 and it was just like going back home to Buffalo NY I suggest everyone  should give this place a try I promise you will not be disappointed.  And all you Buffalo people this is Lanovas in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Being a semi-regular, tonight's pizza wasn't up to Bisonte's usual high quality! The staff was their ever present friendly selves checking on us a number of times. Tonight's pie was dry, minimally sauced & the sausage was MIA! Crust was uneven, being thick in some spots and thicker in others. The pep was generous. Shared comments with a Team member & was thanked for the feedback. We'll be back expecting the \"Charlotte's Best Pizza\" reputation~ds"}
{"text":"Got there at 8:55 and they let me in and sit and eat.... That along with them wings made my night.... GREAT place"}
{"text":"First time visiting Bisonte and will now come regularly. Had a classic buffalo pepperoni pizza with buffalo wings. Great food and service!"}
{"text":"Got order to go.  Didn't realize til got home and ready to eat how taken I'd been. Sandwich based on horseradish had none. Called and spoke to mgr who said they get complaints about too much horseradish....so he left it off?!!! And the small salad that was $6 had about 3 pieces of lettuce and two chunks of tomato. Again he said they were cutting back on portion size. His response was \"what do you expect me to do?\" REALLY?!! If manager is that horrific with customer service they don't deserve my business or anyone else's for that matter."}
{"text":"I would like to think I've tried a wide variety of pizza places in Charlotte....bisonte pizza is definitely my favorite!! I'm from New Jersey and have lived in upstate New York, so I'm supposed to know what qualifies as \"good\" pizza, right?! 

You have the option of choosing from buffalo or NY style and specialty crusts. The Buffalo is ever so slightly thicker than the NY and my go-to style, as well as the butter or Parmesan crust. I have tried the cheese and pepperoni pizza. I'm not usually a big fan of pepperoni, but these pepperonis are smaller than your typical topping and seem to be baked prior to being added to your pizza. I love the crispy aspect that they add!

My boyfriend tried their boneless wings which came with a side of fries. Maybe that's a Buffalo thing? 

I'm very happy that this place opened uptown and wish them nothing but success! I just realized that you can sign up for email deals. It would be great if they linked up with Yelp for cash back when you dine there. Also, I would suggest that they send out a coupon to residents in the immediate area to increase local 4th ward support."}
{"text":"A guy I work with is a Buffalo native and had already gone a few times since it opened, so three of us decided to check it out for lunch.  I got the 12\" Stinger with Hot and BBQ sauce.  A Buffalo staple, toasted sub with chicken fingers tossed in your choice of sauce, steak, and cheese .  I was going to get the 6\" and fries but changed my mind and just got the 12\" and it was almost to much food by itself.  Overall very pleased with the food.  I thought it was a little pricey but food seemed worth the little extra in price.  I will be coming back to try the Beef on Weck and of course the \"Buffalo\" style Pizza and Wings.  You can't go wrong with the Stinger but you better be hungry and have a place to take a nap in the afternoon."}
{"text":"I will give this another try someday. But, this evening (Saturday May 21,2016) I called for takeout. 

The girl who answered must have said \"wait a sec\" 5 times in the first 30 seconds. 

I wanted to order an Italian. She was not ready and asking me to \"hold on a sec\" over and over.

Don't answer the phone if you are so occupied with something else. Or, ask me to hold till you can give the appropriate attention to a customer.

Then she asked me if I wanted steak on the Italian. Steak on an Italian...?

I said no. Then she asked me what I wanted on it.  I had to go back to the menu on Yelp and word for word tell her what comes on the Italian.  I then said that I wanted it bake as their menu allows for an extra charge.

She was again unsure if they could bake it. She put me on hold. 3 minutes on hold and I was done. I disconnected the call.

Normally, I do not write \"bad\" reviews. But, this experience was frustrating and comical.

I'd like to try the food one day. Maybe, I'll just eat in the shop."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the charlotte area! Best wings game n the charlotte area! Beef on weck and other great buffalo items are all here! Owners and staff are very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! True buffalo wings and pizza. New location is awesome. Food is great across the board. Owners and staff are super friendly. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza place!  We came here after seeing the reviews and were not disappointed. Staff was knowledgeable and friendly.  Would recommend!  Will come back"}
{"text":"Between the bland, dry fries, the overly soggy pizza, and requests for clean plates, today's stop was a bit of a bust. Hopeful things pick up."}
{"text":"Second review.  Not so good this time.  Took about 30 minutes to get our food and there were only 4 other tables in the restaurant at the time.  Two girls at the counter on their phone.  Got charged .94 cents extra for some ranch for my kid to dunk his two chicken strips in...really?  Beef on weck $10.49 for a 12-inch and that does not include any side item.  Wings at more than $1.00 each...............I'm not so sure we will go back again."}
{"text":"We have eaten here on a couple of occasions since they opened. The pizza is ok, nothing great. I  have to say that we placed and order this evening, we were told it would be 15-20 minutes. I walked in 25 minutes later and had to wait for the pizza. There were only 2 tables and they were eating when I arrived, so it really did not make sense. In 5 minutes or so, my order was ready. We ordered one small cheese pizza, and a white pizza, which they classify as a specialty pizza which is news to us. My wife ordered a salad too. When we called it in they said it would be $32. We really thought either we misunderstood, or it was a mistake on their part, Well it was correct, $32 for a small cheese pizza ($10) which had a burnt bottom crust, small white pizza (14.99) and a small Caesar salad (5.49) with Ken's packaged Caesar dressing.  As I said, the food is ok, the price is outrageous, and it is convenient but with all the pizza places in the Indian Trail I think they need to rethink their pricing, or I am afraid they will not survive. We could of gone to many area restaurants and eaten much better for less money. I do not see us ordering another pizza from this place again,"}
{"text":"I was craving wings and pizza one day and I found them on yelp. I sat at the bar and was waited on by the bartender Lucky. He was super friendly and gave me lots of suggestions. I ordered the famous honey bbq and they were amazinggggg! Perfect amount of crispness. I also ordered a slice of cheese pizza (I'm kinda picky and I only eat cheese), but it was just okay. I would probably only come here for the wings, but I'm sure the other pizzas are good just looking form the pictures."}
{"text":"This place does a fabulous job of catering. We have used them three times and each time our guests rave about this pizza! Their wings are crispy and delicious. There pizza is incredible and their salad was wonderful. Anytime we do a meeting in Charlotte we will Bisonte Pizza Co cater it. They are always spot on!!"}
{"text":"I've been back a few times and Bisonte is on point.  The homemade meatball sub was amazing but I think it should at least come with a bag of chips.  The people working are always very nice.  This is by far the most authentic Buffalo food in the area, even if they are missing the beef on weck and haddock fish fry."}
{"text":"We've always been pleased with our orders here!! The Buffalo style pizza is awesome, as are their wings. We will continue to come here and maybe even order something else!! It's just hard to order something different when what we get is so good :)"}
{"text":"Okay so I lived in Buffalo for 10 years so I know something about the food. I have also visited Bisonte's original Matthew location several times and have stated that it's the only Buffalo food joint in the area that gets everything right. The same can be said for the uptown location except that the setup is much different and the menu is slightly smaller.

First, for dine-in, this location is waiter/waitress service unlike the counter service in Matthews. The uptown location used to be a different place (and probably more than one) and sits in the shadows of Johnson and Wales University. Uptown has a nicely decorated small bar and some local beers on tap and in bottles and cans. Don't worry Buffalo people, they have Labattt Blue too. 

As I mentioned the menu is smaller; a couple of the subs and the eggplant Parmesan pasta are missing from uptown. Still, the food was good and tasted just like food at the the original one. The char-b-q wings from the pit were amazing. You probably figured it out from the other reviews that Buffalo style pizza is thicker and that is good too. They also have the thinner NY style if you prefer that.

I should also mention that our service was excellent and our orders were perfect. I would have liked to have had a few carrots and celery with the wings but that is not a huge deal."}
{"text":"This place has the worse customer service I ever experienced. I wasn't greeted when I came in, they took almost 20 minutes for a cold sub. And I was the only person in there. The manager and the other employees were just doing their own thing...like I wasn't even there. The guy finally gave me my sub and just looked at me. Not \"have a good day, sorry about the wait\". Nothing at all! I drove 30 mins for nothing. For them to take so long, you would think my sub would of been spectacular. It wasn't, at all! I'm from Buffalo, and this place is making my city look bad. I like to try new spots, but it didn't go so well this time. I'm just going to stick to what I know and that is \"The Taste of Buffalo\". The staff is great and the food. They make you feel right at home. They represent Buffalo well!!!! You want good food and customer service..go to The Taste of Buffalo!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit. I don't particularly like the order at the counter theme when I'm dining in.  I wanted to try hot wings and then pizza. Ordering at the counter makes it hard to pace the meal.  The food seemed to take a long time to come out, consistent with other reviews I've read. The wings were good, nice traditional buffalo flavor but I wouldn't say they are a must have. If I got them again I'd probably ask for them to be extra crispy because although it says crispy on the menu they were anything but. 
    I went back to the counter to order a pizza. In hindsight if I had known how long it was going to take I would have ordered all at once. We got the NY style with garlic crust. The pizza had good flavor but the crust was a far cry from a NY style crust. It was just way too soft almost \"Mushy.\" As a former New Yorker I have about 32 years of NY Pizza experience to base my opinion.  Maybe the Buffalo style pizza is their specialty?  If I were to get it again, I would have to ask for the crust to be crispy, same issue with the wings. 
    Couple other notes. It's a Pepsi establishment which is often the case in pizza joints. As a Coke fan, it's disappointing.  I opted for unsweet tea which wasn't very good and they don't have the pink  sweetener, just the blue. 
   The tab adds up real quick here. I don't mind spending the money but for what his meal cost I'd rather have it brought to me."}
{"text":"This has been the worst experience ever! First the driver tried to solicit a tip after he delivered the pizza. My husband still tipped him $5 on a 29.00 tab! Then when I finally eat a slice, there is a brown hair in my pizza!!!  You will see that the hair is baked in the cheese! I will NEVER order from this place again. It's over priced and not worth it!"}
{"text":"The food here is great but the service is horrible. My husband and I called to place a order for pick up and were put on hold for 10 minutes. When we asked to speak to the manager my husband was talking to the manager who was rude and the manager ended up hanging the phone up on my husband. I have had terrible service from them before but loved the food so I always let it slide until this time. The manager and staff were very rude. Pizza and everything else is great but don't go in thinking you will get good service. Will never order from them again."}
{"text":"We love Bisonte (Italian for Buffalo) pizza!  Great , great Buffalo style pizza! Thick crust, but not too thick) crust. He brings ingredients from Buffalo!
Give it a try."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and the service is excellent! Love it!! The Wings!!! Double fried and dipped!"}
{"text":"Being a Native Buffalonian, this place is the real deal. The curl up pepperoni and sauce make the Buffalo style pizza. The subs are great as well; not to mention the Wings. Never had anything I didn't love and great service to boot!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally great restaurant. The openers go out of their way to make sure you feel welcomed and have an overall great experience. Have not been disappointed in good or service. The pizza logs are a must try if you are there and need to look into their stinger sub as well as any of their pizzas!"}
{"text":"We started with the pizza rolls, now I am craving them! Came with a delicious homemade marinara with a touch of sweet.Had a Greek Salad and the dressing was homemade for sure, super yum! Probably one of the best salads I have had in a while. My boyfriend loved his pizza! They carry Pepsi products which is meh! The staff was friendly and upbeat! They did a great job designing the place, but our table was wobbly. Super annoying when you try to enjoy your company and food! We will definitely be back to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"Well my expectations were very lofty as my friend I visited with referred to this place as having the \"best pizza ever.\" I was very eager yet simultaneously skeptical.

My initial impression was not the best given it was twenty five dollars for a thirteen inch meat lovers and two fountain drink cups. Subsequently, it took almost thirty minutes for the pizza to come out at a very non busy time. But luckily my friend urged me to be patient and it was certainly worth it.

While waiting and chatting we observed the photos on the wall wondering the city. It ended up being Buffalo, something I was finally able to guess due to the presence of American and Canadian flags in the few blocks of the city the photo showed clearly.  Still, I was surprised when the employee I asked confirmed this as Buffalo isn't what I thought of as a great pizza town.

The pizza was fresh out with all the meats: pepperoni, sausage, ham, ground beef, and bacon evenly and deliciously distributed throughout the pizza. The three cheeses were layered I believed I counted almost four with my tastebuds. Yum! Yum! Yum! 

The only thing keeping Bisonte from a five is it is only the second best pizza I've ever had and also I'm impatient so thirty minutes is quite a while to wait."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but was slow getting to the table. That might be because of it only being open a few days. The place is super loud and makes it hard to have a conversation without screaming. Also a few hiccups on table condiment and missing marinara with my friends cheese sticks..   Prices are from reasonable to ouch!!! Depending on what you are getting."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start by sharing that I have high expectations for pizza and Bisonte Pizza did a great job! 

We came in as a group of seven and enjoyed a large pepperoni pizza, two orders of fresh cute fries and a \"triple\" order of wings with honey mustard and bourbon BBQ. 

The wings stood out to me. They were cooked perfectly with a bit of a sear on them and the sauce was evenly coated. The blue cheese is made in-house and is quite tasty (I normally don't touch blue cheese but always agree to try if it is homemade!). The ranch was also a nice accompaniment to the wings and I definitely preferred the BBQ style. 

The cheese on the pizza was ooey-gooey melted perfection, I just wish it came out well-done as ordered. The pepperoni could've been more abundant as well. The crust however was chewy and delicious but not too thick. I'd definitely order again!

The fries were fresh cut and steaming hot. A little too greasy for my preference and could've been seasoned more.  

I'm removing a star for the flaws in execution mentioned above. It's nice to have some decent pizza outside of the NY/NJ area!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night to the Charlotte location.  I've been looking forward to it opening for a while and was not disappointed.  We got pizza and wings and good service as well.  So happy to finally have good Buffalo pizza nearby."}
{"text":"My neighborhood spot. Great service, bartenders are knowledgeable and location is casual and chill. 
Wings were great..try out the bourbon wings. Pixxa, I've tried 2 seperate times, it is subpar. Wings, beer and chill."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but very expensive. It also took quite some time for the pizza to come out.

I enjoyed my visit but may not order a whole pizza again until the price comes down. Note: you can order by the slice, which with a drink would cost a little under $5"}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars if I could. The pizza is great but the service sucks. 

Attempted to order delivery and the girl on the phone took 10 min to take my order because she wouldn't let me talk and then afterward pretended to run my card 3 times and when she said it wouldn't work each time (called the card company, no attempt to even run the card.) Call back to speak to the manager and was told it was a mess up on there end but we couldn't order because they closed in 12 min.

They obviously don't want business and won't ever receive mine. You should take yours elsewhere also!"}
{"text":"The wings are some of the best I have had in Charlotte!
We started with the wings then moved on to the pizza and split an stinger sub. The pizza was amazing you could tell that the ingredients were Freash and they didn't skimp on the quality of products. The steak sub has a special sauce which was amazing I would put it on just about anything."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a pizza place coming to third ward and I have not been disappointed. Since it's opened, I've ordered from there three times already because I can't get enough of the buffalo style pizza! We've also ordered their wings and thought they were great--came out exactly as we wanted them (extra crispy). I've never had any issues with the service and everyone seems super friendly. Love that they stay open a little later on the weekends and would love to see some later nights during the week for that inevitable late night snack craving!"}
{"text":"Updating my review here. The pizza and wings are great but I don't know if I can keep coming back. 

Why no gloves during food prep?  This mohawk guy is picking in his ears AND building my family's Pizza?  Girl at the front is handling money AND cutting fresh celery?  I love this place but I hate to see gross things happening with my food."}
{"text":"I have eaten here quite a few times; never dined in, always had delivery or carry out. The pizza is greasy as hell but delicious none the less. It is my preferred pizza joint even though their pizzas are pricey. For two large pizzas you can expect to spend 40-50 bucks. The salads leave quite a bit to be desired though their ranch and blue cheese are probably two of the best I've ever eaten. French fries are great but soggy when delivered or carried out as they steam in their styrofoam container. 

I quit eating from here about a year or so ago. I felt like I was being \"nickeled and dimed\" every time I ordered. Good food though."}
{"text":"Uncharacteristically for me... not a lot to say. I will keep coming back to review as the pizza is very good and now I am wanting to expand my tastings to a few other areas and see how that goes. 

Couple of concerns but nothing worth sharing right now. If a pattern emerges I will update the post."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings! I'm a Buffalo native and have driven to the Matthews location a few times to get my fix of Buffalo style pizza.  First trip to the Uptown location was not a disappointment.  

Spoke with owner Jimmy N and reminiscing about home was fun, but its the food that will bring me back soon. Great location for the Knights games.  I recommend parking down the street, eating at Bisonte and walking over to the game.  BTW, we've tried that same routine three times with Mellow Mushroom and were late because of slow service every time.  

The Bisonte classic pizza with pepperoni features crispy, thicker slices of pepperoni that are so much better than the typical used everywhere else.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  Great, friendly service and excellent food.  I would recommend a 6\" Steak Bomber and 6 hot wings.  You will enjoy it."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I've ever ate. Me and my husband order weekly! Service is great and they always deliver fast!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Charlotte. The restaurant is large so we never have to wait for a table. Their buffalo chicken pizza is INCREDIBLE. The best thing on the menu by far. I always take my out-of-town guests here and also often order carry-out. Would absolutely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Not being from Buffalo, I didn't know what Buffalo style is, but I love it. More filling than the really thin NY pizza. The flavoring is excellent. Definitely on thr pricey side. I wouldnt order a bunch if pizzas from here for a larger party because of that. But it is our go to place now in the area for good pizza. Have not dined in, only carry out."}
{"text":"Charloteans rejoice, for there is truly a Buffalo pizza joint in town. Close your eyes, take a bite and you are sitting at La Nova's. I just moved back to the area and good friends let me know this gem existed. You can get slices at the counter or order from the full menu. I am so happy this place is in town!!"}
{"text":"Best wings in the QC by far. Also, great true Buffalo food including the Stinger. A must try. Very good service ..the owner is usually there working hard and very nice guy who is originally from Buffalo"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch and sat at the bar. The staff was slow to acknowledge me but like I said, it was late - lunch rush was over and folks were trying to clean up and get ready for dinner.

I ordered the two slice (pepperoni) special and an order of the mild wings... The pizza wasn't what I expected. I was thinking more New York style, thin and on the greasy side. This was a thicker with a bready, chewy crust. The sauce was definitely on the sweet side, tasted more of sugar than tomatoes. The pepperoni flavor was nice but it was these thick, nickel sized slices. Kinda weird.

The wings were nice but too expensive, $7 for six wings? They're f*cking chicken wings people, ridiculous to pay more than a buck per wing. Plus it would be nice if they had some non-Bufalo flavors - garlic,  bbw, etc.

Anyway... Chewy, sweet pizza. Pricey but tasty wings. Lackluster service. Had better and I've had worse but not a place I would go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"AWESUMM!! We kno pizza & wings, we're in town from Buffalo for Bills to paddle the Panthers. We drove 1/2 hr from Charlotte (Elizabeth), & it was worth it! Service and staff were very friendly. If U want cheap tasting Pizza- go elsewhere, they clearly use fresh good quality ingredients- @ reasonable prices. Truly a quality Pizzeria/Rest, & we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but nothing to write home about. My food was cold twice and they definitely tried very hard to fix it but to no avail. The pricing for the area is OUTRAGEOUS. Despite the fact that the owners seem very nice I doubt they will stay in business for long. The food is mediocre and even if it was 100% delicious it is way too expensive."}
{"text":"This is a 30 minute drive from my house it is well worth it. It really is Buffalo the pepperonis are incredible the wings were amazing we will definitely be back to try the chicken finger sub I'm not from Buffalo but I have friends that are and I was sending them photos in their mouths were watering. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great Buffalo style pizza! Exactly what we need here. Ordered the pepperoni pizza and it was just like how I remember in Western NY. Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"The bacon lovers Pizza is the greatest of all-time at Bisonte. One day I fought a homeless man and fire breathing Panda for this pizza and lost. Would get a black eye again. 11/10"}
{"text":"Great staff and service! Fun place with good pizza and yes the homemade blue cheese and ranch dips are out of this world."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bisonte Pizza. Some of the locals in the area really spoke highly of this place. Overall I was pretty pleased with the dining experience. Nothing unbelievably different going on here, but they were pretty solid across the board. 

The inside of the restaurant has a pretty open floor plan with a tv's on the outer walls. You walkup to the counter to order and then the food is brought to you. I heard really good things about the philly steak sub, but I wish I would have gotten all wings, but I was persuaded to get half a sub paired with 6 wings. 

The wings were excellent, especially the carolina-flavored wings. I can see this place being pretty popular on a Saturday night or Sunday afternoon when big games are on. The staff here were very friendly and helpful with menu selection."}
{"text":"UPDATE 3/23:  Received an email from Slice and our order has been refunded.  Thank you. 


Never had the chance to taste their food but will never order from them again. I mistakenly ordered from the SLICE app for pick up...  my fault obviously so once i received the confirmation email and realized they did not deliver to my address i called to have the order canceled.  Apparently it was too late (15-20 min after the order was placed) and they refused to refund anything including a tip that was for delivery.  I acknowledge that I accidentally ordered for pick up but I had no vehicle at the time nor would they remake for later. My husband is a restaurant GM and wasn't impressed with their lack of customer service. We will never recommend this joint...  nor the Slice app!  They got an earful as well since the girl who was supposed to immediately get a cancellation instead took 12 min to tell me they don't deliver to me (already knew at that point!) and never asked to cancel first per my request. 

I prefer restaurants who will work with the customer, not against them.  I'm now out over $50 (including a tip that i will now consider stolen since they did nothing to deserve a tip!!) and my son will be admitted to Levine's tomorrow without his requested Pizza dinner... thanks Bisonte, it's a shame you are out for money and not good reviews. We all know a pizza and 2 subs don't cost you what we paid you!  You could have worked w us a little."}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight I loved the atmosphere it was very posh not your usual pizza spot I ordered 12 wings and got them half medium and half sweet BBQ I liked both flavors they were really good wings I liked the homemade blue cheese i wasn't a fan of the fries however they were a lil bland and soggy our server was very kind tho and attentive they have Pepsi products which I don't like at all however the Pepsi I had wasn't bad"}
{"text":"Ordered several things via DoorDash and was quite disappointed with the food.

First off, the breaded/fried mozzarella was overcooked, overly-salted, bland, and the accompanying tasteless marinara dipping sauce is forgetful.

The very chewy wings, again overly-salted, appeared to be made from starving chickens considering the lack of meat on the bone. Yet, I have to say that the ranch dressing was very good.

Lastly, the salad with chicken was very good but I wish I ordered it with field greens instead of iceberg... The blue cheese was good.

Because the food was delivered I've no opinion on ambiance but their food needs work."}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed with my first experience here. The fiance and I came around 7pm on a weeknight and it wasn't crowded and there was plenty of seating (it's actually a huge space!). We ordered pretty quickly after being seated, but it took at least 30 minutes if not 45 for us to get our food. The wait seemed extraordinarily long considering we had ordered two personal pizzas off the main menu. Everyone around us experienced a similar wait. And no one came by to say, \"sorry for the wait\" or offer an explanation or anything. I wish I could give them the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to being a new place, but they have another thriving location and this location had been open a few weeks already by the time we went.

The pizza was cheesy, but overall so-so. The Buffalo-style crust is a thicker type crust, somewhere between NY and Chicago, so that it can hold the weight of all the toppings and cheese. The slices are still flimsy though and don't have that crunchy crust that I like. There were also very few vegetarian options on the menu. I wound up ordering the Veggie Lovers and subbing spinach fir the black olives (I'm not an olive person). The toppings were fine, but nothing with a ton of flavor or texture. I just felt like there wasn't much to this to help it stand out."}
{"text":"OMG, delicious pizza. Some of the best I've had. However, those pizza logs are not good. Wontons and pizza ingredients are not a good mix. Also, be sure to have plenty of time when you order. Full pizzas are like 25-30 minutes to come out. Also, the charbroiled wings are hands down the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great, great, great pizza!!! Reminded me so much of the food back in Buffalo. Had a pizza and wings and they were both authentic. 

Only flaw was that they were pretty light on the sauce for the pizza. Other than that, everything was great. The bleu cheese was even authentic, think and homemade. 

I really wish there was a Buffalo style pizza place near Myrtle Beach, may have to drive here every couple months for my Buffalo pizza and wing fix."}
{"text":"ok i am from buffalo ny and this place represents everything about buffalo when it comes to the food best pizza and wings in the WORLD"}
{"text":"Great place for pizza and wings. Their bourbon bbq flavor wings are amazing. You can tell they use good quality ingredients. Everything is fresh and homemade. You have to try their fried cheesecake. Customer service is great! Will come back again."}
{"text":"Not to ruin their 4 star rating but it's just ok. Nice to have in the area but the sauce didn't stand out on the pizza, meatball sub nor wings.  

I like wet wings. These are nicely covered but we only got hot. 

I look foreword to trying the Antipasti + grilled wings. 

Dining is an option. You'll be seated. Full bar. 

1 cheese slice $3
12 wings $12.99
1 meatball sub $7.99

They toasted the bun. 
Wings come with the star of the evening: in house homemade Blue cheese and Ranch. You get 2 when you order 12 wings so I was cool. 

$54.99 family deal. It's worth it because of the wings. My family wouldn't be give such, though. 

Oh. They tape the to go boxes  

I have yet to receive anything from the email club. 

Open until midnight. 
Summation: nothing stood out except the dressings. The sauce was bland on the pizza and meatballs. 

$24.88 for the three things ordered above."}
{"text":"Another former WNYer who finds the food here just like home.   From pizza and wings to subs this place is legit.   Great family owned place with service to match."}
{"text":"Yuch.  Ordered veal parm with spaghetti.  Not Real veal.   Terrible Frozen patty.  Manager  agreed.  Did not do anything when i said it was not good.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Fantastic first experience here. Was craving the Stinger and boy were we happily satisfied. I'll probably dream of it often. The pizza was also very good and crispy. Love that! I'm from Buffalo and this made me feel right at home."}
{"text":"Big fan of this Buffalo style Pizza, Wings and Sub joint! They hit the trifecta for me and my friend! We split a dozen wings (try the carolina style sauce), The Stinger (Philly cheese steak with a buffalo flavored chicken tender inside) and a Buffalo style Pepperoni pizza.  

The pizza blew me away the most.  IMO there isn't a lot of great pizza in uptown Charlotte.  This is some of the best i've had in the city.

A lot of space.  Located on S trade near J&W university.  Great beer specials on Thursdays."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I  favorite local pizzeria. the wing are a must have and the sandwiches as well. Don't be scared of the price of the wings they are so worth it. perfect for our date night in the house with a movie."}
{"text":"The absolute best New York pizza. We live in Connecticut and are staying 3 months in Charlotte and this is our favorite Friday night hang out. We love the NY style pepperoni pizza and the Carolina Gold wings are very flavorful. Can't say enough about the food and service. It's all been top notch. The owners are very friendly and always check in to chat and make sure everything is perfect. We will miss Bisonte when we heard back home at the end of March."}
{"text":"Very good food always a good delivery time yet when it comes the fried food they put it in styrofoam containers which keeps it insulated and makes it very soggy--"}
{"text":"You have pizza and wings?  Can we be best friends forever?

Bisonte Pizza, I apologize, you were not in my radar until recently, but considering I do not venture into the gateway area of Uptown as much... it's totally my fault.

Came here after a fun evening with a large group.  We just needed food in our bellies to soak up all the champagne and wine we had be partaking and pizza sounded like a great means to an end.

It was a weeknight (Thursday)... so not very busy... we sat at the long communal table, however this place has plenty of other tables and even another section (maybe to rent out for parties?).  TVs lined the walls so a good sports watching venue as well.

Server was super nice and patient as we were a large group and she was super accommodating.  We ended up splitting pizza and wings between the 7 of us and it hit the spot.  Their wings were especially notable cause of the char on the tips and then the glaze was just the right amount.. not too soggy and not too dry.  The pizza was solidI will have to come back

Probably the one ding is that the parking deck... we may have not gotten the memo on validation or anything, but it seemed like a pain - maybe because we lost our ticket and we ended up paying the max $14 for the day parking.  I believe this is plenty of street parking... probably metered, but my mind was clearly on the food for the evening so I think that's the only ding I would give them with this location, but everything else was excellent."}
{"text":"Authentic Buffalo pizza and wings! I'm a Buffalo native so I was sooooo happy when I found out about Bisonte!"}
{"text":"Bisonte classic was really good. Best pizza in Charlotte!  Perfect pizza.  Great atmosphere and attentive service even a busy game day. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in the area. I won't give it 5 stars because it's not located in New York City. They have two styles, thick and thin, both delicious. The crust really stands out, tastes close to NY quality. They also have good specialty pizza, wings and pizza rolls. The pizza is pretty expensive and there are cheaper options in the area that are good but, in my opinion, not as good as this place. Oh, one more thing, they make a pizza egg roll, definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Penne with Alfredo sauce was soooo good- portion was huge!! They also make the BEST blue cheese I have EVER had. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I knew this place from it's Matthews location. The Charlotte location even tops that for a great slice of pizza."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to this place today lunch. I had been craving Wings and pizza all week long, but flies were on the pizza so I opted for wings only. I ordered the six which is called a single medium wing and my daughter ordered the double medium one and a barbecue Bourbon style we also ordered mozzarella sticks and fries for an appetizer. The mozzarella sticks came out hot but the french fries were cold I did ask for replacement fries and they were steaming hot when they came out. The wings came out and they were hot freshly cooked. However after eating them on our way home my daughter and I became sick. It was hours that followed of bathroom time before we felt better. I did contact The Establishment and the management spoke with me and assured me that there was no cross-contamination, however my daughter and I were sick for a reason and it was the only place we had eaten that day. I just wanted to inform the restaurant before I yelped about my experience. I was surprised because my daughter and I have eaten at the one uptown and didn't have any adverse effects after eating the food. Nothing was really offered for our experience."}
{"text":"I went to this place after my friend who is also from Buffalo went there and gave it great reviews. So I tried it tonight and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the 6 mild wings and they were fried to perfection. The mild sauce is seriously mild so our waitress Gena brought me a lil medium and it was really good. Their blue cheese and ranch they make it themselves and it taste like Buffalo overall it was really good."}
{"text":"Best pizza and no doubt....wings in town. Great service and staff. A must visit. If you live in town or are visiting the queen city, check them out."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for some wings and pizza and saw on Yelp this place carried things found in Buffalo NY.

The wings are some of the best I've had in Charlotte thus far. They weren't soggy and had a little crisp to them. Sauce was flavorful. The blue cheese is amazing - lots of fresh blue cheese chunks.

The pepperoni pizza was great! The pepperoni curls up with a little bit of grease inside. In my opinion, the best way to eat pepperoni on a pizza. As a cold pizza lover, I liked the pizza better the next day than hot. 

If you like beef on weck, I still think Lebowskis has the best but it's not bad here. 

I will be ordering this again! Next time, I want to try one of their speciality crusts like the garlic. It's not an additional cost which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Bisonte is a good choice - I only wish (like Poppy Seeds, at the other end of the strip mall), that they were closer. Of course, that would mean that I would eat there more frequently, and that would probably be bad for both my waist and my wallet. So they are probably in a good location.

The place is not fancy, as we are looking at a fairly typical strip mall space after all. But it is serviceable if you are going for lunch or to pick up your order. Staff is friendly and will help you with your order. The oddity here is if you are on your first time, the \"place your order\" is at the end of the counter, and the slices are at the beginning. It's not really a problem, just a bit awkward if you are ordering slices is all.

While the prices may seem high if you are ordering a pie, those sheets are on the large size, so keep that in mind. If you only want a taste, get a slice, and the price isn't bad at all. And if you don't want pizza, go for the wings. Definitely a great flavor to them."}
{"text":"This is seriously one of my favorite pizza places plus it's a local business! Their dough is amazing. There hasn't been a time where there is a bubble on the pizza!! We always get buffalo style. It's fluffy and airy and just plain delicious! Their Toppings are great too! 

Wings are awesome as always. Meaty and huge!! We love their homemade dressings! We always get the hot flavor. One day we are gonna try the inferno flavor. 

Their lunch specials are good too! They also have daily specials through the week!"}
{"text":"Yum! I've been to the Matthews location and was super surprised at how different this location compares. You have a hostess and a server at this location. I love the decor. The staff is friendly too! We got a couple slices of pizza and the buffalo hot wings. The hot wings were piping hot and it paired well with the ranch. The slices are so good. We got cheese and pepperoni. It's fluffy and airy and not crunchy which I love. I would definitely come back to this place. It's just so good!!"}
{"text":"Such a treat! I've never had buffalo style pizza before but I like it! The restaurant is decorated very nice and the air conditioning is nice and cool on a hot day. It's a little off he beaten path of what I consider uptown, more on the way to midtown. However, it tastes amazing. The pizza roll ups were good but I probably wouldn't get them again. The slices were delicious. The philly cheese steak was by far my favorite. Also the fries are hand cut and taste so fresh!"}
{"text":"I've honestly never had \"Buffalo Style\" pizza before, even though I've been to Buffalo several times (I always eat wings or a good beef on weck when I'm in town). So I figured I'd give it a shot. I was very pleasantly surprised! We ordered takeout - a pizza for the family and some wings to see how they compared to wings in Buffalo.

The wings were great - meaty, plenty of buffalo sauce, and good homemade blue cheese. I didn't order the specialty wings, which I probably should have. These didn't really represent what I've eaten in Buffalo very well - more like what we in the South are accustomed to for \"Buffalo\" wings. But they were good nonetheless. Next time, I'll go for specialty wings, though.

The pizza was fantastic - a good departure from what we're used to in Charlotte, from the many  chains, NY style, Neapolitan style, and build-it-yourself pizza joints. We stuck with the basics - pepperoni and Italian sausage. The pepperonis were tiny, but plentiful and flavorful - the kind that curl up while baking (my favorite). I would prefer more finely crumbled Italian sausage, but it was still good. Next time, double pepperoni for me!

Now as far as the crust goes, I'm probably going to commit some sort of blasphemy to Western New Yorkers in my description (so forgive my lack of knowledge about Buffalo-style pizza). And by that, I'd say it's a cross between NYC-style and Chicago-style. The pizzas/slices are large like NYC style, but the crust has a certain fluffiness to it reminiscent of a less-deep Chicago-style deep dish. It kind of gave the best of both worlds. Normally, I wouldn't think this description would be all that appealing if I were reading it, but biting into a slice with that fluffy-in-the-middle, but crisp-on-the-outside crust was very nice in fact. Great flavors, great pizza - my wife and I both enjoyed it thoroughly, and it was nice to have a different type of pizza than we were used to.

I'll most certainly be back. I need to try those specialty wings, as well as give the beef on weck a shot, not to mention that this will be one of our new go-to spots for pizza!"}
{"text":"Ok first -- I am not from Buffalo NY.  But wow. These guys have it figured out. This is an adult pizza joint.  Well \"engineered\" 'za. 

The crust is crispy AND chewy.  The sauce is savory. The toppings--fantastic, fresh. flavorful. 

Try the Bisonte Classic.  22 minutes in the 500-degree oven turns this pile of fresh ingredients into a magnificent blend of meaty peppery cheesy goodness. 

You've been warned!!"}
{"text":"Bisonte Pizza has a daily two-slice pizza special: cheese, pepperoni or some specialty pizza (classic is my favorite). I also like their spaghetti (with meat sauce or meatball). The staff knows me by name and is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good plain cheese pizza! And I say that as a New Yorker used to New York thin crust pies. Let me explain that. So initially I was disappointed as it's a thicker pizza and NOT a crispy crust. BUT then I tasted it! And I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised. I equate the texture to ur standard NY sicilian pie which is a fav of mine. Their sauce and cheese are super tasty. I also order cheese sticks w fries to give those a try. Again, wonderful flavor for both! Only got thru half of those and my slices so lunch for tomorrow is covered too!

Only 2 downsides. One. It took SO long to get the food. FOR 2 slices and some fried sides 30 mins is a bit too long in my book. Second, and I really hate to mention it cause I know this will freak some folks out but I did find a small piece of hair on my plate under one of the slices. Eww yes but not gonna make me sick eww (like being served and eating raw chicken like at another place I could mention). Would have been worse if it was actually IN the food. But the manager came over, apologized and offered to make good with replacements so that satisfied me. It's food service and things like that can happen. 

So all in all I'll definitely return  very delicious meal :-)"}
{"text":"Bisonte means buffalo in Italian. How do I know that? The Internet. 

When in Rome (or in this case a Buffalo restaurant in Matthews), one has no choice but to bring a true Buffalonian to put it to the test. Reido was stoked to see they had Loganberry in cans. This is a Buffalo born drink... sweet, not carbonated. He finished it way before our food came out to the table. 

After a careful study of the menu, we decided on splitting a Buffalo style pepperoni pizza and a 12''Stinger sub. Reido schooled me that the dough for Buffalo style is a little thicker than a New York style. It was delicious. Reido said it was some of the better Buffalo style pizza he's had down here in Charlotte at the transplant restaurants like these. For the Stinger, we had our chicken fingers dipped in a mix of hot and barbecue. I didn't see barbalo as a sauce option, but they did it on request. Steak, cheese, chicken fingers... that's a winning combination. Reido was most impressed by the bread. He said it's super Buffalo authentic

I thought it was worth the drive to check out Bisonte. I want to come back and try the wings and pizza logs. I've never had a log of pizza, but it sure does sound delicious."}
{"text":"The homemade bleu cheese- WORTH EVERY DAMN CALORIE. So good. 

I've always been a big fan of their Matthews location and am so happy there is finally one much closer to me. This one is in Gateway Village. Skip the parking deck and grab a spot on the street (all full? Make sure to look across the street at the inbound side as well).

Bisonte means buffalo in Italian. There are two styles of pizza crust here: Buffalo (a little thicker) and New York. You can also get free specialty crusts (sesame, cajun, onion, butter, garlic, parmesan). They also do pizza by the slice. My favorite pie here is the Bisonte Classic (pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, hot peppers, black olives, Italian sausage, capicola). Such a great combination of toppings. I also love their Steak Bomber (like a philly). The wings are delicious, my friends love the Stinger (steak and chicken fingers sub). 

Specials: 
MONDAY: $1.00 off any 12\" sub
TUESDAY: $3.50 off a large cheese +1 topping pizza
WEDNESDAY: $1.00 off any order of pasta

This location is way different than the Matthews one. It's huge. Full bar available. If you're a Bills fan, you'll love this spot."}
{"text":"Their award winning wings are a must! The Wings are absolutely awesome!!!!
Pizza is really good too, we tried the bizonte classic. Really nice personnel and great service."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would.  It's horrible, I'm predicting  they will not be in business in a year.  The staff is rude to say the least.  The time it took to get 2 plain cheese slices reheated which were already made was more than 20 minutes on a Sunday.  (there was only 1 other customer who clearly knew a worker and totally  jumped ahead of me to order a specialty slice).. BTW,  there was 3 pizza makers working.... All standing around talking to each other n watching football.  

This place is just the worst.  Your better off going to Harris Teeter  next door to get a take n bake or frozen pizza.  

Horrible pizza, which taste like & smells like way too much tomato sauce with a too thick crust..... #notgoodpizza #dontwasteyourmoney"}
{"text":"Couldn't make split pizza, prices way too high.  The highest I ever seen on a pizza. $26 for a large is ridiculous.  Athens pizza down the road was a lot better and cheaper and tasted better."}
{"text":"Just moved here from NY. Had pizza yesterday it was terrific reminded me of the pizzas in the Bronx. Had the calzone and a veal parm hero tonight, only thing I can say is this is my pizza place from now on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizzeria!  The food is delish and the staff is amazing!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. We enjoyed the pizza & mozz sticks. Looking forward to going back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Best wings south of Buffalo!!! Beef on weck is awesome, never had a bad meal here!!! Calzones, pizza & pasta are really good also."}
{"text":"In walking distance,  but we never do-even for a slice and beer. That should tell you all. 

The owner is gruff and the pizza is overpriced with a sauce I don't care for. 

Parking lot by the teet and Poppyseed bagels (highly recommend) outside tables and delivery."}
{"text":"My fiance' is a wing lover.....it's his FAVORITE item to eat and trust and believe that he has eaten at many....many....many wing places. 3 weeks ago his friend told him about Bisonte and hands down there wings are the BEST!!! 
He's ordered the California Gold wings 4 times in 3 weeks!!!!!
THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We grew up in Buffalo where there we many options of delicious pizzas, but moving to NC we have had a hard time finding any good pizza or wings that tastes nearly like Buffalo pizza. We were thrilled when Bisonte opened. The pizza and wings are delicious and the best in the area. The down side for us is Matthews is a hike for us. We wish they were closer so we could order more."}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch place! Pizza has a good taste and is not expensive.  They have a few different lunch choices as well.  The place is clean, people are friendly and I would go back again."}
{"text":"This was my second try of this place and I was really not happy with a few things. 
- The food is way, way overpriced for what it is. I haven't cared for the pizza, the wings, or the subs. Everything I've tried has been either burned, dry, slimy, lacking sauce, or just not cooked right. Yeah, I could've said something, but I'll touch on that later.
- It takes forever which is horrible when you have 60 minutes for lunch and - no exaggeration - 20 of it is waiting. My first try was after the \"dinner rush\" and well before closing time. We were the only people in the restaurant and it still took forever. 
- The staff are disengaged and do literally a walking fly-by asking you how your food is while simultaneously hustling to get away from you so you have no time to answer. If you attempt to make eye contact outside of ordering, they immediately go somewhere else, or look away. It's like they want you to go away now that you've paid and they put food in front of you. This has happened on both occasions with multiple staff members. 
Just do yourself a favor and don't bother. Maybe delivery is a better experience, but I have no interest in trying that."}
{"text":"We had company over so I ordered a sheet pizza, a large pizza and 50 chicken wings. When I went to pick it up I was told there was a mixup and the wings were ready but the pizzas had just gone into the oven.  
Yes there was a mistake but the owner immediately asked me if I wanted anything while I waited, a beer a soda whatever. Then he came over to me and asked how many people were at my house waiting for dinner, I told him 8. He then said he was sending 8 cannolis home with me for free. Every business makes mistakes from time to time but acknowledging the mistake and making it right with your customer is something most places don't do these days. 
There's a reason I drive 25 min out of my way for this place. Great food & great customer service!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from Bisonte Pizza. I am from Buffalo originally and miss the pizza places back home. The sub I ordered was great! Could have used more veggies, but still good. I also got a cookie and I came warm! I'd definitely order takeout again, but this time I'm trying their pizza."}
{"text":"This place is horrible .. sauce is like water and the service is pathetic . Took 40 min to serve 2 slices and the restaurant was at 25% capacity. They have no idea what they're doing."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here every time we want pizza and wings. It's about a 20 minute drive for us but sooooo worth it. Bleu cheese and ranch dressing are to die for! Wings are always crispy and love the lil pepperoni!"}
{"text":"I had no idea what buffalo style pizza was until tonight. Yummy!

A cute little spot in a small, strip mall, Bisonte Pizza Co lived up to its 2014 \"Best Pizza\" distinction. 

Buffalo style is a thick crust but not \"doughy\". I ate the pizza all the way to and including the crust, something I don't usually do. We had a large pizza (17\") and added 18 wings which was more than enough for our family of four. The wings were very good, too. We had a mixture of mild and carolina gold. Carolina gold is a blend of barbecue and a mustard sauce. Very good!

Staff was friendly and responsive. Definitely a good spot to watch a game. I will just take a jacket next time. I nearly froze and the temperature made our pizza cool too quickly."}
{"text":"My son and I went in here on a Saturday around noon. I read about the place on Big Time Bites blog. As a Bills fan, that was just a big time plus.  Although I am not from Buffalo (or Western NY), I have spent a lot of time there on business.  I became a Bills fans after Jerry Butler (Clemson) sort of befriended me (long story) when I helped my dad at his ice cream store in Clemson on weekends as a young kid.

Anyway... Bisonte....

I have eaten at all the \"hot spots\" in the Buffalo area and I can tell you the wings here are L-E-G-I-T.  Crisp on the outside and hot, steamy and flavorful on the inside.  Good size too.  

Pizza - we got it \"Buffalo Style\"... a little thicker crust.  We will get it \"New York Style\" next time to compare.  We got pepperoni and they use those nickel sized pepperonis that cup up when you cook them.  Fantastic.

Fries - I saw that had fresh cut and I am a real sucker for those.  They were excellent.

Blue Cheese - had to edit my review as I forgot to mention the Blue Cheese.  Oh My God... the Blue Cheese.  Homemade and out of this world good.  We didn't get celery with our wings.  I wonder of they don't offer celery???

Beef On Weck - We did not get (see heart attack waiting to happen meal choices above).  But, this is a western NY specialty and I look forward to giving it a try next trip.

Anyone know if they are a \"Bills Bar\" on NFL Sundays?

Service - excellent.  She was very friendly and attentive.  

HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place."}
{"text":"Very nice local restaurant great Wings Great Subs good pizzaVery nice local restaurant great Wings great sub good pizza. Try their wonderful hand cut fries."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today with some friends.  It's a little bit out of the way, but I think it's worth the trip if you're in the neighborhood.

There are two doors and two counters in the restaurant.  Enter on your left for dine-in, place your order, and your food will be brought out to you.  Enter on your right for carry-out.

I decided to order the meatball sub and a side of fries.  The sub was excellent!  The bread was soft and the meatballs, which are made in-house were terrific.  The fries were average.  I asked them if they could do some garlic fries and they used garlic salt to season them for me.

The staff was very friendly and I observed them assisting carry-out customers by actually carrying orders out to their cars.

If this place was closer, I'd frequent it weekly.  When I'm in the neighborhood, I will definitely stop back!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, a bit too greasy for my taste and mushy crust, but good pepperoni and pretty quick despite other reviews. I only ordered one slice to go though, so not much to go by!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Friday at 12:20. We didn't get our food until 12:55 and the place was empty so we were a little confused as to why it took so long to get our food. So needless to say I didn't have a good opinion of the place by the time we got our food. That being said the food was pretty good. I got a slice of pizza and a small Greek salad. I would come back to give them another chance but when we finally paid and walked out it was 1:25 which is kind of ridiculous for a place that people come to for lunch."}
{"text":"First time last night. Bourbon wings, Italian sandwich, and Greek salad were all very very good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Boneless wings and fries are awesome. An added bonus is you can get pizza by the slice with two extra toppings at no extra charge. Dave the bar tender makes a great Long Island."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a large group of coworkers (12 or so) and we all ordered wings. Both the songs and the service were excellent. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to give this pizza place a try.  The food was good and we got our pizza buffalo style. They also can to a pizza ny style. It was filling and would definitely recommend"}
