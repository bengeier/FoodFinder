{"text":"I've been to some pretty authentic Cuban restaurants and in all honesty, just by looking at some menus of the Cuban restaurants in downtown Toronto, it's not all that appealing to me. This place however, has a very simple yet authentic menu (with the exception of their fries).  First thing that caught my eye were the churros, second are the churros.  If you know me well, you know my undying love for churros.  After being told by a couple of friends about this place, I finally made it out and on the stormiest Spring day.  I heard that they are generally quite busy but because of the storm, I was able to have a chat with one of the owners, Michelle, who is obviously passionate about the place. And their food proves just that.

Churros - They were freshly fried and I personally also love just the plain ones with the cinnamon sugar.  And ohmahgoodniz, they were amazing. The size was generous and the price was just right. Had the perfect crunch on the outside and moisture inside. I also love how it's not overly greasy like how some are.  Will DEFINITELY go back for these. 5/5.

Cubano Sandwich - Probably my most favourite sandwich.  I would even drive 1.5 to 2 hours for a Cubano sandwich (@ Cheesecake Factory at Walden Galleria).  Now I won't have to anymore since this is only a 15 minute drive away! It is also very simple with the regular ingredients. What I love about this sandwich is their choice of lean pork slices. For once I didn't sit here cutting out the fat.  It was also a very very generous size.  Very generous that I only had half of the sandwich.  5/5.

Fries - All sandwiches come with regular/plain fries and it was also quite enjoyable.  They're similar to Costco fries but with seasoning and just the right amount.  Although just eating the fries on its own was delicious, some kind of condiment would go nicely with it.  I made myself some mayo & ketchup to dip it in.  Was also quite a generous serving. 5/5."}
{"text":"Slow roasted chicken and fried fish were both great. The chicken was fall off the bone perfection. Fish was perfectly fried. Loved the black bean rice which was filling and yummy. Of course had to try one of the many churros options. Will definitely be back to try the sandwiches and coffee."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant tonight after getting an email from Yelp on new places that opened up in the area.   I want to start off by saying my daughter and I just had the best churro, ever.   It was just the right size to have copious amounts of the the amazing crunchy exterior with just enough chewy interior to provide the textural contrast.  Taste and mouth feel were on point.   

We also tried the cheese fries.   They were very good!   Since I already had dinner prior to coming to this restaurant, I did not have too much of the fries, which made my daughter and her friend.   I look forward to returning to try their Cuban sandwiches."}
{"text":"The sandwich were awesome and the loaded fries, except the vegetarian one meh.... not enough avocado and the cheese was processed! so the churros were quite disappointing! They were thin and not fresh! You would think that you call yourself a Churrobar, your churros would be exceptional! I've had better at the CNE's food truck! I'd come back for the sandwich thou!"}
{"text":"Found this place on a whim as I sometimes go to the Filipino bakery next door. I'm so glad I found this place because it is SO GOOD! They are fairly new, only been open for 2-3 months. Service was great. Churros are so fricking delicious. And the food was really good. The main entrees come with rice and a side. I would give 5 stars but I wasn't aware that we could pick our side because she didn't tell us. I asked her what are the sides and she said \"yucca\" so I just assumed there was only one side. I came back a second time and asked again if I could get something else other than yucca and she said yes, so I got the plaintains. The marinated yucca side was kind of sour and was really off-putting. 

They also offer churro sundaes, which really speaks to my foodie heart - will have to try one next time.

Overall, this is a definitely a place I will keep coming back to and I hope they are here to stay!"}
{"text":"Excellent place especially in Scarborough and super cheap. One of (if not the only) Cuban place in the Scarborough area. Located in a small & random plaza, the resto has an authentic feel to it. Note that there are only 2 tables and a small counter to eat, so don't expect to have a spot to sit and eat especially for a larger group. Staff was friendly, place was clean and food was great. We ordered the fish , veggie sandwich , chicken sandwich and churros of course. Sandwiches came with fries even though it doesn't specify that on the sandwich. Fries were super crispy! Fish was by far my favourite- their rice and peas were amazing. Wouldn't recommend the veggie sandwich, really had no flavour/anything special but the chicken sandwich made up for it! So good. Churros were evenly coated with sugar/cinnnamon and were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Definitely would recommend and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I think I would've liked this place more if I got something else on the menu. I got the chicken sandwich and it was okay...I love onions but there was WAY too many grilled onions in this thing, and the sauce in the sandwich itself wasn't anything amazing either. I did like the fries however. I didn't end up trying the churros."}
{"text":"Cuban food is very underrepresented in Toronto and Im so glad scarborough has one. Seems like a family run spot, with a husband and wife running it. Its barelt got any seats in the actual place, so i suggest doing takeout and enjoying at home. 

I got the pork shoulder with plantains and picadillo fries. Both were very good, but none that blew me away. For the price point (12.99 for the pork shoulder, 7.99 for the fries) the portion is very generous. We also got a free churro with SPC. The churro was warm and crispy, everything you would want in a churro. The churros are very cheap, 2 bucks for a specialty churro and $15 for 12. Definitely getting a specialty one next time I come back. 

The food itself deserves a 3/5; i thought the picadillo was a little salty and the pork could he marinated a little more, but the price, friendly service and unique cuisine. I will definitely return and reccomend anyone try it."}
{"text":"Yummy churros! Dropped by here for the churros and it was amazing. The churros was warm, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Bf and I got the cookies and cream churro and 3 of the classic churros to go. The cookies and cream churros was covered in condensed milk and Oreo crumbles, was yummy! When we got home we melted some good old peanut butter and spread it on the classic churros, it tasted  just as amazing. Like a peanut butter cup."}
{"text":"I came here craving for churros and definitely got my churros fix. They're soft and crunchy and not too sweet. You can order them plain with chocolate/syrup dip or you can get their custom decadent churros that come with different toppings like cookies and cream. 

I also tried their pork shoulder with rice and cheesy fries. The cheesy fries were amazing and it was a really good mix of cheese and beef. The pork shoulder was good and I could imagine myself eating this in Havana. I really liked the potato/plantain that comes with it. It's like mash potato but a little sour. 

Overall the food was really good. Just the right amount of flavour. Nothing was bland or too salty. Just the way I like it. I will definitely be back to try the different decadent churros and the fries. The service was also really good. 

There are only a few bar seats so it's good for takeout for the mean time until more tables and seats are in."}
{"text":"This place is located in a small plaza behind attached to a gas station so it may not be something you notice. But with the power of yelp you may come here with the same curiosity that we did. 

The interior is simplistic yet fun with the black chalk walls, black chairs, and tables. And the fun of course was the chalky decorations that is also their churro menu. It wasn't immediately apparent to us where to order but also the one and only person working there was working on making someone else's order, hence was not behind the cashier. 

They serve a full lunch and sides on their main menu but we were there for churros. There serve classic cinnamon churros in varying quantities, gourmet churros which is really a combination of the toppings that they carry (so you can also make a custom gourmet churro) and various sundaes. All these options were explained by the very helpful and nice attendant there as well as it's listed on their picture frame wall behind the cashier (should have taken a picture). Oh yeah and churro ice cream sandwiches as well as just regular ice cream sandwiches. 

On to the churros review and our order. We were just here to try so we only go 3 classic churros, 1 cookies and cream gourmet churro (condensed milk and Oreo dust). These churros have a nice crunchy exterior with a softer doughy centre. Compared to some other churro experiences these did not seems to be done to order (but there was already some customers so they may have made some in advance) but when dressed they tasted pretty good. 

The alfajores we bought had like a short bread cookie base, caramel, and topped with meringue. Too sweet for my liking but my partner really enjoyed them but we also bought the larger one (they have to sizes). 

We brought the 3 classic churros home. FYI they do not keep as well the next day. The crunchiness become more hard and the inside do have that pastry staleness. I would recommend eating all the churros once you buy them from the store or shortly afterwards. 

Definitely worth coming back to try a sundae or lemonade or have a freshly made churro to see if how well the churros age. And of of course try the Cuban food."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday evening around 7:30 and it was pretty quiet. I wasn't super hungry so decided to try the picadillo fries and churro. We didn't know what picadillo was so asked the lady at the cash who seemed like she could care less told us it was bits of beef. The owner was also there cleaning up some tables and ignored us completely. This was surprising to me as previous reviews mentioned how nice and friendly everyone is there. Maybe it was an off day???

Anyway, the fries were just okay. It's pretty much fries supreme from Taco Bell without the sour cream. In fact, while I was eating it I felt like it could use some sour cream. The churros were just okay as well. I've had better downtown Toronto but for a quick fix uptown it will do the job. 

I don't know if I'll be back to try their Cuban food. Hopefully their customer service will be improved."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, I saw a picture of the churro sundae on instagram and had to try it.

Previous reviews seem to complain about lineups but at 2.30 on a Friday we were the only people in the restaurant and took our time looking at the menu and making our choices.

I work down the street from here so we went on our lunch break. Food and dessert was made fresh and we ate at the bar at the window. There's not a lot of seating. Just three seats at the bar and two chairs at one table but it looks like they're working on changing that so it's all good.

Didn't catch the name of the girl who was working but she was super helpful and totally patient with us taking way too long to order.

We had the main dish of fried fish, an order of Cuban Fries and an order of the Cuban corn. Holy portion sizes. They are huuuuge. And really reasonably priced. Mains are like 12.99, sandwiches are 10, fries like 7.99 and the corn was 5.99 I think. All the food was super delicious. There was a lot of the mayo on the corn but it's easily scraped off depending on your preferences.

Now, the actual reason I came here. The dessert! The churro itself is super tasty. Definitely fresh and just the right amount of soft. I expected vanilla soft serve but it's more of a tart taste which isn't unpleasant just different! The galaxy sundae comes with a blue syrup which is just the right amount of sweet and this super fun candy that kind of cracked in your mouth!

For those who care, they take credit cards on orders over $6!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken in tomato sauce and some churros. Chicken was moist and tender, churros were fresh! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times I was totally impressed by both the service and more importantly, the food ! The first time was for a late night dinner after a movie date night. We had the pulled pork sandwich and the sweet plantains, both were cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious ! The pulled pork had the perfect amount of sweetness and tenderness which made the sandwich incredible bite after bite. We couldn't leave without trying the churros so we bought 6 so we could share with the kids. They were kind enough to throw in a few more since they were about to close for the night and believe me, we enjoyed them all over the next couple of days. Toasted briefly in the toaster oven and they were scrumptious!

Today we went for a late lunch and again, both food and service were amazing! We had the Cuban sandwich with the Cuban fries (extra cost to upgrade) and we just had to get the pulled pork again. Today I noted the following:  friendly staff, a new layout and many more menu options including lots of desserts! I can already tell that this place is going to be a frequent hangout spot in my neighbourhood. Once again the food did not disappoint, especially the Cuban fries! It just blew my socks off! It was a meal in itself, so when my kids got home from school they dug into our leftovers and also enjoyed every bite! 

For anyone with a peanut allergy this is a very safe place to dine at. They are conscientious and aware of ingredients and only have Nutella in terms of nut related ingredients which they contain very carefully in the back. No peanuts at all! Can't wait to try every item on the menu, esp with daily specials!"}
{"text":"I got one of the classic sandwiches, which was quite tasty, but the churros were so good! Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside and freshly made. It's a small, local gem, and the lady at the counter was very friendly. However, the service was a bit slow that day. 

You can also get the churros to go with ice cream and a brownie -- decadent deliciousness."}
{"text":"I love that there is a Cuban cafe open in Scarborough to provide some variety from the countless Asian restaurants in the area. El Habanero and Churrobar is located in the same busy plaza as Baker's Best and the Canadian Petroleum gas station. We actually came here the previous night but the store had closed a few minutes early of their posted 10pm closing time. Hubby and I returned today only to find that we could not find parking within the plaza at 2:30pm on a Sunday afternoon, thus had to park on a neighboring side street and walk over. 

The cafe itself was quite busy when we first walked in. There is seating for 9 people plus additional standing room at the bar overlooking the parking lot. This really is more of a takeout and catering place than a place that you'd sit with a group to have dinner.

We ordered an El Cubano sandwich which is a delicious pressed sandwich with roasted pork, pickles, ham, mustard, and Swiss cheese. The flavours are bold and there is a nice textural contrast between the crispy bread, tender meat, melted Swiss cheese. Hubby and I shared the sandwich and couldn't even finish the yummy crispy battered fries that came with it.

They didn't have any churros available on hand at the time of our order so we waited as a fresh batch was fried up (about 10-15 minutes). We ordered two gourmet churros ($2 each) -- the Chocoholic (Nutella glazed with chocolate cookie crumbs) and Cookies and Cream (condensed milk glaze with chocolate cookie crumbs). The churros themselves were good but slightly too crispy/firm for hubby's and my liking. I hope to try the churro sundae the next time I return.

Catering is available with a preferred 2day advanced notice, including for large orders of churros!"}
{"text":"Fried Fish / Pescado Frito $9.99 (Seasoned & Lightly Battered Basa, Fried on the Spot to perfection)
- Exactly what you'd expect 
- Comes with: beans with rice + side
- Side note: I read the comments afterwards that you can choose between yuca or plantains but I wasn't asked and was just given yuca which was meh. Wish I tried the plantains instead if I knew there was a choice

Picadillo Cheese Fries $7.99 (Crispy Seasoned Fries Topped with 
Picadillo & A blend of Melted Cheese)
- :( disappointing
-----

3 Churros for $5
- Great to satisfy churro cravings. :D Would come back for this"}
{"text":"The churros range from $1.75 per churro to $2 for a gourmet churro with different dips and toppings! My friends and I bought the churro sundaes which were around $7 each after tax. They are not stingy with their toppings and taste delicious~!"}
{"text":"New addition to the area,
Finally there's Latin food that's close to home.
El Habanero focuses on traditional homemade  Cuban cuisine.
The ambiance is small, with limited seating, but they've got a good selection of hot foods and sandwiches...include the classical Cubano sandwich.
Whether you're here for Churros, which are delicious and always a hot, they've got warm meals from Arroz moros con platain, beef, pollo, etc.
The owners are very personable and sweet.
I'll definitely be back as I'll be craving some good comida Cubano!"}
{"text":"I rarely eat Cuban food and was excited to try this place out. I tried the original churros, el cubano sandwich, and pineapple pork shoulder main. Overall, nothing was spectacular but the flavours were decent. The food experience was average and I left disappointed because I had higher hopes after reading previous reviewers high ratings. 

Pineapple pork shoulder main: This was the primary disappointment because the rice was dry (as if it had been sitting on a hot counter for too long). The pork was on the dry side and I ended up not finishing it because of this. The flavours were decent, the sweetness from the pineapple combining nicely with the saltiness. 

El cubano sandwich: the sandwich will not blow you away but is solid in flavour. It was on the salty side for my taste.

Plain churros: got these freshly made and they were pleasantly tasty and not too sweet. The texture was great, crispy crunchy on the outside and soft inside."}
{"text":"Got the pineapple pork shoulder, fried fish, cookies and cream churro. Pineapple pork was extremely dry, the sauce was watery and the contents had separated from the liquid. The flavors lacked any bit of depth and complexity - everything was overpowered by the extremely sweet pineapple pieces. Fried fish was again somewhat dry, unevenly seasoned and just wholly uninspiring. The plantains were absurdly dry and the rice was unevenly cooked. I didn't think a churro could be so bad. The middle was severely undercooked to the point where it was liquidy mush, the outside was extremely hard. It was much more of a sickly sweetness than a deep fragrant sweetness that I've grown to know and love from churros. Also very slow.

EDIT IN REPLY TO OWNER:

I took one bite of the churro and didn't eat anymore. Not sure what you saw! And you didn't wait on me because that's not how takeout works? Was standing there the whole time!"}
{"text":"In a small Scarbs plaza, this place is definitely more for take-out. Looks like they might put in some more tables/chairs sometime in the future, but for now there really isn't much seating.

I came in the evening, ordered an El Cubano sandwich, the Pineapple Pork Shoulder and some churros.

The Cubano sandwich was quite tasty. Simple with the number of ingredients. Pressed and Grilled. With a nice serving of fries. The taste was good with the pickles and mustard.

The Pineapple Pork Shoulder was quite a large portion. It comes with a side of rice and Yuca. The Yuca was quite interesting, with an almost zesty flavour. Lots of contrast. It was a little oily from the pork, but overall I thought it was a good mix of textures and taste.

Lastly the churros were freshly fried to order. I couldn't help but eat one before starting the actual meal. Very yummy.

Will return!"}
{"text":"I came across this place while searching the area on Google Maps. They've only been open for three weeks and I see my Yelp buddy, JK, has already been here. Of course!

On this visit, I was on my way to meet JK for dinner so she \"suggested\" that I pick up some churros on my way. It turned out that was a good call.

The churros, although pre-made and sitting in a warmer, retained a nice crispy texture on the outside and remained soft on the inside. They can be had Classic (plain) or Gourmet (dressed with various toppings). We had the Classic, plus the Chocoholic and Cookies 'n' Cream. They were all good. Really good!

I will definitely be back for more churros and I'll have to try some of their savoury food as well."}
{"text":"I have never been to Cuba, so this review is based on how much I like the food as is.

We ordered take out dinner close to store closing time.  I had a Cubano sandwich ($10).  The flavour of the sandwich was a marriage of saltiness (ham and cheese) and sourness (pickle).  The combination tasted simple and good.  This sandwich projected a sense of down-to-earthiness.  The fries were average.  My boyfriend ordered a Pineapple Pork Shoulder main entree ($13).  The sweetness of carmelized pineapple chunks contrasted the saltiness of the pork shoulder well.  The two created a layering of flavours. BF loved the flavours symphony.  The Yuca was new to him, so there was a novelty factor.  It didn't appeal to me, though. Two thumbs up to the portion.  The entree alone could have fed us both to full.  We also ordered a few churros.  The churros were crunchy but quite dry.  It was probably because they had been sitting in the heated case for a long time. 

The services was wonderful. The lady was friendly and informative. 

El Habanero offers good food and great value.  The store format of takeout with minimal seating doesn't bother me at all.  This format is the trend for many small, independent food business nowadays."}
{"text":"I've never had Cuban food, so when I heard a place was opening up close to home, I was pretty excited! El Habanero is located in a small plaza on Steeles, between Midland and Brimley (there is a gas station). Parking may be an issue but there's a lot of street parking around since it's a residential area. This is more of a takeout place, but the owners have clearly taken some steps to make the interior somewhat cozier feeling... small things like plants. Hopefully they add more as time goes on.

Desiree, the girl working there that day was really friendly and helpful in describing the menu items and gave some recommendations. I ordered the fried fish with yuca - it was described to me as kind of potatoey vegetable. The fish was well-seasoned and freshly fried.. mains also come with your choice of rice and either plantains/yuca. The yuca surprised me - whatever they did to it made it a bit tangy tasting. I liked it but I personally preferred the plantains more as they were sweet and somewhat crisp on the outside which is more to my taste.

Portions were fair for the pricing ($12.99 for mains), though perhaps you can find cheaper food in Scarborough (not Cuban food though). Flavours overall were good.. surprisingly not as strong as I thought they'd be. It was nice though because I didn't leave needing to drink a ton of water like at other places. As said in another review, my boyfriend's stewed chicken was a bit dry but the owner was very nice about it and offered to make up for it next time.

We had the churros as well which were fresh and rolled in cinnamon sugar. It was yummy and a nice treat - it was a little harder on the outside than I would have liked but it was still good. They have specialty churros as well where you can add sprinkles or oreos and churro sundaes as well.

Overall a nice experience... will be trying their specialty fries next time!"}
{"text":"Authentic Cuban food! This restaurant is located in a tiny plaza nearby Steeles and Brimley. The restaurant space is small, so there's unfortunately not a lot of space for eating in. 

We purchased the El Cubano sandwich ($12.99), the picadillo cheese fries ($7.99) and a order of plantain chips ($5.00). The El Cubano was moist and had a lovely portion of meat and cheese, with a side of fries. The picadillo cheese fries had a great ratio of meat/cheese to potato. Also: my very picky grandmother seemed to love the plantain chips! 

The lady who took our order was sweet and friendly. I'd definitely come back to try more!

Pros: homemade, local food! Take-out friendly. Portions are great for sharing
Cons: not a lot of space to eat in"}
{"text":"Churro were perfectly made (you can tell they use fresh oil) 
The sweet plantain were perfectly fried. 
Will be back to try their mains!"}
{"text":"Came here.. AGAIN! It was time to finally try their entrees and sandwich.

Service is still just as friendly here! Dinner time is much more busy than lunch, so be prepared to wait. Since their fried items (like the fried fish) are made fresh, the woman (the owner maybe?) at the cash informed me that there would be ~10 minute wait. As such, I decided against getting anything fried because I was starrrrvinnnngggg.

Cuban Sandwich ($10) comes with fries: 
- Filled with: mustard, ham, slices of roast pork, cheese and pickles. This is a nice sandwich combination - you've got savoury and sour. The mustard, pickles, and cheese kind of feed off each other and make the sandwich quite salty. 
- Fries were fresh and seasoned well.

Pineapple Pork Shoulder ($13) comes with yuca and rice/beans:
- Flavour: It was good - nice salty and sweet flavours! But I'm also the type of person who loves pineapple on pizza, if you're not down with sweet and savoury flavours together I'd opt for something else.
- The pork itself was actually very dry despite the meat being absolutely drenched in oil. 
- The rice and beans that it came with was also way too oily. There was a puddle of oil left at the bottom of the box. 
- I also was not able to choose between plantains or the yuca. BUT... I LOVED the yuca that it came with. It's yuca con mojo so you get a very pleasant sour taste from the lime juice. Yuca (cassava) is potato-like but less starchy. I can see why some people don't like this though as it is quite sour and likely not for everyone. As such, it would be nice for the owner to offer another type of side. 
(Also, the menu says comes with slaw, but so far I haven't seen anyone get the slaw... no biggie really, but some slaw would be nice to cut the grease and heaviness)

Churros 
- They're still AMAZING. And fresh. And crispy. And rolled in cinnamon sugar goodness. YUM.

Overall, I still think the food here is a bit too salty and oily for my taste (maybe those who have a heavier palate will be okay with it). I'll be back again because El Habanero is really a welcome variety in this neighbourhood... and for the churros!"}
{"text":"Freshly made churros!! Taste really good.

I have never tried their food but it reminds me of burrito, rice and beans and marinated meat. It taste alright but not very impressive."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is great. Amazing food and friendly people. Went with my bf today and we decided to share the piccadillo fries and el cubano sandwhich as well as a heart shaped churro. We thought it might not be enough for the two of us but it was filling and the portions are good. Flavour wise it was really tasty. The meat is fresh, perfectly prepared and well seasoned, which is normally something im picky about. 
The churro was really yummy as well, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.
Definitely coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Came to this place as it was recommended by a friend. What my friend told me was that the owners used to have a home owned business selling churros before opening up their new establishment. And since there are barely any authentic churros in Scarborough, I obviously had to give it a try. At the time, the menu was limited to just churros and fries so I was only able to try their Picadillo fries ($7.99), gourmet churros ($2 each) and I ordered 12 churros for $15. The gourmet churros I chose were the chocoholic (nutella glaze w/ chocolate crumbs) and the cookies & cream (condensed milk glaze w/ chocolate crumbs). Both were warm, crunchy and tasty. Likewise, the regular churros were just as warm and crunchy (note: you can also get a side of chocolate/caramel sauce for a few cents but I thought it should've been free for combos). The Picadillo fries were made fresh to order and smelled like a fries supreme from Taco Bell (which is definitely not a bad thing); their fries obviously a much more upgraded/gourmet version but still had the fries supreme aura. I definitely want to try their other sandwiches and cuban dishes but so far the quality of their food is really good. I highly recommend trying their churros!

Downsides? It's located in a really small plaza with a gas station in the center so it's a little easy to miss. They're closed on Mondays and they have very very limited seating (just a bar table against their window). 

Note: they also offer catering services!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't have a lot of room to sit but still very nice. They started out in catering and recently opened up a store front. The Cuban food is pretty good, I ordered the stewed chicken with plantain and my girlfriend ordered fried fish with yucca. Unfortunately the chicken was kinda dry, I told them and they offered to replace it next time. The service here is absolutely 5/5. The churros were really good too, I would suggest bringing a friend and getting a box of at least 6 to eat, they are really good."}
{"text":"1.75 each or 5$ per 3 churros. 

Churros are freshly made and prepared for order. The churros are crispy and covered in sugar which was kind of overly sweet for me. I wish the fried batter was a little bit less sweet. It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside! Definitely will come back for more!"}
{"text":"So happy you FINALLY opened!!!  Hot off the plane and we had to pop by to see if there was any food left...lucky for us, was able to grab some sandwiches and a churro for our LO.
Hubby mentioned it \"took too long\" for the food, I had to remind him, this wasn't a Tim Hortons or a McDonald's!  The focus is on Freshly made flavourful food!!!
The Cubano was delicious, just as good as the last time we had it from chef Angel...as for the Chicken sandwich, phenomenal!  Soooo happy there's some delicious non-Asian food in the \"Hood\" now!!!
Can't wait till the full menu is avail...salivating just thinking about the rellenas and croquetas...yummmm!
Congrats on your GRAND OPENING!"}
{"text":"Ordered all the main combos, all were delicious! The pork mains were a bit dry, but still favourful. The standout for me was the Fried Fish. Crispy on the outside and cooked perfectly. The churros are also a treat, but smaller than expected for the price."}
{"text":"Im happy to say that this place is awesome. Good food and friendly service. The best part is that its located in Scarborough! I dont have to go downtown for good cuban food.  This joint is tucked away in a incospicuous plaza. Parking is very limited especially on the weekends.  It is more of a take out place rather than a sit down restaurant.  

First of the food is made to order, so you know its fresh.  Portion size is pretty good, enoigh to share with another person.  And for the price they charge, it is decent.

My favourites are:

Croquetas - great taste, awesome flavour even with the tangy mayo ( garlic aioli)

Cuban Fries - they didnt cheap out on these pork fries. It had big chunks of pork. Big enough portion to fill you up.

El Cubano - this sandwich brought me back to Miami when we went there 2 years ago.  Authentic cuban sandwich barnone

Chicken sandwich - the chicken was cooked perfectly. Very juicy and flavourful.  They also put the tangy mayo on it which just kicks it up a notch in flavour country ( courtesy of Guy Fieri).

Service was awesome. The lady that was serving us was very friendly and helpful.  She literally went over to our table where we were waiting for our food, and hand delivered it to us. Now thats service

Overall the experience was great, and would definitely come back and try the other food on the menu"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp today, and I decided to give this place a try!

Wow. I am amazed. This place has the best El Cubano sandwiches ever. It comes with some fries, and they taste great.

I also ordered their churros, and they taste soft and delicate with the right amount of sweetness.

I would HIGHLY recommend this place to my friends and family to try. Taste is king, and this place delivered it to perfection."}
{"text":"El Habanero is located in a small plaza on Steeles so its easy to miss it but I do recommend it to anyone who likes Cuban food. The interior is spacious but not a lot of seating. I guess most people order take out since it is located near a residential area.

We ordered 6 Churros and a Cubano Sandwich. The Sandwich had ham, cheese, pickles and topped with mustard (I think?) and it was delicious. It also came with fries which were a great addition. When we got there, they have just finished making a fresh set of Churros so the ones we got were nice and warm.

After reading a few reviews I did notice a lot of people had a hard time since it was busy so I was glad to see that they weren't overflowing with people when I went it. The service was fast and friendly and I can't wait to come back because their food was super crave worthy."}
{"text":"After work on a Friday, the age old question arose (What's to eat for dinner?). Decided to stop by El Habanero as I saw so many postings on instagram stating how great this place was. It's in a hidden away area behind a gas station.

The menu was not extensive but what they had to offer was pretty tasty. My husband and I both got the slow roasted pork with pineapple, cassava and rice with beans. The meal was pretty amazing as the pork was absolutely tender and flavourful because of the pineapple. It went really well with the rice and beans. As for the cassava, I didn't expect it to have a tartness to it which was a good surprise.  Next time, I will try the churros. The meal portions were pretty big and I couldn't finish in one sitting."}

A hearty sandwich packed with the taste of Cuba.
*note: the chef had previously cooked in Havana for 15 years

Earlier tonight, my best friend and I dropped in half an hour before close to grab a bite. This restaurant was strongly recommended by another friend.
*note: this restaurant has only been open for 4 months

The pulled pork sandwich that we chose to share was incredibly delicious. The pork is well seasoned and perfectly paired with a refreshing slaw, generously packed between a burger bun. :)

The fries are cooked to perfection with a light seasoning and the perfect balance between crunchy exterior and potato-ey interior!

^^ Sandwich and fries for $10, a portion to feed two of myself, very VERY worth it n.n

Sorry to say, but I wasn't too fond of the milk'n cookies churros sundae. The churros on top was great, but the ice-cream was overly sweet (even for me, and I love sugar) and had a sandy texture from perhaps ice or sugar. The cookie and cookie dough bits were too obviously packaged. :(

However, this small family-owned joint is a polished gem in the middle of a food-lined street, Steeles Ave. The owner was very very friendly and I will be sure to return with friends and try their other dishes! n.n

*note: the landlord had told the owner that the gas at the station in the same plaza (some sketchy small gas station brand) comes from the same distributor as PetroCanada, whereas the price is notably lower......interesting :P"}
{"text":"Was driving on steeles and saw a new sign up in the plaza by brimley that caught my eye - El Habanero. 

Glad to finally have a legit Latin restaurant in the area.

Service - the owner was very informative and helpful but most of all very passionate about the quality of food she provides.

Food - we ordered the picadillo fries which were very flavourful but most importantly the fries were not soggy even though they were smothered with all that cheese and beef.

Also had the el cubano which was roasted pork, cheese, ham, and pickles.

Overall a great place for Latin food uptown!!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork fries are insanely good and the Cuban is by far the BEST I have ever had! Small restraint with limited tables but fits the vibe perfectly! The ladies working are extremely nice and you can tell they love what they are doing! Please visit!"}
{"text":"A wholesome family restaurant with amazing food!! 

This is about 15 mins from me and I've seen great reviews from friends so I was excited to try it out! I love Cuban food and this place is authentic! As soon as you see the Canadian Petro gas station on Steele's, drive into that plaza and you're in the right place!

This isn't listed anywhere so you do have to ask! 

The family is so sweet, kind, and welcoming. They make all their food fresh to order. There's seating for 15 people at high chairs and tables. It's small so it's good to get food to go, or eat there if you have a small group. I got the Cuban corn, Picadilly fries, 6 churros, and the mango parfait with churros on top. Everything was DELICIOUS!!! It was 35 degrees in Scarborough, and she made the mango parfait first so I could eat it and cool down! It was one of the most delicious mango desserts I've ever had, and I try a lot of mango desserts and churros in general! They're my favourite. 

Cuban corn - corn on the cob with cilantro mayo with hints of spice and breaded crumbs. So delicious!

Picadilly fries - a huge order! Easily can be shared with 2-3 people. Fries are good when they're hot and crispy! 

Churros - AMAZING! Fresh to order and hot. Huge portions, thick, very crispy on the outside, thick and chewy but soft on the inside. Good dose of cinnamon sugar! Does not come with dip or filled, but you can order a dip on the side or get gourmet churros! 

Mango parfait - amazing!! Mango ice cream, mango pieces, condensed milk, whipped cream, churro pieces on top! So delicious and comes with a lid for you to eat it on the go! 

All of this cost me $30, and it was so filling! All the food is filling, great portions, so delicious and tasty authentic Cuban food. 

I will definitely return again to try more!!!!!"}

I've been craving for churros ever since I got back from Spain. This is also so close to home so I had to try it when I heard about it. 

It's located in a small plaza on Steeles that I would honestly never think to go to if I hadn't heard of this place beforehand. They've been open for a month and were solely focused on catering prior to that. 

It's small but spacious so it doesn't feel crowded. As I came in a group of three, we took up all the counter seats by the window. There are still a couple of seats in the corner but there are no tables there. I felt bad because everyone who came in after us (and there was quite a bit) had to get takeout for this reason. 

I tried the regular churros, cookies and cream churros, and the Cuban fries. Churros are deliciously crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. I prefer the original churros over the Cookies and Cream - it's good in moderation but a little too sweet for my taste if I have the entire thing.  I could eat 2-3 of the original ones though!

The Cuban fries are super crispy. Think Costco fries but thinner. At first I thought it was a little pricey (~$9 after tax) but the portion was huge and there was a generous amount of pork. If you have an average appetite, you wouldn't be able to finish this by yourself.

The lady working there was very sweet. She came over to offer us the wifi and was so apologetic that she didn't provide it to us earlier (even though we never asked!).

Right now it's sitting at 3.5 stars for me. I'd like to go back and try the sandwiches and mains."}
