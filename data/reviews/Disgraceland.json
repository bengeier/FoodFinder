{"text":"Disgraceland isn't bad, but it's definitely a bit overrated. Thier biggest fault is that it's completly hit-or-miss. Somedays everything comes together, other times... 

Their menu takes an exceptionally creative look at stuff you'd expect to find in the southern states with heavy concern for those that prefer meatless. Everything from Southern-fried chicken and Tenessee pulled pork sandwiches to grilled veg stew and fried tofu sandwiches. They also have a fairly original selection of sauces to dip your fries in that's worth mentioning. The staff are cool, layed-back, and they actually seem to care that you're there.

But like I said, all of that can change the next time you go in. Food could come out luke warm and greasy, staff could be stuck-up and simply not care. 

Disappointingly enough, the one thing that you can count on that Disgraceland has that is consistently great, is one hell-of-a cool name."}
{"text":"I've lived in Toronto for two whole years as of this month, and I have never once had  a bad time there. More often than not, we've gone there for brunch, and the service has been stellar. Not just hey they'll bring me my order the way I asked for it, but they'll do that AND be friendly, helpful, and fast. Service is great, they have on repeat occasions gone out of their way to be accommodating (without attitude).

A big one for me is they are vegan friendly (including the best most delicious vegan caesars in town) with most brunch items available veganized (and like every other brunch place they are omnivore and lacto-ovo-vegetarian friendly too,) you sit where you want, you can play board games if you want, you can drink bottomless coffee with your brunch if you want, you can ask for their fancy cocktail menu (yes, they have one), or just check out what's on offer to drink on the chalkboard.

I'll also say, that the food is okay. Tofu scramble is hit or miss, but usually it's decent enough that even on it's worse. I've had worse tofu scrambles at places catering to vegetarians, so there is that.

I've gone with friends, I've gone with family, I've gone in pairs, I've gone in big groups. Go for brunch. It's great. Go for drinks, it's fun. 

Other stuff: Cash only (but there is an ATM inside), they have baked goods and cheesecake from Through Being Cool (vegan) bakery, and conveniently close to Nazareth Ethiopian restaurant (eat delicious Ethiopian food then go drinking)."}
{"text":"I'm of two minds when it comes to this place. One is that it's a cool, laid back joint that plays good music and has board games. The other being that the service sucks, almost to the point of making me wonder if they weren't just playing a joke on us. 

The only food I've had hear was the grilled cheese, which was delicious, if not a bit over priced (though I was told by my friend that the price is par for the course in Toronto). The menu is simple and on it you will find your standard fare. 

The service was definitely befitting of the name. Before we sat down (at 10-11pm on a weeknight) our server said, in a tone that reeked of ambivalence, that our food would take 40 minutes. I think he was actually daring us to leave. We were in no rush and happily sat down and ordered non alcoholic beverages (they also ran out of iced tea, a fact that apparently didn't even warrant an apology) and grilled cheeses. By 40 minutes the server must have actually meant 60 minutes because that's how long it took for our grilled cheeses. let me repeat that: 60 minutes for 2 grilled cheeses. 

So be warned. Should you set foot in this establishment you will likely have a good time, it will just be extremely drawn out."}
{"text":"Disgraceland is a great dive bar so set your expectations accordingly. This used to be my go-to place when I was in my 20s and lived in the neighbourhood so after a bit of a hiatus I was excited to visit the old watering hole. The place remains unchanged and still has a good vibe. However as someone else noted, I was disappointed to see that many of the original food items have been removed. The menu used to be AMAZING and the thing that kept me coming back. Now that it's different, I probably won't be visiting that often."}
{"text":"Disgraceland is a dive bar, and I mean that in the very best way.  The brunch is cheap with bottomless coffee.  The bread is Wonderbread,  the berry compote is strawberry jam, and it's all amazing.  Lots of vegan and veg options - including homemade veggie \"sausage\" and tofurkey.  

Also a great place to come and knock back drinks with friends, as long as you aren't expecting anything fancy.  Service is friendly and without attitude, as long as you are, too.  Oh, and they have a jukebox."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I are both vegetarians and were super pumped about the menu - and the beer selection. But the terrible service kind of killed our buzz. Cool atmosphere, but really, truly bad service. We waited over an hour for our food, and then found out the order was never put in... then when they finally brought it out, it was the wrong thing. 

I so wanted this to be a great experience. I'm sure it's better when it's not so busy - at least I hope."}
{"text":"I'm a longtime vegan, my boyfriend is decidedly not. Finding places for breakfast can be hard - enter Disgraceland. If you want hearty-more-than-healthy pub breakfast or brunch, disgraceland makes a great midway point for mismatched groups.

We both ordered the brekkie poutine, $9, and super filling! Came out in good time, service was friendly (even though he was the only server in the place, handling 7 tables alone), and yeah.

I've been coming here every so often when I'm in Toronto 2008, and I've never been disappointed. Keep in mind that this is a pub, primarily, so adjust your service expectations and don't bring kids after 5 PM! Always a favourite."}
{"text":"There's nothing worse than when a menu gets away with being vegan before it can taste good. As a vegan for over a decade, I was entirely underwhelmed and disappointed. I just don't get the point of it."}
{"text":"Went out with my girlfriend for what was supposed to be a quick drink and dinner. Ordered a chilli dog and she got a vegan something-or-other. The waitress came over after only 40 minutes to let us know there was a problem in the kitchen and we would receive our food shortly. Five minutes later she brought out the tiny appetizer. Our mains took another 30 minutes. We took them to-go.
Servers were alright I guess, but they didn't come over and say anything to us about the delay for 40 minutes? Bad service. But my girlfriend \"used to work in the service industry\" and had to leave a tip anyways. I get that it wasn't the server's fault, but what is the point of a tip if you can't show your dissatisfaction with it?"}
{"text":"As a vegan, Disgraceland reminds me of the dangers of restaurants offering both meat and vegan versions of the same dish. 

I was really excited to eat here. I don't live in Toronto and was just popping into the city for some quick shopping and some delicious big city vegan food. My partner and I arrived, salivated over the menu, and got a beer. The server was lovely. 

We had vegan curried poutine. Pretty good. We ate it up.

And then I ordered the vegan cuban sandwich. Apparently a wire got crossed somewhere and either the kitchen either never got the memo or they didn't read the chit.

The first bite was really weird. I wasn't sure what to expect in a vegan Cuban (fake pork, fake cheddar, avocado, pickles, etc) so I plowed through. The second bite stopped me in my tracks. I realized I was eating actual pig with actual cheese. 

As an ethical vegan, this was fundamentally revolting to me. I love pigs, hate the factory farming industry, and haven't had pork in my mouth in over a decade and a half. If you're not vegan and you think I'm being overly sensitive, try imagine being accidentally served something that you would never eat - a dog, a cat, a baby, whatever. Needless to say, I lost my appetite and didn't particularly look forward to the replacement when it came.

I feel bad for the server. I'm sure she wrote down \"vegan\" on the chit, and she comped the order afterwards. She seemed genuinely apologetic. I don't know who messed up, but someone ought to figure it out because this is a screw up that just isn't acceptable. I have literally never been to a restaurant that advertises itself as vegan and accidentally been served meat. And this is to say nothing of the potential harm for people with allergies.

I was looking forward to giving Disgraceland a great review. It was nice inside, and has a giant menu with lots of great sounding food. Unfortunately, I can't get over this sort of breach of trust. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This is now my favourite vegan restaurant in Toronto. My experience here was the best dining out experience in a while. The server was really friendly and helpful. The food was delicious and came out quickly. The atmosphere is super chill and they have a good selection of beer. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately every time I order something here its missing key ingredients... taco salad with wilted lettuce and no corn chips? At least there's cheap drinks."}
{"text":"I would have given 2 & a half if I could have.  Food is okay - they try too hard with the kindof creative menu ... you can get away with this if you have a great chef, but with an average one, why not just stick to the basics.  Brunches work best.  Bottom line, okay in a pinch but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Seriously, as a lapsed vegetarian, I love the food here.  Veggie corndogs, vegan mac and cheese, a grilled cheese sandwich with goat cheese--it's pub food heaven.  

But.  You are going to wait a long time for your food.  Like, a LONG time.  Long like you could probably play your way through an entire game of Monopoly (the short version) while you're waiting for your food.  Good thing this place has a stack of board games by the bar, hey?  

Or, actually, maybe you should use the wait to run out to the bank, because this place only takes cash and only has one of those shady no-name ATMs waiting to give you your money and charge you for the privilege.  No, really, you should go.  There's a CIBC at Ossington; you can make it."}
{"text":"I've been a faithful Disgraceland patron since they opened a few years ago. Holy crap the burgers were good - meaty, thick, juicy patties with fresh toppings. Even the fries were crisp and fresh. They weren't the best in the city, but definitely one of the hidden gems.

When I paid them a visit last night, I noticed the menu had changed. You don't get the pre-made burgers (Big Kahuna!!) but now every topping is an add-on, between $1-$3. So I say, what the hell, let me get a regular beef burger with jack.

Oh boy. Disappointed doesn't even start to describe what I was given. Frozen fries. Oversized boring bun. Dry beef patty. There was something resembling melted cheese in there, but could have been cheese wiz for all I care.

I have a feeling management changed in the past few months since I haven't been there, and with it the cooking staff, or they were now using cheaper ingredients.

Mind you, service was good as usual and the beer selection and prices are still the same. But since the burgers were the only thing that made me a regular there, I will never come back.

Definitely more Disgrace than Land."}
{"text":"I agree with one of the other reviewers, that Disgraceland is entirely hit or miss.  Sometimes i'll go and there will be great service, but more often than not, i'm there waiting and waiting... In fact, last time i went there, i ended up being there for a ridiculously long time.   The server was kind enough to let us know that the 'kitchen was really backed up' and thus the long wait time... but we waited even longer for our bill to come, and then even longer for the change for our bill to come (which never actually came).

The food is very good, i like that they have a lot of tasty vegan options (and i'm not even vegan). However the food is pricey!  Its about 10$ per brunch item, coffee/tea not included.  They even charge like 2-3$ extra if you order a couple slices of bread or a couple slices of bacon on the side.  Beer is expensive, but there is one cheap pitcher special.  The coffee is pretty good!

In summary, great food, but too expensive.  Unfortunately, I will likely return to this default restaurant until i find something else!"}
{"text":"WORST burger and Fries I've ever had
Had the Stardust - Fried egg and avo on (burnt) burger and (Burned) bread.  The fries tasted like they were fried at least 4 x (and I don't mind fries that have sat on the pass for 10 mins - I used to be a chef, I actually like my fries a bit soft, but still a bit of bite - OR Perfectly done)  These hard morsels disintegrated to almost saw dust after piercing through the hard exterior.  
My partner had the Turkey club, and enjoyed it - opt for a salad next time. 
The service was just OK, they took their sweet time.  
NEVER EVER will I return, there is a bright looking pub 2 doors over, go there."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times.  I love that they cater to Vegetarian/vegans, even though I'm not one myself. Always had a good time, their weekend brunch is especially good, and they have a pretty good beer selection.  Good times!"}
{"text":"this is a great place to go at night or for weekend brunch. as a vegan, i know i can get something edible without restricting everyone else's choices too much. and i know many meat eaters who enjoy the vegan poutine as much as me!

as far as brunch goes, it's not the best in the city, but they offer a few vegan choices. it's always nice to have choice! the side salad always has too much dressing on it (guess i could ask for no dressing ahead of time). the vegan full english is the most fun to order. 

9/10 times the server is nice, but when you get a bitchy one watch out! you will want to throw your drink at her (don't, it's not worth it. just leave a stingy tip, she probably won't work there anymore the next time you go.)

watch out for long weekends, they've been known to run out of any good beer on tap by the end of them, and will try to serve your beer in a water glass. 

verdict: total dive bar, vegan friendly, welcoming space. oh and there's a pool table and juke box."}
{"text":"I can't in good faith write an objective review here because Disgraceland is probably my favorite place in the neighborhood.  When I'm rallying the troops to go out on the town, we meet up there.  When we're recovering from our hangovers the next day, we hit up their delicious brunch (with fabulous brunch cocktails).  When I've had a bad day at work, I head over for a quiet grilled cheese.  When I had election-fever, the bar staff would generously hand over the remote control so I could eat at the bar and flip obsessively between Michelle Obama on Larry King and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC.  So yeah, it's like my very own personal Cheers.  With no Cliff Clavin.

The dinner menu is very reasonably priced, and they are not open for lunch so there is no lunch menu.  They offer up a twist on the usual pub fare with your traditional items (burgers, fries, salads) and your less usual items such as the grilled peanut butter and banana sandwich and the \"Chip Butty\" - a french fry sandwich optionally topped with worchestershire sauce and a fried egg.  Brunch is served on weekends through the late afternoon and the Veggie Benny and Heart Attack Benny (their special take on Eggs Benedict) is not to be missed.

The staff are all super nice and will often serve you a hot bowl of fresh popped popcorn when you walk in, or convince you to try a new drink they made up.  There are a lot of different DJ nights and other events which I've heard good things about, but since for me it's almost always either the first or last stop of the night, I can't say what those are like.  

Favorites: Grilled Cheeseland (many types of delicious cheeses and carmelized onions on multigrain bread), pulled pork sandwich, any of the brunch cocktails and any of the brunch offerings which involve either the orange chipotle hollandaise sauce or the fried tomato. 

Needs work: I've had friends complain that the brunch waitstaff could be friendlier, but since I'm usually there with a hangover I'm usually a raw bundle of nerves at the time myself. **Update: I had brunch there today and the service was lovely and friendly, although since it was busy it was a little on the slow side."}
{"text":"The vegan turkey club was unbelievable. They make their own fake turkey, which is juicy, chewy, and flavourful. It was an incredible sandwich, and my mouth still waters whenever I think about it.

The atmosphere was fun, and the service was fast and pleasant.

With so many amazing options, I know I'll be back the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"College style atmosphere which makes for a good hangout place. Everything can be made vegan.
But its like a college pub off campus.  It's like the cooks' taste buds never flourished into adulthood, this means that deep frying everything and putting sugar is \"good\" .

Like the chilli that I couldn't eat because it tasted like sweet tomato soup with chunks of veggies in it. I've been here a bunch of times since it opens and lately the food is just not enticing .Salads slapped together without care .poutine sauce poured over cold fries. Or maybe I've become a food snob and like tasty poutines and savory chillis. 

Don't get me wrong. They used to have deep fried cupcakes, tasty seitan blt and more flavor. Something is just not right at disgraceland."}
{"text":"A pretty great bar and the best part about it is the Cyborg  that DJs there on some nights. That guy played the rhythms that make my electronic heart short out. I really want to hear more!

The staff are friendly and the drink prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I quickly became obsessed with wanting to eat here based on the name and whispers of a delicious tofu scramble and got my chance this past Sunday. I came for brunch and had no trouble finding a seat right away. I of course ate the tofu scramble and it was excellent. It tasted sort of like soyrizo the way it was seasoned and came with tortilla chips. I wish there would have been more of them and those tasty potatoes I tried from someone else's plate instead of the salad greens that also came with the dish. It was a good, but not fatty enough for what I was feeling that day. Side note - the hot sauce on the table is HOT, like, it makes you want to die even if you just taste a little. 
The coffee was good and was refilled frequently as was the water. They also were playing really good music, which eventually turned to just Bowie, but that was fine by me. I was told that they have a night where anyone can be a dj and play their tunes for 20 minutes or something. That's pretty rad."}
{"text":"Not to be a total cliche but this place was disgraceful. When my friends and I went here they were only serving the brunch menu, but they gave us the dinner menu anyways. We wanted to order from the dinner menu and we asked how much longer until we could get it. She said they were going to stop serving in less then an hour. So we told our serve that it was fine and we would wait. So we order our food anyways. 

After an hour of waiting our server stopped coming to us and went to other tables that were already served by someone else. We felt like she was avoiding us. Another hour later,  a different server came to us to tell us is was going to be another hour before we would get our food.. We waited 2 HOURS!!! There were no more then 3 more people in this place. 

I'm never going here."}
{"text":"Terrible service and the food isn't any better.

We had a large party for a birthday.  It took 30 min to come take our first drink orders, then another 30 before they took our food orders. An hour later 3 of 12 people got their meals and then for 40 min we watched as our table would get one meal then another group would get fully served.  Then we'd get another two meals and see another table completely served.  About 2.5 hours after arriving I was the last to be served. I was able to take 3 bites of my burger that was burnt to a char on the outside and undercooked on the inside when we were confronted by multiple staff and told we had to leave our table because they were starting karaoke where we were just served dinner.  We were told we already stayed an hour longer than we should have, which made no sense because the only reason we were still there was their insanely terrible service. when a member of my group very politely asked for a manager  we were told by staff  \"what do we expect on a busy night?\" And \"its not our fault/problem you just got your food you have to get up right now\". They automatically charge 15% gratuity on groups larger than 6 so it was painfully obvious that the staff just didn't care. 

Im absolutely appalled by how their staff treated us and this has actually been THE worst restaurant experience I've had in over a decade..."}
{"text":"Brunch Review:

First time here, and not bad at all.  Service was *very* attentive, which was nice after having read all comments to the contrary.  Had the Eggs Benny w/ smoked salmon on fried green tomato slices, and it was quite tasty.  The hollandaise, however, was bland (none of this orange-chipotle concoction about which I had also read) and the coffee was as you'd expect: nothing special, but not terrible.  Music got waaaay too loud at one point but dropped down to a reasonable level soon after, and the selection was dandy.

I would certainly return to test it again, but fair warning: bring a flashlight to the bathroom.  Spoooooky.

**edited to add**

Have returned now twice for brunch, and despite this being nowhere near my 'hood, I'm happy to drop a solid gold TTC token to get there (it's conveniently crawling distance from the Delaware exit of Ossington station) now that I've had three good experiences.  It may make me a post-hipster tool, but having brunch to the soundtrack of the entire length of the Postal Service's \"Give It Up\" soothed my sentimental soul.  I'm a fan of the rotating brunch menu; I usually stick to a favorite, nary to venture away.  This forces me to try something new, even if it's only slightly different.  My \"salmon Monsieur\" with poached eggs (beautifully done, I might add) was terrific save for the toasted croissant being a tad cold, but that could be entirely my fault for starting with the salad, as I was raised to do. 

On another occasion, I was even tempted from a depression-induced lack of appetite to try a sweet offering (I'm much more the savory brunch type) which was french toast with Nutella and berries.  WIN.  I think it had been the first full meal I had eaten in weeks."}
{"text":"Need a vegan junky diner fix? Disgraceland is an okay place for this. I have to admit that we only ordered nachos and other vegan appetizers, so I have no idea what the entrees are like..  Next time, I'd skip the apps, and go for something a bit less lardy..

The atmosphere itself is fun. Tons of board games, friendly staff (ok there was only 1 waitress there), and friendly customers. No attitude here!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say something about the food. After waiting for an hour, we cancelled our food order and left the bar."}
{"text":"I frequent this place regularly (weekend, weekday / day, evening). Moderately priced, decent food, music that speaks to me. Only complaint is service can be beyond shoddy. Sometimes I get a get a server who's really on their a-game; attentive and sweet as pie. Other times that same server is deplorable. You can really never tell what you're walking into at disgraceland. But, if during your visit you can get someone to bring you drinks and/or food without having to jump through hoops, it's bound to be happy days"}
{"text":"The food and vibe of Disgraceland is awesome.  Try the tofu sandwich or the vegan poutine.  Not your traditional poutine by any means since there is no cheese on it but it's fries soaked in this wonderful and salty gravy with bits of tofu all over it.  The brunch is pretty good as well but they only pretty much have one vegan option which is the tofu scramble.  The coffee is terrible at best.  Service is pretty slow but it makes sense since there is never more than 2 people working there.  One of my favourite things about this joint is the plethora of board games they have for the customers to play with.  What's better than getting a few drinks with friends and playing a game of Trivial Persuit?"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night as we were looking for a restaurant with vegan options, but also meat for those who wanted.  Unfortunately after ordering, our meal took over 1 hour to be served. Add to this the fact that the appetizers we ordered were not served until the rest of our main course, the 2 burgers were burnt to a crisp, and the vegan chili cheese fries was served with real cheese. The worst experience I have ever had eating out in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks only. Their prices aren't great but it's spacious and has board games, and the laid back nerdy clientele that inevitably follows."}
{"text":"We went here after asking someone down the street where the best place to get a snack and a beer would be in this neighbourhood. And it didn't disappoint.

We sat at the bar but they have a range of different eclectic seating. Leah, the bartender was awesome. friendly, funny and fast. She also gave us some great tips on what to order. We tried the \"Popcorn Tofu\" It was crispy, deep friend and delicious without being too greasy. We also had the vegan tempura mushrooms and they were crispy tasty good too. We found that the gravy sauce that came with the tofu was equally good with the mushrooms and vice versa for the mushrooms soy sauce based dipping sauce. They had a great range of beers to wash it all down with. PS...I'm not even vegan (I am a meat loving carnivore!) and these things were awesome

I am definitely going to hit this place up again when I'm in town as there seemed to be some pretty cool other menu items worth trying. They had a grilled peanut butter, bacon and banana sandwich that I've quite curious about. Sounds weird but it must sell right?

Totally a great neighbourhood spot worth checking out!"}
{"text":"First off, food here is FANTASTIC.  Good menu and pretty much everything on it can be made vegan, so if you want to accommodate a friend and still enjoy your meat, this is the place.  Their burgers and sandwiches are delicious, and their rib dinner is a family favourite.  On the more expensive side of cheap downtown Toronto pubs, you get what you pay for - I've never walked away from here feeling anything other than full.  Drinks are fairly decent, they always have daily/weekly deals on pitchers of beers and ciders and you can't go wrong with that.

Okay, so now for the downside.  It says \"Pub\" on here, but it's basically a dive bar.  Yes, there are chairs and tables but no booths and it is LOUD.  Great if you just want to drink, not so great if you also wanna talk to your buds.  They have board games but I've never seen anyone play them because it's so loud it's not enjoyable and not the right atmosphere for them.  Best time to come here if you want the more pub feel and also be able to hear yourself talk is around 4-6pm, less people and the bar hopping hasn't started yet.  They also only accept cash, but they do have an ATM inside.  I really recommend this place, especially if all you want is cheap beer and vegan friendly pub food.  Come earlier if you wanna avoid the bar hopping crowds."}
{"text":"Okay so I will put a disclaimer on my review and say that I am Australian.  You could search high and low in Australia to get vegan pub food like this and be left wanting so it is a bit of a novelty for us.

I ended up at Disgraceland after giving up waiting 20 minutes in the cold to be seated at other vegan restaurant in the area and I was soo glad I walked the few minutes down the road.

This place is great! It is the perfect dive bar with the ultimate vegan comfort food.  People seemed cool, non pretentious and chilled.  It reminds me of my favourite bar back home. 

I was in heaven when our order of vegan poutine, vegan ribs dinner and Hank Hill vegan hotdog came out and the food coma after was well worth it.  

The service was a tad slow but after our previous wait I was content to drink my beer and allow my limbs to de-thaw before our food came out.

I know when I move into the area next week this will become a frequent haunt."}
{"text":"Le personnel de cuisine comme en salle vous donnera l'impression d'être dans un monde assez particulier : tatoués, jeunes, déclassés. Ils sont en fait attachants et sympathiques. Comment ne pas aimer un restaurant qui vous propose un plat intitulé 'la crise cardiaque' ? Encore un endroit qu'il faut fréquenter le dimanche matin après une soirée bien arrosée !"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Great to be able to go to a real bar setting and having a ton of vegan options to choose from! The staff is also so friendly. Loyal customer right here!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review on my phone from the bathroom here (which is freezing cold by the way). I am wearing a pink J Crew oxford shirt (sleeves rolled partly up my forearms), rubber duck boots, and leggings as pants. 

I came here with my BFF (best friend forever) and we're both on krokodil so this review might not make a huge amount of sense, apologies in advance. They have a good selection of beers on tap and on the black board, nothing noteworthy or really daring. I ordered the perogies, which I think are still frozen or maybe they're stale (do perogies go stale?) because I can pick them up and dip them in the FOR SURE frozen sour cream. So maybe don't order those. I don't know about the other food but I'm not too interested in checking it out. 

Our waitress was pretty nice and friendly although I think she dislikes me because of all my casual references to \"my car\" and \"my driver\" and \"my clean clothes.\" She could sense that my friend was cooler than me. 

Ultimately it's a nice place and I like the darkness and the vibe but make sure you sit away from the door in the winter because whenever it opens you'll get a cold draft. Unless you're on a bad acid trip and need to cool down (who still does that???). 

God bless."}
{"text":"So unimpressed. Extremely long wait times & rude servers (kept us waiting and waiting, told us it would just be \"a bit longer\" when it wasn't busy, avoided eye contact when we tried to make it). Didn't even get a chance to order food- we waited almost two hours for it, so we walked out. (I was in a party of four.) Appropriate name for the place, though..."}
{"text":"The Cuban Sandwich was very yummy. 
Great atmosphere to hangout with friends. The service was a little slow when I went, but it was pretty busy and can't blame them when there were only two servers working. 
Overall, good experience :)"}
{"text":"Went for Sat brunch. The server let us come in and grab a table early. She even gave us some coffee while she finished opening up. We had our 10mo daughter with us and they made up a special plate of fruit just for her. The food was good, portions were just right. Only complaints are that it was frickin cold in there and they don't have a high-chair."}
{"text":"DISGRACELAND, \"a divey, unfriendly, poorly tended to spot for all the surrounding idiots that don't know what good food is\", I think that must be what the boss intended on opening, and if not, then unfortunately that is what it has become! The food here is absolutely DISGUSTING. I got deep-fried pickles as an appetizer, the breading was falling off and the pickles were without a doubt rotting or extremely old. My Mom took one bite of a pickle and wouldn't eat anymore, if it weren't for my RIDICULOUS love of pickles I think I may have gotten up and excused myself from the restaurant with my Mother right there, but the pickles kept me. Our waitress was undeniably rude and uninterested in her job, looking around while speaking to us, speaking quietly, no manners, no explanations, no recommendations, nothing came out of their servers. They didn't have any beef or chicken whatsoever, so almost all of their meat-containing dishes weren't even available. I ordered a vegan sloppy-joe, described to be a kaiser bun filled with tofu mixed with a tomato sauce and grilled vegetables. It looked like my kaiser bun was killed with baby feces. It was chunky, wet, dripping, disgusting tomato sauce with chunks of tofu throughout. No grilled vegetables, the freakin' kaiser bun was soggy, the tofu mix was barely warm, this meal was absolutely unheard of, I felt taken advantage of having to pay for that.
PLEASE, unless you are STRICTLY drinking alcohol, do not go to Disgraceland. Great for a bar, DISGUSTING for any food consumption."}
{"text":"Im totally not one to complain about waiting times (I worked in a kitchen) but oh my god... it took me an hour and 20 minutes to get eggs benedict. I was watching the kitchen staff chat, play pool and pick their ass while I waited and waited. There were 2 other tables in the whole restaurant.

The serving staff is the only good thing about this place. I would totally suggest this place for a hang out/drinks, but their food and kitchen staff are ruining it."}
{"text":"Smelled like cat litter in the bar, wtf. Ordered nachos -- $15 for cold, somewhat uncooked nachos. How does one screw up nachos? Try. Harder."}
{"text":"There's something to be said about a solid dive bar. No pretenses, just grab a seat anywhere and chow down/chug drinks. Disgraceland is a dive bar that is comfortable over grungy, and has pretty decent service over having ambivalent hipsters ignore you (although sometimes it can be a little slow). It's great! In the warmer months they open up their full length front windows onto the street, but i'm sure come snowfall it'll be cozy inside with your friends and a drink.

There's a pretty standard fare as far as drinks go here - but they do have a non-Strongbow option for cider, which I am thankful for! (Sir Perry.) They have beer specials also, and dead cheap pitchers of sangria for sharing with chums. 

Food-wise they have a terrific kind of diner/bar hybrid menu (and they serve til 2am!). Apps, salads, sammiches, burgers, hotdogs - and every single section has vegetarian and vegan options. You are a winner, Disgraceland! Their veg-dogs are so awesome, and are available with a seemingly endless range of toppings. The mac'n'not-cheese vegan app is a definite win too - comfort foodsville, hell yeah. I'm looking forward to getting back and trying their vegan ribs (what what!) and more hot dog options. Maybe even brunch (!).

So grab a booth and settle in - you can make a disgrace out of yourself or not, but with a laid-back atmosphere, good eats & decent drinks, it's hard to go wrong with an evening at Disgraceland."}
{"text":"I've put off reviewing Disgraceland for a while, because I couldn't settle on an appropriate amount of stars. My problem, essentially, is that I have very few standards. If a place has good music and decent beer, I'm usually pretty content (incidentally, this is why I spend so much time at home, where I can provide myself a surplus of both of those things). I become blind to any downside.

And Disgraceland really nails the music and the beer, which makes me want to slap 5 stars on it and call it a day. I also recognize, however, that it's not without its flaws, and I'd hate to sacrifice my integrity as a Yelp reviewer and overlook them entirely. So:

-- The brunch. I've ordered three or four different things off the brunch menu and haven't ever really left thinking \"Wow, that was great.\" Usually it's \"Eh, that was okay.\" I think there are better options in the area.
-- The service. Sometimes very good. Sometimes spotty. During one brunch visit, I sat for an hour at a table that hadn't been wiped clean after the last group left. If it weren't for my aforementioned lack of standards, I DEFINITELY would've been turned off by this. Nonetheless, objectively I recognize the problem here.
-- The beer selection. Not 100% sure, but it seems like on some nights there are fewer beers on tap. The last time I went there were only three -- 50, PBR, and a third that I don't recall. Would be nice to have a few more options consistently (for others' sake, I mean -- all I need is 50).

When it comes down to it though, Disgraceland's flaws aren't enough to ruin the fact that I LOVE IT THERE. Great vibe, great music, affordable drinks, and appropriate volume/lighting levels (this should be easy but so many bars inexplicably get it wrong). Also: the hot dog with brie and pears on it is amazing. I don't care what any of my friends say."}
{"text":"Knocked off a point, as a few of my subsequent visits haven't been as great.  It is pretty inconsistent in the wait for service and the quality of the food.  One visit, it is great, and the next, it is less than stellar.  

It is still a good go-to place for cheap beers & sangria with munchies that omnivores & veggies/vegans can enjoy.  Take it for what it is.

The onion rings are always a good bet."}
{"text":"This place is always hit or miss for me. If you're looking for vegan eats and a dive bar atmosphere you've found your place."}
{"text":"Hello.
I was here yesterday with my girlfriend. We ran out of things to talk about so we figured we could use a change of scenery. She got a quesadilla that may have been vegan. We wanted to inquire with the server as to whether everything was vegan, but she wasn't having any of it. I got the butter \"chicken\" wrap. The quotations would indicate that that something might be wrong with the chicken. Think you're going to pull a fast one on me? No frickin' way! Try again, D-land. The butter \"chicken\" wrap was fun, I felt adventurous. My girlfriend wouldn't try it. Why not? Live a little, this is why we left the house in the first place. Anyway, I hope you're doing well, it was good seeing you."}
{"text":"Dark atmosphere, cool music, considerate service, khaula burger was delicious + the coleslaw on the side!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here well over 2 years and love the vegan-friendly fare!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the Ossington neighbourhood.

I've had the eggs benny, the veggie eggs benny, and the bacon+peanut-butter french toast. all are delicious. 

I wish they had more local(ish) beer. If I recall correctly, they have (on tap), Labatt 50, Pabst, and something called \"two armed stout\" or something like that. Where's the Creemore? Where's the Mill Street?

They have board games you can grab from the bar, and because the place is full of 21st century hipsters, you won't feel self-conscious playing \"Sorry!\" or whatever, because they will all think it's ironic."}
{"text":"I only came here for the first time recently. The Vegan cuban sandwich is AMAZING! But only get it if you can handle hot-spicy horseraddish (seriously, very strong). But it's delicious! The music was great (90s stuff) and it was karaoke night which was a lot of fun. 

The big problem I have with this place is the appetizer was SO SMALL!!!! And not cheap, either. :( 

I wish I could give 3 and 1/2 stars. I'll give 4 because they can make most things on the menu vegan."}
{"text":"It doesn't appear so from the outside but this place is the best for vegan comfort food! I was so pleasantly surprised at the variety of options on the menu for myself!
I had a vegan burger topped with onion rings and vegan pulled \"pork\". I was completely blown away. Even when I ate meat, I've never had pulled pork as good as here!
The lighting is very dark and purple which doesn't make the food look super great (don't expect a good food pic it hour flash) but the taste makes up for it.
Regrettably this place is cash only which is a major disappointment although not the worst thing in the world. 
The other thing is the prices aren't outstanding. It was $2 to add to onion rings to my burger. They were great but that price isn't worth it and I wouldn't do it again. 
The service was alright. Our server came around frequently but didn't seem to be in a very good mood.
But I want to die by drowning in that vegan pulled pork. It is everything."}
{"text":"man, I love this place!
like real big love!

so you get inside and it's dark and looks just like a regular pub kinda place. but then you look into their menu and at their decorations and the regular pub idea erases from your head.

almost EVERYTHING on the menu can be or is veganized! aaaaaaaamazing! vegan mach& cheese, vegan turkey breast sandwich, vegan cheesestake and SO MUCH MORE!

I had vegan cheesestake and it was pretty yummy. also to be noted - sides variety is vast! you can choose anything from fries to coleslaw and potato salad (the latter is very good!)

the prices on the menu already include taxes (YES!) and they easily bring separate bills. there is also a full bar and a bookshelf with boardgames. 
also table soccer=) and plush toys over the bar... in cages.

LOVE IT=) you should try it too!"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend after work for a couple of pints... and a snack.... it was not that busy (it was also a bit early) the first order was taken quickly and our drinks served immediately. After that things changed the waitress did not notice our empty glasses.... she had her head down most of the time behind the bar ....I had to approach her twice for service...... I  should not have to get up and walk to the bar to ask for drink. Nothing special ... not so great service."}
{"text":"Giving two stars because I didn't get food poisoning. But the food was awful. Both times I went. Don't understand how basic pub grub can be made so poorly. Service was also awful. No smiles or asking if we needed anything or how our meals were. Major bummer because it's definitely got the look and menu of a great place but the staff and actual taste are really bad. If you hate serving, get another gig. If you can't cook, get outta the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu can be veganised upon request at no extra cost. I ordered the classic burger with a side of coleslaw. The burger was alright but the coleslaw was meh. Prices are reasonable. Service is OK. Overall not bad but if you are looking for a vegan bar then I suggest that you head to hogtown instead."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews, seems like I really need to visit this place more often. 

I came here once for brunch after reading that it one of the best Eggs Bennys ('heart attack benny') in Blogto. it was 10:30am and the place seemed kind of a dive. We were the only ones there, but the atmosphere picked up after more people trailed in around 11:30. 
The food was GOOD, and probably could have given me a heart attack. 

Today we came here after an awesome dinner at Nazareth, for some drinks and dessert. 
LOVE the smores (mini sammiches with 'fluff' and nutella and vanilla ice cream to dip) and fried Mars Bars. 
The desserts were $5 (prices include taxes, how awesome, +1 star). 

Now to go back and try this Grilled Cheese."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday with family at Disgraceland after reading the reviews. The restaurant is quite dark inside with menus very hard to read and to see the food. Has nice arts by locals in the walls and has multiple TVs, quite a few board games and a snooker table. 

The washroom is a floor down as with many restaurants downtown. The rest rooms need some work. 

The food ordered a small nachos which was good. Also ordered Popcorn Tofu and Soy Drumstix. There were 3 drumstix and were bit dry but the Jack Daniels sauce was good. Popcorn tofu was deep fried with a nice crunch, but he coating lacked flavour and the gravy as well

We ordered a Chik'n Parm Sandwich which was good and cheesy. A Lumber Jacques with Veggie burger which was delicious with the mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes were creamy and with skin just the way I like it but needed some flavour as well

Also had a Poutini Weenie with a veggie dog with poutine with hot dog. Quite good actually. Vegan Rib dinner was the best and Vegan Bangers and Mash. The vegan Italian sausage was good. The mash and gravy needs some serous flavouring. It was bland for our taste. We weren't looking for spicy versions but some flavours. 

The kids finished off with Deep Fried Mars bars. There are three in a order ( Halloween size Mars) with a nice soft and chewy inside and a delicious coat. The chocolate sauce with it was a nice touch. 

It is actually three and a half star with one star deducted for less flavourful mash and gravy and also  Parm. 

The service was fantastic. The chef / owner did come out as well as the food took longer to come. But that did not bother us at all. And the fact he came and spoke to us said a lot to us. We went towards the end of brunch hour and they served us from the dinner menu is appreciated"}
{"text":"Disgraceland was one of the 6 options on the 'Passport to Poutine' and had it not been for that, I probably would not have trekked all the way here. Unfortunately, I probably won't be making that trek again.

We arrived as Saturday brunch was coming to an end and dinner service was beginning, and were told seating was a free-for-all. After about 15 minutes, we were able to claim a table. After another 10 minutes of not being acknowledged, we went up to get a menu ourselves, followed by another 10-15 minutes of trying to get some service and place our orders. I don't know what was up with service; there was one point where one of the servers had to run to the bank to get cash!

The Passport to Poutine allowed us to sample their Indian Poutine, described as an \"Indian-flavored poutine featuring a vegan gravy made from grainy mustard, red wine, and curry paste.\" The poutine wasn't really a poutine; a bowl of fries with maybe two tablespoons of the gravy and very little cheese curds. My friend and I both had to add ketchup to salvage it. I also ordered the Tofu Popcorn, described as \"KFC-style tofu\" and ended up lacking batter, with the gravy tasting like smoke and coffee grinds.

The only redeeming factor of this place are the board games, but even that's not saying much!"}
{"text":"To be fair, this is a BRUNCH REVIEW ONLY.

I'm a patient person most of the time.  But my oh my, Disgraceland, today you tested me.  Your coffee delivers a mouthful of grains, your dishes are undercooked and overpriced, your service is painfully slow, and in this girl's eyes, there's nothing redeeming about your brunch.  Hipster hangout be damned.

I'll give you a star for having board games on hand, though."}
{"text":"While living temporarily in the West End, we visited Disgraceland one night for dinner. 

I commend their accessible menu, diverse with carnivore, vegetarian and vegan options. Their hot dogs and hamburgers offer really creative toppings (like kim chi) and they have really decadent poutines (like a poutine but with perogies on top, in case your heart was still pumping after the curds and gravy), gourmet grilled cheese and really interesting appetizers. 

I think I ate my weight in various dishes that night. The caveat is that I won't be going back, because the waitress responsible for our table of 4 adults and one baby, where the bill topped $120, was rude, dismissive and obviously lacking passion for her work. 

Too bad, because I could definitely see myself going back otherwise."}
{"text":"I loved the name. 

I absolutely want to use the word \"disgraceland\" for something. I'm surprised there is not a tv show; a country; or a metaphor using that description....

I'm just so glad we were bar hopping one day on Bloor St and we found this alternative, kind of underground spot (no one gives a f... about who is there, wearing what and speaking about who...). Yes, I like different stuff/patterns/places/ and disgraceland gave me a rocker/punk/whatever vibe well deserved after suffering too much pretensions, restrictions, standards, exclusions, and every concept that implies segregation.

We had a beer and some huge amazing onion rings. I saw a happily crowded place with good service, and a constant flow of heterogeneous individuals coming and going.

I can't remember anything else. But if I do, I'll write it..."}
{"text":"I've always avoided this place because the name put me off and I imagined it was filthy and had rats. My friend made me come here because they have a vegan dessert. It wasn't as dirty as I'd imagined, quite clean, actually. The server's attitude was pretty dirty, though. The entire time we were there we had to listen to her complain to any customer who would listen about how she wished she had someone to help her and how overworked she was. Apparently she was working alone? Maybe someone called in sick? Anyway, she needs to know that customers aren't paying to hear about her problems. If you're backed up, smile, apologize for the delay, and just serve the damn food. 

Anyway, we got a vegan dessert, some kind of cookies with fake whipped cream and a couple raspberries for six bucks and a non-vegan deep fried mars bar which was three smalls chunks of mars bar wrapped in soggy batter with whipped topping from a can for five bucks. I like mars bars but apparently when you fry them they just become sweet goo and loose all their deliciousness. The dish was also fried at too low of a temperature. The batter was greasy and heavy with oil. It was edible but I wouldn't buy it again.

We figured we might as well have a little booze. It was like five in the afternoon, though, so we asked for half-pints, they don't do those. Boo. I don't think I'd go back based pretty much on service alone. 

As a side note, on the way out heading back to Ossington there was a huge dead rat sprawled out on the side walk a couple buildings down. If it weren't so gross I might have chuckled."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, decent beer selection and ok food. I found the music here to loud for a bar where people come to chat. Average good local place..."}
{"text":"Would be a cool dive/hipster bar anyway, but the fact that they have so many vegan options makes it outstanding! The vegan poutine was amazing - they use tofu instead of Daiya to make it awesomely authentic. The bartender was super-friendly, which is often hard to find in a place so trendy."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely the worse. I waited 10 minutes without a single staff member approaching me. When I tried to grab the attention of a waiter, I was ignored.

If you like staff who are completely ignorant, go here."}
{"text":"I love going here during the week, it's not tooooo busy, the servers are nice enough, drinks are cheapish, and the food is good for meat eaters and non-meat eaters alike! I love their poutine and they just came out with some new menu items that look good.  It doesn't try to be healthy like other places that serve vegan/vegetarian food which I appreciate, and is also very reasonably priced (unlike another vegan place just down the street...). My go to is the tempeh blt. My partner eats meat but he loves their vegan pulled pork (made from seitan with the same pulled pork sauces)."}
{"text":"all the food is vegan, even though the menu isn't super clear about it! so just to be clear: there is no meat, everything (yes even the burgers and ribs) are vegan. Apparently they don't really advertise this because people wouldn't order the food if they knew it was vegan. Doesn't seem like a great plan but i guess that's what they're after.

The onion rings were good. The 'rib' sauce was good. The burger was forgettable. The fries were not cooked all the way through.

Cash only."}
{"text":"The crowd is completely different every time I come in here... 

One Thursday night a barful of ten odd strangers turned into an appropriately disgraceful display of debauchery and cameraderie.

Couple weeks later we stumbled in here late night to dust my Ms Pacman virginity, when I was asked by the bartender to \"do me a favour and stop screaming?\" Looking around, I realized there weren't many people in the bar and they were all being pretty quiet, which I guess made my small yelps of enthusiasm unwelcome. Still, I wasn't that loud and she didn't have to be that rude. Rather than suppress my Ms Pacman gusto, we decided to switch to Battleship, a game that I am able to enjoy with contained passion. 

Following weekend we walk into a room comandeered by metal/hardcore kids, most of whom seem to know eachother and are bopping their heads casually to passionate screams and electric riffs. 

Just bring yourself, and Disgraceland will provide pool, a broken pinball machine (TIP: if you fidget enough, you can find a way to play for free!) board games, and an always surprising soundtrack and cast. Based on the good reviews I'm going to have to return to try the munchies!"}
{"text":"I brought my vegan friend to Disgraceland.  She is very, very cool and had not been, so I was excited to show it to her.  Disgraceland's menu had changed a tiny bit since I had been there.  The deep fried cupcakes were no longer on the menu, and the drink list was being updated.

I forgot to mention in my last review of Disgraceland that the bathrooms are not accessible and the bathrooms are gendered.  

I ordered a Pimm's cup and split an order of nacho's with my friend.  I had previously had the nachos at Disgraceland, but the non-vegan version. They were okay.  The vegan version was MUCH better.  I think they use daiya cheese.  My only complaint would be the salsa on the chips was not spicy enough.  However, that's probably why they're served with a bottle of hot sauce.  Oh, and the Pimm's Cup, for those of you who don't watch Archer/Boardwalk Empire is a mixed a drink and darn it was good!  I will definitley be ordered off the vegan menu next time I come!"}
{"text":"What a great discovery! This adult cafe is opened in the afternoons and serves brunch on the weekends and adult beverages to go along. They also boast a pool table and a pinball machine in the back room. The board games are accessible. By this I mean, they are not as intimidating as the ones offered in Snakes & Lagers. 

I came here on a Saturday afternoon for a meetup group and had a lot of fun. The guy working the bar in the early afternoon was sweet and helpful in my drink selection."}
{"text":"Came to Disgraceland on a Saturday night with 3 friends. They had a special going on - $5 for pints of Amsterdam Blonde. The food was also affordable, I got the taco bowls ($10 including a side of fries) which was filling. My friends got a poutine ($9) and the special which was a BLT ($8 no side) -- everyone liked the food. 

The service was really friendly. The inside is dimly lit with a dive bar atmosphere and good music. There's some awesome art on the way to the bathrooms -- so awesome that I totally walked into the open men's room after missing the sign for the ladies room. Also heads up it's cash only.

Definitely try this out if you like dive bars and want affordable eats and drinks."}
{"text":"I love this place. The fact that it offers a variety for meat lovers and vegans is fantastic for my friends. The beer selection is good and the staff are wicked awesome."}
{"text":"The food is just 2-3 stars.  The service and beer selection are better @ 4-stars.  Prices are low and the place looked/felt mostly fine -- but make sure to hold your breath when passing by the stairs that descend to the restrooms.  The overall rating feels somewhere between a 3 and 4 star.  I'd willingly go back again."}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER GO HERE FOR BRUNCH AGAIN. We have gone here a few times for brunch (it's just down the street from where we live). After our last experience I will never go back, neither will the 2 people I was with and the table of 4 next to us. The service sucked, the food SUCKED! and when we told one of the servers she didn't care. 
ugh."}
{"text":"Heard lots of great things about this restaurant and finally decided to check it out.  The interior is interesting, but something seemed off about it.  There were only a handful of tables next to the windows that receive natural light, the further you go into the venue, the darker it gets.  The music was a tad bit loud for me.  

Everything on the menu looked fantastic!  And 99.9% of the menu could be made vegan!  We had the nachos, which was fantastic!  Also had Italian sausage and turkey, the latter wasn't as good as I expected it to be, the sausage was slightly better.  The staff was very friendly!

Note: they do not accept cards, cash only.  There is an ATM machine on site."}
{"text":"I love the food, the music and the vibe, but are all the servers drugged before their shifts?  Why are they the most lifeless and odd individuals?  It often takes them forever to take a drink order and if you're lucky they won't screw up your food order.  You could be the only table at the bar and the server will be sitting at the bar folding napkins for 15 minutes before even looking at you.  And when the bar is full, there might be only one server working, so yes, they are slow and also understaffed.  Everyone likes a dive bar but no one likes an inept server.  Seriously, someone tell the owner to hire some kids with common sense and at least a slight personality.  

Besides that, their menu is awesome.  Brunch is delicious but extremely slow.  You won't mind so long as you have good company.   Overall, it takes forever to get your food and it's pretty inconsistent.  Every time I order the fried tofu sandwich it tastes totally different, which can be annoying or a total delight.  Sometimes their food is way too salty.  

Ok, so really, this place needs a lot of work, but it's a great bar to get food late at night.  

I chalk all its problems up to the fact that it's relatively new.  I think in time it'll be one of the greatest bars in the city and you'll never be able to get a table."}
{"text":"Our group went for a late lunch here on a Sunday.

The atmosphere was nice however we experienced a few major issues. 

Four of us in our group ordered meat burgers. All burgers were extremely burnt. For $14  for a burger there is a certain degree of quality you would expect which was not provided.  

Drink orders were forgotten and sides were mixed up. The wait time was also long for a fairly simple order. 

We were in a rush so we ate what was provided but the quality was unacceptable. Surprising that they would even serve food of that quality. Wouldn't come here for food again."}
{"text":"Key Features: Cheap Beer $5.00 domestic pints, $7.00 premium pints, and a rack of Board Games.

Keep in mind that \"3 Stars\" means it was good, and \"2 Stars\" means, \"Meh... I've experienced better...\"  I use a full range of the star system.  Two stars does not mean it's terrible.  It doesn't even mean I won't go back (I probably will.)  But it wasn't without its problems.

I walked in, and grabbed a seat by the window, all dressed up with Christmas lights, which I assume are there full year.  I was waiting for a friend, and had nothing to read.  Looking around for a Now Magazine, or something of that nature, I saw a rack of board games in the corner.  Unlike Snakes and Lattes, there's no need to pay $5.00 to use these game, you can just go over and help yourself.  I grabbed Trivial Pursuit and was quickly amazed by how little I knew about 1990s popculture (save for What Animated Television show began with a tribute to Yak Shaving? A: Ren and Stimpy.)

When attempting to order our beer, I quickly learned that two kegs were empty, and another few were frozen.  Our beer choices were cut in half.  Now, I know it was cold (windchill -30) but I'm of the mind that lines should not freeze.  I'm also of the mind that when you ask what's on tap, and you're pointed at the beer menu, none of them should be out - because, after all, that's why you asked what was on tap - to see what you could order.

But never mind that, I had good conversation, and good beer, and all was right and well in the world.  Our waitress was fairly charming too.  I had just two issues - which is what pushed this from a 3 star review to a 2 star review.

Our waitress asked my friend if he wanted another pint.  He did.  She then asked me, and I said - not yet, but in the future I would want one.  I still had a quarter of my pint left.

When she returned with his, she brought me a second one as well.  Now, what if I was just being polite saying i'd probably want one in the future?  What if I had no desire for that pint?  Luckily I did - but it was a bold, and audacious decision, on her part.

So, after my beer had been sitting for some time, I finished my first pint, and looked to the second.  Luckily, as it was cold enough to freeze the lines, my beer was not warm - but were this summer, and the same thing occurred, it would have been an issue.  

The second issue was when she cleared the beer.  I had my last gulp left in the pint glass, waiting for my buddy to reach the end of his.  But, I was denied the opportunity to finish our pints together, because in that moment - the waitress came and took my beer away.  There were probably 50ml left in the glass, which is no small amount.  

She did not ask if she could take it away - she just camp and swept it up.  There was no time to call it back.

This...  this was not ideal.  I'm of the mind that if a plate isn't completely empty, don't touch it without asking, and if a glass isn't totally gone, keep your hands away from it.  Period.  If someone orders another drink, fine, take the previous.  If they've left their booth - take it.  But, if they're still sitting, and their drink isn't done, just walk away.

P.S. Street Parking was Ample"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it had a great, lively atmosphere. The Vegan pulled pork I ordered was delicious! Overall, one of my favourite places to go with friends both vegan and non-vegan! It's hard to find places that can please both carnivorous and vegan lifestyles and this place is great. Only negative was the seating was uncomfortable and every time the front door opened we got a cold breeze."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a dive/hipster bar/restaurant with tons of vegan options. Sure..why not!  It has a very dark grimy feel to it; but I suppose that is part of it's charm. Also it appears they have revamped the menu since the last time I was there over a year ago.

Cash only folks! (as if these places still exist!) I'll probably pay in pennies next time I go."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd picture from the menu, a greasy spoon that offers a ton of vegan options. Pretty good for brunch but the food is pretty bland and the service is pretty hit or miss. A good spot if you're looking for vegan comfort food but just meh for everything else. They play decent music."}
{"text":"Snarky server that was super disinterested and wouldn't look at us when we were ordering set the tone for my most recent visit. Sorry for being a bother, I guess. 

Food wise, this is nothing like it was when I made my first review. I've eaten here three times recently and each time everything was a missed opportunity. Ribwhich, bangers and mash, shroomie doom dooms, popcorn tofu, butter chicken burrito, Coleslaw, rib dinner; all lacking flavour, all remarkably tasteless.

Sad times. Food so bland I felt the need to update my review."}
{"text":"Night time review: Fun experience if you're the type of drunk whose attention span lasts longer than five seconds. Unfortunately, I am not. Playing team Battleship I was often staring forlornly at an empty space on the floor upon which I might be able to dance. Due to this, my team failed miserably at sinking ships. 

They may have purchased some new board games within the past six months, but last time I checked, there were quite the number of missing objects from each box, making the games somewhat challenging to complete...

HOWEVER. The desserts were bomb. They don't come in large portions, but it was here that I first tried a deep-fried Mars bar. *Insert angelic music to contribute to the level of deliciousness experienced*
I also believe that they had S'mores. Or some sort of S'more concoction. Which was equally as scrumptious. Good eats for a student bar!"}
{"text":"I tried out Disgraceland based on Kat F.'s list of \"best grilled cheeses\", seeing as Grilled Cheese rivals Cheeseburger for me in my \"what would you choose as your last meal\". 
SO. I head out to Disgraceland with high expectations for this sandwich, and BOY did they hold up! It was awesome!! Highly recommended. My friend had the Trash can platter (we were there for brunch) and he said it was also incredible.
If there was anything to complain about, it was the drinks...I've never had a Long Island Iced Tea before and that's what my friend and I ordered. Seeing as I've never had one it was fine to me, but my friend said that it was nowhere NEAR a LIIT and that this one didn't count. The waitress/bartender tried her best though. Service was a LITTLE slow but the girl was working the place alone and it was semi-busy.
I loved the decor and atmosphere as well. Anywhere with a wicked selection of CD's in the jukebox has my vote. Although we didn't play, I also think having the board games in there just made me feel even more at home. 
Last but not least...dessert. I had the deep fried twinkies (b/c really...when something that awesome is on a menu, how can you NOT have it?) and they were HEAVENLY. 3 for $5 isn't bad either, and they come with ice cream. I'd never had anything like it before. SO GOOD!!! If not for Yelp, I'd have no idea this place existed!! So thanks Yelp (and Kat!!)!"}
{"text":"I have since come back to try their grilled cheese sandwiches, which were recommended to me by the internet. I also decided to give them another chance for dinner, since brunch was so disappointing. The sandwich was not bad, very greasy but it's a grilled cheese, I guess I have no complaints. I wouldn't say it was amazing or outstanding. I have had better in Toronto and outside of the city. So I guess my recommendation would be to go there for dinner and not brunch, but that's your personal choice!"}
{"text":"Contrary to popular belief, no this is NOT where Elvis spent his last days before Od'ing on deep fried PB& banana sandwiches and quaaludes, no indeed.
Disgraceland offers all the hallmarks of a bonafide hipster dive bar/pub complete with ubiquitous tattooed sleeves, puerile bearded lads, and of course Pabst Blue Ribbon on tap.

My whole reason for coming was for the extensive Vegan menu items as I'm on a quest for  yummy vegan fare, not to mention the menu is hilariously sorted by titles like \"Appyland\"  \"Fryland\" and \"Doggy-Style\" which definitely piqued hubby's interest :D  

 The Shroomy Doom Dooms (tempura'd shrooms)  are excellent, and the tempura batter was crisper here than any decent Japanese resto could fry up.  My unturkey club with surprisingly savoury \"facon\" tempeh and vegan macaroni salad hit the spot on a cold night and hubby demolished his Pulled Pork with JD BBQ sauce Sandwich+ Coleslaw with gusto much to our servers delight.

Although previous reviews complained of lackluster service I think it's just REALLY laid back at Disgraceland, but not slow or anything like that as our food came pretty quick, it's just informal.  As far as I could tell servers were super nice and friendly and I swear hubby was crushing a bit on them and mistaking their amiable service for flirtation (stupid middle aged men!)

All-in-all I liked Disgraceland and wouldn't mind popping by again for some casual vegan eats.  It's an excellent choice where both vegans and carnivores can (hopefully) peacefully dine together.  Also, thumbs-up for playing 90's Brit-pop...yay Pulp!  3.75"}
{"text":"This place is just OK. I've been for dinner a few times now with the girls. 

It's a dive bar but it's not as \"dive-y\" or dingy as some other places.

The service has been slow, really slow, both times. Tonight it took a long time for the food to come out, then one of my friends ordered dessert which took over 20 minutes to appear. Then like 15 minutes to get change for the bill. Not cool.

The menu is certainly unique, they have a whole section of hotdogs/corndogs that come with really unique condiment options (\"Surrender Monkey\" comes with brie and pear). I also love the appetizer called \"Shroomy Doom Doom\" (tempura mushrooms). Not that they are particularly good, but \"Shroomy Doom Doom\" just sounds so cool!

The food is really just adequate. I've tried the pulled pork sandwich and the grilled peanut butter and banana. Neither were as greasy as I expected - from all the previous Yelp reviews I was expecting major grease. 

They do some unique drink options too, \"bourbon vanilla milkshakes\" are $9. 

Think I will pass on future dinners here, but it's decent in a pinch."}
{"text":"We got the Poutine Passport from Joylister and this was our first stop. On offer was the Indian Poutine. Fries and cheese curds covered a mustard seed studded curry gravy and topped with green onions. The curry sauce was very salty, and though it was delicious the salt left me feeling a little sick after. The portion was quite small consider how inexpensive fries are in general. No squeak in the cheese curds, sad. Overall the poutine was fine.

The man also got the Vegetable Quesadilla. Which was fine, cheese, black beans, cucumber, peppers and seitan smothered in two types of cheese and served with salsa. Nothing special in my opinion.

We also got some drinks. He got the Oatmeal Stout and I got a Vanilla Bourbon Sour. Holy over pour for me, but had the necessary sweetness to cut through the salt from the poutine. The cracked pepper was intriguing as an ingredient, but didn't add anything to the drink.

Service was fine considering only one person was manning the entire restaurant and bar. If I knew more vegan or vegetarian folks I'd come back here again, but as an omnivore I have no reason to return."}
{"text":"I had long been enticed by: 
1. its location (anything near Dovercourt might as well be home)
2. its name...I went to Graceland once, you know. It was far from a disgrace, FYI.

We finally went for the first time, and went a little late to expect a real brunch, and they were indeed out of eggs Benedict (\"Benny\") as well as hash browns. I had me some blueberry pancakes that were, as my sister called them, \"dense\". I think this is a good thing, but it is also this quality that leaves me unable to have more than, say, 3. Which was conveniently the number on my plate!
They said the syrup was \"espresso-infused\" but I couldn't taste it. All-around yummy, though.

I liked: the very nice and accommodating waitress and the jug of water at our table that allowed constant hydration and the PLAYLIST! I dug it so much that I had to remember that it wasn't my iPod playing on shuffle. Next time, I hope they will let me order the mac 'n cheese, cuz I hear it's good. ;-)"}
{"text":"On my self-inflicted journey to becoming diabetic by age 30, Disgraceland has ensured my dreams will not crash and burn!

This dive bar's menu reads like something from Half Baked:
- Mac & Cheese
- Gourmet Grilled Cheese
- Build your own Poutine
- Deep Fried Cupcake (be still my heart... do really be still...)

Fantastic food, perfect for those sought after hang over afternoons and they even have tons artery clogging delicacies for vegetarians and vegans! (because everyone deserves a heart attack!)

There are 10 local, microbrew and imported beers on tap and they service food until 2am (just in case you want to do it all over again!)"}
{"text":"Tired to have a drink here on Friday.  After waiting 15 minutes for the waitress we left.  Off to somewhere that wanted to give us service!"}
{"text":"I just moved into the neighborhood and was told time and time again that Disgraceland was the best bar in the neighborhood for cheap beer and food. It was with high hopes that I finally checked the place out.

Unfortunately I wasn't super unimpressed. The prices for beer were good, I guess. I hope you don't want anything other than beer though, because its all overpriced. I anticipated some great food after the talk I had heard, but it was very underwhelming and kinda overpriced for what it was. And the service? Just meh. 

I may go back and give it a second try, but I'm not nearly as excited about it the second time around."}
{"text":"I went here once for a DJ night and love love loved the place. Not just because of beer selection, not just because the staff were friendly and nice, and not just because everyone there was so fun.

The bar itself has a great setup, lots of room, and feels like a cozy bar home. Love the name, love the decor, love everything about it.

And I didn't even know they had brunch! Sounds exciting.

The only downfall: I'm usually too lazy to go all the way up to Bloor. Yes, I know that is supremely lazy. But I sense I will be coming back. For brunch and brunch cocktails."}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch and it was average. Not terrible but there are just so many better places for brunch for the price I wouldn't recommend going here."}
{"text":"The name is suited. If i was an addict with a stolen cc i would come here. Couches torn apart; smells bad, bathrm nasty, metal music playing....all at premium prices"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place a few years ago when I was in school and lived right around the corner. As a vegetarian on a student budget it was the perfect place to grab some veg-friendly fried food and a pint when everything in my fridge bummed me out. Now, its still a place that I stop in from time to time for similar reasons. Its always been quick, cheap, and chill. Its also got a dive bar thing going on with the music selection and the weird art on the walls*. 

Since I visit only a few times a year now, it seems the menu changes every time I come in. This is generally fine but it breaks my heart when they remove something I love. In this case its the hot dogs (which were available in veg form). I used to visit just for the deliciously trashy Trailer Park dog (Cheese Whiz and crushed potato chips) and now its gone, along with all the other dogs and many of the burgers. All of this is totally within any establishment's right of course. It's just a warning to those potential repeat visitors who may go in expecting to find certain staples. Change is the only constant, as they say.

*Current weird art is plates depicting various cartoons in dried ketchup. Yes, ketchup."}
{"text":"If you want some vegan junk food in your belly and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, this might be your spot.  Disgraceland straddles the line between bar and pub with a strong subculture representation.  Your bartender is likely to be heavily pierced and/or tattooed (as are most of the patrons) and drinks are on the cheaper side.  The music is usually pretty good and depending on the evening, you may catch some entertainment  as well.  An all around fun spot to hang out and catch a few drinks in an otherwise pretty boring neighborhood for it."}
{"text":"A friend of mine introduced me to Disgraceland saying that it had the best vegan food. She wasn't kidding! We came on a weekday around 3pm so we were the only ones in the restaurant as it wasn't too busy. 

I had their \"Vegan Butter Chicken\" wrap and for 13$, it was a huge wrap. I could only finish half of it and had to take the rest to go. Many people don't like the taste of imitation meat, but I didn't find this issue with the food here. My friend had the \"Vegan Rib-wich\" and for 12$, it tasted exactly like ribs back when I used to eat pork. We also shared the \"Popcorn Tofu\" since its description caught my attention (Bite sized KFC-style battered tofu with coleslaw and vegan friendly gravy). I couldn't pass it up and I was so glad I didn't. The texture isn't exactly like what you would expect of popcorn chicken, but it was very close. 

Other reviews have stated that the service is slow and isn't the best. I would agree with this which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. Nonetheless, it didn't bother me too much as I was still very impressed with the food. 

The environment has a bar-like atmosphere with a rocker type vibe. There is also a huge TV screen at the back of the restaurant that played music videos while I was there. 

Overall, I would come back for the food. I hope to try more of their other options. Im sure I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"GOURMET GRILLED CHEESE ALERT!

Yep, it's true. The grilled cheese sandwich at Disgraceland qualifies as a gourmet and is currently the top contender in my quest for Toronto's ultimate grilled cheese sandwich - even though it had three types of cheese on it the portion was modest and it was totally manageable. Oozy monterey jack, cheddar and goat, yum. The spiced shoestring fries that came with the sandwich were blindingly good and I couldn't stop eating them.

Might I add that I ordered said sandwich at nearly 1am?? Add Disgraceland to the list of Toronto's reliable late night places to eat!

Finally, even though it was a Saturday night the bar wasn't busy and most people were eating and talking, yet the \"DJ\" (term used very loosely here) chose to blast the music to an almost unlistenable volume. This was OK when shuffle landed on a-ha's \"The Sun Always Shines On TV\" (their biggest hit worldwide, ahem) and Junior Boys' \"In The Morning\", but NOT OK when it came to the most egregious error of allowing 90s techno to come onto the scene. Volume needs to be lowered for sure.

Cash only."}
{"text":"I was excited to bring my vegetarian boyfriend here after learning about the mostly vegetarian/vegan menu!  I usually love \"dive bars\", but Disgraceland was just in bad shape.  Seats torn, overwhelming musty smell, dust, dirt, dark (but NOT in a good way).

The food was TERRIBLE -- very bland.   This was the worst part of the whole experience.  I will not come back."}
{"text":"A dive bar in all the best ways.  Grungy, weird, eclectic and a lot of fun.  That and the food is actually pretty amazing.  They have vegetarian versions of just about everything and do them exceptionally well.  Its greasy and terrible for you but it tastes good in a way vegetarians don't get to do very often.  I'm not vegetarian but that's the sentiment form those I take here who are.  Add to all of this board games, arcade and great music and it is a unique, fun spot to hang out."}
{"text":"Until last night I had somehow avoided Disgraceland... I'm not sure how. It was Jess P's birthday and we took over two large booths at the back for a good ol' fashioned drunken Monday. 

I had a grilled cheese. It was delicious, gooey and well made on a nice sweet bread. The servers were fast and funny, but the place was out of ginger ale for the evening... annoying! It is the champagne of soda after all. I didn't feel like beer, so was drinking whiskey-lime-soda. This wasn't great... but I kept ordering them so I can't really complain. 

The menu creates a mecca for drunk vegans, so if that's you, run to Disgraceland.

I'll be back, and I'll try the pool tables!

NB: Cash only. They'll let you run a tab, but you have to pay cash at the end of the night. If you don't mind banking fees they have a bank machine."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to check this place out for the past couple of months. To be fair, this neighbourhood is a bit boring. I appreciate the quiet but at the same time, I like accessibility. My friend and I were in the mood for cheap beer and comfort pub grub. I figured we should meet here. 

This place fit the bill. Taxes included in all there prices, so we just had to add in tip and done! They have $14 of PBR everyday which is fine and their food wasn't anything special. I had the turkey club with mashed potatoes, both were dry but would be improved with gravy. Service was good and accommodating. 

You get what you need from a dive bar. It's got a cool vibe, good tunes and a bookshelf of board games  which might be nice another time. I might hit this place up once in a while, merely due to its 3 blocks radius to my apartment. 

Check it out."}
{"text":"Man, I wish the service had been faster here- I want to love this place but we spent half the visit chasing down staff for food and drink. All that to say, we definitely didn't stay as long as we had initially planned for.

On the flip, the beer was reasonably priced and dee-liche, and the french fry order was bountiful (we're talking a mountain of perfect fries). If we had had bigger appetites the menu seems generally great with lotsa vegan stuff. We visited later at night and while the place is pretty dark and dingy (my favorite kinda dive) they keep the atmosphere lively with a large projection of old horror and sci-fi films at the back.

Dearest Disgraceland, please up your service game, you're so great otherwise!"}
{"text":"Great place for people looking for a late night bite. Everything can be made vegan, except for the deep find Mars bars, and it's all pretty solid. It's cash only, which can be troublesome, but good food at decent prices. Good hangout location for vegetarians and vegans. It's definitely a more edgy and hipster vibe in here, but don't worry, they're all harmless. Good thing is nobody will care if you ask to change the tv from the weird channels to the local sports. Great selection of alcohol and pitchers are not too pricey from what I can recall. Give it a try!"}
