{"text":"5 Stars  outstanding service and food was outstanding . A great place to have a special dinner"}
{"text":"We had a group of 10 people, and we had great service the whole night. We had a variety of appetizers and sides, all good. I had the ny strip... excellent. And the donuts are hot and tasty!"}
{"text":"One of the best steaks and donut deserts I've  had. Expensive but you pay for what you get. Great service,  food, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently ate here for the first time. The atmosphere was very nice but it was also VERY loud, to the point we could barely hear our waiter. We did eat here on a Saturday night and it was packed but still every restaurant was. Our waiter was so...so...he took awhile to get our drinks and then take our order. I saw another table get the manager because the same waiter was taking forever to take their order as well. We ordered the shrimp cocktail and French onion soup for our appetizers, both of them were fantastic. Then our main dishes arrived, we both got the usda filets, a side order of mashed potatoes, sautéed mushrooms, and a lobster tail. Everything was great except my filet was undercooked, we both ordered our steaks medium and my wife's was fine but mine was very red in the center and bloody. Overall I gave this place 3 out of 5 stars, because the service was lacking, my steak being undercooked and then the price, which was $183 dollars for our meal seemed a bit much for what we got. I would probably give this place another try since it was our first time. Also I HIGHLY recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try Red since we moved back to Cleveland last year.  We walked in without reservations early tonight (Friday) around 5:15.  We were greated promptly and seated immediately. Our server told us the specials immediately so we could order an appropriate wine.  With that info we ordered wine, appetizers and entree all at once. The wine and bread came out soon thereafter allowing us to enjoy both.  We had the roasted beet and arugula salad which was light and delicious. My wife had the grouper special which had some spice.  I had the bone-in rib steak which was done to the perfrct temperature and the garlic fries as a side. We both give Red our highest rating and are glad to see an extremely high quality steakhouse in the Gateway District that is accessable to downtown residents and visitors alike."}
{"text":"Had dinner Friday night.  Filet Oscar was made with king crab.  Possibly the best steak I've ever had!  Side of green beans was delicious, service was great, go there."}
{"text":"After leaving our kids at home my wife and I were able to enjoy ourselves without their bickering and fighting.  My wife ordered the rib-eye and I had the New York Strip.  Steaks were done to perfection.  For the sides we shared the \"Risotto of the Day\" and \"Brussels Sprouts & Pancetta\".  A very good meal.  I would easily recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at Red until last night. My birthday dinner with family. Soon as our party sat down my sister got a splinter deep in her hand from the chairs which clearly were so worn and cracked. We asked for tweezers which they found for us. The server was really awesome. But the manager on two occasions I addressed a few things our chairs and my sister getting a splinter.  Then everyone's food came out steaks so charred dry you couldn't cut and that's not medium. The pasta was so dry and sticky. Gross. The red salad was the worst I've ever had. So dry. I couldn't believe how awful everything was. I brought this to the attention of the same manager who had an attitude of he could care less. We've been to both locations and this was just the worst experience at any Red location. They seemed to be more concerned about getting in as many people they could than the quality of the food and service. And the best part was nothing was comped for our bad experience and my sisters splinter which we could not get out. Most sent their food back and didn't eat. Would never expect my birthday at Red to be such a failure. This manager is awful! This is our fav place and they got it all wrong! Won't be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Two weeks ago had a great steak dinner. This week outstanding linguine and clams in white sauce. Bar service is great, Dave does an amazing job."}
{"text":"Wowzers, I nearly made a mess in my trousers - my experience was that satisfying! I was treated to a birthday dinner at Red by my lovely GF and it was a fantastic night: sleek and sexy ambiance; waitstaff that was doting without being intrusive; and food that exceeded expectations (even at the $$$$ price point). We started with the tuna tartare which was beautifully seasoned, unctuous, and velvety in the mouth - the best tartare I've had in Cleveland. The chef has somehow managed to make a roasted beet salad as rich as the steak for which this place is known; definitely not your typical \"add on\" salad. My porterhouse was one of the best steaks I've had, and had an excellent sear. But the TRUFFLE WHIPPED POTATOES - my God, these are not \"truffle mashed potatoes\" as most people know them (which only contain garden variety truffle oil), THESE potatoes are flecked with enough black truffle to make them dessert-level decadent.  Definitely not an every-week spot for us (I wish), but for a special occasion meal, it's hard to beat Red."}
{"text":"This restaurant is 4 stars for the service and some of food, but i was underwhelmed with the main event: the steak. I ordered a CAB prime filet, which was a little over cooked, but not worth complaining about in my opinion. It was very tender and decent quality, but i just wasn't that impressed. I've been to some of the best steak houses in the U.S. and I hate to say it since Cleveland is my city, but this one didn't measure up. To be honest, though, I would go back just for the macaroni and cheese. That was amazing! Definitely keep that on the menu. Same thing with the gnocchi, that was also delicious. The dessert donuts were also superb. Service was excellent, no complaints there. Just wish the steak was better!"}
{"text":"We have been to Red in Beachwood many many times and never disappointed. But what a huge disappointment the downtown location has been.  We have been to Red downtown 3 times since it's opening in November and with each visit things have NOT improved.  The service is terrible.  The noise in the main dining room is so loud you can't hear the person next to you speak at all.  The food has been just average.  So needless to say hopefully things improve for them but we will not be returning for awhile."}
{"text":"This is probably a top 10 steakhouse in the country, right in Cleveland. Atmosphere, service, drinks, and of course food are top notch. It costs a lot but this isn't a meant to be a bargain"}
{"text":"Best steak house in Cleveland by far ! My wife and I shared everything. Started with the wedge salad. Followed by 22oz bone in Rib Eye med rare in which they were kind enough to slice for us . Accompanied with our steak, we had the cream corn and gnocchi as sides . For dessert the small order of doughnuts which comes with three dipping sauces . Chocolate , caramel and raspberry . It honestly doesn't get any better than this my fellow clevelanders !  Excellent food and service !"}
{"text":"First the food: Fantastic filet and Gratin potatoes. The Bearnaise was spot on, too. If food was the only consideration this would get five stars from me.  The pre-dinner bread with grated cheeses in oil seems like a good premise, but the execution leaves a little to be desired. No biggie, though. It's definitely passable.   This steakhouse is not a large place. We arrived at 4:00 PM -  before they were seating in the dining room - and were told we could sit at the bar for an hour and then eat at the bar or come back for a table at 8:00 pm. We opted for a table later and hit up the taco place next door for a snack. (Bonus!) When the place was empty it looked clean and interesting.   When we came back for our dinner seating the place was pretty full. You could see the issues with the size. There was a party of four waiting for a table. It was enough to block all the staff trying to move around the area and gum up the whole front. When we were seated, though, it was even more telling that the design is appealing to the eye, but not well thought out. We were so close to our dining neighbors, I bet lots of people would not have been able to get into the seating area where we were seated.  The table for two is pretty small. The worst part of it all was that it was louder than a middle school cafeteria if the whole staff had left the building. Even when half the tables in the place were empty it was unbearably loud. (On a Tuesday night.) There was a concert going on, but the concert goers would have been gone by 8 pm, so it wasn't them.   Our server Barbara was friendly and we had everything we needed. I go through several glasses of water at every meal and she kept up with me well enough that I always had  water.   I doubt I will return because the atmosphere was not up to par for this type of meal. If you want to nearly shout to be heard by your dining companions this will be right in your wheelhouse. It wasn't relaxing for us at all.   If I was at a nearby hotel and wanted to eat in my room I would definitely consider carry out!"}
{"text":"Red is expensive. You are going to spend a pretty penny here, but don't let that stop you from the experience. Red is delicious, and the filet I ate here is the best piece of meat I've ever sank my teeth into.  Let's start with the ambience and decor. Classy, upscale, minimal. We sat in the lounge. I've read reviews where guests complained about the lounge. After checking out the main dining room, I actually prefer the lounge. It's a more lively crowd and the red walls really give the room some 'pop.'   Onto the food.  We started off with the steak tartar and the Florida stone crab, a special that night. The steak tartar was good, but very heavy on whatever herb or onion was mixed in. The crostini was the perfect amount of crispness and thickness. I was expecting more out of the presentation though, especially at that price point. It was as if the presentation was just an afterthought and didn't even matter. The Florida stone crab was fine. The mustard aioli that came with it was to die for and really gave the crab some oomph.   We then split the wedge salad. I'm a big fan of wedge salads, so there isn't much else to say.   Steak. Steak. Steak. We split a filet. It was so damn good. Literally cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning. The filet was so good I wish we would have ordered with the larger portion. Now when it comes to the sides, less is more. They are huge. That's the reason why they are $10 each. They are meant to be served and eaten family style. So if it is just two of you, I would recommend only ordering two. We went with the truffle whipped potatoes and the creamed spinach. Both were really good, but the truffle whipped potatoes has the edge. We're suckers for truffles. My beef (pun intended) with the creamed spinach was how heavy it was. I can only imagine how much butter and cream they are cooked in. One or two bites and you're done.  For dessert we split the hazelnut torte. Our server described it as being very similar to Ferrero Rocher, and he was spot on. It was super rich. It was served with pomegranate seeds and whipped cream. I'm assuming the whipped cream was homemade. I'm not a huge whipped cream person, but I definitely could have used some more of that. The crunch from the pomegranate seeds was a nice touch of texture.  All in all, I would definitely return to Red but only for special occasions because of the price points. I personally find it to be a bit overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"One star is too generous. We went there tonight to celebrate a special occasion. There were ten of us. The server was guaranteed her 20% and was neglectful. Drinks were repeatedly left unfilled, requested items had to be asked for repeatedly and she looked at us with a quizzical look like she had never heard our requests previously. We had heard many times about the delicious food we would be treated to... Unfortunately that was not the case. All the food was covered in salt. We specifically requested no salt and yet they smothered everything in salt. They did take the lamb off the bill but it was truly too little, too late. We spent a lot of money for food that left us underwhelmed. The sides were inconsistent- either burnt or undercooked. It really didn't matter because the salt level was the star of this meal. Someone in the kitchen was heavy- handed with the salt. Half the steaks were overcooked or undercooked. A child received a rare bloody steak... Definitely not what was ordered! The desserts came out and by that point half the people left because they felt sick after ingesting the huge amounts of salt. The desserts should have been light and fluffy. Save time and money and just go to Dunkin' Donuts. We were promised a steak that would melt in our mouths, but instead we choked on disappointment. Go to Pier W or Hyde Park if you want a delicious meal, because you won't get one at Red!"}
{"text":"The food were was awesome. The decor is trendy and service very friendly and efficient. We walked in without a reservation (although I was told that was very lucky) and sat down at the bar. Started off with the stuffed hot peppers- probably one of the best I've ever had. For entree had the filet mignon which was delicious as well, cooked slightly rarer then preferred but still very tasty, juicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"Ehhhh. My New York strip was supposed to be medium rare, came medium (close to medium well). No big deal, I'm not that picky. I figured I would still enjoy the steak given the reputation of the house. Not quite, however. Some strange tasting concoction (sauce perhaps?) prevented me from actually tasting the meat. Everybody else in the party really liked their dishes. So maybe it was just me. And the price point is something to consider as well."}
{"text":"I went to this location with a party of 6, with some younger children.  I am not typically a fan of bringing children, but this was a special occasion.  My expectations were high based upon the price point and the reviews I had heard from patrons of the other Red locations.  The service was very prompt.  I tend to drink a lot of water my glass rarely fell below half full.  The restaurant was not busy, but the pace of the dinner was a little slow for having the younger children with us.  Fortunately, the children were well behaved and the length of the dinner did not impact that aspect (a little over two hours).  The appetizers were good.  Brad's Stuffed Hot Peppers were great.  The crab cakes were fine, not the best, not the worst.  Likewise, the calamari was satisfactory.    I ordered a Prime Ribeye as did a couple others in my party.  It was very comparable to other steaks I have had at other upscale steakhouses in the city.  Not the best, not the worst, but certainly closer to the top.  Perfectly cooked to my liking.  The salads were fine.  The sides were quite good.  The truffle mashed potatoes were excellent.  We also had macaroni and cheese which was very good, perhaps slightly too rich for me, but everyone else really enjoyed it.  The asparagus was fine, but unremarkable.  We did not have desserts, but they did treat us to some fresh doughnuts.  They were very good, and fairly light.  I would certainly consider ordering them at a future dinner.  Overall a very good dinner.  You can tell in some ways that it is a new restaurant and they are working out the kinks, but nothing that isn't easily overlooked.  This restaurant will receive serious consideration the next time I am in Pittsburgh looking for an upscale steak dinner."}
{"text":"It's not always great dining alone when you are traveling on business. But Red's is the exception--amazing maitre d', great service and wonderful food. I was checked on by the manager, maitre d' and my server throughout the evening, and madero feel like a VIP. Highly recommended, especially if you are at the Marriott Residence Inn next  door."}
{"text":"Got Salt?? My girlfriend and I went to Red downtown for the first time last night for dinner.   All my friend have talked about this unbelievable  steakhouse in downtown Cleveland, so we were both excited to finally go.  The atmosphere is classy  at the restaurant, but the food was below average and way overprices in my opinion for what you get.    We ordered a 14oz New York USDA Prime Steak that was $45 and it was very salty. Our sides included mushrooms that were so salty we sent them back, a loaded baked potato for $9 that came with butter and bacon bits, (last time i check  a loaded baked potato should have sour cream, cheese, chives), i have had better at Wendy's for $2, and green beans that were very salty.     The manager was nice to take  off the salt lick (mushrooms) off of our bill so we saved $12, but my overall eating experience was horrible.   I have had better steaks and sides at Outback for half the price.   I have no problem paying $45 for a steak if it was good.  I will never go back to Red Steakhouse downtown unless I'm looking  for overpriced, below average food."}
{"text":"I visited Red for my boyfriend's birthday last weekend and we both thoroughly enjoyed everything about our experience.  I loved the atmosphere and the staff was very knowledgeable and attentive.  We started with a bottle of wine and had mussels and tomato mozzarella as our appetizers which was a great start.  My boyfriend got the fillet and raved about it the whole time.  I'm a vegetarian so I ordered a few sides for my meal which was more than enough to share.  Our sides were asparagus, \"tater tots\", mashed potatoes, and mac & cheese.  My only complaint was that they didn't remove enough of the ends on the asparagus (stringy ends) but that was not enough to go down a star.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Was so disappointed. Thought I was choosing one of the top steakhouses in downtown Cleveland. Actually was more like a subpar, overpriced experience.  Service was negligible, the steak itself was barely good, and everything was more expensive than it ought to have been based on the quality received.  We wouldn't return."}
{"text":"My friends and I, who frequently dine at some of Cleveland's best restaurants were left dumbfounded when we were asked to leave Red last evening 4/10 after asking politely for a 5th chair to be added to our table. The GM also thought it was necessary to have the police join him. As civilized adults, we didn't want to cause a scene so we left without question. I know, it sounds like something to the story is missing, but that's the crazy thing- their isn't. We were not loud, belligerent, or rude. We simply intended to have a nice meal after the Cleveland Indians Home Opener. We will not return to this location, nor will we recommend it to those who ask."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new steakhouse. Great location, great atmosphere, and the waitress was very nice. The food was absolutely terrible. I ordered the ny strip prime medium rare and the steak was nearly well done. The truffle mashed potatoes that  the waitress suggested came out crusted on the top and very dry. These potatoes tasted and like they came out of a box and the presentation was awful. Now back to the over cooked steak ... it was dry aged which I already understand has a different flavor and have had many times at Hyde Park. This steak was so salty and dry that I ate the mashed potatoes only so I could get the dry steak down. Overall nice staff,  but the for the price point I would expect much better. I won't be coming back there are MANY better options in Pittsburgh.... oh how could I forget. We ordered the small seafood tower  appetizer- calamari was phenomenal however the shrimp was still frozen."}
{"text":"First time in Cleveland to attend the RNC. We literally stumbled into Red as it was located right outside the security perimeter. And are we ever glad we did! The food was sensational, the service friendly and prompt. You won't be disappointed in anything you order. Try the lemon garlic shrimp appetizer, any of the beef dishes. My salmon was cooked to perfection. Favorite sides - portions large enough for several - cauliflower au gratin and whipped mashed potatoes. I'm a cheesecake aficionado and theirs was terrific."}
{"text":"Lovely place! Great crowd and good vibes. The crab cakes were wonderful. My friend and I lost track of time while chatting and the staff was still so friendly and warm. Will definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"I had ordered a ribeye steak. I don't know what I got but, it was great!! I have been there once before and it's the BEST steak I have ever had. The next time I'm in town I WILL stop in again and if I have time I'll call them out on the steak cut I ordered last time. ONE PROBLEM ! Once you have their steak all others you thought you loved won't be good enough anymore. I used to like the ribeye at Texas Road House now I can tolerate it."}
{"text":"This place is truly expensive. Was there last night. In spite of wearing a sweater I was cold (ik it was zero outside but I did notice a thermostat on the wall which remained untouched) . I asked management to turn up the heat but they said they couldn't. And glass was a poor insulator which sounds like a poor excuse . We waited a loooong time for food and had to practically beg for rolls (bread). We were given one small roll each. And when we asked for more bread we received 1 more small roll each.  Including tip dinner was about 200 for 2 and I didn't even drink. Basically 3 salads 2 steaks fries 1 drink for my wife and coffee for me. No dessert. As you can see by the time stamp we left after 10pm but sat down at 730pm.  We waited a long time for salads and  over an hour for entrees. On a positive note my steak was cooked how I like it. I did tip the waiter well in spite because he said he was ex military and I respect that alot."}
{"text":"I live in New York City and was here in Cleveland oh on a business trip and a friend of mine recommended this Restaurant. I have to say they have one of the best steaks and sides ever!! I  will place this establishment so far in my top 3 steak restaurants ! Only thing I am mad about is that this restaurant is not in NYC! To we meat Again. Did you catch the Pun (Lol)."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Red. Service was great and the filet's we had were cooked to perfection. Our server told us they were working on opening a location in Pittsburgh. Can't wait until it opens."}
{"text":"The waiter gave excellent service (even if he didn't introduce himself). The atmosphere was great. The food, for the most part, was exactly what we expected. Our only complaint comes from the risotto we ordered as one of our side dishes. It tasted undercooked a bit. It was one of the things on the specials list for the night, so maybe staying away from the specials is a good way to go. Their wine list is fabulous, though; and as I said, the waiter was on top of things. He did a great job at keeping us happy throughout our dinner and even had some great suggestions on where to go next for some after-dinner fun."}
{"text":"Absolutely 5 stars for Reds!  My father and I were just in Cleveland to visit the R&R HOF and had an absolutely phenomenal experience at Reds.  I was craving a high end steakhouse experience that would live up to my Chicago standards and Reds far exceeded expectations.    Starting with the expansive wine list, available list of scotches and other cocktails, Reds knows how to create a swanky, upscale and modern steakhouse experience.  When I spend this much on steak I stick to the basics...wedge salad and NY strip (USDA Prime though they also offer Angus).  Dad had the bone in ribeye that looked great as well along with a chopped salad to start.  My steak was freaking awesome!  Cooked perfectly (medium plus...i love that they actually had a \"medium plus\") with a thick crust on the outside and heavily seasoned, which I prefer.  If you don't like your steak heavily seasoned you may want to let them know in advance but for me it was perfect.  Wedge salad was excellent, with crispy cold lettuce, sharp blue cheese, a bit of red onion  and ranch...loved it.  Even the pre-meal bread with EVOO was done well with a custom made spice mix.    I could go on but I'm busy running my ass back to Reds!  I loved it and highly recommend it.  Oh service was impeccable (but not stuffy at all) also."}
{"text":"Well, somewhere buried under the salt was a good NY strip. That about sums it up. For the price, I would consider it a poor meal. The service was very good, and the sides we got were probably the best part of the meal. You can find better meals (as in farm to table really good food) in Pittsburgh for a lot less money."}
{"text":"Meh. Given the price point, I expected more from the steak. There was entirely too much salt/seasoning on the NY strip. So much that I was scraping it off so I could actually taste the meat. The sides were pretty disappointing, too. Almost flavorless.  The server was attentive, but our meal lasted over 2.5 hours on Saturday night."}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere, and I don't even eat steak!  Had the lobster tail.  A lot of outdoor seating and a cool rooftop."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for some business and decided to go to Red for a dinner with a friend.   Ordered a 8oz steak with some mashed potatoes. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had . And also very expensive. Not all good things in life come cheap- and Red steakhouse is one of those. You get what you pay for.   I'd go back again for one of those steaks again if I had the chance.  It was perfectly cooked- the steak remained warm until the last cut. Usually by the time you get to the 8th oz, it's cold and chewy but RED managed to find a way to keep their meat warm tasty and juicy all the way to the last bite.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Amazing steak house. Steak cooked at such a high heat that they sear them perfectly.  My USDA cut of ribeye was absolutely done perfect. Sides were great for 2 people.  Wine list was thorough and offered a lot of variety. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I visited here for the first time to see basketball game from Japan. I referred this  site and tried RED. The result was Correct . As I attached photos, I started with appetizers of tuna tartar and lemon shrimp, which are both good for us who always eat seafood. All dishes were served timely. I had filet mignon with rare. It was a real \"rare \" even if it is a rare case in USA that steak is served rare when I order rare and usually served medium. In addition, they have a variation of wines from a reasonable one to an expensive one. I selected a middle class of Napa and that was correct (^o^)"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Cleveland. They really do it right. Great food, ambiance and service."}
{"text":"I visited Red for a business lunch, with a reservation that we probably did not need during the Tuesday lunch hour. Still, I was greeted kindly and immediately upon arrival, and seated right away. Our waitress, Katie, was polite and attentive--but she didn't hover, which I liked. I had the risotto of the day, a tomato-y, cheesy version with many other ingredients that I cannot recall. It tasted quite good, and our food came promptly.  In addition, because I was there for business, I truly appreciated how quiet the restaurant was, but it would be hard for me to say if that is in its nature of if it was only the result of there being so few patrons at that time.   There are two reasons I cannot give Red 5 stars. First, some of their items are simply overpriced, and it's oddly discomforting that all of their prices end in .9. That said, their lunch prices seem more reasonable than their dinner prices. My risotto was $12.90. Second, I did become sick after eating there, and although I cannot confirm that it was the result of something I ate at Red, it did make me a bit leery of it.   Still, I would probably go back and give them another try."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The steaks were cooked to perfection. I had the filet and my husband had the ribeye. I salt everything before I even taste it, not necessary here. We also split the risotto. God was it good.  Service was excellent also, from the hostess to the busy boy everyone was friendly and polite."}
{"text":"The food is good.   Tuna tartar was was great.  Stuffed peppers tasty.  The halibut entree was a bit dry.  Steaks come out properly cooked, but on a cold plate.  Really?           The staff is pompous, and they treat you poorly... A bit surprising at this price point.  Hope they can figure out the attitude problem.  I'll dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"I travel quite a bit on business, and get to eat at many steakhouses around the country.  Red is as good, if not better, as any of them.  I wandered in alone tonight, got a seat at the bar, had a great meal.  The service was spot on and the food was superb.  The ribeye steak I had was as flavorful and well cooked as any I've had.  Accompanied by a wedge salad and some fresh sauteed spinach, it was a great meal.  I recommend their house red wine, it was excellent.  This was not my first time here, but every time has been worth the visit.  It's not cheap, but it's good!"}
{"text":"Went a while ago with my boyfriend but Red did not disappoint. Everyone should ask for Mark M. If they want formal, knowledgeable, and not overly bearing service. The food was amazing. What more can you say. Way better than service at Mortons where the server actually narrated the whole service and explained why she was bringing me a steak knife for my $50 steak..."}
{"text":"I am so excited that Red came to downtown Cleveland and I cannot wait to go again. We were here for a birthday celebration and our server couldn't be any better. The fillet mignon is to die for and the tater tots are an amazing side. The doughnuts dessert with the 3 different sauces is a great combination of sweet and sour, the dough was soft and melts in your mouth. The martinis are pricy (like every steakhouse) but really good quality. I heard they have happy hour so I will try more martinis then. I would recommend this place to anyone trying to score some points with a special one or any celebration because you will be so glad you chose the right place."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Service was great. One of the best steaks I have ever had. This place was a hit with our whole team. :) Will visit here again if we ever go back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. We went there for my dad's birthday and everything was amazing. The service was fantastic, the drinks were delicious and the steaks were to die for. My dad also got a lobster tail, and even though it was the larger one, it was still very sweet. I had one of the best steaks in my life. My mouth is watering now just remembering it. Then for dessert, the gave us some of the homemade donuts on the house, which were heaven. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Truffle Mashed Potatoes.  I could eat them everyday so it's probably a good thing I don't live downtown or in Beachwood. I have never found a potato or a steak that compare to the amazingness that is Red, The Steakhouse!  I have been here a few times and every experience is the same in the best way. The steaks are always cooked to perfection and my knife always just glides through on every cut. The steaks here just melt in your mouth! The crazy thing is even the free bread is fantastic! it is served with a Parmesan and olive oil dip that has so much flavor. I have only ever had the donuts for dessert so I am biased in my opinion of how amazing these are too! The raspberry syrup is my favorite dipping sauce out of the three (caramel and chocolate also included).   This is definitely a special occasion place but worth every shiny penny!   Note: The location downtown offers lunch."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with friends mostly b/c it was convenient for all 3 of us.  Service was fine, we stayed and talked a bit.  2 out of 3 had salads and they were ok, nothing special at all.  Added chicken on my cobb salad and it was pretty tasteless.  Its truly overpriced which they are likely stuck with given the rent but no reason to charge $23 for salad and ice tea and a teeny little roll.  Quite ridiculous."}
{"text":"Had a veal sandwich for lunch and it was delicious.  Cooked and seasoned, and presented in a man-sized portion.  Service was top notch.  Thoroughly enjoyed my visit and will be back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the best steaks of my entire life.  My wife and I were here this past weekend to celebrate our 21st anniversary with a \"special occasion\" restaurant...and Red fits that bill to a tee.  From the moment we entered the space, the staff was attentive and accommodating to all of our needs.  The meal started off with warm rolls and a crumbled cheese soaked in olive oil mix.  Great way to kick things off while we sipped on our bottle of red wine from Lodi (I believe it was called Earthquake).  Each of us decided to order an 8oz filet in their USDA Prime category...they have three different categories of beef, each one increasingly more tender and flavorful.  For toppers, I chose the horseradish creme fraiche and my wife chose the blue cheese.  For sides, we split orders of the truffle whipped potatoes and the asparagus with bearnaise sauce.  We both asked for our steaks to be cooked medium-rare-plus, and that is exactly how they came out...perfect!  I enjoyed the horseradish sauce I chose, but my wife's blue cheese was absolutely to die for!  Luckily, the server was nice enough to share the brand name with us, so we can try and re-create the dish at home (thanks Scott!).  Both sides were quite tasty.  The truffle whipped potatoes were luscious and creamy, definitely enough for more than two people.  The asparagus appeared wilted, but still had a \"snap\" to them when chewed, and the bearnaise sauce was also creamy and a perfect compliment to the vegetables.  After our meal, my wife ordered a coffee and Scott brought us a complimentary order of their fresh, house-made donuts along with three dipping sauces - red raspberry, caramel and milk chocolate.  The chocolate was good, the caramel better and (surprisingly) the red raspberry was superb!  It had the flavor of a traditional jelly-filled donut, but all grown up.  Delicious!  As a final \"treat\", we were served four small squares of a blonde brownie topped with coconut frosting with shaved orange peel on top.  A great ending to a perfect dining experience.  Thanks Red, for taking such good care of us on our special night."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! A MUST stop in Cleveland!! Steak first! Truffled mash potatoes & broccoli are to die for and you NEED to get the doughnuts, too!!!"}
{"text":"I can say this was very possibly the best meal I've ever had. I had the 40 day aged 16 Oz ribeye with broiled garlic on top and it was nothing short of amazing. The family style sides were excellent too, I'd strongly recommend the gnocchi.  They also sent us over a free dessert when we told the waitress we were recently married and having a nice dinner to celebrate.  A bit pricy but well worth it. If you have 250 to spend on a steak dinner in Cleveland, make it here."}
{"text":"Most overrated steakhouse I've ever been to.  Check in was great, they accommodated moving our reservation up from 8:30 to 7:45 with no problem.  The dining room was only 2/3 full upon arrival. Our waiter, Adam, was the worst!! In a 2.5 hour meal that cost $550 for 5 people, we saw him a total of 3 times.  He had such a craptastic attitude and was so disengaged.  We waited a very long time for our bottle of wine and we also waited a while for our dirty dishes to clear.  When we poured my taste of wine after it was opened, he left the bottle on the table and we had to pour our own glasses.  People who had cocktails didn't get a single question from Adam to refill the drink, so rude.    When we asked him for suggestions between mushrooms and mushrooms/onions his response was \"well if you like onions, get mushrooms and onions\".  WOW thanks for the help.  On top of all of that, it was just average quality food.  Wilted house salad, so sad looking.  We ordered Mac n cheese (watery), Brussels, and mushroom sides and the mushrooms/onions were the only thing worth while.   The appetizers (tuna, stuffed peppers, & calamari) were so disappointing.  The tuna didn't taste fresh at all.  I wasn't eating at a 5 star restaurant.   The giant plates come out with small, over crusted pieces of meat that you want to love but just couldn't.  My filet tasted over charred on the outside.    It was not a good experience at all and I won't be returning.  Mostly because of the poor service.."}
{"text":"Snuck in before the CAVS game. The hostess said we needed a reservation for any time before 7 (game time) but recommended we take the last four bar spots. Glad we did as we had great service and meal. All 4 of us had the 40 day aged 16oz ribeye. Brussel sprouts and scalp potatoes were great. Bartender picked an average red blend but that was priced great. I will return to check out the dining room service as I assume it will be better then the bar."}
{"text":"I was there for a company dinner. The food is good....but our server had to be high as a kite! Bloodshot eyes and all. It was unusual to say the least. I have been there several times. There seems to be a bit of attitude there. They are busy restaurant  and the staff is not nearly as nice when they are busy...  especially before the Cavs games."}
{"text":"Great flavored steaks a bit on the pricey side but worth the experience..also wifey favorite restaurant and we will be back soon.. I want to try the bone in steak but it sold out both times I've been there.. Maybe three time is the charm.."}
{"text":"Went to Beachwood Red a lot and this was just as good. Great filets, cauliflower and cheese, and Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"Be sure you have a great date that likes to share ;0) the food is amazing, Judith was our waitress, she has a great personality with wonderful attention to detail. Oyster were fresh and delicate, salads (beet and arugula and the heirloom tomato), dinner - recommend one order a steak and the other the crab or any of the seafood offerings. Wine list is great for the wine enthusiast in the group. Wonderful sides - we had the truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus. Desserts I recommend the chocolate orange bombe and banana toffee cake then mix them ;0) for the pretty bite. What a wonderful experience. Thank you Judith!!! Do yourself a favor and ask for Judith!!!"}
{"text":"Just tried Red for the first time. Very fancy on the inside, it was a nice place to have lunch. However, the food was just not that great. The waiter brought bread and a lemon bean spread before the meals game, and the bread was fantastic. A little bit of garlic and butter, probably the best part of the meal.   I ordered my steak medium, and the waiter even prompted me to tell me that means that there would be some red in the very middle of the pink, which was exactly what I was looking for. However, when the steak came, there was only a little spot of pink and the ends of the steak were very tough. I'm going to chalk this one up to growing pains, and the fact that this restaurant is relatively new, because I do want to try it again after some time passes. I think it has a lot of potential, once the kinks have some time to work themselves out."}
{"text":"Not many steak houses that are as good as red in Cleveland.  Had a very memorable experience with friends.  They made everyone feel special and food was exceptional.  One of the best Ribeyes I have ever had, and I have had them all over the country. Red is as good as any and better than most."}
{"text":"Not the same as before. We used to dine at Red, The Steakhouse quite frequently when we lived in Miami. We were back visiting and were very excited to dine at Red again--we even invited some friends. Found it to be a lot pricier than before, portions of the side dishes are so much smaller, and the steak was very very bland. It saddens me to write this review, but the experience just wasn't the same. We'll be returning to Miami next weekend and are very skeptical to give our once favorite steakhouse another chance due to our most recent experience."}
{"text":"Best steak my husband has ever had! He went for his bachelor party and it was such a great experience for him! His groomsmen can't stop talking about how good the food was too!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place. Unfortunately the experience was horrible.  They forgot my wife's salad. I ordered the 40 day aged ribeye and the food runner dropped it off and said it was a strip.  It was undercooked and tasted like a strip.  They took the steak back and the manager dropped off the new steak.  He said because of the cut it looked like the strip steak. I do not believe this as there was no marbling on the steak and it tasted like a strip. After that the manager never came back or apologized and let the server tell us we could get a free dessert. I felt this was grossly inadequate as my wife didn't get her salad and we had to eat at separate times. Also the amount of attention you get from your server is dictated how many people you have, unfortunately there was only two of us.I recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for a New Years Eve dinner. This establishment is a bit pricey however you will no doubt have one of the best meals in your life. For an appetizer we had lemon garlic shrimp. This appetizer was superb. I can't imagine Reds having a better appetizer. It was that good. For the dinner sides we shared the creamed spinach and the loaded potato gnocchi. I recommend the creamed spinach but we weren't fans of the potato gnocchi. Now for the steak. I had the 40 day dry aged prime ribeye and the wife had the prime ribeye. My steak was excellent but when my wife told me to take a bite of her steak I instantly said to her that is the best steak I have had in my life. The dry aged steak needless to say was not as tender or as tasty as my wife's steak. She dressed her steak with the roasted garlic topping which was the bomb. Wow was that good. I dressed my steak with the Oscar style topping. It was good but not great. With two draft beers dinner for two was $216.00 not including the tip."}
{"text":"Everything is just perfect. Service, food quality, price, interior design, deserts. I had an amazing time."}
{"text":"Great dining experience. Good food, good atmosphere, good wine list. Located close to The Q so I went w clients after the game"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food, zero stars for the service.   I was very excited to dine at Red for the first time to see how it measures up to the other steakhouses that I have tried downtown (Morton's, Ruth's Chris). Unfortunately, our server, Barbara?, was shockingly rude and I was disappointed by the entire experience. I'm not sure if her demeanor was because we were there on the later end of a Tuesday evening, because my boyfriend and I were dressed casually, or something else--regardless, it was unacceptable. From the get-go she would snap at us, cut us off while we were ordering, and consistently treated us in a demeaning manner. Furthermore, we were not provided with utensils for the entrée, she would hastily reach underneath our arms to take silverware without a word, and literally threw the dessert menu at my boyfriend. At that point both of us had lost our appetite for anything and were in disbelief at her behavior the entire evening.   Om another note, we were surrounded by some tables with loud drunk guests and it was difficult to even hear each other across the table. Lobster and sides were good, bread was sub-par. Despite the quality of the food, the other issues of the evening make me reluctant to return."}
{"text":"I work in the building and decided to come in on my lunch break and it took the entire hour. First I stood at the hostess stand for about 3 minutes before she ever acknowledged me. Then I got the house salad with filet skewers and the salad itself was really great but the filet was chewy and well done despite it being described as \"medium\" when it was brought out to me. In addition I realized the server never even asked how I would like it cooked and it slipped my mind at the time..So I guess she took it upon herself to decide medium although as I said it was nowhere near medium. I also never saw my server again after I put in my order. Another person brought it out to me and no one ever stopped by to check in on me. Finally it was ten minutes before my lunch was over and I had to flag down another server to get my check. The service here is extremely lacking, especially for an upscale steak house."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this steakhouse but I had issues throughout the whole dinner. Have visited the Cleveland location and love but this was very disappointing. Full disclosure it is restaurant week so they were likely busier than normal but it did not seem that overly busy at all. Reservations were at 8 and got seated at 845. Did not have the bottle of wine we wanted. They did give us a more expensive bottle for same price which was nice. Main course was good but broccoli did not come out with dinner as on menu, my guest's steak was medium rare instead of medium, they ran out of mash potatoes which they told us when the food came out and had to wait 10-15 minutes for Mac n cheese substitute, and ran out of donuts which again did not tell us until after ordered. To make matters worse we were there until 10:45 and the service was absolutely terrible. The managers tried to make it up with fried Oreos and did not charge us for certain items and upgrades. Finally the icing on the cake. The valet whips my car around which was definitely on for awhile and possibly joyriding. They have a long way to go."}
{"text":"For starters the food was expectedly mediocre and had lack luster presentation. If it hadn't taken TWENTY minutes to reach our table an extra half star might be appropriate. The floor manager had touched tables twice during our visit, before and after meal. That was appreciated and something neither my boyfriend nor I ever experienced except at our friends place where he owns it. That alone is worth a star but when the crowd thinned at the tables we were still waiting. It was busy for a Tuesday night and we are out on a hotel strip. There's chains all within a block of this. Service should be better if not the food as well. We also wound up rushed by the waitress. Would not go back. Not for this price."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for Red Pittsburgh prior to my experience. I have had nothing but wonderful dinners at their Cleveland locations and expected this location to follow suit. While my overall experience was not horrific, it left much to be desired.         I ordered the 40 day dry aged ribeye and the overall flavor was very average. Not what you would expect from an upscale steakhouse like Red, especially at the prices they are charging. Lobster Mac and Cheese and the truffle potatoes were very good, but I didn't come for sides!         If you are able to afford this place and just want the experience, check it out, it's a very cool location with an excellent bar. The dinner service is just ok and you should expect to spend at least 1 1/2 and 2 hours here. If you have saved up for a special occasion, maybe consider elsewhere. There are definitely better places for a prime steak in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We chose RED for my husband's birthday dinner and had an exceptional experience!  Very comfortable booth in bar area, which was still elegant. We ordered the filet mignon & NY Strip, both were cooked to perfection!  We tried the horseradish creme fresh sauce and the Bernaise sauce, both excellent as well.  For sides, we went with the corn casserole and parmesean tater tots - both are a must!! They comped us the donuts for dessert, a nice touch!! We will be back for another special evening out!"}
{"text":"I honestly never thought I would pay $45.00 for a piece of steak on a plate but after eating it only a year ago, I'm still raving about it.  Went back shortly after for appetizers and drinks and they were absolutely amazing. Calamari is my weakness and theirs is phenomenal.   Busy night life and great food for a pretty penny but worth every cent! Love Red. And I'm not even originally from Cleveland"}
{"text":"Very good steakhouse in the center of Cleveland. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The steak(s) are very good. I've had the Porterhouse and the signature ribeye. They are prepared well. I really like the Green bean signature side. The only thing that kept me from giving this steakhouse a 5 star rating, it's a little overpriced considering the location. Overall"}
{"text":"This place is expensive but worth every penny! It was my first time here, and loved it. The service was great, the food was delicious, the best steak I've ever had. We went here to celebrate a friend's birthday. We started with French onion soup and their special of the night tuna served sashimi style. We all order steak which was cooked to perfection. For the sides we ordered the whipped potatoes with gravy, mushroom & onions, and asparagus. Their sidesare served family style so 3 sides for 4 people was more than enough. Ended the night with the molten chocolate cake and their signature doughnuts. Also their wine selection is pretty good. We ordered a bottle of white and red. If you are not sure which wine to get they have a person who will come your table and answer any questions you may have, he was pretty knowledgeable and very nice. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Red a few times now and it's just okay. Nothing special. Good luck if you come to the bar when it's even a little bit crowded because the service is terrible! We waited almost 45 minutes just to get our tab."}
{"text":"That was an excellent veal Marsala! I sometimes hesitate to order veal marsala, because you never really know what you will get. The waiter and waitress at the bar I assured me that this would be the best, they were right, great marsala!  Great menu with  a lot of dry aged steaks,  I will have to try them next time, but the marsala won me over tonight"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Red the Steakhouse last night for a belated Valentines dinner. The meal was amazing. We both ordered the 8 ounce filet and they were cooked perfectly. I ordered the Brussels sprouts for a side and he got the French fries. Both of our sides were great! The best part of the dinner was dessert. We ordered the dessert trio with flourless chocolate cake, donuts, and the cheesecake. The trio was perfect for sharing and a nice way to end a big dinner without feeling overly stuffed. The service was also wonderful. Great dinner overall!!"}
{"text":"Red is by far the best restaurant in CLE! Loved the bone in rib eye. Had the doughnuts for dessert .... DELISH! Wine was fabulous too .... Well done RED !"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and the valet at our hotel highly recommend this place and I must say we were not disappointed! This place has an upscale, trendy appearance, but the food is what sets this place apart from the others.  We had the 16oz ribeye and it was the best I have had in some time. So for all you meat lovers, you must visit Red Steakhouse. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Had the wet-and-dry-aged ribeye, which was underwhelming. Wet-aging is generally silly, I stick to dry-aged, but I was curious about this combination... and I was disappointed. My friend stuck to the dry-aged and was happy, so maybe that's the way to go the next time?  Sides were pretty good, particularly the potato ball/tater tot thing. Broccoli was again underwhelming. Oysters... umm... fresh but not particularly special? Perhaps, since we're not on a coast, I'm being harsh.  Service wasn't quite excellent, but it was close enough.  Verdict: good but not great."}
{"text":"Went here and had a pretty good experience, but I think there are many places in Cleveland where you can find a great steak for a lesser price. Brussel sprouts were amazing. Steak was too charred and garlic covered for my liking, but it was a good cut of meat. Nice experience, but don't think I will go back. Too overpriced."}
{"text":"I'm landing on a 4 for Red the Steakhouse because it's a solid, modern American restaurant with attentive service and good, classic steak.  Some friends and I came during Restaurant Week, which in our opinion, is the best time to go because their regular prices are tend to be expensive. I think it's fair to say that it's quite expensive for a more classic style steak restaurant. The most memorable item was definitely the steak - we had filet mignon medallions that were juicy with decent flavor (for some reason, I don't remember it being that strong!)   The appetizer was comforting but not mind blowing. The dessert was probably my least favorite menu item. Overall, the strength of the restaurant is definitely the steak!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'd had better steaks at Outback or Texas Roadhouse.  That was the fattiest filet I've ever had. Super overpriced at $40, and $10 for each side ($10 for a side of broccoli? You could feed an entire school for that price! Ok, not really, but still... )  Overall, we got in right away on a Saturday evening, but waited an hour and a half for our food to come. I will not return. I make better steaks for a family of 4 at home, for the price of one meal there."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Monday. It was basically empty. The food was fabulous. We shared a half of a bottle of wine and split a Cesar salad to start. For our entrees we ordered salmon and filet. We also had a side of the green beans and an order of the Mac and cheese. For dessert we had the molten chocolate cake."}
{"text":"I was there for dinner on Monday the place is nice and cleen, the food presentation was ok, the steak tasted fine but the portions are small and the price is expensive"}
{"text":"Our first time ever dining at Red Steakhouse and we couldn't be happier!! An absolutely pleasure to dine there!  Gorgeous atmosphere, incredible service and the best C.A.B Prime Filet my husband and I have had since Gordon Ramsey Steak.  A perfect cook on his rare steak and my med-rare which can be hard to do.  We have had issues with this at similar places like Capital Grille and Morton's.  So this was a pleasant surprise!  We began our meal with a dozen oysters which were perfection and the waitress knew exactly where they were from before we had to ask...a plus in my book. Then shared the RED house salad that was perfectly dressed and delicious. Followed by our steaks and two sides of brussel sprouts and the four cheese Mac n cheese with lobster.  The brussel sprouts were delicious but if we had any complaint the 4 cheese mac n cheese wasn't very cheesey and not a lot of lobster to pasta ratio. We would try another starch next time but the flavor was certainly there!  This is a wonderful steakhouse to add to the Pittsburgh area and the menu has many other delicious options such as pastas and seafoods we can't wait to try!  Don't pass this up for a date night or fun night out with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Food was perfection. Steak, whipped potatoes and carbonara pasta were all perfect. Among some of the best food I've had. Staff was wonderful and attentive. Only negative about the experience is to echo the reviews below about the seating. We were seated very close to our neighbors who were loud and obnoxious and it did taint an otherwise perfect dinner for our anniversary."}
{"text":"Top notch service and food!  We went here for our anniversary and our waitress made it one of the most memorable times ever!  I would have to say the staff takes this restaurant over the top. Get the fillet, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner with friends that came in from out of town. The location is great and the food was awesome. We pulled up and valet rushed right out to take the car, walked in and got a warm welcome. The checked our coats and walked us to our table that had a reserved sign on it. (That's a great touch to make people feel like their reservation is special) I kicked it off with a half dozen raw oysters and a Cesar salad. The Oysters are perfect and the salad was great with just enough dressing and of course i added anchovies. I select a special, it was a massive bone in ribeye cooked to absolute perfection (mer-rare push) we shared potato's au gratin, spicy green beans and Brussels sprouts! All the sides are enough to share and prepared with such flavor. This is a great spot and I can't wait to go back and try the sea food next."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place so much more as I have heard so many great things about it.  LOUD!  Extremely loud!  The table of 8 behind us were literally screaming at each other during their conversation.  It could have been because the round table is too large in diameter for them to effectively hear each other or that was their personality.  Most likely a combination of both as one in the group chose to use very colorful language at times.  It doesn't need to be quiet like mass, but it does't need to be as noisy as horse track either.  Also, they need to control inappropriate language used by their guests.  Meal started with calamari which was as average as any other place in the area.   Onion soup was awesome as was the tomato and mozzarella salad.  My wife had the shrimp for her entree and it was great.  I have the CAB prime, NY strip and it was okay.  Good crust, but lacked flavor.  Cauliflower au gratin was fantastic.  I look forward to trying Red again in the future, but probably won't go out of my way to do so.  At $250 for 2 (including tip) the whole experience should have been better."}
{"text":"Had the Ribeye. Probably the best steak I've ever had. It was perfection. The wedge and tots were okay but nothing special. Dessert donuts were great. I highly recommend them. Good service. A little noisy. Very expensive. Not the kind of place you'd go often because of the price but I'm glad I went and would go again."}
{"text":"Aside from the serious draft coming into the restaurant, Red the Steakhouse has all the physical trappings of fine dining. Nicely appointed dining room, impressive library of wine, etc. Unfortunately, beyond the atmosphere is a lackluster experience. My only caveats to this review are 1. It was restaurant week (though I feel strongly restaurants should prepare accordingly) and 2. I didn't voice my concerns at the time given my stellar company and conversation. Regardless, we waiting 45 minutes for our first course, were not offered a single drink refill (aside from water from the attentive water person) and, in general, each starter and entrée arrived on the cold side and/or overdone, with the exception of my side salad which was obviously supposed to be cold. What it was not supposed to be was so drenched in dressing that I could've wrung it out and produced an entire bottle. The fish of the day was overdone and tough, which is a word I don't think I've ever used to describe fish. And though our server was pleasant enough, his laughter over the \"hilarious\" \"mess in the kitchen\" was unprofessional and inappropriate given our wait time. With so many wonderful steak houses in Pittsburgh, I'll pass on this one. For what it's worth, my favorite color is red!"}
{"text":"Like usual, simply the best steak in Cleveland.  The 40 day dry aged ribeye was simply amazing. Tonight the service wasn't quite up to par but that happens.  The cauliflower gratin had a good taste, not sure what seasoning but it was great."}
{"text":"Quite simply, this is a solid addition to the Pittsburgh steakhouse and upscale dining scene.    It's a grown-up restaurant with a stylish yet not so stuffy ambience that exudes all the characteristics of what a great dining experience should be...and then delivers on truly delicious foods served in \"big boy\" portions with friendly and efficient service.    The restaurant serves an ample selection of meat, seafood, and pasta options along with some incredibly delicious sides - best shared at the table.  Not to be forgotten are the terrific array of salads that certainly should be the start of any meal at the restaurant.    All told, Red certainly joins the ranks as a go-to stop for business dinners and/or special occasions.    Another great Pittsburgh spot!  Put this place on your list for your next dinner night out!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice now, and it's the BEST steak house in Pittsburgh.  The side dishes are really good and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"This was a great place, sat at bar since alone and was well taken care of by Nicole and Zach, food perfect, drinks perfect all in all great dinner"}
{"text":"Most amazing dinner ever. I got the lobster and my husband for a big fat juicy delicious steak. We shared two side dishes the gnocchi with port wine and the asparagus. The gnocchi was amazing.   We decided to order the lava cake for dessert and it was awesome as well.   My only complaint would be bums were coming up to our outside table and asking for money!  The serve was great"}
{"text":"I had higher expectations based on their reputation. The foods very rich, but falls short for their price point.  The service was sub-par. The general manager looks all of 25 (maybe). His inexperience shows in how the staff was trained, which I assume was not very well.  There are too many new restaurants in Pittsburgh to try this one again any time soon."}
{"text":"Wait Staff is beyond nice! Wait time on food is very long!  I'm taking 1 star away for being so incredibly overpriced for how small the steaks are. It was almost $200 for 2 people.  A bowl of noodles was almost $30... Come on... At these prices I should have been wowed with flavor and portion, but I wasn't."}
{"text":"This is a treat. Expensive but totally worth it.  Love the food steak is out of this world I've been here a few times and every time I leave I'm just in awe.  I can't wait to go back there again soon."}
{"text":"Very good.  Service was fantastic and the food was wonderful."}
{"text":"Red is the special place I always like to take my Cleveland Family for dinner when ever I visit. We always go to the one in Beachwood, but on this visit my daughter-in-law made a  reservation to the newest one in downtown.  Our reservation was made for 5:30 because my 5 year old granddaughter was dining with us. But as life will happen getting to the restaurant was bit of a challenge as there was an event at the near by stadium.  It was clear we were not going to make the 5;30 time so we called and were told not to worry our table would be held. We managed to get there by 6:00 p.m. I always appreciate this kind of courtesy!. Plus they have valet parking.  The decor is very similar to the original Beachwood spot. Sleek, understated with comfortable banquettes and booths, stylish chairs and tables. Dark wood, black upholstery, white and of course red accents and mirrors create a very inviting environment to break bread in. The bread, in this case very good rolls, are accompanied by both butter and Parmesan and an olive oil mixture for dipping or spreading as you so choose.  Our waitstaff was professional and responsive with out being intrusive. That is an art.  To start: My daughter-in-law ordered the tomato mozzarella salad, I shared a very nicely prepared but not over the top Caesar salad and 6 small but very fresh and tasty west coast oysters, plus buttered spaghetti for my granddaughter.  I ordered the fillet, my son the rib eye and my daughter-in-law the king crab legs. We choice a sweet potato dish, creamed spinach and tater tots to share as sides.  Everything was perfectly prepared and perfectly present. Yet it just missed the mark of the Beachwood Red's. My steak like the salad was good but not great and the sides had a slightly synthetic taste.  Proportions are generous. We took most of the sides and parts of the steaks home.  If you are in downtown Cleveland Red is good. I'll let you know next if the Beachwood Red is still as great as it was on my last visit."}
{"text":"Red is among the best steak houses I've been to, and perhaps it is THE best. Not only was the meat perfectly cooked and aged, but the \"from scratch\" sauces and sides were unbelievable.  We had roasted cauliflower flavored with pine nuts and raisins (it tasted better than it sounded). The asparagus was peeled and lightly cooked, and the baked potato came with homemade chive butter and bacon bits that puts others to shame. The best part of the meal was the cucumber and basil cocktail,  which was light and tasty.  Red is a MUST in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The worst Steak House I have ever? been? The Scallops? for $ 40 tasted like shit and pepper and I could not even  finish them ....pepper only I am from NYC paying $40 for 4 Scalollops Please come and visit NYC..."}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week. Like most, we rely on restaurant week to try out nice local restaurants and gauge if we will ever come back. Our experience here was so-so.  The food was good. We expected top quality steak given the ratings and price and it was very good. The lone choice for the restaurant week steak was filet medallions. They didn't ask me what temperature I wanted the steak. I normally prefer medium rare but they came back medium. Still, the quality was very good, although not my temperature of choice.  The service unfortunately was the worst part of our dining experience and likely the reason we will not come back and choose other options when we feel like spending money on a nice evening. When it came time to order our drinks, my wife asked for a virgin drink (she was pregnant), to which the waitress replied, \"we don't have any virgin drinks\". I mean I understand if they really don't have virgin cocktails but she should have responded nicer and maybe recommended something or asked my wife what juice she likes. I then told the waitress that I would like a cab, knowing there was many options, I was expecting a recommendation of some sort. She quickly replied \"house cab, sounds good\", then turned around and swiftly walked away. Very odd and maybe I can chalk it up to her not realizing I wanted a good cab recommendation and was willing to pay for a nice glass of wine. At this point we had the feeling like because we we're ordering from the restaurant week menu, we we're not wanted or looked like we had no money to spend.   Our deserts were brought out and our waitress didn't ask us if we wanted any coffee or additional drinks. My wife had to flag her down Midway through desert to ask for coffee.  She then forgot to bring the coffee until after she gave us our check. She comped the coffee  which I guess was a nice gesture.  All in all, Red Steakhouse seems pretty pricey when it isn't restaurant week. We love to eat out and aren't afraid to pay for it. It was underwhelming when it came to service, which is a big deal breaker for us and why we won't be back."}
{"text":"i felt rushed being here.  granted, it was a saturday night and quite busy, but there were also times in which our server didnt check on us for extended periods.    it was very noisy as well.  i could not have a good conversation with my girlfriend because of it and it was somewhat frustrating.  the environment was on par with the area; trendy, nice color around the establishment.  i did find the food good.  steak was tasty as well as the sides...although the ordering of wine was clunky and our server mixed up my wine choice.  overall i think its an average place...perhaps ill give it another shot in a few months."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst \"high end\" steakhouse I've ever been to. The management shows through not only the food but experience. I came in when it was very cold outside, thinking to be welcomed into a warm space. Not to be had. They had space heaters throughout the restaurant, and when we asked our server she stated it never got any warmer then it was currently in the building. I had to keep my jacket on. When eating upwards of a $100 meal you most definitely want to feel comfortable and welcomed, but I felt neither. The food was deplorable, ROCK hard bread, fishy slimy salad and luke warm main course( see pictures).Please don't waste your time here, there are plenty of other restaurants that would love to have you that offer much better in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Went to Red on a busy night during the PINK concert. Despite all the reviews claiming it's too cold, ambiance is too austere, service is slow, etc. we did not really have very much of that, but we had our own issues at Red. I guess they were slammed from 5 pm until 7:30 pm with PINK concert goers. Our reservation was for 7:30 and the place was still full at that time, so we were seated in the bar area. Well that was not going over very well. The bar was very loud, rap music blaring out of the speakers and far too much movement about, for what I thought was going to be a nice dinner in an upscale steakhouse. And oh yes it was a bit cold in there despite window heaters along the booths. Kindly after 5 minutes of being seated, when a banquette opened up in the main dining room we were graciously asked if we wanted to move and we surely accepted. Very nice recovery to a very concerning start. We were met with 'team' service immediately after seating and our water order was taken. Within several minutes of that our drink order was taken. The menu was explained and any questions were answered. No sign of slow service here tonight despite how busy they were.  Bread service came next and that was a real disappointment. This bread was over baked, or reheated till burnt in places. It was very hard, dry and tasteless. Usually bread is a great start with a drink in hand but not this time. The bread supplier should to be replaced or the people who do the bread in the back. The bread came with some multiple flavors of grated and roasted parmesan cheese and olive oil which was not bad in fact the olive oil was good even if you are not a parmesan cheese fan.  Orders: Tomahawk Ribeye Medium; Prime New York Strip Med Rare; Prime Filet Mignon Medium, Oscar Style.  Sides: Cesar Salad; Mushrooms; Cauliflower Gratin; French Onion Soup. Wine and cocktails.  Steaks were wonderful, flavorful pieces of meat, done perfectly to order and nicely seasoned. The Oscar presentation was excellent and included Asparagus, Béarnaise Sauce and ¼ lb of king crab.  Cocktails were perfectly made and the wine selection was certainly sufficient with adequate varying selections by the glass.  Now where are the issues. Well the sides, soups and salads could improve for the most part. The French Onion soup presentation was great, but left something to be desired on the overall composition and flavor. The Mushrooms were way over done and were dry and tasteless. The Cesar Salad, well I asked for Anchovies but I did not expect finely chopped or mashed anchovies. The salad did not have great anchovy filets that I could enjoy. I did not find the anchovies to be of a high quality either. Fresh I did not expect, caned or jarred filets would be okay. Also the salad was over peppered to extreme. Usually I like to request the pepper grinder and have it ground to my taste. No grinder this time.  Minus the negatives, the dressing was pretty good, but I could not finish. The cauliflower gratin was well liked and was a hit.  Oh, on the decor which some people complain about, I don't like stuff everywhere distracting from company and food, and that was Red. I liked the pleasant neutrals and sedate nature of the dining room.  When you read this you can draw your own overall assessment based on this one experience. Because at a 'fine dining' steakhouse there are many factors making up the overall assessment I'll break them out. Mine would be between 3.5 and 4 overall. The steaks are a 4, the services was a 4.5, the sides were 2.5 to 3 except cauliflower was a 4. Wine selection 3.5 -4 depending on your expectations.   Because there was much on the upside of the mains, drinks and service and because they worked hard to give us a great experience I will assess the overall experience at a 4."}
{"text":"Service excellent!!!   Steak was very good, tuna was very plain and slightly warm, I asked for cold tuna, unfortunately it was slightly warm...  We ordered half pound of crab, smallest portion I have seen in a long time.  The bread that came out was not warm...  I think the experience was nice not great, the food was a 7, the steak was honestly a 8.5 was very good...  The Birthday desert was very good."}
{"text":"Red The Steakhouse, surprise, is an upscale steakhouse. It's located in beautifully remodeled space on the first floor of the Steel Building, space previously occupied by a number of horrible, forgettable restaurants. It's Steakhouse classic in terms of decor, menu, wine list, and high prices. The execution is very good and it, therefore, deserves to be ranked among the best Pittsburgh steakhouses, but there's nothing to meaningfully distinguish it from the others. Our dinner last night was excellent, consisting of a shared 8 ounce filet (the smallest available), shared tomato salad, and shared mac and cheese. We also had a bottle of red Bordeaux from the extensive wine list. Service was slightly disappointing, as we were served the regular mac and cheese, not the lobster version we ordered and the server made us wait a long time for the bill. Another annoyance was the valet parking, which costs $14, but nowhere is that disclosed until the valet knocks on your window as you are driving away, having received a much smaller cash tip. So, we can add another good upscale steakhouse to the downtown dining options. Great!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many nice things about this place that i was really looking forward to dining at this super upscale, romantic restaurant. Well, maybe I went on the wrong day because we sat next to a table of drunk women who were extremely loud and obnoxious who had no regard for other patrons! These women were a sip away from standing on their chairs.  The other tables surrounding these group of women, including my table were literally yelling to the people sitting across from us. The food was good, the wine was good but the atmosphere was nothing I imagined. With the amount of money you spend there to have a nice evening, I was disappointed. I would recommend going on a weekday if you're looking for something nice as opposed to the rodeo on the weekends."}
{"text":"Amazing cream corn! Very good lemon garlic shrimp. Surprisingly tender veal chop parm. Excellent drink picked by my waiter. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"This steakhouse is top notch.  Great food, great service, great ambiance.  Started with the onion soup.  Rich in flavor and not overtly salty.  Had the prime filet for an entree.  It was cooked to perfection on the inside with a nice sear on both sides to add that perfect steak doneness.  Had a side of mashed potatoes with gravy, gravy came on the side so my dinner guest didn't have to worry about gravy.  The potatoes and gravy were pretty damn good.  The waitress suggested the doughnuts, closer to beignets, which were awesome. Came with chocolate, raspberry and caramel dipping sauces.  The waitress was friendly and very attentive.  This place is a must if I'm Cleveland.  It's about a 20 minute drive from downtown and worth the drive.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"First time in Cleveland. What an amazing meal. My steak was cooked to perfection. Would recomend Red to anyone."}
{"text":"My first review still holds, but Red has fixed several of my complaints.   This last visit was superb.   The service was attentive and helpful.   The food was on point.   The wine list is impressive.   And the 40 day aged ribeye? Well, go big or go home.   Well done, Red. Thanks for bringing your rare game to pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This was the most expensive two-person meal I have ever had.  The steaks were good, but you could easily find a meal of comparable quality around town at many places for half the price.  Also, the atmosphere was disappointing.  While the lighting was good, it was very loud with tables grouped closely together.  Dare I say it--I was reminded of the \"cafeteria\" sound of the Cheesecake Factory!  Lastly, it's worth mentioning that getting to Red in a car was a nightmare.  I passed the valet parking on the wrong side of the street, but on account of the Indians game (and probably other stuff) going on downtown on Friday night, it took me at least 20 minutes to get back there.  Though it was a slight consolation that I got some of the $18 valet fee back when I provided my receipt to the parking guys.  My advice: if you want to go somewhere upscale, there are plenty of places in Tremont. Even if you are going to a place that is somewhat pricey (like Dante or Fahrenheit) you will still save money (over Red) and have comparable food with a better experience."}
{"text":"Best steak I've had in all my years of traveling for business. David H was also an outstanding knowledgable server"}
{"text":"And we ate like kings...  I was lucky enough to come here for a work dinner recently and was able to enjoy my meal (and much of the menu) without worrying about paying for the check. Our meals were delicious and the service was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is definitely a little uppity but more than anything I would say classy and modern with white, black and red decor.   But back to the food.. We had a big group and ordered lots of appetizers and sides. My favorite were the calamari and the mac and cheese. Stuffed peppers were also delicious, their marinara is perfectly sweet and spicy. I recommend the brussels sprouts or green beans over the asparagus (it was just a little too thick and soft for me.) I ordered the smaller filet portion topped with blue cheese and still took some home. To be honest, it was almost better heated up the next day.   The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because our bill ended up being so high with such a large group which is understandable but the majority of the cost was glasses of wine. With most of us not realizing we were all ordering the same kinds we wish our server would have given us a heads up so we could get bottles. And I think it's a little awkward all the menu prices end in $.9"}
{"text":"Wow.  It just doesn't get any better than this.  Classic steakhouse dishes with excellent service.  I had the ribeye with horsradish sauce--outstanding--probably the best steak I ever ate.  It had great flavor on its own, but the horseradish made it even better.  They have a great selection of side dishes to accompany your steak.  My wife had a shrimp cocktail appetizer and the scallops special, both were wonderful  And make sure you try a dessert and coffee drink to make the evening complete.  Their homemade doughnuts were great.  Amanda, our server, took great care of us.  It was my wife's birthday and I wanted everything to be special.  Yes, it is expensive, but they deliver the value: great service, great ingredients, expert preparation, and a modern, comfortable atmosphere.  For a special occasion dinner, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"As compared to competitors like the woeful Morton's and over hyped Hyde Park, Red towers over them with better quality steak and a more inspired menu. The only choice in Cleveland for steak, period. I have been many times and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Best ribeye I have had in awhile. Dined here twice in the last few months for special occasions. The wait staff is very professional and knows how everything is prepared on their menu. I recommend ordering the powdered donuts for dessert."}
{"text":"Probably the best steak I've had in Cleveland. Good thing because the a-la-carte sides are uninspiring. I've been to Red three times and all three times have tried a different side. The only reason I'm not giving Red 5 stars is because of the sides. They're not alone though. I don't know why restaurants have such a hard time complimenting steaks, but they do. I will say the donuts that they offer for dessert are very good!"}
{"text":"This gets 3/5 stars in my book admittedly because I'm very critical of steakhouses, especially ones that are top dollar. Also, I felt the sides (which were delicious) actually outshines my steak.  The steak (ribeye) itself actually had good marbling. However it did lack in seasoning, and for the price I paid I could have gotten an aged bone-in ribeye from Bones (which by comparison blew this one out of the water) or a cognac peppercorn crusted filet from Hals On Old Ivey (check out these two if you ever frequent Atlanta).  This steak was overpriced because it didn't hold a flame to those top two joints I mentioned above.   I will say the truffle mashed potatoes and sautéed garlic spinach were spectacular. I just think whoever got my steak order served me a bland steak that I could have cooked myself and had a better experience. To charge these prices I expect to be blown away and by comparison just didn't quite measure up. Ultimately the sides saved this review but it shouldn't be that way at a place that bills itself as a top steakhouse."}
{"text":"This is my second time going to Red. Delicious! You will pay a pretty penny for the food, but it's well worth it. The steak was a great and topped off with crab as well as a side of horseradish sauce. Get the mushrooms as well!"}
{"text":"We had plans to come to Cleveland for our \"mini moon\" after we got married this past weekend and put a lot of time and research into finding the best steakhouse in Cleveland to celebrate. We were not disappointed after having dinner here tonight. The waitress was friendly and personable. We ordered way too much food but everything was so good. The salad, steaks, and sides were amazing. The waitress even brought us out their house desert to celebrate. Perfect spot for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I must say this was an outstanding dinner. 5 star for sure. Started with our entrance. So inviting and welcoming. Started with shrimp cocktail that was excellent and plentiful. Calamari was very good. The NY Strip was the best I've had in a long time. Sides of sautéed spinach, mac & cheese, scalloped potatoes were perfect. Let's not forget the Jefferson Reserve bourbon to top off the meal! Service was excellent, front of house manager was excellent. They served up a birthday dish as well. Don't know what it was called but it was like the best round donut I've ever had.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Get the bone in Ribeye. Best steak I've ever had. Hands down. The meal and service were fantastic. Totally worth it if you're willing to pay for quality!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better steaks I have ever had. Service was fantastic, and every course was perfect. If you want a great steakhouse experience, you cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences that I have ever had at a restaurant.   We decided on Red for a friends 30th birthday party. We requested a private room for our group of 18 but were seated in the bar area where they pushed a bunch of tables together. This is how you honor our reservation?   Our first drink took 45 minutes to arrive. Food was ordered after 90 minutes. Wait staff stopped coming to our table and we began ordering from the bar. After two hours and not even a salad we had to begin canceling our food as it was closing in on 11pm. The manager was frantically doing what he could but it appeared as though there was no wait staff which as the manager was his fault.  In the end, we were brought about 1/3 of our order and the salads were warm-like they were sitting under the heat lamp. My ribeye was WAY overcooked. It probably sat under the heat lamp too long as well. The manager ended us comping us over 1000 dollars of food and drink in the end. However, the entire meal was ruined.   This place is nowhere near as refined as any of the other steakhouses around town. Stick to Capital Grille or Hyde Park and avoid this place."}
{"text":"The most amazing meal i have ever had, The sides were the most unique thing about the meal the snap peas with chilis were just heaven along with the cream corn. The baked potato was good but not as good as the mac and cheese. The steak was amazing perfect !  The drinks were perfect and they serve woodford reserve bourbon with their old fashion was fantastic.  Coffee service was delish.. I really liked this placed and so did my boyfriend so we will be back."}
{"text":"Crab cake - meaty but small - 4 stars. CAB Prime steak tartare - large chunks - 4 stars. CAB Prime filet mignons - cooked to our liking - 4 stars. Service - courteous and prompt - 4 stars. Drink - I forget what the alcoholic beverage was called, but we did not like the taste at all - 2 stars. Value - overpriced compared to better-tasting restaurants - 2 stars."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner last night at Red. Starting with the steak tartare, which I had never had, through the bread pudding for desert, we enjoyed each dish. We had three in our party and all selected the Prime C.A.B. ribeye. It was cooked perfectly-medium-and very juicy. The family style options were plenty to share. We had creamed spinach, whipped potatoes and four cheese mac and cheese and enjoyed all three. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. All-in-all, we had a great meal and will go back next time we want a delicious steak. The only area that needs some work is the valet. Although the guys were very nice, it's a little bit of a walk to get into the restaurant, which wasn't too fun on a freezing cold night. When we went to get the car, we had to wait around 20 minutes, also in the freezing cold. A little improvement in this area would be appreciated."}
{"text":"Was there with a party of 26. Staff was great. Food was great. Was most impressed when they brought out the main course for all 26 at the same time and everything was cooked perfectly. Definitely would recommend for a group. They have very good happy hour specials as well."}
{"text":"The place has a great look. The service by Brandon was great. He was very pleasant. The drinks were very good and not the usually watered down drinks we get now at most restaurants. The steaks were well flavored and very tender. The valet parking was $12 but well worth it. They give you a phone number to text when you are ready for the car. They give you a number for your car. You text them then they bring you the car with the heat turned on and the seats warmed. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The salmon was unquestionably the most delicious I have ever had, as was the asparagus. Outstanding, attentive service - did not try to up sell. The deserts were exquisite.  Extensive cocktail menu and wine list. I liked the interior and the ambiance. Well worth every penny you'll spend. Will revisit every time in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Beautiful space.  Great venue for a special occasion. The salmon was excellent.  Seared to perfection and superb quality of fish.  I loved the mashed potatoes and green beans.  The ceasar salad and the lava cake were average.  The coffee was horrible - watered down.  Overall this place knows how to prepare meat.  Parking can be difficult here and valet at E 4th maybe your most convenient option, I think with receipt the valet cost should be under 10$ but not sure.  The downtown location has great dining rooms on the second level and a rooftop deck.  I'd like to try the deck next time I'm downtown."}
{"text":"As a meat and potato gal I have tried pretty much every steak place in Ohio...and this is my favorite. I usually get a 6 oz. filet at steakhouses and have 1/2 left to take home. Here I got an 8 oz. filet and I finished every little bit. If I hadn't been in public I would have licked the plate. Perfect preparation and presentation! The sides (mac and cheese and salads) were really good and they were willing to split the salad so they get extra credit for that!"}
{"text":"had an incredible steak - everything about it was perfectly done. the wine list, sides and desserts were all great as well, but you come for the steak and you will be impressed."}
{"text":"Came here to have a few drinks and appetizers. When I walked into the restaurant I was greeted with a warm friendly smile from the hostess, she showed me to the bar where I ordered a drink from their expansive drink menu. The bartenders both were very friendly and made great drinks.  We ordered the crab cake appetizer, which was ok, I prefer my crab cakes prepared with lump crab meat, these seemed to be flavorful, but mostly filler. We also had the tuna poke and scalloped potatoes, both were very good.  The experience so far was good- then we go outside to get our cars from valet....... complete nightmare! First, it was very cold and windy outside, there were two couples ahead of us who had already been waiting 20+ minutes for their car. I happened to see my car right out in front of the restaurant, so I just asked for my key so I could just get my car myself....... cannot do, because they could not find the keys!!!! Finally one of the guys gets in a car and gets keys from another driver who was supposedly getting the original couples car.  And I had to pay $12.00 for this???!!!!   Because of this, I will be hesitant to return, when I am finished with dinner, I do not want to stand outside for 1/2 hour or more in freezing weather to wait for my car..... too much hassle"}
{"text":"First time to Cleveland and was looking for a steakhouse to take a client to. Red hit the mark perfectly! Steaks were perfect. Love the crust on the outside from the 800 degree broiler. Wait staff was extremely knowledgeable. I have to point out the sides. They were a highlight. Get the green beans if you go. Unreal with a little spice. They also had a special risotto with sausage and peppers. Absolutely phenomenal! Great experience all around."}
{"text":"Their steak is the best I've had outside of one big name NYC steakhouse, wine list has a good range of selections and they don't gouge you on the mark up, salad and sides were excellent, and the service was top notch - our glasses never got less than half full. Oh, and the donut hole desert was awesome! Easily one of the top restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Not up to par with other steakhouses due to: 1. Poor service and timing. Our waiter was great but kitchen timing is everything. Way too slow in our case. 1 hour until our salads arrived...  2. Lackluster Red House Salad. 1/5 stars. Ownership needs to reevaluate this \"house\" salad. 3. Steaks cooked accordingly but my Ribeye cut was poor in quality. Very little outer ring area which is the best part of a ribeye. It had the texture and tenderness of a New York Strip, so very little fat and dense.  4. Price they are charging for house salads and wines is ridiculous. This is not New York or Chicago!  Avoid. I recommend Johnnys Filet Mignon or Urban Farmer."}
{"text":"For a place that displays a price tag of a top U.S. restaurant my opinion is only one:  Overrated The menu options are of a dinning place with too many obvious options and not defined as a carefully studied by a chef. The setup is small and crowded Perhaps the fact that out waiter was awful helped on my dislike for the price vs service. Food served was ok."}
{"text":"Extra slow service! Is 2 hours standard for dinner here? The food was awesome, drinks were ok."}
{"text":"Best steak ever. Best service. Loved every bit of it. Worth the price to splurge. We'll be back sometime."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off and say this has been the number one worst restaurant experience I have ever had. I came into the restaurant to try out the restaurant week menu for lunch. I work in the steel building and figured it would be easy since Red is located in the building as well. Arrived at 12:10 and didn't leave until 2, and we didn't even get to taste our dessert in the restaurant.  After being blatantly ignored for about 20 minutes, our waitress finally came up and asked us our drink order and our food order. I had the stuffed peppers, sandwich of the day, and the donuts for dessert. The stuffed peppers came out in a timely fashion. The food came out (for me) on time, but my co-worker has to send her steak back because everything on the plate was cold. Once her replacement meal had come out, I was done eating. I looked around during this time and everyone who had come in AFTER us had their checks and finished their 3 courses. Once the waitress had come back to our table (another 30 minutes after the entrée had been sent back) I asked her what was taking so long and why our meal seemed to be taking double the time as other patrons. She scurried back to the kitchen and brought our leftovers and dessert bagged up and in to go containers. Not once did I ask for the dessert to be bagged up. When I brought it up to her she said it was because I \"was scaring her.\" Mind me, I am a small 22 year old who looks the opposite of intimidating.  To put a final stake in our graves, we looked at our bill to see we had been charged for the most expensive wine (which I had not ordered) and my co-workers \"complimentary drink\" was charged as well. I have never seen or heard of such bad service from such an upscale restaurant. I am severely disappointed considering I have heard such great things about the food and the establishment.  Be warned, this is not the place to spend your well earned money, especially if you're 22 and the waitress thinks you won't tip as well as an older couple  ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"To preface, we sat in the bar area. But, I doubt we will ever go back for the full dining experience. With that being said, the bartender, Kimberly, was fantastic. She was super friendly and attentive.   We started with a Makers on the rocks and a glass of red wine. My glass of Super Tuscan, while overpriced, was actually pretty decent.  We decided to order in courses and continue ordering if we enjoyed the preceding course. We started with the calamari. For $16, it was small. And chewy. And overall lacked flavor. It barely deserves 2 stars. Compared to the calamari served at comparable restaurants including the Capital Grille and McCormick & Schmicks, it was pathetic.   We then ordered the wedge salad and French onion soup. The wedge salad was slightly above average. I'd say the highlight was the pickled red onions (okay, but what does that really say about a salad when onions are the highlight?!). The French onion soup was incredibly bland. The broth was bland. The cheese was flavorless. I've had better French onion soup at Applebee's.   After those two courses, we decided to forego entrees. If they can't manage to cook calamari properly, I don't know that I trust them with a steak. For an \"upscale\" restaurant, our food experience was incredibly disappointing. We'll stick with places we know won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Had dinner there on Saturday with a gift card from my children at Christmas. Food was excellent but a little pricey."}
{"text":"The food- is good, it's not outstanding but it's good for a steakhouse. The service- awful Attention to detail- Our waitress opened 1 bottle of wine and left it out on a table for the room to basically serve themselves. Management- terrible.  There are plenty of great restaurants in Cleveland- don't take your chances at Red The Steakhouse. The follow up is just as bad. Excuse after excuse- and not even accurate. Total RIP-OFF"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service left much to be desired. We had made a reservation for 8:00. We arrived early, so we waited at the bar until our table was ready. In retrospect, remaining at the bar would have been the better option. The bartenders were friendly and provided efficient service. After we were seated at our table,  we had to wait 20-25 minutes before a manager noticed we had not been waited on. Our waitress didn't apologize for our wait (perhaps the manager didn't communicate that we had been waiting for a while) and gave only adequate service. She didn't ask us if we were celebrating anything special (we went out for an early Valentine's Day) and she didn't ask us if we had dined at Red before. She also brought out and charged us for bernaisse sauce that we hadn't ordered. The waitress didn't come around very frequently and the sauce issue wasn't a huge deal, so we just let it slide. In short, we were hoping for a special romantic evening at a new restaurant and were somewhat disappointed/left wishing we had gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been here before and the food was amazing. This last time (10/14/16) I ordered my filet medium rare and it came at medium well. I was too tired and hungry to send it back so I ate it. Usually I would tell them but I wanted to hurry and get out. I will go back and try it again but if it happens again, I will certainly tell them!"}
{"text":"The best piece of meat I've had in CLE so far! Came here with friends to celebrate my birthday, so I was definitely in a good mood to begin with. The delicious food and great service made me even more happy! They just recently opened this location, so everything is still new! I got the filet mignon, which was good, but I have to say I really liked my friend's bone-in ribeye better! It was super tender and juicy. I also tried another friend's porterhouse steak. It was also tender and well seasoned. After trying the different steaks with bones still in them, it made me think that I should start switching over from the filet mignon to other cuts of meat! The waiter was kind enough to explain the different cuts of meat etc, since many of us didn't know the differences. We shared appetizers and side dishes, since the proportions are big. We started off with calamari and tuna tartare which were good. I liked the sauce on the fried calamari, and I was extremely happy to see they drizzled it lightly on top. Some places tend to drench the food in sauce and ruin the dish. I liked the plantain chips with the tuna tartare, it gave the dish a nice crunch. For sides we shared the whipped truffle potatoes, which were wonderful. I am a potato lover, so we also got the tater tots which had a delicious mayo based sauce. We also got veggies- asparagus and the brussels sprouts...need to get our daily dose of vitamins of course! For the last side dish, we got the Mac n cheese- very indulgent but oh so yummy! I did get to try one pasta dish that a friend ordered, the linguini with clams. It was pretty good, but since I was in the mood for MEAT, I was happy with my steak! Overall it was a great dinner, the staff was wonderful and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I definitely have to come back when I get another hankering for meat!!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice wine options.... Excellent service!!! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that there seemed to be a lot of older gentleman with questionable looking women, by that I mean.. I don't think that they were wives or girlfriends!!! I have a friend who visited on a separate occasion and said she had noticed the same thing."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks, relaxed atmosphere and friendly service.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for  a business dinner or to celebrate a special occasion."}

Food/Drink: Steakhouse with Italian flair. This place is a boutique experience and is a must-do experience. Most of the choice-work can be attributed to Chef Peter Vauthy's vision. They have Certified Angus Prime selections which you will not find common in Pittsburgh and the steaks are cooked to perfection. The wine menu is extensive and the cocktail list has a Perennial Manhattan which is enough of a reason to visit.      Service: Again, Christina is a great hostess and sets the pace for a pleasant experience. The servers are new and the staff are getting acquainted to their new home, to be expected. The management team is around helping, and actively makes a table touch in a calm and welcoming way. They were busy when I dined there both times and everyone has composure which is what separates the try-hards from the titans in the service industry.   Overall: Buy the ticket, take the ride. It's worth the price and the service is impeccable. It's about getting what you pay for and Red's won't disappoint. It will soon be the new \"place\" in Dahhn-Tahhn ; )"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our 10th wedding anniversary. He requested a booth Which we did get. We started off with the shrimp appetizer which was great however everything went down hill from there. We both got steaks his a ribeye and mine a filet. My filet was over cooked and both of our steaks tasted burnt due to the excessive seasoning charred into the meat. My husband even said his would be better with steak sauce which he never uses. Our server would have known that if she would have checked on us. We also had   the asparagus and parmesan tater tots. The asparagus was peeled and it gave it a slimy texture the tater tots were more like chewy undercooked potato pancakes. We were seated next to the loudest most obnoxious table we couldn't even have a conversation unless we yelled at each other. Management was checking in on tables but the majority were large parties he in passing ask us how everything was but walked away before we could say anything. As for the service we expected more since the cost of our meal was expensive. Our server spent a lot of time at the table next to ours having a long conversation while we were ignored. After the meal we had there, dessert was not an option we just wanted to leave. This was not worth the money and we will not return."}
{"text":"Delicious NY strip. Tater tots: loved them.  Brussels sprout: nicely done.  I wish the bread was of those crusty, can't-stop-eating, freshly baked French bread type.    Good solid execution of known, traditional dishes.  This is not a thinking out of the box, creative kitchen crew; and there is nothing wrong with that. It was an enjoyable - though somewhat over-priced- experience. Analogous to Ruth's Chris:  solid and well executed known dishes, but over-Priced."}
{"text":"Expensive. Only had a drink at the bar. Cosmopolitan was $17 and Moscow mule $12. One bar tender seemed irritated we had a question. We didn't try any food but it was expensive."}
{"text":"The food is delicious however, they do not take allergies seriously! Be aware if you have an allergy!!! I specific told our waiter of my allergy...I did not say intolerance I said allergy. When my meal came out I questioned what looked like a sauce and they reassured me it was only olive oil. Well the waiter cane up and started talking to me about my allergy before leaving. He asked how quickly I would have a reaction, what the symptoms were and many more. I didn't think anything of it, I assumed he was trying to be more knowledge on the matter. Well, I got home and an hour later I was sick as a dog. Up all night into the next day in pain. For a restaurant of its caliber you would think they would train the staff better! This was the first and last time I will ever revisit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Simply amazing experience! My husband surprised me for my birthday and took me to Reds. We have children. I was told it's not very kid friendly, but our server was great with them. I would not take them back though. It's more of a parents nice night out kind of place. The dessert trio is a must try! Our steaks (filet and porterhouse) were fantastic. Typically my children add A1 sauce to their steaks, but didn't even ask for it this time. Valet parking was really good too. They give you a card. You can text them when you are about done and they warm your car up, if it's cold out. This particular night it was freezing so the warm car was much appreciated."}
{"text":"A tad on the expensive side, but when you take the first bite of your steak the price wont matter anymore because it was one of the best I ever tasted.  Like always, I never give 5 stars after 1 visit.  But definitely  has 5 star  potential."}
{"text":"Whereas I used to be a steak guy, I'd given up, preferring fish or pasta at a good steakhouse...just too hard to find a well cooked steak it seems.    A work dinner took me to Reds, and was told that this was good steak.  Holy cow, the NY Strip USDA medium-rare with horse radish sauce was absolutely spot on.  Best steak I've ever had.    It's not cheap at $50-ish for the steak alone, but so, so good."}
{"text":"Just left Red had the porterhouse steak with Mac & cheese. Very good service will be back"}
{"text":"The food was good. But I feel that it was rather expensive for what it was. I've been to chain restaurants with the same quality food. Definitely not a $40 steak. I've had $10 steaks that were better quality. The steak came by itself then you had to add $15+ sides. The service was rather slow. Although they did get us in without reservation within 10min of our party of 4 arriving."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week last night and really enjoyed the menu. Recommend the mussels. Great portion. You get your money worth with the Atmosphere, Service, and Food. Filet Medallions were seared and seasoned perfectly.   Also, great bathrooms. Very upscale"}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience! Great apps, nice wine selection, good size portions & mouth watering steaks. I would definitely recommended and return on my next visit to town."}
{"text":"Reading all these glowing reviews leaves me wondering if there's another Red in downtown Cleveland...at the same address. Went here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday evening and was disappointed to be seated in a booth by the bar. We're spending over $200 on a meal and get seated basically at a bar? Um, not ok. The four of us shared the calamari appetizer which was excellent. For entrees we each got steaks, and ordered two sides to share-the sautéed spinach and truffled mashed potatoes. Spinach was basically something I could have whipped up in 10 minutes at home with a bag of spinach, garlic and some EVOO. Was enough for one person. Mashed potatoes were just ok. I've had much better. Steak was rather bland for a reputable steakhouse. Service was decent. My husband and I agreed that the overall meal was disappointing and didn't compare to Red in Beachwood. Will not return."}
{"text":"We sat outside on a Friday and it was a perfect night, the Indians were playing so there was good people watching. Our waiter was very good. He was knowledgeable buy not pushy. We had the beef tartare and raw oysters to start. Both were very fresh and very clean tasting. We then had some king crab, some prime new York strip, creamed spinach, sautéed shrooms, and \"tater tots\", which are just deep fried reconstructed baked potatoes. We had zero complaints. Everything was very fresh. The steak was perfect. It has classic steakhouse quality but some fun modern updates. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Two things keep this from being five stars for me. First and foremost, they wet age their steaks, and I'm a dry aging fan all the way. Second, it's staggeringly expensive, but I guess that's part of their schtick. Aside from those things, Red pretty much nails it from a steakhouse experience perspective. It's elegant and modern with impeccable sides and service. The options for those not fond of the bovine menu are good too. If they dry aged, it would be my favorite steakhouse in town."}
{"text":"Red proved to be my favorite color. My wife and I enjoyed Cleveland Restaurant Week here on a snowy Saturday evening, and the abysmal Cleveland roads proved to be no obstacle to our evening out. I had a certified Angus filet mignon, and Gail enjoyed the salmon off the prefix menu. We both chose the Red salad. Our food, service and dining experience was nothing short of fabulous. The desert doughnuts rocked out with a fine double espresso. I was amazed by the amount of traffic on 4th Street. Cleveland truly rocks!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Red The Steakhouse, and overall it was a good experience. I've heard great things about Red, and have visited Steakhouses in Chicago that are world class. So suffice it to say that I was looking forward to the evening.  The young ladies at the host stand when we arrived must have been paid not to smile because they appeared disinterested and it felt like we were imposing upon their conversation. Not a good first impression.  Our waiter was prompt and friendly, and eager to please all night long. We were sitting in the bar area, and the female bartender seemed very engaged and eager to help her customers.  We got the calamari and it was alright. Not great. It had a burnt aftertaste, which was odd. Salt helped. Dinner ranged from meatballs and pasta, to Poke, to a dry aged steak. The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare, but the pepper crust was also a little burned.  Overall it was a nice evening. Not the wonderful experience I had been told it was going to be, but certainly if I'm downtown again and want more than a burger, I'll come here. Just probably won't make a special trip in for Red, considering all the other great options in the area."}
{"text":"This place was superb!  It was recommended by locals (and clearly fellow Yelpers) and did not disappoint.  The parmesan/oil dip (for the bread) is outstanding! It's different than your standard butter or oil and it's a standout before you even start eating.  Appetizer: We started with the Tuna Tartare which was a larger portion than usual! It was chopped up into finer pieces and served with a few plaintain chips across the top rather than a few big chunks. I think I prefer it this way.  Entree: The fish of the day was sold out, but the replacement was scallops and they were DELICIOUS.  The chef prepared them with some fingerling potatoes and some olive oil, but whatever it was had so much flavor. And there were so many scallops. I would get this every time I went to dinner if I could.  My husband had the CAB Prime NY Strip because he \"had\" to try it. And while I know he loved it, I'm still not convinced the whole CAB, USDA, CAB Prime, isn't some gimmick to make you pay more.  Side: Green beans-- these were so good. The pancetta and pine nuts matched perfectly. I would totally get these again.  If I lived in Cleveland, I would come back here again and again."}
{"text":"I frequent Reds a lot being a Cavs season ticket holder. I will admit the food is excellent. We've always had great meals. My issue is the staff seems to be arrogant. Our issue has never been the food quality it's just staffing issues."}
{"text":"Red came highly recommended - even by owners of competing restaurants.  I was looking forward to dining at the downtown location and did so yesterday, December 3rd.  I ordered the prime ribeye, a steak I also regularly order at XO, Morton's and Ken Stewarts.  The first problem was that the cut was almost the exact same as the \"problem cuts\"  XO and others have been receiving lately from Stockyard and Blue Ribbon.  They are thick, mealy and tasteless.  That's not Red's fault, and they did a very good job of adding flavor with herbs and salt.  They, along with the others, need to demand better quality when customers are paying nearly $50 for a steak.  So I chalk this up to a supplier problem.  I also ordered the mac and cheese side (about $10) which was a disappointment.  On the plus side it was a very large portion.  Other than that there's very little cheese, and it floats in a startlingly strong garlic sauce.  It could benefit from a little less garlic and a little more cheese.  The servers were cheerful and attentive.  The owner of this restaurant also owns the excellent \"Moxie\" and surely knows how to make great food.  It's possible I caught these guys on a bad day.  If I go back and experience better, I'll amend this review.  (This review was originally posted for the Beachwood location, and was moved to the correct location 12/23/13)."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience at Red! Decided to take advantage of Pittsburgh Restaurant Week for a friends birthday. We had no trouble getting a reservation despite having a party of 6.   This was an especially great deal because of Restaurant Week. To put it into perspective, a filet on the menu is normally $48, while our 3 course menu was $35.   We ordered some drinks and a bottle of wine and then proceeded to select our courses. We all got the filet as our main course, and boy are we glad we did! They cut like butter and were delicious as ever. There are several options for upgrades, such as lobster Mac and cheese or french onion soup.   The only little hang up came with our dessert course. The ran out of the donuts, which most of us ordered, but the GM came over (and knowing that we were celebrating a birthday) offered to treat us to another round of drinks as well as an assortment of desserts. For a young guy, he totally had it together. Our waitress and her assistant were also phenomenal."}
{"text":"So so so good. Definitely worth the money. We had a surf and turf with filet and crab, and also a bone in ribeye. Everything cooked perfectly. Honestly the best steaks both of us had. They also celebrated my SO's bday by writing in chocolate happy birthday on a surprise desert. Everything was perfect. Cocktails also tasty and very fresh. Service very nice, gave good recommendations, and just the right amount of space to enjoy our food and each other."}
{"text":"Great steak house.  Everything perfect. One complaiint I informed the manger that calling their steak MIYAZAKI JAPENESE KOBE is misleading. MIYAZAKI is a region in Japan where waygu \"Japenese cow\" are raised.  So is Kobe which is another region where the cattle is raised.  So to say it is Miyazaki and Kobe at the same time makes no sense.  It is from one region or the other not both.  The manger apprarently either did not understand this and change the menu to read Miyazaki Waygu or they want the name Kobe their beccause it better known.  It is misleading to use Kobe name though.  Its like calling sparkiling wine made in California Champagne."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food here is absolutely incredible. There are two reasons I am giving them a 3 stars. First is the service was barely mediocre, absolutely nothing special, but not terrible either. The second reason for 3 stars is the disgusting bathroom. Trash on the floor, dirty toilets and stalls, dirty sink and counters, and a bad smell. The Q had cleaner bathrooms than thus place."}
{"text":"Everything was phenomenal from the top down. Service, food, and atmosphere were all exceptional. We will definitely be back. Check out the dessert specials! Out of this world"}
{"text":"An excellent steakhouse in a scenic and lively part of Cleveland. My father and I ordered salads, I had the Mediterranean and he had the cranberry walnut. Both were light and flavorful and complimented the steaks very well. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and were delicious. We also split the gnocchi, which I found to be a great side starch for the steak. We had a couple beers and then went over to catch a ball game.great experience great service."}
{"text":"The filet was dry and just ok. The service was extremely poor. The waiter didn't even hear anything we said to him he was just interested in up selling the menu. It took forever just to receive a cocktail and a glass of wine. We were really looking forward to coming here but it's just sad they can't hire better waiters at a high-end place like this. Not to mentioned we told them it was a birthday when we made the reservation when we came in and we let the waiter know additionally and he still forgot to bring it out and said he said he was never relayed the information even though we told the waiter to his face but he probably wasn't listening. Customer service was extremely lacking. The bone-in rib eye was delicious though."}
{"text":"Well worth the pricey bill. I dined alone on a recent business trip and enjoyed the entire experience, from the friendly greeting to the perfectly-attentive wait staff. The manager came over to introduce himself and ensure that I was having my needs met. I absolutely was. First, I treated myself to a lovely $26 glass of wine (Frank Cab). They brought me delicious bread and olive oil to enjoy before I started my meal with a fabulous Caesar salad. It was perfect. I then had the filet encrusted with blue cheese and it was cooked to perfection. I finished with a beautiful dessert.  My bill was $99 before tax and tip.  This is an expensive restaurant but if you are looking for a wonderful steakhouse, I highly recommend this."}
{"text":"Red downtown is totally different experience than Red on Richmond Rd. The atmosphere is upbeat with lots of open doors and fresh air. The bar is large but not easy to navigate when crowded. We had the bone in ribeye and it was average at best. The ribeye was sliced before brining it to the table resulting in a dry, inconsistently cooked piece of meat with 0 char. I wish I sent it back. The corn side was a let down but the mushrooms were quite tasty. The rooftop deck is nice on a temperate night but the view is of a parking lot. I think I will stick to the Richmond Rd location where my meals are always good"}
{"text":"I liked the place, but 5 stars it ain't.  First off, why do you have two tiers of steaks?  Why not serve ONLY USDA prime beef?  Secondly, who the fuck do you think you are charging me $11 for a house salad and $14 for a side of mushrooms?"}
{"text":"An amazing steak house in downtown Cleveland. Jeff our waiter was very informative and provided excellent service. I tried the bone-in rib eye that was off menu. Cooked to perfection with amazing taste and melt in your mouth fat. A must try steak house!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary. The seating area is kind of tight so that was not what i expected, but not a big deal. The party next to us was obnoxious but actually apologized half way through the meal for being too loud.  I realize this is a steak house but my favorite thing about it was not the steak. It was the truffle whipped mashed potatoes and the banana cream parfait.  I had the donuts dessert too (I'm a big dessert person!)  But the parfait was simpley amazing. My husband thought so too, and he is not a dessert person.   I do have to say i was a little sad they didn't acknowledge our anniversary. After  the meal i asked about it because this seemed like  place that would help you celebrate those special occasions.  I brought it up very casually to the hostess (not trying to get anything out of it, just expressing some dissapointment) and the manager came right away and asked us what we he could do for us. So we told him we loved the banana cream parfait. He had the chef make us a double order of it to go and threw in a cheesecake as well. That cheesecake was also amazing. We appreciated that gesture. And also want to say that the pastry chef here is amazing.    We used the valet for parking since we were at the downtown location and i think the guy didn't give us change. We were going  to tip, but he just assumed it was  all his. That was annoying to me so watch out for the valet crew...."}
{"text":"Had my girlfriends birthday dinner here. Very elegant and energetic environment. Decided to come here from previous reviews. Chef Michael Symon has this listed in his top 5 favs in Cleveland. Service was superb and food was over the top. Complimentary desert from the chef as well. Donut holes were great with the raspberry sauce."}
{"text":"Well when your first experience is to have drinks and they're weak okay so we switched to wine. But I ordered a loaded baked potato to go. Specifically asked how it came as I wanted a quick easy dinner when I got home. First, no cheese. Second had asked for extra sour cream and got a tiny container to open. The potato was way over cooked with no toppings and a bit of bacon and butter to I guess too myself? No cheese. $11 for a baked potato and I had to make it for myself? Capital grille has one for half the price and way more bacon and sour cream and actually adds the cheese. The waitress also said they put on chives. No chives no cheese. I've had better at Denny's  I can only imagine how the steak will be"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a lovely dining experience at Red. The service was wonderful and the drinks were excellent. The restaurant is spacious and cleanly decorated to really give an open and elegant feel. The appetizers were great and the steak was to die for! So why not 5 stars? The presentation of the steak was less than perfect. We share everything and knowing this the server brought out our steak cut in half and on two plates, which was very nice; however, it came with nothing else. It just was not as pretty and appetizing looking as it sounded on the menu. But it tasted absolute perfection!!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Sweetest Day date with my girlfriend. The ambiance was romantic, our reservations were acknowledged, the staff was very inviting and kind, and the food...amazing.   Our waiter was very friendly, knowledgeable, patient, and fun. The wine list was impressive, the portion sizes of the food were a lot more than I expected, and everything was delicious.   My steak was cooked perfectly, my date's salmon was cooked perfectly, and the waiter's suggestion for the dessert--the donuts--were an amazing choice. My girlfriend cannot stop thinking about those donuts.  I would definitely recommend RED. I have been to similar restaurants with similar quality of staff and food. RED was a little easier on the wallet, which was surprising to me, but I am glad because I will be returning."}
{"text":"I made my boss take me here after he lost a bet. The steak was great, the wine was better. This steakhouse is in my top three in Cleveland. I'm a huge dessert gal though and I do have to say their dessert isn't worth ordering. The medium rare filet was cooked perfectly. I think they must just undertook the temp because normally my mid rare is closer to medium but this was closer to rare, which is perfect for me. Recommend reservations for peak hours. Also: went to a private party here, you can't play your own music which is obnoxious and the liquor is limited because they don't have a full bar upstairs."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and someone told me how great the food was here. I was dying for a great steak. I went in and found out I was too early for then dinner menu, however the young lady went into the back and then came back and said the chef would be glad to make me a steak. The food here does not disappoint but the service was tremendous. Great place to have a great steak and a drink while in Pittsburgh. High on my list of favorites!"}
{"text":"Red Rooftop is up and running. Great views overlooking Prospect. Looks right across the Q and would be a prime spot for the fireworks post tribe games. Only drinks are available no food upstairs. Excellent addition to one of my favorite restaurants in downtown CLE."}
{"text":"Not cheap, but very good food! My husband & I split a larger steak & a side & it was plenty.  The steak was cooked perfectly & the side delicious. Our appetizer was the stuffed pepper & I am still thinking about them. I will return whenever I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong! By far one of the best steaks, a little pricey but WELL worth it. Everyone's steaks came out perfectly cooked all the way through. Compliments to the chef."}
{"text":"Went there once with some co-workers. We were a decent sized group and they accommodated us nicely, although it was a reservation. It's the kind of place that is at least attempting to be upscale. Wasn't bad, but I didn't like it that much.  A bit pricey for lunch, compared to other restaurants on East 4th. I got a chicken BLT sandwich. I thought it was quite good but I am not sure it was worth the pricetag.  The meal did come with challah bread, which was very nice and not something you'd expect from a resturant."}
{"text":"Shut the front door!  Best service in Cleveland.  Scott was just the best, even offered to hold our leftover sides in the kitchen, so we didn't have to carry them around after we were finished.  He thought our entrees took a little long to come out of the kitchen (we didn't notice or mind), so he comped my espresso and brought out some amazing chocolate peanut butter treats from the chef.     The filet is the best steak I have ever had.  I am comparing this filet to my long-time favorite from Bern's in Tampa, FL.  Red's is now in first place.  The sides were great too- truffle mashed potatoes and mac-n-cheese...absolutely worth every penny.    The atmosphere is a little louder, so maybe not a super romantic setting, but easily one of the best dining experiences I have had in a very, very long time."}
{"text":"Great steaks, great sides, professional staff, nice decor and ambiance.  It's hard to go wrong here.  The price is high but you get what you pay for.  If you're looking for a great steakhouse in Cleveland, you've found it."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and the service has been excellent both times.  The arugula and prosciutto salad is to die for. The first time I dined here I got steak, which was amazing. The second time I got the carbonara pasta with shrimp. The amount of sauce was perfect and there was plenty of shrimp! Everyone I dined with loved their meals as well. If you come, you HAVE to get the doughnuts. They are amazing lol. I will continue to come back for special occasions."}
{"text":"I love a good steak so I was excited to try Red for an anniversary dinner celebration. The ambiance and decor are very modern. Our server was also exceptional, I believe his name was Dave. After going over the menu with us, we both selected the filet mignon CAB Prime (8 ounces), the most expensive on the menu at $53 each. You could add a sauce for an additional $3, which my husband did. He tried the horseradish creme fraiche and really enjoyed it. The steaks are brushed with some herbs and garlic as well.  The bread was delicious and accompanied by a cheese and olive oil mixture, which was very tasty. The server offered to bring me olives or something else knowing I couldn't have it - nice touch, but I declined.  The steaks were cooked beautifully and very good. I have dietary issues and cannot have a lot of butter/oil, so the server did not have them brush my steak with oil, but offered to bring me some on the side. I tried just a little, but must say it really elevated the steak to the next level.   For our sides, we selected roasted squash with apples and pecans and Parmesan tater tots. The squash was tasty, a bit sweet and still had a good crunch. The toys were very good as well according to my husband and came with a dipping sauce that \"made\" them. Each side is served enough for 2 and costs anywhere from about $9-12 dollars.  After we wrapped up dinner, the server brought us a plate that said happy anniversary with red Concord grape sorbet. The sorbet was delicious, but the gesture was even nicer. When you are paying a good amount for a special dinner, it's nice when they treat you well with a little dessert complimentary. My husband is a big dessert person and had heard about their donuts so when our server informed us that he was going to bring the donuts, but didn't because I couldn't eat things that were fired, you could see the look of disappointment on my hubby's face. Our server was great and had the kitchen make him 2 to try. My husband said the donuts were good, but the 3 dipping sauces (red raspberry, chocolate and caramel) are what made them. I tasted the caramel and must say it was one of the best I've ever had in my life. I'm still adjusting to my new healthy diet, but cannot say enough about how good the sorbet was either.   Overall my husband and I agreed that this was a terrific meal and money well spent. My only two comments/suggestions are that they should have a side on the menu for the health conscious or be able to make something. I wish a plain baked potato or steamed vegetables would have been an option for me. The server told the kitchen to only use a bit of oil on my squash, but there was still a lot. Additionally, the gentleman who wrapped up our food left out the sauce for my hubby's tots and he was super sad upon opening it up the next day for leftovers. Maybe we should have told him to include it, but part of me thinks you should provide fresh if it is a part of the entree.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"What can you say about Red that has not been said? It's the best steakhouse in Cleveland, hands down. Service is outstanding. Food is outstanding. I have only had memorable amazing nights here."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!   Stopped in for lunch with a coworker and we had a great experience, I will definitely return. We made reservations and were seated right away by the bar. The inside of this establishment is very modern and beautiful. Our server was great, greeted us right away and recommended different dishes on the menu.   We shared the mussels, which were to die for! Probably the best mussels I've had in a long time. They come with a tomato base which makes them really light and refreshing. Make sure to ask for bread to dip into the tomatoy delicious base.   Oh and the bread...yeah it's amazing. It comes with a side of soft butter with honey. Melt in your mouth delicious.   I ordered the Red \"house\" salad which I ordered topped with the salmon. The portion was huge! The raspberry dressing is the perfect blend between sweet and tangy. The salmon was seared to perfection.   All in all, I will definitely return and I highly recommend it for you!"}
{"text":"Bomb steaks in an upscale setting! This place really knows how to season and cook a steak. I had the porterhouse seasoned with a flavorful dry rub. The steak was cooked to perfection and was really tender.   The atmosphere at this place is really pretty formal and a number of people wore jackets and collared shirts. The crowd is generally a little bit older, but its a great place for a fancy date or a special occasion! Plan on spending around $40 for a composed entree.   Location wise, it's very central to a lot of nightlife and other attractions in downtown Cleveland and street parking is pretty readily available.   The waitress was great and gave solid recommendations from her own experience."}
{"text":"I had a nice dinner at Red with two friends.  The service was very attentive, the food excellent and the steaks done exactly right.  Its not inexpensive but its certainly provides the quality and service of a top end restaurant.  Since everything is a la carte it can get very expensive if you want a regular full meal, e.g. appetizer, salad, main meal and side. Sauces are a couple dollars.   So just be well aware of this.  The side of asparagus was exceptional as they lightly pealed the sides of the asparagus and this was new to me. It made the asparagus very fresh, yet both soft and el dente at the same time.  Very nice.  The presentation on the shrimp cocktail was very lovely.  The server did pour the red California wine fully into the glasses and because it was so dark deposited the skins or dregs from the bottom bottle into the glass of one of my co diners that upset her when she swallowed them.  So I think the wine pouring could have been more careful.  A decanter would also have solved this.   I have no reservations other than price."}
{"text":"We went last night to celebrate a birthday, we put that note in the reservation but they never acknowledged it, probably to the birthday boy's delight actually. But people around us got beautiful birthday desserts I would have loved a pic of. We had a party of 6 which I'm sure skews the experience.  He said it was the best steak he has ever had and we tried Ruth Chris for his bday last year!  The truffle potatoes were the highlight of my meal as I cannot eat red meat. Again probably skewing my opinion.  Atmosphere is nice. He said he likes that it was more casual and not as fancy looking as most places at that price point. I wish we had a smaller group because the horseshoe shaped booths looked cozy. We just had the worst table. We had waiters and patrons hitting our backs all night as they walked by despite my chair being all the way pushed in. Again not the end of the world but a little annoying.  The service was good but nothing amazing. Waiter did a great job, water was always full but not overly talkative or friendly. Maybe it was too busy as people are in town for the NBA finals. So I'm not sure I'm giving them benefit of the doubt or if it really is just an okay super expensive steakhouse.  So overall best steak he has over had but not the best service or atmosphere."}
{"text":"A special thank you to Stephanie Pack, GM at Red Steakhouse, Downtown Cleveland. Stephanie and her staff helped make a recent event very memorable for our daughter and her guests. The Waitstaff was very professional, attentive to detail and extremely gracious.  We enjoyed cocktails and appetizers on the Rooftop the views were spectacular! The evening weather perfect. For dinner we were moved into a private dining room which was absolutely stunning with all the white furnishings and very clean lines. Most importantly the dinner was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS, everything was flawless! Our sincere thanks to Stephanie and her professional staff for the special touches and for helping us create such a \"Fabulous Surprise Birthday Event\" a very memorable one!  Thank you.

{"text":"Their filet mignon is one of the best around, and I loved the Kentucky Mule I had. If you're from out of town, it reminds me of the Capital Grille."}
{"text":"It's expensive for a reason- it's well worth the experience. The service was great, our waiter was very personable and explained some items on the menu for us and made some recommendations. Everything was fantastic, our steaks (filet mignon) were cooked per our requests and our sides were just as good. They also serve some of the best complementary bread with an olive oil cheese and herb dip. We will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"Oh, my, gosh....this place is FANTASTIC!   My husband and I made reservations here for our wedding anniversary. I was told by a close friend that Red was \"The Best\" steak she had ever had and perfect for our special occasion. We had to try it out.   They accommodated my request for seating and even wished us a happy anniversary when we walked in. We split a half bottle of wine (long drive home) of a delicious red and commented on how great the bread and olive oil dipping mix was. He ordered a USDA  Prime NY Strip Medium-Rare and I ordered the USDA Prime Filet Medium. Both were cooked perfectly and flavored so well. The meat was perfect. We shared the sides of the Potatoes Au Gratin and Sauteed Asparagus with Bearnaise - both were excellent as well. The staff was continually attentive and friendly.   The restaurant was packed, so therefore there was a bit of noise, but nothing we couldn't handle.   Just when we thought we couldn't eat anymore, our waitress (Allison) brought us homemade powdered donuts with three dipping sauces (Caramel, Chocolate and Red Raspberry) - just melt in your mouth deliciousness.   It was the perfect romantic date night out for us and we have to thank the staff at Red for that. We will absolutely be back and wouldn't change a thing about our experience! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town, and wanted to go out to a nice dinner. We met the manager Dean who was very friendly and hospitable. The service was fantastic, and the atmosphere was also very nice. We shared a couple of apps to starts, the bone in rib eye for 2, as well as some sides. Everything was delicious, and overall was a great and memorable experience!"}
{"text":"I've ate a good piece of steak at many restaurants, events, and on different occasions...  I must say the experience of getting an excellent cut of meat seared to perfection and cooked to my liking at Red's is like none other. The best part is that steak isn't their only specialty!  Their fresh oysters from different parts of the east coast are to die for. Be sure to try the stuffed peppers if you like a spicy kick in your appetizer.   What impresses me about Red The Steakhouse over other well renowned steakhouses is the quality of service and exceptional consistency in providing good tasting food made of choice ingredients. Oh, and service...   All of their staff are highly professional and friendly and know how to make their customers feel welcomed and comfortable. Definitely a gem of a restaurant in Cleveland that deserves the 5-star rating."}
{"text":"I so wanted to give this place a higher rating but honestly?, it was just OK. We met friends for dinner early. Had calamari (which had bad reviews) but it was actually good. The cheese plate was presented nicely but nothing special. I had the prosciutto and arugala salad and enjoyed it. The CAB prime filet was cooked perfectly but was so salty. Not sure if it was the blue cheese on top or if the steak itself. The brussel sprouts were burnt. Like black burnt. However, the creamed spinach was very good. The best dish we shared was the pasta with bolognese sauce. Fresh noodles and delicious red sauce. We finished with the donut holes which were a perfect pairing to our red coffees.  Was it a good meal? Yes. But not $250/ couple good.  Nothing special or creative on the menu that sets this place apart."}
{"text":"This was the best meal of my life. The device was phenomenal, the food was even better. I would fly back to Cleveland just for dinner. Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"I always thought nice steakhouses were for rich people to blow money and that it was a ripoff. A way for the wealthy to puff out their chests and be seen. I did not think there could be much variance in cooking a piece of cow on a grill coated in salt and pepper. My feelings have changed since last night. I had the strip. I am used to getting a strip at a strip joint which makes it a double strip. Usually along the row of strip joints in the flats so it is a strip at a strip on a strip. A triple strip. The aged meat last night had the taste of good beef with a perfect crunchy crust that locked in all of the flavors. The meat did not come out leaking blood, juice and life force of the fallen cow. It was concealed inside this crust. Similar to my crusty self. I am actually a really good dude on the inside. I just look like a crusty schmuck. Now what's beef?"}
{"text":"\"Red, The Steakhouse,\" is in fact, the steakhouse and not just a steakhouse.  Diners are greeted immediately by smiling, courteous maitre d's and escorted to a modern and mildly luxurious dining room.  The walls are decorated in red, mahogany, and  mirrors, with one side offering a look into their room filled with a wide selection of wines through glass windows.    As I sat down, I wondered if the waitress would take my napkin and place it on my lap for me and then hand me an opened menu.  That did not happen and was in a way comforting, because I knew I might have a chance of enjoying excellent food without any pretentious overtones.  I would not have to worry that my laughter would be too loud for the potentially snobby diner seated next to me.  I would be free to enjoy my food for the food.  Don't misunderstand, as the the service was indeed superb.  Having just visited Ken Stewart's East Bank, I ordered very similar dishes including oysters, USDA prime aged filet mignon, lobster tail, and a brussel sprout side.  Everything about Red was better, from service, presentation, and taste to the price and overall ambiance.  You are offered sauce with your steak, but I preferred my steak just as it was.  The sear on the outside was just right with a crunchy, herb crust.  The inside was true to the restaurant's name, red (I order my steaks med. rare).  And although the restaurant is not known for seafood, the lobster was impeccably tender and flavorful.    Oysters had a substantial bite and were served topped with some pickled onions (cocktail sauces was, of course, available upon request).    While I would normally order a chocolate dessert, I decided to try the fried doughnuts after reading some reviews.  They are absolutely to die for if enjoyed immediately while they are still fresh and hot.  And just like an unadulterated steak, try the doughnuts as they are without the provided accompaniments of sauces.  The combination of the powdered sugar, warm fried goodness, and slightly chewy interior is just the delightful way end to a perfect meal."}
{"text":"Steaks are always good here. The drinks are very good but the after dinner doubts are an absolute do not miss. I always have to bring an extra order home for breakfast the next morning. They also have valet here which is great since downtown is tough for parking."}
{"text":"So far out of all the times I've been here, and Red's other location in Beachwood, the same remains true - Red cannot do food wrong.   I got a CAB Strip Steak this time to try something different, something I've never gotten at Red before and generally don't like other places. It was a 14 oz cut and cooked perfectly to my requested temperature. The cut was really lean, tender and generally great - something I would definitely order in the future.   I got my favorite side of green beans. Consistently good and still a favorite. I tried the Mac and Cheese for the first time too. The flavor was good, but I thought the consistency was a bit too soupy.   Service at Red, the Cleveland location in particular, does wax and wane from visit to visit, but the steps of service seem so ingrained in the servers, that even if they aren't carried out with enthusiasm, the various things the waiters are supposed to do rarely go undone.   Red also does a great job recognizing special occasions and making the recognition seamless, sincere and classy.  I'll definitely be back here just as soon as I can convince someone to go with me. Either location is great for food. If you want more of a guarantee in terms of polished service, head east."}
{"text":"holy shit.  been to many steakhouses in my days. Red is absolutely phenomenal.   Got the porterhouse 24oz ($48) totally reasonable price - medium rare.   Not going to lie, it came out a bit overdone. Leaning towards medium. However, it was amazing even so. Amazingly tender meat, great char, and just enough herb mixture on top to give it a light touch. Some of the medium rare pieces that I've got from this dish were unreal. Seriously. Unreal. Best steak. ever."}
{"text":"Probably the worst steak I have ever had. My steak was seared so much that it was burnt black for about the outer 1/2 inch of the steak each side. I dined here with a party of 6 couples, and a few people sent their steaks back and they were just as bad. The appetizers were very bland.  Because there was a group of 12 in my party, there was a 22 percent tip included. The service was terrible. Several of the orders were wrong. I do not mind paying more for dining if the food is great. This place was not good, and the meals were very expensive. I paid for two steaks, four beers, appetizers, and NO dessert and the bill was $360."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Cleveland and after asking several people were we should go for a great steak in the Downtown area, every single person recommended Red. Great wine list, awesome steaks, and above average bar.   Creamed corn is amazing and makes a perfect side   Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I work in the USX Tower and since this is downstairs it makes for a convenient place to have lunch.  They offer a decent lunch for about $20 with a couple of different choices.  I like the medallions with fries and mini donuts for dessert.  If you're downtown at lunch and want affordable steak this is the place."}
{"text":"As a downtowner/westsider, I feel I had been deprived of a great steak house because over the last couple years I have seen the quality of local steak houses i frequently visit (XO, Mortons, Hyde Park) decline, but my GF and I decided we would venture to Red new location down down on 1/2/2015.    To say the least, my first experience at Reds' knocked it out of the park.  The service was great, drinks strong and the food was prepared exactly as we had requested.  This is and will be my new go to Steak House when entertaining clients & out of town visitors.  Keep up the great work, and thanks for being a location downtown."}
{"text":"We had incredible dinner! The French onion soup was delicious, the creamed corn with crumbled corn bread on top, New York Strip and hot, fresh donuts with three sauces for dessert were divine! Scott took great care of us, made excellent recommendations on wine and food, and helped create a memorable experience! I would definitely go back and am just sorry I am only in town visiting and not sure when I will be able to get back to Cleveland. This place rocks and is well worth the price!!"}
{"text":"Great service!  Busy place and great atmosphere.  Had the filet, baked potato and cream of spinach for my meal and it was excellent.  Vibrant, upbeat and delivers on food expectations!"}
{"text":"I'm a steak aficionado, I travel quite a bit, and this place is absolute steak perfection!  Atmosphere and staff are top notch, and steak is otherworldly!"}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviewers, we were greeted graciously at the door and escorted to our table.  The dining room is modern and has a flair of sophistication. Our cocktails were spot on, which is rare because we are very fussy about how our martinis are made and very few places get it just right.  So far, so good, we were anticipating a wonderful evening.... but not so fast.  When the waiter returned after bringing our cocktails he wafted to the table with a stench of an ashtray, I literally had to lean away from him to avoid the smell.  We ordered the calamari (the waiter said it wouldn't have been his choice), we each had the filet with the Oscar style upgrade and the truffle mashed potatoes.   The calamari arrived, it looked delicious with a sauce and what appeared to be pepper strips,  however it was completely void of flavor, all I could taste was the oil it was cooked in. Even the sauce had absolutely no flavor.  I added some salt to finish the spoonful I had put on my side plate, my dinner partner did the same. We decided to let it go and to never order that dish again, we didn't want to complain.  In hindsight, I think we should have been asked by the waiter if there was an issue. Next came our entrees.  The steaks were very good, again, no seasoning, but the béarnaise sauce gave it some flavor. I ordered medium rare, it was served medium, but, it was kind of borderline, so I let it go. The crabmeat was the star.   The side of truffle mashed potatoes tasted like potatoes, water, and truffle oil.  No salt, not butter, no cream, completely void of the richness I would expect at that price point.  Just then the manager happened by and asked if everything was alright, this time I decided to tell him we were disappointed in the potatoes and asked if they could add a bit of cream, butter, and salt. He brought back the potatoes as we were finishing our entrees and told us he would remove them from our check.  There was an improvement in the taste, but no one stopped back to ask us about them. After our plates were cleared we were asked if we wanted coffee and said not just yet, we wanted to finish our second cocktail. We finished our cocktails in about 10 minutes and wanted to order coffee and dessert, but sat for an additional 25 minutes before we were able to flag down the manager and ask for our check, unfortunately our window of opportunity to have dessert closed because we had to make it to a show. The manager apologized for the fact we were not being attended to and offered to treat us to dinner if we would come back. I don't think we will be taking him up on that anytime soon. The atmosphere, the hosts and hostesses, and the bar are all what I would expect at that price point. Where this place failed is the quality of the food (completely under seasoned) and the caliber of the wait staff, they just lack the attention to detail and the refinement you would find at Capital Grille or Eddie Vs.  I truly hope they get it together because this place has the potential to be a fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"Very kind people and attentive. The host hung up our coats, which was unusual and nice. Waiter was very knowledgeable about the specials, menu and wine selection. Food was delicious. Had various steaks and crab cakes--very good. Calamari was good. Had Brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese--yum. The only complaint is that as the evening went on the noise got so loud we couldn't hear to talk."}
{"text":"Service at lunch was incredibly slow and the food was not good. The chicken In the chicken BLT sandwich was over cooked and the french fries were very greasy. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"This brand new steakhouse is a sleek and stylish spot in the Steel Tower, with plenty of room for all the folks that I'm told are clamoring for a great steakhouse in the neighborhood.   Unfortunately, I haven't yet been lucky enough to stay for a steak (I still have to pay rent this month), but happy hour is still pretty solid. They've got $4 beers (Miller Lite, Yuengling) and $6 cocktails and wine (manhattans, martinis, and more) from 3:30-6 pm, M-F.  Although the loaded tots and poutine on the bar menu sounded great, we weren't that hungry and just opted for some seafood. The oysters aren't exactly a steal at $2 per, and the cocktail shrimp are not jumbo enough to be worth $3 each, unfortunately (is that ever a \"deal\"?).   The breadsticks are great though, Sean (behind the bar) is the man, and I'm hoping the steak is worth the price if and when I make it back."}
{"text":"We held our 61 person wedding at Red on June 6th, and I cannot speak highly enough of the quality of the experience or the staff.   I'm not a \"bride-y\" bride, and Kristy (I believe her official title is catering manager) worked very hard to make our event as turn-key as possible for us.  They allowed us to rent out the roof for the ceremony and the cocktail hour, then moved us to the second floor for the dinner. They setup and tore-down for us.  Working with Kristy: She was responsive to our emails and requests, and worked behind the scenes to make sure we had all of the proper details in place (timeline, vendor needs/deliveries, obtaining microphones/linens/ect, working with valet to get a license to allow them to setup early....). She was present on the day of the wedding and went above and beyond to make sure everything went smoothly.  The Food: for the cocktail hour, we had chicken and biscuits, lobster rolls, and cheeses. I didn't get to try anything but the chicken (which was excellent) but I only heard rave reviews from our guests.  For dinner,  we had salmon, filet/lobster, ny strip/lobster, and a vegetarian option. My filet and the groom's ny strip were well cooked and delicious, although we both admitted that the lobster was our favorite.  We also had the Brussels sprouts, truffled mashed potatoes,  and asparagus in bernaise sauce -everything was great. The food was the right temperature and nothing was over or under done (which is a feat to get 61 meals out in a short period of time).  The Cake:  I cannot rave about the cake enough. The on-site pastery chef made it (it counted toward our food and drink minimum too) and it was downright beautiful and was completely in-line with (or cheaper than) the expected pricing if we had gotten it elsewhere.  I had given Kristy a clipping from a magazine, and the cake looked way better.  We were able to do a tasting prior to the wedding as well to pick out the flavors. I really loved the strawberry filling and the fluffiness of the frosting. Absolutely worth every cent we spent on this cake.  The bottom line is that Red helped us create an event that was memorable and very, very us with as little stress as possible.  If we had gone to a traditional wedding venue, it would have cost us more to achieve a lower quality wedding. It was expensive,  but we felt that we received good value, quality, and customer service for the amount that we spent. There is literally nothing that I would change in retrospect.  Thank you to Kristy and the staff at Red for making our wedding wonderful."}
{"text":"Overall we had a good experience at Red, but I do think they could make some improvements. We arrived for our 9PM reservation, and were told they were getting our table ready. We requested a bar table when we made the reservation through open table. We were not sat until 9:40 PM, and were told we could not sit in the bar area. The hostesses did not apologize for our late seating or offer an explanation. However, we were immediately approached by a manager who offered to comp our appetizer, which was nice. We were there for restaurant week, and ordered the mussels, french onion soup, stuffed pepper, filets, and lobster mac and cheese. All of the food was wonderful. I will say that my filet was more on the rare side, and had an odd char on parts of the steak. Overall though, it was very good. Even though it was restaurant week, the food was very basic. I am not sure if we ordered off the regular menu if they would have done more than just filets with steamed broccoli. The mussels were excellent. The service was pretty good, except for the seating issue. Our server was very nice. The overall ambiance was odd, you can tell they built the restaurant very quickly and there is still some construction going on. The bar was very bright and the music was turned up very loud- it did not create a nice \"lounge-like\" experience compared to other high end bars around Pittsburgh. We were not drinking unfortunately, but we looked at the cocktail menu and the cocktails were $13-$15. This seemed slightly pricey for Pgh, but would have been OK if the bar area was more romantic/high end.  I am not sure if I would go back because considering the prices, there are many other restaurants in Pittsburgh that offer a much better dining experience overall."}
{"text":"By far the best meal I have had in downtown Cleveland! As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the manager and taken over to our table. Our server Camille was amazing!!! She guided us through the menu and suggested items for us to try. We started off with crab cakes and jumbo shrimp. When I say jumbo I mean it! For dinner we have a PERFECTLY cooked fillet topped with blue cheese. It melted in our mouth! We also ordered the brussel sprouts, a side of mushrooms, and the loaded potato gnocchi. yummmmm! We finished our meal with a cup of coffee and the warm powdered sugar donuts! A must eat treat!   Thank you Red staff and Camille for making our New Year's Eve dinner one to remember! From the relaxing atmosphere to the cocktails and food Red Steakhouse is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is awesome and very inviting from the minute you walk in the door.  Had the most excellent server/bartender Kimberly who really gave us an amazing dining experience..  the food was beyond delicious.  Got the Seafood Tower and its was incredible.  I don't eat steak, so I really just had a lot of sides!  Mushroom Risotto, Truffle Mashed Potatoes, Brussel Sprouts and Lobster Mac & Cheese..  ok, so not exactly diet conscious, but everything was beyond delicious.  My dining companions all had steaks and they all raved about them...  I'd def recommend this place for dinner and even a great bar just to have a wonderful cocktail at!"}
{"text":"Can I leave more than 5 stars?  From the superb service from...I believe her name was Randy, to the other service people bringing food and checking on us, I felt very pampered.  And the food...the ribeye was cooked to perfection. The bread with the dipping sauce and crumb cheese mix...wonderful.  I had the veal Marsala..I haven't had a veal dish that wonderful in a long time. I live in Michigan so won't be back soon, which breaks my heart.  Maybe a Tigers/Indians game and another dinner must be scheduled!  Thank you for a great evening!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation here for my boyfriend's birthday. He's not a picky eater, but he's also not typically easily impressed. After hearing how mouthwatering Red's steaks were, we decided we'd give it a try.   I did make the reservation on Open Table and indicated on the reservation that it was for a birthday dinner. I didn't expect anything special, but I have to admit I was a little disappointed when we came in with a reservation and they gave us probably one of the worst seats in the restaurant. We were right near the door so we felt a draft every time someone opened the door and felt very close to the hostess stand. Given that I had made a reservation for a special occasion, I had hoped I might have gotten a spot that was a bit more private; especially considering the restaurant wasn't full by any means.   Our server provided excellent service. He didn't hover throughout the meal, but was around when we needed him, which is really all I expect in service from a restaurant like this. We ordered a half dozen oysters as our appetizer as well as an 8oz filet, a 16oz ribeye and two sides: the truffle whipped mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts. I was a little surprised that all of their sides were served a la carte, but after they brought them to our table I understood why. The sides are prepared family style, so each side will provide about 2-4 servings. As for the steak, they offered 3 categories on our visit: aged USDA, Certified Angus Beef as well as a higher grade of CAB beef. They are priced accordingly (good, better, best). On my recollection, there's about a 20% difference in price between the classes of beef, so I think it's up to you whether you prefer to pay more for what's considered a better cut of meat, but at the same time, none of the options they offer are low grade beef, so you'll get a delicious steak no matter what in my opinion.   Our appetizer was fine, I probably wouldn't order oysters here again, but this isn't a seafood restaurant, so no criticism here. The sides as I mentioned were priced a bit high, but it makes sense when you realize they are served family style. The truffle whipped mashed potatoes were delicious, and we got an incredibly huge bowl to share. The brussel sprouts were really lackluster in my opinion. They were glazed on the outside, but the way they were cooked left them a bit mealy on the inside. I suppose I was comparing them to brussel sprouts I've had elsewhere that I'd liked better. The steak though was an absolute marvel. Red prepares steak the way everyone loves it to be prepared, and the way it should be prepared: to temperature, with a crunchy outer crust, lightly seasoned and with no frills. We both ordered our steak medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I can't believe how well they got the outer crust down while still maintaining the integrity of the blue-ish red center. I do believe you can taste the slight flavor difference in this high quality cut of meat. The filet had an almost sweet flavor which I had never tasted elsewhere. I would highly recommend coming here for any steak lover.   Overall, if you're coming to Red for steak, you won't be disappointed. From my visit, I don't think they do much else that stands out. Not bad by any means, but the steak will be the highlight, while everything else is just fluff. While Red is marketed as a \"modern\" steakhouse, I personally didn't find it modern at all, but rather quite dated in the decor. This is just a personal preference though, and it wouldn't deter me from coming here again for a quality steak."}
