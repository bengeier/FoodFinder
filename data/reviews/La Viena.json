{"text":"Had our Valentine dinner there after recalling a friend of mine who had recommended the restaurant as his go to romantic dinner spot.  Service was prompt given that it was a busy night for couples and a number of families who were in there dining.  It was clear from the constant stream of people coming in that this is a popular spot for those in the know.  The food was quite tasty - my boyfriend started with the lobster bisque which had a nice velvety texture with  that delicious sweetness of the ocean.  I had a mixed salad with house made Italian vinaigrette which was fresh and crisp.  We both had a seafood pasta dish studded with shrimp and mussels and a very generous serving of vegetables all presented on a sizzling platter.  It was nicely seasoned and for the price, a very generous size.  The evening was topped off by the strawberry pepe a decadent dessert of strawberries marinated in Grand Marnier with big drizzle of caramel alongside two luscious scoops of vanilla ice cream and a dash of black pepper - perfect for sharing. All in all, it was a very enjoyable dining experience made all the more worthwhile by our server Bob and his \"chinese granddaughter.\"  We will definitely be back and may bring a few friends along."}
{"text":"This restaurant has moved to 16 Ave. NW. It went from being a small italian spot to a larger italian Asian fusion place. Not a good combination! Veal piccata a Limone with Asian stir fry as the veg. Spaghetti Carbonara with more long stringy onion than spaghetti! Not really sure what they are trying to be, but I won't be back to find out!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant when we had not made reservations soon enough for our favorite restaurant.  This was the first time out with our new baby and did not realize that we needed to ask for a third seat.  The lady who took the reservation made us very aware of this fact when we arrived (we will never make that mistake again)

They were busy and the hostess was very pleasant and accomodating finding room for us and the obtrusive baby.  The restaurant was pretty crowded for seating.

Neither me or my spouse were overly fond of the food.  The restaurant was definitely not a traditional italian restaurant.  The prices were some what pricey and not to a quality that we like.  We have heard that this place was good from friends, but is not somewhere that we will venture again."}
{"text":"They said we had not made a reservation (we called earlier in the day)... The appetizer was clearly from a box and heated up, food was average and the service was terrible. It was almost empty and yet they looked annoyed when we 'didn't have a reservation\" and the waiter would disapear for ages at a time. We had to go and find someone to get more drinks and were told \"I'm not your waiter, I'll tell him\" then.. wait  and wait and wait.. ultimately we did not order more drinks. At one point I saw our waite playing the VLT... while we waited for coffee... It was a strage experience overall and we absolultely do not recommend."}
{"text":"Don't blink when you're around west end of Kensington Road or you might just miss this little italian restaurant on the corner of Kensington Road and 21 St SW. A very home-style feel, La Viena offers some Italian dishes that delivers on the comforts of italian cooking.

I ordered the Fettucine La Viena, which featured chicken, sausage and baby shrimp in a tarragon cream sauce. Although the dish was good, not great, I felt that the cream sauce wasn't as creamy as I usually like it, but worked well with the dish. I think the highlight however was the fresh Focaccia Con Bruchette, where the fresh tomatoes and herbs sung beautifully, I just wish they served more focaccia with it! 

Overall, the prices were good for the quality of the food. It's a nice little date place to go to. I am eager to go back and try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"On Calgary's first November '17 very snowy evening we couldn't face cooking dinner. Tried a couple of Chinese delivery outlets, they were so busy, at least an hour or more. So we ventured into the Northwest close to home and headed for La Viena on 16th Ave. Haven't been for maybe a year. 
We had a calamari appetizer, split a Caesar, then had a couple of pasta dinners, (Fettuccine Primavera and Smoked Salmon Linguine). 
I generally find most restaurants to be overpriced for the quality (I'm kinda cheap I admit) but this was not one of those times. 
We both found everything to be delicious, fresh, generous portions, and reasonably priced. The service was prompt and attentive, and the server friendly. A strong recommendation from me!"}
{"text":"Best to go on (look it up) Tuesday or Wednesday, when they 1/2 price the entrees. It is satisfyingly passable Chinese-style Italian. Quite good for the price actually. NOTE: Not for pretentious eaters. No buffalo-massaged fresh mozzarella balls for you to take with your truffle-oil IV. Good food, yo."}
{"text":"I made my first visit to La Viena on a busy Friday night, but our group of 4 was accommodated quickly. 
I have to say I expected a bit more based on the reviews I read. I ordered the linguini with clams in a cream sauce. The cream was very runny and the pasta not cooked enough. My boyfriend's pasta had smoked salmon, but it was waaaay too salty. My friends split a combo dish that included chicken parmigiana and two pasta dishes. It was supposed to be for two, but barely fed them both.
The hostess and server were very nice and efficient, but when my friend ordered his food, he specifically asked if anything had been prepared with pork (religious reasons)  He was assured nothing he ordered had pork , but then he found a giant piece of it in his meal. The server felt bad, but only for a moment. I would expect that the server would comp part of the meal for making a mistake like that, but nope. Just a sheepish sorry. 
So, I will continue my quest for a decent and inexpensive bowl of pasta in town."}
{"text":"A long standing (but newish location) Italian eatery focused on pastas in sauce. We used to go for the offbeat assortment of sauces (e.g. Cream/pear/Brie or anchovy/tomato), but have found over the last few years that they don't pop as much as they used to and the pastas aren't as carefully prepared or plated. An A-OK spot to take family for Italian, but no longer a date spot and no discount night means it's off the list for us."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant,  good value and very accommodating staff.  Food was very tasty.  3 couples, appetizers,  wine and deserts = $100/ couple. On the downside,  seating is tight and the entry way crowded.  Parking is non - existent but community parking is available."}
{"text":"Love this place! I don't give 5 stars very often, but I think this restaurant really deserves it. The food and service is divine! Stop by if your craving a great italian dish."}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough. Very pleasant surprise. Not the most authentic Italian cuisine, but good food & service. Now one of my top picks for a great lunch spot. Go early or make a reservation, the place can get really busy. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, Good Wine, FANTASTIC price...

ideal place for a date or just a nice place for a few friends who enjoy Italian food to go.

EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but they need to fix their heating system. It would swap from warm to very cold. Asked multiple times to turn up the heat"}
{"text":"Four friends entered the restaurant happy to meet for lunch, and all four came out happier. 

For a couple of hours we were transported into a European style restaurant where the servers and owners are hands on, conversational, and show pride and a sense of history in their restaurant. 

Two of us had not been to La Viena since they moved from their Kensington Rd location. 

It was like coming home. The saucier chef must be complimented on the consistent generous fresh flavours and balance of pasta to meat, cheese and vegetable components. Our group was most delighted by the piquant Fettucine Salmone and Gorgonzola Ravioli, as well as the excellent vibrant bruschetta. The coffee was fresh, deep flavoured and thoroughly enjoyed.  

We lingered, far away from the chill of Calgary winter, listened to some low key Christmas music, and chatted with the happy staff, that all of us agreed we would be back in 2018 to visit.  Thank you Ola for your friendly efficiency.

Next time we'll attack that good looking dessert menu. 

It is easy in Calgary to kill one's taste buds on on-again off-again,expensive pub food. 

May I suggest that you treat yourself at no additional cost, to the huge difference in tone of a good restaurant, where food and company are treated with care. 

La Viena staff also showed us their front section where social or business groups can also reserve private space."}
{"text":"Love this little hole in the wall.  My girlfriend lived across the street for a year and we would go here once a week.  Now it's our special spot that we reserve for friends and family.  The food is unique and always cooked to perfection. I've heard other people complain about a creepy waiter that won't leave you alone but I've never encountered him yet so who knows.  This is one of those places that I hope doesn't get too popular, so keep it on the downlow people! ..lol"}
{"text":"This is a special restaurant my friend and I always go to. It is a nice little place to catch up with friends. 

This restaurant is located in the residential area of Kensington, right beside a convenience store. Judging by the outside of the restaurant, it looks worn out, old and maybe even sketchy. However, the interior of restaurant is quite a contrast. The interior setup is typical of Italian restaurants with a  cozy, cheerful and calm ambiance. A down side is that the chair/table space is a bit tight. This is a nice restaurant for smaller groups of friends (3-4), the restaurant can accommodate more but it may be a bit tight. 

The restaurant has parking spaces in front of the restaurant, but if the lot is full there is typically parking on the street across from the restaurant. 

The restaurant has decent service. I've been here a fair amount of times and the service is quite consistent. One waiter (which has served us pretty much every time) is very friendly, upbeat, and unique. The food is served in a reasonable amount of time, and the waiter comes back to ask how the food is. Fresh bread is served to you once you are settled and drinks have been set on the table. If you need drink refills, more bread or to pack something to go the waiter is very quick.

Food wise, the price of the food is cheap and the portions are large. The flavor of the food is just right, not too salty...I personally enjoy my cream sauce pasta dishes which I find are delicious here. However, if you are looking for an authentic Italian restaurant this may not be your choice."}
{"text":"Upon approach, you get the sense from the way the building looks that you should prepare to defend yourself from whoever is lurking in the shadows, or at the very least get ready to dig out of the rubble after the building's impending collapse. Not true, though; the entrance is a portal to another world! The atmosphere inside reminds me of walking into an Italian Grandmother's house, complete with ornately-framed paintings and murals on the walls. Unicorns slide down rainbow slides and call out the menu items before vanishing into thin air. Multi-coloured fairies flutter between tables delivering food items and offering drink suggestions. They have a vineyard RIGHT INSIDE THE RESTAURANT! Ok, ok...maybe these last bits are a result of breathing the asbestos...but STILL!

Really, though: 5 stars! People keep talking about the lack of service here...what do they mean? Each time my fiancee and I have gone in(5 times now) we have had one of two waiters. These guys are charming and authentic, with a real knowledge for the food. The last time we went there before they moved the owner was the cook, and she made the gnocchi to order. So good! GO!"}
{"text":"My favourite italian spot! Sorry Olive Garden, you've been had! This place is in the most unlikely spot and if no one ever told me about it, I would have blinked and missed out. I often come here for special occasions with family. 

I recommend the Penne Alla Pollo with Chicken, peas, tomato in garlic wine sauce or even the Penne Hawaiian with sausage, pineapple, chicken in a garlic tomato cream. If you're looking for a started soup, check out the Zuppa Stracciatella (Whipped egg in consume broth). mmmmmm.

If you want to come out, I highly recommend that you call in with a reservation. The place is pretty tiny and hard to accommodate groups larger than 6. But a great Italian local, none the less."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night hoping to have a nice meal. The bf looked up reviews and thought it was promising. Sadly the best part of my meal was the water and I barely got enough refills since our server was more involved in embellishing his conversation with each table that I even got tired for him. Being a server myself I had the urge to get up and finish serving his other waiting tables for him :/ We ordered the house salad which was okay but drenched in dressing. The calamari was okay until the butter in the batter begins to kick in and drain out any other flavors, the lobster bisque was more like a cream soup with bits of lobster. Granted it tasted okay but coming from Maine, I've had every type of lobster bisque available and this wasn't even close to a bisque. Let's not even bother go into our two pasta dishes. It was just poorly made and considering the fact that we left more than half the plate and a good portion was spit out asparagus that was not edible you can use your imagination on how they may have faired. I'm sad to say that The pasta bags from Trader Joes tasted better and had more quality. 

I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they can make better food since we saw other plates come out and people looked to have enjoyed them, we must have just been unlucky. That being said, I'll leave the luck to others and not take any more chances."}
{"text":"Our server was a sweet lady and she made our experience enjoyable. My mom and I have both liked this restaurant in it's prior location besides the crowded area, which the new location doesn't suffer from!

We had calamari to start and it was nice and crispy. I had pasta with a wine sauce and clams and it was tasty too! My mom had (ugh) gorgonzola cream ravioli. I hate gorgonzola, but she loves it and always orders it. Our server raved about it too! 

I enjoyed the warm atmosphere but they are begging for a renovation... the booth fabric is western themed!!! Definitely lots of room for more patrons.

Will return!"}
{"text":"Not bad, similar to chianti's cafe or other mid-low range Italian spots in Calgary.  We had the Vienna style muscles to start and they were pretty lacking.  Served in a generic poutine or baked spaghetti dish they were small and not very good.  Only 10 muscles and 1 of them was served even though it was closed and another was smashed with shell fragments in the sauce...crunch...crunch.  This might have put a damper on the rest of my experience as they were probably the worst muscles I've had at a restaurant... 

From there we went into a couple Pasta options.  My salmon linguini was ok.  Smoked salmon seemed overly salty, tomatoes were neither ripe nor fresh.  She has a similar variation on the butter cream sauce with chicken, mushrooms, brie, and peppercorns.  It wasn't too memorable either.  

Overall and adequate pasta feed but I'd put it in a league with Chianti's or other similar Italian places... not a destination to experience anything unique or particularly well executed.  Doesn't warrant the reviews it gets here IMHO.  That said I'd go back, but more likely on a boring Tuesday when I'm too lazy to cook than on a Friday when I'm out more for the unique exciting food experience."}
{"text":"We were tired after a long day of driving from Regina we were heading to Earls when we passed La Viena. We were seated promptly and guided through the extensive menu. The food came fast and was piping hot. Portion sizes are large and delicious. We didn't have desert but I'm sure equally as delicious. The decor could use a update and the lighting could use a dusting. We will certainly return."}
{"text":"La Vienna is a quaint little restaurant, in a location that doesn't seem to lend itself to this kind of restaurant. The outside looks sketchy, and it is attached to doggy day care. I felt weird going here, but I like Italian food so here we are.

The food  was good, not great, but good. No complaints, it just didn't rock my world. The selection of pasta's is great, pretty much anything I could imagine, plus a little more, I could have ordered. 

The service was decent, we had a bizarre waiter but he was doing his best and picked out a nice bottle of wine for our table. 

The atmosphere was nice, much nicer than the outside of the building. Quiet, we weren't there at a particularly busy hour, but it was intimate and lovely. 

Not much else to say, good authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Friendly, knowledgeable servers.  Excellent food.  Cozy ambience."}
{"text":"Ok, this place has been ranked quite highly by others but I was not pleased at all. 
The service was very disappointing, yes the restaurant is quite busy but very sparsely staffed.  I found the pasta to be just a-ok. I will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"It is easily the worst italian food I have had in northwest calgary *ever*.
Yes,  *ever*.

We came across the relocated La Viena and thought it would be good to go.
My wife and I both agreed to never return.  Not because the service was bad, but rather because the food was simply horrible.  No italian with any sense of pride would feed food like that to his guests, let alone people who paid for the food.

You would be way better off with the litany of other italian places in the NW NE region (down edmonton trail either way) than going here.

Provolone Cheese arrived in a heavy fish stick like batter (triangle)
The sauce that game with it was like a tartar sauce with some vile tomato mixture added (really poor)

My carbonara had pretty much Raw onions with it.  Heavy handed cream sauce and just boring. Oh a sprig of parsley ? Really?

My wife had a seafood platter with very sparse amounts of sea food.
She asked for it \"not spicy\" and she got seafood caccitorre.  With a sauce that was simply vile not matter what you added to it.  My wife actually ate the seafood on the plate and left everything else.

I hate being a food snob, but compared to the local competition, this place was a waste."}
{"text":"Quite expensive for what you get, better alternatives close by, for similar prices- but very family friendly with attentive staff."}
{"text":"Since my last review,  La Viena closed for lunch and cut back on their menu.  A smaller menu is generally a good thing for a restaurant trying to serve good fresh food but I feel like my options are a but low and forced into the diner time slot I don't get here that often anymore.    Don't get me wrong,  it's still yummy but it's largely because I used to enjoy them as a lunch break from work and our \"thing\" doesn't mesh well anymore.

I did see signage for La Viena in the old North Hill Diner location on 16th street saying it's coming soon.   I'm not yet sure if they are moving or expanding but location is probably the worst thing going for this place and it might be interesting to see them in a LARGE location with great exposure.   Either they will explode or they will just water down the charming concept of this little hole in the wall but time will tell."}
{"text":"Went with my daughter December 14th. Food was pretty good! I had the spaghetti and meat balls. very nice.

The best was the dessert. We shared the vanilla icecream with cracked pepper and strawberries sauteed in grand mariner. MMMM! The ice cream could have been homemade, but delicious non-the-less.

Service was adequate, meals came out fast. I would recommend."}
{"text":"This was our second time here, we found this place last time we were in Calgary and went with a big group of people they accommodated us with no problem and we were a walk in. This time it was just 2 of us and it was outstanding. Both the food and the atmosphere are very warm and inviting. Fresh made pasta, pan sauces and very hefty portions make this place a must visit if you're looking for some very classic Italian fare."}
{"text":"Being across the street from a friend's liquor store and a popular local ice cream place, I had seen La Vienna several times since moving to Calgary.  But I was always hesitant about trying it out.  Why?  Because honestly, it looks like a dive.  Nestled next to a convenience store and some type of pet store in a building that probably predates Calgary, it really doesn't look very appealing from outside.

It was, however, recommended to us by a friend.  So one day we decided to take a chance.  I am forever grateful that we did.

Inside, La Vienna isn't much better visually, but it works.  It has a very rustic feel to it that oozes Italy.  Think Chianti, but darker and older.  The service was great and it was a very comfortable experience.

The food was excellent.  It's a little expensive for what they provide, nothing you can't find at other restaurants.  But the quality was incredible.  And it's conveniently located across from an ice cream parlour.  Or next door to a pet store (actually, I think it's a pet grooming or pet kennel or something).  In either case, it makes for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Came here for a team lunch as a suggestion from one of my teammates. I actually liked the place and the food. It was reasonably priced and very tasty. They have plenty of options to choose from: pasta, salads, pizza, sea food plates, etc. I got to try the lunch box which is a salad and half pasta.
We were thinking of ordering the Tiramisu as we heard it was very good but we were already full and decided to leave it for the next time.
They take reservations and have their own parking."}
{"text":"fave Italian place in town
great staff
great food
great prices
great location with ample parking."}
{"text":"A group of us of  6 adults went to celebrate a birthday dinner at La Viena.  We've gone here before and have usually enjoyed our meals and the occasional dessert.  We ordered the calamari appetizers which were light and enjoyed by all.  We also ordered french onion soups and the lobster bisque and they were also good.
The entrees ordered were not too bad and were ok but didn't seem as good as they used to be.  I ordered the lasagne entree and I was very disappointed.  It seemed to be a layered square of pasta with lots of meat sauce layered between the pasta squares and since the dish was a small oval form, the ends of the dish was also crammed with meat sauce too.  There was hardly any cheese layered in nor melted on top.  I've been to restaurants where at least your lasagne was a nice toasty cheese topping and often would have melted cheese layered as you eat it.  But this entree was almost just meat sauce and pasta squares just in the middle.  I could only eat half of it and did not like it at all.   It felt like they were getting rid of some extra spegetti meat sauce or something.  We also ordered a dessert of strawberries with vanilla ice cream and grand marnier sauce.  It came to the table with the ice cream quite soft so it must have sat on the counter and started melting quick.  We had to quickly eat it and the the syrup that was drizzled on the plate had hardened under the ice cream and was not able to mix with the ice cream. It was kinda petrified to the plate in a drizzle or like hard honey or something.
Too bad this didn't turn out as well as I had hoped.  Was quite disappointed and probably will be looking for a different little Italian place to dine at.  It used to be good , but maybe service has gone down now since it was busy and I feel the waiter could have been more attentive to filling water and checking with us now and then.
I may try one more time , but not too keen after this episode...."}
{"text":"The food at the new location is just as good as it was in Kensington. The pasta is all handmade and the sauces are super flavorful. Meh on the zucchini sticks but awesome Alfredo and Caesar salad.  I usually stick to my downtown bubble but was happy I ventured out ! Awesome service by our witty server Kyle."}
{"text":"Easy to find, inexpensive dishes, super fresh and delicious pasta, cozy atmosphere.  Don't let the exterior of the restaurant fool you."}
