{"text":"The portions are huge and the owner/chef is very nice. You can get a giant scoop of rice or noodles, 2 generous entrees, soup, and an appetizer for less than $7. It's setup like mall food with typical Chinese American dishes and steam trays but he instead makes everything fresh. Its amazingly quick. In less than a minute he's done making your dish from scratch if there isn't any currently available."}
{"text":"This is my new Friday night Chinese take out.  Dinner for two includes cheese ragoons, egg rolls, soup, two entrees and rice.  All for just under $13.  I have yet to be disappointed with any.  It is truly the best egg drop soup I have eaten in Madison.  Sure it is in a random strip mall, and limited seating but the guy who runs it is always friendly.  He will cook it up for you if you ask.  Yummy."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for carryout and was not disappointed. The man (I assume he is the owner) is very friendly and cooks your food right there while you wait. It is a small menu, but as others have said there are huge portions and for not a lot of money. I asked him if he has been busy and he said no. Hopefully, more people will start ordering so he stays in business!"}
