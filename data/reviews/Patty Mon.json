{"text":"Food is plain and dry for me.. Very basic rice and jerk chicken, I'm disappointed that they don't add sauce in their rice... They need to add more into their plate like salad and a donut bread. The Place closed down not too long ago"}
{"text":"Ive been craving caribean food and happen to be passing by.I was looking for a full plate but only saw roti and patties.I ordered a chicken and veg pattie to go.I was happy to know I can make it a combo for 5$ with a drink(smiles).I selected young coconut juice..it was light and sweet.I liked the veg filling and really enjoyed the pattie itself.Flaky and flavorful.I thought the chicken was a bit to spicy,but Im not really into very spicy so Im partial.I ate it and wanted another so I give everything a solid B."}
{"text":"Small, no frills Jamaican restaurant. Only a few seats and tables available for a quick bite. I've only had the patties here and I have enjoyed them thoroughly. The dough is perfectly flaky and soft at the same time, the filling generous and spicy (just the way I like it). I've tried every type of patty but my favourite one is the beef one. The service here is warm and friendly. Looking forward to trying their other menu items."}
{"text":"I was craving jamaican food so I went there since it 10-15 mns away from my house. Inside was really clean and the lady at the cash register was so nice we even had a little chit chat about festivals & dumplings lol , she was really thoughtful , i dont like cabbage salad so she gave me soup as a substitute. I had the bbq chicken , with rice a dumplings & fried sweet plantains , soup  and a drink for 8.05$ after tax. I'll certainly come back again"}
