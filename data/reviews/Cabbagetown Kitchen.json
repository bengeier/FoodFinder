{"text":"The chicken is good. Other than that unimpressive and overpriced. Recently went in to get a poutine although their poutine had never impressed me simply because it was close by and easy. Worst poutine I ever had. The gravy was more like a soup broth than a gravy and flavourless. Grated mozzarella (I already knew to expect that) and soggy fries. I will probably never go back again."}
{"text":"This place use to be amazing. The burgers use to be Big and juicy and full of garlic. Now with new owners the food has gone down hill. I went for take out today ordered a cheese burger and wings. Got home no cheese(annoying) since I payed for extra for cheese,one thin small slice of tomato on the burger and it was dry and tasteless and tiny? And they forgot my coke which i paid for!! I ordered hot wings and the flavor of the hot-sauce was terrible. I won't be going back and I won't recommend this place either. It's too bad."}
{"text":"Try the chicken lunch special. It's only $4.99 and really, really good. Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Walking home from work and I decided to finally try this place out. I ordered take out and was not impressed when I got home and ate the food. I ordered the chicken dinner special that comes with rice, potatoes and salad (I chose Greek Salad).  The chicken was small, dried out so there was no meat left. The rice and potatoes were so tasteless salt and pepper or any seasoning could not have saved them. The only DECENT thing was the Greek salad. You can't really mess up a Greek salad. Will not recommend this place not will I ever go back."}
