{"text":"AWESOME BURGERS!!!!!!  I highly recommend it to everyone. Everything is freshly made per order. Clean and simple menu no gimmicks just a good old-fashioned hamburger made the way Ilike it."}
{"text":"There is no burger restaurant located in the Scottsdale area and finally there is one. By far one of the best quality food I have ever had. This concept is very unique, different and simple. It is based as a \"build your own\" menu and has a great amount of toppings/ condiments, fries, onion rings, and a selection of loaded fries. Customer service is so important when it comes to the restaurant industry and Scottsdale Burger Bar gave it all! This will be my go to place for burgers!"}
{"text":"The gourmet fries are the bomb!  The burgers delicious!  The service tremendous and it's an A+!"}
{"text":"Had this for the first time and got it delivered by Uber eats... WOW!! Such a good burger. Got the bacon cheese burger with house sauce and meat was cooked and seasoned so well. It's mouthwatering flavor makes me want it again! And the onion rings were absolutely amazing as well!! Highly recommend if you're looking for a yummy burger."}
{"text":"The burgers and cheese fries were delish!!! My daughter and I shared a turkey burger with cheddar, hot sauce, and jalape√±os on the side along with an order of fries smothered in cheese sauce. My husband had a double cheeseburger classic style with fries and onion rings on the side. It was all sooo good! I loved how we could pick turkey or beef for the burger (they also offer veggie burgers). Most burger places only offer beef or chicken breast. My family loves turkey burgers. Now we don't have to spend $12 for an amazing turkey burger! We will definitely be back- very soon! I apologize for the picture of our food - almost gone! I actually only took the picture to send my son so he could see what he was missing out on;0)"}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken fries are killer and the customer service was outstanding. We will definitely be back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"I went here based on all the 5 star reviews, but do not believe that this place deserves that high of a rating.  I'd say this is a slightly upgraded in and out or smash burger, but not the high quality I was expecting after reading the reviews.
The main issue is they don't let you choose how you'd like your burger cooked all burgers are cooked well done. The fries were nothing special.  The whole experience was alright, but definitely do not think I was at the same place as any of the 5 star reviews.  I'd rather hit up Preston's for happy hour next time I'm in the area for my burger fix."}
{"text":"Scottsdale burger bar is unbelievable and not like your local burger joint, the food quality is amazing and very tasty recommend 10/10"}
{"text":"So glad this place opened.  Been here a handful of times and it's always a great decision .Vince and the staff are very attentive.  Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Scottsdale Burger Bar and it did not disappoint! 
No frills, really pretty spartan inside, but they more than make up for it in quality burgers. We each got a double burger with our choice of cheese and condiments (each slightly different per our taste-plenty of choices). My son also got a chili dog and we split the chili cheese fries as a family...
More than enough to eat (too much really) but it is a new restaurant and we wanted to try everything...
Really good flavor and a very nice staff, which is rare in Scottsdale. 
Only concern was that the fries were a little over cooked for my taste but it is a new place and I suspect the cook will get more comfortable with experience. Could have been intentional as it did keep the fries from getting soggy with the load of chili and cheese that was ladled on them!"}
{"text":"Great Burgers Fries Onion Rings and good choices of condiment In A Great Location. Great Service...They own Pita Cafe next door as well. Yummmz gotta try it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went last Sat.  It was the Best Burger in Scottsdale...the bun was big enough to hold the double burger and fixings together but wasn't like so many gourmet places with a BIG fancy bun bigger than the burgers.  We sat outside and really enjoyed our burgers and fries.  Everyone was so friendly and it will be our Go To Burger Place.  I don't do a lot of reviews but this was one I had to do...Try it!"}
{"text":"This is a great place! Real burgers, not thin frozen patties, & hot dogs.  Great fries & onion rings.  This is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Amazing food and amazing service. Love the fact that I can load up my burger with multiple toppings  with the options given . Also can we talk about the fresh shakes! So Happy to have this near me now. I value mom and pop shops , it shows the care in the quality and service for the clients. Next time Im coming for a loaded Dog and Onion rings!!!

Welcome to the neighborhood Scottsdale Burger Bar!!"}
{"text":"Onion rings and burgers. A great Friday evening meal 

The service is excellent 

Everything is made fresh each day. Nothing is retained from the previous day. Patties are hand pressed 

I could taste the freshness 

The onion rings; perfect amount of crunch and not greasy. 

The burgers were good. The buns toasted nicely

Large and generous patty. The lettuce was crisp and crunched when I bit into the burger 

All in all a good burger 

Super clean 

Pepsi is served here"}
{"text":"Wish yelp had more stars to give this place.  What a great burger - bun, toppings, sides.. all came to perfection.  And somehow the customer service was equally great. 
#realpeople #realfood"}
{"text":"Really Good! I'm so glad they opened this place! Priced right and Burgers are fantastic. Does resemble In & Out (nothin wrong with that) but a little bigger. I also tried the Black Bean veggie burger and it was very good. Friendly staff..girl at counter real nice."}
{"text":"We had to try this after all the good reviews but we found the burgers tasted precooked and nothing special."}
{"text":"Great burgers! In a party of six, and everyone enjoyed their food. They offer a variety of cheeses, toppings, and sauces for their burgers. Everyone's burgers were hot and juicy. The fries were fresh and crispy. They also offer a variety of hotdogs, and kids' menu with chicken tenders. The selection of milkshakes was intriguing, but didn't try.  I will next time."}
{"text":"It's not fancy, but the burger is legit. I got the double and I would rate it as very good. My sort of girlfriend got the veggie burger and liked it. The fries were good not great. Very reasonably priced. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing. I was craving a burger so I thought I'd stop by this new joint To try it out. Well I'm glad I did because I had the most amazing burger ever! The bun was amazing, the patty was perfectly cooked and tasty and the toppings were on point. I also got the buffalo chicken fries which were amazing as well with melted cheese buffalo and ranch on top with chicken. I will definitely be back! Yumm!"}
{"text":"Great family owned business that knows their stuff!  Excellent burgers and other items.   Super friendly and clean.   This is our new go to burger place"}
{"text":"Burgers were the best in town, but the hotdogs were not good at all. Very cheap menu definitely recommend the burgers"}
{"text":"I updated my review to 5 stars because they cleaned the place up by replacing the flooring to make it look \"cleaner\"!  It's a great place to stop by and get a burger, fries and onion rings!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com! In n out is usually my go to for a quick good burger but Scottsdale burger bar has replaced them! Unreal burgers and to top that their fries are even better. I go in at least once a week for a bacon cheeseburger and their buffalo chicken fries. To top that service was incredible, staff was beyond nice and very quick with cleaning down tables for the next customers!"}
{"text":"Burger was amazing!  Onion rings were delicious.  Service was outstanding.  Found this place on a whim and will definitely head back!"}
{"text":"I totally wish I could give this place a better review because the service was great,it was clean, and fries and onion rings were delightful. But I spend quite a bit on a veggie burger with a side of onion rings. I think 13 which is a little steep for a fast-ish food type place. But not that bad if the food is worth it. I ordered a veggie burger and Idk if I set my expectations too high but that's probably one of the worst veggie burgers I've ever had. Idk what brand patty they used, I don't mind that they used a frozen boca or morning star burger, but whatever type they chose had like a really weird flavor. The mushrooms I got on top tasted pretty funky too. I feel like if a place is charging $8.99 for just a veggie burger, it better be a decent veggie burger. I couldn't even eat the bun because it had the flavor of the nasty patty on it. But on the plus side the people working there are incredibly nice! Very friendly, checked on us to see how we were doing, fast service. Also the fries and onion rings are delicious. If I'm craving one of those I might come back, they gave my sister a huge side of fries. But I'm staying away from that veggie burger.."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here for the first time, it was phenomenal. The meat patty was so full of flavor, and complemented with a soft golden bun. The French fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and so fluffy on the inside. Not to mention how friendly their staff was; it was busy when I came in, but I never felt like I was forgotten about. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"If you want a good burger in a casual atmosphere, this is the spot. The staff is super friendly and you relay feel that they care that you're satisfied. The fries are great. Try them all. Order your burger exactly the way you want it. 

You won't regret your visit here."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy just plenty of flavorful food done right. This is a family business not a chain - that alone is worth 10 stars. Burgers are ground fresh daily and you totally build your burger or dog your way. Servings are generous, fries are crispy on the outside and fluffy within; onion rings have a light coating and are cooked to perfection. Pepsi products are served. Very clean and a great wait staff.

I'll definitely be back and tell all my friends!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries!  Just opened and I found it by chance.  I will definitely be back!  Great service and very clean establishment.  Well done!"}
{"text":"The burgers were amazing! The entire team made sure that everyone and all of the meals were top notch. I loved the chili cheese fries! Huge portions and really tasty food! Very casual atmosphere but very fresh food! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Classic and solid burger and hotdog establishment. Wide variety of French fry combinations. Many cool toppings for burgers and hotdogs. And a wide variety of different kinds of Gatorade, which I thought was neat!"}
{"text":"Just what this area needed. A burger joint that has a straight to the point menu and great prices. So glad to have a new lunch spot."}
{"text":"Our family came to the area for a convention and stumbled upon this place. Everything else was just chain restaurants so we wanted to try something different. Good thing my husband found this place. 

Real good burgers and hot dogs, just the way I like them. Fresh and with grilled buns. Tons of choices for toppings and sauces, including their house sauce which is basically a thinner thousand islandish sauce with less relish. My husband had the cheese burger and inhaled it. I had a hot dog and it was cooked to perfection. We shared a soda but I saw others with ice cream shakes. 

They also have loaded fries which seemed like an entree. We had the buffalo chicken fries and it was tasty.  Chicken and fries were still crispy despite the sauce smothered on it. 

I'd recommend this place If you're craving a burger or hot dog. Clean and new. They've got a tv too."}
{"text":"Great burger joint when looking for something quick and casual. Burgers are cooked great and have that crispy edge which is oh so good. Onion rings were crispy and the serving was huge. Fries are great also. Glad to have something like this in the area."}
{"text":"Our first visit -- was excellent!  I had a cheeseburger with mushrooms and it tasted great.  Their house sauce was a good choice for the burger.  Fries were also good --- and all the food was fresh and hot.

The staff was friendly and gave it a neighborhood feel.  I will definitely go back when I'm ready for another burger."}
{"text":"Great food and service. 

I really enjoyed The Onion rings.

 The double was more than I could eat."}
{"text":"Loved this burger bar! For as small as this place is (it used to be a Starbucks) there is so much character and plenty of seating. Not only was the food amazing but the employees were wonderful. I had a cheeseburger and a chocolate shake, so good!"}
{"text":"Please read this review!!! If you are looking for a burger joint that truly doesn't disappoint a sets a new bar for the burger industry go to this place! I got the loaded bbq chicken fries and I swear my mouth is still tingling from the amazing sensation they provide. I was greeted by excellent customer service. And honestly I will be back. No questions asked everything is fresh here every single day. Honestly this burger joint is going places like serious places. When when I enter the gates of heaven someday I better see a Scottsdale burger bar around the corner.  but seriously everyone needs to try this place"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. Reason for 3 stars is I heard an employee possibly the manager drop the F bomb 3 times while dining on the patio, even though the person was on the inside.  Was glad there were no children dining at the time.

{"text":"One of the best burger joints in AZ  worth every dollar and the drive there. I recommended this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"Burger perfection.  Onion rings are a must for me at a burger joint, and they did not disappoint!  New favorite burger place!"}
{"text":"New restaurants are fun, but they almost always fail. They're too complex, too hipster, or sometimes too rat-infested. 

I went to the Scottsdale Burger bar with a healthy amount of skepticism, hoping it wouldn't be a pretentious, snobby $18 kale burger joint with visible rodents but thinking it was probably just too good to be true.

I was wrong. It is fantastic and I'm gonna try to break down just why I liked it so much.

I ordered a double bacon cheeseburger and a chili / cheese dog, onion rings, and a Pepsi. Because I added mushrooms and extra cheese, the burger was a bit more, but it was still less than 10 bucks, a steal in my opinion.

The overall feel of the place is like a diner, with plastic and stainless-steel and the food is delivered on trays, so if you're thinking of this for a romantic night out, you might want to reconsider.

Bread should be complimentary to a burger and not overwhelm the flavor, and this was perfect. The patties were about the same thickness as In-N-Out and were charred a bit, but moist, with good flavor. 

There's a good selection of sides, from peppers to relish, four different cheeses, so you can pretty much build whatever burger you like. 

The onion rings were crispy and tasty, but that's not why you go to a burger joint. It's all about the burger and they nailed it.

I haven't said anything about the hot-dog, because I was too full to eat it. By the time I'd finished the burger and about half of the onion rings, I was stuffed.

I had a bite just to see what it tasted like and the hotdog was excellent, with a nice crispy skin, but I just couldn't do it. My eyes were clearly bigger than my stomach.

The staff was SUPER nice and asked a ton of questions about what we liked and what they could do better, something you just don't see in most places.

The short answer is that the food rocks, the staff is great, and there were no rats, so five stars, congratulations!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale Burger Bar is the bomb! Simple menu, but still with a good variety of choices, excellent fries and huge portions. Just make sure you're hungry when you stop by.

Located in the Safeway Plaza at Pinnacle Peak and Scottsdale Road this is the best place for burgers in the area, by far. It's a no frills kinda place on the smaller side, but it used to be a Starbucks. When the food is this good you don't need that much room. The people will come. Add to that a friendly staff and you couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Wow! 2nd time here and it's better than I remember. Service is great and responsive. The food is timely and delicious (understatement). Priced really well for the quality and the portion. I dined in twice and found the inside to be clean and really chic (50's diner). This is a must stop if you are looking for a quality meal. I had the Bacon Cheese Double with fries. One of the best burgers in Phoenix metro. Up there with Wineburger and better than Smashburger (two of my favs). This place is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This will be my go to place for burgers from now on. First of all the service from Grayson was awesome; she is so sweet friendly and welcoming!! And then the food. Scottsdale burger bar does the basics and they do it really well. The beef is perfectly cooked and juicy and served with your choice of toppings on a perfectly toasted bun. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with well done French fries, and they cooked it to order in almost no time at all. It is a small  restaurant and closes at 8:00 Pm so get there early! . I believe they are also on  Uber eats so if you don't feel like leaving the house,order from the Uber eats app on your smartphone! 

Well done Scottsdale burger bar! My first visit was fantastic. Couldn't be happier !"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Scottsdale!!!
Excellent place to eat lunch in a hurry. Fast service with amazing and friendly customer service. This is my go-to spot for an amazing lunch.
Amazing ingredients = amazing burgers."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! My first time visiting because I was in the area and it was so worth it!! My fianc√© and daughter loved it too we ordered the cheese burger and chili cheese fries  best burgers we tried so far  the workers are really nice and the owner as well they made us feel welcome! Definitely will be back next weekend when some family lol!! Thank you so much burger bar"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, I highly recommend if you're looking for a good burger place."}
{"text":"Scottsdale Burger Bar took over the old Starbucks location in the Safeway shopping center! I believe it is owned by the Pita Cafe folks next door as I've seen the employees go back and forth between the two businesses. Both businesses have great customer service. Staff are friendly and efficient. 

The burger was $6 and it was $2 extra for second patty. The cheeseburger tasted great; it came with choice of toppings and sauces. They have really good buns; not too thin or thick but just right. The onion rings and fries were tasty as well. 

This will be my go to spot to cure the burger and fries/onion ring cravings."}
