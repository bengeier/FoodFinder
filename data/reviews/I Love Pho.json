{"text":"There are few pho options near by this area so it is refreshing to have a pho place so close by (live in the area). Popped in to try it out and ordered pork and meat ball vermicelli with spring roll for under $7 as takeout. Everything was fresh and tasty. The spring roll was very good and reminded me of a Filipino spring roll (Lumpia Shanghai). The meat ball was delicious as well as the fish sauce and vegetables included (lettuce, carrots, and bean sprouts). However the pork wasn't plentiful and a bit overcooked and dry. For the price however, it is tremendous value. I just wish there was an option of sizes/quantity. It is very decent inside although small. Hope it is here to stay."}
{"text":"I ordered #417 (Grilled pork and grilled beef wrapped in herbs Vervicelli) was pretty good. The meat were nicely seasoned and weren't dry or burnt. In regards to why I didnt give it a 4 star rating is because of the pho. The soup broth has a nice taste but beef balls arrived a little cold, which I thought was a big no-no. We also had their Fresh Rolls with Grilled Pork, which was okay. 
I will come back again and recommend their Vervicelli."}
{"text":"I can't go to any other pho place after coming to this place! The meat and everything is just so much better.  Staff are quite friendly.  The only reason I'm giving it a four start is because there is a wait every time I come.  But the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Had the stew beef pho and the lemon grass chicken rice to go. The stew beef was too oily for me (it had a layer of oil on top) and the chicken was a whole piece. No knife was given to my take out."}
{"text":"best pho place in town! only thing is the place is small, not very many seating area, i would suggest you to go off peak hours, or during weekdays."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE FAILED. This year, I get to choose the place to celebrate my mom's birthday. Positive reviews on this place - convinced me to give it a try. We were 12 in total. 9 adults, 3 kids. The staffs seemed annoyed by our number since the place was small. But, hello? Shouldn't you be thankful? 

When our orders arrived, staff will say the number of the dish loudly - making us confused. It is our first time, but these staffs are expecting us to be a pro on their menu. No respect at all. 

I want to shout at specifically on their lady cashier. Please be reminded that people come back not just for the food but for the friendly faces that welcomes them. Stop being rude or I Love Pho will soon be one of the businesses that shows permanently closed on google search.

This is the shortest celebration we had. We stayed for an hour and left unhappy right away. 

If I can change their name, I would name it - I Hate Pho.

Customer Service is the key!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout pho and found it greasy. My only complaint but it was good. Resto was packed and shows that it is a favourite."}
{"text":"I am writing an updated review to reflect my observations since opening and my several unfortunate experiences at I Love Pho. After attending this restaurant weekly since opening month and after having read updated reviews regarding depreciating quality of customer service, I will say I am hugely disappointed. 
When the restaurant opened, it appeared to pride itself not only on amazing food but great customer service. Both of these have suffered over time. I was rudely spoken to by staff on multiple occasions when I approached them regarding the poor quality of rare beef pho I was served. I was told they could offer me a new meal but that I would be charged for the meal I felt was no good - WHAT?! How is this a solution? I did not mention the below par pieces of meat consisting of mainly bone and the measly scraps of vegetable my husband was served. Then when I made a fuss about having to pay despite food that was not up to par, the waitress (glasses, young looking, ombre hair) angrily and rudely took my plate and walked away without addressing me any further. After she returned with my new order (which was cold may I add), she continued to look very rudely toward my family and I. Not the environment anyone would feel comfortable in. We left unhappy with both the service and our meals. 
I will not be returning to this establishment despite investing as a devout customer initially."}
{"text":"The sign said open 11:00 pm  we came 10:30 pm as soon as we pull up the waitress  turn off the open sign said it close we really disappointed the seviced"}
{"text":"Usually really busy during weekend dinner. Our family comes very often and the food is always consistent, the portion size has remained the same since opening (which is awesome), service is fast. 

Definitely recommend their mixed seafood hotpot (comes with 3-4 giant prawns, a dozen or so large shrimp, lots of squid, beef and other seafood and veggies). Their grilled meat platters are amazing too with the lettuce wraps. 

Their pho is good, but we always come back for the grilled dishes."}
{"text":"After experiencing pho places around Mississauga, this is among the top 3.  The soup base is excellent if your having pho.  Vermicelli with pork and spring roll is very good.  Pretty busy place so could be a short wait but turn off is pretty quick.  Very good value. Choice of hot or cold tea served."}
{"text":"Go here regularly.  Best vietnamese restaurant in mississauga.  Unfortunately competition is pretty bad."}
{"text":"Everything is good and big portion too and the price is also ok not too expensive or cheap. The only thing we don't like is the Pho because it lack taste and has not  a lot of flavors. Besides that everything is good on the menu... We come here at least 2 to 3 times a week."}
{"text":"This place used to be call Pho Mi Asia and the food was great, but not sure if they sold it to a new owner or just changed their name.  My family and I went back last week and was surprised to see the name change so I hesitated a bit because I was not sure if the food and quality will still be there but anyway we just gave it  a try.  Anyway, seems like the food still taste as good as the former.  Portions and price are very decent.  Every time I think about Vietnamese food this is the only restaurant I want to eat at.  Just a casual place but who cares, its the taste and quality that matters to me!"}
{"text":"Came back again to try their pho only, not any of the family sharing dishes. Tried their summer rolls, as well as beef flank and rare beef pho. 

The rice paper rolls were pretty good, no complaints there. Came with a good portion of lemongrass chicken inside and was cooked well. On the other hand, the pho that we came to have disappointed. 

We had ordered the rare beef and well done flank pho, but when it came, it had tendons and no flank! Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but not one to eat tendon, I didn't think I had received the right order. Flagging down a waiter to ask, he confirmed that we had ordered exactly. We asked for the pho to be sent back and remade with the correct fillings, which normally should not be a problem. Then the owner/boss lady came and said that we had got what we ordered, even though we were 100% sure it was wrong. She told us to pick out the pieces we didn't want and they would send out the beef we did order. As a business lady, I can understand that each order costs money, but if the order is wrong, it should be fixed!! After arguing back and forth, we grabbed a menu and pointed out exactly what we ordered. It turns out the Vietnamese translation did NOT match the English version. As a result we received what it said it Vietnamese and not English. After realizing her mistake, the lady finally gave in to remaking the bowl of pho and slinked away, shouting at the waiters and cooks after. 

Again the food was okay, but service is really again what brought this experience to a low. ):"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst pho restaurant you could go to. The restuarant is usually too busy to serve you. The service is dog trash and so is the food. I don't think they understand what too much salt is. If you hate yourself, this restuarant is for you."}
{"text":"I've only had the vegetable soup so I can't comment on the pho, but the veggie soup is just perfection!The tofu is delicious and the vegetables taste fresh. They don't add a ton of noodles like they do at other places either. When I feel like something different I ask them to add some tom yum paste (non vegetarian) to give it a nice hot and sour flavour."}
{"text":"My cousin and I went here just to try it out based on the many good reviews.. You guys clearly have never had good vietnamese food in your lives. Holy shit. The pho broth was gross, no flavour and seemed like there was a few missing ingredients. The fresh rolls falls apart as soon as you bite into it and the spring rolls tasted like it frozen packaged spring rolls you by from Walmart. The store however was clean and the young female had okay service. However there was a lot of back and forth yelling in Vietnamese between the staff. Will I ever be back? Nah"}
{"text":"Over cooked noodles in both bon and pad thai. Just big clumps of noodle stuck together. Fresh rolls entirely uninspiring... just lots more uncooked rice noodles (they also arrived well after the main courses were served).  Not likely to go back when there are many better options. Restaurant was very clean and tidy,  though."}
{"text":"My now weekly Pho place. Sorry Pho Mi 99, just too noisy there. The Pho is bang on, not oily and toppings are always fresh & they include some Chinese cilantro which I LOVE!  Most suburban places leave it out. Great friendly staff and surprisingly nice interior. Really clean and modern."}
{"text":"Wow. Blown away by the quality of the food here. New benchmark set! And so close to home!!!! Really angry nobody told me about this place earlier. 

Pho was 5/5, service was 5/5 despite the line up out the door on this particular Sunday afternoon. 

I don't particularly like the smell or taste of fish sauce, but their fried chicken wings with fish sauce were impossibly perfect. Crunchy batter yet super moist on the inside and packed full of umami flavour. I don't like MSG, but I'd break that rule any day for more of my new crack. It's freaking Jesus in a chicken wing!

I had a Durian shake to top off my super Viet meal, and I loved it too! 

A very good reason this pho spot has a line up out the door on the regular! Just don't get between me and my crack!"}
{"text":"Just another Pho place in Mississauga there so many and out of them aren't much better than the other so I'm not sure why they keep opening mind you this place is pretty good. The bowls are a bit smaller then some other places so make sure you order a size up if you're really hungry.  But they have a tasty broth but its nothing compared to Ramen. I'm not sure why Mississauga doesn't have more Ramen places instead of tons and tons of Pho places. There really isn't any reason why I would come here verses any other Pho place.


The Paid Thai was just okay would not order again . There are other Pho places I prefer but at the end of the day I'd much rather have a bowl of Ramen then a bowl of Pho.

Service was not that great they brought all of are food at the same time so they could have their dinner, although I know this is a popular practice at a lot of asian restaurants since the staff all eats together. But I would prefer not to have my meal rushed. I probably will not be back to I Love Pho."}
{"text":"This establishment is formerly Pho Mi Asia...we have been here a couple times before and always come back whenever we are in the area. Its a large restaurant in a hidden corner of a plaza across from Tech Direct. FOOD IS DELICIOUS and authentic...you know this because when you walk in...80% of the patrons are vietnamese. I enjoy the pho, rice dishes, vermicelli..but today I was craving banh xeo and they did not disappoint. For those who have never had it, its basically a tumeric, rice flour and coconut milk crispy crepe with beansprouts shrimp and pork inside served with fresh herbs and fish sauce. It was a big portion, so fragrant and crispy and they do not stinge on the herbs like so many other places do. It was delicious....was drooling when it hit our table (my pics do not do it justice)! I always return...5 stars...one of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants...next time we will try the beef 7 ways dish....mmmm.."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pho place. It is newly renovated and the best item on the menu is #306. It has everything, egg and rice noodle, seafood, shrimp cracker, quail egg, barbecue pork. I call it the works! Service is fast and alchohol is also available."}
{"text":"We tried this place Friday at 5:30 pm. It is a smaller place compared to other pho places. We ordered our usual, rare beef medium size & rare beef & well done beef small size and an order of fried spring rolls. I really liked their tables because it looked like white granite. And their table setup of utensil and condiments was neatly organized but there were little white stuff coming off of the napkins and we had no idea what they were! It went all over our pants and sweater. Finally our soups and spring rolls arrived which wasn't a bad wait. The soup had a lot of flavour. We liked it better than pho mi at latimer drive but not as good as big bowl at dundas. The spring rolls were ok, Pho at latimer have the best spring roll. So overall it was, ok. I dont know if we'll go back because it is a far drive and the experience isnt worth the drive. But if we're in the area maybe."}
{"text":"Used to frequent Pho Dau Bo on Dundas E as my mainstay Mississauga pho for years. However I moved away and during that time my parents updated me that I Love Pho has now taken the cake for best pho in the city.
I arrived on a Sunday evening and there was definitely a lineup, waited about 15min which is unusual for pho in Mississauga I've found. However was it ever worth the wait! The crowd is super Vietnamese, be prepared for lots of fake handbags, wildly painted toenails, and loud sharp voices. The waitstaff speak an obnoxious Northern Viet tone. It's all part of the fun. 
The pho here is definitely the best in the city right now IMO. Great flavor profile with lots of beef taste and just enough msg. 
I haven't had the non-pho dishes so I can't comment on the quality of the menu across the board. I'll come back here for the pho again. 
(on an off note, why is the category of this place listed as \"Asian Fusion\"? That's an insult, this place is super legit. I hope it's not a lame attempt to be in a Yelp category that non-Asians frequent, in order to get hits.)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but I'll round up. Super friendly service, quick, easy on the wallet. We were greeted by their vietnamese servers.

Ordered the pho and pork chop, they did it right! Seasoned and cooked well, not too salty, not too bland. Came in large portions and was very filling towards the end. 

Decor inside is a little bit dated, but overall highly recommended! :)"}
{"text":"As much as I frequent this place and love their noodles (pho and bun), I found the rice subpar.

I ordered a grilled chicken, grilled pork chop, and steamed egg rice. It came with a tangy sauce for dipping, along with a super greasy soup (the same broth used in their pho).

My pork chop came with a generous ladle of oil pooled in the centre. The oil came from the hot oil that they use to cook the scallions and place on top of the meat. However, this very oil made its way all the way down through my rice, causing my rice to be soaked in oil. The rice itself I would have enjoyed, but it was just too much grease.
The egg was interesting, but quite tasty. It had imitation crab and vermicelli noodles inside, and there was an unmistakable aroma of fish sauce.

There were also sanitary issues with my dish. Not only did I find an eyelash in my egg, but there was also a bug in my lettuce. Disgusting."}
{"text":"A new favourite in Mississauga! 

They were pretty busy during the noon rush, but service was quick and food came out in no time. 

Before we even got through the door, they greeted us & asked if we would like hot or cold tea. At least we didn't have to sit around waiting. 

It took every fibre in our bodies to resist ordering Bo 7 mon (Vietnamese seven course beef). We agreed to try out the staples first, and ordered the usual pho & vermicelli. 

The Medium Pho Dac Biet was $6.50 - very hearty in comparison to other pho joints. Unlike Pho Do Thi (which seems to have really gone downhill), they gave us more than 1/3 of a beef ball, with plenty of tripe & tendon. 
Spring rolls were just like how momma makes 'em! 
($3.75 for 2 rolls/ $7 for 4)
Vermicelli was not really anything special, but the ba la lot (minced beef wrapped in grape leaves) is worth mentioning. 

Highlights - cheap, quick, and fresh! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yep. I really love pho. Specifically this pho? Pho sho! But seriously, since moving out of the house for good and losing convenient access to my mothers chicken soup, there is really only one thing I want when I'm feeling a little achy as a flu is gripping my bones - pho! 

And like clockwork each time a polish off a large both of piping hot broth and noodles, I'm drenched in sweat and then before you know it... I'm feeling better! 

I've been reading the praises of ILP for awhile and when a recent stop for a cell phone repair brought me to the same parking lot on the exact day I was feeling crummy I knew it was fate. 

It's a smallish place (which will definitely be steamy in the winter) but the service is no frills and efficient. I ordered a large pho with rare beef and balls.  Their large was $7 and while it wasn't the largest bowl I've seen it was certainly one of the better ones. Next to no oil on the top, the broth fresh and delicious and the noodles cooked perfectly. 

My girlfriend had a tofu and vermicelli noodle dish which she really enjoyed (I still don't get tofu...). 

Overall a great experience and I'll be back many more times as the weather continues to cool down! 

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"It's good and nice! I gave it 3 starts because I probably only had pho which cannot be really extraordinary than a regular one. Overall, it's recommended to go there eat"}
{"text":"Regular customer, really good food. Pho is authentic as it can be for a dining establishment. Other foods like banh xeo and bun thit nuong is good. Any Com tam dishes are good too! Overall a versatile place with decent customer service at an affordable price."}
{"text":"We arrived to the restaurant as needing a table for 3 adults and I saw that there were at least 4 empty tables (the restaurant was not super packed by any means). However, the server working there told us to sit at a table that was quite squishy for 3 adults. It was two tables combined as one with a condiments tray between the two. Two people were seated at the other side of that table with the lady having placed her purse on the chair beside her. We asked the server if we could sit at another table (one that was an individual 4-seater), and her immediate response was, \"that table IS for 3 people\" (said in an unfriendly and rude manner). So we sat down and then were given the menus. As we were sitting, another two female customers come in and the server seats them to the individual 4-seater. At this point, things did not make sense. Why were we, 3 people, seated at a table this cramped up, but the other two were seated at an individual 4-seater? 

We called the server and asked her if we could sit at another 4-seater table. She asked us what's wrong with this table, and we told her that it's too small for 3 adults (as there was a condiments tray basically taking up half of my table space). She turned and looked at the table behind her as there were still dishes that she had to clean up. She thought for a while, literally a long pause, and said we could sit at another 4-seater that was already cleaned and ready for customers to sit at. After that she's like, \"take the tea with you\" (in once again, a very rude manner). 

The server's attitude and manner was just terrible. It definitely needs to be improved. If the restaurant is full, then it's understandable to sit us at the table we were told to sit at, but when we arrived, there were clearly other tables are available. When we requested, she denied our request right away. 

If it weren't for the food, I would not be coming to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I Love Pho is a great place for lunch. If you can get past the waiting times during peak hours, I Love Pho offers tasty Vietnamese and Thai dishes. The Pho broth has a great flavour to it, though I feel the amount of meat inside the bowl is inadequate. Typically, I order a ride dish however being either grilled porkchops, chicken or the stirfried beef. My favourite thing to get though are the drinks! The red bean coconut milk shake is my absolute favourite, and the three bean shake a close second. They offer a variety of milkshakes, Vietnamese cold coffee and many others. Make sure to try one out with your meal. 

The staff here are typical of your other casual Asian restaurants. Not exactly rude, but have that Asian style of being direct and to the point. Don't expect them to make small talk and ask how your day is. If you aren't used to this you may be taken by surprise but those who frequent Asian joints will know what I'm talking about. Overall, a great place for a cheap and tasty meal. I come here every Sunday when I'm in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Good food. Large portions and good speedy service.  

They speak English and understand what you would like.  Would visit again for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favourite go-to pho place while in Sauga. The decor is nothing to rave about but I do like how clean it is inside. It's rather small so be prepared to wait if you're planning on going during the busy hours. 

It's always been busy every time I go, however, I found myself waiting for only 10-15 mins before getting a table. The order comes quickly, as pho always does. 

The broth of the pho is on point. It's not too salty nor scream of pure MSG. It has the right flavour of the beef and their noodles are good. 

Parking can be tight when it's busy so you may have to park at the other side of the plaza."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese places that I have eaten at!  Get the grilled pork app!  Booom"}
{"text":"My Vietnamese coworker has been raving about this place and that his family comes at least once a week. We were in the area today and had a chance to grab lunch. The restaurant is located in a busy plaza but parking is plentiful. 

The restaurant is spacious with enough seating. The tables seems to cater to larger groups. The place is busy but seating opens up fairly quickly. The restaurant's washrooms are small but clean. 

We ordered the Pho House Special, Bun Bo Hue and the Grilled Pork Chop with Shredded Pork, Rice and Vegetables. Each dish came in large portions. The prices were fair. Service is attentive enough as you shouldn't expect to trade pleasantries with the waitstaff. You write down your order, they pick it up and bring you the food. Make sure that you inform them whether you want tea or cold water in between those interactions. Otherwise, they don't come to your table to see how is your meal. Each dish was seasoned correctly as this place does Pho right! 

If we have a craving for Pho and we are in Mississauga, this will be our first choice. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm usually hesitant to try new pho restaurants but my boyfriend kept insisting so we went to I Love Pho. We came on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. I ordered a rice dish and he got a vermicelli bowl and they were both delicious. We decided to try their family dinner dishes the week after. We got the sweet and sour prawn soup and marinated fish in clay pot. These are very traditional Vietnamese dinner dishes so it's rare to find them cooked well at a pho restaurant but the chef here made it perfectly! I'm Vietnamese and growing up, my mom makes these all the time so I was really excited to finally find a place that makes it so well. It was so delicious we ordered them again the following week. Although the service is a little slow here it's completely understandable considering how busy they are. We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Best pho in Mississauga, good price, great food, a lot of choice and food is authentic. Service is ok comparing to the price. It was so busy and we got there closed to 9pm. People still we're coming Ng in while we were eating. So you can tell the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"The pho here is good. Both the meat and vegetables tasted fresh. The broth was a bit bland compared to most other pho places in town. I would have rated this place higher if not for the service. There is definitely room for improvement for their customer service."}
{"text":"Great place! Good quality/price. Our family visited I love Pho twice in two days; We were visiting Mississauga. I would strongly recommend to order com tam for only 7.00$!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pho places in Mississauga. Pho broth has great flavour and their meat is always fresh! You can taste a huge difference compared to other pho places."}
{"text":"Simple name for a simple place. Straight to the point which is what I like! Say it with me... I . LOVE. PHO.  Yes.. say it again.. I. LOVE. PHO! Now say it in your best Jerry Mcguire voice... I LOVE PPPHHHHOOO!!!!

This place lives up to its name. If you love Pho...make sure you come check it out because this place is Phobolous! There was line up that moved fairly quickly. The broth was Photastic! The service was on point and I will definitely be coming back here PhoSho!"}
{"text":"As a Vietnamese person, I feel like I'm quite judgemental. Not because I'm only use to my own family cooking, but because I've tried a s-load of vietnamese dishes cooked by different people from here to Vietnam. 

This particular place was okay. We ordered the Bo 7 mon (7 styles of beef) , spring rolls, and a rice dish with everything in it. 

The beef course came with a lot of food, It was well worth it -price alone! 

Food however, 
1.  rare beef slices came in a very small portion but was quite good when cooked in the spicy stock (it's quite spicy!). You roll it up with the rice paper and put whatever toppings you wish inside. The sauce it came with to dip was on the sweeter side than I'd like but still tasty! 
2. Bo nuong la lot - the beef roll in leaf was soggy and oily, however had good flavours. 
3. Beef congee was great, more on the runny side than thick. 
4. Bo luc lac - shaken beef - was Chewy but great flavours
5. Grilled beef slices were dry and chewy 
6. Bo tai chanh - the pale pieces of beef lol- had great flavour. Love that they use lime leaves and cilantro to bring out the flavours. It was a little too cooked for my liking. I usually have it rare like a beef tataki 
7. Meatball had same flavour as the one rolled in la lot -leaves - without the leaves lol 

Spring rolls - typical spring rolls 
Rice dish - typical with grilled beef and the fixings 

Drinks : do not get bubble tea unless you like the powder stuff. The soda xi muoi had too much sugar in it. The Che 3 mau was half ice and had no liquids in it ! 

Will I come back for these specific dishes? Nah. If I'm super duper craving it, maybe I'll come and order it..then regret eating it after... then be glad again once the cheap bill comes. Lol"}
{"text":"Small place. Great food and prices.  I ordered a special pho 201 and spring rolls.  Large was surprisingly filling.  Good portions.  
I felt the noodles were a bit soft and overcooked a tad.  I like mine chewy.
Definitely would come back.

Venue 4.5/5
Food 4.5/5
Service 4/5
Price 5/5"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I've been to at least 15 different pho places in Toronto, and I've found two that I love.  This is one of them. The other is at Western Rd and Finch Ave.

In my opinion, its all about the soup base.  The flavor has to be there, yet low in MSG taste.  If you go home after eating and become very thirsty, then that restaurant uses too much MSG.  

We went on a Saturday for lunch, it was a full house.  After a 5-10min wait, got our table.   The place was very clean, even the washrooms.  I ordered the beef & chicken pho, which is a neat combo of meat types.   THe best of both worlds.  My friends ordered lemongrass chicken on verm.  Also very delicious.  

I look around and other Vietnamese customers were eating a nice full course meal, one where you wrap your OWN rolls using rice paper.  It comes with a paper holder with water where they dip the paper in and rotate it to wet the round rice paper.  Then wrap their own ingredients.  Now that's authentic eating.  I'm gonna try that next time.

The large was $8, and it was full of meat.  Not like other places where large just means more noodles and not more meat.   They also gave a nice sized amount of bean sprouts and greens.  That's always a good sign when you don't have to ask for a 2nd plate of greens.

I'm totally satisfied, clean place, so 5 stars.  I can see nothing they can improve on.  Maybe buy next door and make the restaurant bigger?? haha.."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm and it was packed! Even around 2pm when we were leaving, there was still a lineup so that's always a good sign. The restaurant is pretty small with about 10-12 tables so for our party of 6 we waited about 15-20 minutes and the layout is terrible, you are pretty much jammed near the entrance while waiting. The actual restaurant itself was however clean and tidy.

Our group ordered several bowls of pho, steamed rice rolls with ground pork, and fresh rolls with shrimp and pork. Loved the rolls, both were so fresh and tasty! The soup broth was decent, it was warm, not too oily but maybe needed a little more flavour (does not compare to Pho Metro in Scarborough!) The meat to noodle ratio was adequate. Price is average for a small bowl of pho it was $7 and for a large $9 so comparable to other pho places.

Service was below average but that's what you typically expect at an asian restaurant, no communication, just give you your food, eat quick and get out. 

Overall, this restaurant is fairly decent. I would come back here if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Man, portions here are huge here. I got the bun (vermicelli) and I could barely finish. 

Food quality is pretty good too. Nothing out of the ordinary in terms of Viet, but I'm giving this place 4 stars for bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars, but will round up to 4 since it's the holidays.  

I came here after going to the gym and ordered a medium veggie pho and fresh tofu rolls.  

The pho was large, had plenty of veggies and was reasonably priced.  In terms of the veggie rolls, these were definitely fresh and contained tofu and romaine lettuce.  

Two downsides to this place: Parking can be tough at nights as there seemed to be a lot of people going to Wacky Wings and the servers can be kind of well, not rude, but abrupt.  I tried saying thank you a few times when they delivered my dishes and I was basically ignored.  I almost felt like I was a hassle.  I hate feeling this way.

Would I visit again? Yes, probably since it's on my way home from work, but not somewhere I'd venture out to specifically for good pho."}
{"text":"First time ordering something else other than pho at a pho restaurant! I ordered a Bánh xèo and it took a while to come out even when my friend ordered grilled meat on rice. So they're half way done when my food arrives. It was good even tho I have nothing to compare it too. It is on the lighter side i guess, definitely a healthy alternative.

I asked for more lettuce and they said they'll charge extra, which is no problem except that it never came and they wrapped it to go.....

They have a lot of servers at lunch but i felt like service was slow still. I'll come again to try the pho :)"}
{"text":"This place always has a line up.  Everyone we have taken to this place also love it now.  We have tried multiple items on the menu and we always have a good experience.  Food is good, affordable and service is quick!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested to try their 7 beef course meal. It was amazing ! The beef was cooked and presented in 7 different ways - hot pot, rice wraps, noodles and vegetables wraps.  The set course is for 2 people - minimum order. 

The second time I came back for their pho. Yum yum for the tum tum. The broth was delicious and had enough meat. 

The third I came here tried their vermicelli- beef dish. It did not disappoint either. 

The avocado slush was a bit on the sweet side and otherwise it was good. 

Friends ordered the Vietnamese ice coffee - they said it's the best one they had in the city."}
{"text":"Came here for pho and the broth had like almost no taste, was disappointed because I was told this place had good pho. The rice dishes here are actually better than the pho, so if you want a tasty and favorable pho than I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The excitement over the new pho restaurant in Mississauga spread in my household like wildfire. My uncle who probably frequents his favorite Vietnamese restaurant that serves up hot delicious beefy noodle soup goodness at least 3-4 times a week told my brother and me about it two weeks ago. 

My brother then proceeded to go try it out and went back another 2 times last week @_@ after he talked about it I had to go.

Went on a Sunday afternoon for a small snack with my uncle. Big mistake... no such thing. We ordered the shredded pork fresh rolls, the shrimp and pork pancakes (ban xeo), the rice rolls and ham (Ban Cuon) and the tripe porridge, plus an extra avocado shake for me...

I was so stuffed at the end I had to be rolled out into the pouring rain...

The avocado shake was good, creamy and not too sweet. The pancakes were extra crispy outside and tasty but could definitely use more shrimp and pork on the inside. The veggies it came with to wrap was fresher than fresh. The porridge was loaded with internal organ goodness and had a great taste...fyi not too much msg.

Then everything took a different turn...

The ban coun we never got because it was sold out but for some reason took 3 shots at communicating this to us. We reminded the male owner? at one point about it after we finished our first 2 dishes and he said okay it's coming out. At one point the server(female owner?) came and she started taking away our chopsticks and fish sauce and I was like no we're not done, we're still waiting for the rice noodles and porridge. She said no you only have porridge left so you don't need chopsticks. I said no we ordered ban coun as well... she cleared it anyways and came back with our bill where it doesn't say rice noodles... :/ The male owner? came over and said oh yea they ordered it but we're sold out... -_- thanks for the notice... I wasn't specifically overjoyed with this part of their service because not only did they not apologize, they just walked away after this revelation like we inconvenienced them...

Worse of all, after all that while we were eating our porridge a large group came in and they loudly sat them at the table next to us and gestured to our table and said this table is yours too. So then we just had a family of 6-7 standing next to our table while we were trying to finish eating... Not cool. Diners should wait at the front or the door until full seating is ready, not standing awkwardly next to people while they eat and know they're \"holding\" people up. 

Horrible practice... I might go back to try their pho or beef 7 ways hot pot but definitely not going anytime soon over my other pho favorites."}
{"text":"After seeing countless good reviews of the place, I finally decided to give it a try.

Let me just premise that my family LOVES Pho.  Coming from Vietnamese/Filipino background (weird , I know) we've made it our mission to try pretty much every major pho location out there (my top places so far are the pho dao bo on dundas and stanfield, as well as the Pho Hung, just down the street).

I must say that my expectations were rather high.  Being a non-franchised Pho shops, I immediately assumed the worse and had written it off.  It actually wasn't until I saw the constant raving reviews on yelp that it popped up on my radar, and a random hungry stomach pushed me over the edge.

Coming into the store I immediately noticed 2 things:  1.  The establishment was small and a little messy (waiters and customers were constantly bumping into each-other trying to move around), and 2. The small little messy place was full.  That being said my partner and I found an empty table and quickly snatched it before anyone else had the chance.  

I ordered a Large sized Pho with the fixings:rare beef with tendon(would've liked if they would throw in a meatball for an additional charge), with Ashley sharing with me. We also ordered a mango shake for her(I think they were out of avocado...huh) and a vietnamese coffee for myself.

The food was surprisingly good.   It was on the salty side - which I liked,  the soup was flavourful and they provided a good amount of meat. (Not tendon, meat.  I'll talk about the tendon in just a bit).  The food (just the food) came quite quickly given how busy the place was. The shake was par and the coffee was strong (as expected!)  Also the prices were pretty moderate.  Much better than what I had originally expected.  I will definitely need to come back to try my favourite vietnamese dish, vermicelli .

As good as the food was, there were a few downsides:

- the large sized bowl (if I remember correctly) was not as big as the large size bowl is not the same size as the other places.  
- I feel like they kind of skimped on the tendon.  I usually expect a little slab, which is then melted and stirred into the soup.  The one I received was already stirred in, and seemed to be lacking.
- The noodles were slightly undercooked, in that they had a some chew when I bit down.
- The vietnamese coffee I ordered took nearly the entire meal to arrive. 

Overall it was a good experience.  I'm conflicted as it's super busy, but super convenient.  

Maybe I'll take the rest of the family to see what they think before giving a full review."}
{"text":"Meh...

Ordered the 201 which is their house special pho. Appearance-wise it has other Mississauga pho establishments beat - the varieties of beef were arranged nicely on top of the bed of noodles. 

Next came the soup test... At my go-to places (Golden Turtle), I hardly add any other sauces cause the broth is that flavourful... Not the case here. I had to add quite a bit of hoisin sauce, which I don't mind at all, but just something to note...

Beef cuts were decent, nothing special. 

Also ordered the fresh spring rolls with shrimp and pork as well as one of the vermicelli dishes. Both were just decent as well. 

Nothing really wow'd me with this pho restaurant. If I had to pick, I'd say that the interior was the most impressive aspect of my experience. It was spotless white all around, and there was a TV that customers could enjoy. The service was also quite pleasant.

I'll be back to try other dishes, but that first experience was nothing better than just alright."}
{"text":"I go to Pho Mi Asia (I Love Pho 2) after I drop of my son at work in Mississauga on Sunday mornings at 10am. They are one of the few pho places open at that time.
My wife is Vietnamese and she recommends this place and I understand why. The food is authentic, delicious and comes out hot. The prices are good and the place has a nice airy ambience and is quite clean.
Now, the service is not the friendliest as the servers are quite kurt but they are efficient. Just typical Vietnamese restaurant level service."}
{"text":"My Baes and I eat Pho at least once a week throughout Mississauga. We find the Pho Restos in West Sauga mediocre at best and are always on the lookout for something new to try.  So, as usual, I find myself Yelping and come across I Love Pho. With a Yelp classification of  Hot and New?!   
Well it is Sunday (Phoday) so I say to Bae Mamy that after shopping we be having a late lunch at I Love Pho.  We arrive at approx two o'clock.  The Resto is at thirty percent capacity.  Nicely furnished. Clean. A cozy restaurant. 
Order:  two Pho -Well Done Beef, one small Cha Gio and one Broken Rice Grilled Chicken/Pork, steamed and fried egg shredded pork entree. Plus an extra Grilled Pork Chop to wash it all down with. 
Pho- Well Done Beef. I always start with the broth of the Pho. Hmmmm. Relatively clear and clean in appearance. Taste: not to salty, not too fish saucy, not to sweet, not to too weak in flavour but good to say the least.  Lol. The rice noodles are thin.  That is new to me.  Now I am not the type to add anything to my Pho except basil, sprouts, lime and one slightly bruised chilli pepper and that long narrow green leaf.  Someone tell me what that leaf is.  I remember buying it from B Trust but can't remember the name of it!?!?!!!  I mix everything and re taste the broth. I found it to be a bit weak but still good. The Well Done beef reeled the dish in. Tender lightly fatty thinly sliced beef goodness. The Restos use of thin rice noodles was a nice touch. 
Now to the Broken Rice Entree. The grilled chicken and pork. OMGoodness. Deliciousness. It is a must order.  Only issue is that I wish the piece of Chicken and pork was bigger.  Glad I ordered the extra piece of Grilled Pork. Steamed egg was delicious. Chopped that fried egg and runny yolk  into the broken rice, add the Nuoc Cham (fish sauce) Sirrach and Hoisin - BOOM!!!!!!!!  We all share and take turns with each other's plates.
Lastly the Cha Gio aka Deep Fried Spring Rolls. Most Viet Restos give you this oil drenched mess however, I Love Pho's Cha Gio was nothing near oily. It was really delicious. Crispy and virtually oil free. I even tried eating it Korean Style by wrapping one piece with the plate garnish, lettuce leaf,  and stuffing it with the other plate garnish, noodles and the pickled radish/carrot. Topped it all with Sirrach and Nuoc ,,, Ssam anyone? Someone tell me if the Vietnamese or anybody else rock it like that too. Is there a Vietnamese Dish similar to Ssam?  Ohya, clean cozy  washrooms. Lol. Peace out Yelpers."}
{"text":"Really liked their rice dish!

We came here at about 10pm. Maybe that's why they served us hot tea in plastic cups with no handles.. I asked the waitress for some tea cups, and was told they don't have any.
Also, when we asked her some questions about the dishes and menu she didn't know anything and kept having to go ask her manager.

Anyways, we ordered fried spring rolls, cold pork rolls, a bowl of pho, and a rice combo platter. The spring rolls were pretty good, your average vietnamese rolls. The cold rolls were VERY bad. The worst I've ever had. The \"pork\" is this shredded pork made up of mostly noodles (should be re-named \"pork flavored noodles\"). We told the waitress, and once again, back to the manager, who took the rolls off our bill. 
My rice dish was actually pretty good! I was pleasantly surprised. I got grilled chicken, pork chop, fried egg, steamed egg, shredded pork, rice, and a small bowl of soup. The only other place I've ever known to give you this much was Red Papaya in Guelph (whom has closed down as of now, replaced with numerous other restaurants one after the other). I was happy with this!
The pho was decently sized, came with a variety of meats, but a very small amount of each. It had ONE very small beef ball in it.

All in all, their rice dish saved them. I'll only be coming back when I crave pork chops and rice. :)"}

Food: 9.5/10

Service: 9/10
Value: 9/10
Hygiene: 9/10
Aesthetics: 8/10

Finding places for pho is always good, finding places that serve good pho is better. This place serves good pho.

For a starter, I had the salad rolls, they were excellent, wrapped properly so that everything didn't just fall out. The house special pho had a clean flavour, the spices weren't overly potent and it didn't leave the taste of umami on the palate. The avocado shake was great and flavourful, just the right amount of sweetness.

The cost is typical of Vietnamese food around $7-10/entree. The quality and portions are great. 

It has a very standard, it's tucked away in the corner with large windows. Nothing particularly standout. The place is clean, the utensils were clean, and not greasy.

The service here was very fast and courteous.

A great place for Vietnamese food. I would definitely recommend this place. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, it's my go-to pho place! I literally come by every chance I get. Everything is clean and tidy, fast service and quality foods! Every time a bowl of pho passes by you just smell all the wonderful flavours and it is just so comforting. The broth itself is so delightful and light. Not too greasy, it's just comfort in a bowl. The only thing I would say is an issue is parking. It's hard to find parking on a busy day but that has not stopped me from getting my bowl of pho. 100% would recommend to friends, and have!"}
{"text":"New place look alot more modern. A little bit smaller then the previous locations. But pho still pretty solid meal. Stil come with alot of meat. Customer is very rush because they are always so busy. But everything comes out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday to try out for the first time.  I kept hearing many of my friends going here and recommending it.

I have been to this location before when it was previously a Thai restaurant. I remembered the interior to be small with limited seating, and dark decor.
When I first stepped into the new pho restaurant it was completely different in a good way!  The renovations made the restaurant a lot more bright and airy.

The tables were about half full when we went.  Shortly after we got our food it started getting packed with every table taken.

The service was very fast and friendly.  We got our food quickly and it tasted fresh.  We ordered the spring rolls, pho, and a dry egg noodle dish.  The pho was good in my opinion.  My husband thought it could be a bit more flavourful.  Also the noodles were a tad bit over cooked for our liking, as we like our pho noodles on the chewier side.

Prices are reasonable and average for a pho place.  2 spring roll were about $3.  Pho around $8.

Overall good and will be coming back."}
{"text":"After months of driving past this place... The new pho restaurant opened!
The sign is very noticeable and lit up compared to the previous restaurant that was here. The decor is new and fairly modern and they have two TVs. It is quite a small spot so seating is fairly limited compared to the other competitors in Mississauga. 
As we entered the restaurant on a late Sunday night,  we were greeted quickly and picked our seats.  There were still some occupied tables and as we enjoyed our meal,  a few more people came in along with people ordering take out. 
The service was great as we got our tea quickly,  as well as our food.  The server asked how were doing and I believe the owner... asked how we liked the  broth... Super important I'd say for a pho restaurant. I am no Vietnamese food connoisseur but the soup was tasty but did not make me thirsty- often other pho places make me thirsty cause of the msg.
Glad to see that the owner works hard and looks for feedback..thumbs up! 
In terms of their food selection, they have a wide variety on their menu,  similar to other Viet restaurants. 
We also tried their summer rolls with grilled pork.. It was delicious! I only had 2 bites since I was super full from the noodles.. Very generous noodle portion for a small:) Price is also fair imo. 

Overall, I am a fan and I'm sure I'll be visiting again to try their other dishes. 

Ps- Be sure to stop by this month for their grand opening special! Try this new sauga place out!"}
{"text":"Big portions, fast service and good prices. Tried a couple of the soups and Buns (grilled chicken, beef with lemongrass) and would definitely recommend all of them. Consistently very delicious."}
{"text":"Came back here a few more times since my first visit.

Have had their grilled pork and beef wrapped in wild betel leaves with vermicelli.  Can be summed up in 4 words:

Abso-f**king-lutely to die for. (yes, I used a Mr. Big word from Sex and the City, I'm ok with my sexuality to quote from this show - deal with it!)

It's a shame not many other Vietnamese restaurants offer this, the grilled beef wrapped in wild betel leaves, or in Viet: bo la lot. 

I have a strong feeling it's fresh and made in-house, as being this my favourite Vietnamese item, I know a frozen beef wrapped in betel leaves when I see one.  It's often dry and almost hard to bite into but not here, not at I Love Pho. It's moist and flavorful, damnit and leaves (haha, no pun intended) you wanting even more!!!

That in itself has guaranteed me as a customer for a long time!  And oh, they make a mean Vietnamese condensed milk iced coffee too!"}
{"text":"I've had the chicken, rare beef both very good.  Nice broth, white meat, good quality.  Only thing i didn't like bbq w egg noodle.  Won't try that again."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant a lot due to their services and the food quality. However, I am very disappointed for a few recent visits. Since the waiters and waitress had been changed lately, the service quality was reduced drastically. 

Simply for the visit today, the restaurant was not full at all. I had been seated by a waiter. Two customers came after me, so the waiter requested me to move to another table. Come on, there were so many empty tables around, I don't understand his cause.

When the two person were served tea, no one approached me for drink (normally they will serve tea without asking for it). I requested it and the waiter gave me pure water instead. 

On the fork they provided, I found a piece of paper stuck on it.

Again, if today was full of customers, I would've tried to calm myself down. Unfortunately, all of things above happened to the restaurant I visited pretty everyday."}
{"text":"My boss always orders take out from here and it's so authentic with all the herbs and flowers.  I love the bun bo hue.   I have yet to try their shrimp rolls cha muc. Supposedly it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"I go here often for take out..they have pretty decent non greasy seafood noodle soup."}
{"text":"Great little gem.  The menu is huge - it is a booklet!  I don't know how they could make that many things in their small kitchen.  However, the food comes out hot and fresh and delicious.  They are open a little later than other places in the neighborhood, so it is good for late night eats.  The Pho is authentic and the prices are cheap in comparison to other Pho places.  They take all forms of payment and are not in a rush to get you out.  Great food, great prices, convenient location."}
{"text":"Like this place, the BBQ pork is tasty and not so greasy as  Pho mi 99's. There avocado milk shake is good too. I've noticed quite a few customers ordered it. Service is good, fast, staff is polite. Weekend seems a bit busy though, the restaurant is not very big but comfy enough to eat in. Not pricy, will come this place again."}
{"text":"Portions here are definitely huge, but the service is definitely lacking. 

They have all the typical Vietnamese dishes, which are all very good. My family, who is of Vietnamese origin, loves coming here first for the portions and second because of the quality. I find there is nothing that really pops for the taste though and can be a bit bland at times. 

The service here can definitely be improved. My family and I have been ignored several times when wanted to ask for more tea, but I guess the quantity of food makes it up. 

Definitely when we're in the area - this is our go-to Viet restaurant. However, if you're coming for quality and service, I would recommended elsewhere."}
{"text":"Somehow the west gets pho right. This is yet another addition to an already strong pho lineup in the area. After hearing raving reviews from family and friends I knew I had to visit.

It was a typical Sunday evening yet the atmosphere is anything but. Inside there is an intoxicating Chinese hotplate aroma that fills the air as about a dozen of folks waited in the vestibule. The wait was uncomfortably crowded and that aroma makes the wait even more difficult to endure but nonetheless not a single soul gave up. This is the sign of a good place.

I am predictable as I typically go with my go-to pho. The broth was rich with depth, flavours and not overly salty. Noodles are done just about right, slightly underdone. Generous amounts of beef but could use better quality cuts however this is very typical of pho places. I can't say it's the best pho out there but it's certainly one worthy of the upper echelon of phos in this town. The spring rolls have a fantastic filling but the wrapper is questionable. While it's crispy and all, it differs than the traditional Vietnamese ones I am accustomed to -- the rice wrappers. I would give a pass on these.

All in all, yet another quality place out west to enjoy a good bowl of pho. I will be back for sure...maybe next time for that hotplate!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place for many years. Originally it was called pho mi asia. All the standard viet dishes can be found here. Since changing their name to I Love Pho they now take credit cards as well. (Previously cash/debit only)
Pho broth is always good here and when I order mine with soft tendon they're always generous with the protein. Bánh xèo is always good here and it's never greasy. 
Food is generally inexpensive as is the case with most viet places. 
Note that this restaurant is right next to a pokemon go pokestop."}
{"text":"This is the other I Love Pho in Mississauga. Probably one of my favourite Viet places to eat. The vermicelli with shrimp on sugar cane, pork meatballs and spring rolls are great. All the soups here are great and they even have Bún mm here which you won't always find at Viet restaurants. The only drawback is the small number of tables in this restaurant. Often we drive by and see people outside waiting for a table. So we head for the nearest Viet place instead."}
{"text":"The Pho was great, a little bland, but flavorful.  The basil and sprouts were amazingly fresh and crisp.  Not as crowded or noisy as Pho 99 which is a nice change.  Definitely would come back!!"}
{"text":"Good food, cheap eats. I go here at least once a week. This week I went 3x. My go to is either the banh xeo (large, crispy, lots of fresh herbs) or the self-wrap bo la lot. I tried the bo 7 mon (beef 7 ways) yesterday and it was delicious. If you plan on going, try to get in before the dinner rush at 7pm - or else you'll be waiting for a table. Food comes out hot and fast."}
{"text":"Was a regular customer here as the food was very tasty speaking as a Viet person. However my impression changed drastically when I learned the cook staff as being very unsanitary, example not cleaning hands when taking smoke breaks or going to washroom. As well they have a rodent infestation problem throughout that's affecting the rest of that plaza. So nasty."}
{"text":"This place has been in my bookmarks for awhile.  I couldn't wait to come here as my friend wouldn't stop raving about it.

Place was poppin when we got there and there were no tables available.  My friend assured me the turnaround times were quick and that we wouldn't wait long.  She was right.  We waited maybe 10 minutes or less, then a table became available.  Service was pretty quick.  I mean obvz, I'm only ordering pho, how long could that possible take?  My other friend ordered the stir fried noodles with beef.  His took a little longer.

Pho was pretty fragrant.  I did enjoy the broth. They give you a lot of meat compared to other places but not enough noodles, i found.  I was still full after consuming everything.  I had a few bites of the stir fried noodles and they were delicious!  I really enjoyed this and it was a healthy portion. I would defs order this for myself next time.  I would also get the pho again.  The sucky part was the mango shake I got.  Ugh, not good at all.  It was not sweet and it barely had any mango flavour.  I drank half and left the rest there.  I didn't want to waste my calories on a blah drink.  My friends got the avocado and strawberry shake.  I tried a bit of the avocado and that was pretty on point.  My other friend said the strawberry was good too."}
{"text":"This is a really nice restaurant! Probably my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in the GTA or Mississauga. The Beef 7 Ways is a must try here (I don't understand how people can not feel full after eating this... You're supposed to wrap all the meat and veggies in the rice paper, folks!). They have other good dishes, including some Chinese-Vietnamese dishes that look appealing though I've never tried them. It's a good value restaurant too, like most Vietnamese restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE! Very clean and bright inside. Full house for lunch with mostly Vietnamese clientele, which I love - totally authentic food akin to anything I have come to enjoy from my travel throughout Vietnam. 

Prices were very cheap for very generous portions of very high quality. I was thoroughly satisfied through and through. I'm not sure if they have high chairs for kids as I was just in for takeout. Takeout was very quick. 

Service was very friendly as well. They also accept ApplePay."}
{"text":"Came here after 8pm on a Sunday and it was still super packed and we had to wait for a table. The service was standard except for this one server who kept giving us the side-eye and ignoring our requests for NO REASON since the moment we came in. It was legit the first time we've stepped into this place and I have no clue who this guy is--whyyyyyyyyy?! What did I do to earn your contemptuous glances, mister??

Anyways, the food is actually quite good. The bun bo hue (spicy vermicelli in soup) was delicious and the pho and broken rice with assorted meats were also tasty. The cha gio (fried spring rolls) were just decent, nothing too special.

I really want to come back and try the ba la lot and the other dry vermicelli dishes, but that one server scares me... Such a weird dining experience I don't even know. 

Try this place out I guess?? Maybe make sure to come in NOT looking anything like me haha"}
{"text":"This place is bang on! 4.5/5  Cheap prices, fast service, friendly staff, and tasty dishes!

The place can accomodate approx. 25-30 people. Whenever i come here it is packed but the turn over rate is fast! I never see anyone waiting by the door. I would recommend looking at the beef noodle section and their rice dishes as well. Whenever i come here, i either order the beef brisket in soup and noodle dish (pho) or if I'm craving something with rice i go for their grilled pork chop with fried egg for only $7.00. you can't go wrong with that. Tea always comes as soon as they sit you, either cold or hot.  

They're missing half a star for me because their spring rolls isn't the traditional yellow deep fried crispy spring rolls that most vietnamese restaurants serve, and it lacks a bit of flavour for me. Other than that their hearty pho dishes is light and refreshing with tender pieces of beef. The rice dishes never disappoints me, and anything with a fried egg on top is a plus!"}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase. This place has nice staff but the food is average at best. I am viet myself and been to many viet resto over my long career. Sadly, the food is kinda mediocre. They attempt to re-create many popular viet dishes but they dont have it right just yet. Perhaps with more time and experience, their cooks can sort out this problem. I sadly would not come again but I am suggesting that people wait until this place matures a bit more."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is really.... clean. That was the first thing I noticed during my first visit when it opened sometime last year. Management has kept this place spic and span, and overall, it has a decent setup. The space is used wisely, with a good amount of seating, and in addition to good aesthetics, the place is run by very friendly staff and food is priced reasonably. It's also a good spot to bring my parents for pho, where cleanliness of a restaurant is probably my mother's biggest priority (honestly, if a place is clean, she automatically thinks the food is good).

But, this isn't my mother's review. And to be honest, personally, while the place is nice to look at, the food is nothing more than average. I've had the pho, the deep fried spring rolls, the vermicelli bowl with veggies and spring rolls, among other dishes. It's really nothing spectacular, but its not terrible either. The broth is fresh and decent but isn't over-the-top in terms of flavour, and the vermicelli bowl can be a little bland. 

It isn't my favourite spot for pho in Mississauga - if you're looking for flavour and above-average tastiness, you may want to go elsewhere. But, overall, it's adequate - a solid 3."}
{"text":"What I like about this restaurant is probably their grilled chicken steak rice dish with fried eggs. They serve two (but small) eggs in the dish and the chicken is cooked very tenderly. You would think this restaurant may be an outlier compared to Golden Turtle or Pho99 but this place can definitely be another restaurant choice to go to if you want to change it up from those other competition.

Apart from that, their noodle pho selections are good and also comparable to your local pho or chain places as well!

I also get the coconut milk shake and that is usually very tasty too :) a nice way to compliment the dinner during the summer days!"}
{"text":"I frequently go to the original location on Burnhamthorpe, but decided to come here since it was closer to Sherway Gardens. We came on a Monday around 9pm and were the only ones in the restaurant. I ordered Bun Rieu and was utterly disgusted by the amount of oil in the bowl. I skimmed the bowl and collected 3 small sauce dishes of oil (see pictures). Ended up not eating it at all. 

On top of the already disgusting dish, they had the audacity to blare loud music about 30 minutes in clearly to try to rush us out. The place supposedly closes at 11pm! This place is a HUGE disappointment for the I Love Pho chain. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"One of the best Pho in the city, they really got me!
I ordered the steam rice with pork shop and grill chicken, the best part, was the small soup on the side and the size of the shops, the flavor was also amazing !
I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We couldn't even get seated! 

Came here in a group of 3 and waited over half-an-hour for a table, but the staff continued to seat other groups who arrived after us. We complained to one of the staff members who attempted to speak to a group who was mistakenly seated before us, but of course they did not want to get up after having already been seated. We left before we could waste any more time here.

Very disorganized - they should have had some kind of system to assign numbers to those waiting in line, to keep track of the customers' order of arrival."}
{"text":"Probably the best Vietnamese restaurant right now in Mississauga. The food is cheap and delicious, and it's very consistent in flavor (unlike other Pho restaurants, where it's either bland or very salty). I love eating here at lunch or on Friday/Saturday nights. Highly recommend ordering 'Bun Bo Hue' , their 'Specialty Pho' or Grilled Chicken Vermicelli with Spring Rolls and Veggies."}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed today
My pork was kind of burned with the black stuff around it. They should clean their grill a bit so the burn stuff won't stick to the new food.

And my gf's topings were getting smaller portion on her noodle soup

We also had their vietnamese coffee and for some reason the taste weren't the same as the golden turtle vietnamese coffee. I think golden turtle coffee won...."}
{"text":"I Love Pho. It's a small place located in a plaza along Burnhamthorpe and Mavis. Love their noodle soup and their spring roll. The portions are bigger too as compared to other pho resto & so it's nice for take out."}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation from a Vietnamese friend. 

The place and food are amazing. 

I ordered a medium well done brisket, food came within 5 minutes and had the option between cold and hot tea. (I really liked that) 

The soup was nice and salty, may be too salty for some, the beef was good quality with some tendon. 

Will definitely come here everytime I'm in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese food spot in Mississauga. Being an international student from Hanoi, Vietnam, I'd been eating authentic Vietnamese food every day in my life. The food was good. I tried the Pho but however, it's Southern Pho so I'm not sure how authentic it was, but the flavor was 85% there. The broken rice was great, good flavor and tastes just like in Vietnam. The bun bo hue, however, was not really legit and somewhat tastes like tom yum (??). The staffs were really friendly and helpful. 
Overall, I'd still recommend this place and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"ILP is still a favorite in my books- still a nice spot to visit for well-priced Vietnamese food. I have noticed that recently the pho broth is a little greasier than I would like, but it is still tasty. The service here is fast-paced but it's not rude at all, I actually find it friendly given. I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Minus points 'cause they need to work on their customer service.  True, a bowl of pho is only $6, but c'mon!  Doesn't mean that you can be rude/impatient to patrons when they have not been rude to you.

The friendly male owner was not present during my visit tonight.  However, I hope he reads this and re-trains some of his staff.  I mean pho is good, but I'm sure many patrons will be turned off if the service continues to be slack and dismissive.

My mom was in the middle of changing her order on the receipt when a younger male server came, snatched up the paper while she was writing, shook his head and kissed his teeth.  I found that very rude.

Also at the end of our meal, we asked him for a takeout box, he just walked away, no acknowledgment whatsoever, and brings the container later.  Sure, he provided what was asked of him, but I found this particular server unnecessarily disrespectful.

If the owner is reading this, sir, please check up on your staff!  If people don't return, it's probably due to the poor service."}
{"text":"Their fresh spring rolls are good, but their rice dishes are disappointing! Just like the vermicelli, the chicken had too much fat and the fish sauce is underwhelming. The steamed egg was bad too."}
{"text":"It is the best Vietnamese restaurant in ssauga now.  And Iam Vietnamese.
Place is small but the food worth it. 
You can not go wrong with their pho. Price is sooooo reasonable and service is so accommodating.  I shall be coming here every week and I will try something new every week."}
{"text":"I come here when craving banh xeo because they are one of the only restaurants that I know that offers banh xeo on their menu. The banh xeo here is pretty good. It's crispy and not soggy. It comes with a side of veggies and fish sauce. There's a lot of bean sprouts in it, some pork and some shrimp. But it's missing the yellow beans that are usually inside these Viet crepes. It's lacking some flavour but it will do. 

As for the pho, the pho here is more reasonably priced and better than most place (Pho mi 99). I feel like the broth here is a little stronger than most pho places in Sauga as it doesn't seem as watered down. 

Overall, great place for banh xeo whereas for the pho, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Authentic decent place for a quick meal.  The bean sprouts came cooked which was a nice surprise.  Prices were a lot better before it became 'I love pho'.  Came in with a group of 25 on a Saturday evening and they can easily accommodate that, the place is quite large."}
{"text":"Great food, great flavors, and the portions are spot on. 
Just the right amount of everything.

Pho hits home! but I love pho hits all the right spots.
I can't say this enough but portion is huge when it comes to pho restaurants, for example: vermicelli needs the right amount of noodles, meat and veggies. same with the pho, each size bowl needs the right amount of noodles and meat. I love pho gets it done.
my favorite is the sausage fresh roll, it is quite the appetizer,

The place is pretty classy and quite clean, but it does get pretty busy here, and sometimes there is a wait for a table, so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Ahhhh!! Was craving for Vietnamese food and I read a lot of good reviews from Yelp.

We ordered
212 : medium rare lightly fat beef & beef balls on soup small ($6)
414: grilled chicken, grilled beef meatballs, spring rolls vermicelli ($7.50)

SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!! MY FAVOURITE VIETNAMESE PHO PLACE SO FAR!!!! 

1. Generous portioning
2. very hardworking &
    accommodating waiters
3. GREAT FOOD!!!!!!! 

Total of $15.67 for these!
Need I say more?"}
{"text":"My two colleagues and I went out for lunch a couple of Fridays ago. Our original plan was to eat at Dairy Queen. When we got to the plaza, I noticed a sign for I Love Pho. I was intrigued. So were my colleagues. We completely changed our lunch plans and hit this restaurant.

It's a good sign of a decent pho place when it is packed at noon. We got the last available table. Yay!

I pointed out what I normally get as far as pho goes. I like the rare beef and beef balls pho. They followed suit. It's nice that they trust me! One of them ordered the small size. The other person and I went with the medium. We looked at the table to my right. The couple had ordered the large, which looked like they could have both dunked their heads in the bowl and they would have fit. It was huge!

We also got the four-piece pork and chicken spring rolls. I filled out everything and handed the little slip of paper to our server.

The pho broth was fragrant and perfect. I immediately knew that I was going to enjoy my pho. The rare beef and beef balls were exactly right. The bean sprouts, mint, and lime wedge were fresh. My colleagues enjoyed their bowls of pho, too.

I always feel like you are not eating pho right if you don't splatter your food on your shirt. We all did that. Or, perhaps we are just slobs and want to feel better about ourselves.

Our spring rolls did not come. I flagged a server to ask about them. It's funny how I had that item at the top of the filled-out form, but they were fine getting our pho orders correct. Eventually, our spring rolls came. They were yummy. Had we got our rolls without my flagging someone, I would have given this place a full five stars.

It's a decent place for pho. It's one of the better places that I have been to in a while. I can't wait to return here soon.

{"text":"This is not a new restaurant, just a name change. It was Pho Mi Asia for years and the quality has stayed the same. The servers are very efficient and the food is always good and delivered promptly. Prices are also good.

The curried chicken is delicious. Very generous portion of bone-in chicken (usually about 4 pieces) in a bowl of coconut curry soup with potatoes. 
There is a choice of noodles in the soup or rice on the side.

The beef stew with rice noodles is very good. It comes with lots of beef and some carrots. I order the medium and usually have to take half of it home as it's such a generous portion.

The vermicelli dishes are served with thicker noodles than usual, but are always very tasty.

We've been coming here for many years and have tried many of the soups and rice dishes. We've never been disappointed. 

Since the name change, they're now accepting credit cards instead of just cash or debit."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to I Love Pho and we were very pleased with both the food and the service.

First of all, the decor is clean and modern. The restaurant is very clean (partly because it's quite new, I'm sure). 

We visited at 11:30 (ish) on a Friday and there were already a couple of tables filled. By the time we left (around 12:30), the restaurant was more than half full.

The service was definitely better than at most Vietnamese restaurants in the area. The server came over to our table a few minutes after our menus were delivered to ask if we had any questions. He came back after our food was delivered to ask how it was (pretty much unheard of at Viet. restaurants in the area other than Pho Queen City).

We ordered one vermicelli dish and one rice dish. Both were hot, tasty and very nicely presented. The spring roll with the vermicelli dish was really good, with lots of taro inside. The steamed egg with the rice dish was a little drier than usual, but still not bad.

The prices were very reasonable, with the bill coming in under $20 including tax and tip.

All in all, this was a very good experience and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very delicious broth with good amount of noodles and meat. Very reasonable prices compared to other pho places in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The second time coming here and I don't know what happened!! When I first tried this place I ordered the grilled beef with vermicelli and my mom ordered a soup.. It was amazing, so flavourful and service was great! Yesterday I ordered the same dish and it was horrendous the \"grilled beef\" was so chewy and tasted more like pork. So so salty as well. To top it off the girl working at the cash really needs to learn people skills."}
{"text":"Walking in was like walking into an average pho joint.  

However, this place rates a lot higher than most of the pho places within the GTA.

First of all - I've never seen a pho place with that many sauces and to display them so neatly (refer to picture).
The pho here was definitely a price to quality & quantity match.  The large was $7.00 and this included a huge bowl of noodles (thin ones - my favourite), tasty broth that wasn't overpowering nor was it weak, and good portions of meat.  The only downside was that the bean sprouts weren't too fresh."}
{"text":"Had to come here after seeing all the reviews! I give I Love Pho a 3.5, but I'll round it up. 

It wasn't too busy when I got here, however I came around 930 and there were still at least 4 other tables. For a weekday night, this is pretty good! The restaurant is pretty small compared to many pho restaurants, so I can see why it gets busy and full fast.

I usually find all pho restaurants to have similar atmosphere, service and even pho to taste the same. This place is no different, granted I only had a couple bites from my boyfriend's pho. 

I ordered the bun bo hue - and omg I looove it! Just the perfect amount of spice, broth, noodles and meat. I really recommend this if you are planning on stopping by for the first time or just want to try something new here. 

I definitely recommend this place for their bun bo hue! You can a good portion for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Got a medium sized bowl of Pho. Noodles and soup base were good but the portion size was too small! The portion size given should have been a small sized bowl. I had to eat some of my boyfriends bowl for me to be content. Service was not the greatest either.."}
{"text":"Probably the best Pho place in Mississauga right now. Authentic food. Rare dishes. Nice decor and good service."}
{"text":"Got pho for takeout. They don't offer small for takeout so I got the medium. $7.50 - very reasonable. 

It was delicious! Satisfied my craving for pho. 
The broth, meat, tendons, noodles were all yummy. 

Service was good and quick. 
Parking lot outside."}
{"text":"There are 2 I Love Pho restaurants in Mississauga, and this Dixie/Dundas location is not only bigger, but IMO, tastes better than its counterpart on Burmhamthorpe. I order the vermicelli with spring roll, grilled and shredded pork. It came in a mountainous bowl complete with chopped peanuts, raw shredded veggies and some sort of glass noodle. I poured a lot of fish sauce on mixed up all the components. There could've been more grilled pork, but for $8, I can't complain. The flavours were all there - smokiness from the grilled pork, crunchiness from the cucumbers and shredded lettuce, tons of peanuts. My parents ordered the special Pho #201 and a plate of rice that came with grilled pork, chicken and Vietnamese egg (also $8). The restaurant itself could be cleaner, but other than that, I have no other complaints. I will definitely be back for Pho!"}
{"text":"Following several Vietnamese friends recommending this place as a favourite within Mississauga I decided to skip my usual place and check it out. 
We drove into the plaza to find a line of people waiting for a table. I waited by the door for someone to write my name down, but after waiting for around 5 minutes I realized that we were actually meant to go up to the counter and ask them personally to write our names down for a table. We must've waited for 12-15 minutes until we finally got a table, which turned out to be a sharing table with another family. However I did not mind, since they made a sort of separation between the sharing tables with a condiments tray. 
I wanted my usual, the rice with grilled chicken and fried egg. 2 things I noticed was that they did not have a vegetarian section in the menu and the grilled chicken that I usually get was slightly more expensive compared to my usual Vietnamese restaurants. My friend got the tofu pho and fresh rolls.
My meal arrived first and for the quantity they served (gigantic!), the price was actually extremely reasonable. Compared to the usual 1 bowl of rice with one fried egg, they served me what seemed like 3 cups of rice and 2 fried eggs! It was enormous, whereby I had to leave out some of the rice, which is something I rarely do. The food was as delicious as my usual spots and the service was efficient and timely, and the man serving us was also polite. 
The wait was definitely worth it as I enjoyed everything about this place and luckily it's right near my home, so It'll definitely become a regular visit for me."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed when their location on Burnhamthorpe closed down for renovations. I hadn't had Vietnamese food since then but when I recently learned that they had a second location I had to give it a try!

Came in weekday during dinner time expecting a long line up like how it always was in their first location. It was actually less than half full and I thought to myself that maybe I made a bad decision  thinking that they could live up my expectations.

The restaurant was a little more spacious in terms of walkway room but the seating areas were pretty spacious with the booth tables. 

We ordered the vermicelli with pork and spring rolls as well as an appetizer of Vietnamese fresh spring rolls. Food came in no time and portion sizes were large and comparable to their home location! What I especially loved was that their meat was less cut up into smaller pieces which was more of a personal preference. Flavour-wise, the food was great!

I would love to come back sometime soon to try out their pho. Although it's a little more farther drive for me, it serves my craving for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"After reading the good reviews from this place I finally decided to try their Pho. I ordered my usual house special pho that came with an assortment of meats. They had a large menu which made me tempt to try something new. My pho came on a serving tray covered in water. The teapot lid was broken (?) and my tea ran cold before I started eating. The soup was made with too much fish sauce, which I've never encountered before after visiting a number of Vietnamese restaurants. It was early in the morning and we came right when they opened so we were the first customers. Little did they know that I was with someone who understood what they were speaking loudly in Vietnamese and told me that they were trying to rush us to pay and leave a few minutes after we finished our meals!"}
{"text":"First visit to this new restaurant and bam! 
It hits all the check marks for a successful restaurant!

It's a smallish restaurant but the service and attention was great.

The pho was reasonably priced and very tasty.
$6 for small, $6.50 for medium and $7.00 for large.
No prizes for guessing what size I had and was the best value!

My wife had the chicken curry with noodles and she loved it.

We will be back pho sure!"}
{"text":"It's sad because this place seems to be going downhill. It's still clean and priced well but their food really isn't as good now. The pho is now even more bland than before. Also, the vermicelli I got featured some really dry tasting pork. Oh and very old looking sprouts and lettuce in it too. Yikes. Well it was a good run while it lasted."}
{"text":"One of my favourite pho places in Mississauga. Only thing I find is that sometimes it taste better than others. If it was consistent, I would have given a 5 star. Also have ordered a pho to go a few times and I find they can give more meat considering it's a large. It was mostly noodles."}
{"text":"Open till 4am. What else is there to say. The pho is not the best in Atlanta, but tasty enough if you travel long distances to get to Atlanta. You can count on their consistency in their food items."}
{"text":"What to get:

The soup phos of course!! My favorite is usually the house special 201. For a small, it's $7 and it's a decent size. I enjoy the broth and the portions of noodle to meat and tripe as well. The service was fast and efficient. For any pho places go for the pho. But also try the grilled chicken/beef on rice as well as the vermicelli with mixed meats and spring roll. They're usually my go to items of choice. Can't go wrong with spring roll too. Or maybe a shrimp rice roll if you're feeling healthy. 

Last tips: 

Usually does drop-in. Rarely ppl make reservations at pho restaurants. A lot of Vietnamese love this place so that adds another level of credibility to this restaurant! If the locals love the food here...then you non-Viets wouldn't go wrong coming here to try!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure when this place opened up but apparently it's related to the original I love Pho down on Burnhamthrope/Mavis. This place is literally called I love Pho 2. We were around the area so we went to try this new place out. The layout seems similar to Pho Mi 99 in Heartland and there's a lot of seating space. Ofc trying a new pho place, I got the pho tai (my to go pho bowl). The broth is flavourful and it tasted good. Usually after I finish eating pho, depending on the place I eat at my throat would get itchy.. which to me indicates that they use a lot of msg stuff in it. I didn't get that feeling here so the soup is good here! There was a lot of rare beef pieces which had no fat and didn't curl up a lot (huge plus for me in pho). There were also a lot of garnishments on top and they used red onions. This is pretty rare for pho places, most use the regular onions. 

This place is one of the cheaper places for pho and the portions are pretty big. I would come back to try another dish and I gotta add the viet drip coffee!"}
{"text":"although they have raised their prices since it became \"I love pho 2\" and got a new sign...  the portions are still VERY LARGE and the food tastes great too.  At least 50% more food in general than the average pho place.  the pics dont even do justice.     

its about 8 dollars a large pho.. 8.50 an entree .. they also have speciality dishes like sour soup combos, and platters you can wrap your own vietnamese handrolls.   they also have thai food such as pad thai which cost 10 dollars.  

when im in the area this has become my go to viet restaurant."}
{"text":"I love pho! 

Large size special pho came with ample amount of meat( tendons, tripe, beef slices etc).  Broth is solid but less sweet if I had to compare to pho88.  Overall, great value for under 10 bucks.  

P.s: XL size pho is not an option. Large size will be sufficiently filling."}
{"text":"This horrible pho place will close soon if they keep up the horrible service. The only reason they are still busy is because of old customers of Pho Mi Asia. Im an old customer and after my two crappy experiences at this place I will never step in to I Love Pho 2 and would recommend against it. 

Service: horrendous. Absolutely brutal. They need to retrain their staff especially the young bitchy girls with long hair. We do not expect great service at these asians places because they arent paid that much but a baseline level of respect for customers should be there. First visit after they changed for 2 months from pho mi asia the service was so slow. We were one of two tables there and they took 15 min to even come to get our order sheet. They ignored us throughout the entire dinner and we had to go to the counter to ask for sauce and rice paper because they forgot to give it with our 7 beef course. We thought maybe because they are new. Gave them another chance. We sat down with my mom and my sister today. Asked for 3 courses of 7 beef. Waited 15 min no food which is unusual for a pho restaurant because usually they are quick. Asked again if the order is put in or should we give them the form on the table. Waitress nodded it is coming. 25 min in. No food. Gave the little order form. Another waitress put it in. The first one just completely forgot and gave a reply even though she forgot. Asked for water 5 times before we got it and only after my husband asked in a more firm tone did we get anywhere. If you order pop maybe it would be quicker. Wth I would happily pay for water to get some service! The table is small instead of putting all the 3 veggies platters in one platter our super clever waitress brought all three huge plates out and looked angry at us that she couldnt fit it on the table. We had to combine the platters ourselves. Seriously it doesnt take a grade 3 intelligence to think of this. We had 7 people they only brought out 6 dinner plates. We had to ask for more. 7 beef course but only brought out 6 beef courses and we had to remind they were missing one more 20 min after we finished everything else . The whole time the waitresses were grumpy as fack. 

Food: my mom, sister and brother in law were flabbergasted how this place is still open. Their beef with rice dish and 7 beef were the worst Vietnamese food they have ever had. To be honest, super embarassing we had taken them to eat here. 

Atmosphere: relatively clean place for an asian restaurant 

Price: cheap but not worth the poor food quality or service.

Stay away! The owner need to better train their staff or pay them decently so they arent such arseholes to customers."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for dinner yesterday to try out their food and take advantage of their 20% off discount. The restaurant got quite busy soon after we arrived. Maybe it looked like there were a lot of customers because the restaurant is really small.

We all ordered various dishes, such as: the bun bo hue, pho, and vermicelli with fish sauce and assorted meats. I ordered my bun bo hue without the spice and they were able to cater it just to my liking. I prefer to put in the spice in by myself so they gave me some on the side. It was quite good and I would order it again the next time I'm here. My boyfriend and sister both had their pho and said they enjoyed it. They also said it tastes similar to other pho restaurants. My parents also enjoyed their vermicelli.

The restaurant was quite hot because the sun was shining directly into the restaurant. It made us all very hot and sweaty while eating which wasn't very enjoyable. But that's not the restaurants fault."}
{"text":"We definitely love Pho as we have it at least once or twice a week.  So I could say that we have a very good idea of the difference in terms of quality of Pho.  Obviously the most important thing about Pho is their soup.  That is their key ingredient for Beef noodle soup.  It should have a strong beef flavour that has been boiling for hours.  

My husband always goes for the \"Special\".  It is a mix of beef, beef balls, tripe, beef brisket.  Really awesome if you want to have a good selection of their meats in the soup.  I, on the other hand like to try a few of their other signature Vietnamese dishes.  A few of my favourites there is their Vietnamese chicken curry noodle which you can have on rice or noodle.  Very tasty.  Big generous chunks of chicken.  I load it up with cilantro and green onions.  

Another favourite to have here and is great for sharing is the Spring roll platter.  You get to make your own Spring rolls with the different stuffing that you choose to have inside of it.  Huge platter for $15.  Two of us share that and we can even still make a few more for other members of the family dining with us.  Haha, great value indeed!  

I would recommend this place for sure but just make sure you come slightly before or after their lunch or dinner rush.  They are usually packed!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, open late.

Rare beef was too chewy :(

The noodle was overcooked.


It'd satisfy late night munchies but I don't see my self going back."}
{"text":"Overall this was an \"ok\" meal. Although the pricing is inexpensive and you are given a lot of protein compared to other Vietnamese restaurants; the food tasted mediocre. 

My biggest concern is how sanitary this restaurant really is. My dish arrived much later than the rest of the food for my table due their \"under staffed\" delay ( I think this is simply because they got the orders mixed up because they were short staffed, this was also the case for a party that sat behind us). THE RED FLAG: the piece of plastic I found in my noodles half way through the meal. We immediately brought this to their attention and they replied with basically \"sorry, but we are under staffed and mistakes happen.\" Yes, we could tell you were under staffed however, that doesn't give you an excuse to rush and feed us plastic by mistake. They did however offer a compensation with a refund or redo."}
