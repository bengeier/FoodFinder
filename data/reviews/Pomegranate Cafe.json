{"text":"They have amazing food. Our favorite are the desserts, especially the raw cheesecake. It's not just for vegetarians/ vegans - even my grandpa who eats meat everyday was loving the Philly melt......until we told him it wasn't beef :-)"}
{"text":"What a find! Heading back to Tucson we were searching for a place to grab lunch and we landed at this fabulous little place. Quality ingredients, skillful preparation and wonderful presentation made our meal enjoyable. We sampled the breakfast burrito, avocado and egg sandwich, fresh juices and a Milky Way coffee. The fresh veggies, tepary beans and were tasty and nothing was over cooked. There were no salt and pepper shakers on the table- they weren't needed because everything was seasoned just right! The comfortable, light and inviting atmosphere completed the experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pomegranate is definitely one of the best veg restaurants I've ever been to and has to be my favorite. They have a vast menu with a variety of options and even have a separate seasonal menu, plus weekend specials. Since moving to Arizona I have eaten here at least 25+ and have yet to be disappointed.   They use fresh and local ingredient that are always flavored/cooked to perfection. You'll want to save room for dessert (be careful the meals are filling) because their pastry display case is to die for. And on top of all their amazing food, the staff is always super friendly.    They have the 3 best qualities any top restaurant needs, great food, great service, and a great atmosphere. I would 10/10 recommend this for anyone whether you're vegish or not. All of my non-vegan friends that I've taken here were in shock that it tasted so good and filled them up!! Take a look at their colorful instagram and you'll see why I rave about this place.  I have never written a yelp review nearly this long before but I don't think I'll ever find one thing wrong with Pomegranate. If I could afford to eat here everyday, I 100% would."}
{"text":"Slow service all while the front staff was flirting and chatting with each other.  Good food, just hard to come back when service is so poor and your paying a decent cent for the food."}
{"text":"I tried to give this place a chance, but after the second time of slow service and mediocre food, I'm done. I understand sometimes service can be slow due to lack of staff/big parties, but it would be nice if the staff would communicate with there tables as they see them sit there forever with drinks and no food! The waitstaff seemed out of sync and unorganized. I ordered the scramble and it was definitely NOT worth the wait or money. My advice: if you go, make sure you have the day off because the wait time is serious."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this terrific cafe. The food was flavorful, and the staff were attentive  and helpful. Great place,  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"NOT Gluten Free!  I requested a gluten free avocado sandwich. The sandwich was brought to the table with the the statement \"we are out of avocados.\" I took 2 bites and realized something was wrong. I went back to the server and asked if she were sure it was a gluten free? She came back to the table with a plate of bread and said \"no, not all the way but here is gluten free bread for you.\" I handed her back my original plate shocked And she walked away. No I'm sorry. No what can I do. Very ignorant as to what gluten free means. Eat at your own RISK!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. My boyfriend and I eat here at least once every two weeks but sometimes more often. After relocating to this area from Northern California i was bummed there wasn't more organic/vegan/healthy places around and I'm so grateful this place is close(ish) to my house and the food and juices are always delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. Had the Athena bowl and it was amazing. It had a side of kalamata hummus and macadamia nut pesto. So many flavors that meshed deliciously!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Sadly my family does not so I either need to eat alone or do takeout. The hummos is unique and light...I had a salad with what I think was cold quinoa. This opened the wonderful world of quinoa to me.   I love the pommegranite on the salad. So perfect. And the pesto was nummy as well.   I had a gift certificate the first time I web here. It was from a silent auction at our church. Subsequent visits made me realize the cost prohibitive nature of this wonderful cafe.   If I win the lotto I will visit this restaurant weekly.   Really wish they had some coupons or discount dates or frequent visitor program."}
{"text":"What a great place! Our wait was a bit long, but that's to be expected at noon and with so few vegan options in the city. Every thought my we had was bursting with flavor. At the end our server thanked us for our patience with complimentary truffles. Can't wait to eat here again and again!"}
{"text":"As a vegan and  a local I knew I had to try Pomegranate Café. And while I am thrilled to have another vegan-friendly restaurant in my area I can't help but feel disappointed.   We went in here for breakfast not long ago and the joint had a nice atmosphere and the staff was super friendly.  Here's the thing, though. While I was satisfied with just a fresh (moderately priced) vegetable juice, my girlfriend wanted to try their avocado sandwich. This thing runs you $7.50 and is tiny! More a bite than an actual breakfast, this item was definitely not worth it. Perhaps their other menu items have larger portions, and I would be more than willing to try Pomegranate Café again. But for my money, I'd much rather go down the road to 24 Carrots for breakfast."}
{"text":"Food is good however, to go order process is a nightmare! Hands down the worst take out process I've ever experienced. (Actually downloaded the yelp app just to post this review! It's that awful!) But at least most of the staff is condescending, so there is that!  20 mins to get cupcakes with two people in front of me. Wow!"}
{"text":"QUICK AND HEALTHY, BUT I'M STILL HUNGRY :(  The Pomegranate Cafe is a cheery place to have a quick light lunch - emphasis on light.  I was excited to see so many leafy greens in a lighted refrigerator case - these would be showcased in my lunch as I had the soup and salad combo.  The Ultimate \"un-chicken\" Ceaser Salad and a butternut squash and chickpea minestrone cup of soup had an wonderful variety of colors and textures to make my mouth sing - but after finishing, I admit that I was neither stuffed nor satisfied.  So I got a Larabar from the Trader Joe's next door.    Overall, I'd like to go again to try something else on the menu, but I'll definitely go on a day where I need or want to eat something light."}
{"text":"Please attend this place if you like waiting 20 minutes to be seated when there are multiple open tables. Then get seated at dirty table and then the waitress sprays you with the table cleaner. Waited over 50 minutes for the food that never came and 4-5 \"your food will be right up\" before walking out. We ordered breakfast and they offered us chips and salsa till our food got there. It was lunch time by the time our breakfast didn't show. If you like that kinda of service be my guest."}
{"text":"Delicious flavorful vegetarian restaurant the best I've had in phoenix. Prices are higher than most buy for all organic ingredients it's understandable. I would recommend this so long as you know it's 25 percent more than everywhere else."}
{"text":"We ate there our first day of vacation, Russell was our server.  It was fantastic. We had to return on our last day of vacation and we brought more people.  Place is so great we wish we could bring it home in NH. Awesome! Our friends ate the cakes and said it was the best they ever had.  I'm gluten free and there were several choices. Great, great, great!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I noticed a lot of people there and wondered if it was worth the trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  On the day I went, I had a vegieburger and it was really good, came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!"}
{"text":"Pros  Food is always good and fresh - Five stars  Cons - One Star Long wait - I am talking no in store and it took 20 min to make 1 smoothie , 1 Latte and 1 Juice  We have tried .the business 5 time and never been out the door in less than 20 min"}
{"text":"Pomegranate Cafe is okay.  I ordered one slice of pink cake, one blueberry cheesecake, and two lemonades.  The total was $26.  I checked the receipt to figure out what I ordered. I get that all the ingredients are fresh and local, but I was still shocked.  I expected the food to be amazing because it was so expensive.  It was okay not amazing. The lemonade was not that good.  It had a bitter and spicy note that threw me off.  The pink cake was a little soggy.    The decor is weird.  I can see what they are trying to do, but it would create a nicer atmosphere if they would get rid of the florescent ceiling lights.  The staff is totally spaced out.  They remind me of the Cheba Hut employees before they became a national chain."}
{"text":"Love this place. So glad they have the extended hours now. Food is unbelievable delicious and healthy."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent! My favorite organic, vegan, gluten-free restaurant in all of Arizona!  I especially love their raw options and everything I've ever ordered off the menu has been amazing ~ a definite A+. Great atmosphere and service and we come here at least 3-4 times a month, for our \"Pomegranate fix\". Can't get enough! Thank you Pomegranate Cafe ~"}
{"text":"First visit*   Terrible service. If you dont mind that. Enjoy!   Many people experience terrible service here. Read the reviews. I dont feel alone anymore.  The manager was frustrated that we asked for a plate and silverware.  They made the mistake of not seating us. Then the MANAGER came to my table with NO PLATES ..to verbally tell me they wont serve me again if i make the mistake of ordering at the counter.    I politely shared that i told them we were ordering in. I decided to tale my family and leave. I already paid 55 bucks on food   Yup! I was shocked too.  Wow."}
{"text":"I'm a long time Pomegranate visitor. It's one of the only options currently for plant-based eaters, especially since Sage closed in Phoenix. The food is decent, though expensive, but i've definitely had better in other states. It takes a while to be seated on a weekend at Pom, and even longer to get your food."}
{"text":"I had great service and the food was excellent! The juice is really good, the abundance is my fav. The cute short waitress with long brown hair and blue eyes working was very polite and informative. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Best vegan food in town without a doubt. Even my dedicated carnivorous friends love the flavors, textures and overall experience. Service is very good as well, this is my second review and I have to give full credit to the management for turning this place around in terms of service. The food was always awesome and is still amazing."}
{"text":"This place is great. I went out on a limb for this place. I was heading to chandler when I wanted something fresh and light. So I yelped my way in the direction of my final destination and found this delicious little spot.   I had the Tacos Raw and the lime-ade to drink. The tacos were AMAZING! The lime-made was ok. It was a bit expensive for what it was. I really liked the concept and set up of the restaurant. I'd recommend this place to my friends. If it weren't far from where I lived I would definitely go back regularly."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this vegan restauran, not only do they have vegan items but raw items as well . I love the drinks, smoothies, juices, and all their food but they lost a star due to their desserts. I love they have vegan and raw desserts but they lack flavor, so this disappoints me with them.....but I really do enjoy everything else. Drinks are a little pricey which is unfortunate but I will treat myself with one when I am here.  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner here BUT after 8 pm to the last hour open, you can only order food from the counter and everything is served in plastic (take out containers ) that you can eat outside or towards the front even though they close at 9.  My son says the gila nachos are best he has ever had. He LOVES them !  They have a happy hour that you can try some of their small bites / plates til 6 pm, Mon -Fri. Definitely worth it if you want to try some things from the menu."}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with this place. My husband & I went on Saturday after I discovered this existed. It's 50 miles from my house & SOOOO worth it!  I plan on asking if they will make some vegan desserts for our upcoming wedding.  The staff was super friendly and the food & desserts were amazing. We had a dragon-fruit cheesecake & also an almond joy bar for dessert. I had a supreme burrito for lunch.. it was Muy Bueno!  Highly recommended even if you're not vegan."}
{"text":"They seem to use good ingredients but everything is \"sloppy\" - kind of like backpacker food - thrown together.  I had the street tacos which were quite good but the mushroom sliders just didn't work somehow and the tuna melt sliders were gross, really truly one small bite gross.  My server seemed completely indifferent to a returned full plate of food and asked if I wanted dessert, so just to reinforce the fact that I was still hungry I said \"yes\".  Still not one word of reaction, yes I could have said something but most well trained staff would have asked without prompting.  Poor food and bad service - this place isn't for me, never again."}
{"text":"Such an amazing atmosphere as soon as you walk in. I was greeted by smiling happy faces which were genuine! I ordered the tacos vivos, recommendation from the lovely knowledgeable girl working there, I also got an abundance drink which was made to perfection!!! I have no complaints about this place! I will def be referring friends to this unique and healthy place!!!!!!!! The food was amazing, the staff was sweet and KNOWLEDGEABLE they could answer any questions and helped me even if I was being a little indecisive, and the atmosphere just added the cherry on top, the energy and vibe in there was just great! i cant say enough good things about this place!!!!! If you have any questions the pretty redhead girl knows what she's talking about!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Local, organic, vegetarian/vegan.    The food is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for here.  You can tell that they put in the time to make each dish an experience.    My favorite item thus far is the Smoking Tempeh BLT.  It comes with a great salad, that would suffice as a meal on its own.  But the sandwich was fantastic.  I thought about it the rest of the day.  The Arizona Roll is another great item.  It's Nori seaweed stuffed with almond spread and a mix of vegetables.  The almond spread is especially delicious.  The roll is served like sushi, with soy sauce and wasabi.  The loose leafs teas here are really good too, as are the fresh juices."}
{"text":"This place can be nice or terrible depending on what time you go. I usually order the avocado and green chili cheese crisp. My most recent expierence was really disappointing. Before my recent vistit and any time I've gone there they always got my food out looking excellent, taste is amazing (however not consistent). The wait time doesn't bother me, I'm paying for good food I don't mind waiting. I ordered a TOGO of what I usually get and a smoothie that I've gotten before that I really liked. When I got home the smoothie had an after taste of barf, and the food was not good at all. I've gotten it a lot of times before so I'm not sure if they changed the vegan cheese on it or what happened. But it had this orange colored chesse on it and it didn't do the food any justice, didn't taste great at all. I ordered the vegan cheese, but it really looked and tasted like normal cheese. I am really disappointed, I spent a good amount of money on what I thought would be good food. I didn't spend the money so people could mess up on my food/drink. I would have rather them tell me they fucked up my order and spend the extra time making it right rather than getting it out as quickly as possible. I find the best service is around 4-closing. The morning service is just not that great."}
{"text":"This place never fails to impress me AND NO, I AM NOT A VEGETARIAN. Why do you ask?"}
{"text":"Amazing. It is indescribable how great it feels to go to a restaurant where I can order anything on the menu without having to ask if it is vegan...AND the food is delicious. Just scrumptious. Currently sipping on a pitaya (dragonfruit) mojito that is unique and beautiful as well as tasty. Menu is made from scratch and you can taste it. Vegans rejoice! Now if only I could get them to move up north to Prescott.........."}
{"text":"Food tastes great. You can tell that there has been love put in it. We have been vegan for 3 years and it's often hard to find good vegan food at restaurants- luckily we live in Southern California so it's not much of an issue here, and luckily Pomegranate didn't disappoint! I got the blueberry streusel french toast which was delicious, but tiny portion! Hubby got the nachos which were really flavourful, and he enjoyed them a lot. He got the turmeric latte- you can definitely tell that it's fresh turmeric, not powdered. Definitely an acquired taste but since we both enjoy turmeric at home, we loved it! I got the jnantik mocha which was amazing. I'm still dreaming about it now, and can't wait to come back to Phoenix to have another one!  We loved the food so much we even got some to go- the seaweed salad and a raw collard wrap. Both were good! I would definitely get the salad again, it was so different to anything I've ever had before.  The only cons are that the food is expensive (maybe foolish of me but I expected prices to be a bit less in Arizona compared to LA since rent, cost of living etc are cheaper), and the portion sizes were kind of small (maybe just what we ordered). But I do understand that the food is organic, non-gmo, etc, which I really appreciate!   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have had my ups and downs with Pomegranate, but mainly ups. They seemed to have a new manager my last visit and things seemed to have improved. I enjoyed sitting outside eating. I had the Strawberry Pom Milkshake. I tasted the Maca Magic, but preferred the Strawberry Pom. We had the Mac & Cheese and possibly some type of burger with pineapple I think. I can't 100% remember what I had to eat, but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I was pretty sceptical about this place from the other reviews that I had read on Yelp. It turned out to be a great place to eat. The only thing I would tell this restaurant to change is to get a bigger location because the place was packed when I went in for lunch.   As far as some of the issues that were mentioned in previous reviews, it looked like pomagrante cafe worked to fix them. No more paper plates and the restaurant was kept pretty clean, especially with how busy they were. While I was there another customer had dropped something and anywhere else it would have stayed there until they slowed down, not here though one of the employees who was delivering food to tables cleaned it up and was busing tables inbetween dropping off food. I was impressed.  There are some things in other reviews that are still true. Food does take a while there, which I think was mainly because of how busy they were. Plus portion sizes were a little on the small side, I felt that they were plety big enough to calm my appitiete, which was what I was going for.   As far as vegitarian/vegan places go, this one rocks. Check it out."}
{"text":"I just heard about this place from my hairdresser today, and made a beeline for it. Let me just say it was wonderful. The people were extremely friendly and helpful, the food was OUTSTANDING, the ambiance was warm and inviting. They also had a huge selection of teas and coffee's. Their signature pomegranate tea is homemade by the owner with agave. Super yummy! I HIGHLY recommend this little gem to the veggie and non-veggies out there! Yum, Yum!"}
{"text":"My favorite vegan restaurant in the valley, hands down!!   Everything from the breakfast burrito to the handcrafted desserts are simply divine and will leave your taste buds craving more!  I wish this restaurant was closer as I would be there weekly, if not daily.  Well worth the drive and the money if one desires an unforgettable culinary experience."}
{"text":"Very creative food options for those who are vegetarian, vegan, raw, etc. Love that they are organic and make everything fresh! Many many options as well. Love the feel of the place! The vegan cheesecake was so delicious! That was our favorite! Love to support healthy, local places!"}
{"text":"I love the food.  Really it is good but.... you better be relaxed when you go there because it will not be fast.  They do have a menu now so that is good.  The drinks are expensive but I had the Hibiscus Cooler and it was awesome.  Try it, you'll feel healthy for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. Today was the first day I had ever tried this little gem and boy, was I happy! I ordered a Pom Latte with caramel, pesto Caesar wrap and a rocky road bar for dessert, which were all so yummy!! The place is so clean, open and fun with a great atmosphere. People would stop by our table to check up on us to make sure we were okay, and our server was very kind. My party also ordered the dragon bowl and Kung pao wrap, along with the lemonade and pomegranate green tea, and pecan and lemon bars. Everything was EXTREMELY good and I'll be more than happy to go back! :) a tad pricey but for the quality, amount of food and the fact that it's all organic and vegan/vegetarian without GMOs, it was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that it took a few times of going to this restaurant for me to really appreciate it. I was convinced if I found a few items on the menu I loved it would make it completely worth it, there are not very many vegan restaurants like this so I was willing to give it a second and even third chance if I had to. The menu is a tad bit big so it was hard to decide what I wanted to try, and some of the descriptions for the food were off. For example, I ordered the curry and expected something like a traditional thai curry but it was more of a rice bowl with curry seasoning.  Their vegan mac and cheese is amazing, I also love anything that includes their home made bread. I actually usually order the english muffin pizza off of the kids menu because it is the perfect portion, it costs less then the typical meal here, and it is simple. The Jnantik Mocha is amazing, and so are the deserts!"}
{"text":"I need to start by mentioning that the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. Also, the menu is fantastic. Not the actual food, but the menu itself. The dishes are simple and there is enough variety to appease just about anybody. The main problem with this restaurant is the execution of these dishes. The food is bland, vegetables are soggy and wet, and the meat substitutes are poorly prepared and undercooked. I have been a vegetarian for 16 years, and I eat mostly vegan. My diet consists mostly of fresh vegetables, so I am no stranger to this type of cuisine. The ingredients used are fantastic, they just need to better season and cook them. If that were to happen, 2 stars would be added to this review. The other star would be earned from making the dining room more comfortable. Every table was filthy, and I mean filthy. Crusted old liquids and crumbs adorned them all. The thermostat is dangling from an electrical wire from the ceiling in the middle of the restaurant. The wall paint is splotchy and unfinished.   While this review is very critical (as reviews should be), it is not intended to damage this restaurant's reputation. The owners have a very solid idea, but it is obvious that there is an absence of a talented chef. If the Pomegranate Cafe invests in paying more attention to flavor and a more inviting atmosphere, they will have a 5-star restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want to eat healthy food that makes you feel better after eating it- you found your place. The only opportunity for them I see is that sometimes the owner can be a bit cold toward their customers as you see her walking around. Aside from that please don't let that stop you from going - it is truly the best vegan/vegetarian food you will ever have."}
{"text":"Pomegranate Cafe has an excellent choice of foods for vegan diners. We have always enjoyed their food and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"It was my first visit and probably my last.   On the plus side the food was delicious. Tiss a shame that the taste and presentation was not the only piece of our experience.   On the minus side the first choice of meals was unavailable, however I was given the option to wait while they went to trader joes next store to grab soy chorizo. The portions small, we waited 15 minutes for one coffee, and  30 minutes for the other.  my 4 dollar mocha missed the yuminess mark, and my wifes cup of joe was not delicious enough to remind her she had wanted it before eating most of her meal. At a half hour wait we went to check on coffee two, when it was delivered it was not with a smile or apology, but with annoyed a toss the cream onto the table in a huff during delivery. The shop uses mason jars or old fruit jars for glasses, neato recycling effort,  Bright burgundy lipstick on one of the water jars not as welcome. We watched the inattentive staff ignoring orders to go out from our seats.  I was definitely not feeling the service or care love of the staff. Unfortunately the vegan wife left very unhappy with the 40 dollars spent on breakfast for three, leaving still hungry, and feeling poorly treated."}
{"text":"Ugh. What a mess.   We went to this cafe Sat. night for a friend's 30th birthday. Let's run through the whole event. We arrive at 7 with a somewhat large-ish party (8 people) and they weren't too busy - well more than half the tables were empty. We went inside and one of the staff members helped move a couple tables together to seat everyone. 15 mins later, a waitress comes by with a tray of waters. She literally threw them at us. They were slammed down on the table with such forces that water spilled out the top. No apology, no offer to clean them up. Waitress looked like we personally had run over her dog, scowling and glaring at us. So, not off to a great start. Another 15 mins passes and she comes back to take our drink/appetizer orders, again gruff as can be. Ok. Maybe she's having a rough day? Whatever. Another 20 mins and she comes back to take our food orders. She brings out the drinks and appetizer about 10 mins later - mind you, it's been an hour now since we were seated. 45 mins later (no joke) she comes back to tell us that one of the ingredients for a dish one of our party ordered is unavailable. They ran out. Ok, whatever. That happens. But it took you 45 mins to realize this? Oh, yeah. And by this point, we still haven't received food, our waters have never been refilled, no one has checked up on us to make sure we're doing alright, and the bread that we ordered for our appetizer still hasn't arrived. Another 30 mins passes and finally our food arrives. It felt like they just dumped hot sauce all over everything instead of actually trying to make things taste good. One of our party members had to send her food back because it was simply too hot for her to eat. Again, no apologies, no recommendations for something else... she did offer to at least remove the food sent back from the check. So around the two hour mark, the last dish for our party arrives. Normally, I don't have the patience to sit around and wait for food this long but it was my friend's birthday, she picked this restaurant, and I'm going to be patient for her. But after two hours of waiting on terrible service, I was at my wit's end. A couple people order desserts to go. The desserts tasted pretty good so at least they have that going for them. But they brought them out on plates, not to go. It felt like we had to repeat everything for them a few times just so they could get the orders right. After another 20 mins, the waitress comes back out to finally check on us. We ask for the checks and try to figure out why our service was so terrible. Her excuse? \"Well, we're kind of busy\" - (by this point, we're one of three tables remaining) \"all of our food is cooked fresh\" - (half our plates were \"raw\" food, no cooking required and every other restaurant cooks their food fresh, too, and it doesn't take two hours to get it). Very lame, very unapologetic excuses. Every time we looked for our waitress, we saw her standing around talking to other staff members. So busy. She comes back out, 20 mins later, with the checks and offers to take 10% off because \"we were so patient with them tonight\". Whatever, it's a gesture. However, still no apology. Maybe she thought that since we were getting the discount an apology wasn't necessary? I couldn't tell you. The icing on the cake of all this? Our waitress was the restaurant's MANAGER. If Stormy (our waitress/manager) is working when you go, don't bother. You will wait around forever for your food and she'll treat you like you're the one that screwed up for coming to this establishment. Suffice to say, I will never be returning to this cafe. Over 2.5 hours just to get food and basic service? I could have gone to the grocery store, cooked all the food myself, made it better than them, not have to put up with absolutely dismal service... and it STILL would have been cheaper than going to this place. This location is poorly managed and there is just no excuse for that."}
{"text":"What a fantastic breakfast! My husband and I were searching high and low in the Ahwatukee area for a good breakfast spot. We recently moved to the area and are not into the chain restaurants or fast food joints. Pomegranate Cafe fit the bill perfectly. Breakfast was healthful and delicious with lots of flavorful ingredients like avocado, kale, pesto and nuts. We had the Green Garden Protein Bowl and the Breakfast Burrito- they were both a huge hit. Cassie, one of the owners, was delightful and helpful as we were making our selections. The restaurant itself is colorful and cheerful. We will definitely keep the Pomegranate on our 'must eat there often list.'"}
{"text":"The family and i come here all the time.  Today they seemed a little off their game compared to past experiences, but the managers awareness was on point, and she made sure we were all happy before we left.  They need to put their biscuits and gravy on their menu permanently!"}
{"text":"I just tried this restaurant for the first time. It was delicious, I ordered the raw vegan sushi and a raw dessert. I thoroughly enjoyed my dish and I also tasted my dates dish which was the raw wrap and that too was yummy. Great service, nice clean atmosphere. I will be returning many more times! BTW I am a raw vegan and have been a vegan for 8 years so I have tried my fair share of vegan and raw vegan restaurants!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!  I am not a vegetarian, but this is one of my favorite places to eat.  The food is consistently amazing and the staff is always super friendly.  Great for breakfast, lunch and dessert.  My favorites meals are the California Love Wrap, Tacos Vivos, Elephant Curry Bowl, Arizona Roll & the Lumberjack Sandwich.  Honestly though, everything is amazing.  Their juices and smoothies are excellent too...my favorites are the Greeña Colada and the Braveheart.  All of the desserts are amazing, but my favorite is the raw Snickers bar.  The coffee is excellent too!  Some people complain that it's expensive, but I think it is well worth the money for quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I was glad to learn that the entire menu is vegan unless you ask for eggs/cheese to be added.  The food I had was just OK.  Ordered the \"Bountiful Bowl\" which consisted of black beans and rice, carrots, avocado, and peppers.  I am an athlete and consume a lot of food, but even considering that, I think the portion size was rather small.  Disappointing.  Left the place still hungry.  My wife had the soup of the day and the Caesar salad which were better than my bowl, but again, the portion sizes left something to be desired.  I might go back and give this one another chance, but I'm in no hurry to do so."}
{"text":"great place!!! the products are fresh and organic. huge different between this restaurant and most places out there. enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The menu is chock-full of amazing ingredients that are tasty and nutritious. They are a bit pricy but worth the money."}
{"text":"It takes 47 minutes to get an appetizer. And an hour and 20 minutes to get two orders. The bread on the sandwich was dry and crumbled off immediately after first two bites. The mixture of taste was on the sandwiches was not what I expected, I couldn't even finish it. The price is doubled than a regular cafe. It's bizarre. I paid for two meals that tasted awful and expensive. My husband and I were not satisfied with the food at all"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try a new place with vegan food, but my experience was completely ruined by the horrendous service. The food we ordered was decent- we tried the nachos (which were okay, but kind of soggy and used a lot of fake vegan cheese) and a veggie bowl (which was much better but not something you can't find at most vegetarian places). The service during our meal was not particularly fast, but average. However, after our meal, we paid and ordered dessert from their counter up front. We expected that we would pay for it and they would hand it to us from inside the glass case. No- instead we waited over an hour for it. I spoke with someone behind the counter after half an hour, thinking they lost the order (why they needed an order to hand us something from behind the counter is beyond me), but the person said we need to wait and would be called when our order was ready. After about 45 minutes, I thought maybe they weren't going to hand us dessert from the display but were instead making it from scratch. Again, no! I was getting ready to walk out of the restaurant and never return when they called us to the counter and handed us our order (a slice of cake) from behind the counter in a box. Why I had to wait over an hour for that is beyond me and I was incredibly angry. Additionally, I was checking my credit card statement after our visit and we were charged an extra seven dollars (presumably for a tip) after we left a generous, undeserved twenty percent tip at our table. We will never return to this establishment and would definitely not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Just found out about this great vegan cafe and took my guy there for a birthday treat. WOW I must have been asleep to have missed this gem tucked away in a strip mall!!  The smell of freshness, a funky and warm vibe are what I noticed right away!  Great food, Pillsbury wines, delightfully hand made desserts and great service!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and was blown away by the amazing flavors of the quesadilla as well as the humus and veggies.  Leslie was so sweet and so good at describing each item, food and drink.  The lemonade was savory to the last drop and extremely thirst quenching.  I would recommend this to anyone regardless of whether you are vegetarian or not as I am not."}
{"text":"We are not vegans or vegetarians, but enjoy all kinds of food!  We have wanted to stop in for several months now and just found the opportunity.   Nice atmosphere, but the tables were a bit crowded together. We were the only patrons in a Tuesday at 10:00am.  We enjoyed the Lumberjack sandwich with egg & cheddar cheese, Maple Granola w/vanilla yogurt and a kid's bagel with avocado, lettuce and hummus. Pomegranate soda and two coffees to wash it all down.  Everything was fresh and flavorful!  The price was right on for such quality ingredients.   We'll definitely be back to try more great items! Maybe take a dessert or two home."}
{"text":"Food is great. BUT.. Completely over priced. And to top that off they recently  raised the prices!! Food comes out different portion sizes every time too..kinda frustrating."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place...one day I will open my own raw/vegan/juicing cafe...but until then...this will do. I only wish they had a Scottsdale location. The RAW TIRAMISU is to die for!"}
{"text":"Some of the Best Vegan food not just in Phoenix but  in the entire USA....and I am a adventurous vegan chef and have tried it all!!!!"}
{"text":"Today was my third visit to Pomegranite Cafe. Good to see it's grown favorably in the last year and a half with unique organic foods. The staff is friendly but unfortunately there is an issue I'd like to address.  I have a lung issue with cleaning sprays. After each customer leaves their table a staff member quickly comes to spray the table down for the next customer. The tables are very close together. When I asked the staff if there was an order to the spray I was told \"absolutely not.\" Naively, I believed her. The spray burned my lungs and I immediately left my table to move about twenty feet away. Lungs still burning I returned to my friends at the table about ten minutes later. During the meal I found it hard to enjoy conversation with my friends for fear the staff would sneak in a spray. When a second staff member came toward the neighboring table my friend spoke up for me and said, \"No spray.\" The staff member (male) respected that and did not use spray. A few minutes later the first staff member came to a table out of my  view and quickly sprayed at which time my friend said, \"No spray, please\" but it was too late. I immediately left the restaurant. This lung issue was just diagnosed this year. No one wants to be \"one of those people\" but unfortunately now, I am. Staff members should be respectful of the customer. I was not respected by the first staff member who sprayed twice at my request twice not to spray. Say what you will, but burning lungs do not make for a restful or healthful lunch, despite the menu."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito was so good!!! Would absolutely come back and recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Came here while driving cross country and sad that I don't live down the street from this place. I would eat here every single day if I could. This was the absolute best breakfast and the best vegan breakfast I have ever had. And they made the best coffee I have ever had. The wait staff was so nice and so knowledgable. Keep up the fantastic work, best breakfast  ever. Definitely eat here!"}
{"text":"Absolute awesome place. We got the parfait, holiday hot chocolate, curry bowl and lentil walnut burger. Nice customer service."}
{"text":"This quaint little place is great!  Awesome selection of healthy vegetarian and vegan food, and everything I have eaten there has been delicious."}
{"text":"If I didn't live so far away and could eat here every day I would gladly become a vegan (except, of course, for some brisket from Little Miss BBQ from time to time!)  Definitely worth going out of your way for.  Everything on the menu is excellent.  If you can't decide what to get, then go with the Rainbow Wrap and Root Veggie Fries.  I've been a big fan since they first opened. They were amazingly great back then - and since then have gotten even better (and bigger - their original restaurant was eventually so well received and so busy they found a way to expand and more than double the size of the kitchen and restaurant!)  It's inspiring to see the hard work and vision of the owners be rewarded by ever bigger crowds of happy customers (thanks!)"}
{"text":"Love this place! The sushi rolls are awesome...! Everyone is very friendly...Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Super friendly, helpful, and attentive staff.  This cafe is so adorable too.  I was really impressed with all the delicious sounding menu options. I could hardly decide!  I got the Elephant Curry Bowl which has roasted vegetables and curry sauce. I chose the tofu and quinoa options. Yum!  I also got a shot of the Brain On which comes with a Pom juice chaser.  My friend and I stayed and chatted for a while after our meal and they brought us a chocolate truffle!   I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for vegetarians and vegans! All of their dishes are creative, healthy and flavorful which can be hard to come by for us non-meat eaters when dining out. I first came to pomegranate cafe about 4 years ago and have seen it evolve into a bustling cafe with more options being added all the time.   I have tried multiple menu items and am always satisfied. I tend to lean towards their specials board and raw specials on Friday which always prove to be delicious. I would recommend their daily soup with a TLT Sunizona sandwich if you're going with the permanent menu. As a caution it is a bit pricey but many are willing to pay since everything is fresh, homemade and they source as much produce as possible from local farms. It can also be quite busy during weekday lunch hours and the service may be slow during this time. With that being said it is always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"On the one hand... I love the ranchero skillet. Its freaking delicious and I have had it more than a few times. Its super filling, and the last time I ate it, I even got full halfway through it and had enough for leftovers this morning. Its well worth the $10.50 it costs.  On the other hand.... If I buy a piece of $6.00 cake, I expect to get fresh cake. Not the leftovers from yesterday that are hard, dry and stale. We took a piece of cake to go to eat later and was given a piece leftover from what I can only assume was from the day before that was hard and unappetizing. We did not enjoy it at all. If you must insist on selling day old cake, sell if for less than the asking price of the good, fresh cake. Its almost thievery to sell a product of less quality for the same price as the fresh product."}
{"text":"OMG!  OMG!  OMG!  I could not believe how delicious my meal was.  I had the Kale salad and Eggplant burger.  YUM, YUM, YUM!!!  Then I had the Papaya pie. It has a coconut base.  OMG!  OMG!  OMG!  YUM, YUM, YUM!!! I mean, ya ever watch Check Please where they do the close ups of the food and it looks sooo delicious and the reviews the people give are so enticing...?  Well, that's EXACTLY what my meal tasted like.   I wish I was being filmed so someone else could do the drooling!"}
{"text":"I went to Pomegranate Cafe today during their lunch rush and it was a fantastic experience.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a smile by the young gentleman behind the counter. We were seated promptly and brought waters and menus. A moment or two later another person came over and asked if we had been here before or had any questions. They told us about the 100% organic and seasonal menu. The Meatloaf sliders were AMAZING. They had the familiar taste and texture of meatloaf. I couldn't believe they were vegan and made from scratch!  I love this place and will definitely be back again. The food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the wait staff are super friendly but man is the service SLOOOOOOOOOW!  I realize that they care about every dish but, their wait times are ridiculous.  You can't be in a rush or on your lunch break when you go to this place.  It is also quite pricey compared to anywhere else as you are getting organic quality food.  Other than that, it is good food.   Everything I have had here is good.  This last time, I got the rainbow wrap but, instead of having it wrapped in kollard greens I got it in a spinach tortilla.  Very good, healthy and filling without feeling too stuffed."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Don't be put off by the pricing it is absolutely worth it. No froo froo meals here- you will leave full, if not stuffed!  So refreshing to find a place passionate about providing quality, fresh, vegetarian food! My mother and I were overwhelmed to actually have a menu where we could eat everything! Not just a side here or there but full, flavorful amazing dishes!  I got the avocado sandwich, Ma got the Lumberjack. Absolutely fantastic!  Service was a little slow, but they were busy and we needed the time to choose, so we were fine with it.   We will definitely be back! I only wished I lived closer! :)   Try them- thank me later!"}
{"text":"I signed up for a Yelp account just to write a review for POM. CAFE. I wrote an email to them asking for a donation for my brothers fundraiser we were holding and I only gave them 3 days notice due to the sense of urgency for my brother.  Cassie from POM wrote me back right away and was so generous in her donation. They even delivered to our event location. She went above and beyond to help a family in need.  Along with her kind heart the food and desserts were incredible.  There were several meat eaters there and they all complimented the veggie wraps!"}
{"text":"Good healthy food with a very friendly staff.  If your vegan or vegetarian this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Pros: Their food looks and tastes awesome! Just looking at a plate from Pomegranate makes me feel healthy. So far everything I have eaten there is absolutely delicious (and I'm not a vegetarian). Their pastries, smoothies, and juices are great, and today I just tried their daily quesadilla...wow!  Cons: As you will see from other reviews, it is very pricey. My quesadilla and a slice of cake was $21 (no beverage included). The other problem is that the wait can be annoying. I typically wait about 10 minutes just for a fresh juice, and yet today I ordered the quesadilla and it was ready in 5 minutes. Maybe it is a sign they are working out the kinks. I wish this place would provide waiter service and use the counter only for takeout orders. That would really speed up the process overall.  Great, local, organic, amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was good...when it finally came. Visited here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and his parents. It wasn't overly busy, there wasn't a wait to be seated and not every table was full. When we were seated by The host, they were out of menus. We sat for a little with only one menu and then had to ask for more after being asked if we were ready to order. The waitress brought us waters but didn't ask for a drink order.  Once we ordered our food it took 45 minutes for us to get our food. The waitress didn't come by to tell us it was going to take awhile until we asked where our food was. When we asked what was taking so long, the waitress informed us there was only one cook. One cook on a Saturday night!! The food was good, not great and it definitely didn't make up for the bad service."}
{"text":"My wife and I were extremely excited to try out this restaurant.  Especially since we have heard a lot of good things about this place and the yelp reviews were fantastic.  Unfortunately we extremely let down. We waited 50 minutes for our food (we had the time we ordered on our receipt). As we were waiting we watched others that ordered after us receive their food. We were also amazed at how quick the 'to go' orders were coming in and out.    Finally our food showed up! My wife ordered a breakfast sandwich that she said was a sold 4 out of 5. Unfortunately her potatoes were cold... to the touch cold as if they were sitting out for 20 minute, the waitress  however did offer to microwave them for us though. My breakfast burrito wasn't bad. I wouldn't say it was mind blowing or bad.   Lastly on our way out we heard the waitress apologizing to an older couple that have been waiting as long as we were. They were offering to give them free drinks and a choice out of the desserts to compensate them for their time."}
{"text":"I've been to Pomegranate at least three times already, and each experience was excellent. I absolutely adore this establishment.  I love the vegetarian/vegan menu and I love that everything is fresh and local!! What makes this place so special is that it is VERY clear that the owners and employees take pride in their work. Everyone is genuinely kind and helpful.  Oh, and the food/drinks = bomb."}
{"text":"I hate to have to give such a low review but it's mainly because the service is just so slow. The food is good but without good service it really ruins the experience. I dearly hope that this improves so my family and friends continue to enjoy POM."}
{"text":"What a great café! Incredibly fresh food that tastes amazing and is probably quite good for my body. I had the garden burger and my favorite part - without a doubt - were the huge slices of avocado on top. I also had \"Cassie's latte\" to drink. I loved it because it wasn't bitter. (Therefore if you like your coffee bitter, DON'T order this drink.)  The menu items were a little on the pricey side (luckily I wasn't paying) but I was definitely full after my meal. I hope they're able to add dinner hours someday!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for clean eating in Phoenix. So so so yummy, I'd eat there daily if it was close and I had $13-25 bucks to shell out on every meal. They're expanding their space once again, but I wish they'd open a second location in Arcadia, folks up here would eat that ish UP.   Service can be pretty slow at times, but I can tell they're making an effort to speed it up, and honestly, I just don't care. Good food takes time and hipsters operate on their own internal clocks, so just expect it or gtfo. Soup and salad lunch is always a good choice if you really need to get in and out in an hour, otherwise order for pickup, make sure to pay over the phone, and take it back to the office or even monge on the patio.  I love the Rainbow Wrap, and the Falafel Caesar. Kale Salad is a good standby too. I wish they'd do a slightly refined dinner service on Friday and Saturdays with a changing menu, but I appreciate that they stick to their strengths, breakfast and lunch. Honestly, I haven't even tried 90% of the menu, but I can say without hesitation that it all is good.  And O, thee breakfast. I've only been there once for it but damn was it tasty.  If you wanna get your inner hippie on, get to Pomegranate. Seriously the best green eats evar."}
{"text":"The food was so-so, but what turned me off was the service. We got there on a Sunday afternoon around 1 p.m. The place was busy. We were told it was a 30 minute wait for a table inside. It was 114 degrees. We decided to take a table outside in the shade. About 10 minutes went by and a few other people came and sat outside. Five minutes later the hostess came outside and told one of the other people who came after us that there was a table available if they wanted it. Our table was right next to theirs. So why did she ask them and not us. But those people decided to stay outside. I went in to use the restroom and there were 4 tables ready. I told the hostess and she said she did not know. Whatever, we got a table inside. what a waste of time. Poor quality and poor service. If I could rate it a big fat ZERO I would."}
{"text":"I placed an order through Door Dash. After a while I got a call from them telling me that my original order wasn't available, so I told them my second choice. When the Door Dash delivery driver arrived, he was told that my second choice was also not available, and that if I wanted to order anything else to-go it would be 45 minutes. This was AFTER I'd already waited nearly an hour for my order.   I understand that Door Dash employees aren't the actual customer, but they represent us. They are there for us. And the fact that the manager of this restaurant, that I so loved going to, treated him and me - by way of my delivery driver - so poorly makes me want to never visit again.   UPDATE: After much back and forth between Pomegranate and Door Dash, it all boiled down to this from Pomegranate:  \"You should ask Door Dash to refund your money for today's poor service.\" (And I did get a refund from DD without having to ask for it because DD apparently cares about its customers, so ...)  Wow.  Passing the buck. Thanks for looking out for yourselves and not your customers."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant several times over the last few months. The food is always fresh and filling. The staff is courteous and accommodating. Today, though they were serving only a limited menu, they made a parfait for my husband to bring home to me, since I am stuck at the house with a bad cold. It can get really busy there, but worth any wait."}
{"text":"Cinnamon rolls are great! Made with spelt, which I can eat despite having a gluten intolerance. They use lots of organic ingredients and are accommodating to changes. Eating out often gives me a migraine the next day but this place never does  - I think because all their ingredients are natural. It's often busy but staff is very nice. Just don't be in a hurry when you go.It is pricey but you get what you pay for. Lunches are so big, I usually split with a friend."}
{"text":"It's good to have vegetarian/vegan/raw options in this neck of the woods; they're not that common.    Raw food can be pricey; some of the key ingredients are expensive and if the kitchen is making items like \"raw cheese\", it's labor intensive.  The food was good to great.  i had the raw tacos and got my daughter the kids scrambled eggs, which seems like a good value for the nice sized portion of eggs, about a half an apple, two pieces of wheat toast and an ice cream cup.  Here's the part that was off-putting:  Standing at the bountiful raw/vegan/gf pastry bar, waiting a bit for the ice cream to-go, I wondered aloud to the manager/owner/hostess (not sure) about how the raw chocolate-looking items were processed.  She explained a bit how it was from \"raw cacao powder\" mixed with etc, and asked at some point in the exchange if I was familiar with raw food diet.  Not quite sure how that was relevant to my question, but it set a bit of an us/them polarity to the conversation.  And yes, I've done 2 longish stints of raw vegan diet.    I pressed on the processing of \"raw cacao nibs\", as I've visited a couple of chocolate farms and the processing I learned of included roasting the beans; they're inedible otherwise. She replied that they weren't roasted, and they're certified raw, and \"oh, you haven't heard of raw cacao powder?\".  Again, fairly irrelevant to my question, and yes, I know it's a common ingredient in raw desserts. Maybe it seemed like I was questioning the integrity of the restaurant, which caused her to be so defensive, but I was asking in the spirit of learning a bit more from a (hopefully) educated raw food professional. I shutdown when she mentioned the beans weren't roasted, bc I know enough about the process to know that they HAVE to be.  It was good to dig a little bit more into the  subject online today, to find out that the questions I asked are actually active debates within the community, ie:  http://nourishmylife.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/raw-cacao-vs-cocoa/  Raw food eating, i think, necessarily causes its participants to be more mindful, and therefore, more educated about their eating and food sources and the processes involved and sourcing.  I would love to see Pomegranate, and its staff, as true educators of this type of eating in the very suburban suburbs that the restaurant is located in.  Unfortunately, this wasn't my experience today."}
{"text":"This place is so epic!  A vegans dream restaurant! The place was decorated super cute, and the drinks/food were exceptional!!"}
{"text":"Wow that was worth the drive from California. Everything was great we all got different things and tried them all. I can't wait to try my Togo burrito.  We had the lumberjack , pumpkin french toast, avo Sammy, and the brunch special  all were equally amazing. We got two juices both so good . I wish we had one in so cal !"}
{"text":"Very good fresh food. Little expensive as expected from a place serving healthy fresh food and also vegan options. There was a long wait. We went on a Sunday morning. The juices menu was very tempting :). We ordered pancake, scrambled eggs, and avocado egg sandwitch. Avocado sandwitch was very yummy. Kids were happy with eggs, pancake, and coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"I should start by saying I am not vegan or vegetarian I just enjoy clean, healthy, local eating and small family business. Pomegranate cafe has delicious food, amazing staff and service and a family oriented family feel. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am a not a vegetarian, but I do enjoy vegetarian food and eating healthy.  I finally convinced my husband to come here with me.  I had a combo with soup and the Athena wrap.  The lentil was was okay, but the Athena wrap was really good.  My husband got the breakfast tacos with eggs (I don't remember the name of the dish).  He really liked them, and they were super filling.  He didn't even finish both of them.      Staff takes for granted that you know what is going on.  It's confusing for new customers on where to sit, where you pay or if you refill your own water or not.  The menu also doesn't list all the ingredients in dishes and the servers don't know.  I asked specifically what was in the lentil soup and wasn't told that it has onions.  The food is really good, but the customer service could use some improvement and the prices are a tad expensive, otherwise it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on Sunday.  We ordered a Buddha's Bowl and a Philly Melt. The portions were satisfying and delicious.  We'd definitely come back here again for brunch."}
{"text":"While the food is decent the service sucks. Personally I hate the place but I'm dragged here each weekend to endure the conversation of a kid working here who tells me that 45 mins is a standard wait for a breakfast burrito. No more. Today was my last visit. Note--Not all the servers are bad. A couple guys here are really good. I know everyone wants to enjoy a mock sausage scramble...but step up your game on service.  Oh and get high chairs with buckles for infants that work."}
{"text":"A fan. Love the place, the staff, the food. Never been disappointed. And I go there at least 3 times a month. Vegan, gluten free, delicious, healthy."}
{"text":"This place is great! Costumer service is awesome especially Samantha she is the best here! I am so glad she is back!! She makes my day!"}
{"text":"This is the best vegan place I have ever been to.  It's high vibe people and high vibe food that is creative and delicious!"}
{"text":"An incredible restaurant! I've been going to Pom for years. My favorite dish this month is the Bountiful Bowl. YUM. I think the service has improved over the years, and I like the recent addition of table service. The desserts are to DIE for, and ALL vegan. You must try the Brazilian Brownie and the Chocolate Pomegranate Truffle. The owners are super sweet and are always around. You can tell they love and take pride in their product(s).  I would like to give them five stars because they're awesome, but the last two times I've felt like the portion was smaller and they completely left some ingredients out of my bowl last time. They did promptly remedy the missing ingredients. I hope they don't do what every other restaurant does and keep charging the same or more and lessen the quality and portion size!   This place is a MUST For vegans and non vegans!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience I first need to start with the fact I'm newly vegan and my husbands not vegan at all the menu was foreign to us and I didn't know where to start we drove 30 minutes to try this cafe and it was well worth it our server Stephanie promptly brought us water made sure we completely  understood the menu  made us aware of specials.let us try some amazing soup made sure we were aware of brunch specials for the weekends and happy hours that they offer  and even all there yummy looking sweets she made a point to make us aware with no pressure to buy  she catered to us it was a 5 star experience I will continue to rave about this place and my amazing experience  I will definitely  be back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite dishes as a meat eater was Shepherds pie,  so since I no longer eat meat I decided to try it vegan style.  All I can say is that it was warm, satisfying and delicious.  I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of flavor.  As far as the cost at Pomegranate's it is pricey but on the other hand you can feed two people with most dishes they serve there.  That includes their wonderful bakery items.  I have eaten there on 3 occasions and each time I have been more than happy with the food.  My only complaint is that it does seem to take a while to get your food which is okay due to the quality, but if you ask for something else, extra during your meal it seems like you may never get it.  Then suddenly when you have about given up here it comes.  The staff there could not be nicer but they seem somewhat spread thin.  Oh and I want to mention almost everything in their desert case is gluten free and the gluten free bread there is delish."}
{"text":"Service is amazing and so cute inside, however I've never been able to order a drink here that I liked! Weird textures on their seasonal lemonades and coffees. They say it's an \"acquired texture\"... Must be!"}
{"text":"I love pomegranate cafe for all the gf options and allergy consciousness. I do wish they were not entirely veg however. When I bring other people there they have no idea what to get even if they love veggies and salad. However i won't be going as much anymore. Their prices are exorbitant now with the expansion $14 for a garden protein bowl. A total of $50 for 2 entrees (the protein bowl and a special fish tacos) and 2 drinks (a smoothies and a kids choc. Monkey shake). I can go to other restaurants and get 6 entrees (much larger) and drinks for the same amount."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I will say the portion sizes seem to be shrinking. We went a couple of months back for a simple breakfast I had coffee that was cold that I sent back twice and I ordered a simple over easy egg with their grain toast anyway It came out to over $20. I had asked for a slice of tomato lettuce and some onions --I was up charged for the slices, onion &  lettuce. Also used to have a delightful kale salad but the last time I ordered it the portion was small and it was mixed with other random lettuces anyway it was very expensive and disappointing at best. It does not have to cost a fortune to be organic and healthy --not sure how this place does so well."}
{"text":"Food sucks for my taste. But the drinks are where it's at. Everything is really fresh and healthy so I'll give them that. BUT $15+ for a drink........a smoothie none the less not even a mixed drink is way to much in my book....."}
{"text":"Honestly the best place in town for anything vegan or vegetarian. You will have a completely new perspective on how flavorful and dynamic food without animal products can be. The love radiating from those who work there only adds to the environment, and my guess is that its all that yummy food and juice. Take a shot of E3 Live from their awesome juice/smoothie bar, and just see how your day goes. Also I don't know of a single other location with two full racks of completely raw, borderline beneficial for your body desserts. With a menu just redesigned last week it is most definitely worth stopping by soon."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast while visiting Phoenix. Hubby had the banana bread french toast and I had a delicious vegan breakfast sandwich I can't remember the name of. It came with a side of \"hash\" sweet potatoes, which I'd normally love, but they were over salted. Service was great - when I told them about the problem with the side, they took 25% off the price of my breakfast, without any protest at all. Very sweet and personable staff all around. I also had a cinnamon roll and a latte - both delish. I will certainly visit again next time I pass through Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We eat here often, and really enjoy the food and the staff.  But come on, turn down the florescent lights and turn up the heat.   And it's time for some decor--the garage sale chic is wearing pretty thin."}
{"text":"Highly Highly  recommended!! The staff is very friendly and helpful and the food.... WOW!! So Tasty!! I wish there was a place like this in every town big and small. Fresh juices, tasty smoothies, yummy espresso, beautiful desserts, raw and vegan simple food. This is how food should be. I can't get enough.  The best part is, a mother, daughter run and own it. I love when the owners are hands on getting dirty. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Love having a local vegan eatery that serves LOTS of fresh, house made specialties. The food is bomb, the coffee drinks too and the deserts are simply amazing! TRY IT ALL!"}
{"text":"This vegan restaurant is by far the best restaurant I the Ahwatukee area. They have a great place to sit outside sprinkled with live cactus flowers on each table. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. What truly takes the cake is that they now we've an option of take out or dine in. The food is absolutely AMAZING."}
{"text":"Had the basic breakfast.  Scrambled eggs. It took a long time for the food however server was cordial.  My issue was the eggs were so over cooked they were a green gray color very un appealing.  The side of fruit was more like a garnishment (sparse).  Too pushed for time to complain and wait for re do.  When you leave most of your food on the plate should be a cue for server to inquire"}
{"text":"Let me explain something to you: I am a man. I like to eat MEAT, and I don't want some fru-fru ingredients that I've never heard about. Don't try to serve me brocolini - just give me broccoli. Or better yet, just give me a small tree because I am a man and when I eat, I mean business.  Due to this, I avoided the Pomegranate Cafe for a long time, because what am I going to do with a tofu burrito? That's not real food. And a taco made with walnut meat? Walnuts aren't meat - they're wood. I don't want that.  Anyway, my wife talked me into coming here, and I have to take everything back. This place has serious flavor - flavor that would scare lesser men. I had a burrito without any meat in it - not even eggs, and it was both filling, and really, really delicious. Also, they have some pretty wild deserts here, so even if you're not willing to try bread made of cauliflower, try the chocolate cake, or even better - the banana cake.  Do know that they are slow - like... extremely slow. If you have the time, it's worth it, but don't come here if you've got somewhere to be afterwards.  Also, they have fake bacon, which is nothing like real bacon. I'm not saying it's bad - just don't order it if you're like me and expect what you're used to.  Other than that, enjoy! And I recommend sitting outside - they've got a lovely patio and a basket full of squirt bottles to ward off any adventurous birds."}
{"text":"My family tried Pomegranate Cafe for Easter Brunch and were extremely impressed. Before I get into the food, let me say that I'm not a vegan or vegetarian. In fact, BBQ is one of my hobbies. Don't let the vegan menu scare you off. The food was absolutely fantastic. They do offer eggs and cheese if you need to get some protein and our server knew all about the menu and ingredients.   My wife and son had the banana bread French toast. My wife is allergic to strawberries, and asked to leave them off. Andrew, our server, actually noted on the ticket that there was a food allergy to ensure no cross contamination. Very grateful, and other restaurants could learn from that practice. I had the cheddar biscuits with vegan chorizo gravy. It was outstanding.   Can't believe I took so long to try this place. We'll be back...especially to try the mushroom and poblano street tacos!"}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW on 10/30/2017: Cassie, one of the owners, reached out to me the same afternoon as my original review (below) and apologized, which I greatly appreciate! She really went above and beyond to make sure that she understood my experience, and we had a nice conversation about the cafe. She was honest about areas of improvement, and explained to me the reasoning behind some of the policies. I was also offered my order at no charge, so I had a chance to actually try them. The cinnamon rolls are MASSIVE, and are quiet good. Thank you, Cassie!  At this point, my impression of the cafe has certainly improved. I was already favorable with the tone of customer service at Pomegranate Cafe, and after interacting with the management, it's all the higher. I'm glad to try more dishes and pastries in the future, and will recommend PC to my vegetarian and vegan friends. :-)  ------  ORIGINAL REVIEW from 10/28/17 - one star: I want to start by saying that the staff is incredibly friendly. Very personable. But aside from them, my experience with Pomegranate Cafe was poor.   I was given a gift card to PC, which I had never tried before, so this was my first (and frankly, last) experience there. I had called ahead of time to place a small pickup order for the next morning. Nothing major, just six cinnamon rolls. I'm told that it's going to be an extra $20 because it's considered a \"rush\" order for not ordering 48 hours ahead of time.  Little weird - and steep - but fine...the gift card will cover it.   They ask for payment information, and I tell them I'll be paying with a gift card. That's not accepted over the phone, and they won't place the order until it's paid for. Okay...so, we get special permission from the manager to order my six cinnamon rolls with an assurance that it will be paid for when I pick them up at 8:30 the next morning.   I arrive at 8:30 on the dot, specify that I need to pay, and the guy (super nice) checks to see if the rolls are ready. They're not. Apparently, they burned the cinnamon rolls and need to remake them. But I'm still going to be charged the $20 rush fee, and they won't be ready for pickup for another HOUR. This was not going to work, since I had placed the order specifically to get them on my way to a 9am meeting.   Long story short: the order was cancelled, I've still never eaten there, and I guess the corrected cinnamon rolls are now orphans."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and the staff is very friendly. Looking at the other diners' plates, it's hard not to want to try everything on the menu. I've had the dragon bowl, curry bowl, green burrito, several salads, and a vegan baked good or two... all were excellent. Their order taking and table service process on the other hand is a complete disaster. All orders are taken at the register and you are given a laminated tarot card of sorts to identify your table to the server. I've never been in a restaurant that takes so long to ring up orders. I'm not sure if it's because the menu isn't conventional and people always have questions, or if it's their iPad POS system or if it's the fact that they have to sort three separate pieces of paper in order to keep record of open orders and sales. Either way, it results in a huge backlog of customers. The tarot card system is sort of funny because there are always servers walking around in a fog with food or drinks in their hands searching for these cards or someone with an expectant look in their eyes. More often than not, you'll be offered food that you haven't ordered before you get the food that you did. Lucky for them, they put out great food, and I'm able to view these frustrations as mere quirks that match the staff's friendly, quirky disposition."}
{"text":"Harvest hash is incredible - ask for their house made BBQ sauce on the side.  Vegan raspberry banana bread French toast!!!  Sooooo good! It's a busy place on a Saturday morning but they work fast and everything runs smoothly. A gem!!!"}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here has been amazing. So far I've had the jackfruit tacos, dragon bowl with tofu and kelp noodles, raw rainbow wrap,  raw everything bagel, love wrap, hummus, and several desserts. I always leave full and happy, knowing I've eaten something made with fresh, delicious ingredients. You can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu. I could honestly eat here for every meal without getting bored. They're constantly adding new, phenomenal dishes as well as offering daily specials. The staff is knowledgeable and will answer any questions you have. They will also go out of their way to accommodate changes or picky eaters. Did I mention the delicious food? Seriously, check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite restaurants.  Pomegranate is place I can go and literally order anything and know it will be good for me. I have some issues with dairy and gluten so its nice to know that I can order lunch and not feel gross after I eat.  I usually get the burger special they have which never disappoints. I also love the breakfast protein bowl and have tried some of their raw selections - all so delicious! Everything is homemade, organic and a lot of the food is locally sourced.   Yes, this won't be an $5 footlong but like others have said organic, fresh food is pricey. I buy it for my kitchen. I would rather pay more to eat food that is good for my body and that is truly natural. Thanks Pomegranate!!"}
{"text":"I happened upon the Cafe yesterday for the very first time.  Having newly found food intolerances, among them gluten, garlic, yeast, casein, dairy - I was very pleased to see the offerings on the menu  that met my needs.  I ordered the Buddha Bowl as a Wrap.  I was intrigued by the TEFF wrap, a nice alternative to corn and rice for us gluten-free folk!  It was incredible!  The food was very freshly prepared, flavorful, and above all \"legal\" for me!  The homemade veggie chips were tasty too!  I will look forward to returning there again soon!  Thank you, Pomegranate cafe!"}
{"text":"I am so happy I now do not have to drive all the way to Tempe or downtown Phoenix to find a place which has healthy food to support my dietary needs. This place is awesome!  They are just coming out of their newbie stage so give them a chance as they are getting busy and also still learning like a new place should. But truly this place is a winner, great food, and wonderful herbal teas and smoothies. They also have raw food amazing cakes, and gluten free choices.  Give it a try....it is not fast food so be patient and enjoy! Hope they keep the same familiar faces as regulars  like to see familar employees. Susan~ Awatukee Resident"}
{"text":"In reading other reviews...some were not so good.. but I really like this place!    Service was good, yes, a little on the slow side...but worth the wait!    Food is fresh and amazing!  I've only been there twice and plan on going many more!"}
{"text":"I love the freshness and natural components to Pomegranate's menu.  The food all has an organic and earthy taste that is delicious!  I will continue to go back again and again.  Only downfall is that it is VERY expensive!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The food is sooooo good and coffees are great as well. Love the deserts too :) I do wish you were open a bit later each day as well"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 10 star I would. This is the only public food place in the world that I trust 100% with my food.  I stumbled across this place about 1.5 years ago and instantly fell in love.  Their intent behind the food is what keeps me coming back.  The energy in the place is fantastic.  They know what they are doing and build up the community along the way.  I will always recommend them to anyone who is health conscious and understands the importance of locally sourced food."}
{"text":"The worst part about this place is choosing what to order. They have a large, creative menu & everything is good. You also feel good when you leave because everything was healthy! They have very friendly service as well."}
{"text":"I like their Patio very much and the principle concept of the place. We used to go there regularly last year. But then we stopped since our enjoyment started to drop out of several reasons: very variable quality of the food and drink items, coffee is very sour, tea is served with cups half filled, very pricy and getting pricier and pricier (a kids milk costs 4 dollar, making it also not a family friendly place), high prices are not reflected by high food quality and good taste of the food, the inside is very loud due to use of juice makers in the open kitchen (I know this is common in usa, but it is just LOUD), sweet items are too sugary to the degree that sugar crystals are felt between teeth, and I find also that service does not reflect the price (for a 6 dollar drink-in latte plus sweet, I would like to have it brought to my table, if I sit outside and not wait 10 min at the counter, before I sit down, almost dropping two items and my bag in my hand while opening the door)."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time the other day, and the food is out of this world amazing! I ordered the Sunshine Wrap with Tofu and Root Vegetable Potatoes, and I have been dreaming of it ever since. Simply delicious! Definitely five *****stars***** on the food.  However, if you are really hungry and can't wait to eat, this is not the place to go. It took us 40 minutes to get our food which seemed a lot longer than the staff anticipated because they were very apologetic and even gave us a free dessert of our choosing.   The staff was very, very friendly and accommodating, but the wooden chairs and benches were beyond uncomfortable to the the person with back problems who had to sit for an 1-1/2 to eat. I left there just about crippled and had to immediately head to the chiropractor.    All in all, I recommend this place just for the food alone. They really have some great food and take pride in their menu."}
{"text":"I will try this again.  The interesting food on the menu excited me, but the actually food was disappointing.  I tried the kale salad and it was mediocre.  I tried my friend's BLT and it was good.  I will try again, but my first experience wasn't the greatest."}
{"text":"I've been to Pomegranate several times over the past few years since it has been open. I'm always trying to give this place yet another chance because I genuinely want it to get better but it unfortunately never does. On every occasion that I've been here the customer service is beyond terrible. It's generally the same staff working, including the owners, and every time they've been rude, unpleasant, and unhelpful to a point where I feel extremely uncomfortable. The reason I've tried giving this restaurant more than one chance to redeem itself is because of the quality of the meals and ingredients that are used on the menu. The problem? It's overpriced. I understand they're using great ingredients, but I do all of my grocery and dining at places that have the same exact high quality standards that don't cost nearly as much as Pomegranate does. Some of the items I have bought were decent but I've had a few meals from them that made me sick immediately after. I love the idea behind Pomegranate so I hope that over time they can improve their menu, prices, and customer service skills."}
{"text":"Everything about it except for the amount of time it took yo get our food. The lavender coffee was amazing."}
{"text":"Service was really friendly, but the food was a little overpriced. Not my favorite vegan place but still worth checking out (:"}
{"text":"Too bad they put pepper in most entrees. Root beer was tasty. Mac and cheese undercooked and very little broccoli. Waiter very accommodating. Second time here. Potatoes were so peppery my husband could not eat them. Bacon Tempe too salty also. Desserts looked yummy though. Lime lemonade with blue berries was too tart and sour."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this cafe on a Saturday afternoon. When I walked in the hostess was very friendly and sat me right away. She brought me water that was cold and had fresh cucumber- yum. I was excited to try the eggs and since they stop serving those on Sat at 2, i was eager to order. The wait staff kept walking around, helping other tables, cleaning off tables, etc. no one asked me if I wanted a drink or if I was ready. No one stopped at my table. After 10 minutes, I left. Service is EVERYTHING people. Good service will trump a LOT and there was not good service this day. May try again, but disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am from Northern California where some of the best vegan and farm to table restaurants exist. I was happy to find this home away from home. BUT my only criticism is that everything that is sweet is WAY to sweet. They need to learn how to balance the flavors to make up for the of animal fat. Most new vegan restaurants do this and it's a shame because that's all you taste-sweetness. The savory dishes I've had are amazing! Just be prepared for way too many raisins in the zucchini muffins and super sweet parfaits."}
{"text":"This place was a huge surprise and a huge relief!  Being a foodie, and quite the fan of healthy food, this place definitely lives up to those expectations.  If you've ever been to San Francisco, then you'll definitely get that feel when you enter the cafe.  It's got a great atmosphere, and the menu is by far the best when it comes to serving healthy \"organic\" foods.  I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food, but serving \"all-natural\" and locally farmed foods doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.  People that are true foodie's know exactly what I mean.  I ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious.  I'm excited to try this place again."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Nutritious, fresh, flavorful. Five stars even though service is a tad slow and prices are high -- but that makes sense because fresh meals take longer to prepare and the ingredients cost more! Thank you Pomegranate!!"}
{"text":"Okay, if you actually like the taste of good whole foods and fresh ingredients this place is an Oasis of goodness. If your looking for a place that says they make natural foods but uses 2nd rate ingredients and comes up with recipes to hide the fact by using spices to cover it up your better off going somewhere else. My family took me here when we were visiting, and it is wonderful. I had the Pesto Presto sandwich and it was divine! I also tried my family's strawberry fields salad and Arizona rolls. They were all really good. The vegetables were fresh and high quality and the price for the portion and quality was a good price. I was amazed that they had a couple of options for people on the raw foods diet. The juices are different, but surprisingly refreshing. This place is a great example that eating well and health can be tasty and satisfying."}
{"text":"We live about 25 miles from this restaurant, so it took us many months to find an opportunity to eat here.  After a strenuous hike at South Mountain Park, I forced my boyfriend to take me to Pomegranate Cafe for a late lunch.  I saw this restaurant on Check  Please,  Arizona several months ago and since we are watching our gluten and animal product intake, I was excited to try it.  My boyfriend is French, and graduated from culinary school in France.  So, needless to say, he is freaking picky as hell.  Taking him to new restaurants that I choose can be a nightmare.   So, on to the food!  I had the lumberjack sandwich, and since I was really starving, I ordered the kale salad as well.  The boyfriend had the omelet of  the day with fresh herbs and veggies.  EVERYTHING was delicious!  It's a miracle!!  After the complaining about not being able to order a cold beer after our 2 1/2 hour hike, he shut up and ate everything, commenting on how good it was.  This is nothing short of a miracle!  The staff is very nice, friendly and helpful.  I'm in the service business, so I really appreciate that.  The ingredients are top notch, and thoughtfully put together, and so good.  The hash that's on the side of the sandwich and the omelet was so good, I would have just had a big bowl of that!  For dessert, we had the Caribbean pineapple coconut cheesecake and a chocolate pomegranate cake ball, and a chocolate macaroon.   The French guy loved the cheesecake, and he's an expert on cheesecake.  All the chocolate desserts were super good and the coffee was great, too.  I will say we tried Green vegetarian restaurant about 2 years ago, and that was a disaster.  We also went to Santa Monica last summer, and tried Real Food Daily, which we thought was kind of bland.  So to get the boyfriend to try another vegetarian place was rather difficult.   We might actually be back!  Like I said, we live far away, but we could make a day out of having lunch, and then hitting Trader Joe's next door!  So convenient!   Thank you, the staff at Pomegranate Cafe, for putting out such a quality product.  You guys are great!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The scrambles are great but I have a problem with the management. My wife had a bad experience with a pick up order and instead of owning the mistake they tried to push the blame around. So now the wife won't go back so now I take my family of three to The Coronado once a weekend for our traditional breakfast out.   All they had to say was sorry and we'd still be loyal customers."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite of mine. The service is great. I've never been greatly disappointed by anything I've ordered here. They have some delicious raw dishes. They also have scrambles (vegan or with cage free eggs). The breakfast potatoes are really tasty - they are made with kale and sweet potatoes. You can order things vegan or you can get eggs and/or dairy if you want. The presentation is beautiful. The raw desserts are to die for. If you're needing gluten-free, they can also make anything on the menu gluten-free. Sometimes (weekends) they have a biscuits and gravy special that is one of my favorite things. It is a little pricey, but I don't mind. They do have a rewards type card you can get, and earn points for free drinks."}
{"text":"We are whole food plant based, no oils ordered the Arizona Rolls. The nori wraps were so tough you could not cut them let alone bite them. The flavors were good however. Disappointed in the quality. Service was ok. Wait time very long."}
{"text":"Pomegranate never disappoints with their food and friendly staff. The prices are reasonable and there is so much to choose from. Every time I go in there it's always really busy but the food comes out within minutes and its delicious. In practice of being a vegan or at least a vegetarian, they make it very easy to stick to a healthy diet. I usually always get the avocado sandwich which comes with egg but I substitute it with the tofu option and it tastes exactly the same, if not better. Every meal usually comes with a side and they make their own juices right there in front of you, which are also super healthy and delicious.  The Pomegranate staff is super friendly and I wouldn't want that place to do anything different."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is so impressive. It took me forever to even decide on what to eat and drink. This cafe elevates whatever you want to eat to the next level with so many flavor bombs, layers and excellent combination between savory, umami, sweet and refreshing. No restaurant works as hard as this cafe to create dishes that you couldn't even try at home. There is no predictability here."}
{"text":"The Pomegranate Café was recently named \"Best New Restaurant\" by Phoenix Magazine, which is a lifestyle rag for urbanites with dollars to burn.  The restaurant in question is in Chandler, home to many of these people.  However, Pomegranate Café is family-owned and vegan-friendly, so I had to check it out.  Everything on the menu is vegetarian and can be made vegan.  There are also gluten-free and raw options, so there's something for everybody.    The restaurant serves breakfast foods like tofu scrambles, French toast, and breakfast burritos, but when I went, I chose a vegan BLT from their lunch menu.  It was made with delicious smoky tempeh \"bacon,\" and the addition of avocado was nice.  My hot date ordered a pesto sandwich, which he declared pasty but tasty.  Neither sandwich was huge, but they come with a spinach-pomegranate salad and some veggie chips.  You get a full plate of food, and everything is extremely fresh, but I wasn't too stoked on the salad, though my hot date liked it.  It would have been nice to have a choice of sides, like some fries or potato salad or something, but that was not the case.  We also split a berry smoothie, which was pretty tasty.  It was no tsoynami, but...what is?  They also had a good selection of vegan desserts, such as cookies, donut holes, cakes and even cheesecake.  We got a slice of chocolate cake topped with pomegranate seeds to go, and it was delicious.  It's so rare to find dairy- and egg-free desserts.  The atmosphere was bright, clean and cheerful.  It was an enjoyable meal for sure.  My main gripe about the place brings me right back to my first paragraph: everything was sooo damn expensive.  Sandwiches are $8-$12, the smoothie was friggin' $7, and the slice of cake was $6.    So, if you wanna splurge and try a new vegan place on the far east side of town, it's definitely worth a try.  But unless you're one of those rich people that can afford things, you might want to bring a friend and split some stuff.  The food is tasty, but I don't think I'll go back because I wouldn't dream of spending that kind of money on a meal these days."}
{"text":"Wonderful healthy flavorful place. The bowl I had was a taste bud's dream. Right next to Trader Joe's was a bonus."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that the food was amazing! But I am so disappointed in the service. I called in my order at 11:40am and asked if it would be ready for pick by 12:05 and they said yes. I get there around 12:07 and my order is not ready, they said they needed a couple more minutes...so I waited...and waited..and waited. At 12:20 no one had informed me about the status of my order, I felt completely ignored. I stand up and ask what is the status, they tell me they need 2 more seconds and offer me a free desert as their apology. 12:32, my lunch is over and my food is still not out, I tell them I want my money back and she tells me to give her one more minute, runs to the back and come running back with my food. It is really a shame that their customer service was not good today, I was a 1st time customer and was really looking forward to it, kind of crappy that their service ruins how amazing their food is, especially when you have a 30 minute lunch."}
{"text":"Only experienced with ordering cakes from here. We ordered a carrot cake for Easter Sunday one full week in advance. With the cake paid for in advance($70) we show up the day before Easter only to find out that they lost our order! $70 cake paid for in advance and they lost the order for a huge holiday. Pomegranate cafe offered to give us the display cake with a piece missing to make up for the lost order. A day old cake that is missing a piece does not make up for when you are charging that much. They threw in a piece of chocolate cake and some scones to make up for it but when you charge a high price and have people pay in advance, you better have the order ready."}
{"text":"I went here today and enjoyed it quite a bit. The food is fresh, healthy, and still manages to be indulgent. The vegetables are local and taste so good. The flavors they achieve are something special.   For my entree I had a tahini eggplant burger. It came with lots of greens (I think arugula and kale?) as well as some type of creamy sauce and some other toppings like tomato, sprouts, etc. The bun was flavorful and had good texture, something that is unusual for most vegan buns. It came with a side of potato coins (fried potato slices) and house made BBQ sauce, hummus and veggies (hummus was Indian spice flavor and the veggies were bell pepper, cucumber and a whole purple carrot). The hummus was sort of strangely grainy and chunky, which was not what I was expecting. It ended up tasting nothing like hummus really, but was still good as a veggie dip. The vegetables were crisp and fresh.   We ordered a tiramisu (layers of coffee cream, date nut layers and cream) which was incredibly delicious. I am not vegan and normally approach vegan baking with a lot of skepticism as it is often far out of my comfort zone, but as long as you have an open mind, you'll be pleasantly surprised with what Pomegranate has to offer. The tiramisu tasted like coconut, coffee, cream and HEAVEN. The layers of date nut stuff were slightly chewy and had a vaguely caramel like flavor. It came with some chocolate sauce and strawberries and was on the whole really good.  However, there are some downsides to the experience. The atmosphere is cute enough but it was crowded, noisy, and the space is not that large. The decorations are bright and cheerful but it had a vaguely cafeteria-ish vibe due to the tables being very close together. Water is self-serve. You order at a counter and the service is similar to other fast-casual places. We ordered the tiramisu for dessert and it never arrived, and we had to go back to the counter to ask for it. We waited for another long time and finally someone came to tell us the tiramisu was frozen, and that we could eat it frozen or try something else out of the dessert case.  While it wasn't a problem for it to be frozen, the whole losing our order and then not having the item in the correct condition was frustrating. While at the counter, another person had the same thing happen to their group as well.  The prices are also really high for the portion size. I get that the food is really high quality, and it certainly tastes like it, but my burger was the size of a regular burger and cost $12. With tax and tip my bill came to more than $15 just my entree and a glass of water. My friend picked up the tab for the dessert, around $4-5, and her breakfast platter entree was $10 so her bill was about the same.  Overall it was a good experience and I liked the food, but for the price, I am hesitating on whether to go back or not."}
{"text":"Wonderful! I wanted to go out to eat with a friend who is gluten free and this place hit the spot. She felt like she had so many options and went with the mac n cheese. I really love the atmosphere of the place. The only confusing part is if you should get a number from the register, or sit down and have your own server. I highly recommend the grilled cheese with veggies, delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the restaurants on 7th! I went with my mom, a vegetarian, and we had an awesome meal. Normally it's hard to find options that she enjoys and Pomegranate Cafe was overflowing with them! Everything on the menu looked fresh and delicious. We both ended up ordering bowls but are excited to return to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious! Try the banana bread French toast! OMG! It's heaven! And their smoothies are amazing! I found this place looking for a healthy breakfast. I drive over an hour just to eat here."}
{"text":"Suhhhh good. Tad 'spensive, but worth it for the quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan food!! So far I've loved everything I've eaten here! Nothing is sub-par, you can tell they put a lot of effort and time in everything they make, with fresh ingredients!! I adore the atmosphere as well! They've expanded a lot and now include an area where you can buy produce, grab and go items, and little trinkets. The fried tofu avacado breakfast sandwich is amazing, definitely try it! The staff is also incredibly friendly and knowledgeable! Pricing is also more expensive but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Excellent menu of diverse foods. Great place for anyone with any food allergies or that practices or interested in a healthy organic diet. The staff are nice and the food is excellent. It's pet friendly on the patio and the atmosphere is nice and its location you can't here Chandler traffic at all."}
{"text":"I hate giving this place a bad review, because the concept is so great.  Healthy food in Ahwatukee.  We were excited to go try it.  But since I'm so sensitive to things, we just got some appetizers to see how it went.  It was delicious.  A little too delicious (the hummus, I think was the main culprit).  We got into the car and went to the nearby park.  I started feeling sick.  Lightheaded, sleepy, out of breath, thirsty as hell.  My friend got a runny nose and headache.  He said \"I get a runny nose and headache from MSG\".  I was like \"yeah, I get all these things I\"m feeling, from MSG, too.\"  Now \"healthy\" places like Whole Foods can and will claim there's no MSG in their food, because they use some other kind of glutamate, which is the same thing by a different name (ie hydrolyzed yeast, etc.).  There was no denying it, when we got the symptoms at the same time.   We thought back and realized the hummus was over the top tasty unlike a hummus I've ever had before (except once at a Farmer's Market, and they used MSG, too, listed as \"spices\"). They must get a star, I will give that to their organic juice I  got once before because it tasted great, and I felt great afterward.  But it was a bit on the expensive side."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant go there any time I can get over to that side of town. Can't wait for the new one to open in Gilbert. The BEST vegan, vegitarian food I have had around. What a great concept and love the new makeover of the place. The owners are doing their best to always improve their food and service so give them credit and patience and be respectful of the staff and the customers. Very home like atmosphere. The deserts are pretty amazing too."}
{"text":"I love this place! Most tasty tea in the world. I highly recommend to everyone! Don't be afraid of vegetarian food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for coffee and WiFi,  great spot, cute atmosphere and friendly staff. Menu is perfect for those with food restrictions, though I am not. Variety of salads and sandwiches. The man next to me ordered a burrito -likely a breakfast one? Not aure.. it was enormous. .I bet 6 inches around, stuffed with goodness it appeared. I'll be back to try the menu that's for sure. !!!"}
{"text":"I regret writing this because I used to constantly recommend this restaurant and frequent it. I had multiple pictures on my instagram of their food and beverages. Being vegan I want to always support vegan restaurants but the experience I had tonight has literally put an awful taste in my mouth.  A close friend of mine recently became sick after eating one of their burritos and I honestly didn't believe her. That is until tonight when I took my family here to have dinner. My father had to use the restroom at the restaurant to vomit and the rest of us felt sick to our stomachs. I threw up as soon as I got home.   Why didn't we tell the server? Well we had a conflict with not our main waitress, but the waitress who brought out our food. My father's order was not placed correctly due to miscommunication and the waitress had the worst attitude offset by her snide comments. After that ordeal we didn't need the headache.  The food is also very expensive. Save your money.   Overall? As rude as it sounds if I wanted to feel ill after eating, have terrible service, and waste my money I'd just go to the McDonalds in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"Loveeee this place! Best food ever and SO healthy. I recommend the tacos but it is big you could share it easily.  Super yummy. Wonderful service!!!  Going to be ranting and raving about this place for a long time to come!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous coffee, juices, smoothies, and other drinks.  Definitely of the organic, natural, healthy variety.  Love it!  Did not try any food, so can't comment on it."}
{"text":"I love Pom with all my heart. Never leave this cafe disappointed! The food is beautiful, DELICIOUS, and colorful! I love the staff because they give their All when it comes to service. And they are helpful, friendly, and work hard to keep you satisfied. Your tastebuds won't be disappointed!! Try the beautifully crafted desserts, soups-Try It All!! One of my favorite spots to study, take my friends, and I enjoy the positive vibes!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it.. Tried smoothies and juice, they were really fresh. Also they have wide variety of menu. Everything was really tasty and innovative items."}
{"text":"Delicious, well crafted, healthy food! The options were many and it was hard to decide. Lots of substitutions in case you're vegan, gluten free, etc. Cucumber water, smoothies, juices, and even a huge case of vegan desserts! Peaceful atmosphere and wonderful service. Loved it all-new favorite breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Went here over 3 months ago. Very delicious and plant based. I would highly recommend trying this place out. They have a variety of drinks to try from! Also the ice cream is amazing as well. The pricing is a little high, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"love this place, food is so freaking fresh and good. best thing on the menu is the thai dye salad- seriously so good! except it used to be the mermain salad which i thought was better, so i always add kelp noodles to it to make it more like the old version. the only thing with this place is their service is a little slow, so we only go here when we know we have plenty of time to hang out, never when we are in a rush!"}
{"text":"We went here Sunday and waited over 40 minutes to get our food. It wasn't terribly busy. It was very pricey and in addition I got very sick and threw up all night into the following morning from food poisoning there. I couldn't even go to work the next day and had a fever of 100.6. I will definitely not be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the service and attitude. We used to frequent Pom when they first opened. The owner was always around and she ran a great place. Last three visits soured me visiting again. Still good vegan food, but the bad service isn't worth the drive."}
{"text":"We are not vegans but transitioning to a more plant based diet. I thought the menu was extensive almost too many options but decided on the omelet special. Everything was very tasty for my meal, but my husbands buffalo \"chicken\" wrap was beyond spicy. Our toddlers' meals (Mac and dairy cheese and grilled dairy cheese) were terrible. The pasta was mush, needed salt and tasted strange even though it had real cheese. Her side of broccoli was supposed to be steamed, but was pretty much just as crunchy as crudité.   The service was just a hot mess. Our waitress was kind and friendly but it too over 40 min for our food to come out, with hungry toddlers...not fun!  It seemed as if there were tons of employees but not many doing anything productive. While changing my baby in the bathroom, we asked for soap since the dispenser was empty. No one ever came back with a refilled soap...so had to wash our hands with just water after a #2 diaper.   I'd go back and try something else and perhaps a dessert, but the service was just slloooww especially on a weekend."}
{"text":"Bland food, 3 of the 5 of us agreed across our variety of pasta, protein bowl, and tofu hash scramble.  They reached for salt; I ate a few bites of my scramble, concentrated on the Cartel coffee instead, and enjoyed the lunch group's conversation.  Great concept, place is definitely busy and popular w/ the Ahwahtukee those-who-lunch crowd.  Friendly service, while bussing the tables.  Finished the scramble the next day, with a good dose of chipotle sauce just to give it some oomph."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about the quality and variety of the menu. The knowledgeable staff is always friendly and attentive and will not steer you wrong. Just go! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"cool menu with fresh ingredients, cool concept. One big problem is they are EXTREMELY SLOW! Service and way to expensive. If you plan on going here for lunch break between work you my not get you food in time before you need to go back to work. Plus everything is very pricy, 12-16 oz drink will run you 8 bucks! If you order a meal you will easily run you over 25 bucks."}
{"text":"I absolutely love these types of places, the varieties, atmosphere and mindset. Went here Sunday for brunch and it was very busy, aside from the very long wait to be seated and for our food, the service was great and the food was very delicious! I love the lattes and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow.  Ever have a sandwich that actually makes you sad that you cannot finish it?? Yeah.  That is this sandwich. So damn good.  They took the menu so I didn't get the proper name but it was something like grilled \"cheese\".  I live out of town and I will be dreaming about this sandwich until I get back here.  Dear sandwich with pesto, veggies and toasted \"cheese\", will you marry me??  Oh yeah, potato salad...you will be our maid of honor."}
{"text":"I was wondering when someone would catch onto the fact that we needed a good, wholesome, health food restaurant out here in Ahwatukee!  So many flavorful options on the menu (including delicious smoothies!), which is impressive considering the vegetarian/vegan push.  Prices are reasonable for what a great quality of food you get and the service is always friendly and knowledgeable.  Thank you Pomegranate!"}
{"text":"Great raw and vegan selection.  Brownies and lemon bars are to die for!!!  French toast specials are amazing.  Kale salad is still my favorite.  I do wish they had more paleo options.  I also wish the servers were better educated on dietary restrictions in relation to the menu options."}
{"text":"Pomegranate Cafe is popular-and for good reason. The all-vegan cafe with a few egg and dairy options for less-strict vegetarians had a line out the door, with 10 people ahead of me, when I arrived for Sunday brunch. And that line didn't decrease over the entire hour I was there.  It might be the reputation the suburban success in Ahwatukee, Ariz., has garnered as one of the very rare restaurants that serves a vegan brunch every day of the week. Or, it could just be the spectacular food. (I saw at least one culinary institute coat and I can assure you, these people know how to cook.)  Be forewarned: Dishes here are too numerous to choose from. You'll be compelled, more likely compulsed, to come back.  My dining companion and I had the In Season Scramble-hers with dairy and eggs, mine without.  Both were delicious and accompanied by \"harvest hash\" (a surprisingly balanced medley of potatoes, sweet potatoes, kale, peppers and other veggies) plus toast and homemade jam.  I consider this simply an introduction to the restaurant, which boasts a tantalizing array of vegan desserts (make no mistake: The baked-goods counter is food porn at its best-resistance is futile), not to mention smoothies, raw dishes and lunch offerings that would have any foodie's palate irrevocably aroused.  I'm coming back for the Raw! Lasagne, \"Today's Burger\" (I had plate envy of the diners next to me), Wild Western Tacos and mmm, mmm, mmm, like everything in the dessert counter. (Please, chocolate cake, be there upon my return). If you live within 25 miles of this place, it's worth a trip simply as a dining destination.  To view the menu in depth (warning: not for the faint of willpower!), visit http://www.pomegranatecafe.com/pdfs/menu-2012-fall.pdf."}
{"text":"I love , love this place, I was so nerves about going vegan. The staff there was so knowledgeable and answer all my questions about the food and ingredients. The breakfast food was very good! Taste way better than non vegan places. The buffalo wings are amazing! I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"I feel conflicted about this review.  On the one hand, the food was quite tasty.  I had the happy hour \"chicken\" wings with the sunflower ranch and a Jnantik latte to drink, while my pal just enjoyed a Brazilian brownie for dessert.  On the other hand, our server misgendered my friend calling us both \"ladies\". I found it quite odd and we both just looked at one another quizzically waiting for her to correct herself perhaps. Nope. It was really quite strange.  I'd definitely come back and try more food, but perhaps they could just say \"hey there\" or \"how are you two today\"? Take the gender out of it so they don't make their patrons uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Taking reservations on holidays so all the people who don't typically make a reservation and just stop by and drive over an hour to get there can not eat due to 1.5 hour wait time. It's ok though going somewhere else. Pomegranate usually has horrible wait times just to get what you order anyways so I'll just spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here because I am vegan, although my partner is not. We both enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service.   Pomegranate Cafe's ambience is inviting. Tables outside as well as lots of seating inside.   My honey and I got the BBQ jackfruit Mac n cheese and the Harvest burrito. The Harvest burrito donates $1 of purchase to wildlife which is the reason we decided to get it.  The jack fruit was delicious! My omnivore boyfriend was dumbfounded how yummy it was (mostly the fact jackfruit taste exactly like pulled pork).  The Harvest burrito was a miss, we were both pretty disappointed. The quinoa overtook the whole burrito instead of adding to it.   We came on a Saturday night and the service was pretty slow, but the servers seem like they all help each other out so no one has to wait too long.   Over all super cute! Like any other vegan and/or locally sourced place your dollar won't stretch far. Burrito, Mac n cheese, a shake and two desserts was $50 not including tip. $$   Side note: I got the Snikkers bar, but don't let it fool you the description is that of an Almond Joy bar! I did not read the description and fully expected something of that similar to a known Snickers bar. Nevertheless it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I will never dine at this establishment again. The service I received from a waitress was horrible and very unprofessional. I was made to feel that my business was not wanted and that I had no business making a special request. There is a male supervisor that is very kind and professional there that knew the waitress was giving me horrible service. On top of that the food is overpriced and not very flavorful."}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian/vegan or even just looking for healthy food that still tastes amazing, look no further! The food is phenomenal and the staff is so friendly! Everything about this place is amazing!!  Update: I'm so sad!! This place is no longer good... the last six times my family and I have been here the food has been mediocre. Just came from this place after eating crunchy, cold and char-tasting pancakes and their pancakes use to have the best pancakes in the valley vegan or not vegan. I used to loveee this place! Very upsetting... this food is now everything non-vegans say vegan food tastes like... flavorless cardboard."}
{"text":"Go to this Cafe whenever I am in Phoenix area.  They make great Vegan food and drinks.  Rodrigos rocket fuel is soooo good.  I get it minus the espresso.  I love the Grilled Cheese Napoleon with vegan cheese, very good.  I am already looking forward to my next visit to Phoenix.  I will be there."}
{"text":"I love this place, they have amazing food!  I love trying new things and this place always has something yummy and new on the menu.  The only bad thing I could say is that it's pretty expensive (hence the reason why I didn't give 5 stars).  I only eat here maybe a few times a year because of that."}
{"text":"Holy cow. Shame on me for taking so long to write this review. The place is earthy, a bit hippy, and plenty friendly. Oddly out of place in the urban jungle that is the Phoenix metro area, but definitely welcome.   Some of the menu is raw, but I'm often up for trying new things, so I ordered the bagel sandwich (no onion). This is without a doubt, one of the best vegan dishes I've had in a restaurant, the bagel was more like a flat bread, and the filling was just the right about vegetables, including sprouts and vegan cream cheese. Fantastic.   I'd also ordered a too large bottle of organic ale (excellent too) , and gave the rest to the neighboring table. Finally, I risked the dessert. It was OK, but it didn't matter, the rest was amazing.   Sadly my short time in Chandler meant that I wasn't able to go again. I'm sure I'll visit again one day. I just hope it's not 114 out."}
{"text":"Wow, the food was really really good.  I ordered the brunch special: breakfast quesadilla with tofu chorizo and pumpkin latte.  The food was seasoned so well.  Everyone in my group enjoyed their food.  Busy busy place, but worth the wait.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Waited an extremely long time after placing our order and ended up leaving and going to Mod pizza instead. My daughter also has a nut allergy which made finding a safe meal choice a little nerve racking considering everything has nuts in it here including the kids mac and cheese. Waitress was very nice but the wait just killed it for us."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's just me, but does anyone else have a hit or miss with the salads lately? :( I remember ordering the naked burger once and the kale salad that comes with it was so dry and the kale was almost yellow? Then I've ordered the native cobb to go, twice, and the first time it was missing the guacamole and even when mixing the dressing it was still so dry. The second time I asked for the dressing to be mixed in and it was still dry? Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this place to bits and rave about it! I'm bound to return, but it kind of sucks making the 40 minute drive to treat myself to food from here and I get my meal only to be mildly disappointed."}
{"text":"I am allergic to gluten and eggs, so it was nice to find a place that supported food allergies. However the food was over-the-top happy. That's the only word I could think of to describe it :-). Everything is organic , but they go further in making the ingredients only available in its alternative form. For example, organic maple syrup was the only option. Coconut whipped cream was the only option.  Much of the food tasted like cardboard. I had cranberry pancakes that were free and egg free, vegan, and they were not good.  For someone that has severe allergies and likes alternative ingredients, this would be a good place to go. Great atmosphere, good patio to sit on, but more expensive than the average."}
{"text":"It is hard to find great vegan food, this place is fantastic! I love the ambiance. The rest of my family eats meat but even they loved it. I was nervous about the kids liking it but they also devoured their food. Definitely a place to return to!"}
{"text":"One of my favs! Good vegan food. Good selection. Great soups! Try the mint lemonade. Yum!! Service with a smile. Tasty desserts! I had the pomegranate chocolate cake and it was the best cake I've had in awhile! Fresh fruit is great for those calorie conscience. Outside patio is good for a casual setting."}
{"text":"If you're into healthy, organic/vegan, fair-trade food, this is the place to go! It's generally always busy so I wouldn't say come here when you're in a rush. I have tried several things on the menu and am never disappointed. I'm only giving it four stars though because yes, it is a bit pricy. Still- worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great service and folds.   I loved the hollandaise  sauce.   The pom cooler was way too sweet so i watered it down.    Only bad side-  i do not like their baked goods.  I tried the below:  Almond joy- tasted like it was made with old days Fudge brownie- also tasted like it was made with old dates.   I couldn't eat more than 1 bite.   Pistachio  cookies- THE BOMB!! I love these Pesto scones- these were just ok.  I love the flavor but way to dry.   They crumbled in my hand.    I will be back though i will stay away from the juices & baked goods."}
{"text":"we need more places like this. whole, healthy foods, gluten free, vegan. yessssss! if you're looking for fries and gigantic, unhealthy portions, look elsewhere. the prices are in line with what you get, which is fresh, delicious, healthy, real food."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambiance worth every penny! Choices abound, freshly made authentic flavors, etc...highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not a vegan or vegetarian and that is probably why it took me so long to hit this place. That said, I regret not having come earlier. I tried their cashew nachos and was blown away. I never knew replacing meat with cashew nuts would be such a winning combination. Then came my blueberry lavender smoothie, blown away again. Lastly came my main dish, an avocado sandwich with house-made focaccia bread, eggs (they gave me the option of no eggs) and a pepita (pumpkin seed) pesto. Blown away yet again! Three (positive) strikes means it is a 5-star review here!! Must go back!!"}
{"text":"Good food but the price are a bit too high for the value you get. Do wild flowers bread if you want salad :- )"}
{"text":"The food was good, not great. The service was decent. 2 Juices, French Toast w/eggs, nachos, and a bowl of yellow curry with rice and veggies came to ~$70. The food and service deserve 3.5/4 stars, but you do healthy eating and the planet a disservice with food priced like that. There is no way the ingredients used cost more than 10 dollars. If they cared about the planet they would set a price point which more people can afford. I hope they at least pay their servers 15-20/hr. That being said I would never mention any of this, if I didn't see all this big talk of helping the planet and animals out in their menu. But if you're going to use that as part of your schtick you'll be judged on it. People Planet Profit, talk is cheap."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype!  I'm a carnivore that is still impressed by a great vegan or vegetarian meal. I gave Pomegranate several opportunities to see why it was ranked at 4 stars. The final time was the last straw. This place failed on all accounts.   This review is for the last time I was there for breakfast, which was a few months back.   1) The prices are way too high. For some reason, restaurant owners seem to do this to make patrons feel like it is higher quality. Far from it in this case.   2) The food took forever!!!  It wasn't that crowded. But they had plenty of staff and it's not incredibly involved food to make. Most of it is not even cooked!  3) Even though we were there for ages, we were rarely checked on by our waitress.   4) By the time our food showed up, it was cold!  I'm not a huge fan of cold scrambled eggs.   5) This last part still blows my mind. My girlfriend ordered a blended drink with her meal. Several sips in she had a major reaction. She grabbed her mouth in pain. There was a sharp plastic shard in her drink that sliced into her gums. I asked for a manger who explained that it was probably from the container of one of the ingredients. She then proceeded to give us a gift card that had $25 written on it. She did not offer to cover our $70 breakfast!!!  The real kicker is that we went to redeem the card later on 2 frozen drinks only to find out that the gift card value was only $15 even though she had written $25 on the card. The drinks that we ordered were both so gross, that we threw them out.   Trust me, don't believe the hype.  Just because it's trendy, doesn't mean it's good."}
{"text":"Gluten free options!    Have been going here awhile and finally decided to write a review.  The atmosphere is cheery, bright and casual.  If your looking for meat of any type this would not be for you unless you want to trip something different.  The raw tacos with the walnut meat are very tasty.  In fact anything with the walnut meat is good.  The bountiful bowl is another winner and you can have quinoa or brown rice in it.  They have many different excellent juices or smoothies to pick from as well.  Since they have a lot of raw desserts it gives a person who is gluten free many delicious options.  My favorite is only made on Fridays and is the tiramisu.  With the exception of the crust is even rivals the gluten version as far as flavor goes.  They are a bit pricey, but since quality matters to me I don't mind paying for it. Should you go always check their hours first because they change at times as they have experimented staying open for dinner.    Customer service is very good.  They want your experience to be good and have you return.    The one recommendation I would make is they really need to keep the bathroom clean!  They have one unisex bathroom with just a very small trash can that is often overflowing and unsightly.  It is actually a good size bathroom, but they have no shelf or some type of table for ladies to place their items on.  They have a small hook on the wall, but if you don't have something with straps then you have to place it on the dirty floor.  Also really please clean the sink."}
{"text":"Another year has passed since my last review and the Pom is still the best restaurant around. Whether you are vegetarian, vegan or not this is a wonderful place to get some grub. The entire staff is incredibly friendly and helpful whenever I venture in for breakfast or lunch.  There are lots of new faces here now, but the service and friendly vibe are all still in full force. They always seem to know everyone. They have a dedicated following, but they are just as nice to new comers. I try and bring all of my friends and family even though none are vegetarian.   They have seriously killer breakfast foods. The top being the Lumber Jack Sandwich though their breakfast specials have never disappointed me. Be on the lookout for their special pancakes and the vegetarian \"Sausage Biscuits\" and gravy. My personal favorite lunch food is the RAW Tacos which have walnut taco meat ( yeah I know it's still fantastic).  They are the offspring of amazingly delicious mexican food and a salad.  If you don't know what to get just ask. They are always super helpful at explaining things and making great suggestions or just get something from the vegan desert case everything is awesome.  Try:  - Lumber Jack Sandwich - RAW Tacos - Mocha - Breakfast Specials - Passion Juice - Chocolate Banana Muffins - Snickers Bars - Hummus"}
{"text":"I recommend eat here when you're dining in, NEVER order to go. The wait is ridiculous when you order to go. I had to wait nearly an hour on a Tuesday around 6:45pm.   I've had brunch and juice here before and it's been delicious. Last night I ordered sandwiches and they were quite gross. I also ordered a cupcake and I gagged it down just because my bill was about $45. I probably won't be back except for their juice or brunch. Way too expensive for the taste of food."}
{"text":"Even meat eaters will seek this place out if they are adventurous enough to give it a try. Vegans will Love love it.  Everything I've had has been excellent. Some faves: * TLT *Vegan  grilled cheese  napoleon  * salads...ALL of them!  Native Cob with \"chicken\" is a standout * elephant  bowl * CA  Love Wrap * sliders & quesedillas no matter what the fillings are!   The best part....no animals have to die!"}
{"text":"Much improved over first visit! Had the vegan fettuccini Alfredo mushroom . Very tasty."}
{"text":"Phoenix location is Open!  Was feeling a bit low energy today but came here and feel much better!  So glad I don't have to drive to Ahwatukee!!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning brunch is best the time to come here. Such a happy, calming atmosphere and love that they move at a slower pace here so it really forces you to be present for a whole meal. It is busier on weekends for brunch but worth the wait. All their food is amazing and made with great ingredients. Coming here is like going to a wellness center, just doing something good for myself. Love their pancakes and breakfast sandwiches. Really filling and delicious. So far I've tried lemon blueberry pancakes and rocky road. The rocky road pancakes were so good but be ready to share because they are super rich, chocolatey, and basically dessert. I got tofu scramble so I could have a bite of something savory too. Besides their brunch menu I've also tried their desserts. When you walk in they have a case of raw cakes, muffins, cupcakes, and chocolate desserts. I usually don't like raw desserts much but everything they have is so good."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Pomegranate Café. The food is delicious and the people who work there are nice."}
{"text":"This place has the best dang chilaquiles ever! Also fresh lavender kombucha. Service is excellent! The food is so filling too, that's good wholesome food for ya  I wish they had one in Scottsdale coz it's a drive but TOTALLY worth it."}
{"text":"A new favorite!!! Delicious! Fresh & full of variety. Especially enjoyed the raw tacos & vegan pizza. Pricey but its all organic and a better serving size than some other gourmet joints."}
{"text":"The four of us were very excited to try this place as one of them had been to another location.  Long story short......food was just ok.....th service was terrible.   It took forever!!!!!!  Waitress would walk by and not even acknowledge us.....I was facing the kitchen and saw 3 plates of food sit on the counter for over 15 minutes band fore it was brought out. It wasn't even that busy!!!  Sorry ....won't be going back.  Too many other options!"}
{"text":"The food is ridiculously overpriced. $10 for a smoothie? You have got to be kidding. It does have a nice ambience though and the food is decent, but way too greasy."}
{"text":"If you are vegan or a veg-curious, Pomegranate Cafe is the best hope you have to stick to your new-found diet.  The staff and owners are passionate, intelligent, and incredibly hardworking.    Look folks... in order to be able to make as much fresh food as this place does, it is going to cost a lot on overhead.  Just to carry all of the fresh veggies and fruits for smoothies and juice has to be a fridge jenga feat on it's own.  Most restaurant owners do not care enough about their regulars to make this a reality.  To be completely honest, Pom is undercharging on most of their pastries and juices which is why I am totally blown away by their customer service.  What's that?  You used to eat cheesecake while watching Oprah in the 80's but you can't do it anymore because your trainer said that those days are over?  Well, then you should eat the delicious RAW VEGAN CHEESECAKE at Pom (shhh... it's made of nuts and other goodies).  What's that?  You like to go to Whole Foods and pay 10 dollars for juice?  Pomegranate is faster, cheaper, and they use local ingredients when it is smart to do so.  Conscious capitalism indeed.  Oh, you like to eat in unique, vibrant settings?  This place has beautiful colored walls, an open view of the juice bar and clear fridges so you can dine and feel like you are part of the action.  While most places will hide what they do to YOUR food, Pom offers more transparency, so you can rest easy that your food is being prepared with great service and with fresh ingredients.  What is this green stuff?  Look, I have eaten a lot of the stuff here, but STRAIGHT UP, you have to try something that has the cilantro pesto.  This sauce will gussy up any Mexican food dish, a spark for the tip of your tongue, with a small lemon tang, and a nice fresh smooth and soothing swallow that blooms with spice and heat.  And this sauce is a beautiful baseball field green.  I didn't even know that this was a culinary possibility until I ate here.  I noticed that there are some reviews on here about bad service, but I was informed that the space was remodeled about a year ago.  Most of the one star and two star reviews were from before the remodel, which shows how much focus and attention the owners (a mother and daughter that currently work at Pom) and staff have really put into growing as an establishment.  Please, do yourself a flavor, and stop in for a juice or treat if you happen to be in the neighborhood.  You can either sit down and eat a full meal (appetizers, course, desert, coffee), or take a quick juice or pastry to go in minutes.  It can't be easy to offer so many types of service AND be all natural plant based.  KUDOS TO POM FOR SETTING THE BAR HIGHER.  Nom Nom Pom."}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back and try their brunch! Loved the vegan and gluten free options. Desserts were outstanding!"}
{"text":"I have to flip a coin to decide between this place and Chakra 4, and even 24 Carrots down the road from Poms. They all are similar in options and prices, but I prefer 24 Carrots as they 100% vegan and a quite bit friendlier. Service can be hit or miss, and there is an older lady that growls at us sometimes -- and I am not the only one that has imagined this. She's been out the last several times I have visited, so I'm happier about that. Yes, they are pricey, but in line with their competition. Parking can be a PITA during the weekend. Seems to appeal to the ladies brunch crowd, but the estrogen decor is not out of control."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! This place is absolutely amazing. The food is healthy and delicious. I haven't tried everything on the menu, but the gila monster nachos and veggie wraps are amazing. I hope they open up more locations in the valley!!!"}
{"text":"Local, organic and delicious! I've been a frequent customer for years and the food is always delicious, and the staff is always friendly and personable. There's no way you'll regret giving this place a try!!"}
{"text":"For those of you who just like your facts/ info short and sweet, here you go: -It is a locally owned (family owned too) & operated cafe! -Located in Ahwatukee (...imagine that!...of all places;-) -Offers a truly magnificent selection a FRESHLY made items:  tea, fresh squeezed juice, coffee, brkfst foods, lunch items, (\"healthy\"/wholesome) treats / desserts, and so very much more... -Very reasonably priced items -Great helpful, energentic & informative staff!    -You DON'T just have to be a \"healthnut\" to eat here (which it's certainly okay if you are...BUT It's a great place to hangout for tea, coffee & \"people watching\" too!) - Free wi-fi (yeah-true- Starbux has it, everyone pretty much does - BUT Pomegranate is way superior overall in every aspect!) -For more info see their website at:  www.pomegranatecafe.com  - especially for hours, location & menu!  For those of you that need a little more info / aka a bigger -nudge- to be persuaded to try this great place...check out my long winded love letter -oh, I mean overview. I hope you find it to be honest, humorous & helpful:  Pomegranate Cafe' is sincerely a WONDERFULLY delightful place! ....& it is truly a DREAM COME TRUE! The the newly decorated window of this awesomely vibrant, yet quaint and cozy cafe reads 3 simply lovely words:  *Local* Seasonal*Organic   The day that I saw this sign I knew I was in love...or- that a small piece of heaven had quite literally landed in my \"backyard\" (-aka it's just a few blocks from my home! yippee!). I then sighed with an unmistakable sense of  \"finally, a breath of \"fresh air!\"...in a world of lack luster fast, processed foods- a place I can go to be free from it all...close to home.  A locally owned cafe of this high quality caliber (again they organic, seasonal and even some Live/Raw items), comfort and affordability I feel is very a rare thing...Not forgetting to mention that  this cafe is NOT located in Downtown/ Metro PHX...It located in Ahwatukee! It's right next to Trader Joe's on 38th & Chandler Blvd!     This place will be mos def. be my \"hangout\" from now on, whenever possible- until I either leave PHX, or pass into another life! I am only 30- so I hope that it isn't the latter! By the way, in jest- I told the owner, Cassie that if I could I would love to just sign over my paycheck to her, & I meant it! She would only have to share it with a few other fave places like Changing Hands Bookstore,Trader Joe's,W.Foods & Agritopia(& Joe' s BBQ), (& the local farmer's mkts.)! Well, since that isn't possible of course I will just have to continue to support this little awesome local business in any way I can!  Which bring me to the last, but certainly not least... Mentioning of he cafe's {glorious} offerings! Seriously. I mean this...Sincerely superb!!!! Everything on the menu is so very fresh and equally fresh tasting! I would be hard pressed to think that anything you could ever order from Pomegranate to be any less than perfect & enjoyable!   My very first visit, on their {soft} opening day- I had a severe cold and the nice young lady / staff made me an herbal tea called \"Vitali-Tea.\" After that very 1st visit- I was truthfully dumbfounded and struck down by the very feeling of unadulterated *love* embodied by a physical place! I counted the days until I could make the time to visit again! My 2nd visit was actually just yesterday. I hadn't eaten anything in the morning, it was way past lunch & and I was extremely hungry! I was also very tired from a company mting- which was in freaking Peoria! (grrr!)- & as I passed by Phoenix's demure skyline (*i'm from NWI/ Chicagoland area*) my tummy & mind wandered through the \"Roosevelt Row\" area of metroPHX... However, I was drawn closer & closer to home in Ahwatukee, not just by the promise of sleep but also by the overwhelming desire to visit Pomegranate once again. I stepped in the Cafe' with a big appetite and little desire to spend a great deal of $...Pay day, bills and such...pending...a horrible concoction...So I decided on the quiche of the day which came w/ a (phenomenally fresh) house salad. I then splurged and opted for some energy in the form of a cup of fresh-squeezed juice drink called \"Laughter.\" I broke out my net-book, sat down to eat....And my mouth was over taken by the fresh flavor of each individual item that I ordered as I ate it. Complete taste bud loveliness...and overload at the same time! I kid you not! I even had tea & dessert! I sat for at least over an hour, eating slowly enjoying eat bite. Computer screen blank. I just read the drink menu instead (...also i forgot my log-on password btw-lol!)..yet...I was still amazed as I throughly read through each drink description. The drink offerings / menu are the size of a \"normal sized\"/8x12 food menu. The mind blowing variations of teas, fresh squeezed juices & even elixirs on both front and back.  And that's just the drinks! The food is amazing!  \"Love\" awaits you too! ;-)  Gottah go!  Sincerely, S."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant! I frequent here at least 5 times a month. They have the best green juice, chai latte, iced tea and ALL the food!!! There has been nothing that I don't love. My favorite is probably the power bowl because they make the BEST homemade pesto. Also, their sweets are INCREDIBLE and gluten/dairy free!!! Amazing! I wish I could afford to eat here everyday lol! Just a little tip......the service can be kinda slow because they are making you extra fresh and delicious food but just know that going in. It is not a quick dining experience but totally worth it :)."}
{"text":"SUPER APPRECIATION for local produce distributors in the form of edible ARTWORK.   If you value yourself, I highly recommend Pom everything!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you are vegetarian or vegan... or just want a vegetarian or vegan meal. However if you're just looking for a breakfast/brunch place... I think it's overpriced. Went on a Saturday, the day before Father's Day at about 10am and the place wasn't crowded. The service was adequate and it was good vegetarian fare..."}
{"text":"Food is amazing - the deserts are out of control. You can feel good about downing really tasty food and sweets. Love that you guys opened in PHX!"}
{"text":"So far I've only been to this place one time but it was pretty awesome. I had a caramel latte and it was the best latte I've ever had. This place makes their OWN CARAMEL!  Heck yeah! The coffee guy was super friendly and remembered the friend I was with and everyone else who worked there was also very friendly. Go check this place out!"}
{"text":"Tried the new location today for lunch. Pom teas, hummus app, dragon bowl and \"chicken\" taco bowl (can't remember the menu name). All AMAZING! The service was great, so if they got off to a rough start as other reviews had mentioned, it was fixed today. We had the lemon bars for dessert. Fresh, filling, healthy. Both my friend and I were so full but couldn't stop eating. Even if you aren't a vegan, this is good stuff."}
{"text":"Vegan, gluten free options, organic! Excellent place, great food, deserts and juices. In the past I've had hard time finding good food in Phoenix. Not now, definitely added to the list of places I will eat at."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch and the food is always delicious. It's a bit on the pricey side for veggie fare, but I just tell myself I'm back in Los Angeles and get to enjoying my iced Pom milk latte with my $14 breakfast bowl. The coffee is really great, especially when it includes their house blended non-dairy milk. I tend to like the breakfast options more than lunch, the Pom Muffin, bowls, and scrambles always well cooked and tasty. For lunch, the nachos....are not good so avoid those, and get one of the salads, bowls, or sandwiches instead. Service can be a tad spastic, and you do have the sense that the regulars get way better service post-yoga class than any newbies in town. They have a lovely pastry/dessert case up front, too, so grab a gluten free power bar, a cup of coffee, and get prepared to eavesdrop on people extolling the virtues of hot yoga and wheat grass."}
{"text":"Organic, seasonal, vegetarian and local - music to my ears!  Plenty of indoor seating and quite a few tables outdoors (though you can't sit outside if you order alcohol...just yet. I overheard that they will be building a contained area).   Extensive menu full of vegetarian and vegan options. I was spoiled for choice! I asked the server to recommend a smoothie and he suggested the Greena Colada - great selection; it was delicious although rather pricey at $10 for a glass. Yikes.  For eats, I ordered the Big Kahuna burger (sweet potato and black bean) in a collard wrap with root veggie fries and pom bbq sauce. Again, I thought it was a little pricey at $14 but I have to admit that it was tasty and filling.  It might not be a place that you could afford to eat at regularly, but it definitely is worth a trip once in a while. Tasty food, incredible selection, vast drinks menu (including a few organic beers), and we had a super friendly and helpful server. Oh, and their restroom is cute!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open and finally got my chance to visit it this morning.  In fact I'm sitting in it right now.  The name attracted my attention.  I'm all for Pomegranate anything (When pomegranates are in season, I generally eat 2-3 a day..yummy)  I'm having their Compassion (one of my fav words) juice...Fresh organic beet, orange, ginger and carrot juice, freshly squeezed...The glass is a deep red luscious looking juice with a slice of lemon riding shotgun.  Very tasty... Come and get one!  The rest of the menu looks very interesting as well.  A fresh beet, baby arugula and goat cheese salad sounds like it belongs in my belly.  Soup of the day is a creamy carrot and parsnip.. I just had my steel cut oats with goji berrys, ground flax seed, almonds, raw cacao nibs and mila at home.. If it wasn't for that, I'd been grubbin' some of this grub!    I mean.. are you getting hungry yet!  I know you hate visiting Ahwafakee but if you find yourself in my part of town for any reason.. drop in on this place.   This one's a keeper!"}
{"text":"Yummy for vegan all natural organic eatery. I've been here before but didn't get a chance to eat so I finally made a point to do so for a late lunch. Where to start? Menu: food menu and drink menu (healthy drinks) were plentiful! I had no idea what to choose for either of them. I finally decided to go for the supreme burrito and the blue lagoon smoothie.   Supreme burrito = grilled spinach tortilla stuffed with brown rice, kale, carrots, zucchini, other farm veggies, beans, cheese and guacamole and cashew sour cream. Smothered with enchilada sauce with a side of purple cabbage ginger slaw and a couple slices of oranges. Not sure if I could really taste that but sounded so unique! This can definitely fill a hungry man's stomach if he's not the type to eat healthy food. $14  Blue lagoon smoothie = blueberry. pineapple. Spirulina. Chia. Kale. Coconut h2o. Brain on (helps focus. de stress. Lifts mood). Topped with a couple frozen blueberries and a couple squares of pineapple. This was surprisingly  blue-licious!! $14 - yes $14 for a drink!! Better have had given me all those health benefits!  Baked goods = seasonal pomegranate cake and their thick chocolate chip with oats, walnuts and choc chip! $8 and $3 respectively.   All in all this place was quite delicious and healthy. Servers were nice. Waters were given in jars and to go cups. You can enjoy eating outside as well as inside. One part of my food had a possible hair but I think I will try to ignore that part..  Minus that tidbit of un-welcomed thing I will give it another shot. The desserts and drinks are begging me to come back."}
{"text":"Siiiiiigh, I wish it were in my neighborhood. But I still drive half an hour just for their curry dish and rainbow salad. MMMMMM!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pomegranate's savory dishes that I've tried have all been amazing.  Their sweet dishes, on the other hand, are hit or miss.  Their Love the Whales Mac & Cheese bowl is probably the best vegan mac & cheese I've ever tried.  The portion size is huge and I split it up to last me three meals.  Their raw tostadas were absolutely incredible.  Every time I go there I look for this in the raw case, but alas, I've only been able to find it once.  Again, a very generous portion.  You can easily get leftovers from most of their meals.  The quesadilla was also good, and the tofu scramble is all right.  Tasty but nothing special.  Their coffees, however, have all been...well, bad.  I've tried a latte, a mocha, and the coconut caramel latte.  The coconut caramel latte was all right, although definitely not a favorite.  The latte and mocha were leaning toward the nasty side.  Their pancakes and French toast are a bit dry and not as fluffy as I would hope.  The cinnamon rolls, on the other hand, were great.  The chai muffin was all right, but cloyingly sweet.  In short, stick with any savory items you find on the menu, and if you're craving sweets or coffee, go to Nami instead."}
{"text":"I am so excited for this place! I was just talking with Brady K. about how the Valley needs more breakfast/lunch cafes with character, and for sure Pomegranate Cafe delivers.  They have an extensive juice and smoothie menu, a plethora of unique teas, and ubber yummy breakfast, lunch and confection options.  Best of all, they use local, organic produce from the farms at South Mountain, and make all items on premises...including their almond milk!  Seriously, I love it!    Make sure to say hi to Matt when you go in.  He manages the joint, as well as bakes and makes the almond milk.  Best of all, he is great with names and conversation, so you will feel like you are old friends and you have been going there for years even though it just opened about 6 weeks ago.    For this visit, I had the white peony tea, which has a very delicate flavor and an essence of apples.  Brady K. ordered the Wild Western Tacos, and oh, my, God!  they looked awesome.  Huge portion.  Two stuffed to capacity spinach tortillas with scrambled eggs (or tofu is an option), zucchini, avocado, heirloom tomatoes, sharp cheddar.  Pomegranate Cafe offers good home cooking taken to the next level.  Imagine you had a professional kitchen with all the goodies and could just get nuts with ingredients and creativity.  It's kinda like that.  The kind of food people make because they would actually eat it, not because it's a job.  I can't say enough about this place.    Also, all drinks ordered to stay come with a yummy little cookie.  It's the little things that make a place great!  Today's cookie was an almond cookie made with maple syrup and the almond pulp left over from the latest batch of almond milk.  When I asked Matt if he had culinary training, he just said, \"I like to do stuff.\"  Simple answer, and the awesomeness of his enthusiasm to create is apparent in everything we experienced about this place.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was the first Breakfast stop on my little tour of PHX. EVERYTHING was ALL so VERY FRESH!!!   Started with a fabulous \"Americano\" to quench the tired off, followed up with \"The Avocado Sandwich\" and joined by an amazing \"Rainbow Salad.\"  To this day, it was the BEST \"Sunflower Ranch\" dressing I've EVER had.  If only, I had room for dessert. :)  Perks: Parking Lot, Prices, Portions, Clean Bathroom  Eating Out With A Girl #EOWAG #EatingOutWithAGirl dot com"}
{"text":"We've been here twice for breakfast. What I love most about this place is that it is 100% Vegetarian with almost everything on the menu having the ability to be made vegan by replacing things like cheese and sour cream with a vegan option (I've never been anywhere that actually offered vegan sour cream so that was exciting!). The first time I tried the Lumber Jack - it was okay, but I think the texture of the tempeh bacon is what threw me off. I also tried their cowgirl cookie the first time and it's phenomenal! ALL of their baked goods are vegan (and some are raw/vegan). The second time we went I had their breakfast burrito w/ vegan cheese and vegan sour cream and it was excellent! Also, the teas they serve are amazing. I suggest the white peony - perfect, lightly fruity, breakfast tea. We will be back to try lunch!"}
{"text":"The food there is really good!!! The service there is not so good as the food tho. They are very busy most of the day so it reflects on the service over the phone also....almost always they put me on hold when I can them. Overall I love going to this place :)"}
{"text":"First time here.  I ordered the mushroom lentil walnut \"burger\" on a bed of mixed greens.  The food was good though a little too salty.  The prices are high and the food took quite a long time to come out. My colleague and I were on a lunch break and ended up barely having time to eat and pay before having to return to work.  My only other comment is they should have all nutrition info. for each of their dishes.  I specifically asked for the info, and after checking, the server told me they did not have this info. available.  That's frustrating when trying to watch my intake.  Decent food but not sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"There are variety food on their menus, I love the creativity and diversity. I ordered Power Kale Salad and  AB& J Bow , so delicious food with fresh vegetables . For to keep fit ,you may come here and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area on Sunday wanting to try out a new vegan place. Yelp app led me to 24 Carrots which said it was open but was actually closed! Luckily, Pomegranate Cafe was right down the road so we ended up stopping in to try it out.  Great menu and friendly staff. The food was good. We got our food before we got our drinks, which makes sense when you're ordering fresh squeezed juices... so had to wait a bit to start eating. The man was thrilled to find out that they offered a dairy version of the breakfast burrito so he could still eat healthy but didn't have to eat completely vegan.   My fresh squeezed orange juice and kale salad (kale, tomato, beet curls, carrots) was a nice, clean and healthy meal to start off the day.  The space was decorated cutely, and they even offer a few products for sale which are great products, such as Sun Warrior vegan protein powder. Will definitely return to try out a few more menu items!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are just a joy to cook for. He's gluten and dairy intolerant, and I'm a vegetarian. Pomegranate Cafe has us both covered with numerous menu choices plus a great dessert case.  I first tried this place with Laura L., and I was delighted with the lumberjack sandwich (tofu and regular cheese) and sweet potato hash . The sandwich was great, and despite the name, it was a reasonable size. I also had a nice latte along with my breakfast. At the time, I paid with a gift certificate so I didn't pay attention to how pricey it was.  I returned for lunch while my car was being tuned up, and I got a massive burrito filled with quinoa and veggies. It came with a lightly dressed salad on the side. I brought home a carrot cupcake for my husband, and he thought it was great. My lunch, latte and dessert was nearly $30.   Perhaps Pomegranate Cafe isn't a great value, but all the food is delicious. It's an excellent choice for those of us with special diets."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, but over priced. It's simple things put together. Service took long for one meal to go. A nice place to have a Sunday brunch though."}
{"text":"I got to check our Pomegranate Cafe for the second time ever yesterday (I know - I can't believe I've only been twice!) I am gluten-free, dairy-free and egg-free, so their menu is pretty much a dream for me. They pride themselves on being able to adapt all menu items for customer's allergen needs, which means that if you are gluten-free, you have an ENTIRE menu full of options! Plus, as most of you know, the entire restaurant is vegetarian and mostly vegan (although they do serve eggs and real dairy for those that prefer it).  I got their \"Raw Green Rainbow\" salad, which came with their homemade, dairy-free cashew ranch dressing. It was incredible. My mom got the \"Garden Green Protein Bowl\" with tofu scramble, roasted root veggies, their homemade gluten-free seed toast and homemade POM jelly. We both devoured our food.  Of course, I knew that I wanted dessert, so I stalked the dessert case, asking tons of questions until I could decide which one I wanted. I ended up with the \"Gluten-Free, Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Brownie,\" which was doughy and delicious. Out of all 4 rows of their dessert case, there were 3-4 items that weren't gluten-free - the rest were!  I truly recommend this place for all of my vegan, gluten-free, allergen-friendly seeking customers. I know that feeling of only being able to order 1 thing off the entire menu when visiting most restaurants, but Pomegranate Cafe brings light and life to dining out for those suffering from food allergies, food sensitivities, and/or those with limited diets.  It's worth the trek down to their location in South Phoenix/Ahwatukee area, even if you reside more North. Believe me - It's a one-of-a-kind experience and worth every bite! Gluten-free foodies, unite!   My only request for future is that they offer gluten-free/vegan cakes like the ones they have in their case that are only vegan (not gluten-free). They are so beautiful, fluffy and decadent looking, I would gladly buy a few slices to take home"}
{"text":"My favorite vegan place in Phoenix. The menu is huge and I have loved every single thing I have tried. Personal favorites are the Mermaid Salad, Gila Monster Nachos, and Caprese Quesadilla. You can't go wrong with their brunch specials either. Yesterday I had a cherry mimosa made with prosecco that was divine. Don't sleep on the desserts either. Make sure to try one of their cookie dough desserts - truffle, brownie, etc.   One note: their service is slow, so expect a leisurely dining experience. IMO this is worth it for the high quality, tasty vegan food."}
{"text":"The place was really cute and the food was good. The host took a few minutes to acknowledge me which wasn't the best, but my waiter was great. The only other downfall was that there was a long hair in my food. I would totally give it another try though because the food options looked great."}
{"text":"Not worthy of a near perfect rating, that's for sure.  Had the lumberjack. It was okay, nothing to write home about, needed extra flavor and spice. Very bland.  Took twenty minutes to get our food. Seemed like a long time since you order and pay and then sit down and wait.  Lastly....Price! Holy crap!"}
{"text":"First ones in the door when they opened. A couple came in 5 min later. They were served immediately and after 10 minutes,  my 7 year old had to go request a server. Still no other patrons,  25 minutes later,  the couple had drinks and such,  we had water that was refilled 3 times.  No drinks, no food,  not acceptable. (Quote from 7 year old) when I asked to cancel our order, the server was annoyed and offered no apology.  Will never visit again."}
{"text":"So many options! Nice boho environment with tons of yummy 'guilt-free' options for brunch, lunch, dessert, snacks.. etc."}
{"text":"Albeit a little pricy, Pomegranete's cafe is the place to go for fresh, delicious vegan food. And you don't have to be a vegan to love this place. Everything is fresh-made, so service can be slow sometimes (and often it gets busy in there, so it's not a good combination) but it's worth the wait. With constant additions to the menu, there's always something new to try. I definitely recommend stoping by."}
{"text":"I'd been awaiting the opening of this new location for months. I've never been to the Ahwatukee location, but have heard rave reviews and have lusted after their menu for awhile. When we finally got to try this place, it was frankly disappointing. Granted, they had only been open a few weeks, so there were likely lots of kinks to work out. However, I'm not in much of a rush to go back, for fear that it will still be disappointing.   It took a long time to be greeted and offered water. We then wanted to order cocktails from their drink menu, and were told they didn't have their liquor license yet. It turns out their food menu was also much smaller than the Ahwatukee one that I'd seen and been excited about.   We each ordered an entree and shared an appetizer, and found all of them to be pretty unremarkable (coming from a vegetarian who loves creative meatless options. Plus they all came out at different times, and in the wrong order. And then the bill was very high for such a lackluster meal and experience.  I hope this place improves, because we need more vegetarian and vegan options in the valley. I was hoping this would be my new go-to restaurant, but not so far..."}
{"text":"What makes pomegranate special is the good service and wonderful outdoor setting the food is unique and delicious and a break from your typical bakery and sandwich themed restaurants.  The food is very hearty and filling and they have large portions. We got the burrito Bandito, and the grilled cheese sandwich, along with a coffee and iced tea. For dessert we got the chocolate cake which was vegan super dense and delicious. Sitting outdoors on the patio was very enjoyable, there are pigeons around that seem like they are regulars here as well and are fun to watch. They have fresh desserts made from scratch. We had to take ours to go because we got full off of just the burrito and even then had leftovers. The service was excellent, I highly recommend the pomegranate café to anyone."}
{"text":"Ok. I visited here on Sunday morning. There were 4 or 5 people other than us in the restaurant. We ordered latte's and a breakfast omelette.   My problem is the length of time it took to receive the latte's. It was nearly 30 minutes. This is ridiculous. The latte was ok but compared to a place like Cartel in Tempe it was substandard and not very robust.  The food was delicious and saved the service and drinks. My fiancée and I spoke about it and will give it another try and hope for better front end service."}
{"text":"I got the Breastfast Burrito sans eggs and tofu because of allergies.. It was amazing!! Their fruit bowl is versatile and fun. Noisy-ish if you're dining in, mostly because of the juicer (yes they juice your drinks right there..) but think of it like a cafe. Fun and original! Great varieties and options for vegans and people with allergies!"}
{"text":"So good! Healthy and delicious food in a friendly environment. Great place to come if you're health conscious or like delicious food. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place - the food, juices, staff & ambiance all kick ass. They've continued to expand their dining area over the years to accommodate more customers and now have full service waiters so you can sit down and take time to look over the menu. My fiancé and I ordered the breakfast pizza special which was amazing. It had this homemade croissant-like crust with scrambled eggs, hash, tempeh bacon & a delicious cashew cheese that has a little kick to it. I would definitely go back and order this again. It's a good size to split w/ someone and have room for juice still. If you're looking for outdoor dining they have a good size patio and its located next to Trader Joe's which makes it convenient to grab a couple groceries after you eat."}
{"text":"After a few straight days of eating pretty poorly, the fella was craving a healthy meat-less meal for breakfast. A quick yelp search for healthy food with gluten free options led us to Pomegranate Cafe. I had a few of their desserts at Sips and Sweets last year, but had never made it out for a full meal.   Tucked away in a shopping plaza, Pomegranate is shockingly spacious. They have a good sized patio that allows dogs, with big roomy tables. At 9am on a Sunday, it was pretty full but not crowded, and the handful of open tables meant we didn't have to wait to be seated. Walking in, the hostess stand is to the right hand side just inside the door. It makes for a little bit of an awkward situation when there are more than two parties waiting to be seated, as there's not much waiting space. The hostesses seemed a little disoriented and scattered, but after a few minutes we were sat and waters (with cucumber!) delivered.   Our server also seemed a little bit flustered, but came over to take our order pretty quickly. I opted for the Avocado Sandwich with Farm eggs (+$1), and the dude had the Sunshine Wrap in the green collard leaf (he can't have gluten) and the rainbow juice. My avocado sandwich was great; all of the flavors played together really well, and in my opinion, sprouts are grossly underrated. My chief complaint about the sandwich was the bread. While it was DELICIOUS--seriously, I love any and all bread, but this was top-notch--it wasn't a hearty enough bread to hold the weight of the sandwich. I ended up abandoning and deconstructing it because the pesto was exploding out of the bread. Plus, while very yummy, this amount of pesto really just wasn't meant to be spread directly on an already weak bread--spread that love between the eggs and sprouts, yo. Super tasty, but not structurally sound. But I cannot fault them for my own sandwich neuroses, I fully realize that I have some irrational hangups. The fella said his wrap was really tasty, but had a similar problem with the wrap's ability to contain the innards. The rainbow juice was excellent.   After enjoying our meal, we took a stroll on over to the dessert counter so the fella could pick out some treats; dairy free, gluten free treats are pretty hard for him to find, so he jumps at the opportunity every chance he gets. We were waiting quite a while before we were helped, and then the employees helping us seemed a little... indignant. We ordered one of the snickers bars, which was clearly labeled in the case; it was very poorly explained to us that what was in the case were actually almond joys, and snickers would not be ready today. That's fine, we weren't upset and we weren't looking for an apology or anything, and totally understand that this kind of stuff happens. But the perceived annoyance towards us was a little off putting, when we were just trying to pick a couple things up and head on our way. The whole process probably took 15-20 minutes.   Overall, food was excellent but a little pricy. Service could use a bit of help. We'll probably be back, but hope the dodgy service this go-around was just a fluke."}
{"text":"New fave vegan spot! Everything is amazing. I've tried the burger, nachos, scones and brownie with cashew butter. Coffee and drinks are delicious as well :)"}
{"text":"This place is seriously one of my favorite places to eat! The food is so good and the service is always excellent, I'm not vegetarian but I still love their food! Their espresso is also absolutely AMAZING! I constantly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Last time I was here I left a 3 star. The owner responded right away & made things right. Today I am here & the food was exceptional as well as the service. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. I drive from north central Phoenix & it is always worth it!! Yum!  Cookies & deserts are the best outside of Denver or San Francisco!"}
{"text":"Good and tasty all healthy options, great vibe. A bit expensive but good food is worth the money. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This spot is one of my favorite restaurants. I love their new expansion and extended hours, especially their happy hour with healthy nachos. My go to breakfast items are the Pom scramble with amazing jam and the avocado sandi. I am salivating just thinking about them.   Every coffee drink I have had is amazing as well and so original!"}
{"text":"My daughters brought me here and we keep coming back whenever I am in town. Clean, healthy, big portions, and made with love. I'm from KY so of course the prices seem high, but the food is worth it. Pay attention to the specials. Smoothie, juice, latte, dang so many fun choices."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!!! I had the Wild Western Tacos and they were flavorful and absolutely delicious. One of the best vegan meals I've ever had (I had it with tofu) and I am definitely coming back! Our waitress, Shelby, was absolutely wonderful and made it a great meal."}
{"text":"I saw this had just opened and decided to give it a shot. I went alone so they sat me at a big group table with strangers. Awkward--I had expected they'd have a bar or a plan for single customers aside from sitting with strangers. Service was so incredibly slow...but it wasn't the server's fault. The juice people were slugs and the kitchen seemed to cook one person's meal at a time.   I ordered a bowl sounded basically like a taco salad but add quinoa and sub the chicken for a vegan option. That vegan option, it turns out, was straight up salty walnuts. Because when I think guacamole and salsa, I immediately wonder where the walnuts are. It was godawful. Half the bowl was occupied by tortilla chips (which I didn't want), and the salad greens were piled to one side where no sauce could possibly be maneuvered to engage them. The whole thing was confused, difficult to eat (the utensils are some weird wood things that don't really work), and incredibly overpriced. Verdict: 2 hours of uncomfortable silence sitting with strangers just to pay $25 for a glass of OJ and a half cup of quinoa with black beans (the only part I could actually eat).   I wanted to like this place but...just yuck.   Fun fact though, you can take home a vegan bread loaf for a mere $17. Are these people insane?"}
{"text":"Good variety of fresh, healthy, and organic food.  Friendly people and excellent taste.  It is nice to go to a place where the food is different and good while the staff likes working there."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh and authentic food! Great quality and a must try!! Love to come here!!   Great vegan and gluten free options too. Not so kid friendly as far as dishes go but gosh love the food here!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Went twice during my three day long trip to Phoenix. The menu is quite extensive, something for everyone!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the list of Ahwatukee food options!  I've been to Pomegranate Cafe a few times now and have left happy each time.  Perfect for that pre-grocery shopping (at Trader Joe's, next door) meal so that you don't go starving and buy WAY too much food.  As the slogan states, and everyone else has mentioned, Pom Cafe is \"indulgently healthy.\"  Fresh, organic, vegan, even raw food options.  Breakfast and lunch, juices, teas, elixirs, espresso, and baked goods.  Walking in, the atmosphere is calm and relaxed.  Walk up to the counter, check out the chalkboard for the specials and browse a paper menu for the rest.  Place your order at the counter and try not to be tempted by all of the delicious looking desserts calling your name.  Sit down at a table and they'll bring you your food.  If you feel like helping out and clearing your table, great!  There is a busing station on the back wall.  Or leave your dishes there and they will clear it for you.  The staff is friendly and energetic; you can tell they enjoy working there and giving you fresh healthy food and drinks.  I have tried a few different menu items and it addition to enjoying good tasting, healthy, vegan food, the portion sizes are quite generous and very reasonably priced.  I have left very satisfied stomach (meaning, I'm full) but not that heavy \"oh-no-what-did-I-just-eat\" feeling in my belly and my conscience.  Feel good and taste good healthful food!"}
{"text":"I'll be very honest.  The produce here is pornographic.  Brightly colored, clearly fresh and fragrant, it looks like it belongs in a commercial and I want to know how to get my hands on my own sexy produce.    Definitely one of those hipster our-forks-are-vegan places but it doesn't matter.  The food is terrific and the dishes are flavorful, creative and healthy.  Save room for the x-rated dessert case.  Even if you're full, you'll want to take something home.    It's a shame I live on the other side of town but I could be easily convinced to swing back by for a jaunt to the Fruit/Veggie Red Light District."}
{"text":"Great food but I can't tolerate poor service. Called in order and was told they were busy. Would be 20-30 mins. Order took an hour. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Good food, okay service, overpriced. To bad, because I would love to go more frequently. Again, simply overpriced."}
{"text":"I used to come here for breakfast when I lived in the area. We usually split the green bandito burrito with kale salad as the side. The salsa that came with it was so tasty -- I would always ask for an extra side!   We also split the berry parfait as our dessert and that definitely hit my sweet tooth. I can't really speak on anything else on the menu, since I get the same thing every time! Highly recommend them both!   I was honestly surprised how tasty the food was. I feel like some healthy places tend to be bland but this was definitely packed with flavor!"}
{"text":"Pomegranate is the local superstar of vegan/vegetarian food. I go at least 2x per month and have never had a bad meal. Recommended dishes: breakfast club is my favorite. It comes on the house biscuit/English muffin and this is a must try, but I also am in love with their house multigrain bread so I'll also get it on this from time to time. I also recommend any of their breakfast scrambles/omelettes. French toast is delish if you're in the mood for sweet breakfast. I'm in love with all of their breads. You'll also want to grab a latte. I usually go for the standard Cassie's latte. Desserts vary and are all good so save a little room. Strangely enough breakfast is so good I've never made it for lunch or dinner, but I have no doubt the meals are great. Customer service is generally great although sometimes they get really busy and appear slightly understaffed. This is one of the few places that I don't feel the need to add the qualifier of its good....\"for a vegan/vegetarian place.\" This place is good no matter what. They are opening a central Phoenix location sometime in the next year are so; luck you central Phoenix peeps. Next time I'm there I'll remember to update with some pictures!"}
{"text":"I love this place! For me, their dessert bar is heaven on earth! I can never have dessert anywhere due to my severe dairy allergy and so this is such a treat for me! Everything is so good. I will drive miles out of my way just to go and get a cupcake after the gym or some scones for the next morning. Try their chocolate pomegranate cupcake and their chocolate pomegranate truffles. Their cowgirl cookies are so yummy, too. Oh, and the best part is you can order a cake!! a delicious, moist vegan cake! I will finally be able to have a birthday cake! Portions are pretty small for the tab you pay, I don't really leave full (especially if I go after a workout). I understand most restaurants serve huge portions of bad food and so we are used to over-eating, but I am a pretty small/petite woman and it definitely doesn't fill me up, but I'm so happy to have something healthy and yummy available that it is still one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a Saturday. The tables were about two thirds full. After we placed our orders it took quite a while to get our food. One of the orders was for a kid's meal (macaroni and cheese). The menu clearly states that the meal comes with fruit and vegetables and a cookie. After the waitress delivered only a bowl of macaroni and cheese we had to remind her that the meal included additional items. She tried to explain that there were no additional items. We objected again and pointed out that the menu explicitly stated what was included in the meal. She finally agreed to bring us the other items. As far as vegan cuisine is concerned, the food was not particularly impressive."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Reminds me of the vegetarian places in northern California. I can't say enough good about it.  They will do vegan or vegetarian but don't expect animal meat here (they do have eggs and dairy cheese available as well as tofu, tempah, and other high protein items).  Everything is fresh, fresh, fresh. You get a fair amount of food (often we take some home). The bread is outstanding made from ancient grains.  The food has wonderful taste combinations (e.g. a side salad of cabbage and carrots had fresh ginger in it that made a big difference). How they prepare the food and the taste combinations is what really makes the food great.  They will customize things for you when they can, drinks and food, and can easily accommodate the standard food allergies.  Their hours vary, sometimes they are open in the evenings, sometimes only breakfast and lunch.  Weekend brunch is the busiest so there might be a wait and occasionally on a later evening they have been slow but brought out free tortilla chips which was nice.   They have all sorts of coffees & teas & specialty drinks (hot & cold),  and a case full of deserts, so they are also good to stop by for a coffee.  Dogs are welcome in the outside tables.  One last nice plus, they are a drop off spot for organic farmer co-op shares - sunizonafamilyfarms, where you can get a standard share or pick and choose each week what items you want to order.  We used to stop by about once a week, enough the staff got to know us.  But now we get a farm box and are there a couple times a week - just a nice side effect."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for awhile but their Ahwatukee location is too far from where I live so I was super excited to hear they opened a new location in Phoenix that is not too far from me! The food was amazing!! I had the mermaid wrap with potato salad and my non-vegan boyfriend even loved it! It was super fresh and like nothing I've had before! I also got an almond joy bar to go from the dessert counter and it totally satisfied my cravings for something sweet. We will definitely be back often, this is my new favorite vegan restaurant by far!"}
{"text":"I. Love. This. Place. I live in San Tan Valley, so this pretty far from me. About 45/50 minutes. That didn't stop me tho. The food was hot, fresh and full of flavor. It is kind of expensive but you're getting good quality food. The avocado bfast sandwich is my favorite!! The macadamia pesto has a great flavor with their seasoned tofu and the avocado just makes it blend so well. I'm craving it all over again. And the hibiscus cooler was sweet and refreshing. I would definitely drive here again, it's so worth it to me!!"}
{"text":"I recently visited this place for the first time, the drinks were great, we ordered two of their smoothies, the food was a bit cold considering we ordered hot foods. Our server was chatting it up with a customer, didn't really check on us.  We didn't receive a check, after waiting for a long time we decided to go inside to find out what was going on, our serve was talking to the same customer from outside, then she finally let us know that the credit card machine was down, we had no other choice but to wait, we waited for about 20 min before we could leave.   This is was a terrible experience, employees don't seem engaging, don't show empathy for what happened and aren't very communicating.   Overall, I give this place a 1."}
{"text":"An excellent addition to the dining corridor of 7th Street in Central Phoenix! This family owned and operated cafe has a charming casual interior as well as outdoor patio, very warm and friendly service, and flavorful and satisfying vegetarian and vegan fare made from seasonal local products. And almost everything on the menu can be made gluten-free upon request."}
{"text":"The food is amazing !!!! I loved everything about it ! One of the best vegan places out here in chandler . Our waiter Justine is such a sweetheart !"}
{"text":"Amazing. Good raw food selection and great live music on Saturday evening! They use all local and organic ingredients and have cool seasonal drinks and food."}
{"text":"POM never disappoints! We had the nachos, mushroom street tacos and happy hour cheese crisp for dinner and all three were amazing! The chili con queso on those nachos is stuff made from the heavens!  We enjoyed after dinner cappuccino and Cassie's latte, with a couple of truffles and the cookie dough brownie. Again, these sweet treats were the perfect end to a wonderful dinner!  I've had the Thanksgiving dinner and treats before but this was the first time sitting down for dinner. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"they have a great selection of salads. i find their breakfast selection to be soso, but lunch is good. their salads are portioned as an average salad portion for a \"large\". i was still hungry after downing a \"large\" salad for $14. but im just going to assume that their ingredients are a higher quality than most non vegan places so im willing to fork over the extra cash. it is serve yourself water, but the waitresses bring you the food after you order at the counter. you can also wait for a waitress to approach you but its faster and hence better to just order at the counter. they do check up on you after your food comes so that is nice. also parking is easy because it is in a strip mall next to trader joes."}
{"text":"Over priced breakfast poor service consitently. I have been here 4 times now. Vegan options are good very social employee's with each other lots of conversations  going on about everything but my meal which comes in late 3 out of 4 times.  NEVER order off menu they will make you wait as if to punish you for it. And if your a verstic expect to be referenced as \"honey or sweetie\" by some young girl who maybe all of 24 years old. I am also not  a fan of uncomfortable seating.hitting my knee on a round barrel table nearly broke my knee cap. They are very impressed with themselves and less concerned about your dining experience. Too bad."}
{"text":"Won't be returning again. Service has much to be desired with slow service just to place your order. Really felt ignored.  Second, screwing up on simple beverage order, and  not informing me that the entree I ordered is not available, and substituting another entree 180 opposite to what I would order! What ever happened to addressing the customer by saying \" We ran out of your chosen entree, could we interest you in something else?\"  But no....  Third, the price for two to have entrees and 1 appetizer was $52.00. And trust me this place is shabby and lacks comfort and decent servers. My wife and I are frequent customers of The CuttingBoard in Mesa AZ. We were told Pomegranate was the same perhaps better. We think not! The CuttingBoard rocks and service is exceptional. Save your money and humility and stay far away from Pomegranates. They are lucky I gave them 1 star."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Everything I have ever tried here is fresh, delicious, imaginative and healthy. Weekend brunch specials are always amazing.  The desserts are worth driving from north Phoenix for.  In fact, everything is worth the drive. My absolute favorite thing is the grilled cheese Napolean, lots of delish veggies, homemade bread. Yum!"}
{"text":"20 minutes for a California wrap and a lukewarm Maca Warroir Mocha with chocolate all over outside of the cup at a cost of $20. No thanks."}
{"text":"This restaurant almost killed me! As a vegan who is allergic to cashews I am very careful when I go to a vegan restaurant because I know cashews tend to be hidden in a lot of vegan creamy sauces as a cheese substitute. I asked about cashews before ordering, and I asked again when my food arrived. I was assured that the vegan ranch was sunflower based, but when I put it to my lips they ballooned up and were immediately on fire. Thank god I didn't actually put anything in my mouth or swallow a bite of food. I walked up to the kitchen and asked the waiter again, and he still said it was sunflower based, along with one of his coworkers who agreed. I asked him to ask the chef to be sure (because I knew I was already having a reaction) and he finally went to go check. Sure enough, THREE of the items I ordered had cashews. Vegan ranch in my appetizer, in the wrap I ordered, and cashews in the potato salad I ordered as my side. 1. Who puts cashews in potato salad? 2. I ASKED THREE TIMES! The server kept repeating over and over that he was on vacation for 20 days and they changed the menu around while he was gone.  Fine, but then why didn't he check with the chef the FIRST time I asked? He tried to charge us for the full meal even though I was too busy wheezing to eat. My husband refused to pay for food that I was too sick to touch and asked for the manager. The waiter took my food off of the bill but would not get the manager. So here I am posting on Yelp in the hope that someone from management will see this and realize how serious food allergies are. If you're going to hide nuts in almost every dish on your menu and not educate your staff when you change recipes then you really need to have an allergen guide on your menu so customers can help themselves. I was able to treat myself quickly for the anaphylactic reaction that this restaurant's negligence caused but the next person might not be so lucky. I might not have been so lucky if I had actually swallowed a bite. If you have food allergies do not go to this restaurant because they do not take it seriously."}
{"text":"This is a great \"health nut\" restaurant. The food is high-quality and tasty. They have a couple of raw entrees on their menu as well as vegetarian dishes. The place is busy, so their food is always fresh due to the quick turn-over of food. The  food is high-quality, so I would say the prices are fair. Anyone who shops at Whole Foods can appreciate the cost that went into this food."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. People complain about the price, but they make almost everything in house, many of what you're eating is sourced locally which is very important to me, and it's all organic and non gmo. Which in the real world, are very expensive things in which they need to offset the cost. My favorite ever was the buffalo mac and cheese, among all the dessert goodies. Service is always an issue here I know, but the food makes it worth it. I am a regular customer and it's nice to stop by from time to time and enjoy a nice meal. The happy hour menu is kick ass."}
{"text":"Fun and funky that you almost forget you are in a strip mall. For those with dietary restrictions you have great choices that are healthy and flavorful.  Everything we have tried thus far has been delicious."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. If it wasn't for the food, this would be 2 stars. I love eating here, but they have slowest service on the planet. It isn't just one waiter or waitress, it's all of them every time. I keep coming back because the food is fantastic. One time my boyfriend and I waited an hour for our food. I don't know if it's a lack of training or what, but please please please do something to make your service more efficient."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you're aiming to eat healthy! This cafe offers raw, organic, gluten free options too. Their ingredients are extremely fresh and their dishes are beautifully plated for a casual cafe.   We tried the pesto presto sandwich, which consisted of avocado, sunflower sprouts, tomato slices and pesto on a whole wheat baguette. They give such a generous amount of avocado it is SO good, and the pesto flavor is perfect and not too over-powering. The tortilla soup was the best I've tried yet. We also had the BLT on whole wheat toast. They use tempeh bacon and it was delish!  We also tried the \"donut holes\" - if you check-in on foursquare (1st time only) you get a free donut hole.  Well, they were definitely not the donut hole I was expecting - basically a ball of organic raw type ingredients...of what I'm not sure but the two flavors they had resembled the taste of a Lara Bar - just in a ball. :)  Only downside is that it is a little pricier for their sandwiches/ lunch. But definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is great but the service is terrible!  Even when it was apparent we were looking for our server, no one came by. The server would finally come to our area, and take the order at the table next to us but didn't bother to check in with us. She ignored the hand gesture and the verbal request. We have been here 5+ times and the service has been terrible each time. But ... there are few vegan options with good tasting food so we come back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I am about 95% raw vegan and this place is so delicious. LOVE raw Friday. The desserts are to die for and well... I have not tried anything that was not Fa-Boo!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Vegan food done right. I absolutely loved their raw tacos and Greek goddess pizza. We shared a large cobb salad (which was huge!) and we still took some home! Very healthy and yummy. I had some room for desert and coffee (coconut milk/oil fans celebrate!!) and it was just to die for! Their brownie cake is the ultimate cheat day delight"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! I really like the vegan cheese quesadilla and the Mac and Cheese.. my friend who isn't vegan likes it here as well! Will be coming back Sunday, I just can't get enough of this place! So very good!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this joint for over two years and I finally took the plunge to drive 30 minutes for lunch here. Walking up I was told to wait to be seated. It took another 10 minutes to have someone come over and give me water. The part that bothered me the most was the girls were behind the counter complaining how slow it was. They waited another 10 minutes before the waitress actually came over to me. At this time I ordered a $4 nitro cold brew coffee. I attempted to order my lunch at the same time but she walked away mid-sentence.  The coffee was 3 star taste, but I think it would have been better had it been colder. Perhaps I should have asked for ice, but it's odd to have nitro on ice.   When she came back I ordered the $13 buffalo \"chicken\" wrap. It came out rather quickly. Their fake chicken is spot-on! I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately it didn't taste anything like buffalo but rather bbq. It was even the color of bbq - maybe I was given the wrong one. Had they had a vegan cayenne-based hot sauce it would have been a lot better. I make vegan wing sauce at home all of the time, It's very easy.   I ended up eating it like a salad because the burrito fell apart. I dumped the contents out, drizzled the ranch, and embraced it as a salad. Their sunflower seed ranch is the bomb! I'm very impressed with how much it tastes like ranch despite being vegan.   I've read other reviews and it seems like the trick around the slow service is to order at the bar and then sit down.  I really hope they open up a Scottsdale or Phoenix location as long as they improve upon their service."}
{"text":"Ok so this place is the definition of \"my cup of tea\" for me. My friend had mentioned it to me and said I would love it and with her love for food maybe being as much as mine I trusted her and she has yet to disappoint.   I called in for pick up and the woman on the phone was so nice and delightful. She said that the wait was only going to be about 10 to 15 minutes which I was very surprised about being a Sunday morning and a holiday weekend. So I ordered the wild western tacos and an abundance juice. the total came out to be $27 which at the time I thought was rather high. When I went to pick up my food the guy at the counter was very friendly and I just instantly fell in love with the atmosphere and environment of the place.   I tried my juice in the car on the way home and honestly it was just okay. For $9 I was expecting a little bit more. The tacos however were AMAZING and such a huge portion which I love so I can save for later.   Five stars. You guys rock."}
{"text":"im so happy there is a closer location to me, so I can come more often! that being said..ill probably wait another year for this one to become more established. The service wasn't as good as the first one. You can tell they are literally training all new people it seems like. Which isn't bad..but I'd rather spend the same amount of money, for better food, and service..I really was just not happy about spending more than 14 bucks for a burrito I could have made better at home..lol but over all my favorite restaurants in az! I know they are trying so I will come back later(:"}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant I can go to and be completely happy, and satisfied being at no matter what! out of all vegan restaurants I've been to in Arizona, this IS the best. no competition what so ever. I would go here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. the food is so delicious, and REAL, you can TASTE the difference. they are using real organic food...thank you for that.      they also have one of the best staffs I've ever seen at a restaurant. the people are never rude, and thats all I care about. it is kinda expensive, but you pay for what you get! and that is QUALITY! which I don't mind paying when the food is fresh, delicious, and worth my money!! I believe more restaurants should look at this one, as an example of how they should be...it really is that great."}
{"text":"Tastey, healthy and fullfilling. Love to eat here and so glad there are other options besides fast food."}
{"text":"Definitely a place for vegetarians. If you're a guy that likes pasta hamburgers wings lasagna etc then this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Pom has wonderful food and the atmosphere is nice however today was not as positive as my previous visit (7th Street location). We were greeted on entering and seated after a couple minutes then waitress \"Natalie\" asked if we had any questions about the menu and took our order. After about 20 minutes, I asked Natalie if we could have our drinks and her response was \"I'm at the mercy of....we are short staffed\". After another couple minutes, she did bring our drinks. We continued to wait with no additional interaction with the waitress although another lady came by to ask if we were still waiting on food and she would check on it. No word from her or the waitress even though Natalie did walk by several times. On taking in the activity, we noticed the kitchen prepared dishes piling up on the counter. It appeared to be so many that they were running out of room to place the finished dishes. Granted, they were busy however prepared food just sitting on the counter was concerning. At close to 45 minutes with no word and no meal, we were increasingly frustrated and while not their concern, I had taken a couple units of insulin prior to entering the restaurant in anticipation of being able to eat. At 45 minutes though, with mounting frustration and being alerted to dropping blood sugar, we decided to leave. Needless to say, it was immensely disappointing and very frustrating. Appearances can be deceiving so with the crowd attending the restaurant and lack of service, we can only assume this was either mismanagement of the restaurant, kitchen, and staff plus there not being enough staff or this was just a difficult day for them."}
{"text":"Great vegan options, but be prepared to wait 45 minutes  to get your food after ordering"}
{"text":"What's the big deal. Food tasted mediocre and over-priced. I had a some egg-like dish. Place looked nice with outdoor seating and colorful inside, that's why I tried it. But expansion seems over-zealous. Waste of money. Try \"Green\", it's super tasty."}
{"text":"Who knew eating healthy could taste so good. My wife absolutely loves this place and has gotten so much inspiration for our habits at home from this place. For me it's 5 stars for the food and atmosphere.  Only downside is its not cheap. You'll shell out to eat here. I do suggest their smoothies, excellent."}
{"text":"Pomegranate's quality is second to none. I enjoy the lumberjack for breakfast and the bountiful bowl for lunches and dinner. Have also tried their pancakes which are amazing. There is always great ambiance with pleasant music playing, self aware and health conscious people inhabiting, and fascinating employees. My only complaint is the price. Most of the types of juices made here are offered elsewhere a little cheaper. But the quality is truly their greatest value and for that, I will continue to come back here every time I swing by good ole Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"My vegan friend and I went here last night.. it was so so fabulous! We ordered the nachos, side of potato salad,  Mac and cheese and tacos.. of course it was totally vegan, with perfect raw ingredients as well, and absolutely delicious! ( I'm eating the cold leftovers now!) The staff is very friendly and helpful, happy and smiling!  As being veggie since 1997, and vegan since 2008, I will say that this restaurant will rival any that you'll find in Los Angeles, and I cannot wait to go back! Pomegranate Cafe will be a permanent home for me!!"}
{"text":"Love the nachos here the walnut meat is super yummy. They also have great coffees juices and desserts. I like the snickers bar!!they are all vegan too! So no dairy. Yay! Can't wait for our next visit."}
{"text":"I love local/whole food cafes with focus on bringing good quality foods! I was asked to try Pomegranate Cafe with friend whom frequents this place on regular. We came in after hour long hike on South Mountain with rumbling tummies for some good food! We were greeted and sat immediately with menus and cucumber waters. I was in awe of the trendy decor with mason jar as light fixtures and community style seating.   Reviewing the menu, you understand Pomegranate Cafe has a passion for bring locally sourced foods with bust of flavor in Vegetarian style. I was amazed all the different selections of salads, wraps, sharables, burritos/bowls and drinks to chose from. I chose the nachos and my friend chose a burrito. My nachos came with \"meat\" plant based meat that brought it whole another level. It tasted really good. My friend enjoyed her burrito as well. She mentions that we should come back for breakfast as they have good menu. I took note of the brunch hours for weekend, 8-4pm with special items as noted on wall.   Pomegranate Cafe does also have market attached for locally sourced items if you need to grab anything before leaving. You have come experience this gem."}
{"text":"Finally a raw food cafe that isn't in Tempe.  Love their drinks and raw food menu.  Just wish their prices would come down bit.      This is the type of place I could eat at everyday.  I know it is good because the afternoon lull doesn't happen to me when I eat here.      I do NOT go daily, due to pricing, but I would like too, because I would simply live longer eating here.  Your body buzzes with clean energy (non-caffeine) after eating here.    If you are a person who wants to be nice to your body.  Splurge and give your body what it craves....Enzymes.      Who knew raw food was the answer to avoiding afternoon coffee.......?"}
{"text":"OMG!  For once I feel at home with restaurant food.  As a vegetarian for almost 30 years, and now going vegan, This place is the bomb! (Excuse my dated expressions.)  I had the falafel salad and it was sooo good. The waiter asked me if I wanted a take home bag after I had eaten half of it, (It was a huge salad.) but I told him no, that I would eat it all. And that I did.  I consumed this huge salad and enjoyed every last bit.  The prices are pretty good, but I\"m cheap, so anything over $5 is a little high for me. (Which is absurd, I really need to work on that mindset!)  I also had some sort of juice.  I can't remember what I got I just remember it being like the drink of the gods.    As far as atmosphere, well, to be honest I thought I was back in the late '60's early 70's.  (Yep, I'm that old!!! But please don't tell anyone.)  Even though I'm an old hippie, it's hard for me to see young ones...now....in 2015.  Anyway, God bless 'em, right? The only thing I wish, I wish they were open at night and had alcoholic beverages.   I loved this place.  The food is marvelous....check it out!!!"}
{"text":"It should be said that Cassie and Marlene Tolman have done an important thing for the valley food scene.  Restaurants focused on organic, healthy, and environmentally conscious products are relatively easy to find in various urban parts of the valley.  The suburbs on the other hand are typically a parade of chains dishing out high volumes of product that often only pay lip service to those who seek out sustainably produced and harvested foods.  By locating their fledgling business in Ahwatukee, the Tolmans have taken a gamble on spreading that business model to very edge of the valley.  A gamble that has clearly paid off.  Pomegranate is a fairly lengthy drive from my apartment, but I've really enjoyed sampling some of their foods at various food festivals here in the valley (the PHX Vegan Festival being the most recent).  Looking to get the full experience of Pomegranate, I made my way here for breakfast on Saturday morning.  On the southeast corner of 40th Street & Chandler in the Safeway shopping complex, you'll find Pomegranate by virtue of their fenced in outdoor patio lined with tall wooden tables and umbrellas.  Inside the restaurant is a beautiful array of color (pink being the most dominant among them) with the the sit down restaurant on the left and a small market on the right selling a variety of food and non-food products.  I came at the opening expecting a busy Easter weekend crowd (which sure enough filled the place within an hour).  I grabbed a table in the corner to take it all in.  The menu as noted earlier is focused heavily on organic and sustainable products.  No GMO products allowed and the bulk of the food is vegan (with some vegetarian alternatives available).  They source locally, compost their leftovers, and much of the menu changes with what's available in season.  The first menu item that caught my attention was the Chimpanzee Bowl.  Granola, banana, seasonal fruit (in this case, strawberries), and what they call a \"superfood mix\" (I picked up on a variety of nuts as well as some coconut and dried berries).  Douse it with their \"Po\" Milk (essentially milk made from various nuts and seeds) and you've got a giant bowl of granola, nut & fruit cereal.  I loved this.  Clean fresh flavors with a balanced sweetness from the fresh fruit (including the dried berries).  Footnote: The cafe donates $1 to the Jane Goodall Institute (a global wildlife and environmental conservation organization) for every Chimpanzee Bowl ordered.    I also ordered something they only sell during weekend breakfast hours.  One of their giant cinnamon rolls.  Came out to me fresh out of the oven.  This isn't the biggest cinnamon roll I've ever seen (The Machine Shed in Iowa still holds that title), but its pretty large (I'd guess 4\"W x 4\"L x 2\"H).  The cinnamon roll was okay, but didn't knock my socks off.  I was expecting a smoother texture coming straight from the oven, but it was a little nutty and grainier than I wanted.  I prefer cinnamon rolls where the breading and frosting do most of the talking, but that's just me.  Lastly, to wash it all down, I got one of their juice drinks called The Rainbow.  A mixture of beets, apple, kale, ginger, orange, carrot, and cucumber juices.  As intriguing as it sounded, the flavor was absolutely not my thing.  I guess I was expecting the fruits and the cucumber to be a little more dominant but all I could really make out were the beets.  If you love beet juice you'd probably love this drink.  I only got about halfway through mine before I just couldn't handle it anymore.  Total price for the food, drink, tax, and tip came to about $35.  Having dined at plenty of vegan and vegetarian establishments in my time, I'm fully aware that restaurants focused on sustainability can (and often do) mean paying a premium.  Still, for many Pomegranate Cafe likely wouldn't be an affordable every day (or even every week) option.  Based on the response they've received from the Ahwatukee community it seems as though plenty are willing to make the journey here, which I'm glad about.  As more restaurants look to innovate using a sustainable model similar to what the Tolmans are using, perhaps the price point will be such that places like Pomegranate can reach a larger audience.  From my own experience, Pomegranate is great in spots, not so great in others, but completely committed to their model of sustainability.  I would come back for a quick bite for breakfast or lunch if I were in the neighborhood, but probably on a special occasion basis only."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has amazing food!  It is so refreshing to see vegetarian food with variety, flavor and creativity.   I wanted to eat every single thing on the menu, and so did my friend.  We decided to start off with the hummus of the day (Butternut squash), and split two meals, the vegan tacos and the burger of the day (Sweet potato and Mill).  The tacos were filled with a spiced walnut \"meat\" vegan nacho cheese and sour cream and served in red cabbage cups.  They were soooo good, I would have never thought to use walnuts as meat substitute, brilliant! The burger was another big winner! It had a jalapeño curry sauce that was so flavorful, and it paired nicely with the sweet potato and avocado. On the side were yummy baked fries with homemade barbeque sauce... still licking my lips!  I'll definitely be back, again, and again, and AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Oh, that burger was so so so so good!  I was worried about the mixed reviews at the new location, but I took a chance.   I was quickly seated, the service was great, and the food was wonderful.  I got the burger with root vegetable fries and it was amazing.  As an added bonus the manager even offered to replace my fries at any time because he thought they might be a bit too done, but I thought they were perfect.      Everything about the restaurant was perfect.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"3.5 --Decided to try this place based on reviews. Was thinking it would be busy but when I walked in not too many people. I went to counter said it was my first visit gave me a menu. Lots of items on the menu. Opted for seasonal omelet, egg whites, cheese, hash, toast. They do offer vegan choices(vegan cheese, tofu). It took a bit to receive my coffee (served gentleman behind me first) and my meal. The plate was plentiful and very fresh. The hash were a potatoes, squash with rosemary. Different but good. The omelet was also fresh but not quite enough cheese. The veggies were squash, carrots (orange, yellow, purple). All in all, I would give this place another shot. Love the freshness...My meal was $14"}
{"text":"Pomegranate Cafe is my favorite vegetarian restaurant! The food and the service is always top notch."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with friends. I highly. Recommend them. The food is freshly prepared in ample quantities. The delightful combination of herbs and spices enhances the modest of dishes to new experiences. The menu all around is good."}
{"text":"They have some of the best vegan and gluten free desserts I have ever had! My wife and I have stopped in to pick up dessert about 10 times since they opened. Am I embarrassed about that? A little. But, eventually we will get around to trying the food. So glad they are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We are not vegetarian, but heard good things and it's right in our neighborhood, so wanted to check it out. I tried the lemon poppy seed pancakes with strawberry compote and they were very good! My husband had the dragon 'burger' and he really enjoyed that as well with a side of hummus and veggies. The juices and smoothies seem interesting, but I'm not sure if I'm brave enough to try them...We liked the atmosphere and we will return to try more new things here!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty inconsistent but the desserts are great. They are very slow, understaffed and not so willing to customize orders. The service is an issue with some servers being nice and some not so much especially when you only order off of happy hour menu. Not too willing to come back! It used to be 4 stars but went down to 2."}
{"text":"From the passionate vegan,  or the foodie wanting to try something new, or even someone just wanting a healthy meal this place has something for everyone! Even the hardcore carnivores come here and don't miss the meat ;) I have been going to the Chandler location any chance I get and the vibe and atmosphere is infectious with good vibes! Cassie, the owner is such a delight! She is always open to listening to any tips or menu items that were a special that you want on the menu permanent. I HIGHLY recommend the blueberry lavender smoothie! It has a hint of house made lavender syrup and it always a good one on a hot Arizona day! The Green Bandido bowl is also amazing! Their weekend brunch specials are delicious! The green juices have no ice so you're getting your monies worth!   If you plan on heading there on a weekend be prepared for it to be busy! If you're in a rush on the weekend this is not a place to go. Good quality food takes time and it requires some patience as the hard working staff do their best to get the food to you fresh! Come in enjoy the company you keep and fill up on healthy eats! You definitely won't leave being hungry and there is something on the menu for everyone's taste buds! They can also accommodate food allergies for almost anything! Love love love the Pom!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple times to get juice that is fresh-squeezed. It's kind of a place for New Age earthy crunchy people. The fresh squeezed juice is good but way overpriced. I just make my juice at home in my juicer. At almost $10 a pop for a glass of fresh squeezed juice, I will go without it."}
{"text":"very good food, and healthy. Nice staff. The atmosphere is very cute and nice. The ONLY thing is that it takes forever to order and they only have one person on the register to take customers, this can easily be remedied by having 2 registers, but since there's only one, it takes 15-20 to order when it's busy (which is usually the only time I can go)."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Great service, lovely atmosphere, and lots of good vegan options. The nachos were very satisfying and the curry bowl was nice. Had a nice cocktail too, now that they have their liquor license. Portion sizes are huge! Plenty of seating, inside and out. Parking is easy in the big lot."}
{"text":"I like this place because it's one of the only places around here to get a coconut milk latte.  They also have AMAZING gluten-free and dairy-free treats, and kombucha. Win, win, win.  AND it's right next to Trader Joe's...win!  However, their hours keep changing, so I never know how late they will be open.  Also, it is very confusing as to whether you seat yourself and someone will take your order, or if you go order and then sit down.  Last time I was there, I saw people doing it both ways. I had ordered and then sat down, and the servers ignored me, but seemed to wait on everyone around me.  It's also expensive and usually crazy busy.  But I continue to come here for the coffee and raw/gluten-free treats, and fun health-foody finds like maca powder and mason jar glasses!"}
{"text":"OBSESSED. Can't get enough.  The desserts. The food. The coffee. The love for community.   My only complaint is the cafe isn't anywhere remotely convenient for us but that's not their fault. Given the 8pm closing time, the hours are a little less-than-convenient but again, if we lived closer this probably wouldn't pose a problem. Please open a location closer to Central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The entrees are amazing and so are the deserts and drinks.  Have been going to them since they opened.  It is one of my favorite hang outs to lunch with friends or myself.  I enjoy doing work on my laptop at their atmosphere."}
{"text":"A truly excellent place!  The food is great & the staff is amazing.  I don't love everything on the menu, but love many more items to make this place a 5-star rating.  If you get lucky you may get to have the raw lasagna that is a special only... it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Very interesting place. I got the magic coffee which was tasty . To me it's like whole foods made a restaurant. It's very nice and I will be back to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  In an area full of restaurants serving either A) Stuff that's just plain bad for you, or B) Stuff that's mediocre, or both, Pomegranate stands out. Every dish is yummy AND it's good for your bod! Love this place. My only complaint is that service can be un-even. Mostly it's fine, but on busy days the staff can get a bit overwhelmed, it seems to me, so they get a little stressed and you have to be patient with them."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment when I was on vacation. I wish I lived closer so I could eat here more often! My daughter LOVED it too!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, lattes and atmosphere. I visited this location when they first opened and wasn't impressed. Obviously their were some issues with training and quality workers with great customer service or lack of leadership. I love the Awatukhee location. Today's visit was wonderful. I was greeted with a smile and was sat immediately. My server was also very polite and answered all my questions. I ended up ordering the veggie burger with fries. I also ordered a vanilla latte with there Pom milk. Omg, soooo gooood! They make the syrup in house and use organic coffee beans. I'm happy I keep coming back because service has improved and food is always mind blowing. This place is for those who are either cutting meat out of there diet or cutting back on meat consumption. Those who want to eat organic, locally sourced delicious food. Everyone should at least try it. It's a great place to start eating fresh vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic. I ordered an iced coconut hazelnut latte which is obviously organic and had a milk alternative, and the bandito burrito. This is hands down the best burrito I've ever eaten. Everyone here is extremely friendly and they have a nice outdoor seating area. I wish I lived here so I could become a regular at this place! 5+ stars for this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great vegan food and desserts. It is a bit of a drive for me, but it's worth it. The people are friendly and service is great. I love supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"I met a coworker here last week knowing that she tries to eat vegan/vegetarian.  The restaurant is very cute, service is good and the Sambazon Sunset smoothie was beautiful and so delicious!  I wish I could drink one every day...it was that good!"}
{"text":"Healthy, happy, ethical eating with a cute atmosphere! Meals are affordable and generous portions. The drinks and desserts are slightly pricey but well worth it. The staff actually holds conversations with you. While it can get loud from high powered blenders, seating in the back or outside is enjoyable. Food will come to you very quickly! Don't go at peak times like the low-star reviewers probably are (give them a break, food service is hectic when you're a full house!). I'm definitely going to be ordering future birthday cakes from Pom! PS- Try the Spicy Buffalo Chikn Wrap, Arizona Rolls, or chocolate cake! YUM."}
{"text":"Just tried to eat lunch here (1PM on a Thursday). Waited five minutes to be seated (plenty of tables open). Waited another ten minutes with zero staff interaction and decided to leave. Service is just terrible. Which is too bad, the menu looked good and interesting."}
{"text":"Place is a little expensive but it was kinda good. Customer service is pretty cool and I enjoy the organic vibe."}
{"text":"I stood up at the front for probably about 10 min and finally the male server helped me out.  I sat at the table probably for about another 8 minutes (I got bored so yeah I timed it) before I was greeted, the girl gave me a water, \"how are you?\" Then ran off. Did not give me any option to order at that time or ask me what I actually wanted to drink.  About 15 minutes later she came back to take my order, never asked me what I actually wanted to drink.  I came to this place because I called that morning to ask them if they had vegan pancakes and the girl on the phone told me every day until 12... then my server told me oh that's actually on the weekends. Cool, so I drove 30 minutes out here for poor service with out pancakes lol   I know you were understaffed the day after Christmas. There were two servers handling the entire restaurant but as a bartender I know the difference between slow and good service and slow and poor service. Very poor service. No one asked my how my food was, I had to get up and refill my own water glass and I had to stare down my waitress with my card in my hand just so I could pay.   I wouldn't be opposed to trying this place again but unfortunately I had a terrible first experience.  The concept and decor seemed very appealing."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place.  The food is consistently amazing, high quality and fabulous tasting.  The owners genuinely CARE about the food, their staff, the clients and it shows.  Thank you for being my favorite cafe.  Keep up the awesome work."}
{"text":"Really cute restaurant fun upbeat place.  My problem was the service, I waited 40 minutes for my food and the people who ordered after me had already been served their food.  Finally I just left and a waitress, not mine ran after me in the parking lot demanding I pay for my food.  I just turned around and said, I was never served my food, and I'm not going to pay for my water.  She looked at me confused and tried to say but your food, and I just walked on.  Unfortunately this was my first trip and I never got to taste the food.  Big fail on the restaurant."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit to Pomegranate Cafe. I ordered the blueberry French toast and it was delicious and filling! Service was very prompt and pleasant! I will be back!"}
{"text":"So delicious. My veggie wrap was packed with fresh, crunchy veggies with a slightly sweet sauce. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Quaint environment and great for vegans and vegetarians. Prices are steep but quality is good too. I ordered a breakfast plate from their board (no price listed) and a pomegranate tea - was surprised at a $22 bill.   Now, I'm not vegetarian so my perspective comes from a \"likes to be healthy\" meat eater. Eggs were good. Veggie bacon wasn't for me because I really like the real stuff but I think vegetarians would love it. Pancake special was tasty with fruit, sprinkle of chocolate  and nuts in it. Pomegranate tea was only okay and apparently cost $4-$5. Service was minor - very little interaction with those of us sitting at the bar. Decor was cute.   Overall - I'm glad it's here for all my vegan/vegetarian friends but would only come back with them. The price was just too high for my simple breakfast needs."}
{"text":"I live very close to Pomegranate Cafe and I'm surprised I haven't stumbled across this gem sooner! I love the nature and ambience of the café, it's very low key and everyone that works here seems so happy and so proud of this place. I got this super power smoothie with added protein and it tastes phenomenal. The place looks Beautiful with a lot of great artwork and unique furniture. Overall I would give this place a 10 out of 10. This is going to be my new spot for organic food and a positive atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Please open a location downtown!!! I'm never in this area but have wanted to try this place. It's on point! the chai latte is wonderful. Just enough spice and sweet and smooth with their homemade but milk. Salad was soooo good. And the soup: eggplant chowder. Flavorful and delicious. Love it!"}
{"text":"I just had the best experience at Pomegranate Cafe! This was my first time and the cashier and the owner went over the menu with me and provided suggestions on what to get. It was a hard decision because everything sounds amazing. I finally settled on the Athena Bowl which has tabouli, hummus, pesto on a bed of kale. The flavor was amazing and the pita bread was great for the hummus and pesto. I must also say that the restaurant is so adorable! They have the cutest tables with great center pieces. I noticed on the way out that they have herb boxes out front amongst the outdoor seating. The desert case is to die for and I gave into temptation and left with a slice of carrot cake AND a brownie. I know, I was really bad! The thing that impressed me the most about this place (besides the vegan food) is that they are so nice! Everyone there was so social and made me feel right at home. I really hope that they open up additional locations and put one in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger, that really hit the spot! I had a great server that loved my hat \"vegan vibes\" (you can use the code SYDNEY15 for 15% off!)   Recently moved to downtown phx, but I will be making trips back to my old neighborhood to hit up this spot."}
{"text":"Amazing food and customer service. I ordered the summer breeze juice which was refreshing and the smokin blt. So good. Tasted better than actual bacon. I'll be back again. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hi everybody!  This is a tough review for me because I shop at trader joes almost exclusively and my wife and I watched and waited for this restaurant to open. Granted it has been open for awhile it took us some time to get to it. I am not really sure it was open many times as we passed and were hungry. Finally we checked the menu and CHACHING!  So we moved it to the top of the list for trying and we were excited to come. As we only eat out on shopping day. Maybe too much. As usual whenever we eat at any restaurant we asked our \"vegan\" questions. We were told that someone there was a vegan nazi and if it says vegan it is, and this is very good.   I will say that i do trust that Pomegranate Cafe serves what they say they serve and the food was very high quality and very delicious. We shared the lentil burger ($12) that was on the menu board behind the counter. I really wanted to try the desserts but decided to wait till next time.  Everything was going great and we waited patiently for our food. Granted it was busy so it took a little time and this also is ok.   Here is where my problems begin. Bellieve me I do not want to give ANY business ANY time only 2 stars.  Trust me i just don't and i feel bad for doing so however, I did say on my profile that the reviews i do are very important to me. I am the kind of person who does not mince words and you will know where you stand with me. If i see something i do not like i will say so.    That being said  Now I will say that I have worked in the restaurant industry since i was 16. I have done every side job known to everyone who has set foot into a kitchen. (explained later) I have helped build business for many. Though I do not have any degrees or anything I have seen many meals being sent to customers in many differents ways, and styles. Some were good, some were bad, some were happy, some were mad. But they all ate and they either came back or they didn't. Currently I work in not one but two very popular digs. I work very hard to make sure my customers are happy, and i know how hard it is to work in a small family place. I worked at a local chinese restaurant for 6 years and barely got  a day off.  Do not get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the food here. my issue is with one small thing or two.   Why does a new business in the realm of Pomegranate (a higher class cafe which serves vegan food) charge a plate splitting fee which i believe was $2.00. Then give us our food on a paper plate. Please, this is ridiculous. We always split our food no matter where we go. It is pratically the only way you can stay healthy these days. Not to mention we believe that there was no more food for this charge. (for example: if there were more chips or pickles or fruit, then i do not have a problem with this fee. however I would say when asked to split. \" OK, no problem, however there will be a $?.?? charge, and for that you will recieve ....) if i would have known this i would have gotten it to go and this review would be totally different. And in my humble opinion it is not a good idea to charge this fee in an uber difficult restaurant \"genre\".    Believe me there are lots of people like me who want food like this. Do not make it harder on yourself by adding on fees which really are not necessary! Are you not making enough money off of $0.25 worth of lentils?  I also have to say that I had trouble choosing something to eat from the menu, because many things were scratched off. ???? Were they out of that item? I think the thing that bothered me about this was there were so many that i wanted to try but could not. I saw many that had promise, as I am a vegan nazi and i really was stoked to eat here. It is my kind of place almost to a t. Too bad that did not work out.  Now for the side job part.   While we waited for our food i noticed that this restaurants dining room was not very clean. the floor looked as if it had not been cleaned for a few days, the windows were very dirty, and the window sills were covered, and i mean covered in dust. Complete with cobwebs. From what i could tell the kitchen was clean.   Here is how I see it. Please do not serve a $14.50 burger on a paper plate EVER! To me this says that the staff does not want to do dishes, If something is on your menu keep it there, when people find something they like they will come back no matter how much it costs if they know it will be there. Clean your dining room! it is uber, uber ,uber important that your customers see a clean dining room. it does not take that long and it will go very far impressing your customers, especially when you are first getting started. When a restaurant does not take the time to clean thier dining room they most likely are not cleaning thier kitchen as well. I hope this is not the case with Pomegranate because I really would like to try more food here. I only will know by stopping by again.   Thank for reading.   Late, Greg"}
{"text":"The food is good! But that's it!  Worst services I have had. Been there 3 times and every time my \"server\" if you even want to call them that didn't do anything but take my order. Today I went and waited 20 mins to have my order taken. Then another 25 just to get my drink. It was an hour from the time we got there to when we got our food. Very slow and our server only check on us once. Asking if I got my drink. Isn't here job as our server to bring our drinks and food out. I understand it can get busy but it wasn't. I watched drinks sit at the window for well over 10 minutes. And food sat at the window for 5 minutes before the cook yelled at them to take it out. The last 45 minutes of us being there and eating our server didn't once and ask how how we were doing. I watched her do side work and roll silverware. Someone else cleared our plates and brought was our check, then another gal checked us out. Very disappointing. They did comp my drink and the food is good but when you have bad service 3 times in a row. It doesn't matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"The food here is always outstanding and I love the creativity and diversity of their menu. This is the go to place for healthy meals and/or delightful vegan, vegetarian and raw food dishes. They also have a wonderful selection of juices, smoothies, coffees and teas. I've always had great service here. Overall, it is nice to see a locally based business growing and thriving in the \"Tuke\"."}
{"text":"I just dined here and am writing this as I am leaving the restaurant. We were really excited about trying this restaurant because we're vegan and really enjoy trying out new places. We heard great things about pomegranate cafe and so we made the drive out here. We got two coffees, a hummus side, the green goddess, and the green bandito as a bowl. My entree was the green goddess and it literally tasted like nothing while the potatoes were very very cold. My friends food literally tasted like a baby ate Mexican food and then threw it up onto a plate and that's how it was presented to us along with taste. Her food was mild on spice but had absolutely no flavor. I had to ask for salt and pepper for my food, but even then was only able to force down half of my burger because I covered in so much hummus for it to actually taste like anything. My friend ate maybe two bites of her food when I left over half of my food on my plate still hence our plates still had almost all of our food on it.The server was a Indian girl who asked us if we wanted boxes for the rest of our food and I said no because we didn't like it. She did nothing to try and make it better or right, and didn't offer to have it remade or anything. I paid $45.07 for food that I literally wasn't able to eat.   The reason why I'm posting this review however is just to warn others. Go to Pita Jungle or Green to eat vegan, the food actually has flavor and is a lot better priced. The servers will actually take care of you and the experience will be better."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been hearing about Pomegranate Cafe for the last year, but really never had the chance to try it. Okay - I shouldn't lie, I think we were hesitant because it is a vegetarian restaurant, and we love our meet.  But we were intrigued because of the gluten free options (something that is critical to my husbands health).  Now I am super sad that we waited so long.  We have been missing one of the best restaurants in the Valley.  Both my husband and I had sandwiches for lunch last weekend.  I have never had such distinct flavors in a sandwich before.  It was beyond delicious!!  Maybe getting rid of the meet is critical to really letting my taste buds do their work!!  After lunch my husband and I split their gluten free Tiramisu, and it was HEAVENLY!!!!!!    The staff was super friendly, the service was quick, and the place is very cute and clean.  We will be back very soon (most likely this weekend)!!  I can't wait to share it with all of my friends!!   YUM!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate at Pomegranate last night.  Food was ok, but took forever.  Restaurant was not that busy!   We were told by waiter that there were lots of takeout orders (there weren't.)  we were also told by cashier that evenings were not busy during the week and service would be better.  We should have left and found another restaurant."}
{"text":"Local. Organic. Raw. Vegan. Gluten Free. Fresh and Tasty. Coffee/Toddy. Raw Deserts"}
{"text":"Prices had increased a little, from when they first opened.  But the shakes and juice mixes are really fresh and tasty.  The guy behind the counter, the manager I think would make interesting concoctions, they made something called morning dew one afternoon, with like mint leaves and some other ingredients that was left to bake in the sun.  I had a slice of their really nice pomegranate chocolate cake and it made my day :)  Its next to Trader's Joe and is near the Ahwatukee area, so it attracts a nice variety of people, ranging from young sporty types, to family spillover from shopping from trader joe's, to groups of friends catching up.  I don't know how good the food is, but most of the people who came seem to like it.  I think if you are looking for a nice play to chill and have a cold refreshing juice or shake and catch up, this would be a nice place to go."}
{"text":"40 MINS WAIT!!! Dont go here during peak hours. You have to ask for the same thing 10 times. The waitress kept forgetting to bring creamer for the coffee. An expensive place too !"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place but be warned it is crazy expensive.  My sister had a $14 hot tea and I had a $9 fresh powerade type drink.  Both not very big for what you get.  It was yummy but you have to be in the mood to splurge.  Kids did not like the french toast which is much more like banana bread served with syrup.  They also weren't thrilled with the mac and cheese which is white and quite bland.  I absolutely loved my tacos with tofu and guacamole and roasted vegetables.  I will for sure order it again.  We had 2 adults and 3 kids for breakfast.  The total with tip was over $100.  Ambiance is fun and service was wonderful and friendly."}
{"text":"Pomegranate Cafe deserves 6 out of 5 stars. I'm not a vegan, but the food here is incredible. The cakes and other desserts are also worth getting."}
{"text":"Meh....this place went through some major renovations. And while I appreciate it being a healthy option, I think it's sort of ridiculous for the prices. Parking is always hell on the weekends so beware!"}
{"text":"Best vegan option in the valley!  Love that I can go out to eat and still be healthy.  I almost always order one of the specials... love the variety!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Pomegranate Cafe-- there are so few family-owned and family-run restaurants in Ahwatukee, and I can't even think of another exclusively vegetarian/vegan restaurant in the area. However, I'm not going to sugarcoat this at all: the atmosphere and the service are severely lacking, and the food is overpriced. For starters, there are not nearly enough tables, and for some reason, whoever designed the place chose to use a bunch of six seater tables instead of the standard four, so you end up with two or three people at a giant table and a waste of space. The space feels small, cramped, and stressful, especially during lunchtime hours. Furthermore, I was standing in a HUGE line of people waiting to order my lunch, and instead of helping expedite the process, one of the owners was standing around chatting it up with a group of women. I then got to wait 30 or 35 minutes for my food. The food was okay, but I have definitely had better-- I had a Philly Melt, and it was $10.50 or something like that. It wasn't worth the price or the wait. If you want good vegetarian/vegan food and don't want to spend this much or deal with the cramped atmosphere, go to Green. If you don't mind spending this much and want a way better atmosphere, go to True Food. I don't think I will be visiting Pomegranate Cafe again."}
{"text":"Added teary beans to the breakfast tacos. Excellent. Next time I would even order them without eggs."}
{"text":"Love this place, great vegan food with so many flavors. Happy hour menu is on point with food and drinks as well. Going to be here more often thanks for the great service and good! Love the way this place is coming along!"}
{"text":"The only sad thing about Pomegranate is that I have to drive here from San Diego to enjoy their gastronomic delights!  Keep up your amazing work..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love the fresh, healthy food - thought it was delicious. And I have to say, I like all kinds of food - not just vegan/vegetarian. So props for that! The \"donut holes\" (don't be deceived by the name) are delicious and I loved their new \"Island Drink\" (green and fruit). I've had a TON of food from this place and always enjoyed it.  Now, a note too the not to great reviews that i read. Everyone, of course, is intitled to his/her opinion. The prices are a little upwards of what you expect for a cafe, but the woman at the counter said that EVERYTHING is organic/local when they can. Which accounts for the cost, I believe. I like to support local goods/family owned.  This is not fast food. Go here planning to spend a leisurely lunch/brunch. I also like to go during the off times, around 10am is usually good or for a snack at 3pm.   So it's true that you have to work around a couple of things, but I love this place anyway. Who doesn't want to eat food with heart?"}
{"text":"Love Pomegranate Cafe! My favorite meal has to be the elephant curry bowl, so full of wonderful flavors and textures. Don't even get me started on the drinks and desserts! I pretty much can never leave the shop without my cowgirl cookie and the rocket fuel protein smoothie...they are perfection. In fact, every dessert and smoothie I've had here has been absolutely delicious. My only con would be the prices. I have a hard time NOT indulging here, so a full meal can make a bit of a dent in my purse. The quality and service here does make it worthwhile, though."}
{"text":"On a 20 day full body cleanse and our diet is a raw food diet.  The Pomegranate Cafe is the place to go.  They over a good selection of vegan choices to choose from and the raw items were very good.  The only drawback is the raw list is limited to only 3 items as a main dish. I had the tacos vivos served on a red cabbage leaf which was very tasty and tasted just like tacos. The side salad was awesome as well. See photo of the taco vivo. My wife had the AZ roll, if you like sushi you will love the AZ roll with the texture and taste of Sushi. Also had the lemon bars afterwards, wow taste like the real deal.  Enjoy the stop and the food.   The place is clean, great work staff. And reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I saw that Pomegranate Cafe was one of the best new restaurants in Phx, so i went to Yelp to read more about it. I had lunch there this week- had the Super Green Kale Salad and thought it was fantastic! The flavors were so complex and yummy, i swooned over every bite! I left there feeling healthier!  People have commented that they felt it was pricey but worth it! I felt i totally got my mone's worth, and didn't even think about price.  Marlene and her daughter go to such extremes to discover new ways to make their recipes taste so delicious, and being all organic and  so incredibly fresh, i would've paid more than I did for the experience!  The cafe has such a friendly, neighborhood feeling, and the perfect place to go after shopping for groceries at Trader Joe's!  I highly recommend you give Pomegranate a try! You will keep it on your list of delicious, healthy eats!"}
{"text":"Great place, wonderful service, food was excellent, juice was amazing,would highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the valley hands down. Always fresh always organic. Can get just about anything gluten free or dairy free. The Dragon Bowl is awesome! The owner and her daughter run this place and both are very sweet. The staff is very knowledgeable about allergies etc.. go here and try it ! You will love it!"}
{"text":"Breakfast and lunch cafe with good coffee (each order receives its own French Press!). It's a vegetarian cafe, but don't let that scare you away. The food is very good.  I blindly stumbled upon this place without a clue as to what it was about. So, as I was perusing the menu -- scanning, scanning -- I was anxiously asking myself, \"Where's the meat?!\" Ahhh...ok; there is none. I played it cool though, like I knew this fact already, and I ordered the In Season Scramble for $8.  When my meal arrived (see picture), I was blown away! This was hearty...and delicious! Meat be damned! Who needs it? This was great stuff. The portion was generous; the flavors were exciting -- fresh and yet savory. Even the toast was very good. Oh, and the Harvest (potato & sweet potato) Hash...excellent!  The coffee was good too. They give each order it's own French Press with a mini hourglass: when the sand runs out, press down and enjoy. The coffee roast is a lot lighter than what I typically drink. It wasn't smoky or bold; instead it was light with pleasant fruit backnotes. It wasn't bad, but perhaps a hearty French Roast in the French Press would be perfect.  Overall, I'm a fan. I'll be back. I can put aside my carnivorous ways occasionally and support the Pomegranate Cafe's local, organic (and flavorful) philosophy. I wish this place the best."}
{"text":"I feel blessed to live right down the street from Pom. If i had money and time to burn i would eat there everyday. Great peeps, quality and choice organic ingredients. Not too many places in the valley where you can get kombucha beer, 100% raw treats and 100% organic infused teas and juices in one spot."}
{"text":"So far I've only had their fresh juices and the black bean quinoa salad but everything was excellent! It did take a little while to get my order but it's called the slow food movement for a reason."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. I have been here at the Phoenix location 5 times now and to the Ahwatukee this past Easter...I'll get into that experience on their Yelp page though....As for this location, every single time I've gone whether I'm dining in or placing an order to go there has always been a mistake with my order! Every Single Time! Forgetting some items, giving me one side when I asked for a different one, etc. Now, I think the food tastes great otherwise I wouldn't keep coming back especially since I live 45 minutes away but My God I hope they work out the kinks soon! Another issue I have is that the portion sizes are different every time. I understand that they make their breads in house which could cause some slight differences but when I'm paying $16 for a burger I hope to get more than the size of their happy hour menu. The staff has always been friendly, welcoming and very accommodating especially when handling their errors but there have been a few issues. One time I was sitting outside, order placed by one waitress only to have my \"real waitress\" show up and \"actually\" take my order...thus causing the wait for my food to be even longer, another time I was totally forgotten about!  I'd like to touch on their desserts before I end my review. I have tried two of their cakes, the carrot cake on Easter and the birthday cake. I thought that both actual cake parts had great flavor, however the frosting has always been wayyy to thick. I literally end up having to throw out half of the dessert because it's just frosting! I wish they would adjust the cake to frosting ratio. I have also tried a few of their cupcakes, the carrot cake one on Easter, a chocolate banana one and another that I can't remember the name of. Every one of the cupcakes has been really dry. I was surprised by that because I had both the carrot cake and carrot cupcake on Easter, the cake was moist and delicious but the cupcake was completely dry :/"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try and was super disappointed.  I ordered the breakfast scramble which would of been wonderful if it hadn't been completely drenched in oil.  The staff also needs to learn how to smile and greet people.  I sometimes pop in for coffee after yoga.  Often standing there for five minutes just wishing someone would make eye contact, smile, and say hello. It's not very big or ever super busy so out of the 3-4 people working you would think one of them could look up and say hello.  Coffee is great though.  :)"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this restaurant. I am a total vegan food snob and Pomegranate does not disappoint. It's so difficult to even choose what to order because everything is amazing. The bowls and wraps are fantastic. The Elephant Bowl, California Love Wrap, and the Macro Greens Bowl are all wonderful. The tacos are killer. The desserts are sublime. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. On my most recent trip to Phoenix and Sedona I ate at many restaurants -trying to find great food and willing to pay up for it - and the meal I had at Pomegranate stood head and shoulders above anything else."}
{"text":"love the food at this place however, Sundays are rough there I don't mind the wait I was single person so I sat at the bar and was asked 3 times would I like a waiter after about 25 minutes of just sitting there looking around I guess it's Pita Jungle for me today"}
{"text":"This was an exceptionally disappointing visit. We were excited to have a vegan alternative in our neighborhood but sadly, it did not deliver. At noon they had about ten tables inside and out (most wee twos but there were two families with small children) - they were out of the spinach dip already so we ordered the nachos with the walnut taco \"meat\" and Two wellness shots. Thirty five minutes later we got the wellness shots - the waitress explained that while there were at least eight people in the kitchen, there was only one juicer able to make the shots. Another 30 minutes later, we finally got the nachos. They were okay but had no walnut taco meat - when we asked out waitress about it, she said they had run out. It was confusing to understand why nachos with vegan cheese sauce, salsa, and a few black beans and a spoon of guacamole would take over an hour to make and why we were never told in advance the nachos would not have the signature walnut taco meat. At no time did we receive an apology for the wait, an apology for a missing key ingredient, or an offer make our visit better. There were so many details missing - staff were not attentive, water was available to some but not all, the bathrooms were not quite clean and the soap had coagulated around the pump causing it to spray all over, key ingredients for menu items were missing, and items in the menu were already gone by noon. The wall is partially painted, I assume waiting for another can of paint or someone who can cut in to finish the detail work.   Overall this is perhaps one of the biggest disappointments of new restaurants in Phoenix. I would avoid it."}
{"text":"I came here this past Easter with my family, we had a decent size group (6) so I made reservations before hand. I was excited to try this location (which is well over an hour away from me) in particular because I wanted to try the different menu options. I had even called ahead to ensure that they would be serving their regular menu items along with the Easter brunch menu and whoever I was speaking with that day had told me that they would be. Needless to say that when we got there and got our menus it was a let down to discover that they in fact were not serving food from their regular menu....We all ordered and when the food came most of the groups dishes were cold and the veggies were still mostly raw in the napoleon grilled cheese and harvest hash! It seemed like the plates had been ready to bring to us for a while so they had just been sitting out and getting cold before they were actually brought over. There were a few mix ups with drink orders on top of that as well. The front manager there (Daniella) had to come over and offered to have our cold meals redone. We eventually got our hot meals but mine was brought out with a completely empty cup where the bbq sauce was supposed to be! How do you bring over a plate and not notice that lol? I just had to laugh at that one though. The food was great once everything was done correctly and Daniella really saved the day. Our meal ended up being on the house which was really amazing of her to do! We got a few desserts, the carrot cake and carrot cupcake. The cake tasted great but had way too much frosting and the cupcake was totally try."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I'm not vegan, so I do like that they have free-range eggs. Their breakfast and wraps are delicious, love the superfood hot chocolate and the baked goods are amazing. Probably the best tiramisu and its vegan, gluten free and raw. The service is super nice. I really wish they would open more locations!"}
{"text":"I have to start by saying the food is fantastic. My main issue is that these guys can't seem to figure out how to run a kitchen. Every time we go they have a back up in the kitchen and you wait a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour for your food. Because they can't figure out their kitchen then the wait times for a table are 45-60 minutes on a Saturday or Sunday. I could understand having growing pains and correcting the issues but they don't seem to understand how to get a handle on it. This place could be a gold mine if they could turn out food faster and turn tables. If I was a server there I would be extremely frustrated because that is my livelihood and it may affect their tips (I always tip 20% or more).  I can't understand how the new location will be successful considering the problems they have at this location. Why not focus on one location and make it perfect before moving onto opening a new location. Such a shame because as I said food here is the bomb but you have to come with allot of patience and low expectations for service time."}
{"text":"Does healthy have to mean small portions? I ate sandwich  split side order of \"fries\" and split a desert 2 hours later I am hungry again and out about $30.   I do like the concept local veggies, meat free food and contemporary atmosphere. But $12 for a BLT and $11 for a Kale salad was a bit steep for a place where I order at the counter, refill my own water etc..    This is the crux of my issue the lack of value.   The BLT it self was decent, the Tempeh bacon was a bit sparse, the tomatoes were good as were the greens. The Side of hummus was bland and came with a few fresh veggies.  The Kale salad was good with a large flax seed chip, fresh kale and many other ingredients.  The pomfrits (french fries) were not as great mealy slices of potato under cooked in oil.  The Desert the almond joy $4 was quite decadent and tasty , however we decided to get this later on and had to wait in the slow line to order to get this."}
{"text":"Not happy with this place any longer. Not much as far as raw is concerned. Seems like they sold out in order to bring in the customers who want to try to be healthy. My avo sandwich was good but not blow my mind good. They need to offer the raw stuff on Sunday's too. They also screwed up order. I am not interested in coming back again."}
{"text":"I love the concept of Pomegranate Cafe.   It's a vegetarian restaurant that promotes healthy and clean eating. They have lots of gluten free options or gluten free substitutes, so it might be a good place to go to for people who have allergy concerns. They serve lots of organic and local produce, and have cute hip decorations. The water that they served had cucumbers in it and came in little mason jars, so yeah, trendy. It was quite busy even on a Friday afternoon, which shows that many people enjoy coming to Pomegranate Cafe.   I had the breakfast burrito some time ago, and I liked it a lot. This time, I ordered the protein bowl, which was great. I loved the scoop of pesto-macadamia-avocado topping on top of the eggs. To be honest, I feel like I might have been able to make the protein bowl on my own with lots and lots of great veggies and eggs, but I appreciated that the cafe served dishes where people could could decipher what was in their food. My mom got the Athena wrap, which she liked, and my sister got the Kung Pao Burrito; she was sweating by the time she ate half of her burrito because it was spicy.   The only downside about this restaurant was the price; it was a lot pricier than I expected it to be. To be fair, there were lots of organic produce that went into creating the dishes, so I can tell why the prices were higher. I would go more often if the prices weren't so high; overall, I would give this place 4.5 stars if possible but rounded up because of the amount of thought that must have gone to making healthy foods tasty.   Bottom line: Trendy and hip vegetarian restaurant that promotes clean eating... with flavor. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Definitely liked this place even more than green. The rainbow wrap was delicious, fresh and filling."}
{"text":"They get super busy and mess up on orders a lot and pretty upsetting when they're. It working on the orders in which they come in!  Seems they're always slow on to go orders and making other people's food first that order way after!"}
{"text":"If youre into eating healthy...this place is perfect! Great smoothies as well. The only reason i didnt give ot 5 stars is because the one time I went it took forever to get our food. But the servers were nice and the food/smoothies were worth the wait."}
{"text":"THIS IS REALLY GOOD VEGETARIAN FOOD.   The spices are spot-on and accentuate the vegetarian-based dishes, which is hard to do.  The \"meat\" patties for burgers are delectable and made of walnut and mushrooms.  Again, his alone is hard to ached in the many vegetarian restaurants I have eaten at.  Nice work!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I wanted to try a raw vegan meal and we loved this place! We tried a couple different entrees and the food was amazing! I highly recommend the raw sushi roll! So good and tasty! The tacos were amazing too! My daughter tried one of their juice blends and she loved it. The servers were very friendly and efficient even though they were very busy at the time we were there. The ambiance was nice. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone that wants a wonderful raw vegan meal! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"As someone who is not vegan or vegetarian, I thought this place was pretty good! I went with a friend who is vegan and she was very impressed with everything. The set up inside is a bit jammed but it definitely has a local feel. I don't know if I would be back by myself but if I have someone that's vegan or vegetarian coming into town I'll definitely take them here."}
{"text":"Loved the Passion Juice. The ginger flavor was subtle, but it elevated the juice significantly. I had the Beet POM burger, which was good but not great. Would definitely go back to try more specials."}
{"text":"It really doesn't get any better than this! You could close your eyes and pick anything on the menu and you'll love it! Beautiful , healthy and creative food. The owner is so sweet and the staff so friendly. If I could eat at Pomegranate  everyday I would!"}
{"text":"Hip, trendy, in the edges of chandler?  It's  hip but it's also really good.  The juices are creative and exotic.  The prices are a bit steep--but not for the quality."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place really bad so I'll probably give it another chance but my food was not good. The menu was a little pricey so I went with the least expensive option, buffalo cauliflower (which I love and make all the time). The cauliflower I got was slightly cooked with a lot of pepper and a thin coat of buffalo sauce. It also came with veggies and a spread that looked like hummus but tasted very strange. I'll try one of the $15 burritos or sandwiches next time. Other than the food, staff was nice and restaurant was clean with cute decor. Hoping my next experience changes my mind."}
{"text":"I never like to give reviews if I don't have only nice things to say....but....while their food is very very good, the service wasn't the best. I have now ordered over the phone three times and every time was given \"20 minutes\" and my office being 5 minutes away i leave at the 20-minute mark-effectively giving them 25 minutes. Upon arrival the first time, I waited an additional 15 minutes. Second time, same scenario, waited 20 minutes and no kidding the third time I waited an additional 40 minutes to get my food. I finally went to the counter and the employee went and looked around and found my food that had been sitting there for who knows how long. Cold and soggy vegan food. I don't honestly know if I would go back."}
{"text":"Kinda new place but no growing pains when I was there.  Our server was knowledgeable, pleasant, and quick.  We ordered the nachos and didn't expect this thing to be that huge.  Vegans don't have THAT big of an appetite!  Definitely didn't need to order anything else after that but we ordered a chicken burrito as an entree...it ended up in a togo box.  The nachos were the best tasting vegan nachos I've had in Phoenix.  There's a place in Seattle called, No Bones About It that has better nachos but I'm so glad Phoenix had a relatively healthy vegan option for good nachos.  Our server recommended a couple of drinks and they were good.  This place is kind of spendy but totally worth it for healthier vegan options.  Way better than the options further south. I won't name names but your greasy vegan food ass know who you are."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The servers are all super nice and helpful and the food is so tasty! I went for the first time a few weeks ago after Spin class next door. A friend and I split a \"chicken\" burrito which was delicious and I also got the Tumeric Latte which was SO good. I've been thinking about it since! I then took my husband here a couple weeks later for breakfast. I got the Avocado sandwich which was amazing!! My husband tried the French toast which was good but a little too sweet for both of us. Also tried a caramel latte which was very good. Prices are a bit high but I am ok with that knowing I am putting good quality food in my body. You get what you pay for. I will definitely be putting this place on my small list of restaurants to dine out at."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.  I like healthy foods, but I usually find vegan food to be gritty or bland or dry.  This food was more delicious than I've had at places that use fat and eggs and butter and all that good stuff.  We went back twice in a row.  The cinnamon french toast was soft and flavorful.  Tiny apple slices brought a medley of tastes.  My friends enjoyed their omelets.  The juices were a little funky for me, but if you like a kick of ginger and spices, you'll have plenty to choose from.  The decor is colorful and inviting, and there always seemed to be tables open.  The staff is young and helpful, and seem to enjoy working there.  They patiently help you navigate the menu.  Some aren't quite focused when it comes to fixing mistakes (you wanted which sauce?  um, okay, be back in ten minutes...), but it's more cluelessness than apathy.  Overall, good for a leisurely and healthy brunch/lunch.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice atmosphere. I was skeptical when looking at the menu and all the vegan offerings (sometimes vegetarian restaurants try a little too hard to be creative), but this was the best sandwich I've had in a long time (Sunizona BLT). I chose the side of hummus with vegetables; also excellent. The only drawback is it's a little pricey ($13 for a sandwich and side)."}
{"text":"Pom has continued to thrive and grow for good reason. Great service, continued quality food and a fun atmosphere with daily specials that tempt even this staunch creature of habit!   Dragon Bowl & Green Protein Bowl are still my favorites. The bean burrito for breakfast is delicious as well.   Thanks Pom for keeping up the good healthy fight!"}
{"text":"I have a gluten intoletance and hardly eat out. My sister dragged me there and I am happy she did!  Portions huge! I had the mushroom burger on a homemade gluten free bread! Delicious!!! I was so full! As a dessert I had the lemon bar! I highly recommend it. The kitchen and the rest of the facility is clean! Food and desserts delicious. My wild cream drink with jalapenos was too HOT! I tried to soften the spice out with milk but that didn't work. A little pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"I am completely infatuated with this cafe. I live in Orange County where the raw vegan vegetable restaurant selection isn't so up to par.  Yes, yes, I know it is a nieche market but asking for a fresh healthy vegetable selection when eating out shouldnt be like pulling teeth. Sure we have Native Foods, Au Lac, and 118 degrees but Pomegranate Cafe has captured my heart. The atmosphere is completely unintimidating and the owner is perhaps the most delightful woman I've ever spoken to. She is so personable and I'm pretty sure she personally spoke to every patron in the place in the hour that I ate there.   But I digress... Onward to the food!!! My mother and I ordered the rainbow wrap and the sizzling sesame salad.   The sizzling sesame salad was composed of a sesame tofu, chili spiced almonds and an orange dressing. They rely on flavors versus sauces in this dish and I found it rather refreshing. The hit of spicy and sweet is one of my favorite combinations so this one was really a win.   The rainbow wrap was full of fresh crisp veggies and I had the hummus of the day as a side. ( It was a spicy red pepper hummus if I remember correctly.) The texture was gorgeously fresh  and paired wonderfully with the crispy crunchy carrots, cucumbers, and red bell peppers. The wrap had a cashew \"cheeze\". Which is usually a soaked cashew puréed with different seasonings. It all danced and sung together in my mouth. Yes, I am willing to speak in metaphores because I loved it all so much.   I cook fairly similar to this at home so it's nice to find a place away from home that can treat food properly without relying on fats and butters and actually tastes good with out being 'bland' healthy."}
{"text":"For a veggie lover, it is really hard to go wrong with Pom. They have the most extensive veggie/gluten-free menu I've ever seen in the Phx Metropolitan area. {The menu is literally a booklet}.  It's also not just a winner because of the food. Their lattes and smoothies are the zenith of local nutritional fancy beverage (holla @ the coconut caramel latte & hibiscus cooler). You are definitely paying a steep price for some of the options here, but hey, if theyre made with the sweet nector of forbidden fire fruit and blended cashew milk, maybe theyre worth the $10? Definitely just get them because they're served in a Mason jar. Even your cucumber water here is served in a Mason jar. This place is kitschy and rustic and very instagram friendly. For the best shot, make sure you get the cactus centerpiece in {see my examples below}.   Also, a short word on their desserts: they all look nice. They don't all taste nice. Such is the reality of sugar alternatives.   OH and before I completely forgot, their happy hour is dope. Definite go between 4 and 6 for the best value on already good food. {Pom, your Nachos and Wraps are Killing IT}."}
{"text":"Such an amazing restaurant and the only vegan one I have so close to home. The vibe there is so amazing and so is the service. They have only \"messed up\" once, of the numerous times I've Been there, and immediately apologized and offered me compensation. They said the food was taking a while to come out but to be honest, I didn't even notice, which just shows how diligent they are. The food there is amazing, I would recommend the curry bowl, sushi or rolls ,as they call them there, and the coconut brownie...as a drink the coconut mocha was amazing, never disappointed by this place."}
{"text":"Gone downhill over the years. I'm hoping their new location opening in Jan 2018 will have the level of attention I used to love at Pomegranate cafe.   I visited recently for brunch. We were seated and they had trouble finding menus for the 4 us despite there only being 5-6 full tables in the restaurant. Then we ordered drinks and it took at least 15 minutes for them to pour a glass of wine and make an arnold palmer.   I ordered Cassie's Latte after asking the waiter if it would be super sweet. He said no. Since I'm familiar with their raw/unrefined sugar treats, I knew they likely wouldn't let me down. The latte was actually sickeningly sweet - like Starbucks sweet. As a replacement, I asked for a regular iced latte with coconut milk. This time, there was maybe half a shot of espresso in it instead of the usual two. Plus, I was expecting the style of coconut milk you buy in a carton (aka normal). Instead the milk was more akin to the full fat coconut milk you buy in a can for baking. It's not good on its own in a drink, super gross. There was another woman in the restaurant who sent back a smoothie 3 times so I think the person working the drink station was having a bad day.   We also ordered the shakshuka brunch dish and it took them 10 minutes to tell us they were out of it, requiring us to go through the menu again for a backup.   We ordered a little over an hour before they were scheduled to close for the day. We were also planning to order a few dishes to-go, at the end of our meal. About 35 minutes went by and we hadn't received our food so my husband figured it'd be best to order our to-go items at the takeout counter in front, so they wouldn't close the kitchen for the day first. The man behind the counter said we had to order from our server, despite not having seen him in nearly 40 minutes.   The food finally arrived about 1 hour after sitting down, which seems a little crazy for 4 egg dishes. I ordered soup too and they brought it with my main dish. How hard is it to run a cup of soup out in 45 mins?   We managed to order our to-go food eventually, and that came out way faster than the boxes we requested for leftovers. Saw the waiter laughing in the back with the other servers and talking about hangovers in between serving tables.   Later we tried to order dessert from the waiter but couldn't chase him down. Asked the man behind the counter, he told us once again we had to order from the waiter only.   All-in-all, it took about 1.5 hours for breakfast, which made me really impatient. Nothing they did was outright offensive on its own, but altogether made for a messy dining experience. I really want them to get it together because Pom Cafe has been one of my favorite restaurants in PHX for years."}
{"text":"Awesome vegan food and great staff. The vibe inside is also very cool with nice music, art, and ambiance."}
{"text":"Trying out the new location because we love the first one. We ordered buffalo cauliflower,  pom burger, and crispy chicken.  I wish we had more of the cauliflower. The crispy chicken (when i can find it) weren't crispy. The pom burger were good size for $16 but the bun were dry and pattie were falling apart. I wish i didn't feel like a 4 year old using the forks they had. Over all i think they still have some growing pain. The potential is there, but the Ahwatukee location definitely had better product."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp as I was looking for a hearty but healthy last breakfast in Arizona before I headed back to the East Coast freeze. I wish I had more time to try more items on the menu as they all looked so good! I should have taken a snack for the road...  First, the drinks: the cucumber water was a nice touch! The coffee was pleasantly surprising. When I saw the big dispensers and the self serve coffee I was skeptical. The coffee was GREAT. I drink my coffee black and the flavor was awesome.   Next, the food: I got the breakfast tacos with eggs (rather than tofu) and no cheese. The veggies were awesome! The salsa and the guac were perfect touches and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.   Last, the service: friendly and speedy.   Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place. I am very into raw/vegan food and was excited to see that they served fresh food that suited my palate.   I went this week with my son and friend and the bill was close to $35. For a small serving of food I was really surprised at the price they charged. In fact, I had a juice a two sides in order not to spend $10 on kale.   The juice I had (kale, coconut water, berries, etc) was really good. The portion size was nice and I noticed that they had other really good veggie/fruit combos. I think that if you are into juice and have money to burn then this should be your go to place.   As I mentioned before, I chose to have sides to avoid their high plate prices. The pasta salad was pretty bad. The beet salad was also very bad. The beets were cooked, which I didn't expect and there was no dressing on the salad. It was just really bland and not at all what I expected.   My son had a quesadilla and it was really small. They gave him a few carrots and half a cookie which made the $4 price tag ok. I nibbled on all of these and was totally unimpressed. No thought goes into the kids meals apparently. He gulped half of my juice, which was good.   My friend had a falafel and a potatoes that were served with a pomegranate bbq sauce. I only tasted the potatoes and sauce and it was actually quite good.   After lunch I bought some macaroons and donut holes (all raw) out of the deli case and they were ok. I liked them but they didn't wow me.   I think that you should try this restaurant out for yourself. I really hope that your experience is better than mine. I really, really want to give this place a 5. In fact, I was hesitant to write this review just because I want them to succeed. I don't this can happen if they don't improve their menu and pricing. I will not return to pay $35 for mediocre food. It pains me to say this, but my first visit will be my last visit."}
{"text":"I got a lemonade and a burger. It was $26. No thank you. WAYYYYYYYYYYY too $$ for what I got."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with a couple girl friends. This is such a cute place! A bright, open dining space with colorful (and slightly girly) decorations. I love the local environmentally-conscious vibe, and the staff are really friendly!  I ordered the In-Season Egg Scramble, which came with a delicious stir fry of fresh vegetables, and yummy multi-grain toast! I love their toast! Much more fun than the regular wheat toast at most breakfast places, with a yummy berry jam! My friends ordered the multi-grain toast with almond butter, which was beautifully plated (with pomegranate seed topping!) and looked delicious as well! (And is a good way to go if you don't want a large portion). The best part, nothing felt heavy/greasy!  They also have an assortment of baked goods and desserts, which looked delicious! And they have complimentary cucumber water, which was super refreshing! I'm excited to come back and try their juices as well!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They always have the most unique specials. Definitely a place everyone needs to try, even if you're not vegan/vegetarian.  Service is slow most of the time, but once you get your food it makes up for that extra time."}
{"text":"Not usually a vegetarian or vegan lover, but this place is great. The street tacos were terrific. Extremely tasty and filling. Service was great. Excellent great tasting desserts. I have a flour allergy. There are many choices. Can't wait to go back when they have the gluten free brownies. They had sold out before I got there. Must have a super pastry chef. The pastries we're very popular."}
{"text":"Kudos for being healthy, vegan, and offering raw options. Poor value and food is only ok. I ordered the bountiful bowl because I was not able to order the enchiladas due it being \"brunch hour\" at 11am. Ok, no problem.  The small-ish bowl was just OK. It came with a dry, undressed salad with corn chips that tasted like they came out of a bag, and consisted of 75% unseasoned quinoa. All for a mere $14 plus tax. The cost of ingredients that went into the bowl couldn't have been more than $3.00. Service and ambience not worth $12. I left disappointed.  Skip anything with \"walnut taco meat\". It tastes like walnuts, not taco meat. I probably won't come back, but I'm sure this place will improve over time. They have a lot of potential but need to work on the menu and value proposition. For the amount being paid there are other, better vegan options nearby."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Everything was great,  huge portions for the bowls and no meat, really cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the biggest reasons why I love Pomegranate cafe is because it reminds me of the restaurant that I used to work at. The food is all vegan (besides eggs during brunch), the music is fun, and the staff is awesome. I've been to Pom quite a few times now and every time, I leave satisfied.  The first time I came, I tried their vegan Mac and raw tacos. I'm not a raw vegan and the tacos weren't quite my cup of tea, but the Mac was pretty good and the cupcake I had for dessert was even better.  I also visited Pom on my birthday and had the most amazing nachos, which my boyfriend and I ended up coming back for within the same week because we loved them so much. They have this killer happy hour deal where select apps are half off, and the nachos are included. So. Good!!  More recently I visited Pom alone for Sunday brunch after taking the GRE and I tried their French toast. It tastes more healthy than decadent, but I actually like that sort of thing so I wasn't mad haha.  To close, if just like to say that I'm happy to have found Pomegranate Cafe and my only complaint is that they should have a Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Caution!!!! I ate there about 1 week ago and almost exactly 24 hours later I was experiencing severe stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, and just felt like hell. I am not 100% positive it was from this place, but given the timing and the fact that this was the only place where my girlfriend didn't eat the same thing I did, I'm pretty damn sure. I had a vegetable juice with a salad and my guess is they either didn't wash the veggies well enough or aren't washing their hands/equipment well enough. It's been almost 1 week and I am still experiencing symptoms. Considering how sick I got from this place I will probably never eat there again. Caution!!!!  If you have been sick from this place as well, please report them to the county health department so no one else has to go through the same thing."}
{"text":"Amazing food accompanied by amazing service.  Also, if you're lucky, you'll get Stephanie as a server. Very attentive, kind and helpful. A great meal for vegans and non-vegans. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great vegan restaurant! Love coming here. Music sometimes to loud . But food is great !"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!  First time to his location and it did not disappoint. Order raw taco special and it provided a great expression of textures and flavors."}
{"text":"Love this healthy funky cafe. The servers always are able to recommend something new and delicious. I've heard people at tables next to me complaining about how thins tasted. They do a really good job at turning healthy food into something that you wouldn't usually associate with being healthy. So if your expecting the real thing then this won't be the place for you. But if you love healthy food that tastes great you'll love it. Also, really enjoy there  read made in house. My only complaint is the price. The smoothies run me $10! And a latte for $5! A little over priced all around but because the food is so good I keep coming back."}
{"text":"I promise I come here every time I go to Phoenix! I ALWAYS get the nachos. They are crazy good!! Sooooo, this time I got the tumeric latte and the Arizona roll! And of course, the nachos!! I usually split my meal with someone else and this time was no different. I like my drinks on the stronger side so I usually don't divulge in their alcoholic beverages. Everything else there is amazing. One of my favorites to visit on my frequent trips to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! The workers were extremely helpful and kind and the vegan quesadilla that I got was divine. Do not miss out on this place if you're in the area-- it is an absolute gem!"}
{"text":"Vegans! Alas! I've finally found a place that dishes are mighty flavorful and healthy. Let's start with the elephant curry bowl with tofu and brown rice. It was incredibly delicious. Carrots and purple cabbage brought the crunch while the soft curry bathed rice and tofu almost melted in my mouth.   The enchilada style burrito supreme tantalized my tastebuds. Each ingredient playfully danced in unison among the authentic Mexican spices.   Last, but definitely not least, the country mushroom soup. Quinoa, corn, onion and vegetable broth were tied up perfectly with the mushrooms. I was never a fan of the fungus, until now. I've rescinded my hatred and replaced it with love.   Pomegranate Cafe, we will be back. I'll be longing to try other items on the menu until we meet again."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recently told me about Pomegranate Cafe in Ahwatukee. I didn't know that all their menu items are vegan---how cool is that? All the baked goods and menu items are vegan, but they do offer eggs (instead of tofu for breakfast/brunch items) and dairy cheese (instead of vegan Diaya cheese) to appeal to vegetarians.   We went for a late afternoon lunch today and ordered pomegranate iced green tea, roasted red pepper hummus platter, and tempeh BLT sandwiches. The tea was tart and naturally sweet; very refreshing. The hummus was tasty and served with vegetables and warm bread slices. The BLT was simply awesome. I have to learn how to get my tempeh to taste like theirs! The baked goods looked way too good to pass up. So, against my waistlines wishes, we got 2 slices of vegan cake (lemon with strawberry frosting), raw vegan donut holes and coconut macaroons to take home. I will say that the donut holes don't actually taste like donuts, but they were still delicious. The cake was so amazing that I muttered to my husband that we need to order a whole cake (I'll have to see if they offer whole cakes...it was like wedding cake-good). I wish I could have tried everything on the menu...I just have to make plans to visit often. The berry pepita french toast sounds absolutely divine...for next time."}
{"text":"This place continues to hit the mark when it comes to ROCKING great vegan food.. I recently had corn muffins with Southwestern gravy, roasted potatoes and a tofu scramble - OMG good.  Hubby had the most huge cinnamon roll and we both had lattes. THEN we took a bunch of desserts to a party we were attending - gluten-free and more.  LOVED that because I didn't have to cook in order to bring something delicious.  Whenever we are in Phoenix.. Pomegranate Cafe is on our \"must eat\" list.."}
{"text":"Great Cafe. Seating outside wonderfully food friendly staff. Had a fresh made juice with your meal."}
{"text":"We usually love this place and give it a lot of support but today we had quite a bad experience. We ordered a curry elephant bowl and a casadilla. Our server waited until our food was about to come out to tell us they were out of the stuff for the elephant bowl and it will be 20 more minutes fir the dragon bowl. Very annoying. Then the casadilla came out and was very different from last time, had no cheese on it, and was kind of awful. The nachos had a minuscule amount of cheese and when we asked the server why things were so different he acted surprised like he didn't know what we were talking about.  I think we will be taking a break from this place for a while. At these prices they cant afford poor service and subpar food.   So the manger came over before we left and we told her what happened. She cut our bill in half and apologized, explaining there is a new chef.  She was very nice about it and we appreciate her listening. Also, we bought some cowgirl chocolate tarts to go and they were the bomb!"}
{"text":"Love POM! Used to drive from Avondale to Ahwatukee just for the chocolate cake! Love the new location in Phoenix!  The Cashew yogurt was fabulous!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant!! My husband and I come here a few times a month for date night. We always get the Arizona Roll and Gila Monster Nachos, but this past time we also split the Baja Burger... so delicious. The whole meal was simply amazing! Thank you Pomegranate Cafe!!"}
{"text":"Service is always a bit slow, but the food makes up for it. My Favorite breakfast place and part of their profits go towards providing children with healthy lunches. Way to go."}
{"text":"Great combinations of healthy food.  I'm a fan of the smoothies as well.  Kind of pricey, but not unreasonably so."}
{"text":"We love EVERYTHING here! The atmosphere, the staff (especially Stephanie), the food, the drinks, the desert. As vegans with allergies to gluten and dairy, there is no place we would rather eat!"}
{"text":"I'm only going to give a three star rating because of the lady at the register was helpful and courteous otherwise I was not very impressed. Now let me state it smelt great but the food is way to pricy to want to come back. Plus not once was i greeted at the door with a \"hello, welcome in\" but I waiting patiently and before I knew it I was being cut off in the line by a guy looking at the snack bar and ready to pay his bill. I spoke up that I was already in line and he gave me my spot back but stood right behind me so close that I could hear his comments . then a hostess/waiter came up to him and stated \"just trying to pay your bill?\" he then followed with \" yes and they should have moved her to someone else, I'll be speaking with so and so\"  coming in as a NEW customer unfamiliar with the way this place works I was unsure of where to go or if there were several lines for different things plus again nobody had greeted me. To close this off I felt very low and that my business did not matter so I'm sadly saying I'm not going to be coming back which sucks for me because I really wanted to enjoy this place. So you got your way buddy someone else will be helping me!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. They forgot that we were seated; the group that came in after us was given their food before we could even place our order. We had to walk up to the front to get a waiter to take our order. After we did, the waiter lost our order and was looking for it for at least 15 minutes before asking us to reorder. For the high price of the items, you would think the service would be good, but not at all. It took us nearly an hour to get our food."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's difficult to really feel satisfied with a raw vegan diet , but every time I go to Pomegranate's I leave more than satisfied.   The atmosphere is welcoming and delightful, although very busy during the lunch rush. I did have to share a table with a stranger last time I was there but the stranger turned out to be a great lunch companion.  This is a must for anyone who is considering (or already is) a raw and/or vegan diet.  Everything is so yummy you won't know it is good for you!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!  Service was wonderful and the food arrived quickly!  I had the cinnamon swirl French toast and it was to die for!  My partner had the red pepper and garlic scramble and it too was outstanding!  Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Such a shame. This is the exact kind of restaurant Im always looking for. Too bad the staff are oblivious to basic customer service. I've never been in, so i asked if I seat myself or wait to be seated. This question really threw the waiter for a loop. He just didn't know how to answer. Because I was carrying my laptop bag- he was more concerned on whether or not a was giving a lecture or something. Very strange... Then I had a seat, but no one came to my table to take my order. So, I notice the \"order here\" sign. I got up and asked, \"is this where I order?\". They responded, \"wherever....\".    It was like pulling teeth to figure out whether I seat myself or wait to be seated, whether a server takes my order or I order at the counter. It shouldn't be so hard to spend $20+ on a lunch and drink. Long story short- I just can't support a company with staff that are that confused and oblivious as to the basic functions of their job or just basic guest service.  I've never seen a place with such confused employees. I mean, who can't say whether its seat yourself or not? Who can't say whether a server will take your order or whether you order at the counter?   Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, but the service was fairly slow. Don't go there if you need a quick lunch, but if you have the time, you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"My hubs and I love this place. The first time we found it by searching online for veg-friendly places. We found this one, came with family for his bday, and it's been a tradition ever since. Unfortunately, it's far from where we live. We were in N. Scottsdale and now we're in N. Phoenix, so it's always been a hike. But it's been a hike worth taking! The food is amazing and ever changing. We usually like to check out whatever is on the daily specials board. The desserts are equisite! We even had them make our wedding cake (berry lemon ginger vegan cheesecake). My favorite drink is Cassie's latte, either hot or cold. The lumberjack sandwich, the almond joy, the quesadillas...all amazing and vegan! (or with eggs and cheese for other tastes). Everyone is friendly and helpful. And, it's great to see the owners rolling up their sleeves and doing hard work too. Our only regret is we don't live closer to come every week!"}
{"text":"After Matt's encouragement to return, and letting me know the pancackes I had were prepared, not according to recipe, I returned today.  And, so very glad I did!  He was working, and after a bit of discussion I decided on the \"in season scramble\".   He had me at \"seasonal hash\".   I opted for eggs, vegan cheese and requested a side of the salsa, as I do like eggs spiced up a bit it.   The whole grain toast perfect, not too seedy or bland.   The hash; a combination of roasted butternut squash, yukon potatoes and sweet potatoes forced me to devour every morsel.   The fresh squeezed orange juice reminded me to pull out my juicer, so worth the effort.   Marlene offered me a seasonal spice cookie.   Yeah, ate that as soon as I got home, Fall has arrived.    This family owned gem is in my neighborhood, I so want it to endure all the strip mall changes locally.  I will bring friends and family, one can pig-out and feel good about it.   Thank you Matt for the 2nd chance, everyone deserves one.  I look forward to many more healthy meals.  Congrats on making in the Top New Restaurants, of Phx. Magazine.  Quite an accomplishment, for the litte restaurant who does make big healthy meals, vegan or not."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing every time I go. Now with two locations I can go more. I've tried most of their menu but I particularly love their Arizona Rolls. Big portions and even my picky meat eating brother loves their food. Don't leave with out taking some of their raw desserts home. The Samoa cookie is my favorite next to the cowgirl cookie."}
{"text":"The Pumpkin French Toast (gluten-free) was delicious.   The server, Austin, is very charming.  I highly recommend the Pomegranate café."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. I'm not a vegetarian, but I enjoyed the BBQ veggie quesadilla. The food was flavorful and tasted fresh and healthy. And it was plenty of food, I was stuffed!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of a restaurant that proclaimed a vegan menu, but I'm so glad I read the reviews and gave it a shot! I took my husband and two young sons there for brunch and we were treated to a great meal. Service was a bit slow but could say it was laid back and relaxed I guess. I had a maca smoothie that was incredibly flavorful and the seedy toast with strawberries and nutty butter. It was fantastic! The kids enjoyed their breakfast burrito and eggs/toast meals, and my husband was in love with the special he ordered, but I couldn't tell you what it was other than some eggs and lots of spicy vegetables! Eggs are an alternative to tofu you can order on any menu item for an extra $1 if you prefer. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So happy to finally have one of these in Phoenix! They have a sinful selection of desserts and the staff is very friendly. Get the cowgirl cookie!!! Rick even gave me dog cookie that they make in house for free! Oh and the drip coffee is not to be missed, Rick told me it tastes like blueberries and he was right!! I would go back just for that coffee!  Thank you guys for the excellent service and amazing cruelty free food. Photo below is of their version of a \"sushi\" roll. Very fresh and delicious. I would get it again."}
{"text":"Wonderful service! Our server was so sweet and helpful, and provided great recommendations. Our 2 year old loved his French toast, and he got run around the patio in the misters. The dragon bowl was so yummy, and big enough to share. Wish we were in town at 3 o'clock for their happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  My husband and I are gluten free and dairy free. His birthday was coming up and I had yet to bake some sort of birthday cake... (Not my strong point) so I had heard that Pomegranate had a small selection of desserts that were gluten free. Desperate NOT to bake myself I went in,... Low and behold I hit the mother load of deliciousness!  There were so many options that we could both have it was amazing! Since I could not decide, we got pretty much one of everything (some items we did get 2 of) and there was not 1 thing that I tried that was not fantastic!  Even my children who crave refined sugar and corn syrup and various garbage thought everything was delicious.  It was not until AFTER they had ingested it all did I mention that they were actually healthy treats!  I cannot wait to go back very soon!"}
{"text":"A huge improvement, a complete turn-around. As though Mr. Happy himself has been imbued into the staff here.   Upon arrival, it was empty but then started filling up. The wait staff and hostess at the counter were pleasant and very helpful.   Upon ordering we received our little flag and found our table to sit. The brownie was brought out first. Very quick this time around. Not more then 5 mins. And within a minute more, another person brought out our drink. She was gracious and very polite, making the experience so much more delightful.   Within a few more minutes, a younger waitstaff came around to let us know our food will be next. Also very polite, and not sassy.   Once again, a complete turnaround from our previous experience. All the i's dotted all the t's crossed. And not just for us, we witnessed the same pleasant demeanor for every guest that came to eat. Always someone stopping by to ask how the meal is, everything to our satisfaction. Perfect - Delicious - Very Hospitable and Friendly  4 stars is only because the restroom needed a little pickme up.   fin"}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I love the concept of this restaurant. They focus all of their efforts on local, and organic produce in almost all of their dishes. The restaurant itself is decorated super nice and the overall atmosphere is awesome. My wife and I decided to share a wrap that was stuffed with a bunch of fresh veggies and tofu. The overall flavor of the wrap was good, but I felt like it was lacking something. I did put on one of the hot sauces that they offer and that made it really flavorful. It came with a pretty generous portion of a side salad. While I do understand that serving organic produce can hike up the prices, the price for the wrap was a little steep at $15. However, it was actually a pretty good sized wrap despite the price point. We also ordered a specialty pancake that I was not a fan of at all. I also ordered a side of chips and salsa and I did like the flavor of the salsa but the chips texture were a little off. We really wanted to try a dessert but we were pretty full so we decided against it. I would love to come back, however I would need to order something different to wow me a little more."}
{"text":"Love this place, so glad to have a veg friendly cafe for when I'm in town visiting fam! Love the POM milk in my coffee...and the rest of the menu,well, I pretty much wanna eat it all! :)  Also, very friendly staff which is always a huge plus."}
{"text":"We've been going at least twice a month since this friendly, family owned cafe opened a few years ago. Their vegan/vegetarian menu is creative and full of delicious organic ingredients. I love the Wild Western Tacos for breakfast. And for lunch either the avocado sandwich or elephant curry. (Not made from elephants.... C'mon!)  The smoothies and fresh juices are expensive but delicious. In fact that can be said of everything on the menu! However this is very much factored away when you consider their use of fresh, local, organic ingredients and very attentive service. My favorite juice is the cold and flu buster but often I just go for the fresh squeezed oj. This is the best place to get one of these I've found since moving to the valley 8 yrs ago."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. My siblings are vegetarians from San Francisco and this is A favorite spot when they visit. Never had a problem here and food is delicious. :)"}
{"text":"Best vegitiarian selection so have found.  A bit on the expensive side but worth it.  Gluten Free RED Velvet cupcake for my birthday pre order recommend. One sweet treat!  The also have baked sweet potato fries you just want to dive into.  Those alone could make a meal.  Local sourced food with green environment.  All around a great place for healthy foods disguised as sheer decadence."}
{"text":"We love this cafe! So many yummy options. Our kids love that they can order anything off the menu and it is all vegan.  Many gluten free options as well. Kids Mac and cheese was a huge hit and the tofu scramble delicious. If only we lived nearby.... Still, anytime we come through Phoenix we make a point to stop."}
{"text":"This is my second review of this restaurant. The first time I went when they opened, I wasn't impressed with the food selections and slow service thus my first bad review. But overtime, they really have IMPROVED-they vamped up the menu and the service is MUCH better. So kudos to them! My favorites are Arizona Rolls and Living Caesar Salad as well as their smoothies and coffee! I am happy to say I go there once or twice/week-their vegan selections are delicious! I'm also glad that it is conveniently located in my area."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that POM opened a second location and so much closer to where I live! Though I was willing to drive 45 minutes to their other location, I'm happy I don't have to anymore. And their new location has longer hours!  I love POM for everything they do ... the owner has created such a beautiful business that is trying to stick to their mission for healthy, organic, [mainly] vegan, sourcing locally ... and that's a hard thing to do. So I'm thoroughly impressed with their ability to stay true to their roots!  Their staff are friendly and nice and knowledgeable. They work hard and wear many hats, that I can see. I've always had a great experience with dining in.  Now their food, desserts and drinks! Everything is so yummy. I have yet to try something that I don't enjoy. I've tried almost everything and my favorites are:  Desserts: Cookie Dough POM Truffle Cookie Dough Brownie Superseed Ball Dog Treats (for the pup!)  Entrees: RAW Everything Bagel Buffalo Cauliflower Athena's Salad Wild Western Tacos RAW Tacos Vivos Bountiful Bowl Gila Monster Nachos  Drinks: Cold & Flu Buster Superfood Hot Chocolate POMilk Shake Coconut Caramel Latte"}
{"text":"An update to my previous review:  I absolutely love POM and so does my pup! Their original location is cute, fun, and vibrant. They have friendly staff and delicious food and pastries. I can't get enough of their food! I've tried almost everything on their menu without disappointment. I haven't tried all of their desserts, but the ones I have tried are phenomenal.  One thing to note, if you've never been or only been a few times ... it WILL take a while for your food to come out - and that has nothing to do with their abilities. It's because they make their food fresh and more-often-than-not from scratch! So be kind and patient, because it'll be well worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is probably as close to a 5 star rating as it can be without being a 5 star. If you like raw, organic and natural food then this is a great mix of food choices with all sorts of flavors, delicious smoothies, teas, coffee and sundry other treats. Oh and don't forget to make them work behind the counter when you ask for 2 oz wheat grass shot. Love 'em! Yes, the prices are not cheap but well made food with honest to goodness good ingredients does not come cheap. You can eat cheap at fast food restaurants and we all know all to well what can happen in a paltry 30 days thanks to Mr. Spurlock. If you want to eat healthy and enjoy a tasty meal in the process I give Pomegranate Cafe a two thumbs up! Come on by and give them a shot. Of course I meant the wheat grass shot! :-)"}
{"text":"For a vegan, this spot is a must see. The atmosphere is comfortable and eye catching and the staff is very knowledgeable about vegan needs. We got the cheese crisp and bounty burrito.. phenomenal! Even the nachos were killer.. if you had no idea you were dining area a vegan restaurant, you'd have no idea they were 100% animal product free. And their desserts are just like the real thing.. the lemon cheesecake and peanut butter cups are awesome! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Delicious salads.  I find it can be disappointing for gluten free eaters like me. They really need gluten free buns and bread and wraps. Health conscious people are eating gf more and more. I love the salads. They need more gf options for their foods. Great place. Beverages are amazing. I would also like to know what is and what is not organic."}
{"text":"My belly, heart and brain are happier after eating here. This place is the equivalent or the slightly better half of cafe gratitude in California.  We went for breakfast and was so pleasantly surprised with how good the food and service were. Our waitress was absolutely darling and made our single order pancake look and taste as good as the full order. We left feeling full with good healthy ingredients and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best vegan restaurants I've ever been to. The nachos are the best vegan nachos I've ever had, so tasty! Can't wait to go back soon."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! We locked our plates clean!! If you have non vegan friends bring them here and they'll fall in love."}
{"text":"Pretty good location...wide open spaces...great staff...wonderful outdoor seating...this describes the NEWEST Pomegranate Cafe location in Phoenix. The desserts look divine but I can't tell you much about the other food at this point. The wife and I plan to go there for dinner in the very near future at which time I will update this review. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my, Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here it's a consistent experience. Friendly staff, great menu and selection, and I'm never disappointed. One of the best vegan places I've eaten in the area."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Price and Wait Time not so.    For 2, expect to spend over $50 for lunch.   And if you go for lunch, you will need 90 minutes, cause it really takes a while to get your food, even your 'smoothie' is gonna take some time.  Not sure why they are so slow...been to plenty of vegan restaurants and just don't see wait times like this.  Good food, but not good enough to go back when there are other Vegan options available that are quicker and cheaper."}
{"text":"My 7 year old and I checked this place out last weekend.  I understand this is a new location, so I will forgive some of the service faux pas. I enjoyed the mushroom tacos and give kudos to the kitchen for making them even though I ordered them at a time they weren't available. Careful of the color coding system on the menu if you go. I didn't find the place to be kid friendly menu-wise though. My kiddos mac and cheese had some odd seasoning or spice and after one bite she wouldn't touch it.  I ordered something else and let the server know that she did not like the mac.  The French toast was nominally better. I understand that vegan french toast is likely very challenging, so again, forgiveness.  The wild and green drink (I think that's what it was called) sounded delicious.  Unfortunately that didn't translate to the glass.  I like spicy and sweet flavors together so the pineapple jalapeno combo sounded appealing, but when it arrived (after our entrees) it was so intensely jalapeno the none of the other flavors were discernable.  I struggled to consume it as I was reluctant to walk away from a $9 drink.  I was dismayed when the bill arrived and I discovered that the mac and cheese had not been removed even though it was barely touched.  Nor was my beverage, despite it's late arrival.  I work in hospitality and have for 25 years.  This is not the norm in my industry.  We spent $50 and really only enjoyed one item.  I think I'll stick to flower child from now on."}
{"text":"I would give service 2-3 stars but everything else gets 4. I think this issue could be solved with just hiring more people, which it looks like they're trying to do anyways. Went here for lunch on Saturday and got seated pretty quickly outside, but the place was pretty packed! Service was extremely slow. Took them a long time to get one water out (room temp water with one cucumber slice). Then another like 10 minutes until the second water came out, room temperature but no cucumber. We didn't request cucumber or no cucumber so idk why. A group of 6 sat down near us a while after we were seated, they had their orders taken first for some reason. Finally our order was taken, we got 2 superfood got cocoas and a falafel con papas with tofu. They first brought out the hot cocoas, and one of them was spilled all over the cup, we had to ask for a napkin to clean up, they didn't offer to help even though they were the ones who spilled it. It tasted good and was unique but didn't taste as good when it got cold. The falafel con papas tasted delicious but one of the halves was completely ripped down the side when it was served to me. I don't care that much about presentation, it just made it hard to eat. But I'd definitely order it again it tasted really good. Expensive, but worth it for once in a while. I'd come back maybe in a few months to see if their service improves."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I am not a vegan or vegetarian (I did have a little stint back in high school during my XXX hardcore days, but that's another  story). I enjoy eating meat. However, I do enjoy Vegan/vegetarian food as well which drew me to Pomegranate Cafe when I lived on the east side.   To be honest, Pomegranate Cafe is an acquired taste.  It's not for everyone as with most restaurants similar. The food is organic and non processed and most dishes I have tried has an \"earthy\" taste.  The juices are freshly made and is exactly that JUICE. No additives, sugars necessary.  You get the full nutrients from the food you're eating/drinking.   Whenever I come here (2-3 times/mo), I usually get the Lumberjack, hearty and delicious. I get it vegan even though a non vegan is available (when in Rome).  I also order the Abundance, a mean unpleasant looking green juice that is beyond delicious.  If I have room, as the portions are generous, I'll share dessert with friends.     As I've stated earlier, this place is not for everyone.  The prices are on the higher side, but for what you get, it's well worth it. Can you spend the same amount of money and get 25 cheeseburgers from McDonalds? Sure. If that's the case, then you have wasted your time reading this review. If you want a different culinary experience with healthy food, knowledgable staff, and relaxed ambiance, then give Pomegranate a try!"}
{"text":"I made the trip from Scottsdale all the way to here to finally try it out after obsessing over their facebook/instagram. Being a vegetarian, it is always so awesome to find an all vegetarian (or vegan) place, I only can think of a few others in the Phoenix area!  The cafe is really cute, near a trader joes which I think is a fitting location haha. Went at like 3pm on a Saturday and there was a pretty good crowd, I'm sure they get busy in there! I liked the decor and how the water was served in mason jars, pretty cute. It was so hard to decide what to order. Everything looked so amazing, totally my type of food! I ended up getting a burrito. I can't remember the name of it but it had a ton of veggies and was covered in red sauce. They used cashew cheese too which I love! The food was amazing and fresh and I nearly ate the whole burrito! Only downside: it was $15 for one burrito. I know it's all good quality ingredients and such but that seemed a little outrageous for me. Food was so good though Id come back. Id like to try something else on the menu too! Definitely a must-try for vegans and vegetarians, yummy!"}
{"text":"Good food but very pricey. Has some falafel dish with some unknown things in the plate..lol But was good. Not the price"}
{"text":"I sincerely wish there was a Pomegranate Cafe in Seattle.  I had a few hours to spend before heading to the airport and this was the best meal I could have ever wished for.    The cherry on top: jelly filled raw donut holes."}
{"text":"I didn't want to like this place, but the food was really good. I had the lumberjack sandwich. I was a little leary on the idea of the food when it came, but after tasting it my mind changed. I won't give up real meat or dairy, but I will try this place again."}
{"text":"Do I eat vegan food...sometimes. Do I eat processed animal product...you betcha. I always say if I could make vegetarian food / vegan food at home that taste as good as it does here maybe I'd give it a shot. I know how much organic produce costs so I'm not going to complain about the price, I just can't afford it for every meal and for those of you that want to tell me how easy it is if you put in the effort...well, I'm lazy. Long story short, food was delicious, service was great, atmosphere was relaxing."}
{"text":"I didnt know this was a vegan restaurant but it turned out to be pretty good. They have cage free eggs and milk so its not totally vegan as they have vegetarian options . I chose the breakfast burrito with eggs. It was huge and chock full of veggies and good stuff. I left feeling full but not uncomfortable.  They have all kinds of healthy juices and smoothie options.  Definitely a good stop  for healthy breakfast or lunch options un Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Our meals were fresh, healthy, and delicious! The downside was a long wait for the meal... but yummy so worth the wait.   Our server was happy and attentive with water/orders et cetera.   The maca mocha was DELICIOUS and small for the price ($10!?)... but man, so good. I wish I had another one!  Weird it's in a strip mall, but once you're inside you forget that... especially because of the prices. Am I in Malibu? We spent $95 for brunch for 3 people (one app, 3 meals, 2 coffees)... I expect those prices in LA or NY, so that was a bit disappointing to find them in a strip mall off the freeway.   Portions are generous though. I took my leftovers home and discovered some SYSCO plastic cooked in with my tofu! Glad I saw it before I could take a bite, but does make me wonder what is going on in the back....   Either way, I'd come back! I'd comb through my food a little more carefully and savor my maca mocha a little more slowly."}
{"text":"Great start for the Grand Opening day at the new 7th Street Pomegranate Cafe location, nice patio seating and a beautiful bright open seating space inside. The food is looked delicious as it came out if the open kitchen. For this visit I only had the Rocky Road dessert bar and it was divine!"}
{"text":"I have heard rave reviews about the Chandler location so thought I'd check out this one, as it's closer to my house. I realize it's newly opened but I was so disappointed. The website menu doesn't specify that the menu shown is only for the Chandler location. This location has a much more limited menu. Disappointing.  There were four of us in our group. It took nearly an hour to get our food and it didn't seem all that busy. Here's what we had: - Nori roll - meh, just OK. Nothing special. - Nachos - came out with \"chicken\" instead of the walnut taco \"meat\" with no mention made or explanation as to why. The walnut taco meat was the main reason this dish was ordered. The chicken was really dry and tough. - Crispy chicken burrito - the chicken was the same dry tough chicken used in the nachos. Not what was expected when the description was \"crispy\" chicken. The rice was also under-cooked making the burrito inedible. - Pom burger - the burger was good but the tempeh bacon was burnt (like completely black on one side), so it was pulled off the sandwich.   Overall, the food under whelmed us all.   The staff was friendly enough, but we had to ask for water refills. This is just a personal annoyance.   All in all, not sure I'd return to this location. But I'll for sure give the other a go."}
{"text":"Charming Cafe.What I ordered was excellent.A bit pricey, but that is the price you pay for fresh,organic, healthy, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Delicious food but took a while to get someone to take our order and the hot food took quite a while to arrive. Great atmosphere and lovely outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! Fresh juices of all sorts, breakfast and lunch.  I went here for breakfast and ordered the Pina Colada Pancakes not knowing everything was vegan (which is a plus in my book). The pineapple compote was warm and not too sweet, dusted with coconut. I liked the food here so much I came back the next day for lunch and had a curried sweet potato/tempeh bacon and tofu sammy on GF bread with a carrot ginger juice. YUM!  Next time I'll be in to sample some of the raw vegan brownie/powerbar/ball/tirimisu/cheesecake desserts!  I would eat here everyday, but I think this ma + daughter place will burn a hole in my pocketbook! It's a little pricey, but it's so good it's worth it to put some real nutritious food in your body. A+"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan but I appreciate the variety of trendy diets that pomegranate caters to. I like going somewhere that I know is consistent and the food is healthy and delicious. The portions are bigger now than a year ago and I think suit the prices better. The desserts can be hit or miss but mostly hit and vegan pasties are a real treat to see so kudos on that. I like the casual atmosphere and the staff is always polite, knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Wow we normally love this place but tonight was terrible. We waited on our server for almost twenty min... food took 50 min to come to the table. When it did - only half our food came. Another five min later and almost all our food made it out. We water finished eating and said just box up the food we are still waiting on. Not sure if it was the kitchen or the server Summer but wow. That sucked. The food was still delicious but I'm writing this negative review in hopes that some things can change because the service was just ridiculous. Half the tables were empty so they can't even blame being slammed. It was bad."}
{"text":"This is some of the best food I have had in Phoenix! I came here for a \"snack\" with a co worker while on business and was blown away by their buffalo cauliflower wrap that was vegan and gluten free. Our sever was awesome and the food was incredible!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I went in for lunch this week and really enjoyed this place. I started out with a Turmeric latte and it was enormous, delicious, and super warming. I had the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it far exceeded my expectations. The \"chicken\" in the bowl was Beyond Meat, which I love and the veggies were roasted to perfection. The real heros in this dish are the toasted pecans and the Thai sauce - both are huge flavors but neither overtaking the dish. It's just really nicely balanced and of course super healthy. My husband had the everything bagel and it was just way too much food to eat. The bagel itself was more like a bagel chip but dense, so when you bit into it, it didn't break it just squooshed everything out of the sandwich. It was good just really messy and hard to eat. The salad that came with it was a meal all by itself. So overall the food was pretty darn delicious. The server that waited on us was really nice and super knowledgable but not very attentive given that they weren't busy. We'll go back and eat here anytime we're in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food!  So hard to find a good, organic restaurant so it's nice to find one that actually makes great food!  Great variety, friendly staff.....little pricey but that's what you expect nowadays when organic is concerned.  Until the rest of the world catches up, prices will always be high for food such as this....quality;)"}
{"text":"I tried the dragon roll + potato wedges and both were amazing! Super fresh and definetly worth the price. Plus the entire staff was friendly and helpful. The juices and smoothie bowls also looked amazing."}
{"text":"Food is always good but the wait takes so long...  don't go if you are in a hurry to get somewhere. Must try the Brazil nut brownie or chocolate chip cookie dough brownie for dessert. Heavenly!!!!"}
{"text":"I've to this cafe a couple times. Their food and drinks are yummy.  I had sesame burger and my son had the teriyaki chicken.  It was a little too different for him but it didn't stop me from finishing it for him.  I would have liked a few more choices of dishes with meat but I suppose that would defeat the whole vegan cafe idea."}
{"text":"Expensively delicious!  The food is absolutely delicious for vegetarian style.  You need to be rich to be able to afford to eat healthy.  Who knew vegetarian food could so good and so expensive."}
{"text":"Still miss you guys but having fun with my new life in WA."}
{"text":"Not settled on a rating I want to give because this place is inconsistent. First time we went, wait was over an hour to get food for a late lunch. They weren't that busy but didn't have enough cooks. We got desserts to go, which were really good. Second time ... service was slow and spotty, lunch was excellent, but we were there for 90 min cause they were SO SLOW!! Third time, I called in order ahead of time; Told them we'd eat there. When we arrived, food was packaged to go, but we grabbed a table anyways. Food (even though we ordered) one of the same meals) was definitely not as good & just not the same."}
{"text":"I really like this place and they have wonderful food.  I know organic, vegan will usually cost more, but the food here is just overpriced.  I will still come because there are limited options in the east valley, but I am going to start looking for new places that are priced fair.  The smoothies alone are twice what I expect to pay.  But the food really is excellent!"}
{"text":"Breakfast food is the best food. I order a tofu scramble burrito and my partner ordered the Ranchero skillet. I loved mine. I tried a few bites of the Ranchero skillet  and that was awesome, despite the super hard tortilla it came with. I enjoyed the earthy ambiance and love eating organic. I am curious to try this place out again. However, I am not sure how often I could realistically eat there based on the prices. Over $30 for 2 breakfast entrees, a lemonade, and an iced americano is a bit pricey.  Overall, my first time at Pomegranate Cafe was a delicious experience."}
{"text":"I have been talking about going to this place for months!! MONTHS.  And I finally got to go tonight, and was crazy disappointed by the desserts, food, and service.  The waitress was highly attentive to everyone but us (IT WAS NOT BUSY). She was chatting up other customers, took the order of another table who sat down after us, and never filled our waters. Quite often, she was standing idly.   She only asked us if our food was okay when it was obvious that we didn't think it was.  Now to the food...  We ordered the nachos (best part of the meal... but you can't really screw up nachos), buffalo cauliflower taco (too spicy, I'm Asian and eat a lot of spicy, but that was all spicy and no flavor), pumpkin fudge brownie (aight but boring), and a slice of pumpkin chocolate cheesecake (so bad, and it was their recommendation!!!).   After letting her know about the least pleasurable parts of our meal (buffalo cauliflower and cheesecake), she took it off our bill. So thank you! But then it took her another 15 minutes to get the check... because she just forgot. So no thanks!   Also it looks like some new waitress was shadowing her... terrible idea if the owners just want to perpetuate BAD service.  Instead of going here, please go to Trader Joe's next door, buy some groceries, and make better quality food @ a lower price AT HOME."}
{"text":"So, I am not a vegan, nor am I vegetarian, however, this place rocks my world! Super friendsly (and not overly cheesy) staff, BOMB food, fresh juice, smoothies, espresso and yes, even alcohol.   Raw food options that will blow your mind. The flavor profiles in their dishes are phenomenal. Whoever this chef is knows what's up!  Even if you're not into the whole vegetarian/raw/vegan lifestyle, you will be surprised at how good this place is.   I am currently pregnant and unable to have caffeine and I really miss and crave coffee. The always friendly staff is eager to recommend something new and on my last visit I was turned on to Jnantik. This is a Mayan superfood coffee substitute that actually tastes/smells similar to coffee! They mix it right in with their Pom milk (a blend of various nut and soy milks) and serve it as a latte. So not only did this satisfy my coffee craving, but it is packed with vitamins and minerals to give me a natural energy boost!"}
{"text":"We are so happy to have Pomegranate Cafe in Ahwatukee! Every dish is delicious! We especially like the juices! Servers are always knowledgeable and helpful when choosing items off the menu! It is so nice to sit out on the patio in good weather! A great restaurant to take out of town guests to! The owner is always happy to help with donations to our local schools! Great community restaurant!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! So so delicious I am craving it!! I gave it 4 stars because the service wasn't the greatest but it definitely won't keep me from going back."}
{"text":"Service, all stars. I had the spicy dragon bowl with tofu and kelp noodles ( pro tip: ask for sriracha if you like heat), and it was delish. I'll be back- likely tomorrow!  Not your average vegan restaurant ( i.e. Bland)"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great. Love the outdoor set up even in the AZ summer heat. The inside is adorable! The mango coconut muffin is great the toast I ordered is dry. The Milky Way drink also take dry and far too strong. The service overall is good. The sever I had seemed annoyed by me asking questions (this is my 1st time here). I will be back in hopes for a better experience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Fresh ingredients and a wide variety if options on the menu. For dessert we had the pomegranate chocolate cake and it was really good, but had too much frosting. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just went to their new location last week, and I loved it. My friend and I met there for breakfast. The decor was bright, casual, and welcoming. The employees were friendly and accommodating. The food was delicious and healthy. As a breakfast lover and a vegetarian, this was a nice find. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely thrilled this place opened a central location! The Gila Monster Nachos are to die for with in house walnut meat and dairy free cheese!  I would also recommend the root vegetables wedges and the crispy \"chicken \" burrito !  The service was a bit slow but they have only been open a week! I cant wait to come back to this vegan restaurant ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome what a wonderful birthday brunch. We got the nachos and they were so fantastic you wouldn't believe they are meat free. We also shared the elephant burrito and it was amazing the almond Thai sauce really hit the spot. The route wedges were delicious but definitely put us over the top portion sizes are good and feeling here. I had no problem with service and even got a piece of cake for my birthday."}
{"text":"I visited the new POM location with much anticipation as I've been a loyal visitor to the Ahwatukee original location.  The food was as good as always with a few caveats... we waited over 35 minutes with what looked like a very light crowd and after we received our food, my order was missing an ingredient. Also, much to my dismay and disappointment, the service did not compare, AT ALL.  A big disappointment and I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I've been in there often due to convenient location, but, I usually do not feel good physically after eating there.  I've ordered things with cheese, but, I'm very concerned that possibly I may have been getting dairy cheese instead of vegan cheese.  They say they are vegan AND vegetarian.  But, I realize if they are offering dairy cheese & eggs on their menu, I feel extremely uncomfortable with that.    As much as they write they are organic, using local companies, etc., the part that would make them appear ethical....the very fact that they offer dairy & egg products, makes them no different than any ordinary restaurant.  Dairy products are the cruelest industry out there - even more than ordinary meat, &, it's already been proven that even a small amount of dairy causes cancer.  I need to start going back to strictly vegan restaurants, even if they are farther from where I live.  I wish Pomegranate Cafe would just let go of the non-vegan foods.  If they are supposedly so knowledgeable about health, organic, etc., they need to catch up to the several vegan restaurants who are making spectacular tasting foods."}
{"text":"Preface-  I am not a vegan and my wife is preggers.... This place had us pretty apprehensive looking at the menu but we took a leap and tried the vegan hash and an Athena's wrap. Absolutely amazingly good. This is easily now in my favorite restaurant list. Everything we tried was delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best food I have had in a while, so good!  I had the BLT with veggie bacon and it was awesome and totally satisfying.  My son had the humus and veggies, which he loved.  My husband and mother in law had the vegie burger, which they did not rave about, but said that it was ok.  It is a very cheery interior and we saw some other families come in and dine as well (always good to find more child-friendly places).  This place is truly a gem, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The menu is not nearly descriptive enough. I ordered a chickpea Mediterranean salad expecting falafel on a bed of lettuce. What I got was curried chickpea cakes on swiss chard and kale...disgusting. Not to mention two salads and lemonade cost $46. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend at Pomegranate Café early evening on a Wednesday, the place was too packed but it was steady. Since it my birthday I had dinner plans coming up so I knew that I couldn't get anything big to eat, and I immediately regretted that!  Everything just looked delish and I wanted to try it all!  After checking out the dessert display, I picked out a Brazilian Brownie, I won't lie, I wasn't sure what to expect from this raw brownie, but I was not disappointed.  It wasn't the same texture as a normal brownie, but it wasn't bad either. The brownie tasted great, it was sweet, but not too sweet, the texture was similar to how coconut would be. I was not disappointed in it at all   Looking forward to my next trip back!"}
{"text":"The raw vegan tacos are absolutely amazing. They R made with walnuts and taco seasoning, which was surprisingly delicious. The menu items are diverse, exotic and healthy. The service was also exceptional. But I do think the young girls need to not have too much attitude and just do their jobs. Can't wait to try other food items. This cafe will be the first of my top five vegan friendly restaurants to regularly dine in."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian and Vegan Friendly**  Cute little café with indoor and outdoor seating. They update their menu seasonally! I happen to be in the area and caught the happy hour specials. Happy Hour includes food and drinks.   Happy Hour Portions: Raw Tacos Vivos and Falafel Slider Both items are one serving each, and a great way to taste their menu. The Tacos Vivos has every taco topping you could possibly think of, it was fantastic. And they don't skimp on the guacamole! The falafel slider is served on their house bread, and it was a little dry for me, but the actual falafel was tasty.    Entrée: Curried Sweet Potato Quesadilla This was a seasonal item, and it was far better than I was expecting. The sweet potatoes with the tamarind salsa was a flavorful combination that brought the dish together. They have house hot sauces if you need an extra kick.    This place is very popular for juices and coffees. I didn't get any but I would return for a fresh smoothie. They have a very extensive brunch menu and I would love to come back to try this. Overall, I would recommend this to a friend.   PS: If you sign up to receive text message alerts, you can get a free cowgirl cookie (it was delicious) or an iced tea."}
{"text":"My favorite healthy restaurant! The food here is unbelievably tasty! So much so that you won't even miss the meat! I admire their commitment to local, organic produce and the love that goes into making and serving every healthful meal, dessert or juice/smoothie! I'm a regular here now, and have visited countless times with never a bad experience. My only complaint is that they are becoming so popular, that it is more and more difficult to find seating on the weekends. They are a tad on the expensive side, but until more people start demanding organic food, the price for organics will remain inflated. A cost the business bears and must pass onto the consumer."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Gets very busy during lunch, and the wait for your food is long, but so worth it!  I had a green smoothie which was great, and the raw tacos.  OMG.....sooooo good!  I can't believe something raw could be so good!  I wish it was closer to my house.  There are a dozen more menu items I'm dying to try!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegan.  I am not a vegetarian.  But man, oh man, if I could eat here every day I just might be.  I don't care if you go meatless or not, the food here is on point.  It's also great to eat something tantalizing to your taste buds and also not feel like a fatty patty when you leave.  Everything tastes impeccable and wonderfully fresh.  Don't forget to hit up the dessert case before you leave!  I'll be a customer for life."}
{"text":"Oh my. I can't believe I have been living in Awhatukee and didn't give this place a second chance earlier.  When this place first opened, my husband and I were stoked as our whole family is vegan. Unfortunately, back then the portions were tiny (my husband was still hungry when we left), the service slow, and the flavor was not memorable.  Today, after several YEARS (yes, years) we tried it again. Oh. My. Gawd. We ordered two of the raw dishes: the raw tacos and the Arizona roll. The tacos were INCREDIBLE. Spicy, great texture, and filling. The Arizona roll was just as filling and flavorable. I've been on a raw kick for almost a month, and I haven't felt as satisfied with a raw meal as I did today.  We spolied ourselves by getting the raw \"snickers\" bar and lemon bar. The snickers bar was absolutely heavenly. It was definitely enough for two people to share. The lemon bar was not as great, but had I not already tasted the snickers I probably would have thought it was bliss.  Needless to say, we feel guilty about not having given Pomegranate a second chance earlier. We were missing out. I can't wait to go back for \"Raw Fridays\" and Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! I am not a vegetarian but my daughter is and I LOVED the food! I had the black bean burger with sweet potato fries and veggies with hummus. Crazy good! I also had the iced latte with nonfat milk sweetened with coconut sugar. I will definitely be back though not as often as I would like. A lunch for two as $36 yikes! The atmosphere is very comfortable bright and cheery. It was clean and smelled amazing and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Fresh, local, and amazing. A bit pricey, but I'm willing to pay more for high quality food."}
{"text":"FOOD is awesome!  If you love organic healthy eats, this is the place for you. It is a bit pricey but unfortunately, organic food costs more.   It is a bit of a hike if you are just visiting but well worth the visit.  LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I have now been to Pom Cafe maybe 4-5 times.  There are numerous interesting dishes on the menu, and most of the dishes are heaping with food, so the prices are not that bad.  The veggies are fresh and delicious, and I love the hummus.  I've also ordered some of the rice and tofu and was impressed, although it could have been a bit more spicy.  I've ordered the hummus with bagel that also comes with veggie chips - very filling and tasty.  I need to branch out and order more things the next times I visit.  One of my friends is picky and vegan, and she now frequents this place quite often.  I recently ordered a salad with kale, and whatever the dressing that was on the kale was the most delicious dressing I have tasted in a while!  I have also ordered a veggie wrap with the \"cheese\" made from nuts (I think).  It was deliciously flavorful and interesting. The flax crackers that came with it weren't really enough, maybe 25 kcal worth. I also have tried their sweet stuff, and the homemade granola bars and cheesecake bites are fresh and tasty.   The staff members are always friendly and happy to chat for a few minutes when picking up orders or trays.   There are a few things that could make the place even better.  If it's busy, be prepared to wait for a while for the food.  Sometimes the portions are big and then sometimes they are small. I was expecting a deliciously large veggie plate like last time (normal size plate) but instead got a cake-sized plate with maybe 1/2 cup veggies  and hummus.  Also, some items are pre-mixed, and peppers make me rather sick. I have to pick them out or order something else.  Sometimes, or often, things are forgotten in an order, so make sure to check before leaving.   Pomengranate has expanded the menu since my review in August or whenever, and they now have dinner. I noticed on Facebook that they have pet happy hour, which is cool for people who have dogs."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  Excellent food even for non vegans!  Everything I have tried has been so fresh and full of flavor!"}
{"text":"Intricacy, healthfulness and quality of the food couples with relaxed atmosphere and friendly service.  Wow!  Do the right thing and eat here often!"}
{"text":"I came here about a month ago because I heard their Cakes were amazing and was pleasantly surprised to find they were even better than expected. HOWEVER, I went back this week with my family to have them see what all the hype was about only to be met with extreme disappointment. The cakes were dry and the frosting was greasy. It's like the whole bakery had gone downhill. Not only that, but our food which we had ordered prior to getting desert took so long to get out to us and was also subpar.   I am so disappointed, especially since I was raving to my family members about how amazing this place was. I'm not sure if there was a change in kitchen staff or what is going on, but I will not be returning, and neither will my family.   Unfortunate."}
{"text":"Have been here 2 times. The food was ok just not my type of food.  The service was slow and the girl who helped my friend and I seemed like she did not want to be at work."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place! A place where you can indulge but not feel bad about what you just ate... You certainly don't have to sacrifice flavor, presentation or quantity, as each menu item offers plenty of each. Had breakfast at PC on a different day and the front counter was VERY SLOW, despite there being no customers ahead of me. Courteous employees to be sure, but slow. TIP: Arrive between 10 - 11 am for a late breakfast or an early lunch. FAVS: The Mediterranean Wrap and The Scones are TDF! Overall, the food is wonderful but the prices are high ($5 for a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice--where are we, Alaska???) and the service is slow."}
{"text":"Don't go on Sunday's. Overly crowded, staff and kitchen not efficient. Took 40minutes for food to come. Potato Salad had some paper/ plastic. Lady next to us had hair on her meal and had to return.   Usually pretty good but today wasn't their day."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and really expected more from this place. I had been wanting to try it for a year or so and convinced my guy friend to go in with me. When we came in it wasn't too crowded. We only had to wait a couple minutes for a table which was great, but after we got seated the service was horrible. We got in around 7:30 our waitress greeted us, got us our drinks and food. After that we didn't see her for forever. Everything was so hectic. We had different servers refilling our water checking in on us, everyone seemed to be doing 5 different jobs on top of their own main job which is completely unnecessary (one server to one table doing one job is what should have been happening). When our food came I wasn't too impressed, I got the macaroni pesto dish. The veggies were great but the pasta just lacked flavor. After we finished our food we waited about 15 for our waitress to come back to take our dessert order/ give us boxes. On top of that our desserts took so long to come out. I ordered the Brazilian Brownie which took another 10 minutes to get to me (which easily could have taken 2 minutes to be taken out from the front where the dessert counter is and placed on to a plate and given to me). My friend order a milkshake and that took almost 20 minutes for us to get! When it got to him he asked for it to go since we were already there so long. After waiting about 10 minutes to get the milkshake to go I had to go upfront to ask for it along with the check. My waitress was up there working the register and handed me the melted shake that had been sitting out for some time now. We got the milkshake and the check and got out as quickly as possible. It was literally 5 minutes till close when we left.  The food is extremely overly priced as well, if it was exceptionally well I would understand but it's mediocre. I know the food I all 100% organic, nonGMO, is really Eco- friendly and has quality ingredients, but the pricing is still way too expensive. With two plates and two desserts it would have came to $ 46.00 ( $52.00 with tip) but our waitress took off the milkshake given it was so melted.  The business NEEDS to work on organization. I would suggest having a set group of people working the register (pick up orders, desserts, & making stuff for the people who come into pick up smoothies, drinks ect.) so the servers don't have to do all this stuff as well. I've worked in the restaurant business before so I understand a place being busy and lacking a 5 star service but this place wasn't that busy. They had 3-4 servers covering maybe a total of 8-10 tables. Where I worked 1 server would take on 6 tables at a time and still give the best service you could get. The servers and workers could easily give great service but it's so unorganized and the servers don't seem motivated to get things done.  I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We used to go to the Ahwatukee location regularly until the food went downhill. Today we tried the new location. Couldn't tell you about the food though because, after waiting 25 minutes, we left. There were 3 servers, 12 employees I could see, and only about 15 people in the restaurant so no excuse for the lack of service. It's a shame because my kids and I really used to love Pomegranate. The Ahwatukee location always had service issues but the food used to be worth the wait. Then the food wasn't good either. I had hoped it was because the owners were focused on the new location. But, the new location has all sorts of issues too. Not sure why the owners can't get employees who are attentive and fast. I saw lots of employees standing around and nobody paying attention to the few customers who were there. It's a recipe for disaster."}
{"text":"Sadly, this place has gone downhill fast. This was our favorite vegan restaurant in the valley. We would make the long drive from Scottsdale weekly. After the last three disappointing visits, we won't be back. Today the pancakes were served cold, burnt and tasting like cardboard - twice! We sent them back and they came back just as bad. The cinnamon roll was like a biscuit with frosting, not at all like a cinnamon roll. Last time we went we were served \"peppermint mocha\" that was coffee with a ton of mint syrup - totally undrinkable. The happy hour has reduced portions and the burgers are not nearly as good as they were. I use to crave the mushroom burger but not any more. Really sad to see this happen. Used to be a fantastic place and now it's awful."}
{"text":"Omg I have become obsessed! 1st meal was delicious so excited to have found a new spot I can eat and not think about how to tailor the menu items! Genius and absolutely thankful for this place when I don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood cafe that many friends have raved about. I finally ate here, and it was horrible. They mixed up our orders, served us sub-par food, and charged us over $45 for 2 salads and 2 ice teas. The worst part was that I got sick from the salad. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"Really good! Cool staff, huge menu, well prepared and thought out.   Really a delight :-)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! As I entered the Cafe, my senses didn't know what to do first. The smell of the food was enticing. The greeting by the gentleman was genuinely comfortable. Once seated we got our waters quickly and they were infused with cucumber.  I had the Green Garden Bowl for breakfast.  The food was delicious! If I lived on that side of town, I would be their best customer. I love that things were organic and some were vegan. What an interesting and unique place. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"My favorite! Their coffee, mimosas and root vegetable fries were really good! Being that I was avoiding all dairy while nursing my daughter, it was great peace of mind knowing this place is strictly vegan unless you ask for eggs or otherwise."}
{"text":"I am so glad that Pomegranate has graced Ahwatukee with it's AMAZING vegan and vegetarian fare. Thank you for bringing this type of cuisine to the masses and showing people that GREAT food can be made without using animal ingredients. XOXOXO"}
{"text":"Pomegranate is my favorite restaurant; everything is fresh, healthy, and delicious. I love the Rainbow Roll and the Collard Green Wrap the best, but everything I've eaten there has been amazing. I guess it's pricier than other places you can go, but that's because of the quality of what you're eating. For anyone attempting to follow a plant-based, detoxifying diet, this place is a dream! And don't get me started on their phenomenal vegan desserts, which are out of this world. I'm drooling just thinking about their Cheesecake Bites. I love you, Pomegranate!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second visit. We had the tacos vivas and the nachos. Both were fantastic!! For someone who is just learning about the vegan culture and is a diehard meat eater, Pomegranate Cafe has become one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in the Valley!!!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to have a reason to be in the east valley just to try this place. I wanted nothing more than to be able to have an awesome lunch and write a great review. Unfortunately that's not gonna happen. We were sat right away, server came right over, super sweet and friendly, got our drink orders (my husband and I ordered two different iced teas, which they brought out with both flavors mixed in one glass? Typing that makes me laugh)  Ok whatever, no big. We order food and wait. And wait. And wait. ALMOST FORTY FIVE MINUTES FROM ORDER TO TABLE! Then. My order came out wrong. The one thing I was most excited to try, the TLT, wasn't even brought out and I had to ask for it. Oh btw ask me how many times our teas (once put in delegate glasses were refilled in the hour and a half we were there. The answer is zero) Now we're rushing and order a dessert to go, our server took like $3.00 off the $65.00 bill. Um cool thanks.  In the midst of this, I'm watching the manager (I think?) go around checking on other tables, not once did she come by our table during the ridiculous wait or after just to be like hey sorry about that.  The food was good. Didn't love the root veggies. But the sliders were yum and my kiddo loooooved the French toast. But honestly by the time it got there, we were so rushed it's not like I could enjoy it no matter how great it was."}
{"text":"It would have gotten 5 stars if I didn't get a stomach ache from the food! :( other than that the restaurant itself was a very nice atmosphere, felt welcoming and the decor was nice! They also had a little farmers market inside which I thought was very cool!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots. The decor is hippy meets farm house, with lots of bright colors. It's very cute and girly! The menu is organic and vegan. But they will add eggs and cheese to some dishes upon request, making them vegetarian. My go to breakfast order is the wild western breakfast tacos, which I order with eggs and cheese (vegetarian but not vegan). Some of their portions are on the smaller size, but the breakfast tacos are actually huge and I never leave hungry when I order them. It's pricy when you consider there is no meat being served, but I figure the organic, locally sourced ingredients cause the higher price point. I have never been here for lunch/dinner; I'm going to need to try it out one of these days!"}
{"text":"I'm a total meat lover so even though I own a condo across  the way I have always avoided eating here. My daughter finally convinced me today to try it out and I have to say it was absolutely delicious! Will definitely be making this one of my favorite places!!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this cafe, but we have been sitting here for 20 minutes waiting for our order. The waitperson finally came and told me that I can't have what I ordered. Now we have to wait another 20 minutes. It's not that busy. Why does does it take forever to get our order?  We have to be somewhere in a half hour. I guess we're going to have to get it to go. Don't come here unless you have all day to waste."}
{"text":"As someone with lots of dietary restrictions (I mostly eat AIP), it's nice to know there is a place that you can safely eat! And the food is great! Service is warm, friendly and prompt. I stopped in for coffee and desert tonight. They use coffee from Peixoto which is one of my favs in Chandler. The only downside here is that it is pricey. But, I'm willing to pay for the quality and catering to all my special diet restrictions. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is a joke. I used Postmates for the first time and  have wanted to try this place for awhile. I ordered 2 things, the buffalo cauliflower and pom burger. Where should we start. Everything was completely squishy. The fries, burger itself was like baby food, the lettuce,  the tiny thin sliced of tomato. The  bread wasn't though, it was dry and crumbling to bits. The onion was the butt so it was just the hard tiny rings left over. The cauliflower was limp and when I picked it up it just flopped over. There were 3 small cherry tomatoes as garnish and one was even rotten with a big black spot on it! I paid 38$ for this crap? It must have been sitting under a heat lamp for hours or this is just how it is I don't know but Never never again."}
{"text":"Beautiful people, beautiful food! This place is very unique with its menu and everything is delicious!!! Don't go home without dessert, there is always something different and absolutely divine! There's a book share outside to read, or let your kids read while dining! The Happy Hour menu has a wonderful selection (raw tacos and \"wings\") are a great choice! I always have a hard time picking, as all options are great!"}
{"text":"I love Pomegranate!  What can I say, if you are looking for the healthiest dinning experience, go here!"}
{"text":"We discovered this place through everyone's Yelp reviews and they were right - this place is simply AMAZING!  I wish I could come here more often but it seems to be our before Ikea stop to fill up before we battle those awful crowds.  Please expand your reach and open a place in north Phoenix so we can enjoy your food more often!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3-stars because the food is actually really good. One thing I didn't like was the customer service and how everything was run. We went yesterday around noon, so I was expecting it to be busy. Every sit was full except for the bar so we went to sit there and basically was ignored. If, we didn't flag anyone down, I'm pretty sure we weren't ever going to be helped by anyone. When we finally flagged someone down and ordered, we waiting about 20 minutes for the food which wasn't bad timing. I am a little surprised on how expensive it was, hence for another -1 star. For 2 bowls and water, my bill came to about 30 bucks. Yikes. I could've went to Panda that was down the street and have leftovers.   Besides the expensiveness and the bad customer service, the food tasted really good and the portion wasn't too bad (although, for paying 30 bucks for 2 plates, I expected bigger portion of food). Other than that, here have 3 stars on me."}
{"text":"I only had a few minutes to get something for lunch but when I got there it was packed. I got there about after 12 lunch. Even though the wait was long I ordered a strawberry smoothie. The staff were awesome to everyone waiting in line. The smoothie was really good too. Next time I'll have to order one of their avocado sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place to eat! The food is absolutely delicious with a wide variety of cuisine to choose from.   The staff are friendly, courteous, and very helpful especially in making food recommendations.   My only complaint is that I don't live close enough to eat there more often!! Please come to the East side!!"}
{"text":"Update: I had a vegan friend visiting from out of town and found out it's really freakin hard to find a place to eat that isn't just bread, water and salad!! So bless this place for keeping my friendship with my vegan friend together! They have such a creative and extensive menu of vegetarian and vegan options that keeps both meat eaters and non happy and full. The prices are a bit steep for lunch but you pay for what you get: truly organic and fresh ingredients made to order. Service is always stellar and excellent and I'll always be coming back!  ----------  This little cafe serves up some excellent vegan food for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians...but definitely at a price. I've come here on a few occasions, usually for brunch also some lunch here and there. Everything on the menu is vegetarian/vegan so you don't have to look twice if you're vegetarian. Everything I've had has been very flavorful enough to enjoy eating your guilty free, meatless dish. My favorites have been the supreme burrito which hides the vegetarian part of it very well, and the dragon bowl. I think the entrees here are moderately priced about $15 for larger portions, however their acai bowls and juices are incredibly pricey. $13 acai bowls and $10 juice is ridiculous but that's the price you pay for all organic ingredients. Overall they make healthy and vegan food very tolerable if you can also tolerate a little hipster vibe. Love taking my out of town vegetarian friends here for brunch."}
{"text":"I had an issue with the service but Cassie made it right. Most business owners make very little effort to make things right, but Cassie went above and beyond.  That says a lot."}
{"text":"Great service. Great atmosphere. Great music. Great staff. Great food. Our server was Terry and he was awesome! If you happen to get him you will see. On top of everything, quick, and friendly. Try all of their desserts, they are quite exquisite. I had the buffalo cauliflower which had a spicy kick and the ranch dip was amazing. Next, I ordered the Avocado sandwich. The bread was fantastically toasted yet still soft. Make sure you try POM cafe and request Terry as a server. Your day will be a lot better!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I cook plant based at home and was skeptical at first on quality. Most vegan places used processed \"meat\" substitutes. I was so impressed with how fresh everything was. We went at happy hour. Started with the chickpea slider and buffalo cauliflower slider (the latter had a kick!). I got the mermaid salad and my husband got the burrito with enchilada sauce all over it. We were both impressed and will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"This place makes my top 3 restaurants of all time list. A friend took me here while I was visiting from Texas and OMG it is so amazing. I got the green goddess burger. Talk about mouthwatering delicious!  I desperately wish they had a location in austin Texas whet I live as, this place blows all the vegan options there out if the water by far. Or maybe if they had a cookbook!   The owner even gave us a pomegranate chocolate cake ball and another dessert when we were wit to leave just so we could try them. The pomegranate cake ball was one of the best desserts I've ever had (I'm including all non-vegan desserts in this comparison as well).  Get the kale salad too. It's amazing,  and the dressing they make in-house is sooo tasty!  I'm a little embarrassed to admit it,  but this place is so good,  I went back the next night before my flight flew out and got the same dinner to go. Yes,  It's that good."}
{"text":"Awesome spot, amazingly deep menu!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time and was pleased to know that everything is organic and vegan unless you choose to add dairy or eggs to the meal.   I ordered the Smokey Tempeh B.L. T. (see pics)   First of all the portion was HUGE! Generous helping of Exotic Veggie Chips and a side salad along with a sprinkling of cherries Plus this Amazing Sandwich. I do mean it was AAAMMAZIIIING!!  Seriously, the Tempeh Bacon was practically like tender BBQ Beef Brisket, it was quite a magical moment for my taste buds.   My salad came with a side of Living Caesar dressing, which is all raw vegan ingredients, it was a little spicy for my taste so I asked for the Pomegranate vinaigrette, YUM! Sweet, Tangy and a little zing from some fresh mint it was much more to my liking.   I'm just ecstatic that there is something so Veganly Delicious ( it's my review so I will make up words if I want to)) so close to home.   4 stars for now, until I try more items, but that sandwich was so 5 stars!"}
{"text":"All about the biscuits, and gravy here.  And the POM truffle.  Tried the Quiche, and personally it was bland, and I didn't enjoy the aftertaste of what seemed to be cashew.  I am not a fan of cashews or cashew based sauces, which may be part of the reason I didn't enjoy the quiche.  But the biscuits and gravy are so good I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Love the biscuits, and gravy here.   The dish comes with a veggie hash that has seasonal vegetables.  It is hearty.  Recently, I tried the quiche, and wasn't a huge fan.  It was lacking any flavor to me.    But, i'll keep trying new menu items.  Cant like everything all the time, right?  This is a great Vegan friendly brunch spot!  My favorite dessert here is the POM truffle.  It is a decadent chocolate treat."}
{"text":"First off, the food is amazing. Been coming for quite some time. I was bothered by an employee who treated a non-Caucasian woman and her children like second class humans. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite little places to eat! Everything I've tried has been amazing and the food portions are pretty big.     The only downside is the price. A smoothie starts at $9. It makes eating here (for me) a rare treat.      I love that local produce and fresh ingredients are used.     My weakness is their raw desserts! You must try the raw cheesecake or tiramisu. My go-to for an entrée is their Elephant Curry Bowl with tofu."}
{"text":"This is the new location. Boy, I appreciate having it in Central Phoenix. The food is pricier than other vegan joints but it's very, very, very fresh and that's worth it."}
{"text":"Having food allergies I love that I am not limited on what I can and cannot enjoy here.  I love everything I have tried from nachos, tacos, buffalo cauliflower with yummy vegan ranch to their awsome breakfasts and gluten free desserts. Staff is always super nice, and Happy to answer any questions. I prefer visiting for their breakfasts, always start the day feeling great."}
{"text":"This place transformed our life!  We are vegetarian, but wanted to give the raw thing a try.  I was very impressed with the creative, delicious meals and desserts!  My kids were even impressed.  The dishes are a little pricey, but I am willing to pay because I know that a lot of effort, time and quality ingredients go into making this type of food.  I love the food, the atmosphere and the nice people that work there.  I will always try to work in a visit here when I come to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Ok, service aside the food is great. I had the chai latte and soup (clamless chowder) & half salad (mermaid). Server was super knowledgeable about the menu and the vibe here is good. Prices might come off a tiny bit high but its super clean eating and I had so much food/bev that I couldn't finish.   It might be because I was eating a \"quick bite\" alone but service was nonexistent. I sat a long time waiting to order, to get my order, and to pay (no extra stops made by anyone... In fact the hostess saw my card out and closed my check). I was here for about an hour (not so quick) plus the \"5min\" wait that was more like 10-15. Again no big deal but something to keep in mind. Oh and its not that busy. There's a steady flow of people.   Overall I liked this place, could probably get my bf to try it, but I wish the service matched the ambience and the food."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe! Wonderful for my friend who eats paleo! I got the egg scramble with seasonal veggies and it was incredible! Definitely coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at pomegranate cafe yesterday. The prices are high but it is worth it for what you are getting. Everything is vegan unless you specify you want dairy cheese or eggs on something. Yesterday I found out they even have cocktails! Two of us got the screwdriver with tangerine sorbet and it was so tasty! It was honestly the perfect summer treat. Another friend got the lavender sour and that was great too! As far as food goes, we all split the vegan spinach artichoke dip. I was skeptical because I like my spinach artichoke dip and I LOVE cheese. it was SO creamy and delicious! It tasted like the real thing and I was honestly blown away. It came with corn chips and this AMAZING bread that I haven't had there before. It was literally so. good. I have tried their Arizona roll a million times and it is a delicious alternative to sushi. I used to get the cauliflower buffalo quesadilla and I was sad to see they took it off the menu, our wonderful server said they could make me one anyway! Overall we had a great time with delicious food. The price is the only thing I wish I could change. I understand because it is all organic, local and vegan though. With 2 drinks each, one meal and splitting the appetizer 3 ways it was about $44 each. Regardless I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food prepared by Marlene and Cassie of Pomegranate Cafe is FANTASTIC. I had the opportunity to attend a retreat that they came to be the chefs for. Everything they set out -- breakfast, lunch, and dinner -- tasted fresh and delicious. From the handmade granola accompanied with fresh-cut fruit, to the vegetarian spring rolls + peanut sauce, to the veggie burgers, to the apple + berry crisp, to the veggie penne + pesto. I know this is not a review about the cafe itself, but I am here to say that anything produced by these two ladies will nourish you, mind and body. If I ever get the chance to come out to the Phoenix, AZ area, Pomegranate Cafe will be on my itinerary for sure."}
{"text":"Yummy, healthy, nutritious! I've been coming here for several months for my fix of coffee, smoothie, and green goddess burger naked style. Their sauces are so delicious. I cannot imagine how they make them without dairy! Very friendly service too."}
{"text":"First time here with my family,we waited 45 minutes for our meal and it wasn't even that super busy. When the food arrived it looked like they just threw it on the plates without care;plated horribly,the hash from the Pom Plater were still raw,the coco whip was so watering it looked like a puddle of water and my daughter never got hers ,after the waitress told us she'll be back with it. My wife sandwich was cold,it was a Avocado Sandwich, the bread hard as a rock with 4 mini slices of green apple and a dirty plate,like no care to show pride on plating food. They told us ,after complaining,that we had a free dessert for the long wait and of course it never came. Super expensive and so not worth it. 2hrs of my life I'll never get back"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. I got the Strawberry French toast I think. Delicious. They have lots of GF and Vegan friendly things too! Its right beside Trader Joes."}
{"text":"REALLY expensive but honest food. I really have to budget in order to eat here, but often times just their drinks are good enough. I will say that although they are delicious the food left me in a funk that had me running to the bathroom (I walked there mind you). Either the wrap wasn't gluten free, or I just needed a major cleanse."}
{"text":"I must not be healthy or hip enough to appreciate this cuisine. I've gone with friends a few times (the last couple under protest). Smoothies are good (who can't make a decent smoothie?) but the food is bland and unsatisfying to my taste. I also believe it's seriously over-priced. The last time I was there my friend had a smoothie and I had a \"bagel sandwich\" (tasted like plywood) with a side salad and water. With tip it was $38. Seriously? Did I mention that you can take home a loaf of GF bread for $17? The servers are nice and the atmosphere is pleasant but I'm clearly not the client they are seeking. There are many places to get a healthy meal without sacrificing taste and going into debt."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan but the food was actually amazingly good. The reason this review is 2 stars is because... I saw 2 cockroaches climbing the walls. I haven't been back since. Such a shame because I have some vegan friends who love this place but I just can't bring myself to go back there. Ugh."}
{"text":"Great place for vegans! So many options, though a bit pricey, are very filling and delicious! We got the biscuits and gravy, and the chilaquiles, both with tofu and some leftovers for later. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the service wasn't the best...we weren't checked on - so we didn't get water refills (sitting outside in Arizona), we didn't order drinks or desserts because by the time he came back, we didn't feel like waiting any longer. I watched the two tables next to us get waited on hand and foot by their server! She was coming back and forth so much! We spent an hour there and i can confidently say 20 minutes of that at the least, was sitting and waiting for our waiter to come back and let us box up our food and leave. Some more water would've been nice too. Oh and the smoothie and juice we wanted but didn't get because it would've been another 20 minutes waiting for our server, who's name was Danny."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love (mostly) vegan places. The default is vegan and you have to request to substitute for vegetarian items. Absolutely delicious food and drinks, friendly staff, cool patio."}
{"text":"Pomegranate cafe is amazing for people with allergies! They are extra careful, especially if you mention specific allergies. There is nothing on the menu that I have tried and didn't like -- each dish is creative and unique, but packed with flavor. Staff is polite and the owner is a total sweetheart. I've been going here for over 3 years now and won't stop any time soon. My only critique is that service can sometimes take a while, so just set aside some time for a leisurely meal and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"This is just a great restaurant - great staff, and the food is fantastic. Go there, you will have a great experience. Try the daily special, it is always good."}
{"text":"Service seems to be lacking pretty frequently at the  Ahwatukee location. It takes a long time to even get water and I have seen servers sitting by the computers playing on their phones while I wait to get the check. Food wise, I've had some really great things and some really bad things here. My friend got their \"sushi\" roll, which was surprisingly delicious. I also enjoyed their raw everything bagel, rocky road bar, and raw brownie. Some of the other desserts, however, were inedible. The chocolate peanut butter cupcake was so dry, I couldn't get a piece to stay on the fork. My husband had a blueberry \"cheese\"cake that had an off putting color and flavor. Neither of us took more than one bite. I do love their POM house milk, however. It went very well with their local coffee. I also would like to see them drop eggs and cheese off their menu. They really brand themselves as being vegan, I wish they would take the leap and get cruelty off their menu when they are already so close!"}
{"text":"I love pomegranate seeds so why would Pomegranate Cafe be any different?   This little mix matched spot is adorable, it's what my Pinterest boards dream to look like. Wooden tables, chairs with fresh words on them, mason jars EVERYWHERE and all fresh ingredients to boot.     I've had a sun warrior smoothie and the Raw! Tacos which were to die for. The walnut meat was spicy and delicious wrapped up in cabbage leaves. I'm hooked on their food pairings and the vibe they give off.   P. S. Their dessert selection is to die for. Lemon bars? Gluten free goodness."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Unapologetically plant based, you can get everything vegan and most things gluten free. They are also super aware of allergies and make sure to inform you of all possible sources of cross contamination. But the food here is amazing! I have never been disappointed with a trip to Pom. The meals are pricey but worth it for their flavor and portions. Just the other day I stopped by for breakfast and was treated to a lovely seasonal chai latte and smoothie bowl. Yum!!"}
{"text":"This place is for vegetarian and anyone who want to eat healthy. I am the meat lover and I really think they do not make the food tasty. My wife loves it but I dont. But I go there often since I feel healthier whenever I eat their food. Their healthy juice is very healthy taste. The major downside is not the taste, it takes forever to make its food. This is casue they make it so fresh and healthy. If u r looking for delicious food, do not go here. But if u want healthy  food, this is the best place in town."}
{"text":"From the food to the atmosphere to the people who work here, every moment I have spent at Pomegranate has been Bliss. I wish they would open a location where I live, in Los Angeles. Last time I went I had the Bbq jackfruit Mac n Cheese, which is the best mac and cheese (vegan and wheat free) that I have ever had because not only is it delicious but it is a hearty portion size (unlike a lot of vegan places, Suncafe Organic, Rasa, I'm looking at you.) I also had a 'milk'shake that had caramel and jnantik (a mayan superfood that tastes like coffee) topped with cocowhip and that was a massive treat. (In LA we pride ourselves on being on the cutting edge and I don't know of anyplace here currently offering jnantik.) I took home a bunch of sweets and my favorite was the chocolate cake, though they were all great and I'm confident you cannot go wrong. I've been craving their fare since and look forward to the next time I visit my cousin in Tempe so I can come again. Can you ladies publish a cookbook please? Thanks in advance."}
{"text":"I doubt that I could add anything that everyone else hasn't already said.  The food is PHENOMENAL and the staff is kind and knowledgeable.  This place is run by people who have integrity and who truly care about the community.  It shows in the food and in the service.  Healthy, fun eating doesn't get much better than this.  I eat here almost every week."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new spot for vegan eats! Pomegranate cafe blew me away with their house made gluten free bread via their avocado toast! So many healthy options, that I cannot wait to be back. 5 out of 5!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The food never disappoints, but the service is absolute crap."}
{"text":"Best local produce food in town. Loved the avacado sandwich and the pomegranate pancake. Loved the feel of the cafe. Added to my favorites list."}
{"text":"Pomegranite Cafe is such an offering of love to our community  Everything is well thought out and offered with such care.  Pomegranite Cafe cares about our well being and for the planet   You could not possibly go wrong choosing anything from their menu In the winter I love the soups  Vegan chicken noodle with mock chicken Lentil soup The French toast and pancakes are unprecedented   I always feel good after I eat here  Great wholesome food Heavenly deserts"}
{"text":"We must be cursed with this restaurant. The food is amazing but the kitchen has no idea what the hell they are doing.   My family has been sitting here for almost two hours and we STILL don't have our food. The last time we tried to eat here they lost our order and t took over two hours to get our food.   Do NOT come here during any time where it's busy as you will literally be waiting for hours.   I wouldn't be so annoyed if we didn't order before every single table around us but they all are eating. But not us.   We just can't waste our time ever coming here agin unfortunately."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pomegranate Cafe. I'm so excited that they are open for dinner now. Perfect for a healthy Happy Hour. This place IS pricey, especially the juices, but they taste awesome. The owner is so sweet and they put so much thought into doing eating clean the RIGHT way! I am gluten, dairy and soy free and it so so cool to be able to have dessert! If I could afford it, I would go there everyday. Skip the crappy food at happy hour and come here instead, your body will thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour menu including miniature sliders that are delicious. I had the mushroom burger \"cheeseburger \" and the Tacos  Vevo's raw and they're all delicious this is the best vegan place around!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegetarian, or vegan, but I was charmed by this restaurant.  My omelet was delicious and I loved the lemon ice water pitchers. My vegan friends who were with me loved the place and go there often. I would go there again."}
{"text":"I am neither vegetarian nor vegan and my bf is a meat lover. We ate there today for brunch and the food was delicious, fresh, and the service was fast. I had the 'crab' eggs Benedict and my bf had the sunrise breakfast wrap. Both were so amazing and the portions were huge. We brought half of it home and I'm excited to be enjoying it again tomorrow. We also tried two desserts, the lemon bar and the rocky road bar. Omg heaven in our mouths!!!! Daniella and Justine were accommodating and genuinely friendly. We will definitely be coming back and I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys a well prepared, fresh and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I've been wanting to try this place but it's too far. So yesterday since I was in the area, I stopped by. I ordered their burger of the day, mushroom quinoa, and it came with root potato fries and a strawberry salad. The burger was great, I didn't care for the fries, and the salad was delicious but it only had lettuce and strawberries, the description said it also included avocado and candied pecans but mine didn't. I didn't notice until I finished. A bit pricier than I'd like for lunch but for fresh, local, vegetarian food I understand. I'd go back if I was nearby to try more items and sample their dessert."}
{"text":"One of my FAVE local places. Let me be clear that I'm a carnivore and I cannot imagine a life without meat. But this place rocks. Their food is so creative and flavorful that you won't miss the meat! I love heir breakfasts, but their other foods are great too!! My husband and I come here for breakfast as much as possible and he loves their smoothies!! Their baked goods rock too!!"}
{"text":"Great food options and amazing concept. But why does everyone insist on using crappy oils?"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant. What an incredible menu and such a kind place to eat. Options for veg/an and human kind in general. We are all gentler souls for having visited this brilliant establishment. Kudos to mother and daughter dream team. SO worth the drive to Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Was so excited to find this on Yelp and was even more excited when I got to the restaurant for dinner and found so many delicious looking options. After entirely too long, I decided to try the green goddess burger on gluten free bread with the root vegetable fries. Holy smokes! Best vegan sandwich that I've ever had! The fries were served with a homemade BBQ sauce which we bought a jar of.  We naturally tried some sweets after we ate. The cowgirl cookies were wonderful! The rocky road bar was a little too rich for my taste buds but my boyfriend devoured it.  Can't wait to go back and try some of the other entrees!"}
{"text":"I mean, it's probably the best $15 quesadilla you'll get in town.  If that's not your thing you can probably score a $14 salad.  But if you're really feeling froggy, try the $13 half soup and terrible sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!  We shared several dishes and all were delicious.  The employees are helpful, friendly & lovely too!  We were told the Owner tries to buy everything local, all is organic and fresh.We shared a  raw almond joy like bar for dessert & it was to die for!   Pomegranate iced tea was yummy too. So happy Ahwatukee has this wonderful, healthy delicious place to eat!  Ask for the punch card to get free drinks after purchasing a certain amount."}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch it's always so good and refreshing! The Rodrigo Rocket Fuel Smoothie is one of Amy favorites!"}
{"text":"I like the food, but the prices are very high.  Every meal comes with a HEALTHY dose of capitalism.  I just bought a 16oz smoothie.  Rocket fuel + Spirulina.  It was $17.20 with a $2 dollar tip.  Yikes...too much for me but they appear to be busy."}
{"text":"I am so happy to see a second location open! As other reviewers have noted, they're learning. They've messed up a couple take out orders (left off walnut meat on a bowl, made wrong salad), but they've caught mistakes and their customer service is excellent. Always check your orders before you leave! Definitely a new favorite spot for our family.  The menu here is smaller than the Ahwatukee location, but the quality of the food is great, the presentation is colorful and beautiful, and overall the food is just fantastic when compared to other restaurants (veg or not). We always order way more than we can eat.   They also have some of the best vegan desserts in the valley."}
{"text":"Chili, \"sushi\" rolls, pizza, kale salad, raw chocolate coconut bar.  All beautiful, creative, and yummy. Everything we have tried is good. This is one of our favorite weekend spots. It would be a favorite weekday spot too if it were closer. We love having so many vegan options on the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu and great flavors. We had the salads, burgers, and nori rolls, and deserts. Everything was great and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Tried the coconut caramel hot coffee which was delicious.  BUT, this review is for the desserts which is the only reason I went.  We had a chocolate-strawberry cinnamon roll that was really hard and flavorless, the brownie was also really hard and strong-like dark chocolate.  The cheesecake was decent but still flavorless, although it reminded of ice cream almost.  Totally a waste of $26 for the 4 items we purchased.  I should've spent that much on gas to travel to a different bakery (say, the one in PHX......).  So disappointed.  Maybe I should've gone for the food instead of the desserts and I might have had a different outcome, but at this point, I'm not going out of my way to try this place again."}
{"text":"Great place for vegan food... Nice exotic flavors. We ordered quinoa with soy meat and scrambled goodness :) very pricey for the quantity so a table for two with drinks will not be less than $45... Their exotic drinks are $6 -$12 ... Definite try for once but not sure if I can keep going there :)"}
{"text":"I was delightfully surprised with the Pomegranate Cafe.  I thought this was another coffee house, juice bar, but its so much more.  Organic, macrobiotic, gluten free vegetarian/vegan cuisine that tasted amazing.  I would have given it five stars for the Arizona Rolls alone, but my husband's chickenless caesar was just okay.  They are a tad expensive for a cafe lunch, but I will definitely return to try these tasty and healthy morsels."}
{"text":"The food is good, but if you're looking for a good dining experience, head elsewhere, at least for now.  I keep being excited about having Pomegranate Cafe in our neighborhood, but I certainly hope that in a few months they have things ironed out, the soft opening doesn't seem to have alleviated the glitches.  We came in and ordered hummus to start. Later, we ordered our entrees. We knew the food takes quite a bit to come out, but after enquiring about the hummus about 20 minutes later, we were told that \"it'll be out right away, they are just finishing making a new batch\". And then nothing happened. Eventually the manager came out with some soup (which we didn't order or were asked if we actually wanted to eat, which we didn't), and about 30 seconds later our food came out. We had Elephant Bowls, which are great. Keep in mind though that the sustainable silverware does not have points on the forks, so you have to shovel your food rather than pick it up and the knives don't actually cut anything, which is trouble for any sort of broccoli pieces larger than your mouth. Eventually we asked for the check, and looky here, the hummus was on it. The excuse \"Sorry, I don't know the computer system yet\". Really? If that were the case, the better option would have been to ask your manager rather than make us pay for it. Just be honest and say you forgot. In case you're curious, the hummus DID come out, after we had paid and were stuffed.  In short, great food, if it ever comes, don't expect good communication, bring your own silverware."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that my family isn't raw vegan, nor do we go out of our way to always eat vegan. However, we have sensitivities to dairy and gluten so restaurants like Pomegranate Cafe appeal to us because we always leave feeling great and never wake up the next day feeling sluggish or with a tummy ache. That being said, we have tried many vegan and vegetarian restaurants and Pomegranate Cafe offered a lot of unique and delicious options that we had never encountered!  Here's what we thought of everything we ordered! --Buffalo Chicken Wrap (with cauliflower option): VERY spicy but had good flavor! Definitely not even remotely similar to the tradition buffalo flavor so I was a bit disappointed, but overall it was filling and satisfying! I ordered the salad on the side and LOVED the sunflower ranch dressing. I wish i could have that on every salad!! --Lumberjack biscuits & gravy: The gravy was great for having no dairy in it, but the biscuits were a bit dry. Hash on the side seemed to have the same extremely spicy seasoning as the buffalo chicken wrap, but was still yummy! Farm scrambled eggs weren't really seasoned or fluffy. --Pancakes: Delicious! It's amazing that they're gluten free because they were so fluffy and had a completely normal pancake texture, whereas many gluten free pancakes are heavy and dense. We were so impressed! --Magic Dragon Bowl: Super yummy smoothie bowl, a bit heavy on the banana in my opinion, which masked most of the other flavors, but that's just nit-picking. Overall it was a delicious bowl!   Service could have been better (-1 Star). It took a while for us to be acknowledged after being seated and the server only came to refill our waters once or twice. But our server was friendly and upbeat when he did come to the table which is a huge plus! The prices are also fairly high compared to many other \"health-food\" restaurants, but we appreciate that they source their food from completely non-GMO and almost entirely (98%) organic farms and vendors so that wasn't as much a problem for us. We're willing to pay for that peace of mind.  We also tried a few desserts! The cookie dough brownie was great but SUPER rich! I could only tolerate a few bites, but it was so good! The cupcake we tried was a bit dry and crumbly, I probably wouldn't buy that again. The strawberry rosemary scone was incredible! It pairs perfectly with tea, it's a must-try!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  Read great reviews, and headed down for breakfast.  Nice location next to Trader Joes.  Noticed the menu only had 4 options for breakfast, and as I am a picky eater, only 1 appealed to me.  Guess the menu changes every week depending on what is fresh.  I ordered pankcakes, my fiance ordered breakfast tacos, we both got cappuccinos.  Sat at a rickety table next to dirty veggies in a loud deli case, and drank our espresso drinks, noticing they were HORRIBLE.  Tasted burnt.  Then the food was ready.  OOPS.  Only the tacos were ready, and I had to wait ofr pankcakes.  after a few minutes, I got my pancakes.  My fiance said his tacos were only ok, nothing special.  The pancakes were served with thawed frozen blueberries, odd for such a \"fresh\" oriented place, as well as COLD syrup.  No butter or even the OPTION of asking for butter.  They tasted like cardboard, no flavor at all.  Terrible.  After choking down 1 pancake, finishing my burnt cappuccino, we bussed our own table, not a problem, except the garbage was overflowing, and no one helped us.  We balanced our trash on the pile, and left.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"NOT JUST FOR VEGANS!!!!  This place is always consistently delicious. On this trip I went solo and picked up the tacos.  Great accompaniment of some sort of \"special sauce\" and a faux chicken that tasted like real chicken lol.    I also enjoyed a bottle of Kombucha from the price stock.   Very good and didn't have a strong after taste others have left for me.    What I really enjoy with this restaurant is the group of amazing staff.  They are high energy people who while being extremely friendly, are very efficient.   Thank you for another great experience!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I've been a Pom - goer for over 4 years starting at the other Ahwatukee location. I can't rave enough about the food. Being a vegan, it's utter heaven. And being mindful of consuming organic & local foods, it's double heaven! Love that this place considers things like sourcing sustainable bamboo silverware, has a super great RO & remineralizing water filtration system that's served for drinking water and is used for food preparation, and pays to have their food scraps composted. As if all this isn't enough, their deserts are bliss. Brownies, truffles, cakes, cupcakes and cheesecake.. to name a few. All vegan & mostly gluten free. Made with coconuts and nuts and dates and other real food ingredients. Yes please!!  Do yourself a favor and check this place out. It's a great addition to the area and you'll be happy you paid a visit :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place, the atmosphere, the breakfast food & especially the coffee.  We moved from Ahwatukee to Tempe but still try to make it over to Pomegranate as much as we can."}
{"text":"This is our favorite vegan restaurants in the greater Phoenix area. Cassie and her team take great care of their guests Serving up tasty food healthy food in the friendly environment"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but I love my veggies and people who are creative enough to be vegan/vegetarian. My friend and I had a reservation for lunch. Right on time our table was ready, our wait staff was knowledgeable and friendly, and we got great service given how packed it was around lunch. My only complaint was being forced to pick just one dish! Everything looked and tasted wonderful. I had a beet burger (a first for me and I LOVE beets). Most beets can be VERY earthy but this was a beautiful and delicious mix of herbs and spices. They served it with a great aioli sauce, a kale salad and sweet potato fries. My friend had the walnut meat salad which was HUGE but she said it tasted great. We had the Hibiscus Cooler and Green Apple Lime Refresh. It was a bit pricy but no more so than a good sushi lunch. The portions were very generous. The atmosphere was great, lots of couples, families, young and old, and all very down to earth. They also had an extensive GF, GFO, and RAW (basically uncooked)  selection. At some point I'm going back for the RAW! Arizona Roll (vegan sushi) and Abundance juice soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning place! The best raw rolls ever!  Delicious, well-priced, but worths it 100%. Cafe is pretty big and spacious.  The variety is generous. Although I wish they could be STRICTLY vegan place as I have heard a conversation that they can make You a non-vegan replacement if You don't like  tofu for instance.  Also, they have a dog-friendly patio, which I personally don't support, because food and pet bacteria is not a good mixture."}
{"text":"I came in hoping to order some food over lunch and make it back to work in time. However, it took over an hour to get my food. We were never updated by the waitress on why it was so slow and when our food would be coming out, we just played a very long waiting game.   The staff was nice and overall I'd say the food was average."}
{"text":"100000 STARS FOR VEGANS AND THOSE WITH DIETARY RESTRICTIONS!  Seriously though, I recently went dairy-free and it's hard to find options at restaurants when eating out. Pomegranate Cafe has an extremely vegan-friendly menu, and lots of modification options.  Best of all it's super delicious!!! Highly recommend going for brunch, and don't leave without stopping at the bakery case or grabbing a Cowgirl Cookie!  Pictured: Breakfast Burrito & Green Goddess \"Burger\""}
{"text":"I have stopped in a couple times to try their coffee and juices. Pretty unique place with a hipster meets vegan vibe. I like it. Service is very nice.  Tried their coffe since it was peixoto beans and was not to fond of their lattes as it is hard to hold a candle to the original coffee shop. The hibiscus cooler is solid! Great and refreshing . The magic coffee is very different for a latte not really my favorite . Just noticed they serve nitro coffee and will have to try next."}
{"text":"Place is ok. My girlfriend gets really jacked on going here and the food is always great. The service has been lacking each time we go. We usually sit for a while before anyone even brings us water, then the wait to order is forever."}
{"text":"I haven't been back since my last review, and I'm so pleasantly surprised. Everything looks beautiful inside and the workers are vibrant and friendly. I'm so excited and happy for them that they are expanding and I can't wait to visit again and see their growth. It truly shows how much the owners care, that they take constructive criticism and turn it around into a positive. Thanks for being my favorite Tukee spot!"}
{"text":"The rainbow salad is so delicious. They lightly toss the greens in a subtle dressing and top it with spiralized beets and carrots, cauliflower and  avocado among other veggies and seeds...paired with some sort of creamy nut based dressing that's so good.   The nachos are delicious as well.   Tons of gluten free options for both dinner and dessert. Service is nice but sometimes the sense of urgency is lacking. Oh well! The food is what matters"}

{"text":"Well if you're into that super healthy eating this is t he place for you! If you're into meats with flavor this not the place for you but all in all the atmosphere is niice and the mood is chill definitely not a place for me!"}
{"text":"Short form: ordered our food (15 minutes elapse) we get our iced teas (15 minutes elapse) the tables next to us that had ordered and were seated before we got there get SOME of their food, one sends soup back because it's cold.   (15 minutes elapse) 45 minutes into this disaster, I ask for a refund and we leave   Menu didn't look that appetizing, service was awful, and apparently what they served was poorly executed.  That's enough to keep me from ever going back.  (I should have written a review that takes 45 minutes to read, yet you get nothing from it.... kind of like going to Pomegranate)"}
{"text":"It was surprisingly good Vegan food. I had breakfast there and the cinnamon french toast was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"This place is every vegan and vegetarians dream! I visited on Tuesday around lunch time and I came right before the lunch rush where people had to wait for tables and for the kitchen to catch up with tickets. They did only have 2 waiters which was a bummer but if we needed anything the front cashier would ring it up and put it on our tab. She was very friendly and it helped sitting in front of the dessert display distracting us in how delicious everything looked. Outer waiter was a gentlemen and even though he was swamped that Tuesday he was very friendly and polite. I did wait a more than I'm use to on my lunch, but..... come on this ain't no Chili's where things are frozen ahead and deep fried in minutes."}
{"text":"I came with a friend who loved this place  for her birthday dinner and I must say, I loved it too! This was my first time trying vegan food and I was really nervous to try since the prices are kinda high. However I loved the food and the proportions were really big! And I was extremely impressed at the desserts. I wish I could've had them all! My only complain would be our waiter who barely checked up on us and had a bad attitude. But the rest of the staff seemed really nice. I can't wait to come again with my family!"}
{"text":"Best raw vegan food in the valley.  They are not exclusively raw, but do have a half dozen or so raw dishes on the menu daily and do a raw special on Fridays.  The quality of the food is excellent.  I have eaten here several dozen times and never had anything that wasn't good."}
{"text":"Best raw vegan cheesecake..ever!  The daily soup and sand was the bomb!  A must try, vegan or not, when in the area!  Highly recommend for all my macro friends!"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after hearing a lot of good things about it, and....it was just okay.  I was happy to see a real, varied organic and vegetarian menu.  The food was good, and fresh, but not worth the price, especially considering you have to go up to the counter and order, and don't receive any real sit-down service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here and have been going to the original location for years. The service has always been incredibly sweet and kind but what really bums me out every time I've come to this location beverages take about 10-15 minutes food takes about 30-45... I saw my cappuccino sit on the counter for a good 10minutes before it was brought to me there were 3 people behind that counter the whole time....And it's not the servers fault when is taking on so many tables I legit wanted to ask if he needed help. I think they just need to bring on more staff or make the staff they have on pick up on guest cues.... and where is the manager to help out???"}
{"text":"Local, Fresh, Organic, Vegan, Raw. Healthy indulgence at its finest.   Finally . . . A little slice of Unprocessed Heaven in Ahwatukee!   My favorite? The Sizzlin' Sesame Salad! Mixed greens, vibrant purple cabbage, tofu, brown rice, broccoli and carrot, topped off with chili almonds and orange miso dressing. Very unique.   Southwestern Mac and Cheese and the Bountiful Bowls were great too, just a little heavy for a work day.   Raw Almond Joy bars are delicious; even better than the original. OMG!!!!! So good.     Adorable décor! Nice remodel and expansion.     Staff is always super friendly, and the owner(s) will come around and chat with you personally which is always nice to see.   Just don't be a jackass and bring in food from Los Dos Molinos (or anywhere else)!   Don't let the vegan / vegetarian labels scare you - there's something for everyone at Pomegranate!"}
{"text":"10/06/12  Thank you Pomegranate Cafe, Russell, and all of PC's other staff members for helping me forget, for an hour or so, that I was feeling very much under-the-weather.  l was feeling elated about my upcoming delights, I totally forgot how awful I must have looked wearing yoga pants, a Life is Good tee, a hooded zip pullover, and glasses.  What a bum!  Surprisingly, business was bustling this morning-- I've never seen PC full of people, and get this, there was a LINE waiting to order!  Because most of the tables were taken indoors, it was very noisy, so I took this chance to hide my I'm-sick-as-a-dog bum from the beautiful people and eat OUTDOORS.  But first, I had to place my order.  Since I'd already perused the menu online, I knew I was going to have the French toast, no powdered sugar, please, like I usually do, but I wanted to try something new.  The basic breakfast (egg, toast, jam, and fruit) enticed, but I quickly drew towards Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit.  I also thought I'd either try a smoothie or an elixir ($8 each), but the menu online stated to ask for an elixir menu for options.  There was only one, and it was a \"female hormonal concoction\" with something, I lost track, since I didn't need help with my hormones, thank you very much.  (\"Not that there's anything wrong with that.\")  $8 saved.  The smoothie I wanted to try contained pomegranate juice, which I correctly suspected had one or more unwanted ingredients, and for me, that was \"grape seed oil extract.\"  (So glad I spotted those juice bottles in front of the cash register.)  Good- I was able to hang onto $8 of my money.  Last, but not least, I ordered a cappucino (Cartel Coffee) and a glass of water without cucumber.  I again reiterated that I did not want powdered sugar on the French toast, which I was told would take twenty or twenty-five minutes to be ready, since they'd run out of the bread and the next batch was in the oven.  I said it was worth waiting for, so I don't mind, and besides, I'll have the kamut toast and almond butter.  As I paid for my three items, I was told that my food will be out in about 30 minutes, which took me by surprise, but I was in no mood to make a fuss, especially when I needed to secure an empty table before someone else snatched it!  I found one outdoors, but it needed bussing.  No problem, as I found a shy and cute associate to help me.  One thing I really like about frequenting vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free venues, is how most, if not all, of the staff members are so humble, and are good-natured.  Another thing is that these venues tend to look so hippy-chic, colorful, eclectic, and FUN!  I loved the different swaths of colorful curtains, brightly-painted tables and chairs, whimsical dinnerware, and that was indoors!  Outside, I found a mosaic two-top with mismatched chairs- I sat on the one without the morsel of food on its seat.  The food didn't take quite as long as 30 minutes.  The cappucino http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw#b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw took a few minutes to arrive, and so did the lovely-tasting city water, nicely contained in a lidless canning jar.  (There's a reason cucumber slices are used to \"flavor\" the water, folks!)  It was about ten minutes after I started sipping my coffee that the Banana bread French toast arrived http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw#ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw, but it was sprinkled with powdered sugar!  However, Russell did not hesitate in taking it back and bringing another.  What terrific service!  The Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit plate stayed, however, so I was happy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g#s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g  Still happy, even when I found out that the almond butter was the raw variety-- I don't particularly like its flavor, or lack thereof, and I only buy and enjoy the roasted kind.  It's a good thing I am not allergic to chia (still experimenting), sesame, and sunflower seeds, for while the menu did not mention these were included, one certainly could not avoid their presence on this dish!  It's also a good thing they were, since they gave the bland-tasting almond butter much-needed flavor.  The fun textures on this dish also gave my mouth something to be happy about!  The Banana bread French toast arrived about 5 minutes later, and what a marvel that was! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg#vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg  The French toast had the PERFECT crunch on the outside, a gorgeous pound-cake-meets-angel-cake consistency on the inside, and a wonderful roasted-banana scent filled the air around my face that soon delighted my taste buds!  The strawberry-rhubarb jam and agave pancake syrup added lovely velvety coats of sweetness and colors, as well.  I could've eaten the entire dish!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I like to give a place a few chances before writing a review like this... I've been to Pomegranate Cafe at least 4 or 5 times now.  First their food is SO expensive for what you get.  And the quality of food is just meh - they have a few exceptional items, but for the most part, the food isn't super impressive.  Now let's talk about why they get only 2 stars... their service.  They have this large beautiful dining area indoor and outdoor - but never enough staff to accommodate how many people can fit.  The service has been extremely slow - every. single. time.  Today was a special kind of slow.  It took 2.5 hours from the time we got seated to the time we got our checks.  They offered us free desserts to take home to make up for the long waits, then get this... the server took one of the desserts off our pile (we put them on the counter behind us to save table space) and gave one of our complimentary desserts to another customer!!! And then - they ran out of that specific dessert!!!!! Like who does that?  Also they ran out of another food item I had ordered and substituted it with something else without asking if that is what I wanted.  It was literally insane.  I'm so disappointed with this place now.  I wanted to like them.  If it were only meh food, I probably wouldn't have written a review - but the combo of meh food and terrible service has crossed the line and people should know so they can at least fix the service problem!  If you know it's going to be busy (which it's is every single weekend I have been), make sure you have the staff to accommodate your capacity!!!"}
{"text":"I love their Power Kale Salad and their AB& J Bowl!!!!  I'm a natural carnivore yet to mix up the calories, I highly recommend this place for their healthy salads and fabulous staff. They have indoor and outdoor seating and 2 thumbs up for their dog friendly patio. Only drawback to this place is I wish the weekday hours were until 9pm but other than that, it's a winner!  Tuesday-Thursday: 8 am - 8 pm Friday & Saturday: 8 am - 9 pm  Sunday: 8 am - 4 pm Closed Mondays"}
{"text":"I love PC. A little on the pricey side but so worth it. The nachos the burger and fries are my favorite so far. I haven't tried their desserts yet but that is next on the list. Try it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food at Pomegranate is amazing! I had the Big Kahuna burger and it was delicious. I often order garden burgers at other vegan restaurants, and this was the best! I usually order the Kung Pao burrito, which is out of this world good! I took one to-go Really like the staff....friendly and cool too. If I could I would give 9 Stars!"}
{"text":"Furious and starving are the last two things you want to leave a restaurant. In the past, when the Pom screwed up an order of mine, they apologized and gave me a gift certificate (anywhere from $2-10). This I found odd, because other places I go, if the waiter or cook forgets and puts the allergen(s) in my food, I usually get a meal comped. I thought that was the industry standard. I am not saying I expect this, but I found it odd, as the first time it happened, the $2 didn't even cover the tax on the meal. Honestly, all I *really* want is my food, free of things that would cause me a trip to the hospital.  I am a regular customer; I come in there at least once a month with a group of friends. Being that I have a lot of food restrictions, I usually order the same delectable item. However, I was told to have them make it from scratch (the rainbow wrap) because they pre-make them every morning, and in the past, when I ordered it without my allergens - raw tomatoes and onions - they've forgotten, or didn't pick out all of them, and once had to remake it *twice* because the cook was totally on autopilot.  One would think that at a place like this, food allergies would be understood and accommodated without question. However, the other day I arrived with my group, and when I attempted to order, was told, sorry, we're too busy to accommodate you. So it was a question of either order something else (which I either couldn't have or didn't want) or take my life into my hands. That is just not a fair option.   As it was, I was so hungry I couldn't wait an hour or two for the line to decrease, so I left. I thought about picking up something at TJ's and bringing it back there to dine with my friends, but why? Clearly they don't want my business, so why patronize a restaurant that doesn't want to sell me food?"}
{"text":"Good healthy food. You can taste the organic ingredients from the very first bite! However, service is always extremely slow and the place is usually very crowded. So, make sure set aside plenty of time to truly enjoy your experience"}
{"text":"Man, I really really hate to give a vegan cafe a low rating. I have two stars simply because it's vegan. Otherwise, it's truly a bust. The Mac and cheese took 40 minutes (at a non busy time) and was cold when I got it. The j-whatever version of coffee they have along with the Pom milk left much to be desired. I am not a picky person but I had to send it back. Asked for a juice instead and it took 15 MORE minutes to get a lemonade to my table! It sucks because I drove an hour to get here but I definitely will not be back. Skip this cafe and try another one instead.  Lemonade was tasty, Shay had awesome customer service... other than that I was not a fan."}
{"text":"This is my first time here! Recently moved here from another state. Not a vegetarian or vegan, but I do enjoy making healthy food choices regularly. Had the Avocado Sandwich & the Island Green smoothie! Absolutely delicious!  The staff was extremely awesome in helping me decide what to order. As a former manager at Jamba Juice for 4 years, I've had my fair share in health food training & the staff definitely knows their stuff.  I will definitely become a regular here!"}
{"text":"Awesome food every time!  We have been coming here for years and the food just keeps getting better.  The owner is passionate about her business and it shows through in her final product.  If you are interested in eating healthy you can't go wrong here.   We particularly love the southwestern mac and cheese and elephant curry bowl.  The staff lately has been particularly great!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Healthy, organic/local options, breakfast, great staff, and fresh squeezed orange juice"}
{"text":"Finally!! I have been meaning to go to the place forever.  Organic cafe with great food and such a great vibe.  Love the cowgirl cookies and the hummus is amazing.  Why can't they open another location closer to scottsdale?"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!! The staff are always so friendly and are great with our kids! He patio is an excellent added bonus! If you go try the walnut taco meat! One word...heaven!!! A great local joint! 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I am biased because my family members own this cute little cafe. However, I'm a picky eater, plus I'm a vegetarian (5 years strong). Cassie (my moms cousin) is the sweetest and smartest human on the planet. She is so creative and innovative. I've been here countless times and not once have I been disappointed. For an all vegetarian/vegan restaurant, I've got to say that they're doing excellent. I recommend this to anyone coming to the Phoenix area! I've brought my friends, and even my father, who lives out of town and is the pickiest eater, and he even agrees that the food was delicious, along with their coffee. Needless to say they deserve 6 stars. It's a busy little place and they've renovated multiple times to keep up with the growing traffic. I love Pomegranate Cafe and I'm excited to watch it flourish."}
{"text":"Another place that I've been dying to try! I finally made it in and am so glad I did. I had a vegan Monte Cristo on gluten free bread, with a side of potato salad.  It was so delicious  and satisfying,  didn't even miss the lack of meat(or gluten)! I also enjoyed a latte(dairy free) with my meal. A touch pricey, but not bad considering the quality of the ingredients. I'll be back, and maybe next time I'll get a chance to check out the store attached with all the healthy goodies they sell!"}
{"text":"Didn't know it was vegan when I walked in but I walked out a happy (and well fed) camper. The menu is jammed with all kinds of delicious sounding options. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they offer green juice shots (the bitter-but-good-for-you kind) with a pomegranate juice chaser. Nice touch! Food is excellent and very fresh. Server was incredibly helpful for my first time there. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix the other day and was hoping to find a Vegan restaurant so I immediately got on Yelp and found this place. After reading a few of the reviews and getting a bit curious I decided to come in here. Best choice ever! It was absolutely delicious! I asked for a quesadilla which was amazing!!! The only thing that I wasn't a big fan of was the big pieces of; I believe it was pepper and onions, but that was my fault since I should have asked what they put in it. It was also pricey, I believe my total came out to $12, but for vegan food that you see them make right in front of you. What do you expect? It was so worth it and I hope to be visiting Arizona again soon so I can come back here! It was absolutely delicious!! I'm craving it again right now!"}
{"text":"This little cafe is so cute in every way. They have options for both vegan and vegetarian and the rest.  The decor is kind of country incorporating wood furniture with contemporary light fixtures with vibrant and colorful paintings of plants and flowers.  We had a sweet server.  She was an absolute doll.  I usually ask for help when I have a hard time choosing and the options on the menu were things like biscuit and gravy, quiche lorraine, but the Pomegranate had it's own twist that made each dish, even if traditional american fare, exciting.  The coffee and espresso sounded so tasty but I'd already had my fill.  My compadre enjoyed the Coconut caramel latte.  Mmmmm-of course I had a sip.  I ordered the quiche lorraine  that was topped with the Jalapeño creme and was accompanied with a side salad.  Yum! It had  thick crust and I can't tell you all the ingredients but it was flavorful and a little spicy.  I enjoyed it.  The salad was a great side kick.  It was greens and shredded carrots tossed in what tasted like coconut aminos and citrus!  Yum!  My taste buds were happy!  my friend had a breakfast wrap which was ginormous!  Think cut in two and chipotle sized.  I had a great time here!  The wait time on a Saturday was fast, the atmosphere was casual and the food was awesome!  When I'm headed their direction again, I'll be by!  It was the perfect brunch spot on my road-trip from Tucson to the San Bernardino, CA area!"}
{"text":"I went back to try their food. The place has been remodeled since I last visited, six months ago. It's bigger and can accommodate more people, but it did lose that vibe that I liked about it. Regardless, the staff was still friendly, the food was delicious, and the drinks were still good!  Drinks: 1) Braveheart (leafy greens, kale, cucumber, celery, apple, orange) 2) Some kind of berry smoothie? Both were refreshing and good.  Entrees: 1) Breakfast Burrito (Egg, potato, sweet potato, cheese, anasazi beans, salsa, seasonal vegetables, spinach tortilla) 2) In Season scramble (Egg scramble, seasonal veggies, cheese, harvest hash, kamut toast & house jam): loved the house jam! 3) Hummus: the bread and veggies were very good and fresh and the hummus was okay. It was a little grainier and had a more cumin taste but it tasted fresh. 4) Raw Berries & Cream Parfait (Raspberry cream, seasonal fruit, berries, nuts & seeds): one of my favorite parts of the meal. SO good"}
{"text":"Order an elephant bowl, save an animal's life! I love that this cafe donates a portion of their earnings on certain items towards worthy causes. I ordered the elephant bowl partially because of this (Wildlife SOS receives $1 from each bowl sold). I also had an iced lavender latte.   The elephant bowl comes with your choice of protein and carb. I chose the walnut meat and kelp noodles. I got the order to go and took a seat to wait for my meal.   The lavender latte was made first and was light and refreshing. It had a hint of the lavender flavor but the main component I could taste was the creamy coconut milk. They use Peixoto coffee which is great since they are an excellent local company that roasts fabulous coffee beans.  The main meal took quite a bit of time to make. I think I was waiting nearly 30 minutes but all the staff members were very apologetic about it. My bowl came in a compressed paper container in a brown paper bag. I placed the bag securely on the passenger side floor mat and I was on my way home.  While driving on the way home the curry in the bowl was so watery that it spilled out of the container (Which was on the shallow side and did not have a sauce-proof seal) all over the bag, which caused the bag to leak all over my floor mat. A day later I am still trying to air out my car because curry+ hot car is not a good fragrance in a small enclosed space in the AZ heat!  The actual bowl though was a hefty portion with lots of vegetables, walnut meat, and noodles. The curry sauce that didn't spill out onto my car was full bodied and complimented the rest of the ingredients well. The kelp noodles were intriguing as this was my first time having them. They were clear, had a springy, chewy texture and neutral flavor.   The price was a little high, with my total being a little over $20 with tax. They do use high quality ingredients, use eco friendly packaging, and have generously sized portions to make up for the cost though.  While I enjoyed the bowl and latte, I would definitely not get any orders from here to go again. So, if I'm in the mood to dine in I'll try Pomegranate Cafe again."}
{"text":"I miss coming here. I moved from AZ, and this is almost worth the plane trip in itself for these raw goodies.  Everything is made fresh in house. You won't find corn syrup or sodas, or GMO products. Instead, you will find organic, vegan, and raw selections  that won't make you feel you are sacrificing taste for healthy.  When I'm visiting AZ, this is the first place I want to eat at. Everything here is delicious and while the menu does keep a few classics, it also rotates with fresh soups of the day, desserts, and juices to keep new tempting offerings to chose from, and my taste buds wanting more."}
{"text":"Ordered Bountiful Harvest bowl and a greena Colada smoothie. Both were really cooked to perfection.   Wouldn't mind visiting multiple times."}
{"text":"I'm in love! This place has delicious, healthy food and a cool vibe. Our new weekend lunch stop. The falafel is my favorite. The nachos are a must try. I was thrilled to learn they are expanding."}
{"text":"The food is good and the valley desperately needs more vegan/vegetarian options. However the service is abysmal. I placed an order for pick up and was told it would be 10-15 minutes. I browsed around and waited. After 20 minutes I inquired and was told my food was being put in a box. 5 minutes later I asked again and was told it would be a few more minutes. I left for 10 minutes, went to the store, and when I came back I asked again and was told to wait in line. I did so for 10 minutes and was told it was being put in a  box--how many boxes do I need?The hostess offered no condolence, just told me it would be a few minutes because they were busy.  It took 45 minutes to get a to go order from a half full restaurant.   On another occasion I brought my toddler and asked for a high chair. They say is at a high top--the high chair was a foot lower than the table. Their incompetence can be comical."}
{"text":"I went into Pomegranate Cafe with a friend for lunch. We both ordered some Mexican style burritos and I can't recall the name now. The food was delicious, as was the dessert and the juice. The only down fall was the price. For 2 people to eat lunch it was $58! We each ordered a raw dessert and a drink to go with our food but I still felt that was a little steep."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan and enjoy eating non healthy food.  This place is selling unique healthy dishes and it also taste good. I ordered a mushroom burger w English muffins. It taste pretty good. But if you are expecting Red Robin or regular high calories burger taste then this may not be your option :)   This place is good for vegan, vegetarians, gluten free, and healthy eaters. Price is lil high but they use organic ingredients."}
{"text":"As a 30 year vegetarian, I'm so happy they opened in my hood. I like all of the options but I've had one or two dishes that were too heavy on the sauces, making every bite of a big rice bowl taste exactly the same. Next time, I'm ordering the sauces on the side! Be forewarned they are pricier than the other local level lunch spots. If they weren't, I'd be there much more often. Their smoothies and juices are off the charts expensive. $12? Um no. My meat eating friends and family like the place too!"}
{"text":"I was a regular at Pom for many years. Quality has gone downhill recently. I'm not sure if the chefs have changed, but the food no longer has the appeal is did previously. The wait times are long and prices are high."}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Always enjoy the food.  Step out of the box and try something new here."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy! I am a certified meat eater, but their walnut taco meat totally won me over. Everything is fresh and delicious. I'll have to try one of their desserts next time."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Perfect for any dietary needs or preferences. Cute date spot for any of you herbivore couples. Glad they're opened up late again!"}
{"text":"After going to the other Pomegranate Cafe in Ahwatukee, I had very high expectations for this location. Unfortunately I will less than impressed with my first time here. I had ordered one of the wraps which I have had before at the other location, and when I got it I noticed it was missing a ton of the ingredients that were listed in the menu. It didn't even have the ranch dressing that it was supposed to come with. For paying $14 for a wrap, I would expect a little bit more. Our service was pretty slow so I decided to just eat my meal and not say anything. I think in the future I will make the drive to the Ahwatukee location where i've never had a bad experience/meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere and the speed of service has improved greatly!!! Some of the best treats I have ever had in here. Kids love it too!"}
{"text":"If there is one thing I love it is meat. But my best friend has been a vegetarian the last 7 years and recently became vegan. So this was my first time here and I absolutely loved it. I got the Athena salad which was under $10 for the small. I was surprised by how much came in it. I couldn't even finish it because I was full.  We also got a side of the avocado toast with herb bread. It was probably my favorite of all. The bread had so much flavor. We sat outside and had such a nice server. Everything came out within 20  minutes or so, and it was a Sunday. I loved everything about this place, from the cucumber water, to the amazing sweets they had inside. I had the cookie dough truffle covered in chocolate, it was so good! I loved this place, and everything was vegan!! Amazing!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for vegan breakfast! Today's feast included pecan cinnamon rolls and a tofu scramble! Their secret weapon is an innocent looking pomegranate jam! Knock your sox off!"}
{"text":"Love that there are tons of vegetarian, vegan and raw options, and the recipes are different than what you'd expect. They regularly update their menu. The first time I went there they had different types of bowls, burritos, sandwiches, smoothies, juices. They even have a bakery up front. The decor is cute, pomegranate-themed of course, but not in your face. (They even put pomegranate seeds in your water!) The backs of the chairs have enticing words like \"fresh,\" and \"natural.\" You really feel like a lot of love was put into the cafe to provide people with fresh organic food.   They do have mock meat but they have descriptions of what it is made out of. I had the kelp noodle bowl which had clear kelp noodles, mushrooms and marinated tofu. My friend had the sushi (no meat)... sooooo good! The employees are very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, the second time my boyfriend and I decided to go, we arrived after 4pm on a weekday, which is the time they closed. So disappointing! Instead, we had to go to the Mexican restaurant in the shopping center. I would also like to point out that the placement of the cafe is spot on as far as the trend of natural healthy living because it's next to Trader Joe's, a natural pet food store and a yoga studio."}
{"text":"We had delicious meals. A great place for fresh Vegan eating. Portions were plentiful and we took home plenty for another meal. We will eat there again. The staff were a big plus as well. Thanks."}
{"text":"Food is great here. Been here a few times with my wife and meals have all been good. It is a little pricey but you get a good size meal. Definately will be back."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious & there was a lot to choose from. The place is an awesome hangout- hip & earthy. We tried the tamales, breakfast burrito and burger with rainbow juice & strawberry sunrise. The rainbow juice was spicy (ginger) & refreshing. I had more energy & felt healthier after drinking it. The $9 price tag seemed a bit high for a juice but thats prob how much all the veggies cost to put in there. Can't wait to go again and try more of their menu options."}
{"text":"The vegan food here is delicious and good size portions! Although the service does not match the food quality. Poor service, awesome grub"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Me and a friend shared the big kahuna burger and the bountiful bowl. It was very good and the atmosphere is very chill. The only downside was that they were very busy as it was Saturday afternoon and so the service was a little slow."}
{"text":"I went to Pomegranate Cafe today and it was a total disappointment.  I show up and the place is arranged as an \"order yourself\" restaurant, which is perfectly fine.  The first thing you see when you walk in is a big counter, and no directions (or menus on the board, etc).  I walk up to the counter looking to order something, or learn how the process works, and the gentleman behind the counter asks if I'm dining in.  Kind of caught me by surprise because I'm thinking why is that the very first question, I just want to order food.  Let me stop and say that already, while he's polite, he's definitely making me feel like I'm doing something stupid and I should already know how the process works.  He tells me to take a seat anywhere, I look around and there are no seats available, he realizes it and he says there's plenty of seating outside.  That's good with me, I like sitting outside even in az, and he says he'll take water to me.  Ok so far not too bad even though the process is awkward and I still haven't seen anything resembling a menu.  But here's where it gets really bad.  I go ahead and take my seat outside and just wait, and wait, and wait.  No water, no menu, no greeting from any waiter, NOTHING.  Of course now I'm disappointed; I followed the directions from the guy at the counter and proceed to be completely ignored.  I felt like leaving at this point (who wants to be ignored?), but I was craving their type of food and had gone out of my way to go there today, so I thought I'd give it another try.  I walk back in to the place and speak with another nice young gentleman who after learning what had taken place proceeded to only say \"oh when we're not busy we like doing table service so we'll follow you with a menu, but I think when you sat down we got busy in a rush.\"  That makes no sense at all of course, I was perfectly willing to order at the counter but they were the ones who asked me to grab a table/seat.  Then he did nothing except give me this card that has a link to their website and a couple of marketing tag lines.  Did not say sorry, let me take care of you now, or anything.  I stood there not knowing what to do so I just said thank you and walked out.  Extremely disappointed, because I was looking forward to trying this place after I heard good things about it.  This really should be a one star review, but I'm leaving two stars for two reasons: one because I didn't actually get to try their food (unfortunately), and two because if I leave a one star this review may not be taken seriously, and I do feel If nothing else that their management should fix this.  I understand they may cater to a lot of regulars and a certain type of clientele, but I'm sure they would welcome new clients as well.  Today they did not, despite repeated opportunities."}
{"text":"My son and I went here for breakfast. I was served granola with fruit that was frozen  solid. Avoid the granola, it is more granola than any human could eat and only a smidge of milk, plus it is WAY too expensive. We spent $40 on breakfast, not worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place good RAW options . Nicole was our server she's very nice an informative"}
{"text":"We went on Valentine's day, which was very rainy and cold. They had barely anyone in the place but said that we would have to share a table with another couple because of reservations . They had a pricey valentine's four course meal which we did not choose from . we opted for the nachos which were good. Over priced and atmosphere felt more like a cafeteria . We probably will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This cafe is 100% vegetarian, with the vegan option available on every menu item.  From past experiences with veggie restaurants in Phoenix, this kind of classification would probably make me less eager to try the place......  which is why I'm happy that the chef/owner instead chose to focus on the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients -- vegetarianism is more of an afterthought.  So we decided to try it yesterday for lunch.  To start, Pomegranate offers a wonderful selection of teas, coffees, and various juice/smoothie options.  I wanted something cool and caffeinated, so I ordered the toddy, which features my favorite local roaster's beans -- Cartel.  My wife order a peach iced tea.  Very good, but if memory serves correctly, you won't find any drink options for less than $2.00 or so.  Then onto the main course.  I ordered the veggie burger, which is made from a sprouted tofu, served on a sprouted spelt bun, and garnished with cheddar cheese (or vegan cheese if you prefer), avocado, tomato, and a little tiny dollop of miso mayonnaise.  It also comes with a catch-all selection of sides: salad, tortilla chips, fruit slices, and a pickle.  $10 or so.....  Here's my take on the burger:  The spelt bun was better than any other spelt bun/bread that I've ever had before.  This was perhaps the second most notable part of this burger.  The most notable was the patty itself, which had a nice mellow nutty flavor -- not trying too hard to be be fake beef and not overpowering in soy flavor.  It was actually one of my favorite veggie burgers ever.  But here's my beef with the preparation: too skimpy on the rich, fatty stuff.  There was a very thin slice of cheese and almost nothing of the single condiment provided, which the menu told me was a miso mayo.  Thanks to the avocado, it was still a little rich, but not the kind of juicy decadence that I've always felt characterizes a great burger.  And seriously, I would have liked to have tasted the miso mayonnaise, but instead added my salad dressing to the burger to make it less dry, and this basically obscured whatever taste the mayo may have offered.  The salad was just fine, garnished with what seemed like a raw berry dressing of some sort.  I had no idea that the white stuff in the plastic cup was also for the salad (apparently a living caesar dressing), until the meal was almost over.  I thought it was my mayonnaise for the burger.  Next time, I'll try to get it right and see how the salad tastes with both dressings.  We also tried the hummus, mainly because it's the perfect baby-appropriate snack for my son to sling all over the restaurant (the remarkably polite staff was also quite pleasant about bringing in a messy toddler, by the way, which is a plus).  The hummus was actually quite tasty, but somehow not in a \"traditional\" way.  It seemed a little crisper and fresher than most hummus I've had, which was a nice complement to the fresh veggies served with it.  My only additional request for the hummus is that perhaps the restaurant could throw in a few tortilla chips as well?  My wife tried the vegan BLT, made with a tempeh-based bacon.  It must have been tasty, because this is one of the first times I've missed my opportunity to try a bite of her dish.  She literally devoured it and then criticized me for nitpicking at the veggie burger's preparation.  I'm pretty sure she'd give this place a 5-star rating, and she may convince me to do the same on our return visit with the in-laws, who have been looking for a place like this.  Oh, one final note.  I spoke with the chef/owner after our meal, to offer our compliments and inquire about the cuisine and the marketplace, etc.  She mentioned something that should be readily apparent to most foodies, which is that the key to providing tasty veggie options is to go with a macrobiotic whole food focus -- this approach de-emphasizes the constraints and instead focuses on building a good meal from quality ingredients.  Well done, chef."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer and could afford this place on a regular basis! The food is always fantastic but the price is a little much. They do give you lots of food though! It's always a little crowded and the food kind of takes longer than it should (about 30 minutes) Staff is always super friendly"}
{"text":"I love Pomegranate!  Everything that I have tried has been amazing and the service has always been excellent!  The only downside is that the prices are a bit more expensive than other vegan places, but they offer many organic ingredients to justify the prices.  I love their bakery items and I would visit much more often if I didn't live so far away!"}
{"text":"Great menu. I had the pizza, almond joy bar and one of pomegranate soda mixes. Everything tasted fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"My little brother brought me a BBQ Buffalo Salad from Pomegranate cafe today. I need some greens in my life and he suggested the spot. My salad was loaded with high quality ingredients and was quite good. And I felt so healthy eating it- everything from the power greens to the tofu tasted so yummy and super duper fresh."}
{"text":"It's a real bummer that this place is so far away from my part of town.  I was lucky enough to be in the area.  This place is a true vegans paradise.  If you are Vegan then you will not be disappointed with their menu.  They also cater to Vegetarians so if you're not full Vegan you will also fit right in.  Service is great and the patio is a great place to sit if the weather permits.  Don't forget to try some of there delicious baked goods.  All of which are made Vegan style."}
{"text":"Super yummy ! I'm not a vegetarian or vegan so I was iffy on the food at first , so glad I tried it out . Had the avo jalapeño crisp and a smoothie . Best lunch I've had in a long time ."}
{"text":"I visited Pomegranate Cafe for lunch with several colleagues. The juices and smoothies looked amazing, but I held off because they were $9 and I'm cheap. I opted instead for the Green Bandito Burrito. The service was prompt, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Upon my first taste of the burrito, I exclaimed that I wanted to marry it and have its babies. This burrito was equal parts hearty, flavorful and delicious (quite an accomplishment for vegan fare). It arrived nestled next to a strawberry pecan salad and a side of mild salsa. The price was slightly steep, but you can't put a price on happiness. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious food, good prices & a great happy hour.  One of my new favorite vegan spots in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My son and I came for dinner and we fell in love. We recently moved to Ahwatukee and we're looking for a restaurant that had plenty of gluten-free options. My son was recently diagnosed with Celiac's Disease and he's been having a difficult time with it because his diet was pretty much anything on bread. He walked right in and asked if they had gluten free food (he's 6) and the staff was so friendly and inviting to him. They didn't seem annoyed with him at all for asking if everything (item by item) was gluten free. We ordered the Mac and cheese for him and the nachos to share and I had the mushroom burger. It was all tasty! The nachos were pretty spicy, their jalapeños are no joke! I love that they're 98% organic and vegan. They're also a socially conscious business! They compost, recycle, and shop locally for their food. Such a cute ambience too! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"FINALLY, The Funk has come back to South Phoenix.  Have you ever done something one day and was more upset the next day about what you did? Well that's how I feel about dropping $45 on Pomegranate cafe for a late veggie lunch - solo. (I can imagine the heads shaking from all the carnivores. That's steak money, right?)   Yeah, I feel ya'. My support for veggie eateries is quickly waning. They are over-priced and can be quite pretentious with the creativity.  So, I was down south on a hot afternoon and really worked up a sweat. I remembered reading that Pomegranate Cafe sold fresh juice and was located somewhere near 40th St and Chandler Blvd. Had I known to look for the shopping center with Safeway and two doors down from Trader Joes....Landmarks, folks! Very important when giving directions....   PC's white and pink sign is a tad dull against the building. If I wasn't specifically looking for the cafe, I probably would have missed it and gone somewhere else to eat. But anyway, I walked in, grabbed all the menus (regular, HH, and juice bar), and had a seat. (Only order at the counter if you want take-away).   Asked for a juice right away and despite the \"slow service\" comments that other reviewers have posted, I wasn't too bothered by the several minutes it took for juice to make its way to my table. I pushed aside water and guzzled it down. Aahhh. I could feel, see, hear, smell, sense, taste, perceive the essence of life coursing through my veins. That must be the feeling Popeye gets  after eating spinach (mmmm, love those greens).  Why only three stars for PC? One for just being veggie + One for being freshly made + One for serving fresh juice   Fresh juice was the best part of my afternoon. I wasn't too impressed with the food. I ordered off the regular menu like an idiot and hit myself later for not giving the happy hour menu a chance. Could've saved myself half the price.   Truth be told - I should've stopped with the juice, paid the bill, and walked away. But, ooh, I spied with my little eye jackfruit tacos and jackfruit sliders.   - BBQ jackfruit sliders (3) for $12: jackfruit, peppers, onions, jalapeno cabbage slaw, chimichurri on bun.  Even though I asked for the BBQ sauce on the side, the jackfruit itself had a sickly sweetness that cancelled my enjoyment. What I really liked, though, were the silver dollar-sized buns.   - Jamaican jerk street tacos (3) for $12: jerk seasoned jackfruit, cabbage slaw, pico, baja sauce, chimichurri on corn tortillas.  Did that say jamaican? Show me the jerk who thought of that because wurnt no part of those tacos Jamaican. Spicy? Nope. All I could taste was that sickly sweet jackfruit. Created and tasted exactly like the sliders.    The jackfruit wasn't prepared the way I'm used to having it. In fact I couldn't even tell that it was jackfruit by sight because it was mixed with other stuff and only one spoonful of it was buried under the mounds of cabbage slaw and sauce.  When I mentioned the sweetness to the two staff members who checked on me they blamed the jackfruit. Really? I know what jackfruit tastes like. Even when fresh it's not overly sweet. Either this jackfruit was sweetened and then packaged, or one of PC's sauces used in the dishes was too sweet. Won't order it again.   - For dezzert, a slice of tropical cake. Good cake, real cake, but could have used more tropics and less sugary lemon frosting. AGAIN with the sweetness.  Overall, PC's dishes are very colourful and look beautiful. I'll try a wrap and/or salad next time, but I won't go out of my way to eat there again any time soon.  Four items averaged to about $10 apiece, then tax and probably a surcharge for a take out box.  You would think that would have filled me up, but actually I stopped somewhere else on the way back to central Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love vegetarian restaurants! I support them 200%. So glad this place exists in Phoenix. The quality of the food is beyond excellent. The meals are creative and super tasty. Never disappointed. The only qualm I have is the service. It...is...slow. Whether it's the time it takes for my meal to reach my table or the cashier taking my order to ring it up correctly. The length of time it takes should not be so long. Prices are a bit steep but most vegetarian/vegan restaurants are priced a bit higher than others. I don't mind paying more for quality. Overall this place is a favorite weekend visit. I can't wait for my next meal at Pomegranate Cafe."}
{"text":"A bit disappointing compared to their location on Chandler Blvd that I have been to on several occasions.  The food is great quality (a bit pricey but understanding the quality, justified the price) it is VERY child friendly & not the best spot to pick on a weekend for a few adults to try have a conversation over a meal, as it is extremely loud.  The tile floors & family style seating makes for a challenging chat!!! The wait staff friendly & efficient, I simply wish it were not so loud"}
{"text":"Very good health food/natural food/gluten free/vegetarian/ yada yada cafe. Fun vibe in and out. Feels like it should be on Venice Beach in Los Angeles - was very surprised to find it in Ahwatukee. The Mermaid salad was a huge combo of dark greens/seaweeds/tofu - I recommend it for a guilt free dinner. Friends had GF mac and cheese and a huge burrito. All seemed to enjoy. Desserts were mostly raw and 'ehh'. I wouldn't spend the money on the desserts (because when did a healthy dessert really taste great?) There is wine, beer, cider. The specialty cocktails were a bit on the pricey side so I can't say if they were worth the $13 bucks.There is also a happy hour menu but we did not order from it."}
{"text":"This place is always packed! So I thought I would try it it's very Organic and whole foodie if that makes sense so if you like that type of food then this is place for you don't go when your starving cause it's always like 20/30min wait and don't go during prime hours because there's just way too many ppl !"}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience. The service is lacking, good luck getting what you ordered!  All that healthy food must be rotting their brains!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place...except for the damage it did to my wallet. I had the lucky dragon bowl and a side of the potato salad. Both items were unlike anything else I've ever tried, which isn't something I can say very often. I loved the creative approach to each of the items. The fact that they were able to create such unique flavors while incorporating vegan, organic and non-gmo ingredients is even more impressive. My only complaint is the cost of the meal makes the restaurant more of a special occasion spot than a regular in my restaurant rotation. Mostly, I'm just bummed that I can't go every week to try something new without taking out a second mortgage. I guess it's true though ... you can't put a price on quality. Try this place out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazingly great food!  The sandwiches and salads are delicious....the deserts are so decadent!  I really loved the shabby chic earth friendly decor....very friendly staff.  You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"My little sister works here and she tells me about all the amazing food all the time!  I love this place!  The food is well prepared, fresh, and tasty. I love the gila nachos and the burritos! The staff is friendly. They often have live music playing which is nice too. I just have so much love for this place that I can't put into words.  :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The food is amazing. We have tried a lot of their menu and we have never been disappointed. Service can be slow due to the small kitchen and limited staff but I would say worth it overall.  We will be back time after time!"}
{"text":"The raw chocolate banana cake was fantastic! I had the burger of the day, which was sweet potato, and it was very flavorful. As an omnivore (non-vegan?), I was very satisfied with this place. It was a bit pricey for my tastes, but I realize those food costs are high to begin with. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love that you leave this place feeling so full but not so guilty because you know everything is nutritious and healthy.I love their coffee here too, espresso has an awesome flavor! A bit pricy but hey everything is organic and like supporting our local businesses! Some of my favorites are: Green garden protein bowl All coffee drinks Chocolate pomegranate cake Sizzling sesame salad"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday when Pomegranate had a freshly made Coconut Lime Cake.  I have discovered a new reason to live  :) mmmmm"}
{"text":"Went to eat here yesterday(Sunday) at 130. We had a party of four and we go to the host stand and we were told there would be a 20 minute wait. Ok no big deal however we look around and there are a number of open tables. So we sit out side in the patio and wait and wait and wait. Finally I got up and got us menus then the host came over with waters 20 minutes later. Almost a half hour later we get a waitress. We of course order right away. A smoothie bowl, cinnamon roll and a green goddess burger. The food was great which is why I'm giving this a 2 star. However we got the smoothie bowl first then 7-8 minutes later we got the burger and about 15 minutes later we got the cinnamon roll. Nothing came out together. I don't know if they make the cinnamon roll from scratch as people order but it should not have taken almost a half an hour for a cinnamon roll. Never once were we asked if we wanted anything to drink other then the host bringing us waters. The service was beyond horrible however the food was really good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Period. Blew my mind.  This is my new all-time favorite restaurant. The food. The service. The atmosphere. All spot on!"}
{"text":"OMG.... The food here is amazing! I got a bowl and my bf got a burrito along witj the baked fries! The food is amazing! Portions are HUGE so beware! We couldnt finish our food so we had to take it to go but it was sooo soooo good!"}
{"text":"If you're a vegan this place is must have. The atmosphere is cozy. The staff is very knowledgeable about vegan needs. I got the cheese crisp and bounty burrito phenomenal!  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First time having vegan and raw vegan dessert. I got the special Samoan cookies and the vegan pomegranate cake. They also threw in the vegan peanut butter cup :)   The vegan peanut butter cup is good nothing crazy, but a good starter.   The Samoan cookie reminded me exactly like the girl scout Samoan cookies. Except the consistency is wet and moist like. It's also a lot larger!  As for the vegan pomegranate cake, I was not impressed. It just tasted plain but the frosting was delicious.  Overall, they have some pretty good desserts. I need to come back and try their food!  The staff is very nice!!"}
{"text":"This place is yummy. I had a delicious breakfast burrito wrapped in collard greens. The tahini did had a delicious kick to it. The fruit salad was awesome. I had a real egg but I think the tofu scramble my friend had looked awesome. The fruit salad on the side was fresh and tasty. I also had the cookie dough truffle which was the perfect snack later on in my day. I really enjoyed the food!  I'm updating my review because when I came back the service was so slow. It took over 40 minutes to get our order and we had kids with us. At the very least our server should have given them something to color if the weight was going to be that long. Also, no eta on order in all that time. We bought some deserts after and they couldn't break a $20. Very strange."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in restaurant. Everyday they have such a lovely menu. The Food, juice and desserts are so yummy! I switch up my order everytime because this place has so much to offer. The staff is always so friendly and knowledgeable. If you are looking for a fantastic treat I highly suggest the cowgirl cookies! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to live right by Pomegranate cafe!! Everything here is delicious!! So far I've had the Falafel con papas and the Avocado sandwich.. both with tofu. They both were incredible. Alsooo... I've had a chocolate banana cupcake and a coffee and omg I just love everything these lovely people make.  Don't be in a rush when you go here. Good food takes time. My only wish is that they served matcha lattes."}
{"text":"Gross. Gross. Gross. This place may be vegan but their food safety is abhorrent. Fruit should not be near the floor. There are standards for a reason.  Sanitizer buckets should not be next to the ice. The food is crazy expensive. The wait for food is unreal. Customer service is meh."}
{"text":"What's more important than good food? Good food you can eat, for me that means vegan or vegetarian options. Furthermore, food I can eat sustainably and feel good about.  A friend recommended this place and we went for breakfast. Had the seasonal cherry cappuccino which was bomb.com. The star of the show is the breakfast wraps which absolutely blew my mind.  The people, the food- all exceptional. I truly hope everyone gives this place a shot."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but my dad is one. He seemed really happy with his meal and I was very happy with mine too. I was able get a breakfast burrito with eggs substitutes for tofu. I need my protein in the morning. The place was packed but the service didn't suffer for it. I'd check it out no matter your dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Between 3 and 4 stars. I love the idea and the ambiance was great but the service was very slow. I went here with a friend and when it comes to a point, after you order, where you have to ask how long we've been waiting to each other, we've already waited too long. And then you're thinking, okay we'll give it five more min, every five minutes, three times, we've waited too long. I ordered the lumberjack based on a lot of people's recommendations. It was good but even better without the tempeh on there. I guess it's supposed to be a bacon tempeh but I didn't care for it and in fact, I picked it out if my sandwich and I ended up loving my sandwich! I ordered the Cassie's latte too which was good but I don't think it's something I'll have often. It also got cold while waiting for the meal."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the quality of food.  A great destination for those who are looking for an organic, very tasty meal.  I'd definetely go back."}
{"text":"I love Pomegranate but the menu is very limited compared to the other location. Maybe they will expand it later but for now I was disappointed to see a lot of the favorites not at this lovation"}
{"text":"The kale salad is fantastic, especially the dressing! Lots of vegan and vegetarian offerings that are filling.  My only cautions are the raw desserts really aren't that tasty and most of the entrees contain too much bell pepper.  However, the cowgirl cookies are a big favorite with my husband and son.  The special lemonades are also quite good if a bit pricey (refills aren't free so pace yourself).  This is one of the best vegetarian restaurants in the East Valley and the staff is very friendly - especially Matt!"}
{"text":"Hooray for local and organic, and did I mention healthy and delicious! This place just opened in Ahwatukee, and I am super excited. I just tried their \"courage\" juice  and it is so delicious. I think it has made my afternoon. The place has an awesome atmosphere and philosophy- all green, all local, and all organic. It couldn't be fresher - they were unloading containers of produce as I got there. Plus the staff is super friendly. I can't wait to try breakfast or lunch here the menu looks great, and I will definitely update on  the food as soon as I get to try it!"}
{"text":"Obsessed! You don't have to be vegan to eat here but you might just consider it once you eat this yumminess!"}
{"text":"my wife was excited to read about this place. surprisingly the place had been open since February, but we had hand't heard of it until this last week. awesome little vegan, raw, healthy food cafe. chatted to the owner for some time - discussed vegan cheese cake recipes  and swooped notes. very knowledgeable lady owner and very friendly staff, nice selection of drinks, snacks and main courses. the salad my wife ordered was rather large and very tasty, but couldn't be finished. I had the rice, black beans, guacamole and mixed veggies bowl - yummy."}
{"text":"I gave you all a 2nd try. 11-21-2015 @ 12:30PM and was again disappointed. Food was good, very slow service, actually had to stop another waiter to find our server to order dessert, who then approached in a passive aggressive manner. Dropped desert off without a word (yes we will enjoy, thank you) had to ask a different server to clear plates, get more tea. Etc. dropped the bill without saying thank you and avoided eye contact. Im disappointed because I live a block away and there are few vegetarian places in the area. But I cant abide by bad service and attitude.   Note: thank you Cassie for trying to fix the situation. We appreciated all you tried to do."}
{"text":"I was nervous about the service situation after reading other reviews but clearly the Pomegranate gang listened to feedback. We were greeted as we walked in and the young lady explained our choices to sit or order at the counter.  The menu was eclectic and had something for everyone as long as no one was dying for bacon. The daily scramble was tasty and filling. Despite the fact I was a square banker in a hippy kingdom, I very much enjoyed the experience and will be back."}
{"text":"Food is good- not the best vegan food I've tried because I've been very a few times and sometimes it's a hit or miss.  Once I got the avocado sandwich and the eggs were pretty oily (I'm hoping it wasn't better). Today, I got the naked burger with the green goddess patty which is yummy but slightly undercooked the potato wedges.  Price- a bit high for the portions (smoothies) and sizes sometimes, however the naked burger plate came with a lot!  I'll still come back but sometimes the food quality varies. Great for vegetarians, vegans or/and anyone interested in trying delicious whole food meals!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would!  Tasty? Indulgent? Doesn't-taste-like-it's-vegi/vegan? Check, Check, Check!!  Honestly I have probably never been more emphatic about a restaurant.  This quaint little shop (although it has been expanded) has a wonderful vibe, and you are able to see just how fresh their food is. Their chalkboard of daily specials welcomes you and their glass-door refrigerators remind you that you are eating fresh, whole, and unaltered vegetables and fruits.  The cashier is knowledgeable, friendly, and greeted with a smiling face.  I ordered the Strawberry Rhubarb French Toast and a cup of the daily soup: Curried Sweet Potato. (I'm a sucker for anything sweet potato.)  I sat down with my number and waited for my food. Both dishes arrived shortly, and my mouth watered at their sight.  The french toast (banana bread with the rhubarb jam and whipped cream) was likely the best french toast I've ever had. I used to have a favorite place for french toast, but this plate left it in the dust. The banana bread was moist, thick, and came with delicious fresh strawberries. Not too sweet, and the light rhubarb jam complemented the thick banana bread to a tee. Unlike other new and healthy restaurants, the portions were not tiny and unfilling. On the contrary, I would think most people would split the order of french toast. I just wish I had come on a day with a special french toast on the menu!  The sweet potato soup was sweet, creamy, and the curry flavors accented it wonderfully.   To finish things off, I couldn't leave without trying one of their tempting cakes! I spoke with one of the owners for a while (who is wonderful), and based on her recommendation I tried the mango and blackberry raw cheesecake. Not only did this cheesecake not taste like it had no dairy, but it likely tops other cheesecakes I have tried.  I can only hope this place stays in business for years to come. When it comes to nutrition, it is vital for restaurants to be completely aware of what they are serving, for them to strive to bring patrons healthy meals, and have fun doing it! Pomegranate Cafe does not fall short; I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Pomegranate 4 or 5 times since it originally opened. I have never, NEVER, gotten my food in under 35 minutes. Keep in mind I generally order for myself, and at most, one other person. Recently I was made to wait nearly an hour for 2 sandwiches. I was one of 3 other people in the restaurant, and I was asked two times after paying what I had ordered. They offered me a \"couple of desserts for the wait.\" Instead I received a single bite sized cookie. The food isn't terrible when they actually make what you ask ( I have asked for no olives on my salads 3 times, and always end up with olives) but it certainly isn't worth the price, or the time it takes. I have wasted several lunch breaks at Pomegranate. I've given this place way too many chances."}
{"text":"I loved this place !!! Food is fresh and delicious!! Menu is original, with many choices to please a family of four! Best cheesecake I had!!! Staff is nice and efficient, and very cool ambiance."}
{"text":"Walked in after I was done visiting the Ace hardware next door. I asked if the lot happened to have a menu that I could take, which if they didn't have I wouldn't have minded, but the hostess/cashier just looked at me with shock and confusion and told me I could look online. I ordered a 5 dollar pomegranate refresher (are you serious about that price?!). Wasn't that impressed with the drink or the service. Won't be back to try this."}
{"text":"Great restaurant concept!  The food was super healthy and very yummy... I'm coming back soon."}
{"text":"Found this awesome spot on my way to Trader Joes. First off, let me just say how impressed I am with the friendliness of the staff. Very trendy ambiance and perfect if you're into natural, healthy, vegan, and local sources."}
{"text":"I am not usually one to post reviews but I just had to say something after my experience here. I was visiting the area and looking for something healthy and new to try so I thought I'd check this place out. Wasn't sure what to order but the girl working, I believe her name was Shannon, recommended the ab&j smoothie. IT WAS AMAZING!! Not only was the smoothie one of the best I've ever had but Shannon was unbelievably friendly and welcoming. I'll be in the area a couple more days and definitely plan on going back because of my experience!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I'm so glad that I work close to a place that serves such delicious veg/vegan food. I have to say, it's pricey for what it is, but if you want to eat well, it's worth it. I had the Kale salad with an organic Arnold Palmer (it's not on the menu--I asked them to mix it for me). Both were delicious. It's one of those places where you pay, get a number, and pick a table where they come bring your food. The staff is very friendly and attentive. They came by a few times to see if I needed anything, and even offered me free refills. I'd come back here any day to try more items on their menu, but I'd probably have to limit it to about once a week. My lunch came out to $18 the last time I was there (not quite sure how though).   Overall, give this great place a shot if you don't mind your wallet taking a little bit of a hit. The veg/vegan options are among the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Who owns this place? Met a friend, was first in line and then watched as a table of 4 and another table of 2 was seated while I waited. I ordered the hummus plate and waited over an hour and 10 minutes. My friend ordered tacos and got those about an hour in. The worst service ever. Food was nothing special. I WILL NOT return and I honestly wonder how they stay open. Lots of bad reviews. They deserve a big fat zero! As a professional I think this is a very poorly managed place with poor communication between staff. Not sure how anything comes together. They need to get a clue!"}
{"text":"Contradiction: A vegan joint in Tukee? Flavorful AND Healthy? Good for you AND fills you up? Healthy pastries and desserts? Yup.   A locally owned restaurant in the middle of a strip mall that looks pro enough that it could be a franchise. But its comfy and calming. Everyone was friendly and helpful and it was nice to see the owner working behind the counter with her troops.   The food: This vegan had the breakfast burritos AND the Philly sandwich. Affordable -- about $10 per dish. Great drinks with juiced veggies and fruits. I had the cucumber celery apple drink called the Refresher. I had the tofu and vegan cheese in my burro which was great. The bread on my Philly was the right texture and everything flavorfully complimented each other. The dishes are creative and unique -- so much more than salads.   She had the french toast with berry compote and real maple syrup and it was all gone pretty quick. Her Adventure drink was very yummy as well.   The vegan chocolate chip cookies were a great way to wrap up the brunch.   I am definitely coming back here again and again. They've only been open since the beginning of the year. They want to expand to organic wines and dinner times. I'm looking forward to that."}
{"text":"You want fresh food and friendly service. Stop by the POM. Had the raw nori az roll and a snickers. Very satisfied. Tons of healthy choices to go around. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The interior looks like a semi-carrying estrogren crashed into the place, I mean it's nice if you are a female or a dad with a daughter who wants to discuss her life problems in a girly environ.  if you aren't and have a pastel phobia, then don't go in, just order out.  on to the food and drinks...our drinks with whisky in it were dope, the water fly cause of the cumber, and the nachos fresh as H E double hockey sticks.  Even the chicken wings were on point- like real but not quite.  Their food deserves an ovation, totally fleck.  Overall it's reps well and I'd go back again...especially at happy hour.  Yo dang ...yo check this out yo, I almost forgot try out their desserts, so yummy.  (See what I mean about the estrogen thing, it's contagious)"}
{"text":"I REALLY want to like this place. I've tried numerous times! Their food is delicious.. especially their cakes, oh my. But seriously, the staff is not the friendliest, (at least the times that I have gone), and the service is extremely slow! :( I just can't get past that. Service is just as important as the food being served!"}
{"text":"There is nothing better than fresh, flavorful and healthy food. My family visit the Ahwatukee area several times a year and this is our favorite place. My husband is here every day. The daily specials are always delicious and the smoothies are our favorites. The Green Warrior is my \"go to\" for breakfast or lunch, and The Cali salad is another meal I look forward to. Come to think of it, I've never had anything at Pomegranate that wasn't superb.  The service here is consistent and caring, and friendly. And- I think it's the best food in the area."}
{"text":"I jumped in here without even realizing much about this café and found it to be so charming! My son and I were both starving and we didn't want to go anywhere else and we are not vegetarians!! So we took the plunge and try to couple different things on the menu and we were both delighted. I have to say I loved the nachos! I would recommend this to anybody who likes food because they take the utmost care to put the right seasoning and the veggie combinations together to make a delightful dinner. Service and atmosphere were amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm not even vegan/vegetarian. But this place is delicious and earthy. Trendy decor and very eclectic range of people. I feel healthier when I eat here. It's just sooo pricey. I get one smoothie, burrito & cookie for $30!!!!  That's a little outrageous. And the service is always SLOW. But friendly!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Tucson and decided to give it a try. The food was completely amazing! Like I told the waiter. It was worth the wait. It was Valentine's Day so it was crazy busy. But I am sure that if we would of come on a regular day we would of had the best time here. The manager was so friendly and and the staff was so kind. We had the raw tacos. And the chicken tacos. Give those a Try! So good!"}
{"text":"Don't get the spicy vegan chicken breakfast burrito. Too hot to taste any other flavor. I think it would have been good otherwise. The hash was great! I liked the cucumber slices in the free water (I am too cheap to buy a juice for 10 bucks). Also, coffee was self serve and we sat outside, so a friend with bad knees passed on buying coffee in light of that journey.  The staff was nice."}
{"text":"This is an example of current high-end dining in the modern world. Forget the expensive snobby restaurants that charge $40 or $50 bucks for an entrée. The intellectual \"earth conscious\" choice for the evolved connoisseur of dining out is vegan.   Wake up to the only way to save humanity. Go vegan."}
{"text":"This is my mom's favorite restaurant in Phoenix so we always make a point to come here from North Phoenix for her birthday/Mother's Day. This year was no exception. We hadn't been in a while so didn't know a) they take reservations and b) they had expanded.   We knew being Mother's Day it would likely be very busy. As expected we walked into a very crowded restaurant. The hostess let us know it would be about 45 mins so we decided to grab a few drinks at the counter. We ordered three different coffee drinks (I forget what they were called but they were very good). Within 10 min of being there they had a table outside for us. We were pleasantly surprised!  They had a specific menu for Mother's Day so we split the mesquite pancakes (huge portions but honestly wasn't my favorite), tacos and burrito (both of those were delicious). Portions are always way bigger than we remember (definitely could have just ordered two meals for the three of us). And desserts are always on point (we typically get something chocolate to take home). We love that most everything is healthy, vegan, organic and gluten-free. We just wish they would open another location in north Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is great, unless you're in a rush. The food is delicious, fresh, organic, and local. It's all vegan and vegetarian fare with lots of gluten-free options. On top of this, everything tastes great.  The biggest drawback is how painfully slow the service is. Getting seated and placing orders takes no time at all, but be prepared to wait a good while for your food to get to you."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here.  It is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.  It's a little nosy inside so I would rather sit outside if it's not too hot or cold.  I'm not really sure how they can make it less noisy.  The chairs and tables and unique which is cool but they wobble sometimes because they are made from different types of material.  All in all, amazing place and I'll make special trips from the west valley just to go here."}
{"text":"I'm have been vegan for many years & am very cautious about GMO's & avoid them at all cost. With that being said, I absolutely love that most everything at Pomegranate Cafe is vegan & organic & bonus stars for the raw options. I went there the first time towards the end of October & I had some kind of a burrito. I ate the whole thing, it was delicious. I then ordered a caramel coconut drink from their coffee menu along with a desert. Everything was delicious. After I was finished m I went to the bathroom to wash my hands & I am not sure what happened but shortly after I came out, I got nauseated. I puked all my lunch which is way odd for me to so b/c I NEVER vomit/puke or anything. Not even when I  sick. Maybe I was so excited I ate too quick & too much? I don't know. Another weird thing that happened was, during our lunch, I asked to keep one of the menus b/c I wanted to continue browsing through (it was my first time there) I was told I couldn't b/c they were short of menus. LOL. Odd. Then a few minutes later she gave me back the menu. Alrighty. Ha!!  My B/F said that we should not come back b/c he was sure it was the food that made me sick but I refused to believe. We went back again a couple of weeks later & I had he raw tacos. They were good. We had a good experience. Except when I ordered my caramel coconut drink from the coffee menu, it didn't taste the same as last time. Like AT ALL. I ended up throwing it away. But, overall, a nice experience.  My 3rd visit just a couple of weeks ago, I ordered the French toast and was very disappointing. There was nothing French toast about this French toast. It was a pastry, like banana bread. Totally didn't even eat it. Had a few bites but that's it. I did order the organic scramble & it was super delicious.  4 stars for now."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Arizona, The staff is lovely and they put so much love in their food I highly recommend to drive to this place even though its miles away! Its worth every dollars you spend. Thank you for making my birthday so special every year"}
{"text":"The wait is always long (no matter what time I go it seems!), but the food is worth the wait. My favorite dish is the vegan nachos...I have gotten it a few times and it never disappoints! Do not come to this restaurant if you are in a rush or have less than an hour to spare, because you will be stressed by the wait. Last two times I've gone, it's been about 1.5 - 2 hrs between arrival time, finally being seated, and then waiting for our order to be taken and then waiting for our order to arrive and finally being able to eat our food."}
{"text":"Fresh organic ingredients, you can't beat. The place is pricey but the quality is there. If you like fresh squeezed juice this is your place, plus the omelets actually have real veggies in them. It's an eclectic spot with good vegan and organic options. The wife luvs the raw desserts..."}
{"text":"Update: Finally came back to try the Mac and Cheez for happy hour and I was pleasantly surprised. I was not expecting it to be the Jalapeño one so when they brought it out I was off guard but it was very delicious! Rick was really friendly and provided great service! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Solid food, I had the breakfast burrito enchilada style. Phenomenal selection vegan food that taste really good. Service was great prompt and timely. What an awesome little café."}
{"text":"This place has a cool ambiance, very modern and a bit hipster. They have cold brew on tap, which is a big plus in my book. the food overall was very average. I had the Arizona wrap and Anna had another wrap. We both thought they were very average at best. The kids had french toast that was very good. I wouldn't come here again unless I was with vegetarians they wanted to come."}
{"text":"This place is simply great. You can tell a lot of love and consideration goes into every meal. They have vegetarian, vegan, and non-vegetarian options for a TONNE of their dishes, and regardless of your preference, you won't be dissatisfied! Go on then, go try it! :)"}
{"text":"First time at this place. One of my daughters who's a vegan recommended it and made reservation for Mother's Day brunch. The place was totally packed and we had to wait a few extra minutes to be sited, but we got a complementary doughnuts hols out of it( the hostess came to us apologizing and offered them to us as a reward for our patience) it was really nice of her.  The food was delicious. The only one who wasn't satisfied was my husband but he is not vegetarian so it doesn't count lol.  Waiter was already kind of tiered on that busy day, which is understandable, there was lots of big parties at the same time. But he was still very pleasant and polite  Overall we had a very nice time and very delicious food for Mother's Day!  Would definitely come back just with my daughter so we can enjoy our vegan food. It is really hard to find a nice place that serves tasty vegetarian/vegan dishes with lots of varieties.  Will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite vegan restaurant ever! Delicious food, locally sourced ingredients, friendly staff, and environmentally conscious owners. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Yet again, Pomegranate did not disappoint! The carrot, strawberry lemonade was fantastic, peach and strawberry pancakes with pecans and soy whipped cream were heavenly, and the veggie wrap with avocados and salsa was exceptional! Service was quick and friendly. Atmosphere relaxing and whimsical. Spot on!  PS. I've noticed some reviewers writing how expensive Pomegranate Cafe is...so I must point out that fresh, locally grown, organic, brilliantly concocted food is never cheap! If you are looking for not organic, not local, not healthy, inexpensive fast food- perhaps go somewhere like MC Donald's."}
{"text":"Very bland and very overpriced. Would not recommend this place.   The service took FOREVER (20mins and you pay at the counter) and the food was entirely trying to be too trendy and lacked in all aspects.  Pass."}
{"text":"My friend and I accidentally came here for brunch after weekend hike. Little did we know it was Vegan/Vegetarian. Now, I'm not Vegan/Vegetarian but am open to trying different things. Everything in this cute little cafe is organic or local bought. I ordered the breakfast burrito and added egg to it. It was filled with egg, black beans, kale, and sweet potato. They gave me a side of tortilla chips and salsa on the side with it. The burrito was just okay. It was wrapped very loosely - Everything was falling out. The beans were undercooked and hard. If I didn't add the egg, I don't think it would have really tasted like a burrito at all. The fresh apple slices on the side of my plate were soggy, old and seemed like it was soaked in lemon water for days. My friend ordered one of their sandwiches. It looked much more appetizing.   Our server was friendly and happy, just slow.   Environment: 5/5 Food: 2/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"I was so happy to hear Pomegranate was opening a central Phoenix location! They did a great job putting this restaurant together.   They have one of the best pastry cases at all times, full of vegan/gluten free goodness!! Along with their coffee menu, it's the perfect place to grab a drink and a treat.   I have been here for breakfast and lunch, and fully enjoyed every meal. The raw bagel sandwich is one of my favorites, their salads and wraps are also delicious! Today I got an iced super food hot chocolate (my favorite drink here, usually add coconut whip cream on top) and a Brazilian nut raw cacao brownie. I was so satisfied with both orders, the brownie was sweet but not overly sweet and had a great texture.   Service was very friendly! Asked a few times how we were doing as we sat and enjoyed our treats and came around with water promptly. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent but pretty long wait for two bowls.  The quality and freshness was on point.  Prices are high but this isn't fast food or some franchise with pre-packaged heat and serve meals."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome.  I can't believe I have waited this long to make a review.  I am super lucky as I own a building down the street that I have to manage on a regular basis.  I always am stopping by here to get breakfast, lunch, a drink in between meals.  I've had a lot on the menu but some of the highlights are the tamale pie, the raw tacos are delish, the kale and cobb salads are great.  The drink menu is also plentiful, some of my favorites are the green abundance drink and the green coffee drink with berries.  The breakfast burritos are also filling and really fresh.  The prices are more expensive than other places but when you look at the quality of the food and care that goes into making their dishes it's totally worth it.  The only thing I would knock them on ( and I won't because the food is 6 stars) is the time it takes to get your order.  I've also been given other people's orders by mistake.  They are always nice about it but as they have become more popular over the years they seem to have a hard time keeping up.  Oh and lastly the deserts are really good and reasonably priced considering they are raw and generous portions.  I take them to go and they go a long way to satisfy a sweet tooth cravings you may have.  In my case I don't normally have deserts but I don't miss having one here.  They are fantastic.  I am super happy to support this place and hope they keep doing well as there is no substitute out there."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, but I thoroughly enjoyed the tempeh bacon in my Lumberjack sandwich I had for brunch.  I got the side of potatoes with the pomegranate BBQ, but I wasn't a fan of the sauce.  I switched it out for the spicy \"cheese\" dipping sauce, much better.  It was a great breakfast, I'd def go back there again."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Pomegranate Cafe in a while. but was really craving a Cassie latte. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw how much they had grown! I was so overwhelmed but one of the pastry chefs walked me through the menu and the yummy pastry case. She helped me find the most healthy options for my needs. She was very patient and knowledgeable.  I will be sure to go back more often now!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! It really overexceeded my expectations, everything on the menu sounded delicious and unfortunately I could only choose one thing! I came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty crowded but it took no time to get us seated. I got French toast and pineapple melon lemonade and it was amazing!! My only complaint is that the prices are crazy expensive, $6 for the lemonade and $12 for the French toast! I suppose this is the price you pay for a quality meal, but make sure your wallet is prepared!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the food was AMAZING. The service on the other hand was terrible. Our server was rude. She had a stale face from beginning to end. We went to pay and were inquiring about the desserts and my friend asked what flavor of cake there was. In a rude tone she stated that they closed an hour ago and the pastry chef was gone, so we couldn't buy any. We understand you're trying to close but when there are still three other tables who just got their meals, you would think that she would  be able to answer a simple question. To top it off she kept rolling her eyes. I don't think I will ever come back here. This was absolutely ridiculous. It pained me to even leave a tip for such a sourpuss."}
{"text":"I have been an infrequent customer (due to the location) for almost five years.  Back then, they had odd hours, small staff, but the food was beyond belief.  I recall the best vegan nut nog possible. The high prices were worth the months of fond food recollection. I decided the other day to order one to go, however, this time the nog was bitter, chunky, and a complete waste of $8.  I threw it in the garbage once I got home. I have noticed other menu items that no longer meet the praise I have been dishing out to my friends so I will stop recommending your restaurant. I'm sure there is still plenty of good food but this is supposed to be THE place for food purists, IMO.    UPDATE  I'm happy to report that on subsequent visits since my mediocre review last year I have been generally very happy with this restaurant. They made my last complaint right and I support their mission to creat great vegan food. I can't give 5 stars yet because I feel portion sizes for the price are a little small but I'm glad Pomegranate is around supporting local foodies.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"So, I'm a carnivore, or at least I thought I was.  Never in my life would I have thought food that had no meat in it could be this darn good.  I have had the Lumberjack and the Dragon bowl and loved them both.  The staff is always friendly, despite my many, many questions.  I tried this place because of all the great reviews and wanted to be opened minded.  I am blown away guys, thanks for showing me that meatless meals can be filling, satisfying, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Pomegranate is my favorite restaurants. I am consistently impressed by the high quality of their foods, the different specials, the customer service, and the atmosphere. As a vegan, it is hard to find restaurants to eat at, and even harder to find ones that are packed full of whole food ingredients and made on-site. An example of their exceptional customer service was on this past Mother's Day, when we did not have a reservation (and the restaurant was packed), but the workers made a point to help us find a place to sit anyways and were very accomodating to my mother's food allergies.   My last visit, I shared an amazing slice of chocolate cake (very rich and surprisingly like the non-vegan variety), two delicious juices, the raw tacos, and a loaded baked potato quesadilla. Both entrees came with an amazing kale salad. In the past, I have had brunch and dinner.   If you are looking for a healthy, satisfying (you won't leave hungry) and appropriately priced (when you consider the value you get) meal, come to Pomegranate!"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. I'm not Vegan but have an autoimmune disorder and try to eat plant based as much as possible. I have been to the Central Phoenix location twice in the last week and had two different entrees and one dessert. I can say that it was all delicious with no associated guilt. One entree is two complete meals for me. The portions are not skimpy.   After reading the reviews, I had to chuckle at the comments: the gravy that tasted like cashews and although not liking cashews the person still orders it and was disappointed it tasted like cashews and not actual non-vegan gravy; the walnuts that don't taste identical to actual meat; a vegan restaurant that doesn't cater to carnivores, but you still decided to go and were upset that there was no actual meat on the menu.  To clarify, this is a VEGAN restaurant besides the few dishes that you can get with eggs. If you love plant based food that tastes great, this is your place. If you are looking to eat meat or food that is not plant based, or want junk-food and/or bar food, it's probably not the place for you. Trust me, we all want a cheat meal here and there.  I am seriously grateful to have this place in my neighborhood, because it makes it easy for me to stick to my dietary restrictions when I don't feel like cooking, or if I want to eat out and not modify everything on the menu to exclude dairy, wheat, gluten, etc..."}
{"text":"Two words... FUDEGE PEPPERMINT PANCAKES!  Oh wait, that's three. My friend and I went for their extended brunch menu and it was the special. You know me, mint and chocolate are bffs when together. It was absolutely delicious.   I appreciate they have vegan options, yet, offer real eggs for omnivores like me. Also, had a pear sangria type of drink and posted a picture. Super cute pear wedge that is heart shaped too.   Def want to be back asap!"}
{"text":"Brunch was wonderful.  I love that there are so many choices for vegans for breakfast. All of the baked goods are vegan, too!"}
{"text":"So I've never found this restaurant by searching for local vegan places but it did come up because my co-worker was frazzled and needed WiFi if he was going to eat lunch. My being Vegan, this worked out really well.  He had the elephant bowl and a green apple lime refresher.  He was happy with both, the food is pricey but the quantity is good for 2 servings. I had the bountiful bowl which was a little bland but they have some nice hot sauce which spiced it right up.  The quinoa was cooked just right and I was very satisfied with my meal.  We will definitely go again, the Wifi was good too!"}
{"text":"Love the energy & food. I need to go here more often! Service is spectacular! I could definitely become a regular. I love that they have coconut cream for the nitrous coffee... Keep up the PALEO options!"}
{"text":"My husband n I are visiting the area. Decided to try it out. Well all we tried was the water. The waiter was to busy talking to coworkers to ask if we would like coffee or smithing else to drink. He said \"oh your first time here, I will be back\". Leaves water n walks off to chat with coworkers. After a good 5 Minutes n no acknowledgment from anyone we walked out. According to my daughter in law they also had bad service there in November and didn't care for the food. So I guess he saved us from this over priced restaurant."}
{"text":"I would have rated this a 5* if not for the prices. The food is tasty & delicious & presented nicely, the atmosphere is casual, trendy, bright & cheerful. I love this place because it is vegan/vegetarian. We had 4 different meals between us and 2 smoothies and dessert to go. Everything was wonderful and the service was prompt & pleasant. We will come back for special occasions, but due to the prices ($10-12 for a smoothie, $25-30 per person), we won't be regulars."}
{"text":"My friend took me here. It's vegan and organic. The food here is phenomenal. We came for brunch, You can't go wrong with any entrée you get really. The pancakes here are so fluffy and so filling. Make sure you share, it's big. Oh and the Chilliquiles. Omg. It was AMAZING. Blue chips, beans, tofu and HOT SAUCE ON TOP. oh yessss. I wouldn't mind eating this for breakfast lunch and dinner.   They have great pastries here as well. Kinda sweet for my taste buds but when I do... it's good.  But why is it so farrrr. lol. The 20 min drive is worth it though."}
{"text":"Great place, atmosphere and customer service. The food was really amazing especially their drinks! If you ever go or live in Arizona I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really good. Will come again. One star off for the confusing order counter vs. sit down."}
{"text":"I still love the food at Pomegranate. It is by far some of the best vegan food around. That gets 5 stars from me.   The service though really can be frustrating. I have been coming here a lot on the past year and service seems really hit or miss.  The food always brings me back, but I think the food saves them. Based on service I probably would have stopped coming.   There seems to be a lot of confusion with the staff. Incorrect to go orders, bringing me my cheesecake to go while I'm waiting outside and telling me that the rest of my food is going to be 15 minutes. Can you imagine what 15 minutes outside waiting in 100 degrees will do to my dessert?  Um it's going to melt.    Staff is trying, but not all of them seem like they have a clue. It comes off as too chill, too hippy dippy, not professional, and less than a 5 star worthy rating.  I want to see them take it up a notch and have the quality of service match the food."}
{"text":"So... I think Pomegranate and I might have more than a spring fling. I don't want to jinx it, but this could be really serious. I introduced Pomegranate to my mom, my best friends, and even my current boyfriend, but everyone agrees, they can see me spending the rest of my life with Pomegranate. Here's my recount of our classic love story, one dish at a time.  I knew I'd fallen after tasting the Strawberry Rhubarb French Toast (griddle-dipped banana bread, drizzled in rhubarb sauce, strawberries, and topped with cream) Then, the Tiramisu (coconut-based espresso, cream, and date-nut crust layers) sent me head over heels. The Breakfast Burrito left me satisfied, but didn't create that same spark that the flavorful Ranchero Skillet once did. Luckily, the hemp milk latte and famous cowgirl cookie quickly helped me remember why I committed to Pomegranate in the first place.  Our relationship moved to a new level - raw - a few months ago. The rainbow wrap was ridiculously huge and filling (much more so than the basic, but tasty, Mediterranean wrap). It was almost more than I could handle. I tossed the bland Indian sweet potato hummus it came with and focused on what really mattered... finishing the wrap. I cared too much not to. After stuffing myself into oblivion, Pomegranate surprised me with a coffee-choco-nana & coconut milk ice cream shake afterward... topped with crushed chocolate-almond pillows. Within seconds of my first spoonful, the fire was back, and burning hotter than ever.  Shortly afterwards, I fell into a confused rut, messing around with vegan meats and cheeses of all varieties. The southwestern mac 'n' cheese, much like the Philly cheese steak, tantalized me with its decadence, but left me feeling sick and low afterwards. Even the delicious, nutritious teriyaki chicken bowl, brimming with sprouts, veggies and quinoa, was only posing as Mr. Right. Tainted by the presence of faux-chicken, I shied away after only two rendezvouses. Not even dessert could lure me back, for both the chocolate cake (dry) and almond butter square (boring) were a disappointment.  It was all my fault. What was I thinking? A few weeks later, I rushed back, determined to mend the gaping hole in my heart. I downed the mushroom bisque and half a pesto presto sandwich (Kamut baguette, fresh avocado, pesto, fresh veggies) in under five minutes. Oh, how I missed the fresh ingredients, the whole foods, the homemade flavor in every bite. Still, I needed some sugar after being away. Lucky for me, the Cannoli (brûlée'd sugar shell, cashew cream filling, dark chocolate chips, and berry sauce), not only provided that, but was better than any Cannoli I'd ever had. And I've had a fair share of Cannolis in my day. What more can a girl ask for?   Pomegranate, I do."}
{"text":"Sarah H and I came in for lunch today because we've been both wanting to try it for a while.  The restaurant was bustling when we arrived so we waited line and ordered our lunch.  I settled on the Elephant Curry Bowl, recommended by the cashier and Sarah ordered the Daily Burger which was a sweet potato burger today and a pomegranate lemonade.  We took our table market and found a place to sit and chatted while we waited for our food.    Her lemonade came out first.  It looked like the pomegranate was fresh squeezed.  I forget her exact words but something like it was interesting.  She drank most of it, but not all.  Also, the glass of lemonade was on the small side.  Not what I would expect for $3.  Our meals came out and my Elephant Bowl looked good.  Yellow curry with lots of fresh vegetables and brown rice and tofu.  Everything I like.  Maybe I should have just ended the meal there before the disappointment set in. For a curry it was terribly bland and strangely enough made my tongue numb.  I ended up bringing the majority of it home and spiced it up a bit so I could finish it.  I had a bite of Sarah's burger and it was pretty good.  It tasted predominately of sweet potatoes and lentils, but I enjoy both of those.  She had the root vegetable fry's on the side and those were good as well seasoned with rosemary.    I would like to try this place again.  I noticed that many of the reviews were not good for many's first visit but then improved with their second.  It might be good for Abu J with his vegan/supermodel diet.  I'm curious what he'll think of it."}
{"text":"bomb Spaghetti Squash, Mermaid Salad, and burgers!  Also, the PomMilk is delish! Tried the superfood hot chocolate, but found it very thick and too spicy. Regardless, the food was super tasty and had great ingredients."}
{"text":"Creative and great food. I went to several vegetarian restaurants in the area and this was the best so far. I plan on going back several times before I leave. The food is presented in a colorful and beautiful way and tastes great."}
{"text":"Great customer service, beautiful decor, nice greek / american style menu. Visited here for business trip, will definitely return before the trip is over."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to love Pomegrante Cafe, but I have always had hit or miss food and/or service, so I never bothered to return after spring 2013.   In February 2016, after a near 3 year hiatus, I finally gave them another go.  I tried the raw tacos, a couple of street tacos, and a burger slider from their happy hour menu.  The raw taco, served with walnut \"meat\" was pretty tasty.  Everything else was just ok, and I found pieces of real cheese on my vegan plate, so I was thinking it may be another 3 years before I returned.  However, recently they posted items from their Summer 2016 menu, and I was enticed by their new banana split and hush puppy offerings.  I figured if I keep giving them chances, it'll eventually pay off.    We went during happy hour (which is 3pm-6pm, Mondays through Saturdays) on Friday, 29July16, and ordered a bunch of different things.  TEPARY I'ITOI HUSH PUPPIES - $12: I believe that hush puppies are a southern dish (but I won't swear to that), and from where I come, we love them.  They are fried balls of cornmeal/bread, mixed with onions and sometimes peppers.   My mistake was expecting these to taste like homemade southern hush puppies; they didn't. In their own right, they are pretty good, just not what I was expecting or wanting. Try them for yourself; you may love them! Over-priced.   TU-NUT SALAD SANDWICH - $14:  I omitted the sunflower ranch and tomatoes.  I enjoyed this dish. It was a tasty vegan tuna salad version on warm toasty bread. Only some vegan mayo spread on the bread would make it better. The seasonal side was potato salad, and theirs is pretty good.  Organic or not, for the portion, it was not worth $14; $10 maybe, but not $14.   GILA MONSTER NACHOS - $8 (HAPPY HOUR PRICE): This colorful dish comes with a huge heaping of corn chips, walnut taco \"meat\", beans, jalapeño, pico, and guacamole (I omitted the queso and sour cream, but the 1st order came out with both, so they had to remake it).  A deliciously satisfying dish which is large enough to share, although you may not want to. The regular price is $12. I would return for this dish any time of the day.  POM BANANA SPLIT - $10: Sliced banana coins, vegan vanilla ice cream scoops, chocolate syrup, caramel, brownies, and coconut whip cream. The description includes a Pomberry syrup, but I didn't see anything resembling berries or berry syrup. This dish was pretty darn good, but it could've been great if the ice cream didn't taste freezer-burnt. Also, the brownie had nuts in it, and this was not mentioned in their menu description.  Luckily, I am not allergic, but those with nut allergies should remember to always ask, as even the healthiest food venues don't always consider allergies when writing their menus.  Being that this dish is large enough to share, $8-$10 seems fair if it's in a perfect state (ice cream not icy and all described ingredients included).    DD got the Maca Magic Smoothie ($10), Napoleon Grilled Cheese Sandwich, with real cheese ($15!!), and the Root Beer float ($10).  She enjoyed the smoothie and drank almost all of it.  She didn't like that grilled cheese sandwich one bit and wasted my $15.  The Root Beer float was a hit; it came with 3 scoops of ice cream and a full bottle of root beer for her to pour herself.  Personally, I think the smoothie and root beer floats should be about $7-$8 each, not $10. The grilled cheese was completely over-priced.    My cousin ordered the BUFFALO HOT WINGS ($10), JAMAICAN CURRY WEDGES ($8 on HH menu; $12 regular price), BBQ Buffalo Wrap ($14), Macro Bowl ($14), Hibiscus Cooler ($6), and a Banana Split as well.  She absolutely loved every single thing that she got, which proves, to each his own.   I tried her Buffalo Hot Wings. The buffalo sauce on the wings was good, but I didn't like the texture of their wings.  She loved them.  I also tried the Jamaican Curry Wedges... LOL! No. I was expecting hella spice and flavor, but as colorful as was the presentation, it failed to deliver. Maybe under another name they wouldn't have been so disappointing? They were not bad, just not what I expected, given the name.  They certainly are not worth the $12 regular menu price. Try for yourself during HH, and save yourself $4.    Even though I wasn't 100% happy with everything, I can appreciate that the food was fresh, filling, and quite tasty.  Table service by Brittany was excellent. She was friendly and attentive without being over-present.    The main downfall, aside from location, is that they are just too expensive. If you get a drink, appetizer, main course and dessert, you're already at $50 per person! This isn't New York and they shouldn't be charging Phoenicians that much, organic or not."}
{"text":"We enjoy the food and ambience. However, recently with breakfast or dinner, it's been long waits to get our food. This wasn't the case before. My wife and I are becoming discouraged about coming here because of the long waits."}
{"text":"We got the Athens Salad and Wild West Tacos. Both were amazing ! My favorite brunch items."}
{"text":"Great food! Great staff. Highly recommend if you're looking for a healthy food option in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I came in to grab lunch but only had 30 minutes so ordered it to go.   There were a number of people waiting for their to-go orders when I arrived.   After I ordered it soon became apparent that the others had been waiting quite a while and had to keep asking for an ETA on their order.   My order took over 30 minutes to appear and when it did, the to-go container was really dirty.   It appeared to have avocado (???) and something orange-brown smeared on the outside of the box.   When I commented on how bad the box looked the hostess offered to re-wrap my food but by this time I was already late for my meeting.  The smeared food on the container turned me off to the point I didn't even eat the food I ordered.   For a $14 sandwich this was a major fail."}
{"text":"Ahwatukee needs more great businesses just like this one.  Fresh, progressive, customer focused and a can't go wrong menu."}
{"text":"The Pomegranate Cafe is delicious! I love the GF mac n cheese, and the other day I shared an amazing pesto quesadilla on a GF tortilla with vegan cheese with my friend, it was incredible! Pricey but totally worth the trip! Great service and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are delicious here but the food takes FOREVER. It's consistently INCREDIBLY slow even when the place is pretty much barren. I don't understand why it takes so long but I wouldn't come here unless you have 2 hours to eat/waste."}
{"text":"Omg I don't think words can ever describe how thankful and how happy this place makes me. Everything on the menu is absolutely incredible and don't get me started with their seasonal cakes. Man I don't know how they do it! This place makes a vegan go nuts, it will also make someone that isn't a vegan consider it!!! Incredible my favorite place."}
{"text":"I need to go back to this place to really rate them accurately. All I had here was a cowboy bar, and unfortunately, I wasn't a huge fan. It looks like a chocolatey delicious bar and was highly recommended by the staff, but it tasted like oatmeal or something....an overwhelming odd flavor, especially in the after taste. It was 5$ and the husband and I didn't eat it all, so it wasn't a great value. I noticed other items were also very expensive, they had a juice that cost 9$...whoa.  I would want to try other things here, but so far, I'm not totally convinced."}
{"text":"Love this place. The vlt is my fav. The cowgirl cookies are the bomb."}
{"text":"I agree with others who have said that it is a tremendously rough start for this location.    First, the physical space looks fantastic--big, open, airy, bright.   Second, I love what they're trying to do!  Sustainable food, not a lot of fake, overly processed fake meats, etc.   But basically everything else this morning was a bust.  After being seated, we waited TEN MINUTES for our drink order to be taken--without water on the table, even.  It was a Sunday morning and steadily busy but in no way slammed.  Multiple servers walked past us multiple times.  Eventually, when my husband's coffee was brought the server said, \"We're making a new pot but this is what was left in the old one\" and put down a cup about 1/3 full.  After lots of waiting, I feel like we could have certainly waited five more minutes rather than getting the dregs.   Then, she couldn't explain to me why the biscuits and gravy had to come with egg or tofu--and the menu made them (eggs/tofu) sound like a side. When they came, I liked my meal but my husband...who ordered the seasonable scramble did NOT.    Really steep prices as well.   He tried to order a $13 mimosa (on the menu) but was told they don't have their liquor license yet.  Fine, but maybe don't put it on the menu.  The people sitting next to us ended up leaving after the first two things they ordered were not available!  We're so sad about this and likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Soooo, this is one of my favorite places to eat in the Phoenix area and have watched it grow almost since it's inception...Food is always super fresh and delicious! Sometimes the food has taken a bit, but well worth the wait.  Plus they started bringing out chips and salsa which made me almost forget I had food coming because the salsa was SO good.  Needless to say I have brought many friends/family/carnivores here and NOT ONE of them was disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Ahwatukee. Only down side is its expensive. But you get great food and s large quantity.  Their homemade desserts are amazing as is everything I have tried there."}
{"text":"We just switched to vegan/plant-strong, so we were excited (and perhaps a bit hesitant) to attempt our first outing into the world of not being in control of cooking our own food. This visit left me comforted that there was at least one excellent vegan restaurant nearby ... AND affirmed our decision to embrace this new way of eating!   I'll start out with the one (potential) negative for us -- it was on the pricey side. My wife and I eat had a standard lunch entree (me -- Elephant Curry Quinoa/Tofu Bowl; her -- Tacos Vivas & Kale Salad), and we shared a smoothie of the day (Blood-Builder -- beet, carrot, OJ, mango, pineapple), and the ticket was $30+. Now, I'm not complaining - it was wonderful food (see my much longer list of positives below!) and huge portions, but still a bit more than I would have typically expected to pay for a weekday lunch for 2. Perhaps -- and I can probably believe it -- vegan/vegetarian is going to consistently cost us more now when we go out ... and if so, and if you're used to this, then this pricing probably wasn't out of the ballpark at all. So, with that in mind, and assuming this to be the case, I didn't let this negatively impact my rating. Will we be back?! Undoubtedly, and most likely often!   Now, for the positives!   Great atmosphere -- Very inviting. Casual and informal. We visited at what was probably the height of the lunch rush on a Friday. Pretty consistent traffic, and tables were available but at a premium. A little loud, but comfortable and simply attributable to people enjoying their meals and each other's company.   Excellent menu -- I was impressed with the variety offered. Choices were described creatively and yet were easily understood. Even us newbie vegans had some questions, though, and the staff were quick to answer and provide input. Granted, it was our first visit, but I really had difficulty deciding what to order, as many options intrigued me. I was completely satisfied with my final choice (Elephant Curry Tofu Bowl) -- hit the spot on a chilly January day in Phoenix! A HUGE selection of smoothies, including a couple of-the-day options. We passed on dessert, but the display case was filled with enticing options, too!   Portion size/value -- My wife and I both were impressed with the portion size. I finished mine (no surprise) but probably could have stopped sooner and been satisfied (did I mention it was SO good, though?!). Her purple-cabbage-bowl tacos were even larger, however, and absolutely overflowing with walnut meat, greens, avocado, and a spicy baja sauce. (Can't wait to test out the walnut \"meat\" with our girls soon...!) She had to leave most of one behind (yes, she did offer it to me, but even I was too stuffed by this point.   Visual appeal -- Everything in the place screamed \"fresh\" and \"healthy\" and \"natural\"! From what ended up on our table (the bright yellow of my curry, the rich purple of my wife's cabbage bowls, and the vibrant magenta of our beet smoothie), to what kept distracting me as they were delivered to a nearby table (huge, freshly layered burgers, piled-high sandwiches, other multi-hued smoothies), and the little peeks behind the counter to the cooler filled with fresh produce and the boatload of fresh veggies and fruit that kept going into the juicer/blender. It really was a smorgasbord for the senses. (My wife and I laughed about previous visual experiences at other \"restaurants\" like Taco Bell, Olive Garden, etc. ... so sad what we've contented ourselves with as a culture.)   Fun factor -- Again, the place was fun and kitschy. Nothing fancy, but clean and bright and full of life. Smoothies are all served in mason-jar-like containers. Tables and chairs are an eclectic mishmash. Self-serve flavored water (cucumber+carrot, I believe?) was a nice touch.   All in all, I loved it. I left feeling good about my meal, good about how I had just invested my time and resources, good about supporting people who obviously cared about what and how they invest in their world, and good about our decision to change the way we eat/live.   Already looking forward to our next visit! (And maybe also to taking a swing at mimicking that curry bowl here at home ... wish me luck!!)"}
{"text":"My cousin introduced me to Pomegranate and now I'm moving to AZ and into the neighborhood so I can regularly get my fix. I love eating and then feeling amazing afterward and that's what happens here.   Follow them on Facebook if you dare ... it will give you cravings like you won't believe! Everything looks amazing and tastes even better! Fresh, crisp, fruity, savory - whatever you're in the mood for they've got it.   My favorites: the everything \"bagel\", the daily quesadilla, and the homemade snickers bar. YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is worth coming to check out! Very nice atmosphere and good quality food. You don't have to be vegan to enjoy the Pom Burger. I also got the young americano, very tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is a vegan's dream come true! Everything on the menu is vegan by default and if you want dairy, you have to request it! the menu is pretty sizeable and includes everything from french toast for breakfast to some sweet treats for dessert! I had the Chick-un wrap which comes with a vegan aioli and some really delicious marinated kale, avocado, and a bunch of other yummy stuff. For dessert I gave their cheesecake a try, which was....eh. I also had their version of an almond joy which was awesome! They also have some pretty delcious looking cookies. The service was good and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm in love! Their brunch options are fabulous for vegans (yay for me!) and omnivores (yay for most people I take with me!). I am crazy about the Lumberjack breakfast sandwich with tofu and vegan cheese, their breakfast burrito is amazing and kept me full all day. I try to get there once a week at least and always treat myself to one of their yummy vegan desserts. The raw cheesecake is to die for, their cupcakes are fantastic (I even got some from their wonderful pastry chef for my birthday and they were a HUGE hit with friends). I can't recommend them enough!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  The food is wonderful and the service is friendly and helpful.  They are passionate about the product and it really shows.   The atmosphere is very bright and cheerful.  Left here feeling full and happy!"}
{"text":"Ok so I've been back here several times. Still love it. Their daily specials are amazing, I love the rotating sides and smoothies. They have a green smoothie (can't remember the name) that is amazing! I took my mom here for Mother's day and they gave all the mom's mimosas :) love it. I just wish they weren't so spendy... I'm but a poor college student, trying to eat vegan when I can!"}
{"text":"Pomegranate's is a really awesome vegetarian/vegan place, even for us meat eaters out there.  They really do a fantastic job of keeping their food flavorful and interesting, it almost makes including meat in your food seem like cheating.  I had the supreme burrito and have to recommend it as it really was delish.  While the menu may seem daunting at first and all the 'meat' in quotes seems odd, you get over it real quick once you get your food and get a taste.  If you are like me and tend to stay away from vegan places, this is defiantly the one to risk it at!  The coffee here is also good.  Now that we've had many years of the Starbucks $5 espresso drinks, the price point seems reasonable and you will find much better quality here than at a mass market place.  They also have some really interesting vegan 'cream' that is quite good.  Also, good hint for those looking for food they will recognize.  Head over before 2pm for breakfast/brunch.  Their egg based dishes are excellent, tasty and completely reasonable for those seeking traditional protein.  Only warning, the price point is a little above our normal range!  It just seems like more of a $12 instead of $18 place to me, but not enough to knock it down a star since you won't be able to find a legit comparison point.  It really is unique so give it a try and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  The service was horrible!  One waitress for the entire restaurant...although it was not packed it was too much for one person.  She had zero sense of urgency.... she was very sweet, but it was not a good experience.  It took forever for our (two) drinks to be made and when we finally did get them... the wine was in a dirty glass... I had to take it up to the bar myself as the waitress was taking forever to get back to our table. When we finally did get our food (it was worth the wait) but the poor service was definitely the down side of the evening.  This place could be fabulous... but they have to step up their service!"}
{"text":"Im not vegan or vegetarian but I just might be someday because of this cafe. Curious about all types of cuisine, I gave Pom a try one day a few years ago and I have been back several times since. They even deserve some credit for inspiring me to eat healthier and switch to mostly plant based proteins. Above all else, their food is just really tasty. Everything is from scratch and is well seasoned and flavored - not something you find very much in this city unfortunately. Even as a meat eater their food is so good that I never feel like I am missing it. They do serve eggs and dairy cheese for breakfast if you prefer. The breakfast burrito here is one of the best I've had. Can't recommend Pom enough, just wish it was cheaper."}
{"text":"I am from out of town staying in lovely AZ for 3 months so it has been fun to explore the different food offering that this sunny state offers.  Pomegranate has to be one of my favorites.  I am on a strict diet of no sugar, gluten, dairy, grains, beans, etc. so mainly a vegan diet (doctor ordered) so finding this gem was a god sent.  My first time at the cafe I had an Athena Wrap which was actually suppose to be a bowl since I cant have grains but that was my fault because you are given options of either a grain wrap, collard leaf wrap or in a bowl  I forgot to order the bowl, it still was really good.  The lemon bar made with xylitol was a good no sugar dessert option and surprisingly sweet tasting.   Second time in,  I order the POM \"nut cheese\" plate and the Raw Everything Bagel (the bagel being made from nuts and vegies).  There was so much food I could not eat it all and I really tried.  The POM cheese plate offer three different types of cheeses all made from nuts.  There was a cheddar rolled in walnuts, herb and spreadable almond cheese that didn't have a name but was delish.  It was served with various fresh vegetables, flax seed crackers and strawberries.  The Raw Everything Bagel sandwich was a nut and vegie made bagel with loads grated carrots, cabbage, sunflower sprouts and a almond ranch dressing spread. It was tasty but my only complaint and it is a common complaint of many restaurants is that stack the fillings so high that it is impossible to actually take a bite of your sandwich without everything falling out all over the place.  I ended up just pulling it apart and eating with a knife and fork to cut down on the mess.  I walk out with my doggie bags and a very satisfied belly and no guilt."}
{"text":"Ordered and they forgot about our order. Took more than 30 minutes to get food. But once the food came it was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Well, my partner and I have been waiting around 45 minutes for two wraps and quite frankly that's ridiculous. It doesn't matter how good the food will be, we won't be returning. Another table of two got their food before us and they came after. One of your servers came around 15 minutes ago to tell us our food would be our shortly. I don't know how you folks run your business, but it seems like slow service is the \"it\" thing around here.  *Update*  Food was good. Our lunch experience was an arrival of 12:45. We got our food at 1:30, my partner asked for no onions in his wrap, it came with onions. We waited another 10 minutes for his wrap to come back. We finally ate and asked for the check which took another 10 minutes to run the card.   Overall 4/5 for food 2/5 for experience."}
{"text":"I've been to pomegranate cafe twice now and I am for sure going back. I had no idea I lived so close to a vegan restaurant that also has raw-vegan options and I'm so happy this place is delicious!  I got the mermaid salad last night to go and though the tofu was rather over cooked and a bit too salty the rest of the salad was delightful. I'm a bit of a salt fiend but I think next time I'll order this salad sans the tofu.   This morning I dined in for a late breakfast with my non-vegan boyfriend. I had the Pomuffin and he had the Avocado Sandwich and he actually enjoyed it! We both appreciated the freshness and portion sizes. The drip coffee is really great, I can't wait to try the lattes and desserts next time."}
{"text":"Not for me thank you food not up to expectations.   Two visits neither time was I impressed.   Actually I was disappointed.  Service was fine I counted ten people behind the counter.  Not sure there was more than ten customers.  My wife felt the food was fine but commented that we didn't need to come back again.  Price seemed high."}
{"text":"This place is very cute, the food is great, and the staff are friendly. My wife had an avocado egg sandwich and loved it. A couple of times the coffee alternative was watery and bland, however my daughter and I shared a smoothie and we both enjoyed it. Overall a great place."}
{"text":"After a couple of visits and a strong hope for the start of a loyalty punch card program since I plan on returning for breakfast every weekend, I feel I can confidently give PomCafe 5 stars. The food and atmosphere satisfy everything I look for in a cute, neighborhood cafe that is trying to promote not only health but the idea that health tastes GREAT.   The buckwheat english muffin has sent me on a frenzy to find a recipe and bake it myself at home because it was perfect for that lumberjack sammie. The raw collard wrap I had for lunch today was an unexpected slam dunk - hello almond cheese! And I second other reviewer's prop for the orange juice. I want to buy a juicer now.  Answer your temptation at the raw bakery, trust me. Though the only semblance the raw donuts have of a real one is the shape, they still taste delicious. Chocolate cherry \"cheese\" cake? One of my co-diners actually had dessert for breakfast because it was too hard to pass up.  So far I have found no reason to dock points. I will keep returning though with solid determination to get to the bottom of each plate in search of any hint of disappointment. I'm fairly certain I won't find it though."}
{"text":"They must have something against ice because our water was warm and gross, even when they refilled it. The food was incredibly overpriced and funky (the morning egg scramble flavor was orange chicken - wtf?) Service was slow, even when there was only one other table with customers. The interior was nice and I've heard great things, but I was highly disappointed. I'm sticking to Green and Nami for vegan options in Phoenix."}
{"text":"As most reviews of this place state, the food is fresh, healthy and amazing. For us gluten-free seekers, there are many options that satisfy on the menu. The inside is large and spacious, casual. Service is not great, but this place also gets pretty busy around lunchtime. If you don't like vegan or vegetarian, this is not the place for you! There are no chicken sandwiches or turkey burgers here! I love the fresh smoothies, but they are quite pricey. Smoothies come in a mason size jar with a straw so this means you're getting a very small glass for about $8. But it's one of the only places of it's kind in our area. So if fresh, different and healthful is what you are craving, you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Pomegranate never disappoints.  Get onto the vegan and raw vegan deserts.  Pomegranate cake will blow your mind.  And the Almond Joys are awesome.  You'll never know they are almost healthy!"}
{"text":"Due to business in Phoenix, I came across this place through a yelp search (what else), and was so happy after my first visit that I came back a second time on my departure day, grabbed dinner and had them pack me something as an in-flight meal.  They offer a great selection of vegan and raw vegan food, and while the vegan choices do offer a few comfort food items for the meat-eating-boyfriend-types, most of the menu is fairly healthy. As a mostly raw vegan, I did appreciate their raw selections, although I admit I went weak and had to try their daily burger, which was absolutely delicious!  They also have an eclectic dessert selection, which I resisted, but looked splendid.  I am sure that I will return here anytime I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I personally absolutely adore this place. The food takes your tastebuds on a ride they are probably not ready for. The staff are always there to ensure you have everything you need and never wrong on a good recommendation. Usually when people ask me for a recommendation for a decent place to eat, it's almost Pomegranate Cafe every time."}
{"text":"Gluten free, vegan paradise!   If I could afford to eat here every day, I'm pretty sure I would... I haven't been disappointed yet!   The only negative critique I have is that it can be a bit too pricey for my wallet, but the quality is great!"}
{"text":"**Bumping this down a notch from 5 to 4 stars. Something has happened to this place over the last 2 years. It used to be a 'order your food and pay at the counter and we'll bring it over to you' experience. Now they try to herd you to a table when you walk in the door, so that you can wait for someone to bring you a glass of water that you used to just get yourself and then wait for ages for someone to take your order. And then wait for ages for the bill to be brought over so you can pay. We stopped frequenting this place simply because of this new way of serving people. We typically liked to come here during lunchtime or before heading somewhere else so can't afford to wait for very slow service. On a positive note though, the food still rocks.   ----  I have been a customer since moving to Phoenix several years ago. This place is great for vegetarians, but good for omnivores too. Meat eaters tell me the Lumberjack is awesome. I'm vegetarian, and this place is a unique find for veggie food in a very meat centric city.    You can make anything vegan, just by opting out of egg and milk products. Both are equally good.   I have enjoyed the freshness and tastiness of everything I have ever ordered here.  I usually have juice and one of their bowls with yummy pesto.  The place is usually pretty busy during prime mealtimes, so expect to wait a few minutes. It's also pricey. It isn't unusual to have a bill total $40 for two people.  That is the price you pay for fresh, healthy and organic goodness.  I have never had an issue with customer service, nor have they screwed up my order. The fresh juices and smoothies run around $8 or so and if I remember right the meals are $10-$12, give or take a couple bucks.  I have only had a few of their baked goods, but they always look tempting. Gluten-free options are available too."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I am not vegan but cannot do eggs, dairy or gluten... I had so many options at this place even with my allergies. I settled on the scramble (tofu) of the day which was with maple tempeh and dairy free cheese (daiya), sweet potato hash, and gluten free-vegan toast. I had never had a tofu scramble or tempeh so I was nervous I was going to be left disappointed and hungry! It was quite the opposite. The portion was perfect and the food was delicious!   My husband, who doesn't have any food allergies, ordered the enchilada scramble (regular eggs) which also came with the sweet potato hash and regular toast. He loved his meal! He mentioned that the enchilada sauce was so flavorful!  We both ordered lattes, his with regular milk and mine with soy milk. They were both pretty good but def not great.   We sat outside (on a not so hot summer morning) with the misters. There were plenty of plants which made for a nice environment."}
{"text":"I love love love the food here! The staff is also friendly. I take all my non-vegan friends here to show them just how good it can be to be vegan"}
{"text":"Pomegranate Cafe has delicious vegan dishes. Their desserts and so yummy. Smoothies are energizing."}
{"text":"I love Pomegranate. We have been eating here since they opened the fist restaurant.  The new restaurant is fantastic. That have the best breakfast and brunches in Phoenix. If you go there please try the chocolate cake.       ."}
{"text":"Great place and it keeps getting better. Their coffee is totally awesome (comes from coffee cartel, how could it not be?) and the menu/food choices keep getting better and better. We love to go for breakfast and get tofu scrambles.  Their vegan desserts are really incredible too. We love this place!  So great to find a vegetarian restaurant of this quality."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and tons of different options . they have fresh squeezed juice which is really awesome . Their wraps, rice bowls, burgers and weekly specials ... everything deserves a big thumbs up !!  have been to this place 3 times and they had amazing food and service each time .  Its a little pricey for a vegetarian/vegan restaurant ."}
{"text":"Support the local non chain businesses. Great tea, coffee, breakfast & lunch options. Reasonable prices, expect a bit of a wait. Although this family run business just opened this year, it already has a great following. In the Trader Joe's plaza. Awesome salads!"}
{"text":"I recently became vegetarian (on my way to becoming vegan) and my best friend (who is vegan) suggested this place tonight for dinner... and I have to say my mind was blown!!! Everything was so delicious! I got the Bountiful Bowl... a sort of Southwest style taco salad. It is huge and so unbelievably flavorful. My friend got the Mac & Cheese... the portion & flavor were outstanding as well. For desert we both got the Almond Joy type bar... it was better than the \"real thing\" and with no added/refined/artificial sugar!!! I am officially a fan. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Hidden in a strip mall but we'll worth the search right next to trader Joe's greeted immediately by likely the manager owner within a couple minutes a young server with a shirt that said positive vibes grow here she had a million dollar smile place is only 70 percent filled which is odd as most breakfast places along the way had lines outside but great energy inside every vegan natural option you can image a bit pricey had coffee burrito with egg and veggies total 15 dollars power outlets everywhere for working on pc coffee arrived warm not hot and came with coconut sugar which is a first servers are quick to clean after patrons leave a nice covered patio out front food service was quick and quality of food good overall a solid 4 the servers energy and joy made the trip worth it alone nice high energy positive experience"}
{"text":"This place is great if you're vegetarian or vegan. They have tons of options. The food is pretty good and they have a lot of good smoothie and juice choices. I had the chai latte with the pom milk and I loved it!! I'll come back and try the lunch or dinner options I wasn't crazy about breakfast though."}
{"text":"I tried this place based on a recommendation of a co-worker.  I was very excited, so we ordered a variety of items.  The food was just average at best.  The tacos were so salty I couldn't finish them...what the heck!?!?  The salads were pretty good, but nothing over the top.  I don't think I will be trying this again....expected better based on the prices I paid."}
{"text":"I've been to Pomegranate Cafe a couple times now.  Today I was really inspired to write a review.  The first time I went to Pomegranate Cafe, a neighbor and I popped in for breakfast.  The food was just okay for both of us.  It was nothing special.  I should mention that we both got egg dishes that day, though I can't quite say what we ordered back then.    Today I was low on groceries in the house, so I decided to bring the family here for breakfast.  My daughter ordered the pumpkin bread french toast, which came with fruit (some sliced apples and pears (I think) and a coconut milk ice cream sundae for dessert (topped with Vegan chocolate syrup and Vegan whipped cream).  She loved it, but the portion was quite small.  She is 4 and a light eater and she ate all her french toast in about two minutes.  I cannot imagine an 8 or 10 year old getting filled up on this portion size.  I ordered the Lumberjack (made vegan) with tofu and vegan cheese. The sandwich was just alright, but the accompaniment was pretty yummerific.  I love sweet potatoes and yams, so anything with them included is already a head above!  DH had the teriyaki \"chicken\" bowl and it not only looked fab, it was DELICIOUS.   Needless to say, \"I'll have what (he's) having.\"  Maybe I am just a fan of mock meats!    The expansion is great, but even at 10:30 on a Sunday... The place wasn't packed.    With waters all around, our bill came to $30 post tax and tip.    *Once again, I wasn't thrilled about tipping at the register.  I need to start carrying cash for these situations.   I will definitely be back to Pomegranate Cafe!  I can't wait to try their whole menu. :)"}
{"text":"We tried the Dragon bowl the grill cauliflower and the hummus platter. Honestly the hummus was the only thing that was good. And make sure you have a lot of time because we waited 45 minutes to get this food that was not very good"}
{"text":"I would say this is THE vegan restaurant in the Phoenix area with the BEST food.  I love it here.  The staff and atmosphere are great and the food is OH SO GOOD!!  Ok, so restaurant is not strictly vegan, the menu is standardly vegan and you can get egg or cheese added on at additional cost, which I have to admit I LOVE that, after years of going to other restaurants that will \"be happy to\" make your dish vegan by taking off cheese and egg and charging you the same price.   Anyhow, I went off on a tangent and I only order the vegan options anyway.    The items on the menu are fresh, super duper tasty, and great portions.  Fabulous breakfast choices!!!!! YAY!  VEGANS REJOICE!  It is so hard to find decent vegan breakfast options around Phoenix, and Pomegranate Cafe has amazing breakfast options!!!  I cannot wait until the new central Phoenix location is opened!    Thank you Pomegranate Cafe for being SO AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and staff are friendly and welcoming. Wait time isnt that bad but well worth it for the food."}
