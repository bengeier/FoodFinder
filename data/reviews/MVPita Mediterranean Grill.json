{"text":"Incredibly fresh Mediterranean eats - delicious too! We got the meat sampler with extra sides and nothing disappointed. Including the baklava.   Great setting....awesome staff! Michelle took our order, was super helpful and informative and made my sister feel comfortable ordering from the menu for the first time.  I wish I lived closer... I'd be here every week!"}
{"text":"I am not the person that posts reviews everywhere I go to eat and rate my service experiences.  With that said, I feel compelled to say that MVPita has a welcoming atmosphere, great staff, very clean and the food is packed with flavor.  I recommend MVPita to anyone to stop in when you are in the area."}
{"text":"Super happy with this location for Mediterranean food.  I had tapped out of what was already in the area, so this relatively newer restaurant was a welcome addition. It's right next to Urgent Care, across from the baseball fields of Fremont Junior High.  It's a family business, displaying all teams Chicago on the walls (So many Chicagoans are moving into Mesa!), and staff has been very friendly service-wise the two times I've visited. Staff look happy, men and women, and the environment is clean and organized.   I highly recommend the gyro with regular fries and baklava. The meat is great, not too dry and not greasy at all.  The Tzatziki sauce is perfect (served on the side).  The bread is fresh and the baklava is yummy. Looking forward to trying more menu options here in the future but, for gyros, this is where to go.  In the restaurant as well as where you wait, there's plenty of room for wheelchairs and power chairs."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! The food is amazing, so fresh and flavorful. The service is wonderful, everyone is friendly and helpful. This is my new go to place for mediterranean food :)"}
{"text":"As stated, this is a new place, off to a pretty good start. Very friendly, clean. Seems to appeal to the local police, so that can't all be bad! We had the 2-meat plates, one with salad and one with hummus. Very nicely presented, and good sized portions -- we needed a box. But....It's all about the food. This is Middle-Eastern food blandized for American tastes, no doubt. The gyro meat was okay, but the kibbeh was really lacking in flavor. Folks beside us thought the chicken shawarma also lacked \"bite\". So, owners: you've got a great menu. Put some spicy into it! Then I can upgrade my review to what it should get! For now, though, it's still the \"Mix\" as our go-to place in this part of town.  But then I saw you had Kunafa on the menu. Missed that! I'll be back to give that a try!"}
{"text":"Yum! You have to try it for yourself. Just look at dishes and see how appetizing they are. My favorite - veggie plate; hubby's fav - meat platter"}
{"text":"We had MVPita delivered to our house with the request that they text up arrival- they were accommodating with the text and the food was so dang tasty! Love this place!"}
{"text":"The Falafel plate was delicious.  The atmosphere is simple and nice.  Service was excellent.  I would highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I am addicted to their chicken shawarma plate, side of rice, salad and hummus!  They have the best hummus in town!  My hubby loved their kabob plate!"}
{"text":"Good food havent had much Mediterranean food but was all pretty good"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and the owners make you feel welcome. Great vegaterian options! Love this place."}
{"text":"Coffee excellent , food excellent , service excellent, atmosphere excellent , everything works with this place. Always great to someone doing it right."}
{"text":"First time here, looked at all the pictures and read the reviews. I am so glad we got their gyros, unbelievable amount of meat, very tasty, would suggest an extra sauce as there is a ton of meat. Will be going back very soon. Also, everyone was extremely courteous and super friendly.  HUGE THUMBS UP!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting the area from California and we were lucky enough to find this place! The vegetarian sampler and the lentil soup is fantastic! I have never been a fan of falafels, but these were the BEST EVER! Really delicious and authentic Lebanese recipes. The decor doesn't do justice to this kitchen's chef! Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! MVPita. The food is amazing and the best baklava ever!   Ray and Cristian were great!!! Wonderful customer service! We had the gyro plate which was great. Tomorrow we will be back for the famous shishkobobs!! Hope they open one in Tucson!!!"}
{"text":"We went to MVPita for lunch and had a really great experience. The food was great, restaurant was clean, and service was outstanding! The staff checked on us a couple times and even gave us a free baklava after our meal! Probably one of the best baklava we've ever had! Will return!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Had the Gyros sandwich and it was very good! Good portion and very fresh. Had many Gyros sandwiches coming from Chicago and good to know I can get the same taste at MVPita"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Today was our first visit and we will be back. We had the chicken shwarma and the Hero Burger. Having lived in the Middle East we miss good shwarma meat and this place met our expectations with the chicken shwarma. I highly recommend the Hero Burger which is a fantastic blend of Mediterranean/classic American deliciousness!!!  Everyone was super friendly, the prices are so reasonable, it is tastefully decorated and very clean!! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!  Stopped by after a hike and was so pleasantly surprised with a delicious lunch!  I don't live in the area but would make the drive for sure!  Enjoyed the chicken shawarma plate.  Try this place you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I jusy found my new Greek retaurant!  It's MVP!! I found it on Yelp and decided to try it since they had good reviews and, was so happy that I finally found a good Greek restaurant nearby.  I ordered the House Salad , Chicken kabobs, and hummus and all were absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Nice family owned business. Everything was tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Exceptional service.   Food is very well priced. The hummus is delicious. The gyro was quite large for the price. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is always fresh and the falaful is so good here - never dry!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food. Fast. Outstanding Customer Service. I tried about one of everything on the menu and it was all amazing."}
{"text":"MVPita is definitely the BEST kept secret in east Mesa!! I'm from NYC originally and I'm also Greek & Turkish so I know my Mediterranean food and MVPita is absolutely delicious! My family LOVES to go to MVPita on a regular basis. I love their gyro platter piled high with delicious gryo meat and your choice of two sides (I usually get the rice which is spiced with cinnamon and their hummus and home made pita bread which is so good! Sometimes I order the salad for a side and the dressing is delicious!), but I've had several of the other items. Their chicken shwarma is really good, spiced with complex spices, but not spicy if that makes sense. Their lamb and beef kabobs are really good too. My husband likes the gyro burger when he's really hungry. That's a burger with cheese and gyro meat on it (he had one tonight and said he thought it was the best burger in town and that's saying a lot coming from him!) The Greek fries are awesome and my husband also loves the fattoush salad. The side order of garlic sauce is to die for!! If you're a garlic lover you definitely don't want to miss that!  Prices are VERY reasonable and portions are very big. The staff is super nice, everyone from the order taker at the counter, to the cooks in the kitchen. They'll do anything to make you  happy.   It's a very casual restaurant, you walk in, order from the counter and then they bring you your food. Decor is minimal but once you taste the food it won't matter. This place is all about the home made food.  You definitely will want to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food in Mesa! Just go, you won't be disappointed! Great staff that truly believe in customer service."}
{"text":"We love this place!! My mom and I come here as often as we can. The gyros are so flavorful and delicious! Give it a shot- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"free sample of baklava was nice with yelp checkin! fast service, huge portions, neatly packed in bags and togo boxes. the salad was amazing! super fresh, gyro had tons of meat. will be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow- great prompt service, great food bought the gyro lamb -nice and meaty ,the sauce made it perfect -will be back for that."}
{"text":"Family/friendly atmosphere! No seriously I felt like family. After a great lunch my grandma, dad, and I were greeted with three pieces of baklava for free from an employee! Everything homemade besides the pita bread and baklava. I can't wait to go back, for I think I found my top Mediterranean spot! Thank you MVPitas!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both had the Hero Burger and the MVP fries and all tasted AMAZING! Burgers were juicy, fries were fresh and crisp and the baklava was the best we've had!! We will definantly be back soon!! Welcome to the neighborhood MVPita, we are sure glad you are here!!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice people. I had spicy hummus with pita wedges, and tabouleh.  Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that I've only been there once. Gotta do repeat visits before I can judge consistency. Keep up the good work, MVPeople -  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to visit MVPita restaurant to check it out !The staffs were so friendly and nice welcoming the customers with a big smile I really like that .we ordered  Gyros sandwiches with fries that it has feta cheese on it .Yum !!!! it was super delicious ,not even that The lady (owner)was so generous ! We also tried the   (Kanafah) mediterranean desserts and Turkish coffee . (Oh My God very delicious) !!! . I do recommend that place to everyone . Good food Good price ."}
{"text":"A shining example of what every restaurant should be. Clean, efficient, fantastic staff, very comfortable, great price and product. My wife and I have absolutely zero negative things to say about our visit and will be making it back as often as possible. Ray may have been one of the best employees I have ever seen in any establishment."}
{"text":"Stopped in late on a friend's recommendation. The gyro was good, though it could have used a bit more sauce, and so was the babaganoush. Enthusiastic staff, comfortable environment. I expect to be back next time I'm in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Great food! The guy up front was so attentive. ( dont know his name). The food was great. Great food. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food is homemade... And, absolutely delicious. The food is considerably better than more expensive establishments. The staff is friendly and outgoing making us feel appreciated. MVPita should be everyone's go to restaurant in an otherwise bland food area. WE'LL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Can't get a bad thing here!  Love the hummus and falafels, and the meats are well seasoned and tender. The owner is a kick too!"}
{"text":"The best gyro we have ever had! Cannot wait to go back and try other items on menu.  We had take out but would like to enjoy eating in there."}
{"text":"This place awesome, we ordered the Falafel plate, Salad and the giro, all were amazing, and the price was very reasonable with good portions. This little corner has so many good places to choose from now."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek place that also delivers! Great service, insanely good food."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town! The family who owns and operates this place are amazing! Try everything! The garlic sauce and chicken shawarma are what I crave"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Great find!! This place just opened and I was highly impressed with the friendly staff, the cleanliness and most important the FOOD!!!! I went on Monday and ordered the Falafel and Hummus...it was DELICIOUS!! Had to go back Wednesday and ordered the Shish Kabob which was sooo tender and flavorful.  Not to mention the Kinafa for dessert hit the spot.  I will be a regular and encourage all to try..."}
{"text":"The falafel was outstanding. The chicken Schwarma was mediocre but the gyros were perfect. I am a huge fan of tzaziki sauce and we had to order 4 sides to have enough. Also wish there was a vegetable platter because I love to dip my veggies in Tzaziki. Great food, nice staff. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Great chicken shawarma, falafel, and pitas! They are quick and friendly and it's now my go-to spot for Greek food!"}
{"text":"This by this place for years! Never stopped in until today for lunch. Was delicious!  I had the chicken swarma. Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan! The food is amazing. The tzatziki is one of the best I've ever had. Gyros are nice and fresh. I would whole heartedly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets (Not for long) in the East valley. A family owned and operated restaurant, the food is exceptional (I mean really exceptional) and the family team provide a warm, welcoming and friendly atmosphere. Food is cooked to order and they have the absolute freshest salad I have ever had! Their Grilled chicken kabob and Gyros are superb. If you have not tried this excellent restaurant, do yourself a favor and give them a opportunity to wow you!"}
{"text":"Very good value atmosphere and service. Like pita jungle but without the giant confusing menu, taking forever and with wierd recipes.  Just the best stuff"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous find!!! Yelped for a restaurant in the area for lunch as we were driving in Mesa.  The Mediterranean menu food was great - the chicken kabobs were moist, the gyro pocket was stuffed with extremely flavorful meat, the house salad was fresh and the hummus plate delicious. Didn't choose the special fries with feta but wish I had - sounded yummy. And to top it off they gave us a special - baklava \"on the house\". I'd highly recommend this place on numerous."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Ordered combo plate to go with falafel, Kafka and lamb. Lamb was tough and tasteless. Falafel was overcooked and bone dry and tasted like yesterday's fryer oil  Kafta (formed ground beef with onion ) was raw in the middle when I cut it open. Raw ground beef!  Thank God I cut with a fork and didn't just bite in. Never again!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of all the Greek owned restaurants back near Chicago. People are really friendly and cool, and because it reminds me of the Greek owned restaurants you know the food is delicious! I try to come out here every couple weeks to show my support. Definitely a worthy place to take my Chicago friends to when they come visit!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! Super delicious, the falafel was on point. They make it from scratch! My husband has the gyro plate and it was also delicious. The staff was nice and courteous! The prices were super reasonable. To end it all we had a piece of the baklava. And again that was also delicious! We highly recommend this cute little tucked away place that serves delicious food!"}
{"text":"Wow. Ordered the shish kebob pita, $7, with garlic sauce for carry out. Expectations were exceeded, with the amount of meat offered at this price.  The meat didn't have an overly charred taste, just a good beef flavor. Onions tomatoes lettuce and several sauces available. I had a hankerin' for garlic sauce, they did not disappoint. Yum"}
{"text":"Good food and excellent prices. In an 8 day vacation, we went there twice. I had the gyro plate and the gyro pita, both were good and plenty of food. My husband had the chicken shwarma pita and the shish kebab plate and he really liked both. We did take-out both times. Atmosphere for eat-in very informal."}
{"text":"Love the food here. I was sad when my fav pizza place left this locations but I absolutely love the food at MVPita. Always fresh always great. The MVP fries are to die for."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Everything.  Fresh, delicious and propt. You have to try the  MVP fries. And the baklava was the best I've ever had. This will be a regular place we visit."}
{"text":"What a delightful dining experience I had with my wife this evening, & on a Friday night!  This was our first time and the lady at the counter walked us through their menu item by item.   With her recommendation we ordered and shared the MVPita Veggie Platter and the MVPita Sampler Platter. They came out looking exceptional and tasted even better.   Ample portions of all, which allows you to sample and then you can add ala carte if you desire.   They advertise that their customers come first and everything we observed was exactly that, they really do care.   Their Baklava is absolutely delightful!  Please try them out, just do it any night but Friday (leave it for us)!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food, surprisingly nice dark wood decor, very friendly service. Excellent falafel sandwich with tahini and hot sauce on the side."}
{"text":"The people were great, sense its been awhile that I have had mederterainian foods.  this place was great.  I will have to visit it again when we go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing all around! They have the best customer service and the food is amazing. I can definitely taste the love in their food. They always make sure you are happy. Once I ordered for delivery and it took a little over an hour, they gave us baklava on the house and made sure they apologized for the long wait. The dessert and on top of the great food was more than enough to keep me and my husband happy."}
{"text":"Excellent gyros. Moist and flavorful. Fries were too salty. Wish they had Coke Zero with their other Coke products. Fast and friendly service. I'll be back to try some of their other main dishes, like the kabobs and shawarma."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful, tasty place to eat.  And, it's nice to see a family business so successful.  Their staff was friendly and most accommodating.   I would recommend this to anyone who likes middle eastern food and those who have not tried as yet.  Even the little ones enjoyed."}
{"text":"Very flavorful and fresh. Service was very friendly and accomadatig. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The 1st time I went they had their gyros so right. Fresh pitas, fresh veggies and the gyro meat and sauce  I thought finally a place got it right.  Was excited to go again for the perfect gyro, so let down. Not consistent.  Maybe next time great again, if I choose to go."}
{"text":"What a fabulous place!  They have the freshest, homemade tasting Lebanese food.  The hummus is great and lemony, the kibbee is delicious with their yogurt salad, the falafel is housemade and incredible,  and the lentil soup is perfect.   Even the fattoush salad was crisp, lemony and flavorful.  I just love that the whole family works together and they all exhibit such gracious hospitality.   They really make you feel like family.   I am already planning on ordering platters of grape leaves, babaghanoush, and hummus for my holiday parties.  Such a refreshing find in the East Valley!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets.  I have such a difficult time finding delicious food that's healthy, I'd all but given up.  Until I found MVPita.  I eat a whole-food plant-based lifestyle (with no added oil, if possible) and these guys catered to my dietary parameters.  EVERYTHING is made to order and fresher than any restaurant I've ever eaten in.  As a vegan, my choices are somewhat limited, but at MVPita, they made me feel like the restaurant was created with people like myself in mind.  My husband is an omnivore, so he ordered a chicken dish, which he said was excellent.  The babaganoush and hummus were outstanding, and they even brought us a homemade dolma (stuffed grape leaves) to sample, just because he wanted me to see how many more options I have at this establishment.  The dolma was excellent.    I'm a picky eater.  I refused to eat crap-food, especially greasy and pre-prepared garbage.  I can't tell you how many times we've been to a restaurant and after my husband orders, I simply fold my menu up and say \"I'll just have iced tea, thanks\".  MVPita will be in our weekly rotations from now on.  I'm sad that I didn't discover it earlier.    The best part.....talk about economical!!!  $22 for the two of us, included on entree for husband, and two appetizers for me (hummus and babaganoush), plus two drinks.  We just went to a sports bar three nights ago and dropped $60 (without the tip and with NO beer/cocktails !) for three of us, so $22 for two of us is a smokin' deal.    I will be coming back to MVPita at least once a week!  They're on the southwest corner of Power & Brown, next to the NextCare Urgent Care."}
{"text":"The front emtry is a bit confusing as it sits next to NextCare but once you're inside then you'll enter the great place and have great food! This place looks amazing and decorated beautifully. A place to visit every time I'm in Mesa area. A must try to appreciate."}
{"text":"This quaint family run business wouldn't have come across my radar had a friend not introduced me. Tucked away on Power, MVPita is the real MVP (most valuable place). It's authentic, fresh and homey. Once you walk in, they've got a big welcoming sign that reads \"hummus where the heart is\". And that's right. Their homemade hummus is like no other. Smooth, silky with hints of cilantro, it's the best I've had so far in Arizona. They've also got a spicy version of it that's got just the right amount of kick. I wasn't too hungry that day and ordered a few falafels, but boy was I impressed! They came out perfectly crusted, warm and soft on the inside. I often find falafels dry and salty but these were just the right consistency and taste. The spices also gave it a unique richness that I seldom find in ordinary falafels. MVPita definitely lives up to its name."}
{"text":"First time here and it was absolutely delicious, my son ordered the Shish kabob with fries and house salad, and I asked for the Chicken Shawarma.... Pita bread is a must! We were so pleased with our orders, that we ordered an extra plate to take home. Staff was friendly and very helpful with our food selections, since we didn't know exactly what we wanted..  Can't wait to come back with the rest of the family! I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Been to MVPita about 6 times. Always good food. The MVP fries with a gyro is really solid!"}
{"text":"This place has me coming back for more and more and more of their deliciouse, well prepared meats and other dishes. Never had a bad experience here. Meats are well cooked and tender, side dishes and bread are well partnered with other fresh ingredients. Can't say I've disliked anything here. I love this spot and I'll jeep coming back not only for the food but for the friendly customer service. Bomb. Com"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The service and the food were great.  We tasted quite a few different dishes and were happy with all of them.  Easily one of the best Greek places in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I've come here many times with friends and family and have finally decided to write a much deserved review. The staff is always very friendly and hospitable. The food is always made fresh and the MVP meat sampler is outstanding! They have a variety of sauces for every pallet. I've found that ordering a falafel at many places can be risky business. But MVP pita always serves a falafel that is crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and all around delicious! The restaurant is always clean and orderly. They have a great location with plenty of parking and food is sent out quickly. They can accommodate large parties and don't forget to check in and receive your check in special! Definitely a restaurant worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly courteous staff. They are always ready to please. Today, Christian explained dishes to new customers with enthusiasm, as i have seen him and another staff do before. My friend got the gyros which she loved. I love the baba ganoush and spinach pie, as well as the falafel. And the MVP Fries are fantastic, with farlic, olive oil and feta cheese! Plenty of fresh chooces for vegerarians and meat lovers alike. And they stock my favorite beer as well, Four Peaks Kilt Lifter Scottish-Style Ale!"}
{"text":"This place is good.  Chicken is marinated perfectly.  Hummus is great.  Gyros, rice is fantastic.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here a lot. I mean A LOT. These guys rock. Their food is good. Fast service and if something goes wrong they go above and beyond to make it right! Absolutely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Wasn't thrilled as I watched my order being prepared by a staff member who wasn't wearing gloves as she handled all ingredients with bare hands.  Will not be returning there even though good is good."}
{"text":"was very pleased with my order from them. i ordered delivery from here and for the amount we ordered it showed up pretty dang fast and was delicious. i would and definitely will order from here again."}
{"text":"The Hero Burger is just...amazing. Pure tasty comfort food and hooked on this."}
{"text":"Great gyros. Their other food looks and smells amazing, but their gyros are so good, I never get anything else. Super friendly cooks and waitress, and seem to love working there."}
{"text":"My favorite spot. The best food,  and the BEST service. the falafel is amazing. and did I mention the BEST service..Be sure to try the house hot sauce.. Yum."}
{"text":"I was drawn by the clever name MVPita (Aka Most Valuable Pita). I had a quick 30 minute lunch break and wanted to check out this new spot. I ordered the chicken kebob plate ~$10 which comes with your choice of hummus or salad and either regular fries or MVP fries. MVP fries is Greek style topped with feta and other herbs like parsley. There is also the option of ordering a pita pocket which is only about $7.   I was told that the kebob would take about 10 minutes because they're all made to order to ensure freshness. It came out beautifully presented, the hummus with a splash of olive oil, olives, diced tomatoes, and spices. I loved the pita bread, soft, fresh, and hot, just the way I like it! The chicken cooked to perfection was flavorful and juicy. The fries were also good, but had just a bit too much salt. Other than that, service was great with a very friendly and welcoming staff. Definitely a great friendly atmosphere to stop in for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has amazingly friendly staff, a delicious selection of Mediterranean food, and a comfortable environment. The Hero Burger is the best burger I've ever had. The chicken shawarma pita is delectable. The MVPita veggie platter is a delightful array of delicious Mediterranean vegetarian samples that happily fed two people. I can't wait to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Such yummy food and great prices. A Must try is there hot sauce!! Best kept secret around power and brown !!Really clean and everyone is very going and friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in and picked up a combo plate of gyro and sish-kabob with spicy hummus and yellow rice as the sides. Both meats were really tasty, especially the kabob which was also really tender. The spicy hummas was really good with just a slight bit of heat. The thing that blew me away though was the yellow rice. It was soo flavorful that I could have eaten that just by itself! My interaction with the staff was brief, but pleasant. Anytime in near there I will be stopping in. Oh, a few months ago I stopped in and got their house salad with gyro meat and that was really good too."}
{"text":"3rd time here and consistent friendly service with great food. We had the falafel plate and gyros plate which were delicious. The MVP fries and the tsatsiki are fantastic. Got a free dessert :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff. Please try this restaurant. The food is uniquely excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food, nice atmosphere. I checked in on Yelp and got a free baklava. My waiter gave my boyfriend one for free, too. I ordered the Euro plate with 2 pita, hummus, flaffel, and a side salad.  You could tell everything was fresh and made that day. Nothing was greasy and this is the best flaffel I've had in Arizona. It was not dry or hard as a rock like other places make it. The dressing was for the salad was excellent. You get a lot of food at a great price. Also, the baklava will be a must for me going forward. It tasted like cinnamon pop tarts. So good. I will go back."}
{"text":"Nice to have a healthy place to eat in the area. It doesn't hurt that the food is really good too! Always friendly service on top of it"}
{"text":"We love this place! My children wanted them for the food at both their Birthday parties. I love the gyros and the mpv fries. I have tried most of the menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food served quickly. I've been there twice in the last week. Their falafel is amazing. I requested a vegetarian wrap (not on the menu) on my second visit and they whipped one up and it was delicious! They have a large dining room so it's great for families, too."}
{"text":"Not very good. The chicken was extreme dry and chewy. The person at the counter was ridiculously slow while a huge line started to form. The restaurant is cold and echos so seems extra noisy. Won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Excellent tabouleh, annoys me when places serve tabouleh and it's mostly bulgur, this was all about the parsley and herbs and the dressing was perfectly lemony and not overly oily. The gyros meat was tender, flavorful  and cut off the spit. The chicken shawarma is chicken breast and a great blend of  spices.  Tasted great but not cut off the spit like in very traditional places(baiz mkt). Baba ganoush  was smoky and delicious.  Excellent hummus.  Highly recommend if you're looking for a Chicago style pita joint that offers fries, dogs and burgers too."}
{"text":"I felt that the service was fantastic, the food was good, but I felt that the lamb plate husband and I each ordered was lacking, while the lamb was very good and tender, I received 4 very small pieces, and husband received 5 very small pieces, the hummus was good, but there was nothing to scoop it up with, we used our salad fixings in with the lamb, which was what we used our small 1/4 piece of pita with. Than we were at a loss as to how to eat the hummus"}
{"text":"Good Mediterranean food, delivered fast. Gyro platter with hummus and rice was tasty. Dolmas were ok. Tabbouleh salad was excellent. Will order again. Quality and quantity are good."}
{"text":"This is my family's and my new favorite restaurant! Everything I've tried is delicious. We come about once a week, sometimes more. The restaurant is super clean and the staff is so friendly. The staff is also very helpful. They will help you decide what to order if you arent very familiar with Greek food. I would definitely recommend MVPita to everyone!"}
{"text":"Their food is great! It does take some time though, so always keep that on mind when you order."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time. I am a fan of Greek food, and will DEFINITELY be back soon! The gyro meat is amazing! We got the hummus, gyro sandwich, and the gyro plate with rice and the Greek salad. HIGHLY recommend. One of the best Greek ma and pa places I've been to. PLEASE GO!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just pick up an order to go from this place. I decided to get the chicken kabob pita and my wife tried the chicken kabob plate.  Most incredible food ever! Including the baklava!!"}
{"text":"Lamb is amazing! Hands down the best I have ever had. Staff was friendly and nice. Mesa's best kept secret."}
{"text":"Delicious! I heard that they take long for to-go orders, so i preordered for pickup up. The cashier was nice and the prices are crazy reasonable! The gyro combo was cheap but amazing- & ridiculously generous with the MEAT! I recommend the spicy hummus- SO GOOD! And the steak kabob was a hit with my sister. Get extra tzatziki because it is FANTASTIC. Yaaas, MVPITA, YAAS!"}
{"text":"The overall setting of the restaurant is extremely warm and homey. It is a place I'd love to take the family to and have a nice dinner or lunch.  The food is extremely fresh, made right when you order it.  The steak at MVPita is also real steak, not what you would find at a Chipotle or any place of the same manner that says they serve steak.  All the meat is great quality, cooked perfectly and delicious.   What was also amazing was the Falafel.  They are not dry at all, an abundance of flavors, and great portions.  The Baba Ghanoush was one of my favorites as well, it was smokey! It had a nice kick to it and the smokiness was something I never tasted before in any over baba ghanoush. The lentil soup was also great, a nice sour soup that personally I really loved.  The overall atmosphere is welcoming. The staff comes up to you and chats with you about whatever.  They are a great help to the menu as well if you have any questions, and are there if you need anything.  It is a family staff which makes it more homier, it is a great vibe.  If you are a coffee lover, I suggest trying the Arabic Coffee they have if you have never had it.  It is definitely something different but worth a try! Ask them about it. :) 5 Stars for sure!"}
{"text":"WOW! So yummy!!!  My husband and I are vegan and we came here to try the veggie platter and I was blown away!  Great customer service and the quality of the food was exceptional and fresh! So happy to have found this place, we will definitely be back!  I ordered the fries without feta and dipped them in their hot sauce and tahini sauce. It was so delicious!  We also ordered some baklava to go. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had to send our food back 2 times..  The waitress said they were trying a different meat company and should be better next time we came in.  They did not charge us for our meals and the staff was good but the food was not that great."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Shawarma plate with salad and hummus for the sides. I'm used to getting shawarma that is roasted and sliced, like gyro meat. This was like a stew and I didn't care much for the flavor. Plus, they give you so much of it. I would've preferred less meat, more salad. The salad was really the only thing I enjoyed-peppers, tomatoes, onions with romaine and I liked the dressing. However there was so little of it. The hummus lacked flavor. I have never had hummus with so little taste to it. I love Mediterranean food and was eager to try this place so close to work. I'm sad it wasn't as good as I imagined. I'll try it again for the gyro and if it's good I'll update my review."}
{"text":"The first 3 times I went, it was delicious. But then the last time it was very bland, and the falafels were incredibly spicy out of nowhere, when previously they were not spicy at all.  I don't think I'll come back again, unless I'm desperately wanting a falafel pita and I'm nearby."}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday with the Mesa Chamber of Commerce. We enjoyed hummus, pita bread, salad, and chicken kabob. The service was excellent and the food quite good. The home feel of the staff was pleasant and attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"MV Pita is wonderful.  You order and then sit down.  Then they bring the food to you.  The gyro meat was spiced just right and is very moist.  The lamb is seasoned well and cooked medium rare.  It's excellent quality meat.  The Greek Fries are phenomenal!  They add feta, olive oil and rosemary to French fries.  Their selection of sauces  boasts tziki, spicy hummus, hummus, and garlic hummus.  All rock!  For dessert, try the baklava.  It is sweet and delicious.     MV Pita is located in a shopping center with plenty of parking.  The wait staff are happy and willing to offer suggestions as to what to try.    This is a highly recommended Greek restaurant!"}
{"text":"On our recent trip to Mesa my wife and I were looking for a place to dine. She was hungry I was not. She found M. V. Pita Mediterranean Grill on YELP and suggested we give it a try. We were not disappointed. Christian greeted us as we entered asking if this was our first time there, which of course it was. However, we are not strangers to Mediterranean, nor Greek Cusine. Christian asked what we liked and after listening suggested one of the Combos of 3 with sides, which includes:  falafel, Dolma, Gyros, Chicken kabob, Chicken Shawarma. Havingd had chicken for lunch, Christian suggested substituting steak and Hummu. All of which were delicious, the steak being tender, the gyros and hummus being flavorful as well as plentiful. Our sides were; a salad for me, and Greek and Arabic pitas with;  tatziki, garlic saucep, hot sauce and house dressing for my salad, again all were delicious. Our experience here was TOP NOTCH from entrance to exit! We will be back, AND SOON for a further adventure."}
{"text":"Awesome! Got a whole bunch of takeout and it was all delicious.  A couple of combo plates and a few appetizers was enough for several meals.  The service at the counter was excellent, friendly staff and great food!"}
{"text":"Incredible good at a great price point. Friendly staff and menu selection is one of the best Mediterranean places you'll find in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Um YES!! I have been there twice, so far! It's a flavorful fill-up and LOVED the tzatziki spread! Great place for lunch with a friend or family dinner. Plus, busy moms and dads they deliver. I will be back...yum!"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow yelpers for getting us to this place!  When you first walk in youbare greeted with a smile!   We were a rather large party of 9 all placed our orders and were happy my dad treated us.   We sat in a large booth in the back.. They had nice selection of beverages to choose from.    Once we all got settled in the booth it wasnt soon after that the staff brought over our food. There was 3 of us that checked in on yelp that used our yelp offer for the free baklava 6 of us checked in on yelp.   They only brought two baklavas over and they forgot one.  So instead the guy went to go get the other one.     When the lady who took our order brought them over to us she brought not 1 but 6 more that way everyone could have one!   I thought that was such a sweet thing to do for our table..    Now aside from giving us free baklavas. The food i had was outstanding.  I ordered the house salad with grilled chicken kebab!  I noticed when i was placing my order there was a sign that said kebabs are made to order allow 10 mins for food to be ready.   Made me choose that option especially"}
{"text":"Great food! Great staff! Always friendly! The food is always fresh! Made to order! I'm in love with their falafel, chicken shawarma and even their house salad is delicious!    I'm an employee at a business close by and one of us literally orders MVPita once a day! Atleast!"}
{"text":"The food and the friendliness of the entire staff are both outstanding.  We are always totally satisfied every visit."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in for lunch today! I had the chicken shawarma plate with hummus and a side salad. My husband had a salad with gyro meat on top. The food was delicious!!  Customer service was excellent! We will definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"Good food. Soooooo slow on the service though. I have to wait 15-20 minutes past the time food was supposed to be ready every time. EVERY TIME!  Sick of it."}
{"text":"finally a solid mediteranian restaurant in East Mesa!  Was impressed with the quality and amount of meat (chicken schwarma), fries (not the best greek but better than burger joints), and the humus was superb.  If you have an itch for med eats, this is a great place."}
{"text":"My wife couldn't even take a bite of her pita. It's was so sopping wet with grease....."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  The gyro meat is great, salad is good, mvp fries are amazing. Everything is always fresh and the meat is never dry. Try their garlic sauce, very heavy garlic flavor, we love it."}
{"text":"Food is good, it must be, because I'm not one to drive out of my way.  Love the garlic sauce and my go to plate is the chicken kabob plate, with hummus and salad. Yummy!   Love the killer beard"}
{"text":"I walked in and had no idea what MV Pita was all about. First the young woman who waited on me was the \"the cats meow\". She was so helpful in choosing what my taste would love. The Foule salad was amazing imagine hot fava beans garbanzo beans in olive oil spices and lemon juice. Crazy good. Their pita bread was so good and spicy hummus perfect.   I got my order to go and was so do happy with every bite. Thank you MV Pita.."}
{"text":"Wow! My first meal after moving here....what amazing food! Had the 3 choice plate with Sish kebab, Kofta, lamb kebab, spicy hummus, and yellow rice...and a nice warm pita, some Tahini and some delicious spicy brown dipping sauce. My sister had the chicken schwarma plate.  All proteins were juicy and well-spiced. We even tried a falafel each that are made in-house from scratch....they were crisp and flavorful, with sesame seeds and parsley in addition to the garbanzo beans. As they say here; \"Don't feel awful, eat falafel!\" If it's from MVPita...you bet I will! I will be back often!"}
{"text":"MVPita is the best EVER!!  Amazing food and even better people.  I very highly recommend MVPita."}
{"text":"The spicy hummus is my favorite. The lamb is amazing and tender. Probably my go to items now.   Customer service is awesome, they go over the menu with you briefly to help out. The layout of the place is spacious. Music is groovy. The place is well kept and clean."}
{"text":"First and foremost, Their service was splendid! Everyone was super nice!   We had just wrapped up mountain biking and we're craving craving something healthy & found them on Yelp. My friend and I both ordered salads: I had the house salad and added lamb kabobs, while she had the fatoush salad and a side spanikopita. The kabob was perfectly seated-- just a hint of char and juicy! The salads were crisp & fresh and the dressing didn't overpower it in the least.   We finished it off with a local brew (Four Peaks Kilt Lifter) and *baklava. Delicious!!  *Using the check in, we got free baklava with our lunch!   We highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Great, super friendly staff and amazing food. Vegetarian platter was legit, the dolmas were perfection. Baklava and lemon cookie were delicious. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!! The chicken shawarma plate is excellent and so filling. My only disappointed is with the mvp fries (with feta etc), because  you get approx. 300% more when you dine in than when you take them to go."}
{"text":"I've been to MVPita at Power Rd and University (SWC)5 or 6 times now, and it's one of my favorites in AZ. Their salads are always super fresh, their Pita bread is always consistently fresh and tasty. My favorite entree is the Shish Kabob with salad and that tasty rice! My son's fave is the Gyro plate and the MVP fries. We have never been disappointed, with the friendly service or the food. I absolutely recommend this place for a great family meal.    Once again July 6 2017 we had the Shis-kabob and gyro combo plates. The staff are great and my family loves their food! This is one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Just came back from MVPita. Great food, great service, great ambience. We will be back"}
{"text":"I loved it!!  My first time having Mediterranean food and it was really good.  Honestly I could eat there every day."}
{"text":"Service & Food was great!!! Very flavorful with some great seasoning.  Rice could have been hotter.  Hope they keep doing what they are doing!!! Will definitely be a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma plate with spicy hummus is delicious.  I love coming here whenever I'm in Mesa."}
{"text":"Defiantly one of my new favorite places to go! Delicious lamb and beef gyro and the chicken shawarma was also very delicious. Service was very nice, and knew the menu."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! The rice is excellent along with the chicken. If you are new to Mediterranean food this is very mildly seasoned ( a bonus for some). The falafel came out a bit over done but this was our first time in and we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Their food is absolutely amazing! Fantastic customer service and just great experience overall. We have come here 3 different times including lunch on Mother's Day and they had a single rose that they gave to all of the Mother's who came in (including me) it was so sweet.   Will continue to eat yummy food there!!"}
{"text":"Great Pitas and a family feel! Large serving sizes and very helpful for novis Mediterranean eaters."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service! Rice was perfect and the chicken was great as well. I would definitely recommend it especially to anyone new to Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Best food around terrific service and people. Worth the visit.  Have been here 10timea and will keep coming."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this gem one night.  Been back 3 times since.  They are extremely friendly, are reasonably priced, and the food is EXCELLENT.  They moved a few years back from Chicago, and one thing this Chicago transplant misses about Chitown is the food.  Little mom/pop places like this are popping up in the valley... and this is one of best places I have found.  My better half loves falafel and their gyros!  Give them a shot.. you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very delicious mediterranean! Great mixed plate which allowed us to taste some great hummus and kefta! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I grew up with homemade Lebanese food, and I have an addiction to lemon juice. This place did not disappoint. I got takeout, and I feel like it would be even better if I dined in. I ordered the chicken kabob plate with garlic, rice, mvp fries, and a side of falafel. It was all delicious. The chicken was a little dry, but that's how I cook it too, so it didn't bother me at all. The atmosphere inside is nice, and the staff seemed friendly. I was just picking up an online order, so not a whole lot of interaction, but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Quick Serve Greek food Mediterranean market is fairly saturated right now as there are quite a few competitive choices to choose from throughout The Valley.  I've been to MVP grill several times now, and I'm still mystified by all of the high reviews and glowing raves (I started this review back in 2015 and did not finish it because I thought I might be missing something - but I haven't, and it still is an \"a-ok\" place).  It's not that the food or service is bad per se, it's just the food isn't yummy enough to keep them at the top of my mind when wanting Mediterranean food. It's obvious that they use the same purveyor for foodstuffs as many others pita/gyro places in the valley . . . and that's not a bad thing, however, it really doesn't do much to set you apart from the crowd.   What MVPita does have are generous portions and friendly customer service.  I've been there when it was completely empty at noon on a weekday and when it was fairly busy during weekend lunch or dinnertime and each time the staff is friendly and congenial - jovial even.    However, the service is not overly attentive nor is the food prepared or served in a quick manner.  Granted, it is a Quickserve restaurant in which you walk to the counter, place your order and then the food is delivered to your table, so I really don't expect a lot, but it does take a bit longer to get your food than it should.  Another oddity: there seems to be a disconnect from the friendly staff and the delivery of your meal to the table.  It's a hands off affair in which there seems to be an indifferent attitude towards the taste and quality of the food served or the need for anything that might complement the meal further.  Read; there is no follow from the friendly staff about the taste, freshness, or preparation of your food; if you need something or have a request or issue, go back to the counter and ask - friendliness then becomes procedural.   The Decor inside is nothing special, and somehow seems a bit cold despite having warm and inviting colors and textures such as dark woods and earth tones.  I find that the lighting is a bit harsh and abrupt (perhaps lower wattage bulbs, less reflective surfaces or better aiming?) and then there's that odd room at the front of the dining room with nothing in it that seems like the naughty corner . . . I always want to ask what it is used for, but I don't because I feel like I am the only one who doesn't get the joke or understand its function.  But I digress, as this is a casual quick service establishment not meant to be intimate or spend more than a minimal amount of time inside.   Drink fountain choices are limited in quantity, and are of the Coca Cola variety.  I'm also sad to see that there is no fresh brewed iced tea despite the ample counter space for it.  Although the main food offerings are sufficient in flavor and size, I find that the side dishes are prepared with less love and affection than the main dishes.  This is evident in the falafel which can often be a bit dry and overdone, the Dolmas which share a dryness in the rice contained within, and the French fries which could, and should, be freshly prepared to order and not just kept warm - sadly, this was consistent on multiple visits.   My overall advice, if you're in the area and have a hankering for Mediterranean, MVPita will do, but don't have high expectations as I find the food, preparation and atmosphere just average . . . with the exception of friendly, talkative staff that helps to slightly elevate an a-ok experience and is perhaps the reason for the slightly elevated ratings found here on Yelp.   Overall rating: 3 Quality: 3 Service: 2.8 Cleanliness: 3.2 Value: 3 Atmosphere: 2.6"}
{"text":"I just landed from Chicago. Discovered this lace through yelp and wow. This place has good food. Had the combination lamb and chicken kabob. Must try."}
{"text":"Love this local spot. Chicago fans offer some delicious Greek staples at a good price, good size portions and cool people. Good kids menu too. Mon-Tues $3.99 Gyro special"}
{"text":"We had the gyro, kabob, and schwarma and it was all delicious! Great quality food and a good atmosphere. They're very friendly here and happy to answer any questions about the menu. They even brought out some complementary baklava and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Family owned with great customer service. I will def be back! Try the chicken shawarma plate with the garlic sauce.... delicious!!!"}
{"text":"First time ordering here. It was absolutely amazing! My husband and I both got the pita pocket! My new favorite restaurant!!! Highly suggest!"}
{"text":"Gyro! Gyro! Gyro!... I always say that in my head like it's coming from a food barker on the street inviting me over to his rotating spit of meat.  I love a good deal, the Monday and Tuesday Gyro deal cannot be beat.  Add some MVP fries or a Greek salad and you are set. Great for lunch or dinner.  They also do a pretty good kids hamburger."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I've tried just about everything on the menu and it's been fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly tasty food and for the price ?! I mean come on, what is there to think about ??  Also, added Bonus- great customer service. Will be returning. Thanks guys !"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE,LOVE this place. My sister and I ordered the gyro, a Greek salad and Mediterranean fries. All the food was delicious and everything was definitely fresh. Besides the great food the staff were the BEST!!! They definitely deserve to stay around so please support them! P.s. The place was spotless"}
{"text":"Good quantity for the price. Service was very good and very friendly (4 stars). The atmosphere is good, clean, fresh, although a strange layout, you walk into a counter and tables are around the side. All mentioned above are above average. The part that is just \"average\" (3 stars) is the food. While it was plentiful and we didn't leave hungry, the taste of the food was unremarkable. It wasn't bad, but wasn't great. If you want a \"good\" meal, good amount of food and nice service, this is a good place.  We may have been spoiled and our perceptions tainted by other Mediterranean restaurants, one in Tempe and one near the Broadway Curve that are outstanding."}
{"text":"The salad was tasty but lacked the veggies I anticipated. It was mostly lettuce. The chicken was good but nothing unique, probably should've ordered the shawarma instead. They gave us a baklava sample which was super yummy"}
{"text":"Love the service at MVPita. These all-stars know how to treat their customers...they serve delicious food that will keep this satisfied diner coming back.  Michelle, Christian, Lindsey and the rest of the MVP's are awesome! Did I mention how much I love the baklava?!!?!"}
{"text":"Very good food, fresh, clean, and reasonable prices. I've had the chicken shawarma plate and the kabob plate. Try their garlic sauce it's really good."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here almost every week for the house salad (add chicken kabob), it's seriously that good. The food is always fresh and tasty and the service is great. It's not the least expensive option but you get what you pay for and this place is legit."}
{"text":"It was....ok. Polite service, but it took a LONG time for the food to come out. They were nice enough to bring out complimentary soup while we were waiting.  I had the chicken wrap, which was tasty, but unremarkable.   The setup is a bit odd. I'd recommend having actual wait service instead of ordering at the counter."}
{"text":"I ordered the simple falafel and a drink. It came out quick, and good. A great place for healthy eating. Very spatious dining room, if that matters at all..."}
{"text":"Staff was super nice. They explained the dishes to me and recommended the MVP Sampler, which I did order. It came with chicken, falafel and gyro and humans and pitas. The meat was delicious and he chicken had the right amount of seasoning. Great taste and freshly cooked. The falafel was my favorite, it wasn't dry and had the right amount of seasoning. I think two people could easily share this sampler. Don't forget to check in and get your free baklava."}
{"text":"All around excellent!  First time from friends' suggestion (Brent & Kati).  They placed an order and I came by to pick it up.  I'm not much of a salad eater but I did order one of their popular salads, Kati ordered salad with falafel & a side of rice and Brent ordered a dish with some kind of steak.  I tried a little bit of everything as they shared and everything was delicious!  The food was prepared quickly so a very short wait and the employees were very helpful and friendly.  I can see why they have very good reviews!  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I now understand all the four and five star ratings now that our party of four had dinner there yesterday.   Pros: huge portions, delicious meats, excellent prices, and the wait staff were cheery and helpful. I took some of my dinner home for lunch the next day.   Cons: the blaring music was tailored for the younger crowd, extremely loud rock and roll. That made conversation very difficult. The premises, though very clean, were kind of shabby and worn for a restaurant that has been in operation for less than one year. I suspect they took over an existing place to save money.  All in all a restaurant worth going back to just for the food."}
{"text":"This place is seriously awesome. The staff was extremely nice and explained what the different types of Greek food were without getting annoyed with me for not knowing. The explosions of flavor from the different dishes I tried had me kicking myself for not knowing about this place sooner.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food,great service,and affordable . Their Falafel is made by hand an it's bomb  with the sauce. I love that Midwest vibe and culture. I live far from this place,but definitely worth the drive.  My guy loves their gyro burgers. No wonder they won a  trophy for it.Great job guys!!!"}
{"text":"So stinking good!  Falafel, shwarna, gyros.  Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  Run don't walk to SW corner Brown and Power Rds.  Just incredible."}
{"text":"Try the spicy humus! And the pita pockets are huge!! Staff is super friendly and food comes out quick :) booths are comfortable and very clean"}
{"text":"Without a doubt mvpita is my favorite Mediterranean restaurant of all time! It is a wonderful family run business! I am particularly fond of the chicken shawarma pita! Everything is homemade from recipes of the family has made for themselves!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken shwarma plate. Delivered by Uber. It was very good. I got an extra pita which is recommended as it only comes with one. The garlic sauce is really good and worth adding on. The salad and hummus were good. Chicken was good. I felt very full but healthy and not gross after eating.   Would have been 5 star, but the baklava was rancid. Totally disgusting.   Still, things happen. The entree was very fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This place rocks great food and they deliver I have dined in once but have had delivery 3 or so times ......."}
{"text":"Our first time here.  Very friendly service  The hummus was great and the tziki (?) was excellent.  I had the lamb plate. The lamb was a bit overlooked but tasty. The salad was fresh and the dressing was excellent.  The only complaint I would have is the music playing too loud.  I will definitely go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"our friends told us about this place it was a must see/visit great food  the service was great::::: food was incredible :::::::::: price was reasonable  we can from california wish we had a place like mvpita here in cali  thank you mvpita for making our arizona visit great"}
{"text":"Not sure how, but this place gets better each time I come here! Service is great and every time I get take out food is ready and still warm when I get back to the office.   The chicken kabob plate is absolutely fire! My boss loves the falafel. Highly recommend especially if it's you and a couple of the guys."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant as a healthy option to pizza on nights when it's crazy and we don't have time to cook. I'm impressed by the amount of food you get for the price. We have a family of 6 (4 kids) and 2 orders of the 3 entree plates are enough to feed us all! We like to get a side of the dolmas too- our kids favorite. So happy to have found this place and hope they stay around for a long time! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. From the moment u walk into the restaurant, till you leave, you are having a great experience. Food is delicious and portions are pretty big. The salad is very fresh and the veggies are so crisp. The feta cheese is one of the best I had and the dressing is just wonderful. The meat was cooked to perfection. The hummus was very good. Generous portions, clean restaurant, excellent food and service, what else could you ask for! Definitely coming back and recommending it to friends and family! Thank you for opening nearby"}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier to find this place.  Great food and the most friendly people.  Christian and his mother Tanya made me feel right at home from the moment I walked in.  This could be my new favorite local spot!"}
{"text":"Here for the anniversary. Great service friendly atmosphere. We will be back! The line moves fast."}
{"text":"This is the first true Kafta I have had in Arizona! Working in a Lebanese restaurant for the past three years, I am a true connoisseur! With great prices and friendly staff what's not to love? Btw the Tabouleh is as fresh as it gets, I feel like I'm eating back in time at the Mesopotamian river with the freshness of the ingredients. A must if ever in the area, this is a bargain that's tough to beat!"}
{"text":"We found this place by searching on Yelp, and the ratings were spot-on!  We had a delicious family meal.  My kids enjoyed the food, and they are picky!  They have some great kid food options if your kids are not adventurous.  I am on a very limited diet, but the chicken platter fit perfectly for me.  It felt like a real treat to me but I was still on plan.  We also had a free piece of baklava for checking in on Yelp, which my 4 year old devoured. A wonderful experience- and we got to sit outside on a glorious afternoon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! Weve been here twice and have never been disappointed. The food is amazing. Classic gyro all the way! Plus the staff is so friendly and knowledgable. Lindsey, the owner i believe, is a sweetheart and will answer any questions you have! Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I went in MVPita for the first time today. The Server was very friendly and nicely explained us the menu and suggested to have the combo platter . We chose chicken schwarma , chicken kabob and falafel. All the 3 items were very good but the definetly recommend the schwarma . We had a free baklava on check in which was pretty good too. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome that I didn't even mind when they forgot the pita bread. The delivery person said to tell them next time that they owe me pita bread.  I still gave them a tip."}
{"text":"Delicious! Got the chicken mvpita and was quite satisfied. Only criticism is their tziki sauce is the consistency of cream cheese, I would prefer a thinner sauce."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  The shish kabob steak is amazing!!  I would rather have it than any steakhouse!  The staff is super nice and helpful.  The MVP fries are the best fries ever!! The salad is amazing as well!! Go there and you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We had the great pleasure of dining at this restaurant today. The food was absolutely amazing.   I had the chicken shawarma! Delicious! The plate was large and had lots to take home. I loved that they give you suggestions of the best value.  The seasoning was superb.  The restaurant was clean. (restrooms too)  Staff was very friendly seems like they enjoyed being at work.  The owner came around to all the tables to check on everyone and If I dare say, his beard was perfectly manicured.  We will be back for sure. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So many fabulous flavors! We ordered the veggie sampler plate and it was deeee-lishious. They brought us additional sauces: Tahini, garlic, Tazikki, & a chili-like lentil. Had a large Tabouli plate too. Restaurant & bathrooms were clean. Temp was not too cold and Music was on low volume. Very pleasant for conversation with our friends. Will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"This place is always amazing! Our go to for a quick dinner. If you do the 3 meat combo, it's enough food to share, assuming the person you share with doesn't eat too much haha."}
{"text":"Terrific place with solid, friendly help. Had the gyro and it was stellar. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I live nearby this little gem, and have to say I can't believe I didn't try it sooner! Was very good, can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is healthy , close and Fabulous. Staff is always friendly and the chick pea salad is the best although it is more like soup than a salad. Spanikopita is yum yum"}
{"text":"We walked in based on a referral and it was okay.  The staff seemed hurried and not very interested in providing recommendations.  The music was so loud we could hardly hear one another at our table.  The chicken was cold and the steak over cooked.  I think they have potential to be better."}
{"text":"Back again at MVPita.  This place is amazing.  The shish is so tender and cooked just right.  The chicken shawarma is spiced to perfection.  I got the MVP fries today for the first time and they were the best.  The people here are so friendly both on the phone and at the counter.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I just found our new favorite place! So yummy!!!! I will be recommending this restaurant to everyone!  I couldn't believe how awesome the people are!"}
{"text":"The best dolma I've ever had.  Nice family owned and operated business with excellent service and awesome food.  If you are in the area, do yourself a favor and stop by."}
{"text":"Stopped Friday night for dinner for the 1st time given all the reviews.  Place was rather empty.  Ordered the sampler platter and the gyro platter and it was $22 with water for drinks.  Several people showed up after that and were ordering for 15 minutes.  Unfortunately the kitchen crew had served up our food in the interim but the hostess was busy taking orders and what we received was rather cold.  Next table that had ordered had same issue with nothing hot on the plates.  Food itself was OK but nothing special and our order was screwed up as well (with apparently the next table adjacent).  Just a note for folks: Apparently some fermented (vinegar?) is used in the tangy salad dressing.  Ended up with an allergic reaction to it for almost 24hrs and not a fun experience.  For those with food allergies -- please be cautious!  (I've never had an issue before like this at a restaurant)  The leftovers (meat / fries) taken home were reheated the next day in the oven and it was better than what was served the night before."}
{"text":"OMG its just not fair!!!!!!!!! We only get on that side of town once in a great while, and now find that there are two great Gyro places within a mile of each other.  MVPita should not be missed, had the Gyro and ordered an order of the MVP fries on the side,  outstanding!!!! Best tzatziki sauce in the east valley, be sure to order extra for the fries. Nice large dining room with plenty of seating, fast service, can't say enough nice things about this place. Be sure to tag this place when you get there and get a free slice of baklava  We will be back."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and have never been disappointed. All the menu items we've tried are superb!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the staff is great. Brings back good food. I love the place and free desert"}
{"text":"The food from this restaurant was very good. We did a carry out order. It was packed well and you could tell they cared about the food getting back to your home in perfect condition. We both had gyros that were very tasty and a very fresh salad. Baklava was yummy. Will go back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner tonight and had a great experience. This is a new restaurant so it wasn't very busy but the food is some of the best Greek food you will find in Mesa. I had the falafel platter which came with rice, hummus, and pita bread and the falafel was nice and crispy with a lot of flavor. I would definitely get that again. My fiancé got the two meat plate with chicken and gyro meat and she really enjoyed the chicken as well as the Greek salad. She thought the dressing for the salad was fantastic. Prices were also very reasonable considering that I've been to other Greek places and have spent more money and they have given me smaller portions. You definitely get some good portions here. To top it off, the owner came to our table and provided us with some complimentary baklava which was very tasty. He also let us sample another one of their desserts with their homemade filo dough and sweet ricotta cheese. It was a very unique, yet delicious dessert. The owner was super friendly and you can tell this is an awesome family-owned restaurant. Will definitely be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"We get food here all the time. Everyone is good. Euro meat and schwarma are awesome. Love the mvpita fries"}
{"text":"Our first time trying gyros in Arizona and it was great. We're from Chicago, so our expectations about food every where else are set higher than norm. This place was great."}
{"text":"30$ was way overpriced for what I received , the Gyro was great and the hummus was flavorful but ... From what I can gather , my order was taken out back and beaten then dumped in a lake ... Not sure how the inside of a small styrofoam conrianer can look like a genocide but after cross refrencing murder scene photographs with my order it was identical ... I hope I'm not incriminated in anything"}
{"text":"Great food! Large variety vegetarian and meat options. Keep coming back! Love the chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"MVPita is such a wonderful restaurant. As a person with a gluten allergy, I know that the food I get here is safe. All the staff members are very knowledgeable and take my allergy seriously. Everything except the pitas are gluten free! I always order the chicken kabob plate and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food - not big on Mediterranean but they really helped order what they thought we'd like best - chicken shawarma was great.  Had baclava which was really good...We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a local restaurant that offers both takeout and dine-in options.  The menu was pretty simple and the food was outstanding.  When we arrived it was busy so we knew we had found something good.  The kids meals were great... $3-$5 dollars and good sizes.  I had a gyro and my wife had the shwarma.  They also have beer and some other sides that all looked good.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Best Pitas and Greek Fries! Love this place! They deliver too and very reasonable in price!"}
{"text":"Im reviewing their vegetarian options since there is a nice selection of veggie and vegan dishes that are all delicious! My husband has said the gyro is great and my brother loves their gyro burger. I think they make the best falafel Ive ever tasted. So good."}
{"text":"5 stars for everything. All the food is great! I usually get Steak kabob or chicken kabob, with garlic sauce and rice. The mvp fries are very good too. Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Best place to get shawarma on this side of the valley. Their pitas and plates are amazing. Hummus is very good as well"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been back so many times I've lost count The owner is so sweet and his mom makes the best food. I had the pick 3 and everything was delicious and the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Always great. I've only done take out but the wait does not seem long and it is always fresh. Lots on the menu, everything you would expect from a Mediterranean menu.  Love the vegetarian options. It is my go to place. Never disappointed and very reasonable prices. Sizes of the platters means leftovers for me!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and attention to food allergies. The detail of their spices compliments the quality of their food. An excellent date night or lunch break to go. The cater, deliver, and order for pick up."}
{"text":"MVPita is my new favorite restaurant! I have eaten there twice and just took my husband there for his first time today. The restaurant is very clean, great atmosphere, and everyone is VERY friendly. My husband and I ate in the restaurant (first time I had take-a-way) and met the entire family who all work there....family owned/operated and very authentic. They told us how they make items on the menu and brought out samples of their vegan dessert, baklava, and their famous falafel! Everything was so wonderful, hot and fresh!!! We had the kefta and chicken shawarma with rice, salad and pita bread....ALL FABULOUS!  The garlic sauce, tahini, and hot sauces are amazing! We will definitely be back next week:)"}
{"text":"If you look at my review history on Yelp, the overwhelming majority of my reviews have earned 4 or 5 stars. I hate to give bad reviews because I want our local restaurants to succeed. I want them to be a regular stop for my family. MVPita (my third visit here) did one thing after another to lose my patronage.  *The wait for my to go order was quite long. To make matters worse, a group of three guys who came to eat in-house (and arrived a fair amount of time after me) got their meals served long before my order came up. It's possible they called in their orders but I highly doubt that. *I had to double check my order, and found a side of hummus and pita was missing. Once I let them know, the cashier was distracted by a phone order, and left me waiting even longer to get my missing side. *I could have overlooked those first two things, except I arrived home and got a first look at my shish kebob. They had burned the pita, and the meat was burned and way over cooked. That is just a complete lack of caring. The restaurant was not crowded, so it's not like the kitchen was overwhelmed with orders. If the cook's lack of attention means they burn the food, they shouldn't be wrapping it up to serve. *The parts of the pita and shish kabob that weren't scorched actually tasted fine. You could tell that the meat had been marinated and had good flavor. The burned parts tasted terrible or were inedible.   I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Amazing food .. great quality .. The person at the reception takes a good amount of time to explain about the food and menu and very patient .. service was fast .. a great experience"}
{"text":"SO yummy! We ordered the two entree plate as a take-out, to share. We chose the chicken kabob and lamb kabob. The meat was tender and succulent and Oh, So Tasty! The rice was Perfect! And the side salad was also fantastic! We walked in and ordered - the meal was prepared quickly and we were on our way after just a brief wait. This was our first time at MVPita and it Definitely won't be the last!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We eat here numerous times a month and it's always consistent! Great food and service! Keep it up! Try the Kabobs!"}
{"text":"Great food! We had the sampler, house salad, and mvp fries. Everything was really good and fresh. My husband said it was one of the best falafel he has every had and he is a chef."}
{"text":"This was a last-minute find but this would be on one of my favorite place to go from now on. Very nicely decorated and very clean. Staff is courteous and very pleasant.  Food was delicious and presentation was impressive."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is just like back home in Chicago. Very friendly atmosphere. Definitely returning, especially for the baklava!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We tried the chicken shwarma and gyro plate and they were good but not mind blowing good. The humus was a little dry for my tastes but it had good flavor. We will probably eat here again."}
{"text":"My Mom is Lebanese and I grew up eating this food, but I can confidently say that they are the real deal and my Mom agrees! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I got the hero burger it was a perfect mix of a burger and gyro mixed. Would defiantly get it again. Talked to the chef in the kitchen talking about putting bacon on it and calling it super hero burger. Can't wait to try that."}
{"text":"We happened to be on this side of town today and found the reviews on Yelp! The people were right! This place is great! I had the falafel plate with spicy hummus and rice. Falafels were cooked perfectly with great flavor and texture inside and out. The rice was flavorful and cooked nice as well! Tasty hummus with warmed pita:) yum yum! I'm not a big tahini fan, so I stole my hubbies tzatziki sauce. He got the hero burger and loved it!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a place. Being on a keto diet is easy here. Really tasty chicken. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here. Food great on both visits!! Seems to have a steady flow of customers coming and going with take out."}
{"text":"So good! I've ordered food here every week since discovering this restaurant, three months ago. The MVP Fries are addicting, don't order them unless you're prepared to frequent this spot; because they are everything. Delivery is fairly quick! Not Jimmy Johns quick, but also not pizza delivery slow. Basically, I've always gotten my food prior to forgetting about it, or having to raid the kitchen for a snack to tie me over. - The chicken Shawarma is the bomb, as wells as the Gyro Plate, and I've considered using their Baklava(my mouth is watering) as a replacement for my wedding cake. My go-to is usually a Chicken Kabob Pita Pocket, and of course MVP Fries. That's been my favorite so far, but I'm going for the Falafel next time and will have an update. I'm sure I'll be more than delighted. - To sum things up, I'm a fan-girl. I can't wait to see this restaurant grow!"}
{"text":"Best Gyros and best service! We have been looking for a place to get a good Gyro since we moved here 3 years ago. After this weekend, we found it! We arrived with a large party...most of whom were kids. We were greeted by Ray who quickly greeted us and provided us with information about the menu choices. After ordering and being seated, our food was served quickly, hot, fresh and full of flavor. We ordered gyros (they do not skimp on the meat),hummus and pita, salad, fries, and MVP fries. You must have the MVP fries!!!!! Honestly, everything was delicious and this will be our new place to frequent for date night or as a family. Thank you for great food and great service Ray!!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place recently and They have amazing incredible food. The staff is wonderful and very personal as well. Would recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"So I've always been one to try new places and today I just couldn't decide what I wanted, and so I remembeted I had heard of these guys on the radio somewhere. I went on a limb and tried them out. Immediately was greeted and the cashier Lyndsey was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave me a list of suggestions and pointed out the top sellers in their restaurant. She was very kind and was patient with me as I decided what I wanted. I ended uo choosing the chicken swharma plate (pardon any misspelling) and went with rice and hummus as my sides. It was very well seasoned and tasted just fantastic. They also threw in a baklava for my first visit, which was also very tasty! All in all, this place offers good service and great food, at least from my first impression. Definitely going there again."}
{"text":"Came here for the Mon & Tues Gyro special. It was some good bang for my buck! Large gyro and it was tasty. The side of rice I ordered wasn't my favorite but I was so hungry I ate it! Out dated interior but friendly staff and good food!  The little dessert you get with the check in special for that day was yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food! Biggest gyro I have ever had, and it tastes amazing. The owner is a great guy, and always friendly."}
{"text":"Crappy service model. Only one person in the front of house who both takes orders at the front and delivers food to tables. Poor service results! Don't bother ordering a second round of drinks, the unacceptable wait time means you'll be sitting around waiting long after you've finished your food."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Greek restaurants. They get two thumbs up for quality, value, friendliness and overall awesomeness! The portions you get are definitely worth how much you pay. The food itself is very delicious, I love the salad with the bell peppers and feta; too delicious! I usually get the chicken shawarma or a chicken kabob and love them both. The rice is super tasty too. Plus, their baklava is absolutely OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Their service is also something that stands out as they are genuine and kind. These are attributes I really appreciate.   So, definitely try this neighborhood Mediterranean grill. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the \"Hero\" burger and fries and shawarma chicken. Delicious! We will definitely come back again, and again!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The guy at the counter was very friendly and helpful. He explained the menu and told us the best values. The food was great. I had a combo meat plate with chicken shawarma and lamb. Both were delicious. It also came with falafel and warm pita bread with hummus. I plan going back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken Shawarma, juicy, tender and with a delicious rub that I will definitely order again when I return. Pitas were fresh, hummus and salad just perfect."}
{"text":"We had a early dinner here today (our second visit) and I had the MVPita Pocket! It's was so good!! It had lettuce, tomato and sautéed onions with Gyro meat and Kefta which is ground beef, onion and parsley made into patties and sprinkled with feta cheese. You also get a side of tzatziki sauce with it.  For dessert I shared the Kinafa with my husband, which I found out is a Lebanese dessert. Made with a light pastry crust, ricotta cheese and pistachios sprinkled on top. Nice and light. I would order it all again.  When I go back I want to try the Dolmas and Lentil soup.  Stop in and say hi to Michelle, her brother & mom! Locally owned restaurant by a super nice family!"}
{"text":"This gyro is so yummy! And the staff were super nice.  I think I found my new pita go to place."}
{"text":"This was our first time to MVPita because we were looking for somewhere new to eat. I had the chicken kabob and from the first bite, I knew I was going to really enjoy this meal. The spicy hummus was just right. Everything on my plate was amazing and delicious.  We used the Yelp coupon for some Baklava and it was so light and crispy. We will be back to enjoy another meal very soon."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's my favorite Mediterranean place in Mesa!   The first time I got the two choice plate with chicken shawarma, Kefta, rice, and spicy hummus. Everything came out quickly (pick up order) and was delicious although I found the shawarma to be a little dry. Also, the pita bread is AWESOME-warm, buttery, and not chewy at all   This time I got the chicken kabob, spicy hummus, salad, and kefta. This wasn't on the order form but thy were extremely accommodating. They even gave me veggies to go with the hummus because I didn't want pita bread. The kefta is super flavorful and probably my favorite item here. The kabob tasted just like the shawarma. They were both chicken breast which was kind of a bummer since I expected dark meat on the kabob. It was flavorful but dry. I normally don't review salads (salads are salads) but the salad here was delicious- great balance of flavors and everything was so fresh. For $10, this was an extremely filling and delicious meal, and low carb! My only complaint about this meal was that the tzaziki was not good at all. It was just off and I couldn't really eat any of it-I hope this was just a fluke.  The service is good too. I can't say much since I've only gotten pickup but everyone is extremely professional, and super nice. The cashier even gave me a free sauce. Definitely try this place out and get the kefta, pita bread, or salad!! I can't wait to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"We ate there last night for the first time. Freshest and best Fallafel we've ever had. The chicken and lamb were absolultely delicious! Rice was wonderful and they gave us free Baklava as a first time guest. Fabulous taste and value for the price. Prices were very reasonable. We will go there often. A delightful gem in Mesa. Staff was friendly and service was great."}
{"text":"Go to place for Mediterranean food.  Cheaper than others in the area and much nicer inside with a better atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"Great Food! I haven't had stuffed grape leaves in a while and it was delicious Spinach pie was awesome as well. Good friendly service with a huge smile! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! The girl working in the front is very nice. My family and I will be returning!:)"}
{"text":"I recently went here with a friend and was pleasantly surprised at the value and flavor of the food here. I ordered the Chicken schwarma plate with hummus and salad, because I'm a fat guy trying to eat healthier. Aaanywaays, the chicken on this plate was Hella awesome. Kids still say Hella right? It was suuuuuper tender and tons of flavor. The hummus and pita is pretty great too. I mean, this all could be my upped dosage of zoloft talking, but damn I really liked this place."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly, helpful and patient with me. The food was fantastic, best gyro meat I have eaten since we got to the Phoenix area...That was some tasty meat!  The portions? Good amount. Next time I want to try the gyro hamburger (don't know what it's called exactly but it looked awesome). I will try to post a picture. BTW, I got the 3 meat plate"}
{"text":"Going downhill.   Another location in Mesa that was good, but has become just another casualty of Mesa.  We arrived about 7:30 or so in the evening, so granted the dinner rush had just finished, and one would expect the dining room to be a tad bit in disarray.   However, what we found was that all of the tables, although cleaned off of dishes, were still dirty, and we had to wipe our own down.  To add this, one of the employees that obviously worked there and who had his family joining him for dinner, had to have seen us wiping off our own table, but made no effort to pull out any other employees to tend to the dining room.   Add to that, when we walked in there were almost five people in the kitchen and one girl on her cell phone so obviously things were so important on her phone, that she could not find the time to go out and wipe the tables either.  The only saving grace is that the food was decent. Was it over the top?  No.   It was a decent and the price was okay.   Will we be back again?   Probably not, and venture to say if they don't tend to business and appearances, neither will others.  Again another restaurant in Mesa that had potential and was doing really well on the front end,  is now headed into the toilet.   The place still has some potential, and I like to see small businesses thrive.   I just hope the owners open their eyes and realize what's going on before it's too late.    Dang, we have to literally  leave Mesa to get a decent food anymore. Pathetic."}
{"text":"I work next door and I am addicted!!!  I have eaten there 4 times since they opened last week!  The falafel is the best I have ever had, as is the hummus, and the schwarma and the gyro and the babaganoosh!  They are so nice in there too, and very fast service.  The place is really pretty inside too.  They are very nice about accomodating my low carb diet, and will make special changes for me on the plates.  I am so glad they moved in next door!  I am bringing my husband for dinner this weekend. :-)"}
{"text":"Visited this place today.  The chicken & rice plate was delicious. Very friendly staff. They gave us complimentary Baklava for desert. We r definitely returning."}
{"text":"WOW! Might sell our house just so we can move closer. Had the meat and veg sampler, lentil soup, and foule salad. Everything is freshly made by mama and she's here with her family running this clean and beautiful restaurant. Just as much care was put into the atmosphere as the food. You feel like one of the family. One warning, if you try the falafel, you'll never eat it anywhere else again."}
{"text":"Love this place, great flavors, awesome selection of authentic food, really awesome staff, and the owner is great, really cares about the food.  I have not had anything else in the area like this, they do it right!"}
{"text":"Yummy food can be found here. The hero burger is great, as is the shawarma, Gyro, dolmas, etc.   It's been very consistent and the people are always friendly. Prices are reasonable, and it's a great Chicago style Greek place."}
{"text":"Lots of good Pita joints in town, this fits into that group.  Nice quality meat, and the tzatziki sauce was good.  I'd definitely stop in for a Gyro if in the area again."}
{"text":"Wow what a fantastic meal my family and I had today!! From the foule,falafel,tabouli,lamb kabob and chicken kabob words cannot describe how great it was. The owners are very welcoming and treated us like family."}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent authentic quality food and amazing service! Every time we come in we're greeted like family. This is our go to spot!"}
{"text":"I ordered two gyro. I found the meat to be so-so. The tzatziki sauce was OK.   It says shaved meat on the menu, but to me they looked like the precut slices of gyro meat not shaved off a spit."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. We went there for lunch while at the comic shop around the corner and with a coupon got a decent amount for an adorable price. And the food was delicious. Good customer service, too."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious !!! The steak was tender & the chicken juicy . Their spices are great & favorable . The portion of food is outstanding . You have to try the baklava the staff was awesome!!! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"The gyro which i love gyros was awesome full of meat and flavor with tomatoes onoin and oh how i love the zita sauce yummy best gyro i have had anywhere in the valley for sure. The service was good and the place was clean and i would recommend them to all cant wait to try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Amazing Spot! I go there? pretty much whenever? I get a chance to get out to east Mesa?.  Food is super inexpensive ?and has always been delicious?.  The dining? room is nice, and the staff is friendly enough, but I only go there for the food.  Because the chicken shwarma is just killer.?  In fact,?? just writing this review, makes me hungry, an I just made plans to go there tomorrow for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm just going to start out by saying that this place is more like the Most Valuable Restaurant (MVR). They have a great selection of traditional items you would find at a Greek restaurant as well as quirky off shoots such as a Gyro kofta burger and MVP fries. I had the burger and it was amazing with the tzatziki sauce. The fries are a must! Feta, herbs lemon, and garlic flavors make it a great addition to any dish! Wonderfully nice staff that are ready with suggestions and they come to your table to make sure everything is great! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow! Very nice find. I had humus, lentil soup and stuffed grape leaves. It was fantastic. Spiced just right and priced just right. I will be a regular."}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean food.  I have trouble choosing between the Heroburger. A delicious cheeseburger piled high with gyro meat and fresh toppings. Huge burger!  Or the lamb kebab. Succulent pieces of grilled lamb so tender they melt in your mouth!  And get this... $11 bucks for a lamb dinner in Mesa! My wife loves the chicken schwarma.  And we are both nuts for the mvp fries. Well spiced with a generous handful of feta cheese.  Btw. They deliver and they are quick! We have never gotten cold food.   Only negative is the deserts. Overly sweet. Not crispy and both times slightly stale. Shame really because I really want to give them a five!"}
{"text":"Just came here for the 1st time & I'm super impressed with their service! From the get go when I walked in, super friendly, helpful great customer service & delicious food!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE their gyros, french fries and tzatziki. Staff are friendly and the restaurant has been clean each time I have been there."}
{"text":"We got several things off the menu, the price was reasonable the staff was friendly all the food was good aside from desert. Only one of us enjoyed that. I have definitely have better. I would still fully recommend eating here, just skip desert!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this place out for a while, so I thought I'd stop in for lunch.  The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the place was clean.  I ordered a gyro pita pocket with a side of rice.  The lamb and beef were tender and tasty.  Rice was average.  I got that and a fountain drink for just about 9 bucks.  Not a bad deal.  I will be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and a very clean restaurant. We had a great experience here! The hero burger with cucumber yogurt is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is horrifying joke. I stopped going but my bf continued to go and every time they told him to have his gf take down her review. Today they evil woman from the first experience tells my bf my review was full of lies, not a single one, and if he didn't have me take it down he wouldn't be aloud in. I called to ask the owner or manager about it and he first apologizes for not giving me the flat bread we paid for, a extremely common occurrence, and I asked him about them telling my bf he would be banned for my review. He says we continue to order there while having the review up and I tell him it it's not my choice I'm not the one who eats there and he told me my bf ordered me food which is true but always when I'm asleep and most times I don't eat it because half the salads my bf bring me are filled with wrotten vegetables. Thankfully my bf has decided to stop being lazy and go to one of the many other Greek places with similar food and edible vegetables where we may recieve side items we order. Ps mvpita, you can't ban someone because someone they know wrote a yelp review about you, oh wait I guess you can it's just horrible business practice and incredibly rude, but that's what you do best. Order some fresh freaking vegetables man and stop hurancing customers gosh, he said he'd deliver the pita to my house before he banned me for critisizi NV his vegetables but as much as they hurrassed my bf I don't want you knowing where I live  God knows what your willing to do to remove a yelp review."}
{"text":"Super cheap, super good service, great meats and a free baklava...what else do you want?! lol.  The Gyro is only $3.99 on Monday and Tuesday. The total bill for a gyro, falafel, fries and baklava was seven bucks...seriously. The only downer was I was hoping for sauce to did falafel in, and that being said they were super busy and my order was to-go...most likely just forgotten in the bag. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered from them for the first time tonight. Delicious! Super huge portions for the money. Will definitely order from there again!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp and decided to stop by for dinner. Glad we did everything was fresh and tasty. Excellent and friendly service."}
{"text":"Best falafel in AZ. I am vegetarian and a falafel aficionado. Falafel is so hard to get right. MVPita's falafel is fantastic. Everything is fresh and flavorful. My family was fighting over the pita. The baklava is delicious. And the staff is very kind and welcoming. This is our new family favorite!"}
{"text":"My friend and I just happened to find this place on Yelp  after an exploratory drive in the Superstition Mountain area.   I'm a vegan which limits my options somewhat when looking for a place to eat in a new area.  I felt comfortable right away when I shared my dietary preference worth the counter man.  And I went ahead and ordered the MVPita Veggie Platter which included Fresh Tabouli. Hummus, Baba Ghanioush, Dolma and Falafel with pita.  When we got our food I ate some Falafel and was blown away by its taste and outer crispness. It was as close to perfect as I could imagine.  And as I sampled each of the other items on the plate my palate was pleasantly excited!   Everything was exceedingly excellent including the service.   If you love Mediterranean food as much as I do you need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is great! I have to say I was surprised. I'm not much of a meat person but their Chicken and steak are the best! My whole family loved it! Prices are good too!"}
{"text":"My son and I eat here at least twice a week.  This is the best Greek food we have found in the area, not to mention the best service.  They treat us like family. The falafel pita is my favorite, the tazikhi is to die for and you have to try the MVP fries when you are there!   We love this place.  Nothing like great food and superior service.  Way to go MVPITA, keep it up."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The shawarma is my go to dish. The pita are always super soft and fresh and the tzatziki is the best! The associates are really friendly every time. You have to try the MVP fries too, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were a big group headed to MVPita, and it was the last night that most of us would be in Phoenix. I was already full from a meal earlier in the day, so I do wish I was able to order more because I really enjoyed what I did eat.  I ordered the bean salad. I forget the name of it on the menu, but it was a mixture of beans in a lemon-flavored broth. A few of us used the yelp check-in deal for the baklava, and the restaurant ended up bringing baklava for the whole table, which was super sweet. Their baklava was great, and they used pistachios instead of walnuts.   I liked my bean salad. The lemon flavor was a great balance to the mix of beans."}
{"text":"good gyros, spicy hummus was delicious. Ill try again"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food served quickly. I am particularly fond of the backlava. They don't mind explaining to you what is in some of the dishes that they serve and for me that's very important. They take the time to explain how the food is prepared. All in all a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Took my family.   Tried 3 different entries and of course the fries!   Everything was fresh and delicious!   This is my new favorite place to go eat in or take out.  And they deliver to my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Wow! I have passed this place daily for two years and finally tried it. So fresh and delusions!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I have a hard time finding vegan options around where I live, but this place is less than ten minutes away and is so good! I always get the veggie plate. The falafels are sooooo good. I usually don't like falafels because they tend to be so dry, almost tasting burned and charred. But theirs aren't dry at all and have a lot of flavor. I need to come here more often!"}
{"text":"This was a delicious place. I came a few months ago. They have the best falafel I've ever tasted. Everything was delicious. I live a little closer now so I will definitely try to make it again. I came with a friend of mine who had never had Mediterranean food and she liked it too, although she says she would have to get used to it."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write this for a while. Ordered the falafel salad (no feta) & MVP fries w/o feta (vegan here)  Everything was excellent. Next time I will definitely try the hummus!"}
{"text":"I didn't believe it, the reviews on here. No way. Not for this little place in East Mesa. And yet there it is, five stars.  We ordered from postmates and had it delivered since we were just outside their delivery area. Hummus, falafel, a gyro pita, three meat sampler (gyro, chicken shawarma, and kafta. The MVP fries (based on the reviews, just get them) and baklava for good measure.  I'm a huge fan of falafel, and drive from power road to haja baba in Tempe just for a snack. I no longer have to do that, not even that but I can have it delivered! The chicken shawarma was really good, kafta ok, gyro was bomb. But come on, those prices are amazing for the quality of the food. Even the tzatziki was above average. I'm excited to have a restaurant of such quality in the area, no joke. If you live nearby try it out. I've been to mediterranean restaurants all over the valley and this would be in the top five. I almost can't believe I'm typing that as it's such an unassuming place. But there you go.  Thanks MVPita for bringing great food to NE Mesa!!  (Always get baklava, always....)"}
{"text":"This place is spot on! They have delicious Mediterranean food and you get lots of it! We got a 2 meat platter, gyros and kabobs, rice, salad and humus with a pita too! It was freshly made and brought out to us by the owner who by the way, is super nice AND from Chicago!  He also treated us to baklava which was the best I've ever had!  It's our new go-to place for great food.  You won't be disappointed.  Try it once.  You'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food here is nothing short of amazing! Extremely tasty. Vegan friendly. The falafel and Dolma are too notch. Their hummus is phenomenal. Most important the food quality is consistent with every visit. The friendly staff is the icing on the cake for me. I feel like I'm visiting a family owned establishment. Great vibes"}
{"text":"I shared a combo platter with a friend including chicken shawarma, kefta kabob, gyro, MVP fries (seasons fries topped with feta), and spicy hummus. The food was adequate--I'd say the kefta kabob, gyro, and MVP fries were the best of the choices. I wouldn't do the chicken again as it had way too much salt and lemon. as for he spicy hummus, it was tasty but not authentic at all whatsoever. I also had the baklava which was pretty subpar but not the worst I've ever had...If you're going for authenticity, this is not the place, but they do provide a relatively satisfying meal. Even with sharing, I was really full so you get a good bang for your buck, but maybe not the most authentic Middle Eastern meal. In other words, it's deff quite a few steps up barely edible but a good few steps down for nomsnoms delicioso! Other than the food--they have nice/quick customer service, ample seating, and a parking lot."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Very simply said...excellent food and over the top service! Family run operations. Every time we visit, everything is perfect!! Thank you all so very much!"}
{"text":"Alright, we walked in to try this place out, but when I saw the two males in the kitchen with long facial hair and not covered, we walked out. This is very unsanitary. I don't want to eat hair."}
{"text":"Food was really good! We had Chicken shawarma  and gyros. It was our 1st time  so she offered us all baklava for desert. Server was awesome. We will be back when in the Mesa area."}
{"text":"I visited on 2/16/18 for the first time.  I like the place as far as a gyro place is concerned.  Not a fancy place, you order at a counter and go sit down.  I had high hopes for the Hero Burger, having had a similar burger in San Diego at Western Steakburger. It was sadly not up to par with my previous experience, but it wasn't bad.  Just a simple thin burger patty with some delicious gyros meat on top.  But the Burger itself left a little to be desired.  I will try the gyro sandwich or swarma next time.    I also didn't fall in love with the MVP Fries.  The feta and the lemon drizzle just didn't work for me.  I can see it would be a favorite though.  Overall it was good though."}
{"text":"We had 3 of the 2 plate combos. First and foremost let me tell you that I only have it 4 stars because of the prices. $60 for three of us to eat there is a little steep.  HOWEVER, we will definitely be going back because the food is AMAZING.  One of us had the chicken schwarma and shish kefta, one had shish kefta and shish kebab and the other had gyro and shish kefta. Every item we ate was delicious. GET the MVP fries (Greek-style fries with feta and lemon) you will not be disappointed. My two favorites are the chicken schwarma and the beef kebab but the others were good too, I just thought the schwarma and kebab had the best overall flavor. Someone got the spicy hummus and that too is a must. Great overall tastes just wish it were a bit less pricey is all. Awesome food, well done MVPita!!!"}
{"text":"Love it. My 1 st time here. Came with a group and the accommodated us perfectly. The person who took our order was very friendly and helpful when ordering."}
{"text":"Excellent. Falafel is legit. Gyro is some of the best. Baba ghanoush is a must! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the 2nd time everyone is so nice, food is great my only recommendation is that the pita bread is not warm or soft but the food is still delicious we will continue to eat here now more often seeing they deliver"}
{"text":"This place is our new go to spot! I was thoroughly overwhelmed with how delicious everything was. The prices are reasonable, the staff is friendly and it's very clean."}
{"text":"Great food and cheap. Can't go wrong here!  I ordered the pick 3 combo and got the steak and chicken kabob and falafel with rice and spicy hummus. Everything is super tasty.  Everyone that works there is super friendly.  I'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"The Best pitta place in town  with the best service love this place !!  Don't forget... Monday's and Tuesday's  gyros are $ 3.99"}
{"text":"I ordered food for a party at my home, and it could not have been better!  I ordered salad, hummus rice, pita bread, and a platter of steak and chicken.  They threw in a variety of sauces and baklava for everyone.  Everything was so delicious!  My group is made up of light eaters, but almost everyone went back for seconds and raved about the food. The people at MVPita were delightful to work with and so helpful with my order.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Mediterranean food in the east valley hands down. Awesome family owned vibe. They will remember you and your order. The food is excellent. I highly recommend the Kefta and lamb. Actually it's all good. This is in my weekly rotation and I'd eat there everyday if I allowed myself.  The atmosphere is really laid back. Great spot for lunch or dinner. I also love to call in my orders for pickup. Overall a must try.  Side note: They have been awarded best burger several times so you can bring your picky eater friends. Lol"}
{"text":"I ordered their MVPita sampler and added extra meat (Shish Kabob) to my sampler and 2 Baklava to go. When I called in to order my food, I was warned they were busy with a party at their restaurant. I was on hold for almost 5 minutes. The staff who answered the phone and the second staff who took my order were both very apologetic about it, which I can appreciate. Went in to grab my food, I was greeted right away. The place was nice and clean. They had 1 cook and looks like 3 waitresses working. I paid for my to go items and noticed that I wasn't charged for my extra meat and only 1 Baklava was on the receipt (I got a FREE Baklava because I checked in) so I checked with the staff if that was correct. She checked and said she did order me my extra meat and will make sure I get my 2 Baklava. Not only did I get 2, she hooked me up with 3! That was a great surprise! The food I ordered was missing a couple things - it states on the menu for their sampler that you get Hummus, Gyro, Chicken Shawarma, and Falafel. Served with pita. I would assume the Chicken Shawarma should have been a gyro? But I didn't get that. Instead I got Hummus, Chicken Shawarma, Falafel and my extra meat of Shish Kabob. I didn't get a Gyro nor my Pita. The Chicken Shawarma was ok - it was too lemony for my taste. On the other hand, the Kabob was delicious and well marinated and tender. The Fallafel was a little too dry and the Baklava was good but have had better - it was too sticky. I think too much syrup. It should be fluffy and not too gooey. I'm rooting for this plAce and will definitely come back another time and try it out again. Thanks for great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Very good, I have been here about 4 times now.  Lots of vegan options and substitutions as well.  Very friendly staff, and when I call my order in ahead of time it's usually done within a minutes of me arriving.  Nice atmosphere as well.  The falafel is fresh and hand rolled to order, pair it up with their house made hot sauce and it's a great combo.  Also add the \"MVP Fries\" to any order and it's always a good choice.  Try them out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by the high ratings on Yelp. The atmosphere was nice, but the food was just mediocre. I have eaten my share of gyros and Mediterranean food and this was just average."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here twice. Both times I was really impressed with the food quality. I was not a big fan of the hummus, however, which I thought was way to watery and flavorless. The falafel, rice, and chicken shawarma are to die for tho!"}
{"text":"We ordered pickup tonight and I was early, so i had to wait a few minutes until my food was ready. I think they felt bad I had to wait, so they threw in free Baklava and were giving out roses for Mothers Day, how sweet!"}
{"text":"Try MV Pita for the first time today.  I had the chicken kabob plate with the MVP fries.    Everything was wonderful!  Quick service and the food was excellent.     I see MV Pita to be a weekly stop, if not more often."}
{"text":"I have yet to have any bad food at MVPita.  I especially love the Dolmas, Spinach Pie and Chicken Schwarma."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Expected it to be pricey, but you are getting what you pay for. It is worth it! Take the splurge and go. You will not be disappointed. Or even order out for 3rd party delivery if you don't want to leave the house. Just Do It!"}
{"text":"Ordered the MVP fries. I wanted to like them but the fries were cold and the chicken was dry. I don't know if I'd want to spend another 7$ on cold dry food. Still in search of my \"go to place\"!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite after officiating a game at Red Mountain High School where I Picked up a flyer from the concession stand. The person that greeted us was great. Helped with the selection and explained info regarding various dishes. Atmosphere and decor is awesome. The food was fresh and good......and a complimentary dessert. They are new to the area so please stop in and have a delicious meal. I'll be back in a couple of days for lunch."}
{"text":"Christian, the owner was the first person we talked to when we arrived. Incredibly informative and had great recommendations. Food is delicious. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'll be coming back. I got the 2 option plate with Gyro and lamb, spicy hummus  and crisp pita bread and MVP upgraded fries. Washed it down with a lemonade and finished it off with baklava."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food in all of the east valley is here. Look for my review on Google Maps! I love coming here on random weekends and paid days off."}
{"text":"Oh my ghanoush. Amazing food and service. Love the spicy  humus. Also love the baba ghanoush. Best Mediterranean food here in Phoenix. They also have a happy hour! Yummy. Healthy and scrumptious."}
{"text":"Good Monday and Tuesday gyro special. 3.99. Portions are good.   Fries are an additional add on and are not great, but okay if want something with meal. Free baklava with check in."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with whatever meat choice you choose; everything is seasoned well and tender. They have the best pita's in the valley as well. Good selection of beer for your taste buds and the services has always been great. Homemade tzatziki sauce, garlic sauce (my favorite), and hummus; spice (a favorite) and traditional. Chicago owned family business!! Highly recommeded if you are in the area. This is our families go to place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. I  love everything in the menu, lamb kebap is awesome, even their burgers are so good my kids always order and finish them all(which is rare). I hope they open multiple locations so i get to visit all of them when i am running around the valley. Thanks MVP!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!! Came here for dinner on a business trip and was pleasantly surprised to find MVPita. Great food, great price, easy to get to. I will definitely be back if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"So for consitancy they have surpassed all other gyros stops I would stop at, all bomb always giving out the best baklava what!!!! Yelper friendliness to the max!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Every time I am in town I eat here at least twice.  Everything tastes so fresh and delicious.  My favorites so far are the chicken kabob, tabbouleh, tzatziki, and it is a difficult decision as to whether I have the fries or rice - like them both.  The Owner and workers are friendly and attentive.  My husband, a native New Yorker, thought the chicken kabob was excellent and even admitted/agreed with me that it is better than a Greek place we frequent weekly in NYC."}
{"text":"Good food, I enjoyed the falafel pita. Just disappointed that they advertised free baklava with check in and then were out of it, even though they had just opened for the day."}
{"text":"I've only been once so far but i plan on trying everything. I had the steak shish kabob and was blown away by how good the beef was. Also their house dressing for their salad was better than other Mediterranean restaurants I've had. I can't wait to try their gyro meat and lamb.   Update: I went twice in today. Gyro sandwich for lunch and lamb plate for dinner. Stop your search for food, MVPita is all you need in life. They are cooking up some amazing food here and I just learned that there burger won best burger in Mesa this year so I'll have to try that next!  I promise you the lamb and shish will not disappoint! Get the Fries!"}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, the girl who took my order was very helpful. Apparently, the Falafel and Shawarma are the most popular dishes. I've had them both and they're good, so I decided to try something different. They have a \"hero\" burger made with kefta meat, topped with grilled onions AND gyro meat. Oh, that sounds interesting, sure, sold!  I added the MVP fries (topped with feta and garlic) and a drink.  The burger was cooked well and the produce seemed fresh. The addition of the gyro meat was interesting and worth a try if you are a fan of gyros. The bun had a nice texture: t had a nice \"chew\" and was not too soft so that it was falling apart around the burger while I ate it. This bun did a good job of staying together.  The fries with feta on them were tasty, but I was left with a rather large pile of feta on the plate after my fries were gone, despite my best efforts at using fries as chopsticks to eat the larger pieces. I would suggest using smaller feta crumbles and even using less cheese so that what comes ON the fries sticks to the fries :)  Overall, I like the falafel better, but the burger and fries hit the spot this trip.  I'll be back to eat more falafel, or maybe try something else I haven't had yet."}
{"text":"Excellent food in a somewhat dated and dark setting, but I think some remodeling is on the schedule. We're had a variety of their Mediterranean fare and it's all been good. Reasonably priced and fairly convenient in north east Mesa MV has become a fav of ours."}
{"text":"Our family won two MVPita gift certificates totaling $45 when we attended Aviation Fascination at Falcon Field recently.  We decided to try MVPita a few nights ago (no risk to us as it was essentially free).  What an absolute pleasant surprise!  The food was amazing, the staff was friendly and welcoming, and our overall experience was perfect.  Four adults and a toddler ate for $45 (in gift certificates) and left stuffed.  They were even kind enough to throw in 4 baklavas on the house! Amazing!  Can't recommend them enough! Go see them. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has food that is really great. It truly lives up to its name of MVP. I thought the name was kind of goofy until I ate there. It's in the old Barro's so it has plenty of dining area. Like many Greek places it is either family owned or they hired a bunch of people that look and act like family. They are very keen on making sure you're happy. So it's got the small restaurant feel in a pretty spacious place. Prices are extremely reasonable and there's quite a bit of food you get with your order. Really clean place as well and they are constantly clearing and cleaning plates left behind in the dining room."}
{"text":"My family and I came here tonight and I have to say it was a wonderful experience. The waitress was the so wonderful, there was a small wait that we experienced for our food.... But we didn't even notice. She came to apologize for the wait, and so did the cook. This is a new favorite for us and we love that this is family owned.   Just want to say thank you for the wonderful service from everyone there!"}
{"text":"Found this place when I was vegan-for-a-month. MVPita was like life savior at that point. The veggie options are fantastic (veggie sampler) and much more exciting then the vegan options I was making at home. I also always make a point to grab extra hummus for a future snack. I've always ordered to go and the wait time is small. Even not being a vegan, I still love it- so that should tell you something."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to my husband and I because we love a good Greek restaurant. I do have to say the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the front counter gal recommended their fries with garlic, lemon, and feta to us, and the fries were excellent! However, my husband was less than impressed with the gyro he ordered. He felt that the gyro lacked flavor, and that the gyro meat wasn't crispy either. I ordered a Greek salad with Chicken which is my usual starting place for any Greek restaurant, and again I was just not impressed. It was okay, but the chicken lacked flavor, and I felt the same way about the salad overall. I don't think we will return unless its to get an order of the fries, I could definitely crave those."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  I came here with my kids, husband, and parents in February '16.  The food and service were both excellent.  This family-owned business has a great vibe. There are a lot of vegetarian options and the serving sizes are generous.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great Shish Kabob! Wonderful Falafel. Can't wait to go back and try some more!  Glad to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times since it's opening. They're always very polite and the interior decorating is appealing. Their catchphrases are gag-worthy, unlike their food. \"Don't feel awful, eat our falafel,\" and \"hummus where the heart is.\" They've always offered complimentary dessert after asking how my meal was. The falafel is by far the best I've had, but the same can't be said for their hummus or gyros. I'll be returning whenever I feel awful."}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars because the food is top notch. Fresh, made from scratch everything!  The falafel is the best I've ever had!  Homemade pita, tzaziki sauce. And their baklava is melt in your mouth!  They did forget the pickles I asked to add to my sandwich. Otherwise amazing food and service. Plus they deliver so i will definitely be eating this food again and again!"}
{"text":"After our soccer tournament we weren't sure where to eat or what was around. We used Yelp and found this place had almost 50 reviews and 4.5 stars. Wow! Decided to try it and I know why they have such success with their reviews. The staff was helpful with ordering and suggestive on dishes and very friendly. The hummus was one of the best I had ever and the chicken kabob was flavorful, juicy and delicious! We had a Party of 6 and everyone loved what they ordered, even the kids. We wanted to eat it the next day again!"}
{"text":"Great original place to try! 2nd time eating here and this time i decided to order out and pick up. I got the hero burger and wow it was delicious. My girl got the house salad with kefta and she enjoyed it. I will definitely make this place a regular spot for dinner. Oh and the MVP Fries bomb!"}
{"text":"MVPita is a new restaurant that just opened in November. MVP was affordable. I got a two item: chicken shawarma and shish kabob plate and my wife got a falafel pita pocket all for around $18. Mine came with salad and MVP French fries.  Defiantly worth a visit if your craving a healthy meal packed full of flavor.  The French fries and the Steak Shish Kabob were the clear standouts for me.  My Wife said the falafel pita was not bad but nothing special.  The steak kabob was good enough for me to want to come back."}
{"text":"Wow! Ordered a Hero Burger (gyro/sauce/and cheeseburger) w feta cheese fries...fantastic! Free baklava to top it off, plus leftovers for breakfast. On top of that...friendly service!"}
{"text":"What a neat spot to have Greek/Middle Eastern food. The service was great, the price was decent and they have a huge menu. I tried the Chicken Shwarma which was flavored great! My friend got a salad that was plentiful. I cannot wait to go back"}
{"text":"I was on my way to visit a friend and realized that my stomach was rumbling. Thank you to my Yelp family that led me to this nearby gem. The Gyro was amazing and piping hot. I also had the delight to try their MVP Fries. I've been back a few other times and every time this place delivers tasty fresh food."}
{"text":"good food and fair price. I highly recommend this place if u would like some Greek food for dinner. I love the Gyro btw"}
{"text":"Their chicken Shwarma tasted like a bad indian chicken dish, Their baklava was hard and didn't have that honey taste (more bland sugar syrup taste), but I did get a good deal on my car insurance"}
{"text":"This place is freaking good. The gyros are loaded with meat. The baklava is super tasty. The prices are good. You feel like you get your money's worth here, which is always good when you're out to eat. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Stopped while back in town visiting family. Looks like I moved right about the time you opened.   The hummus is amazing!!   Will def be back."}
{"text":"Food is great, but I have to say the service is what I love the most. They are excellent. On my first visit I received a free dessert. The item I tried came with pistachios which I don't like, so naturally I ordered it without the nuts. Then a week later I came in to try the 3.99 gyro. I ordered a dessert again and went and sat down. I ate my meal and then they brought me my dessert at the end. When the employee brought it to me they said that a cook remembered me from last week and that I didn't like pistachios so they made it without (I had forgotten to mention it during my order). Fantastic service. I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place in town to get a gyro. Hummus is great as well! Do not hesitate to come here to eat!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time tonight. Cashier was friendly and knowledgeable explaining the dishes offered and helping us choose our meals. Settled on stuffed grape leaves for the starter , and chicken shawarma and steak kabobs as our dinner.  My boyfriend was happy-said the shawarma was the closest that he has found so far in Arizona to what he used to get when he live in Jeddah. The kabob was awesome and so was the hummus and rice that came on the side (they give you a choice of like six different sides).  Am super glad we found this place as they deliver as well as offer dine in ( nice to have options besides pizza). Also since it was our first time there  at the close of out meal they gave us a free dessert.  Over all was pleasantly surprised, and the best part for me is that it is close to my home so no long drive."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took us so long to finally go here.  Now we are hooked!  The staff is ALWAYS friendly and helpful.  The food is amazing!  I LOVE the chicken shawarma.  It is very flavorful and garlicky.  Everything I have tried there so far was great, but I keep going back to the shawarma.  The lemon chicken soup is also wonderful, and reminds me of my grandpa's soup, from when I was a kid.  If you love garlic, try the garlic sauce for your pita.  It is POTENT, but delicious."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!! My fiancé and I love Greek food and this is my new favorite place. Family owned and run and they have the best service! Everything we've had is absolutely delicious! The falafel is fresh and crispy. I DIE for their salad dressing it is a Greek dressing but tastes like there is some balsamic vinegar in it. I always get the chicken kebab and it turns out most and flavorful each time. I'm excited to see MV Pita prosper they definitely deserve it!"}
{"text":"Tried a salad with chicken, the chicken was moist and the salad was more than I could eat. This place is clean and reasonably priced. I will put this on my list to try again."}
{"text":"The meal was outstanding!! Dolmas, gyros, and the baklava are all fresh made, and delicious! Service was on point!"}
{"text":"Brand new place.  Grabbed lunch and were blown away.  We agreed they served the best falafel we've ever had.  The dolmas and lentil soup were outstanding!  We pretty much loved it all.... the chicken kabobs and the hummus, the baklava and the kinafa..... Service friendly and the place was clean and comfortable.  Great price for fresh, yummy food.  Can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent customer service! Seriously the most people and friendly staff- I think it might even be family owned. AMAZING."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, came out quickly, and the staff was super friendly. The manager, Ray, even made a point to introduce himself and ask me and my boyfriend our names after asking how we enjoyed the meal. A great experience all around!"}
{"text":"Great meal! There was 3 of us, each ordering different  meals so we could get a taste. It was all delish!Great service from when we walked in the door."}
{"text":"Ordered on Eat24. Food was ready at estimated time (which was 22 minutes from the time I ordered). Ordered the MVP Combo plate with the gyro, shish kebab, salad and rice. Gyro meat was like any other gyro meat. I've had better and more flavorful at other places. The shish kebab, on the other hand,  was very flavorful and tender 5/5. The rice was rather bland for my taste. The pita was pretty good too and the tzatziki sauce was actually really good. I definitely recommend ordering another pita and tzatziki sauce. I'll likely go back, it wasn't bad for the price. 4/5."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!!   It's our go to place and we are so glad it just down the street."}
{"text":"Very good middle eastern food.  The falafel were excellent. Tahini had just the right amount of lemon in it. I liked the hummus because it wasn't too garlicky. My husband ordered the 3 item platter and all items were excellent.  The portion sizes are generous.  They've put in some nice woodwork in the front of the store which makes the atmosphere nice. This is a family run restaurant and their personal pride can bee seen here. If you want a good meal, I'd recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow this place was amazing! As soon as I walked in the atmosphere was so nice! The workers are the nicest people ! And the food was inexpensive and delicious! I even got a free dessert!"}
{"text":"The best burger I have had in soo long fresh ingredients and perfect customer service."}
{"text":"my son and I went to Mvpita today.  I work in the area and we decided on this place.  We were greeted warmly, very much appreciated.  I ordered the falafel...very good!  my son had his first gyro he loved it.  I would not only return but I would recommend Mvpita to my colleagues!  Great job...wishes for your success."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food overall. Good helpings of each item. Got my take out order correct and on time. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Shut. Up. My daughter is home sick today, so I needed delivery and I was craving anything but pizza, lol. MVPita came up and Greek sounded good, plus they deliver- score. I ordered the falafel pita, greek fries, and the house salad with extra feta on the side. That falafel. OMG. So flavorful, a little spicy but just enough to taste not burn, crispy, and soooo good! The tzatziki was a perfect compliment to the pita. The salad was HUGE and delicious. After devouring the pita, I only took a couple of bites of salad. The rest will be dinner. Yummo. Can we talk about the fries though? Perfection. There's lemon, feta, and some spices on them. Despite being delivered and in Styrofoam packaging, they were still extra crispy and hot. Perfect. With delivery, my total was just over $14. Incredible price for amazing food. I will absolutely be back with the kids and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Score! This family run restaurant was such a great find. The nicest staff and fantastic food. You order when you walk in and they bring you your food when it is ready. Everything we ordered was superb. My falafels were the best I have ever had- not dry like lots of places serve. The dolma were delicious, and the lentil soup was exceptional.  Portion sizes are very generous, none of us could make it through our meals. And we used yelp for a free baklava. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Gyro was amazing and so was the falafel. Tried the baklava after lunch and it was probably the best I've ever had. Very clean restaurant and the staff goes out of their way to answer your questions and give you their recommendations. I'm not on this side of town often but I'll definitely be going out of my way to stop here in the future!"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food and is now our go to   Mediterranean restaurant in East mesa. Our favorites are the chicken shwarma and steak kabobs."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and dining experience! One of the best Gyros in the valley. Oh, and don't forget to order their fries...super good!"}
{"text":"They are te best in East Mesa . Food is great, healthy and home made. Service. Wonderful.  I go there all the time"}
{"text":"Greeted with a smile, lady was very knowledgeable on menu. We ended up getting what she recommended.  The chicken shawarma pita and the plate. They even brought out a side of all there sauces for us to try"}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time. I'm a celiac vegetarian and my husband eats meat, yet they had tons of menu items for both of us. Really good flavor, friendly staff, and relaxed ambiance. Loved it."}
{"text":"The MVP fries are amazing!! I crave them all the time! And so is the chicken shawarma. Honestly it's all pretty good, plus they have a rewards program where you get free stuff all the time, yay!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and the service is fantastic. You can tell everything is very fresh and that they are proud of what they make. The sauces are all homemade hot fresh pita bread and the hummus is excellent. Basically you can't do wrong here meats were all fantastic as well!"}
