{"text":"The most amazing Southern Pecan Pie! This Thanksgiving my family embraced the not too sweet but perfectly moist and delicious  pecan pie from Breadcrafters Bakery. We all loved it! Even those non-pecan fans...  If you're looking for wholesome goodnees and unique flavor, you must visit Breadcrafters Bakery and experience all they have to offer. You will never be disappointed. Enjoy!

Thank you Monica!"}
{"text":"Incredible baked goods...had the blueberry sourcream muffin,  so moist and had a nice crust on it...wish they had a location in Napa!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I tried this place for the first time this morning and what a great find!!  The food was fresh and tasted wonderful!  There are alot of healthy options available and the bakery is off the charts!  They have everything you want and more :).  I would recommend this place as a regular spot for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Myeh. Broken wifi, and the cappuccino I ordered was just an espresso shot in a cup of hot milk.

But that chocolate chip muffin was REALLY good."}
{"text":"The food was great. I was impressed with everything I tried. In fact I think their food is way too good to be served in/on styrofoam. Their dinning area it's very small, but they have a lovely, shaded, patio, and I wonder why they don't put a little more effort into their presentation and order of service. Right now, this is a great place to eat by yourself on your lunch break; with a little showmanship, it could be a popping lunch/meeting place. I also think they should ditch passport for a better coffee and tea offering to boost their morning business."}
{"text":"We just went to this breakfast/lunch place this afternoon. It is really good, and it always has been. I love getting a plain turkey sandwich and it is always amazing! They have many types of sandwiches from a breakfast egg sandwich to a turkey sandwich. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I give them a 3 star overall because although their food is excellent (LOVE their cinnamon rolls and other pastries, sandwiches are oh-so good!) their service is not so much. The lady who owns the place ALWAYS seems so in a rush to help someone else (even though none is behind me) or get back in the kitchen and just isn't very nice. I don't think the food is THAT worth it to be treated poorly."}
{"text":"Great food. Small dining area."}
{"text":"Wow! Another great meal here!  Wifey had the \"Twisted Turkey\" (turkey, cranberry, cream cheese, cucumbers on raisin walnut bread) which was really amazing!  I had a roast beast on french roll.  Fresh meats, great service.  The young guys working the counter were very knowledgeable about the menu and had great recommendations.

Lots of great looking salads in the case too.

Previously had the pulled pork sammie (breakfast) which was also amazing.  Breakfast closes at 11:30.

One thing though: They sell out of their fresh breads pretty early (at least on the weekends).  We were there at 12:30 and there was only 3 or 4 loaves left.

We had a sample of the Swiss Cheese and Pepper bread (only on Saturdays) and it was very good... lots of pepper.  Would make a great grilled cheese, IMO."}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews I decided to finally give this place a try. Came in on a Friday during lunch hour... Big mistake. I waited about 15 minutes for one sandwich. There was no where really to wait for your food the inside is very small. I got a #6 it was ok I've had better. Oh and they forgot my pickle...."}
{"text":"If you've ever been in the restaurant business, then you'll really appreciate this cafe, especially if you like fresh baked breads.  It looks like everything is created and baked in-house and they do a fantastic job at it.  It's well worth the wait, but it's best to arrive and order early as it gets very busy at lunch."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim after discovering the restaurant we were originally headed to had closed.  We've come back twice since and absolutely love the sandwiches we've ordered.  Everything has been delicious, and the sandwiches are so big I always get a second meal out of the full size.

The service is a little slow but I don't mind waiting for tasty, freshly made sandwiches, and all of the employees are nice and helpful. 

The downside is the cost of the kids meals.  It costs $6 for a PBJ sandwich and a bag of chips (or small serving of fruit, etc.).  McAllister's offers a PBJ, chips, and bag of cookies for $1.50.  Even Chop Shop (which is more on par with the quality of Breadcrafters) offers an identical meal for $4.  We'd probably be weekly visitors to Breadcrafters if it didn't cost $12 to feed our kids a couple of PBJ sandwiches."}
{"text":"Breadcrafters! What is this??  If you don't know, then come check this place out!!  This place is so amazing to come eat breakfast, lunch, and even for dinner if you wanna just come and grab it... come in and indulge your self with some homemade luv'n cookn' especially their breads, and omgoodness,  the is Santa Fe breakfast burrito, is da bomb, everything is all fresh and homemade!  Their salads, their soups, their desserts, organic teas..... i have not been disappointed yet, so if you do not have time to enjoy.... then call in your order for pick up or call in for catering and they will cater to you!   If you do not have time during week days then come out on the weekends, a guarantee to your satisfaction! !  Right across from PV Mall, SE side of Larkspur and Tatum, literally across from Wendy's, the not so healthy foods!"}
{"text":"They have pretty good food. I love the soup and sandwiches but i will not be coming here because of the rude owner. she is there every day and never actually listens to what you want. She doesn't care about your order. She got a whole to go order ready while I was standing there to pay when I had ordered way before that. It's every time I go in there she's not a nice person. She ruins going there and that's a bummer because they have awesome food but I won't go somewhere with rude people! Not worth it or she doesn't deserve my money!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this little hole in the wall bakery today and absolutely loved it! After church errands always calls for a pit stop to a new lunch place. We couldn't be more impressed. From the kind people who worked there to the delicious sandwich we shared, our day was made by this awesome find.

{"text":"DO NOT ORDER YOUR HOLIDAY PIES AT BREADCRAFTERS!!

I made that mistake last Thanksgiving!!   I ordered a pumpkin pie and an apple cranberry pie.  We had family in from North Carolina and enjoyed a loverly dinner.  Then disaster struck.  I bit into my apple cranberry piece of pie and THERE WAS CHOCOLATE IN IT!!!  A whole layer of chocolate under the apple and cranberry.  I couldn't believe it and I was so embarrassed.  It tasted horrible.  The pumpkin pie was crappy too!!!    

To make matters worse I tried numerous times to contact the owner for a refund by phone and through their website and heard nothing then finally sent her a message through facebook!!   I heard back from her and she admitted to me they rarely check their email off the website - thats good business sense!. She asked me for my address to send the check to and gave it to her.  A couple weeks went by, received nothing so  I emailed my address again.  

To this day (June 14th) I still have not received a refund!!!  We used to lunch there once in a while but now WE WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!  And this year I will make my own pies!!!  Lesson Learned!!
It shows me that they do not care about their customers!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent.  Customer service needs improvement, not the most welcoming of staffs.  They seem to be in a mad rush all the time and yet the food seems to take a while."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for sandwiches and salads.  The staff here are the friendliest I have encountered since I moved to AZ (the staff must all be from somewhere else!).  The bakery items are also very good."}
{"text":"I was just in there today. And my friend and i saw that they had nothing in their cases (no food). We waited about 20 minutes to just order. We ended up leaving because the service was incredibly slow. Looks like they have a good menu, but won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"They will never have what you want so why waste your time going here.  They ALWAYS run out of main ingredients. I have gone 3 times with high hopes that management could figure out how to order but 3 out of 3 they proved their incompetence to manage... it's too bad considering their food looks and smells delecious..."}
{"text":"Been Going to bread crafters for awhile now and love the food but lately it's been terrible and the owner isn't the friendliest. I'll go back cause I hope things change and I love the raisin bread and chicken salad. If your looking for great service and good food this isn't the place and you can't count on amazing food and not good service."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great food, exceptional customer service, music set the tone for a great time to enjoy with my friend. Chose the sonora chicken salad, will definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Decent for what they are going for... better food than Subway, but not incredible.  Free wi-fi and free refills are a definite plus.

I was just looking for a place close to my apartment where I could get a healthy lunch while getting online to get some work done.  Being a Saturday around lunchtime, I was a little worried about finding a place that wasn't totally packed.  After trying quite a few places nearby that didn't have wi-fi (why not Floyd's Kitchen? How expensive is a router really?) I walked down the strip mall and found Breadcrafters.  I have co-workers that love this place, and they did have a place I would work (outside none the less, and we have to enjoy the weather here while we can!) so I got a salad and sat down to work.  

While the salad and a drink was $10, it was more than big enough to satisfy and they let me know I could get free refills.  No TV's, which could be a plus to some people, but I was hoping to watch the Bulls playoff game. I will come here again, when I'm in the right mood.  Next time the Bulls are playing however, look for me at Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"A real bakery (items not frozen or pre-packaged). Real small place. Unique breakfast and lunch offerings."}
{"text":"I love to come here for breakfast!  The pork and eggs sandwich is no longer on the menu (boo!), but they will still make it for you if you request it (yeah!).  I recently switched from the blueberry muffin to the blueberry scone (to save calories and sugar, right?!), and I was not at all disappointed.  Their chai tea latte is the best!  And I've ordered pies from Breadcrafters during the holidays, and everyone loved them!"}
{"text":"Wow, I had a half an egg salad sandwich and a bowl of the creamy chicken with rice soup. Their egg salad didn't have celery, so they diced some up and added it to my sandwich for me, how great!  Both the soup and sandwich were absolutely fantastic, I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Traveling in Phoenix and glad we found this cute little local place.   They make everything fresh and it shows.  I had the Eggs Benedict sandwich with one of the best hollandaise sauces I've had anywhere.  It is a bit spendy, but portions are huge.  Also had a great latte.  I would highly recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Perfectly made French Dip, the beef, baguette and au jous, were perfect. I have ordered this twice from Breadcrafters and each time was exceptional.   Fresh pastry selections are amazing. I tried the Creme brûlée with blue berries and it met all my expectations. 
Nice to have a local business that offers a wide variety of deli items, freshly made bread, yummy desserts and to top it off, a pet friendly patio!!"}
{"text":"First time here.  It's too bad the food is pretty good because the service is horrible. It wasn't busy and the cashier girl gave us such an attitude as we were trying to decide which bread we wanted (it only took us 2 seconds max).  Food took awhile which is fine because you can't rush good food, right?  Well, then the cashier girl forgot one of our items, made me wait while she helped more customers that walked in after I waited in line to get the item, gave me more attitude when I asked her for it and the gave me the greasiest looking soup imaginable.  It's too bad the other food items in our order are pretty good because we won't be back."}
{"text":"So here I am eating my third piece of Breadcrafters cheese bread slathered with parmesan pesto spread. Oh Breadcrafters, I love you. 

Stopped by here for the second time, and I must say it was even better the second time. I had a cinnamon roll and a iced coffee. The cinnamon roll was good, baked just enough, not overdone or doughy. My coffee was EXCELLENT. Apparantly it is their own blend.

My one issue was one employee (I'm assuming a manager) was noticeably rude to a girl that was washing the tables. Nothing puts me off more than somewhere that treats their employees poorly."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place!!! We went for a breakfast date and it was just amazing. The girls working there are so sweet and help so much. Every time we go the service is amazing. I was waiting for my husband there one morning and was sitting and the lady came over and was so sweet to ask me if she could get me anything while I waiting. Their breakfast is fantastic, I especially love the sour team muffins. No more paradise bakery for us!!!!"}
{"text":"Made the trek from Tempe on Sunday morning at 11.00am.  I figured that since the bakery closed at 3.00pm I would be in good shape...wrong.  They were out of muffins, breakfast breads and pastries and had only a few loaves of regular bread and dessert pastries left.  Very disappointing as you would think they would anticipate a busy Sunday brunch crowd.  Bought a baguette and headed out...and it was just meh...won't be heading back"}
{"text":"Great locally owned place with yummy food. A little expensive but worth the quality ingredients. I got their BLT and the bacon was great. Plus they have free Wi-Fi so I could work there in between my appointments. Not much in door seating so grab a table before you order."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and it was spectacular.  I had the ABLT and loved it.  My wife had the #9 chicken salad with the white bean chicken chili.

The bread was freshly made and I can't wait to go back.."}
{"text":"The tall blonde male I dealt with today was super rude. I was having trouble ordering and he was talking down about my confusion under his breath. I then called my wife to confirm her order and again he was talking smack about me not knowing what I wanted. After hanging up and hearing all of this from him. I said I was just going to go some other place and he yells good. The lady who is always there which I assume is the owner is very hard working and pleasant to deal with. 3/9/18 4pm"}
{"text":"Met some friends here and we had sandwiches and salads- I didn't get any pics but the other reviewers had pictures. Had the French dip and it was good - my friends had salads and they looked amazing and they loved them. The staff were wonderful and the outside patio was lovely!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. The employee was incredibly rude to us because we came near closing time. He had already began to close up and when we wanted something from the case he seemed incredibly annoyed that he actually had to do his job."}
{"text":"I went in here for the first time after reading reviews on Yelp and I'm glad I did! I got the turkey cranberry sandwich which tasted better than I expected, which I think is due to the fresh bread. There is a wide selection of sandwiches, soups, and pastries. I'll have to come back to try other options. And the guy working there was very friendly and helpful, and even offered me some suggestions."}
{"text":"Despite living in the area for close to a decade, lunch today was my first time at Breadcrafters. It's small, with little seating, but is also conveniently located across from the mall. This is a combo bakery/sandwich shop, though I was disappointed with the sandwich selection. I got the country club sandwich, but didn't want the swiss cheese that comes standard. I had to settle for colby over the cheddar I wanted; I was a little surprised that a sandwich shop would fail to have cheddar cheese. I also ordered the potato salad, which is definitely a different style than I'm used to. Instead of creamy, it was basically little block of potato--with skins--with a wee bit of dressing. It wasn't terrible, but I wish they would have described it in more detail than just saying it was \"potato salad.\" The sandwich itself wasn't bad, but wasn't memorable either. Either way, it didn't seem worth the $10 I spent there on a basic sandwich and drink."}
{"text":"My first lunch here. Had two friends with me, arrived at 1:00 pm and the majority of the lunch crowd was gone or leaving so we were able to get a table. Friends ordered sandwiches I had the Napa chicken salad. All was freshly prepared not taken out of a refrigerator case adding to the high quality presentation and flavor. The portions were not overly large but normal sized. All 3 of us were happy with our meals. Self serve ice tea (one lemonade) were fine. The \"freshly prepared\" means there's a bit of a wait so if you're in a real hurry this might not work for you....I'm getting into the \"slow food\" movement so, if the slow food is reflected in the quality it works for me."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp, visiting phoenix for the day.  I loved the green chili turkey sandwich.  The five girls I was with all enjoyed their meals, 3 got salads which looked amazing.  I felt the deserts needed a little something more(sugar?), we had a blueberry tart thing, and cream puff looking thing. The covered patio was enjoyable with greenery other attention to detail."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my mom after a movie for a sandwich. The roast beef sandwich was fine, nothing too exceptional. While we were there they ran out of almost every bread in the building. Doesn't their name have bread in it?! 

But, after being made fun of for our severe nut allergy by the employee when I asked if the pasta salad had nuts, I do not think we will be back."}
{"text":"Finally tried the breakfast here and it was amazing. Great house made chorizo in their burrito and the sandwiches are served on the house made breads. Always friendly folks working behind the counter."}
{"text":"I have been going to Breadcrafters for the past five years, and it is HANDS DOWN one of my all-time favorite sandwich spots in Phoenix! Here are some of my favorite food choices:

Sandwich: I typically build my own sandwich which I like to call Old Faithful. It is a perfect combination of turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato, with their parmesan pesto spread on a baguette. The parmesan pesto spread is OUT OF THIS WORLD - you haven't lived if you haven't tried it! Their chicken salad is also fantastic. They serve it with lettuce and tomato on their walnut raisin bread, and it is great! They have all kinds of great sandwich creations, all of which I've tried. I am being completely honest when I say I haven't had a bad sandwich at Breadcrafters.

Salads: My favorite is the Napa Valley chicken salad. It has sliced marinated chicken with bleu cheese crumbles and grapes and is served with a champagne vinegrette. It's delish!

Pastries: All the pastries are great, but I love their scones and muffins. They are huuuuge portions, so you could make a breakfast out of a scone and cup of coffee. Their desserts are out of this world as well. I highly recommend the apple fritter, brownie (insanely chocolatey), lemon raspberry bars, and their molten chocolate chip cookie (it's a dark chocolate cookie with raspberry).

Bread and Dips: My favorite breads are the sourdough, french country (a lighter sourdough), viennese (an egg bread), garlic parmesan and regular baguettes. The dips that they sell are beau monde (a delicious herb/dill dip that's great with veggies), parmesan pesto (my fave!), roasted onion gorgonzola (another fave), and an olive tapenade. 

As far as the service goes, everyone is always SUPER friendly. It's one of those \"cheers-esque\" places where everybody knows your name :) I will be a life-long customer, because this place really knows how to do good, fresh food!"}
{"text":"Really great! If you haven't been here before I highly recommend it. I worked as a cashier at REI, on the other side of the Paradise Valley Mall, and this place was the one spot I would regularly try to cram in a meal within a 30 minute window. 

Their desserts melt in your mouth, Their salads are HUGE, and always taste super fresh, and their sandwiches are great. But by far my favorite is their breakfast items. Their Benedict's Best is so delicious. 

I really would struggle to find anything less than amazing at this joint. Thumbs way up here."}
{"text":"Delicious, inspiring salads and sandwiches! I haven't had their soup yet, but the salads and sandwiches are fab! I hate boring salads that consist of mostly lettuce - these are salads with lots of great ingredients, made freshly!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was quick. But there is no reason I should pay over $7 for a Large soup and still be hungry. I had even purchased a bread bowl on the side to help. I feel like the prices are bigger then the food is worth."}
{"text":"I love everything I've eaten here. Everything. Okay, with the exception of the creme brulee, which was kind of soggy. But who goes to a sandwich shop to eat creme brulee? My favorites sandwiches are the turkey jack stack and the garden run. Oh, and the tuna egg and olive which is the special on Fridays. Their ingredients are fresh, delicious, and their flavors are dimensional. 4 stars for the occasional messed up orders/disorganization/whatever. But I still absolutely love them. PS) I overheard them say they were looking to move to the Arcadia area.

Generally I would stay away from the desserts because they are blah, but their sandwiches and salads are amazing. PS) When it comes to thanksgiving special order pies, I highly recommend their chocolate bourbon pecan pie (DEAR GOD was it good!) but NOT their pumpkin pie (which was weird and kind of had my guests looking at it like it came from walmart...which probably actually would have tasted better)."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place one day when I wanted a sandwich but knew I was out of bread at home.  I was waited on by the owner who was very friendly.  I ordered the ABLT which is a BLT with avocado.  It was possibly the best BLT I've ever had and had a ton of bacon.  I also got a mini pumpkin pie and it was to die for.  I then decided Breadcrafters would be doing the food for my Thanksgiving this year.  Their Turkey Day menu looks awesome.  Will edit this post after that.  I've been back with my kids.  The younger ones love the grilled cheese and sugar cookies.  They also have delicious looking salads and soups that I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, and the bread was delicious.  I got a veggie sandwich (the only one of the menu).  It was good, but nothing spectacular.  I ordered potato salad to go with my vegetarian sandwich...and it had BACON in it.  
When I asked if it had bacon, the person responded with a yes and did not offer to give me something else, despite my disgust at the fact that there was meat in the potato salad. The woman at the counter was very unpleasant.  I overheard another customer  tell her that she tried to call in her order but no one answered.  The woman working there said she was really busy and she didn't want to answer the phone when she had customers in front of her.  I couldn't believe it!  
I won't return here because I can spend my money for a veggie sandwich at another place where the people serving are actually nice."}
{"text":"Every time I go there I am extremely happy with service I get and the quality of the food. Anything I've ever ordered from there has been delicious, I would definitely recommend the Desert Cobb salad with spicy ranch dressing. They have tons of salads premaid, so you are able to be in and out quickly with your food. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop in town. It's worth the drive for the #9 sandwich alone...house roasted chicken breast shredded, almonds, grapes, and just the right amount of mayo on house-baked raisin walnut bread. It's large enough to split.
The desserts all look wonderfully fresh and delicious. 
Today we took home a loaf of the raisin walnut bread to enjoy over  the weekend. 
And the owner Angela; she's the real deal. GO, GO, GO to Breadcrafters and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Breadcrafters is a bit tucked out of the way, but it's worth the trip if you like hearty Old World style bread or just great sandwiches and other fresh baked goods.

The place is small, with just a few tables inside.  You might prefer to eat on the large covered patio outside.  Their food is very conducive to takeout too, they have ready-made salads and other foods you can take to go.

Once inside, you order and pay at the counter, and wait on the side (if it's to go) or you can sit at a table and they'll bring you the food when it's ready.

You'll be tempted by the delicious, homey baked goods in the glass case, as well as rustic homemade breads you can take home.  Yes, they taste as good as they look.

Items are a little pricey, but you're paying for quality.  And yes, the service is a little abrupt and business-like, but it's not Soup Nazi level.  The Valley has more than enough fast-casual chain restaurants that feign homestyle cooking.  Come to Breadcrafters to enjoy an authentic bespoke dining experience."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time a few years ago because my mom used to work at the daycare next to the restaurant. For some reason I stopped coming but I recently came back and had the creamy wild rice and chicken soup along with a raspberry lemon bar and IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! Especially the lemon bar, it was soft and it wasn't too sour. I will definitely come back to eat here!!"}
{"text":"I am in the process of eating my way through the extensive menu of this bakery & cafe.  The baked goods are to die for & the sandwiches will not disappoint!  The catering menu for holiday meals and special occasions are a must try."}
{"text":"This was a very good sandwich from all the quality ingredients to the construction of the sandwich itself. I had seen this place driving through PV and it looks like a big place, but the patio is bigger than the inside actually, which is not a great thing in the summer. You just order at the counter and there isn't a bunch a room to wait for the to-go order, so you will be shuffling around avoiding people waiting for your order. My sandwich was served on Raisin Pecan cranberry bread I believe and it was a unique combo of cream cheese and cranberry sauce and high quality turkey and lettuce and tomato. You must try the potato salad as the side dish also. It was nearly a perfect sandwich and it was about 10 bucks. A winner and they also had some unique cookies to try next time (cornflake)."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  The baked goods looked so good.  The bread was so fresh and warm. Beautiful deserts that tempt to try a little of everything."}
{"text":"Stopped here before getting my nails done next door (Blooming Nails and Spa..very good btw) and it's a good spot to grab a quick bite. At first I wasn't sure about pre-made salads sitting in the display, especially since I love my salads very fresh, but my salad was actually great! I was impressed by how everything was fresh and made only a couple hours before being sealed, and it's what they do daily. Pictured are the Club sandwich and the Napa valley salad with chicken, grapes, pecans and honey lime dressing. They have many dressing options to choose from too. My only issue was that my coffee was (self serve) was only luke warm :/ but otherwise a great place and very friendly owners/staff."}
{"text":"What a cute little place!  My sandwich was good and some of the pastries in the display case looked mouth-watering.  They even had a high chair tucked away for my son to sit in.  The inside is quite small, with only a couple tables, but there is more seating outside."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Breadcrafters on Tatum in quite some time.  We arrived around 1 p.m.  by 1:30 p.m. the place filled up quickly.  

The boyfriend had the Park Avenue Chicken Salad  the most popular sandwich on the menu with white-meat Chicken Salad made with Grapes and Almonds & served on Raisin Walnut Pecan Hearth Loaf with
Lettuce & Tomato. $7.50 and I the Bourbon Street Ham with  Provolone, Mixed Olive Relish, Lettuce, Tomato & Vinaigrette on Ciabatta Loaf. $7.25  Delish.  Next time I would try a softer bread.  The Ciabiatta was a bit tough to chew.  To drink I ordered the Feeling Nutty Latte with a shot of hazelnut and walnut syrups.  Ben had the Passion Fruit iced tea.

Can't wait to try the breakfast menu.  The website iscurrently under construction."}
{"text":"Love this locally owned bakery! The owners are great especially Angela---always making me laugh! She'd tell you 'it's no fakery like the ones down the street!' Or 'Let's get rid of those green straws.' I love supporting local. The quality of the food is impeccable! I love the breakfasts--try the Benedict's best. You can have it as a sandwich or plated with bread on the side. For lunch I love the chicken salad plate or the park avenue sandwich. My fav salad is the BBQ chicken. Dressings are homemade and you can tell! And let's talk about their soup! The chicken tortilla is my fave on Wednesdays and Thursday's! Coffee is great! Ice tea is awesome! Angela calls the beverage side of the business 'BevCrafters.' Cute place, friendly staff---check it out!"}
{"text":"I've always driven by this place, but one day decided to stop in. This place is adorable, with cute desserts in the case, along with delicious looking salads. This definitely would be a great place to meet up with a girlfriend and have some desserts! They have outdoor seating, which is the majority of the seating provided, that is thankfully shaded. 

 Stop in for a bite for lunch, some dessert, or even some fresh bread!"}
{"text":"I once upon a time really enjoyed coming here, it's changed a lot since then...I was coming here once a week or more until the past few months. Every time I have been here recently they have been out of focaccia bread by noon-1pm. 

*update* Stopped in again today and what do you know, they are out of bread again. I can get processed deli meat on French bread anywhere, I only come here for the focaccia bread. Since that doesn't ever seem to be available I won't be returning anymore."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have amazing sandwiches! I always get the southwest chicken or the California chicken club! I have tried all of their sides and they are delicious! They have fresh bread and deserts and the ones I have tried are amazing! Everyone here is super nice! The salads are also to die for and super fresh!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've tried Breadcrafters Bakery & Cafe, and it has not disappointed.  I've fallen in love with the turkey and brie sandwich, and the chipotle chicken sandwich is amazing too.  Great atmosphere, cute decor, delicious food, and friendly staff.  I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Didn't stick around for the food. Way too cramped at lunchtime.  It was our first time and there was not enough sitting because it is a tiny place.  The menus are chalkboards that are difficult to read.  It was just to complicated for me so we left. So only two stars for atmosphere. Food may be good but the place never stood a chance with me.  So sorry!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed today when I ordered the Yucatan salad. I received a bland no flavor lime chicken, dressing was horrible too!. One of the  reasons why I ordered was that it said it would come with crunchy corn, which It didn't have at all! Instead without asking me they substituted with radish ! Agh! Not coming back is not worth the $10 I paid for that salad-! As a side note I was not the only one at my office that DIDN'T like her lunch today!  We miss McAllister's already !!! :("}
{"text":"Haven't had a sandwich this good since I made one myself, only I will admit this one was better than homemade!  I may have forgotten what extremely fresh bread tastes like, thank you for the reminder!  The ambiance is charming, the desserts begged for more attention, but I settled on the Turkey and Pepper-jack sandwich.  It was truly amazing!  My friends and family are very fortunate because my next event will be catered by them!  Fresh food, excellent presentation, knowledgeable, kind, and caring staff!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful spot. Shame on me for waiting so long to come in! I now know where to solve the \"what's for...\" question."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, my boyfriend and I came here randomly for lunch and we were REALLY hungry. The food took a little longer to come out than we would have hoped for, however....I completely understand why. The food was amazing! You can tell how much time and thought they put into each component to make it absolutely delicious. I had the California club and everything about it was wonderful. My boyfriend had the French Dip and the potato leek soup. Again, wonderful! I'm not sure if this is a locally owned spot or not, but we will be returning very often."}
{"text":"100+ 4 star reviews?  We must have had a REALLY off day.  Double meat please:  well we certainly didn't get more meat and what we got looked like it had been through a Star Trek transporter malfunction.  The bread was actually good.  The three slices of cheese that we got were good.  However, we packed up the meat and mixed it in with food for the Westies.  They loved it, BTW.  Why is it so difficult to get a good sandwich in Phoenix?"}
{"text":"I have been here about a half dozen times. 

The first time, I would have given it four or five stars. 

I had a veggie sandwich where I chose what went on it. It was very yummy. The only problem was that biting and chewing the sandwich was a bit tough as the crust on the (yummy) sourdough bread was tough, but it was worth it, cause it was good. 

However, two or three times I have ordered roasted red pepper (which costs extra) and received green pepper instead. I've usually been too hungry to bother asking for red pepper and just eaten the sandwich as is. 

I've gotten some sourdough bread to go before, makes for yummy sandwiches at home. 

The other negative is that one of the women who works there before has been a bit standoffish and not very helpful. In one instance, my grandma ordered coffee only to be told they were out of it, in a not so nice tone. 

Overall, their bread makes for yummy sandwiches, but starting to wonder if it is worth it to go out of my way for a sandwich and mediocre service."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd visit and we were able to final order. The previous 2 times they were out of stock on almost every item. The Berry salad was great. The grilled cheese was way to buttery and too much cheese. It was extremely expensive, $9 for bread and cheese.    We ordered the iced white chocolate mocha, it tasted like coffee and milk, not good; and a mocha frappe, it tasted like powdered iced. We were sick to our stomachs after drinking it. 
We have not tried the sandwiches, so this is a small scale review. I wouldn't go back. Too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a sandwich.
Fresh bread - kinda spendy."}
{"text":"Great, cozy feel inside. Amazing food (considering we are talking soups, salads, and sandwiches), and BAKED GOODS are food comas waiting to happen. Even their music selection is eclectic. Family run, it seems, and certainly somewhere I will come to again and again!"}
{"text":"Went to this adorable little cafe with my Grama and it was  delicious! Breakfast was so good we took home some bread. I definitely reccomend for brunch or just some baked goods."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Breadcrafters today Sunday at noon for the first time. We were unfamiliar with the menu and the lady behind the counter was so openly impatient with an obnoxious attitude, that my daughter who had been at this restaurant several times and recommended the place, finally  told her politely how rude she was to her parents. We walked out. They lost a regular customer two new customers plus a sale which was including several desert items for a party. Drove down the block to Whole Foods and had a great meal, plus did some shopping for the deserts."}
{"text":"We stopped in for an early lunch last weekend after our workout and fell in love with this place!  We split a turkey and brie sandwich with raspberry preserves on a croissant, each had the rice and albondigas soup and I splurged on a chocolate mousse...perfection!  Fresh ingredients, inventive menu and super friendly staff.

Of course I am a big fan of the dog friendly patio with views of the mountains as well."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and I will be coming back for sure! Fresh food, great portion size, and great place! The owner is super nice and greets everyone with such warmth. I had the southwest chicken sandwich and it was probably the tastiest chicken sandwich I have had in a long time! Amazing treats, you must try the lemon raspberry bar! Reasonable prices too! Don't waste your money on Panera or kneaders garbage. Come to this place! You'll be beyond impressed like me!"}
{"text":"This place is tiny but oh so good.  I love places that have free samples out for you to try when you walk in.  They've got a great selection of healthy options for a lunch that won't leave you feeling all gross for the rest of your work day.  The owner was very friendly with all of us and our food was ready in record time.  I had the #3 sandwich which had turkey, pepper jack, avocado, green pepper, and red onion on wheat bread.  An excellent combination.

My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach, so next time I'll be sure to take advantage of the half sandwich option.  They also have daily soup, sandwich, and salad specials and you can pick two of those for $6.50.  My only suggestion for Breadcrafters is to switch from styrofoam to paper cups."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch a few days ago.  I guess we got here before the lunch rush because it was dead when we got there but the small place started to fill up pretty fast.  There are under 10 small tables in the place so if you are dining in get here as early as you can.

I know they can't help it but the place is pretty small, hot and cramped when it gets crowded.  I also don't like it that you have to ask for a soda refill and can't just get it yourself.  I do understand though that space is an issue here and it isn't a full service restaurant so it is what it is.  All the workers are very very friendly and helpful however.

For my sandwich I chose the Turkey Jack Stack.  I loved the sourdough bread but the actual sandwich was just standard.  It was of a decent size and had plenty of fresh ingredients, but the flavor was just eh.  Not really worth $7.50.

The cole slaw is pretty good as it was not overly creamy.  It was perfect for a hot summer day and was quite refreshing...or as refreshing as cole slaw can be.  

The cookies are also very good and fresh.  There is an awesome chocolate one where they put in crasins which is a welcome touch and adds a sweet-tartness to the cookie.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I just love it so much! I can't believe I've never 'yelped' it before. I love the salads, and my favorite is the one with spicy chicken, avocado, hard boiled egg, and spicy ranch. There is so much more on that southwest salad, and trust me, you'll like it. I love the chicken salad on raisin walnut bread. I almost always order that with a side of delicious potato salad. I can't ever resist the pumpkin golden raisin cookie. Lovelovelove!"}
{"text":"We recently had Breadcrafters cater our Holiday party. We ordered an assortment of sandwich trays, potato salad, fruit salad, and Homemade cookies. All of our guests raved on how fresh all the food was and the spread was absolutely delicious. To top things off During the ordering process Angela made each step so easy and treated us like great friends. I give Breadcrafters 5 stars and recommend them to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"So, here's the thing. I've been going to this place for years. And, although their bread and treats are good, they lack the most important thing...CUSTOMER SERVICE. The last 3 times I've gone in, they've gotten my order wrong. Sadly, they don't seem to care either. On their website, they say \"We are faithfully committed to the happiness of our customers, leaving them delightfully satisfied with a compelling feeling to share their experience with friends and family.\" Funny. 

If you go, don't expect any customer service, and especially and most importantly, don't expect to get what you actually ordered."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating. The staff is very nice and welcoming. Though they may be in the middle of making something for another person, they are good about acknowledging you are here.

The pastries are excellent, and they are huge. You definitely get your money's worth. I had the turkey and avocado sandwich which was very good. They serve breakfast, soups, salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food and scones are a 4.5...the service on the weekends generally sucks.  Ive had below average service on the weekends previously, but this weekend was too much.  I went yesterday to pick up a couple coffees and scones and we waited at the counter for 5 minutes before anyone came to the front.  People in the back making food could see us and even made eye contact.  I can't figure out why nobody was up front or was told we were waiting. When someone finally came up we told them we were about to leave and they didn't seem to care.  I decided to try again today... Same thing.  Exact same experience except this time I walked out after 4 minutes, and there was food in the window that I assume was ready for the couple that was in there.  I can't imagine going back after this weekend."}
{"text":"The food is good, however some of the people that run the place seem a little grumpy. Makes you wonder if that $11.00 salad was really worth it"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had the SW chicken sandwich. It was ok. I wish I had gone with something else because other plates I saw looked really good.  The cookies looked pretty good so I had to partake. I had a chocolate chip cookie called sweet dream. The cookie was amazing!  I would give this place 5 stars for the cookie. It was soft, gooey and had a hint of ginger - delish!  I'd go back, try something else and definitely have another cookie."}
{"text":"In a rush to get a quick lunch while in the area we opted to go here over the Paradise Bakery down the street.   While the food was ok and i'm all for supporting a small locally owned business we walked away a little disappointed. 

They focus on all types of breads including a variety of loaves, rolls, and some baked goods.  The also offer the usual lunch options of sandwiches, soups, and salads (premade).  Tried 1/2 chicken salad sandwich on some sort of raisin bread and a chicken noodle salad and 1 drink.  Both were not bad but also not memorable or unique in any way.  Service was  so-so as you got the impression that they were just focused on finishing up lunch service so they could close shop.  In their haste to get orders out they rang up ours wrong and forgot the roll and dressing. 

Overall seemed kinda pricey at $18 considering what we ordered and the competition. And unless the weather is nice enough to sit outside there is only seating for 8 or so. Nothing really unique about this place and can neither endorse nor oppose going to this place.  Give me a few days and i will probably forget about this place."}
{"text":"Small cute little cafe with great sandwiches . It's a little pricey but the food is usually fresh and really tasty. However their customer service leaves a lot to be desired"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch after driving through the area and we are both happy we did. I had the vegetable beef soup and a passion green tea. He had a build-your-own turkey sandwich. The bread was amazing and soft. My soup was well seasoned and generously filled with beef and veggies. It was so good, I found myself thinking about it hours later.

When we walked in, we were greeted and thanked for supporting a local eatery. It's a smaller sized location, but there seemed to be plenty of seating inside and out. 

We chose to sit outside where there were a few other patrons. As soon as we finished our meals, someone came out to take our trays for us.

Service was great. Food was great. Pricing was great for the quality of ingredients being used.

I really hope we get to visit again before returning to Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing breakfast burritos. Recommend the Sante Fe burrito.. Also ordered their bread pudding for christmas last year.. Was a major hit."}
{"text":"This place seems great for fresh baked goods and healthy eating options. It's a bit cramped inside so quick order and go may be best.

There are plenty of hot and cold  sandwich options available. Prices are on the higher end. I love how there was ready-made salads and refrigerated options if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Unhappy customer here! I ordered orange scones (apparently they don't do plain scones???) for a tea party for my husband's niece. I  called in the order in about a week before the party. 

Picked the order up on the day of party, only to find out that they had made cranberry scones.  I hate cranberries. I pointed this out, and their response was they could make some, but they would not be ready until the next day. Not helpful since the party was that day. 

Come on guys. Not only that, but they weren't really scones. Scones are a little on the hard side hence the need for cream and strawberries. These were more like big flat muffin tops. Big fat cranberry muffin tops."}
{"text":"Went to Breadcrafters with my sister and we both got sandwiches and a fruit tart to share. We both enjoyed our food a lot but it was the bread that made the food. I loved the fruit tart. I wish I could have tried all of their sweet treats. But good place to eat but my only complaint was that it was so small. Like only 7 tables... Oh well amazing food!"}
{"text":"Cute and quaint  with a nice little patio. Seems like the perfect place to meet for a quick breakfast or lunch.  Last Sunday I ended up there when looking for a breakfast for my daughter, Sammy. See all my talk about junk food has come to fruition and she won't grab a quick bite at Mc D's or Burger King...which is exactly what I want, for her to be discerning ... but  you get the idea. Now I have to find better more expensive choices/healthier foods , oh well she is worth it. 
This little bakery has a tidy selection of  muffins and scones fresh and the place smelled nice.  Daughter had a Morning Muffin , which I would call a Morning Glory Muffin , it had a spicier taste but not nutmeg or cinnamon , Sammy wasn't thrilled . I thought it smelled good. I had a berry scone which tasted really good.  I would go back for one if I was in the neighborhood.  
One down side was the counter service, the gal was doing her best , but one person taking orders getting drinks, bakery goods, and refilling teas and coffee seemed a bit much . While there we saw a constant line of  people and the poor girl couldn't get caught up , she would have to stop and refill tea machines  and that meant people waiting.  I felt bad for her. 
One side note they had a nice selection of pre-made  food  like fresh cut up fruit , veggies and chicken breast that looked good for fast eating on the run."}
{"text":"An small interesting place to try. I liked the French toast. We did not like the chia tea."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new for lunch and saw on my Yelp mobile app that this place had pretty decent ratings.  It's not a big place, but you can sit inside for lunch if you want to.  I didn't really know what I wanted to try, so I went with what looked someone familiar to me.  They had an arugula salad that was pretty similar to the Cowboy Ciao Stetson salad.  Perhaps that just wasn't the best choice.  The stetson salad is my favorite salad, so I think my expectations were too high.  It just didn't compare.  It was also kind of expense for the size of the salad.  I'm not sure I would try then again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an iced tea and ended up buying a chocolate croissant and a loaf of bread! The croissant was delicious. The tea was fresh and not bitter. Their menu looked great. I'll definitely be back for food sometime soon."}
{"text":"It has a lot of the elements that you look for in a great neighborhood bakery.  What keeps it from joining the Varsity lunch list? The space is awkwardly cramped.  The lackluster soups detract from otherwise solid sandwiches."}
{"text":"You threw my sandwich away... my sandwich.... MY SANDWICH! 

My friends always tease me when we are searching for a good sandwich shop.  I have been told on more then one occassion that I can be little \"Ross\" or \"Joey\"  like from the show  \"Friends\" when it comes to my sandwiches. 

Today, we went to Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe for lunch, and it was absolutely delicious. I've had many sandwiches from all over the valley and the folks at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe are doing up sandwiches right. Lookout,  AJ's Whole Foods, Jimmy Johns, Quiznos, Capriottis, and all the others; Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe is here.

Breadcrafters offers great lunch specials.  You can get a sandwich and your choice of potato salad, pasta salad, fruit salad,  or chips.  Today, my lunch companion and I had the tuna salad on sourdough and the Focaccia Deluxe  (turkey,ham, salami, provolone, lettuce, tomatoes, Parmesan pesto, on Italian herb bread) with a side of potato salad and fruit salad.  I have to admit the Parmesean Pesto spread  was fantastic and the potato salad is the best I ever had. 

All the breads at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe are made fresh daily.  The Walnut Pecan Raisin, Swiss & Black Pepper, look delicious.  I can't wait to try them all on my next visit.

If your in the area give Breadcrafters a try.  Expect great sandwiches, salads, soups, desserts, and the best customer service."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop around!! Amazing breads, fresh everything.I cannot eat a sandwich anywhere else without a little disappointment because they just don't compare."}
{"text":"Super friendly, local, homemade food. Love the vibe here. Awesome selection and high quality food."}
{"text":"Food is great, but customer service is horrible. I tried to order a salad today at around 5:15pm. Once they sell out of its gone for the day. The guy taking my order was extremely rude and nasty telling me I should have ordered it earlier then to get it. That is just uncalled for to have such an attitude. Customer service could be so much better."}
{"text":"Fast became a new favorite. I'm not a huge fan of salads as frequently presented in most establishments.
Bread crafters has the perfect portions of salads. Not too heavy on the greens, refreshing combos of protein and produce.

My favorite salad hands down is the chicken salad stuffed avocado with sliced strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and kiwi. I get champagne vinaigrette on the side, house made. 

I've had a hot soup, sorry to say I can't remember which one but I liked it, the choices appear to rotate.

Infusion iced tea offered, locally owned in Tempe.

I'm not a huge bread/rolls person but their sourdough and raisin walnut is worth the carb splurge imo. 

Lots of tempting baked goods as well. I can't vouch for taste but I am going to indulge one of these days! Classics like cookies or fruit tart, and creative offerings like House made kit Kat bars and HUGE fun covered strawberries( go find out for yourself)

Icing on the cake is great friendly warm service with a smile each time. I've been in 4 or 5 times in the past 2 weeks. Speed of service is also fantastic considering the quality. 

I love stopping in for lunch whenever I'm in the area.
Catering available as well."}
{"text":"Super friendly and delicious little gem of a place! The hot southwest chicken sandwich is so good, I would definitely get it again. The patio is adorable and shaded. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a little pricey for the size of what you get. Two sandwiches and two sodas was $27. I came here with my friend and we are two average female eaters and had no problem finishing the sandwhich...it's definitely not a split or have leftovers kind of situation."}
{"text":"There's an unexplainable culinary phenomenon that's probably happened to each and every one of us, a sandwich for whatever reason always tastes better when someone else makes it. I'm not sure how or why this happens. If you ask around many have already formulated a various theories. Some feel it's the way the condiments are layered amongst the slices of meat and cheese. Others think that it's a secret ingredient that maker uses like a dash of celery salt or paprika. My mom used to make me a sandwich of sliced turkey, Muenster cheese, Miracle Whip, bread and butter pickles on Wonder bread. I've made this sandwich so many times but have never been able to make it taste as good as hers. 

I recently tested this out at Breadcrafters Bakery and Cafe in Paradise Valley where they specialize in fresh bakes breads, house made salads and of course sandwiches made by someone else. Breadcrafters isn't your ordinary sandwich shop, as the name indicates they also bake bread and pastries, but oh the bread! For me this is one of the best bread bakeries in a town that only has a handful of really good bread makers. 

To celebrate such amazing bread, why not make amazing sandwiches? 

Nancy's Favorite ($7.75) arrived piled high with roast beef, Gorgonzola and roasted onion spread, roasted red peppers, lettuce and tomato on a crusty baguette. Aside form the chewy flavorful baguette and the tender roast beef, the bold and creamy notes of the cheese spread makes this sandwich a stack-of-love. By contrast the Turkey Jack Stack ($7.75) had a spicy bite thanks to pepper jack cheese and red onion. The sourdough bread it was served on was so spongy and flavorful I ordered a loaf ($4.50) to go. 

Unfortunately the Park Avenue Chicken Salad ($7.75) was under-seasoned; its only saving grace was the incredible raisin walnut pecan bread it was served on. On my next visit, Ill just pick up a loaf ($4.50) of the bread and skip the salad. 

When you order a sandwich you have your choice of potato salad, pasta salad, fruit, coleslaw or potato chips. I might avoid the disappointing potato salad. The potatoes were oven roasted which is great but the spuds were over cooked and dehydrated making for a chewy strange tasting mess. 

The love doesn't stop at their bread; they make cupcakes that are moist and inviting. On my last visit I picked up a Red Velvet Cupcake ($2.75) and a Strawberry Shortcake Cupcake ($2.75).  On my way back home I couldn't stop thinking about the cute little white box housing my treats. Once home, dessert came first! The shortcake cupcake wasn't shortcake at all but made from angel food cake, then topped with real whipped cream and a glazed strawberry. This was one of those desserts you savor and enjoy though I ended up eating the whole thing in about four bites, yes it was that good. Wiping the crumbs from my face I proceeded to convince myself that I would only have a single bite of the red velvet, wrong. I couldn't resist licking the cream cheese frosting off before devouring the moist and ultra chewy cake. 

While there is still no concrete reason why a sandwich made by someone else's hand is better, I do know this, I enjoyed trying to prove this one out."}
{"text":"LOVED, LOVED, LOVED Breadcrafters! We recently moved into the area and have been trying some local places by our house and while out shopping last weekend we decided to stop into Breadcrafters for lunch. I am soooo glad we did. I had the Southwest Chicken and it was amazing!!!! I'm super picky about chicken and it was juicy, and the flavors of the entire sandwich was just spot on. My boyfriend had the Twisted Turkey and he really, really liked his as well. This place is super cute and had such a cozy feel to it. I am not a huge sandwich person but found myself thinking about this sandwich again! Service was great and I think on our next visit I will have to try a yummy dessert or something."}
{"text":"Meh, it's okay.

Very tiny and not a whole lot of options make a new customer wander toward the smell of the oh so good In-n-Out in the parking lot.

The bread was good, I had the Chibatta (spell check?) but the meat was very slimy and reminded me of a poor gas station sandwich. 


Maybe it was just my experience but I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem! Fresh bakery goods, great coffee, and the owner Angela clearly has a lot of pride in the place. They seem to have really nice salads and lunch options too"}
{"text":"Everything happens for a reason! Friend of mine made a spontaneous choice of trying a new place for lunch. Couldn't be happier with the delicious outcome.  Quality of dining was well spent! Absolutely loved the black cherry Italian soda; delightful indulgence!  Returning soon to grab another lemon pepper chicken salad  ~blown away with the exceptional customer service provided from the moment we stepped foot in the door."}
{"text":"Great place for quick, convenient, and QUALITY food. Stopped in for lunch one day and was impressed with the sandwiches and salads. The staff is very helpful and accommodating!"}
{"text":"I love salads from this place!!! They have so many varieties to choose from. My favorite is the mango avocado. Also their soups is very tasty and made from scratch!!! Breads are freshly made as well. The place is always clean inside and out. Cute setup for both indoors and outdoors. The lady at the register is super nice. Always happy to greet me and help me pick out what kind of salad I want. She's very helpful with suggestions when I'm indecisive. I've been here multiple times now and had a great experience each and every time!!! Prices are a little pricey, but the quality of the food and the service that they give is well worth it."}
{"text":"First time here, and I tried the spicy Santa Fe breakfast burrito. The place is clean and they've made it almost possible to forget it's in a strip mall, which is great. Service was friendly and quick. The food was fresh and very good. I was a bit surprised to have to pay over $10 for a breakfast burrito, but it was one of the better ones I've had, with interesting touches like fresh spinach, homemade chorizo, sautéed mushrooms and quality bacon. Plus it was huge. Could easily split it with someone, which would make the price totally justifiable. 
WiFi was abysmal - I usually rely on a quick wifi jolt when I'm looking for stops like this during my workday so to me that's significant, but for most people that's a non-issue. 
Lunch menu looks very promising with lots of interesting combinations."}
{"text":"Went in at 4:30pm on Saturday when they closed at 5pm to get 2 sandwiches. The guy in there huffed and puffed from the moment I walked in as if I was bothering him. When I asked for a chicken sandwich he said they were out of chicken. When I asked him to give me a minute to check with what my wife wanted he persisted to pace back and forth huffing and puffing. I felt like if I had stayed he would have spit in my food so I left. Very disrespectful experience compared to the last time I was there."}
{"text":"Stop by this AM for coffee and sandwich. The food is little better but still need help on the presentation side and when you state on the menu \"egg your way\" I should be able to order it my way. After it cost $ 9.00 for sandwich which is high.

Service could of been better and prices lower. Save yourself the money and go across the street and save $ 4.00 on the same items."}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday with my daughter. Nice inside. Sandwich with chicken and nuts. No taste. Bread was not from the day. Too thick. No side coleslaw or potato salad. Side of pasta, directly on a sheet of paper on a top of fake wood tray. Nothing special for a $10 sandwich. Another replica of replica of replica of sandwich shop."}
{"text":"I am always in the mood for a good Deli Sandwich and I was randomly driving by Breadcrafter's while looking for a place to have a late lunch. In an environment surrounded by large chain restaurants with your standard unhealthy boring food Breadcrafters was a real discovery. It has a prime location and everything is made fresh in house. Not only do they have great lunches but they have amazing breakfasts and you can buy their bake goods for your own personal use as well. It was a little on the pricey side, $25 for two people for lunch, but then again healthy and home made always is. They are also pet friendly with treats and water so bring your dog and relax out on the covered patio with misters. I highly recommend Breadcrafters Bakery & Cafe for anyone looking to break away from the representativeness that is chain restaurant dining."}
{"text":"This is a nice Mom & Pop type joint with a unique menu. The breakfast burros and roast beef sandwiches are terrific. We get the fresh bread loads from here too."}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted something non-chain and not a sit down restaurant. Bread crafters is tiny (doesn't even have a public restroom) but very cutely decorated. The guy behind the counter was very helpful on my first visit and even had a chance to sample the soup of the day. The lunch special was good and I liked the soup bowls. I didn't try a pastry but noticed lots of goodies. I'm glad I stopped here!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich, croissant was delicious. I went after 1pm and many things had already sold out."}
{"text":"Good food. Would give 5 stars but their prices are a bit expensive and sometimes the service is slow during the lunch rush. 

Try the stuffed avocado chicken salad with balsamic dressing. Or the chicken salad sandwich. Tasty..."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite sandwich place!

I've probably driven by Breadcrafters over 3.000 times since I moved to Phoenix.  It's in an unassuming little shopping center on Tatum across the street from PV Mall.  I noticed the sign but never thought twice about going in until my friend Deborah recently told me that they have wonderful sandwiches and salads that are perfect for picking up when you're on the run.

So, instead of trusting Deborah 100% (I don't know her THAT well yet), I sent my mom in to try Breadcrafters when she asked me where she should go for lunch during her last visit.  It passed the 'mom test' with flying colors... my mom loved it - she said it was perfect!

Today was my turn... and needless to say, I was extremely impressed!  The staff was really sincere, friendly and helpful.  When I walked in, I smelled fresh bread and I saw several cases full of not only bread, but sandwiches, salads, and baked goods too!  Everything looked awesome!  I looked at the menu and noticed that prices were reasonable and they offered daily specials including soup/sandwich combo and 'the daily double' where you pick two different items to make your own combo.  It took me a few minutes. but I decided to design my own sandwich off the menu... I went with turkey, lettuce, tomato. avocado., sprouts, and spicy mustard on multi-grain alsatian bread.  It came with my choice of sides (I went with coleslaw) and a pickle.

If you've read my reviews, you know I don't usually go into detail about the food more than saying what I ordered, liked, didn't like. etc... however, I have to make an exception on this one.  The sandwich may sound like any other sandwich you could pick up anywhere, but this sandwich was special!  Every bite I took, I tasted all of the ingredients.  It was balanced perfectly!  Just the right amount of mustard and avocado spread evenly on the bread, fresh and juicy turkey. crisp lettuce, and ripe tomato.  Yum!

I was there after 2 for a late lunch expecting this random place to be empty... but I was wrong.  The place was hopping!  I noticed that people were eating outside (it was a beautiful day) and that Breadcrafters is DOG FRIENDLY!  I also noticed that many people came in just to buy freshly-baked bread.  Not a bad idea - I'll have to remember that for next time we're entertaining!

I overheard Angela. the (new) owner, tell a customer that the bread sold like crazy today, so I imagine the best selection is first thing in the morning... It may have been my first visit to Breadcrafters but it will not be my last.  See you there!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is top notch!  \"Nancy's favorite sandwich\" is also Suzanne's :).  I think the drinks are a little overpriced and the service at times isn't the fastest...but if your looking for a great baked goods with quality ingredients stop at this place."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Service was amazing! People are so so nice ! It's pretty spendy tho. We had two sandwiches and 2 desserts as 2 drinks and it was $45!
That's dinner prices!  The desserts were not necessary and prob added $7 or so. Also not worth what they charge. They were ok. Not great. They look amazing and so tempting but do our wallet and your waistline a favor and skip it."}
{"text":"Love this cafe! Such yummy breakfast foods and I always indulge in their yummy dessert items! It is super clothes to the mall and easy access! I also have ha lunch here a couple times with my boyfriend and it was so yummy and portions are a great size! Overall a very delicious bakery!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and I really like this place! One of the owners was working and she was hilarious. They make everything fresh there...lots of baked goods, bread, great vegetarian options for lunch too! I was only planning on ordering coffee but couldn't pass up the chance for a fresh baked croissant and chocolate chip cookie. Good thing because they were delicious! I will definitely be back soon....next time with an appetite!"}
{"text":"Will return for fresh baked bread chicken sandwich with fresh roasted chilies. French toast is perfect."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim the other day because we wanted a really good sandwich place  to go and found this on yelp. On the outside, the restaurant looks bigger than when you go in. The restaurant is a small, cozy cafe. I wouldn't say the place is good for groups and strollers as it had a few tables and chairs. They seemed to have a nice more spacious patio outside though.

I ordered a cold tuna sandwich and it was a delight to eat! Loved every bite. I also ordered their green tea which I enjoyed as well. I hear they serve breakfast and coffee so I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Disappointed after reading pretty decent reviews on this place. Went today around 2:15....it was pretty dead, I was the only customer in there. Ordered two sandwiches, two bags of chips and a cup of soup to go. Not cheap, about $27. The guy that helped me was not friendly at all. While he was ringing me up, another guy tells him that someone in the back \"isn't usually like that\" and that she was in a bad mood because someone else didn't show up for work. My cashier responds to him with \"I don't care, it's not my job to do that\"....obviously there had been an issue between coworkers before I walked in, but to have the conversation while I'm trying to order makes things awkward. My food was ready about 10 mins later and I was just glad to get out of there. We got a club and a southwest chicken sandwich. The club literally had one slice of turkey, one slice of ham and some bacon. Not worth $9. The southwest chicken sandwich had greasy soggy bread and dry chicken...and a bonus eyelash. The potato leek soup was actually pretty good, but the croutons that came with it were burnt and the slice of bread we were given with it was dry and had a dead gnat on it. I was excited to try this place, but definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"oh  how i love breadcrafters. seriously, i LOVE it. amazing bread, soups, sandwiches, pastries. the place is cozy with only 5 or 6 tables inside, but it makes sense because they have tons and tons of fresh breads to sell and they need the room. i order the 1/2 sandwich and salad special on mondays - turkey parm pesto with a small chef salad. i eat the sandwich on monday and the salad tuesday or wednesday - both is way too much for lunch for me. the turkey is never too salty and the veggies are always perfectly ripe and fresh. you'd have to pay me not to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent quality food and an extensive menu selection.  They also have a top  notch catering menu and fresh desserts.  Everything is hand made and fabulous."}
{"text":"Holy monster scones!

Went here to pick up a pastry, ended up biting off more than I bargained for.  My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach.  I ordered a bacon and egg croissant with pepper jack cheese.  

While I waited for my breakfast sandie, I drooled over the massive, football-sized chocolate croissant, baseball-sized scones and cookies bigger than my palm.  Then I saw it waiting for me: a beautiful red head.  She looked so sweet and rich and I couldn't deny my cravings.  I just had to buy a red velvet cupcake.  And she turned out to be everything I could ever want.

Oh, and the croissant sandwich was pretty good, too."}
{"text":"No, we just stopped serving breakfast.
The only vegetarian lunch item is the cold veggie sandwich.
We're out of wheat bread.
I *guess* we could toast the bread.
All delivered in a forced-friendly-but-really-irritated manner by an extremely bored woman.
OK, at $18 for lunch for two (1 full sandwich of the day, 1/2 veggie sandwich, two pops) I would hope that you are fully stocked, friendly, accommodating and apologetic, and don't intentionally assault my eardrums with shitty country music while I have to wait forever for very simple food. 
The food was OK, but our conclusion was that something like Subway would have been faster, better, and less snotty at half the price."}
{"text":"First time we went, we loved our breakfast sandwiches.  We couldn't wait to go back. Just went today. Not super busy when we got there. It's a beautiful Sunday morning. Walk in. They are out of breakfast menus and the kid behind the counter said he doesn't know the menu and can't help until the owner gets back from printing the menu. They are also out of coffee but he assured us he's making some. He over charges us for our meal and then helps the other customers before refunding us.  Now the coffee is ready and  it comes out a light shade of pale. Send that back. Waiting entirely too long now for our food and was told everything is made to order. Well it's bacon and eggs so I would hope so.  Asked for a refund. Owner passive aggressively tells us to have a blessed and wonderful day and we left.  Great concept. Bread is amazing but they really need to get their act together   Won't be back on a Sunday again that's for sure."}
{"text":"I just tried the soup and salad combo - the chicken pesto past soup is so good! The price is fair and the environment is nice, clean and cozy. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I think this place is probably pretty good on a normal day, but I guess we came on the wrong day.... The kid (one of the two young guys that was working at the time) that took our order kept getting SO confused and kept asking us repeatedly what we were getting or trying to talk to us about a different sandwich when we had already told him what we wanted. So ordering was like pulling teeth. The same kid went to the back to make our sandwiches and we went to sit outside because the guy said he would bring them to us, but then we noticed the person who ordered after us got their sandwich and left already so we went inside to check on it.... and let's just say the sandwiches looked less than appetizing and I have no idea why it took the so long to make the HOT sandwich  because the cheese wasn't even melted! He also used the wrong bread for each of our sandwiches, forgot the spread that was supposed to be on it, and forgot the veggies. It really just looked like WAY too much meat on bread. Anyway, we brought the sandwiches back in to the other guy that was working and he said he'd remake them. They came back out looking beautiful, but due to the time that was wasted ordering, waiting, and waiting again we had no time to do the things we needed to do in Phoenix before we had to drive back to Flagstaff. That being said, I would still try this place again (which is why I gave it 3 stars) because the person who told us about it said it was owned by two ladies who make everything from scratch and I think they have a great little place, but that guy should not be making them! Hopefully next time the owners will be there. I feel horrible saying that because he was super friendly and nice, but he couldn't stay focused and didn't prepare the food the way it was supposed to be or in a presentable way. Oh, one last thing: there was way too much meat on the sandwiches. Maybe it's just me, but I would've been happy with thinner slices of chicken (we got the Santa Fe chicken and the chicken cordon bleu). Also, the Gorgonzola spread was SO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Breadcrafters for a quick lunch on a Saturday. They were moderately busy but not packed. Looking at the prices I assumed the sandwiches would be quite large and I was right. My boyfriend and I split one and for a light lunch the size was just right. 

We split the club with a side of pasta salad. The bread was fresh and soft and the ingredients were plentiful and fresh tasting as well. While the sandwich was big, the side was not - even for a single serving. I felt like they kinda skimped a little on the pasta. But what was there had a good flavor - a pesto sauce of some kind I think - with olives, red peppers and mushrooms. 

We sat outside, the patio was nice and relaxing.

Overall I'd say it was good but I wasn't blown away. I'd like to go back and try a different sandwich and side to see how it compares."}
{"text":"This was one of the best sandwiches I have had in a long time! I had the club sandwich, which has an amazing homemade thousand island dressing on the sandwich. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a casual lunch or for a to go order. Their baked goods also looked really good!"}
{"text":"I found this gem on Yelp a while back and bookmarked it. When I finally found the time to visit for lunch, it was only for takeout. I called in my order based on the items from their website. After viewing their website a few times, I thought they were part of a chain similar to Paradise Bakery. When I arrived to pick up my order, I was in complete shock as they are not a chain. According to the woman I spoke to, they have been around over 10 years. (And I just now noticed?!) My order consisted of a French dip for my husband and a roast beef melt for me. Their dessert case looked delicious, so I added a chocolate brownie for good measure. The woman behind the counter, who took my phone order, was both helpful and nice. I thought perhaps she was the owner or had been working for the company a long time as she seemed to know a lot.

Once back in the office, I dug into my sandwich. I really liked mine. The roast beef was delicious and I really liked the bread but the overall flavors of caramelized onions, mushrooms and mustard really blended well together. My husband liked my sandwich more than his French dip. I admit the French dip was a little disappointing. It was just bread, meat, and a small container for dipping sauce. It was a lot of bread and meat and no cheese. We've definitely had better French dips. However, the brownie... oh, it was amazing. It was super soft and fudgy with a dark chocolate frosting on top. Super decadent and would love to eat another or ten. 

If in the area, I would definitely go back and try more of their sandwiches and desserts."}
{"text":"Independently owned bakery and cafe. Strange mix of knick knacks for sale in addition to the food. Bread was excellent and my breakfast sandwich was the bomb!  Egg, bacon, Muenster cheese and avocado on perfectly grilled ciabatta bread. I am a glutton for gluten and this bread was amazing!  Service a bit scattered but they seemed to still be in learning mode.  Outdoor patio seating was very nice!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! A new favorite for me. The fall salad is to die for! Love the bakery selection and cozy atmosphere. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great little local place by my house, dog friendly patio which is a plus! I ordered the #9 focaccia deluxe with the pesto soup. Everything was delicious, I also recommend the salads. Only down side is if you don't get there early the choices get slimmer, especially on weekends. Everything sells out quick. I plan to go back and try some pastries soon."}
{"text":"Went to Breadcrafters on 10/17/17 with a group.  This was my first time and I probably won't be back.  While waiting in line to place my order I had a good view of the kitchen and it was a mess.  Bags of flour laying all over the floor, kitchen help was not wearing gloves and the counter staff while great looked very frazzled.

I had the Yucatan salad which listed lime chicken (it was just dry 1/8 inch sliced deli chicken, no taste) and corn.  There was not corn in the salad.  It was premade and cost $10.  Too much for the small salad with just 2 slices of check, a few pieces of sliced radish, 2 pieces of mandarin orange and the rest was lettuce.

Not my kind of place."}
{"text":"A great place for a casual breakfast or lunch. I love coming to Breadcrafters when I'm in the area. It's different than your run of the mill sandwich shop and I'm in love with the Turkey Jack Stack. They also have a great chicken and avocado salad when I'm trying to be a little healthier. The space is a little small on the inside, but they have a large outdoor dining space for those cooler fall days and if you're willing in the summer, the misters are always on. I still have yet to actually try the bread, which they make fresh daily, but it always looks and smells delicious."}
{"text":"Better luck next time.

We arrived 5 minutes before they were closing for some sweet treats to take over to a friends house.  I was trying to take it all in and figure out what to bring.  They were basically trying to close down while we were in there and I definitely got the impression that they wanted us out.  We picked out a pumpkin cookie, chocolate cake slice, a raspberry lemon bar and my guy got a salad.  It was all pretty decent, but nothing really fantastic.  The lemon bar was probably the standout.  The girl said the dressing was homemade bleu cheese, but it looked more like Italian.

If I'm in the area I will try this place again (hopefully earlier than 5 minutes before close) and try some of their bread and/or sandwiches.  It is called Breadcrafters after all..."}
{"text":"Don't be alarmed by the menu as it can be intimidating but their food is delicious! It was my first time visiting and wanted to try everything on the menu. A frequent customer suggested the Ham déjavu Sandwich and its exactly what I had. It was scrumptious! I did not wait long for the food to come out, everything was fresh and the customer service was excellent. Don't forget to try one of their delicious sweets; I had the Raspberry Lemon Square - YUM!"}
{"text":"One of the best Sour Cream Blueberry Muffins around. Unassuming little place across from the mall with really good sandwiches and breakfast items. Not for the high maint. types, it's just short of self serve, but fresh and good."}
{"text":"Cool bakery, great atmosphere, delicious food. But bad service - the woman behind the counter has such attitude. Strange for a small bakery; you would think they would be so nice and friendly but nope.  All that being said, the sandwiches are fantastic. I especially love the tuna melt here."}
{"text":"Place is nice and people are very friendly. That being said I have ordered breakfast from them to pickup three times now and have yet to get what I have asked for. They seem to always add extra things that I didn't ask for even being very specific. The burritos are decent, often soggy and undercooked and for 10$+ for a relatively small burrito I will be finding another breakfast spot. Lunch seems to be much better here...."}
{"text":"And went in to get a loaf of raisin walnut bread that was on display on the shelf. I waited 15 minutes to get to the front of the line to be told that loaf is not for sale really fucking annoyedand I'm never going back here"}
{"text":"I have loved Breadcrafters and appreciate independent business and hard working owners.   I always tip 20%+, even for takeout. 

Unfortunately Sun morning I ordered two breakfast burritos to-go.  I then waited patiently for 30 mins with other customers getting their dine-in plates who came in well after I placed my order.   I eventually inquired if there was a problem with my order.   The guy gave me attitude with rolling eyes and all....\"We're trying (blah blah)\".    When I looked back into the kitchen there were children apparently from the staff, hanging out at the food prep table and there was no sense of urgency back there that I could tell.   I'd still NOT be writing this review if when I got home, the two burritos unwrapped and stuck to the foil making a mess I wouldn't feed anyone.  I almost drove back, but I already lost so much time and a peaceful Sunday morning that I could not imagine any sort of productive encounter."}
{"text":"Yoooooooooo. If it weren't for my diminishing-everyday-metabolism (Fat.), I'd eat delicious sandwiches every day. They are my favorite food group. Breadcrafters builds a mean one!

This area is like a vortex of chainsuck, but we were nearby returning something at Best Buy and popped in to get dinner to go. The super-nice guy at the counter told us to take our time perusing the menu. I go the Turkey Jack Stack (turkey, pepper jack, veggies, avo), and my husband got the Focaccia Deluxe (combo of Italian meats, veggies, parmesan pesto). 

The food was FRESHHHHHHHHH. The combo of my sandwich ingredients was perfect, and my little fruit cup side (watermelon/cantaloupe/pineapple) was the perfect addition. The rosemary focaccia on my husband's sandwich was TO DIE, and he loved that his side of potato salad had bacon. (So, vegetarians beware!) Both came with a pickle spear, packed in their own individual ziplock baggie!

We got a lemon-raspberry bar for dessert, because DUH. It was amazing. A lot of their pastries were sold out (we came about an hour before their 7:00 p.m. close time), so they're obviously popular.

Breadcrafters is quick, fast and delicious! I'm pretty sure we'll always take it to-go, as the inside space was a little cramped and we're nearing 100 degree temps, rendering the (cute) little patio useless. But I'm so happy we stopped here!"}
{"text":"Went here today - very very small place - they are not able to handle a crowd, so go during slow times.  Seats are outside, with only 6 seats inside and very very crammed in...The homemade cookies are not super sweet and very good.  Had a legend trail and double chocolate chunk.  They have breakfast as well as lunch.  Their bread is homemade with out all the preservatives and contain the simple ingredients - flour, eggs, yeast, sugar, water no soy and no junk.  We had a party of 5 the patio outside should be a little bigger as it is hard to move around when it gets crowded like today.  The #7 which is a veggie sandwich was very good, and big a whole sandwich can feed two people comes with a pickle.  The egg and bacon sandwich was also very good and comes with strawberries.  Nice place to stop for a quick bite, the chairs are uncomfortable and the space is very crammed, once it gets hot outside not sure where people will go as they have limited tables inside....Pretty good food and great bread but needs more seating options to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast bakery place I ever been, it's locally owned. It's fresh delish food. I got the eggs veggies, and it blow my mind"}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast spot. Got a caramel macchiato and a blueberry muffin. The coffee was good, not too sweet, not too strong. A really good cup:)

The muffin was HUGE and so light and fluffy. Will definitely be back again to try some other things. The lunch menu looked really good:)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I'd eaten here before & thought we'd try again. The oatmeal was very soupy. I'm sure there were oats in it just appeared to be a bowl of water with a few oats. The \"pump\" coffee not to good. How do you run without having another hot backup \"pump\" ready. So I waited & waited for coffee. We chose to sit outside. Nasty cushions, dirty table tops. To top it off, they didn't have a restroom. Supposedly outside the building & down a ways. So not even in their restaurant!! We were told someone ( maybe a patron or maybe not) had locked the door & pulled in closed as they departed. Thus, all others locked out. It happened prior to the day we visited. Horrible!!!!
Don't waste your time too much problems here. Plus no gluten free items, how sad.  Enough, what a terrible experience!"}
{"text":"I've been a long time fan, even worked here in Highschool (14 years ago.) Not a lot has changed which to me, is great. All Bakery Goods are baked fresh nightly. The great morning muffin is the best in the world. I love the sandwiches and especially the Chicken Salad sandwich and the Twisted Turkey. 

All of the side options have been created fresh and all options are amazing.

I'm not huge on customer service as much as other people reviewing BC are. Bottom line for me is that the food tastes fantastic and the product is made with love. I feel far too often we treat establishments as though they owe us something. This isn't McDonald's so I'd take those customer service reviews and shove them you know where. The place isn't made to be busy so don't go on prime lunch times or you aren't going to get all the attention some of you require.

Love this place, will always love this place."}
{"text":"I've drive by a few times and tried it for the first time - HOLY AMAZING BATMAN!!!! I got the #9 chicken salad sandwich and it was AMAZING! So refreshing and it had grapes!! The tea is so fresh! The bread, oh the bread - MOUTH WATERING, so soft and just INCREDIBLE! If you haven't been here you need to! So fresh, so real! On top of it all they have samples when you walk in of yummy bread and a dip!!! {I went back for seconds - shhhhhh!}"}
{"text":"I  was nearby and starving, I needed a great sandwich to get me through the day. I ordered the full size of number six cold sandwich, Turkey, salami, ham, provolone on focaccia. The ingredients were yummy, It was awesome! I only finished half and I am excited to finish the other half later. Great cafe with a cute Ramada to sit under outside."}
{"text":"From the outside this looks like an average sandwich shop, but when you enter it's an adorable little cafe. They are making delicious sandwiches, amazing looking salads, espresso drinks, and have some great baked goods, as well. 

We got cappuccinos - which were okay, but honestly, we were just excited they had espresso!!

For lunch I tried the reuben and I am glad I did. It was delicious. The meat was tender and juicy. It was very good. I just wish the sauerkraut had been a little stronger - but that's not a deal breaker. 

My friend had the roast beef. The meat was a tad on the dry side (the reason I gave the place 4 starts instead of 5), but tasted pretty good. It had a unique southwestern spin. 

Don't pass up trying this place."}
{"text":"Breadcrafters has a small town cafe feel to it, despite being right across from a large mall. Service was friendly and I was served promptly.  I ordered soup and a sandwich, both delish!  Yes, they serve your food on styrofoam, but if you can look past that, it's a great little place to eat!  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This review is for Breadcrafters as a Cafe.  As a bakery, it had a very limited selection, at least by noon on a Saturday.

Breadcrafters is a \"one-of\" (not a chain) breakfast and lunch place just east of Paradise Valley mall, and it is a good one.  The real key to good sandwiches is good bread, so a place like this that bakes their own can have a big advantage -- if their bread is good.  In this case, it is.  Furthermore, the ingredients within the buns are fresh, tasty, and plentiful.  Special kudos to the tuna melt (not fried - just melted cheese), and a delight containing chicken and cheese.  An inventive mojito bar for dessert worked too.

Because it is fairly small, it can get crowded at peak times and I imagine that service could slow down a bit.  However, we waited only seven minutes when it was half full.

With its pleasant outdoor seating, as well as indoor, Breadcrafters is the best of class for sandwich places in Scottsdale-PV."}
{"text":"Eat here almost every day for lunch. Their rotating combination of soups and salads for their daily special always keep my meals different and exciting. 

Smiling faces that know me by name keep this place special.

Everything is always baked fresh and although I enjoy some of their options more than others I can't ever say I've been dissatisfied with something I've ordered."}
{"text":"I've been going to Breadcrafters for nearly two years now. 

I've had good experiences and bad experiences and after my last visit, I felt compelled to finally write a review.

The Food: 

Pretty decent but highly overpriced. $12+ for a little premade salad is ridiculous although, they taste alright and are fairly healthy. 

The Service:

This is why I won't be returning. It's terrible. If there is even one person in line ahead of you, please expect to wait nearly 10 minutes for them to hand you the premade salad you've ordered and then finally ring you up. Everyone is always frazzled and clearly upset with one another. It's like the owner doesn't understand basic manners or how to treat people. I've never seen an employee last more than a couple months which is understandable with how I see her openly treat them in front of guests, just imagine how she treats them when we're not around! 

Overall, the food is okay and overpriced but the service is terrible."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. I didn't even know anything about this place it's been here for awhile but never really had a desire to even try but what the heck. 

I walk in and there are a few tables inside and a bunch of tables outside with a water mister which is required for this AZ heat. Anyways, there menu is above the counter. Sandwiches, sandwiches, and more sandwiches which is fine since it's called Breadcrafters. They lady at the counter was very nice and acknowledged me right away for my order. 

I had the Southwest Chicken sandwich which is one of there hot sandwiches. It has slices of grilled chicken with grilled jalapeños, green chili, avocado on a grilled sour dough bread. Really good. Chicken was moist and the sandwich wasn't that spicy but had the right kick to it. It came with a side and I got a scoop of their potato salad. Really liked that too. I love potato salad and this didn't disappoint. Really good meal. Really good sandwich. 

So what you do is order at the counter, get your own drink, and find your own table. They bring your food to your table. They don't give you anything for your order but the people behind the counter remembers you and bring the food to your table. Very nice touch compared to all these others places. Nice personal touch. Oh yea, they even come by and take your plates away. Very nice. 

This is a very welcoming sandwich spot. Interesting spot. Very casual place. Love the personal touch. Enjoyed the food. Really good. I did notice that there were people always coming in and out of this place so it's pretty popular. So if you want different types of sandwiches then I would say give it a try. I did and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Real fresh baked bread and if you don't arrive early they may be sold out. The raisin walnut pecan bread is delicious for sandwiches and toast. The sandwich selection is vast and you can request anything you want on them. Half a sandwich is often enough due to large size. I don't like the soups, too much pepper in most and don't expect that in navy bean. 
The pastry selection is worth going for especially the fruit tarts and the legend cookie. Pies are fresh and delicious. Great for take out. Eating there only in good weather to eat outside. Not much room inside. Really worth supporting Monica and Angie."}
{"text":"Best chai latte I've ever had! Always keeps me coming back! One of my favorite breakfast spots."}
{"text":"In my top three all time favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area. They use New Times articles as wall paper. Kind of a famous out of the place that makes Mediterranean food to die for."}
{"text":"Was working in the neighborhood and stopped in for lunch. Had a half a egg salad sandwich and a small pasta pesto soup. 7.75 My food was really good. And while I was eating, I was reading the Thanksgiving menu.

Digg this:
Traditional pumpkin pie 10.95, maple pumpkin pie with toffee walnut streusel12.95 Nine pies on the menu. Other bc desserts. Creme brulee, pumpkin cheesecake. Bread, cabernet fig and apple raisin walnut. Sourdough, garlic and parmesan cheese. 

Anyway you get the idea. Wishing BC and your families a happy thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Our favorite go to lunch spot every time we come to town. I LOVE their salads. I recommend the Brie and turkey croissant !!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were lucky enough to have one of the owners make our breakfast and coffee! She was kind, humble and talented. Next time we are in town, we will be back in for another delicious meal and dessert."}
{"text":"Great food!  Inside was a little small & crowded, but they have an outside patio.  The food is well worth the trip, try it out!"}
{"text":"I happened to find this place near where I work. The food is always fresh and delicious! My favorites are the soups. Each day there is something different and they are all homemade! My favorite is the rice and abondigo and the Pozole. I have had a few different breakfast sammies and the stuffed French toast. They usually have pre made salads to go for someone who is looking for quick and healthy meal. During the holidays they always have a special catering menu that you can order from! The prime rib is amazing! They are also known for their pies too! I have had the pumpkin pie, chocolate pretzel and cherry pie! All of them were delicious! They serve everything from breakfast, lunch and dinner! Every time I go in there they are busy! I wish they had more locations because the food is delicious and fresh! Great service too! The prices are a bit higher than what you would expect for a small place like this, but the food is amazing and worth it.

I just had their southwest chicken sandwich with the stuffed avocado chicken salad! I also ordered their Valentine's Day cherry pie!!! Omg!!! Delicious all around!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, eat here often for lunch and have ordered multiple pies, including an entire thanksgiving meal.

This place is a working bakery! Arrive 5 minutes before close yes, they want to leave they have lives too. They have been there since 3 or 4 am baking. Come at lunch, to a bakery that serves lunch, yeah you will probably have to wait a few minutes. 

This is not PANERA, the kitchen is real, the food is fantastic and the people are people not android bots. 

This is a real neighborhood establishment where I have never had bad service, for awhile they knew my breakfast order and saved me my favorite muffin (Raspberry Sour Cream) gaining 5 lbs made me eat here less but it is a treat every time. 

EAT HERE you will not regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh salads and made from scratch breads and beautiful huge sandwiches combine with a locally owned restaurant with friendly, down to earth service! It's a wonderful little corner of paradise with a great patio. I will be bringing my daughter back here. It is a refreshing option for those who want to support local small business and enjoy it's talents."}
{"text":"Came in after an interview to grab a cup of coffee. Gotta day the iced mocha is way better than Starbucks!! Make sure you try the lemon bars!!"}
{"text":"We've driven by so many times and decided to give this place a try. 

It was not what I expected at all. We've been to Wildflower Bread Company many times and thought it would be similar in terms of layout, ambiance, and quality. Not even close!! Only similaritiy is the menu options.

We both had their salads which were meh.  It's all about the dressing and theirs was so bland and very acidic.  There was hardly any chicken.   For the price, I would much rather go to other restaurants for bigger portions and serve on real plates and not plastic to go containers like you get at the airport.

If you're in a mood for a salad or sandwich, you're better off with Wildflower (1st choice) or Panera's."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! I really enjoyed the #9 (Park Avenue Chicken Salad) with the Potato Salad as my side. The ladies in here are super sweet and genuine and really care about providing excellent customer service. Definitely going to come here again!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place and set up. All the food looks so delicious, especially the pastries. I tried a breakfast sandwich because it sounded really good when really I went in just for a coffee. I didn't get the coffee because the sandwich alone was just under $10. It was good with its green chills and cheese but I don't think I'd pay $10 for another one. 
Also when I walked in it took a good 3-5 mins or so to be greeted as I stood at the counter. With all my experience in customer service it's my biggest pet peeve to not be greeted as soon as I walk in the door. It's a blessing and a curse I suppose. The two ladies working were very friendly though."}
{"text":"Great spot in Paradise Valley!  Stopped in for lunch and had the warm chicken sandwich with green chilies and it was delicious!  My mom had the tuna salad which was also tasty.  The bread was fresh, crusty and didn't  over power the sandwich.  The bacon potato salad was wonderful with perfectly cooked potatoes and not too much mayo.  It was flavorful and just the right size portions.  Desserts looked amazing but we were out of room by the time we were done with lunch.  Definitely will stop by again!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a relaxing place to have an amazing breakfast and coffee, stop here. Their Green Chile Pork Burro is the perfect blend of heat and taste."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal here yet. The salads are large. Large enough to share or have half and save half for later or lunch the next day. My favorite is the Thai chicken. My husband and son are addicted to the focaccia deluxe sandwich. They love the Parmesan pesto spread that have on it. I bring home a tub of the spread (sold sep) and a bag of the toasted bread for dipping when I have company. The baked goods are also excellent. All fresh and baked on premises. My favorite is the butterscotch ranger cookie. Darn. Shouldn't have told you. Now they will be out when I go!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality!  Although I really didn't think the chicken salad had enough seasoning, I would be willing to try it again.  You could tell that they are doing a nice job.  I just ordered the wrong thing.  Would love to try breakfast sometime!"}
{"text":"My mom and I were in the area and decided it was time for lunch.  Chilly out we felt like a soup and sandwich would hit the spot.  Trusty ol' Yelp gave me BC as an option.  When we arrived we looked and and were surprised to see how small it is in here.  The seating is tight and awkward.  It was too chilly and rainy to eat out doors so we made it work.  

We decided on the half sandwich and soup of the day special.  The sandwich of the day was a roast beef with a cream cheese spread that was supposed to have horseradish and we had 3 soup choices, Tortilla soup, tomato basil bisque and chicken veggie pesto pasta.  Mom decided on the tortilla soup and while I told the lady tomato bisque I was thinkin the chicken pasta...and typical as it is when I picked up my meal on the tray instead of the tomato bisque, they served me the chicken pasta.     

The soup was plentiful.  Mom made a meal of the soup (her's was heartier than mine) and saved her sandwich.  My soup was more brothy with a dollup of pesto and had frozen style mixed veggies and an assortment of canned beans and a few pieces of pasta (didn't see any chicken).  The sandwich was just ok, when mom had hers later she too was unimpressed.  

Well this place was no Paradise Bakery but I like the opportunity to support small local business."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places in the Valley when we lived there. The baked goods are phenomenal and the food is amazing. I love the soups and sandwiches and was blown away when I tried the samples of the Thanksgiving offerings. I miss this place and recommend it to friends and family in the area on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Did a dial in and pick up order.  Ordering was easy and picking up was even easier--- they had the food ready and lunch for 5 people was about $40!  That's pretty cheap considering it was 4 sandwiches with sides (small itty bitty sides) and a salad.  I had the tuna, it was good-- not the best tuna I have had but still good.

Everyone liked their meals, I think I will try for a salad next time, it was huge and my friend really liked it.  

The inside of Breadcrafters is really cute and they have a large variety of desserts and assorted fresh breads to buy.  I need to remember this next time I need desserts and fresh bread, typically around the holiday season."}
{"text":"I love the smell of this place. It reminds me of the bakery across the street from Nonna's house back in Italy. Good real food, excellent bread. They could use a bigger place, but they do have a patio which is great in the cooler months."}
{"text":"Really fresh and tasty. I had the Poblano Verde Burro, it was excellent. We will be coming back next time we are in Scottsdale! The chicken salad stuffed avocado sounds wonderful."}
{"text":"I used to love this place when I was in high school...they had the best sandwiches. Well now, 10 years later (wow.), the sandwiches are still very tasty. I went yesterday with the BF for lunch and, despite a few flaws, it was really good. I had a half build your own sandwich and a cup of soup and the BF had a build your own sandwich. They forgot to put some of the items we asked for on both sandwiches....they forgot the BF's cheese and they forgot a couple of my veggies. Additionally, I asked for the pesto on the side and it came out on the sandwich, so I was not thrilled with that. Despite these errors, the food still tasted good. We both had turkey sandwiches, I had mine on focaccia with a bunch of veggies and the BF had his on sourdough with bacon. Both sandwiches had fresh ingredients and soft bread...very good. I also had the albondigas soup which was a bit on the greasy side, but had a lot of flavor. I'm glad this place has maintained its quality and I would definitely come back the next time I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I just tried to order a Thanksgiving pie from them. The website clearly states \"Last day to order is Nov, 23rd.\" Today is November 21st, and they told me it is too late to place an order and that the November 23rd date quoted online actually refers to the last day to pick up orders. Hmmm, maybe they should word things correctly online then??? I would have called earlier, but I thought I had plenty of time. I guess I'll be giving another company my business from now on."}
{"text":"I have to give this one star because I didn't actually taste the food. I got there on a Saturday, around 12:15, and needed something in my stomach because I had an appt down the street at 1pm. I ordered a granola yogurt parfait, and asked the guy behind the counter what flavor yogurt they used, and he did not know. I paid for it, then waited approx 25-30 minutes for it. There were tons of people waiting around for their orders. I did not have time to eat it, so I asked for a to-go container. Another ten minutes later, I still didn't have it, and asked for my money back. The lady was very frazzled and nice, and gave me a cup of fruit and bag of chips because she knew I was hungry and now did not have time to eat. I will never go there again, very poorly run"}
{"text":"This place is great!! SO MANY yummy sandwiches and salads. I love the Turkey Jack Stack, the French Dip, the Tuna Melt, the Painted Desert Cobb Salad and the Chicken Salad stuffed Avocado Salad. I often take home a loaf of fresh bread as well. YUM!"}
{"text":"I am hardly ever in the area. But sometimes i exit on the 101 and cactus and go straight down to the mall. I love there foccacia bread. I always get a sandwich and add the pesto mayo sauce to it. And no one can resist their Molten choco cookies. 

This is a great little bakery who makes traditional artisan breads. Their breads are awesome. If you are one of those whinny bitches that say, 'oh this bread is too hard' stay away. First of all, you wouldn't know what good bread is if i hit you with a day old baguette. Their bread is crispy slightly burnt on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect artistry here."}
{"text":"Cute little bakery to stop for lunch or a sweet treat. I drove by here after spending a few hours at the mall and was crossing to go to Best Buy. Even though it was too cold to sit outside on the patio, I decided to eat my lunch in here instead of taking it to-go. There was only about 6 tables with 2 chairs at each table inside but I came in during off hours so there was only 2 other people inside. The menu is very simple with the available salads all inside the see through glass fridge. I got the Monday special which was a soup and a salad for $8.00. I went with the potato leek soup and the only salad available with the combo is the chef garden salad. Both were delicious and fresh. However, I got to choose from many different dressing options. I went with the champagne vinaigrette and I asked for a side of balsamic as well just in case since I am trying something new. One nice thing is that they have tons of little samples up front of their holiday foods and also chocolate bread to try. They also have styrofoam cups with plenty of cold water and lemon wedges. One down side is the lemon wedges are cut so small that I couldn't squeeze it in my water. Next time I am in the area I may try some of the desserts!"}
{"text":"Best bakery around! Puts Blandera Bread to shame. Best scones and muffins I have ever had. The sandwiches are insanely good. This place is a try gem. Go for it!!"}
{"text":"I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to find the place, since I live just down the street but couldn't remember ever seeing this place.  Luckily I found it without too much trouble, on the corner of the strip center next to Julio G's.  

It's a cute, small place, with cases displaying their pastries and boxes of to go salads.  Lots of great patio seating outside.  They seemed slightly understaffed for the steady trickle of guests - just one girl taking the orders AND running back making all the food - I saw a couple other people working, but had no idea what they could be doing, since she was doing it all. (she was great btw and I didn't mind waiting for her)

I wanted half a sandwich with a cup of soup, which they do offer except it has to be a cold sandwich.  I also had my heart set on a hot sandwich that I saw on their website, but when I scanned the menu it wasn't even up there.  Oh well.  I got the half focaccia sandwich (turkey ham and salami with parmesan pesto) with the cup of chicken tortilla.  The soup was okay - it had potato, which I thought was odd, and they didn't give me any tortilla strips or any kind of topping for it.  The bread on the sandwich was awesome.  The meats were alright.  I liked the parmesan pesto (it definitely wasn't a pesto though - it was white instead of basil-green), but it was layed on super thick so I couldn't really enjoy the sandwich.  I got a scone to go (ended up not being very scone-like) and also a sliced loaf of the raisin walnut pecan bread.  I like the bread a lot.  Even though I didn't love my meal, I think I just got the wrong things.  I will definitely come back and maybe try a hot sandwich and another kind of soup.  They also do breakfast, so I will have to try that too."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick breakfast on break. WOW what amazing food! Service is very friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere is really nice! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So torn about this review because it wasn't the food that was bad, it was the young man at the register. He was very nice but my God was he scatterbrained, unorganized and just plain not good at his job. He seemed too overwhelmed for the small lunch rush that was there. We ordered the cranberry turkey sandwich and the Yucatan salad. He brought out the sandwich and never gave us the salad. So we waited....and my friend finally just gave me the other half of his sandwich and after 20 minutes, just asked for our money back. The sandwich was so good and the pastries looked amazing but we just wanted to go after being there for so long without so much as a heads up about an ETA of our salad. Restaurants run into problems, but it's the way you handle it that brings people back. We overheard the guy behind us as we were leaving say to the young man...   \"hey, can I please just have my damn sandwich\" . So, obviously, we weren't the only ones with issues. Small businesses like that are usually a popular spot, they need to hire someone up front that knows what's going on especially in that restaurant and test them on the menu. He was absolutely clueless."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough great things about this local sandwich shop/bakery! First off, they bake all the bread their delicious sandwiches are made on, which is also available to purchase to go. They bake gorgeous pastries, cookies, and other desserts not to be missed. My fave are the raspberry lemon bars. Back to sandwiches: so, SO good, better than any sandwich at Paradise Bakery or Panera.... my two faves are an amazing French dip with peppery housemade jus and \"Nancy's Favorite\": juicy roast beef, roasted red bell peppers, romaine, and gorgonzola spread on either a crusty baguette or sourdough. They each come with a pickle spear and a side (the potato salad is the bomb). Then there are the salads. So many of them and so fresh! All are prepped in to-go boxes which makes it quick if you're in a rush. Three types of iced tea, bottled beverages ie. Bai, and an espresso machine! I've never been for breakfast or brunch but I imagine they're incredible. Great patio with misters. Plan on spending at least  $12-15 for lunch (that includes a drink)."}
{"text":"Nice place surrounded by many fast food places. No grease here!  Breads are wonderful, but customer service was just ok.  Great pastries and part of the Belly loyalty program.  Super dog friendly as well with the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing, so tasty and fresh. An absolute must-try! Very impressed! Salads are original and well balanced, the chorizo burrito was the best i had in my life. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood gem!  They have fantastic salads and sandwiches.  Their bread is the best!  They are a little on the pricy side, and when it gets busy you might wait a bit for your food, but everyone is hustling.  One of my go to faves."}
{"text":"So my girl friend works close by and we thought we would try this place for some dessert! I hope the Food is better than the dessert. I can not say I was real impressed but it could have been what I ordered. The bread looks great and the few sandwiches I saw looked good. The thing that bothered me most about this place is that the staff did not seem very friendly. Seems like a nice bakery and a good location but I the staff could make this place a lot better and more inviting!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The smell of fresh baked bread as you walk through the door is infectious, everything looked so good with quality ingredients and the sandwiches are huge, I couldn't even finish it all it was a shame to waste because it was so yummy. The staff was extremely friendly and I enjoyed the short wait. A coworker actually recommended this place and it was a great spontaneous choice, I'll definitely return!"}
