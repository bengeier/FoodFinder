{"text":"Soup broths were good... Food seemed fresh...food came out fast... However other service was not good... We had to hail someone down each time we needed something (water to drink... Water for our soup, extra chopsticks, etc)... My husband had to go up to the counter to get service at times... Restaurant wasn't full at all at that time... At $27 per person on weekends plus soup base, it definitely isn't cheap... They also charged $14 for my 4 year old son which is high since other hotpot places in markham either charge $6 or he's free... They didn't even ask how old he was... Wasn't anything that stood out to us for us to return again..."}
{"text":"TL; DR version:  All you can eat. Owner speaks Chinese, and so are menus, BUT ENGLISH IS AVAILABLE ON REQUEST. Authentic, but a bit pricey. If you are in the neighbourhood, come and you won't regret it (that is, if you are a hotpot fan and find the price reasonable); if you are far, far, far away (say, in downtown), not used to driving a car for such a long distance and you are not a crazy hotpot addict who is determined to try out all the hotpots in GTA because you have set that as one of your life-goals (must be fantastic!), then it also doesn't hurt if you don't drop by.  ============  Came in on one Thursday. Relatively spatial, but not real big, just the typical layout any restaurant in suburban GTA would have. Decor is ok.  The soupbases are of the pricey-tier in Toronto; but, if you are a hotpot addict, I'm sure the authentic and yummy soupbases will ease your innate tensions escalated by the loss of bucks. Ordered the Beef Oil Soupbase (spicy) and Fish Soupbase (non-spicy). Even the non-spicy one was outstandingly flavourful - I didn't even expect that because usually Szechuan Hotpots only focus on spicy stuffs! The Beef Oil one is just... Literally excellent! Never tasted any other hotpot joint so far in Toronto that offers such authenticity! It is LEGIT SPICY, howver, so be advised.  They even noticed that the pot really could see some contrivance, so , in this restaurant, the Szechuan peppercorns (one of the important spices, or masterminds, behind hotpot spiciness) stay inside a sieve-like room(see the picture down below), granting the flavour to the soupbase without floating everywhere, so you dont have to take these spiciness-generators into your mouth along with the food, if you dont want to! A unique, really nice and customer-oriented design!  Good variety of food, especially when it comes to meat (yay!), I dare to say the variety and quality (in terms of all-you-can-eat meat) of them are just unbeatable so far in the GTA, far as I know.  It was a great experience overall, and I will recommend it to my friends. But since it really takes a long time to get there from my location, I am afraid if there is any chance I will go back, at least on my own."}
{"text":"Wanna try Sth new, well, it is new hot pot and Sichuan taste. It is fine but not so good compared to some hot pot, it is not easy to find dedicate hot pot in Toronto"}
{"text":"Arriving on a weeknight, the place was only at around 25% capacity.  The place overall isn't too big, with tables that are too small.  Luckily, they will provide a table extension in order to hold all the food you will be ordering.    The pricing is in the mid-high $20s, with soup bases costing extra.  You get what you pay for, with not much extra value being provided.    Service was attentive, with the wait staff coming by frequently to refill our water and soup.  Unfortunately, a few items were missed which required reordering.  The staff speaks English, Cantonese, and Mandarin.  Overall it was an average experience, which doesn't mean it's bad.  There's just wasn't really anything that makes it stand out from the many other hotpot restaurants in Markham."}
{"text":"Omg!!! They didn't wash their vegetables...there was a live bug on it. And they just ripped that part off and gave us the same bowl of vegetables. They always mess up the orders. Food never really came and they don't actually have that much varieties which is on their menu."}
{"text":"Best sichuan style hotpot ever. I haven't found any hotpot place in GTA that can match this restaurant. It is very authentic and the service is good and fast. The broth is very tasty and the spice is strong. If you are a spice lover you should definitely give it a try. If you cannot take any spice, you can also try other non-spicy broth. I will definitely going back for this restaurant and next time I will bring more friends to try it out!"}
{"text":"Great new HotPot place in Markham!  Food: lots of variety, it wasn't missing a single thing I was craving.  Portions are plentiful and a lot of sauces to choose from as well.  I particularly liked their oxtail tomato soup base, it was flavourfuland a must try!  A lot of homemade spicy options as well but we didn't try.  Only improvement would be the shrimp, it was way too frozen when served.  Two types of dessert offered as well.  Service: Outstanding!  Both servers are very friendly and attentive.  Soup constantly refilled, explained menue and recommendations and pricing.  Been to other larger hot pot places where service was a turn off, so this was great.  Can speak english and cantonese (probably mandarin as well), and menues in both english and chinese.  Value: pretty good, $26.99 pp for friday to sunday, plus soup base and drinks.  Take advantage of their Groupon deal if you want to save $8 ($12 for $20 credit).  Will definitely return again for my next hotpot craving!"}
{"text":"Too Hot Hotpot Food:  TLDR: Great savory and unique soup base, fresh meat. More expensive than ordinary hot pot, but worth giving it a try. Went to this new hot pot spot to celebrate my friend getting a new job. To start off, the soup base is literally one of a kind. I've never had such a rich, and tasty soup base in any other location. We tried their staple spicy soup base (which has a whole scoop of butter in it, delish!) and the tomato beef bone soup base (which tastes line a borsche soup base) to which I would recommend the latter.  Usually other hot pot places refill your soup with plain water, not this place. They refill it will a full body chicken soup base or something similar. Needless to say, the richness of the soup base lasts till we're done, amazing.  The meat is fresh, they have a few unique items such as the duck tongue. Not my cup of teat but I know alot of people love it. One thing I like to emphasize is the veggies. At most other hot pot places, the veges turn out tasteless and bland, but with the rich soup base, the veggie turn out extremely delicious!  Though it is more expensive than other hotpot places and you need to pay for the best soup bases. I feel like its defintely worth it, even if only once, to try out their specialty!   ---------------------------- Service:  Now this isn't like a regular restaurant five stars service. Its a hot pot place five star. I literally hate going to hot pot for the sole reason that the service is ALWAYS horrible, usually the servers treat me like i killed their mom or something. Compared to those places, this joint's servers a nicer, and easier to approach. And because its smaller, they won't ignore you like the other places!   ---------------------------- Ambiance:  This is a hidden gem, the location is right behind first markham place. You might think that's really easy to find, but its still pretty hidden with only one entrance to this massive plaza.  The inside is smaller than most common hot pot place with fewer than 20 tables. The setup however isn't as packed as one might expect. The restaurant is newly opened and very clean. Hope they keep it up cause I'd love to keep going to a clean hot pot joint for once   -------------------- Parking:  There are lots of parking for the plaza, but some of them are marked for specific units. I highly doubt anyone will come ad tow your car if you park there. But in case you feel uneasy about that, there're always mote spots around the corner or on the other side of the plaza  -------------------- Price:  This is hands down one of the most expensive places i've had hot pot in. The base price is more expensive than other places. But the broth is just sooo good!! Just can't help myself but eat all the veges with their beef bone tomato broth!!"}
{"text":"Went on a weeknight when there was barely anyone and the service was great! just some of the things we ordered didn't come out until we ordered a second time.  the soup bases are really good! we got the spicy beef with the oil on top and got the pork bone soup. now have to say, these are the best hot pot soup bases I've ever tried in any hot pot places in the GTA.Very very flavourful.   the selection was better than most hot pot places too!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place I ever been. Lor is way overpriced. They never bring the right food for my order. I found a bug in the soup, that horrified me. I would put a negative star if yelp has this choice. Don't try this place."}
{"text":"I'm dropping my review for this place to a 2.5. Came here recently and was not impressed. The management definitely has changed. The guy who used to always be there wasn't there that night. Maybe it was his night off? But the girl who was working was alright nothing special.   When we got there around 7 there was a group of people sitting a table already who I saw hanging out in the front smoking. We got seated at the table next to them. What was weird was that one of the guys at the other table came over to us and gave us the menu and asked if we have been here before....like are you our waiter?....why are you sitting with your jacket on with your friends?.....are you staff??? wtf man.  What really dropped my review down is the quality in the food. The lobster ball now has too much starch in it. The portions of food they give you are so thinly sliced it's like rice paper thin. The veggies that they give are also like half the portion as before. Also the dessert used to be a highlight here. The jelly used to come with crushed roasted peanuts but now that has even changed. The peanuts are no longer there and the jelly is so watered down it's not even worth wasting calories on.   The price of this place is absolutely not worth it if you do not get the groupon. Even with the groupon it is steep. We got the groupon and on a wednesday night it came to $30 a person with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Horrible place, service flat out offensive, when ask for more meat politely we got shop owner's Sh5t face. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT"}
{"text":"With Groupon, it's a very decent hot pot option. I love that they have dessert options, but it'd be nice to have those options available in English as well. I don't read Chinese, so that got a tad confusing. I got the fried buns with condensed milk. This is the first time in my life that the condensed milk didn't come on the side. They also served it in one of those wicker ish baskets, and the condensed milk leaked out of the basket and made for a sticky table situation. Highlights include king oyster mushrooms, egg tofu, and ox tongue. Yummy. Soup bases cost extra, so be warned."}
{"text":"This is a small and private hot pot spot behind First Markham Place. The food was fresh and soup base was okay. I wish they had more selections at their dipping sauce counter. Also they do not have a liquor license. Overall the bill came to $80 for 2 people on a Saturday night and is a bit pricey for what I got."}
{"text":"Delicious AYCE hot pot.  Located behind First Markham Place next to other restaurants.  My friends and I are very satisfied with the quality of food here.  Note: the spicy soup base is very spicy!  Even \"mild\" is pretty spicy.  I was a bit disappointed they did not have the 4 soup base pot available.  It was not very busy there either.  Hopefully next time.  Friendly service, food quality was excellent.  Staff did not complain when we kept asking for refills of the drink or more food.  They offered us a more comfortable seat which was nice.  Price is around the same as other hotpot places, which has gone up over the years."}
{"text":"I went there because of the Groupon coupon.  $20 coupon for$2.00. It was a nice AYCE Chinese hotpot experience. We were there on a Sunday night and they are not busy at all.  $24.99 per person and hotpot soup is $6.99. $57+ tax + tips. I won't pay this price for 2 people. It is worth it if you use the Groupon. All ingredients were fresh.  the pork belly is the best and i would recommend to order it. The Sichuan hot pot base was extremely spicy, i like it."}
{"text":"For the price I paid, I don't think it's worth it. Sure it's a different experience compared to other hot pot places (think Szechuan style), but I think with the influx of northern Chinese immigrants into the GTA, there will be more options to come.  Too Hot Hotpot is located inside First Markham Centre, which is the plaza across from First Markham Place (enter via Fairburn or Rodick), same plaza as A La Kitchen. It's newly opened, and I found out about this place via a CCUE 10% off coupon in Sing Tao.  The menus here are all in Chinese, but I presume English menus are available if requested. While you're already paying a high set price, there's extra cost for some broths, so do be warned. Drinks are also not included aside from water.  I ordered many of the staples, such as sliced beef, premium beef, lamb, red sausage, northern-style cuttlefish balls, etc. Not sure how to describe the northern-style cuttlefish balls, but they're similar looks to the turnip cake you get at Sam's Congee Delight. Either way...everything was, for the most part, okay. The sliced beef, however, was not good. They claimed in the advertisement that it's angus beef, but I definitely didn't feel it...felt like it was your typical A grade beef. The premium beef was better though, but they don't offer a lot per order.  And on that note...despite how many orders you input in the order form, it seems you always only get a set amount (and it's not a large amount as well). You'll likely have to keep ordering in order to satisfy your hunger if you're eating here.  I didn't like the service here overall, especially for the price I paid. Normally I wouldn't care too much if it's one of the lower end hot pot places (think Kim Tao), but for ~$30 a head I definitely expect some form of service. However, given the lack of direction on how to order, the lack of portions despite me asking for more than given, and general not-so-kindness, I can't give this place a good review.  For 10% off, this place is just okay. Once that promotion is done, however, I can't see this place surviving given the location, prices, and quality."}
{"text":"Pro: The oxtail tomato soup base was absolutely delicious. Best tomato base soup base I've ever had (and I've tried many hot pot places).   Gave this place a try because of the Groupon deal. If there was no Groupon deal, I probably wouldn't have came here because the soup bases are pricier compared to other places. It's located in the small plaza behind FMP, so don't worry there will be parking since there's nobody here. We walked into the restaurant and it was completely empty.. during dinner time. We got seated at the booth seats and holyyyyyy the table was SO SMALL there was no room to put the plates, which was why they have this tiny fold table on the side of our booth for our food. Still, the table was so small there's probably 6 inches from the pot to my chest. Literally \"too hot hotpot\" because the hotpot was boiling so hard and the table was so small that the soup kept splashing onto me and burned me multiple times, and that stuff hurts. There was no dessert provided, not sure if it's because we bought the Groupon deal???   Basically, this place is way too pricey for the quality they're offering. The variety of their food and sauces is extremely narrow and the quality of the food isn't that great, aside from the soup base I ordered. I'd rather go to Morals Village if I have to spend this much. Also, my friend had stomach problems on the same night after eating here lol, and he said he will never come back again."}
{"text":"I feel like their name too hot hotpot is accurate because they came over to ask to turn off the stove because it was on for too long and the heat was amplifying the gas smell. Y'know, like the hot pot is too hot, so they turn it off... before we're done eating.   I asked them to turn it back on after a while so we could cook the food we had left. He turned it on and kindly added more soup base... And then took away the plate of food... ... ... ... I had nothing else to cook.   Disorganization aside, this place is ok. They offer a wide variety of hot pot items. The quantity they give when ordering is occasionally hard to gauge, \"1\" will literally mean one beef ball, but will also mean one plate of sausage, so it's best to start with \"1\" of everything. All items are standard hot pot quality. The pork bone soup was really rich in pork flavour. I prefer it over the original spicy i-don't-remember-because-it-was-mediocre soup base. Also, the plum juice is weak."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and understanding when we didn't know how to order and the food was decent."}
{"text":"Fresh food and tasty broth, price is reasonable,  Groupon isn't saving so much though."}
{"text":"We were just looking for hotpot and came across it here on Yelp. The reviews here are somewhat accurate but a little dated. Straight up, the reason for the bad review is because of the price. There is no way we're going to be paying $35-40 per person at a Chinese hotpot place without legitimate seafood. The kind of money we were paying is equivalent to a proper sit down place where people cook your food. I can understand overhead costs and raw cost of materials/ingredients but you're cooking your own food.  Venue: nice and modern, steamy as can be expected of a hotpot joint  Food: Tasty broths and the spicy ones are really spicy so don't be too ambitious with the amount of chili. Meats and vegetables were fresh and good. Nothing outstanding but also nothing to really complain about.  Service: Waiters and waitresses were mediocre - could speak English and Chinese but were a little slow to bring items and react.  Price: Just awful. No way can you justify the $35-40/head cost  tldr Come here for hotpot if you're really craving it and you're not willing to go any further."}
