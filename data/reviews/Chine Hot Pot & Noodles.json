{"text":"Cecily is the manager, very helpful and suggested great dishes. So glad I stopped by! Tomato broth is too good. Again highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's a 3.5 stars review. 

As mentioned in other reviews, spacious, pretty clean compared to other established Chinatown hotpot locations. 

Personal sized hot pot. 

Went for family day lunch. $2 is added totalling $25.99 per adult. 

Drinks extra. 

Soup base is extra as well ranges from $2.5 - $3. 

Ordered lamb, pork, tofu, fish balls, mushroom, and veggies. 

Meat quality is decent. 

Overall, it's a place I will go again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to many Chinatowns and many Hot Pot places across North America. So far this is the best and most home-like hot pot we had. There are lot side dishes and borth for you to chose from. You can also mix your own dipping sauce. We personally recommend the Black Chicken and the Spicy one. Be alarm since they made the broth fresh when you order, so the suicide or killer spicy soup may not be   spicy at the beginning; it will turn real HOT after boiling for a bit. Everything else is clean and tidy and the service is awesome. Also, save room for dessert since all 3 options are super good. Pay with CASH and you will get 10% off. Overall this is a perfect 10."}
{"text":"This is the best hot pot I have ever had in Canada. It is clean and the staff is friendly. You can enjoy the traditional Sichuan hot pot as well as delicious snacks such as Legendary Deep Fried Pork Slice and fried taro roll."}
{"text":"I love Chinese hot pot especially on a cold winter's day. I'm so glad that Chine has opened up near Kensington Market. It is by far the best hot pot in the city.
Fresh ingredients, delicious sauces and friendly staff ~ what more could you ask for.
It's also all you can eat and it's yummy!!

The black chicken hot pot is my favorite, I'll definitely go back. :)
Keep up it up Chine!! :)"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend while on vacation. I'd  never eaten hot pot before. The staff explained how to order and gave recommendations. I picked the tomato broth and my friend had the spicy broth. We ordered thinly sliced lamb, five spice beef, chicken, tofu and vegetables for our first course. You can mix your own dipping sauce from a variety of ingredients. We ordered Ramen and udon  for our second course. We were offered dessert but were  too full. Based on this experience, I would definitely go back and will try hot pot again. 

I only took a pic after we had already eaten. There wasn't  much left.

If you pay in cash you get 10% off your bill."}
{"text":"Finally a legit hot pot in downtown Toronto!  This place is great with high quality meats and ingredients. The staff is very friendly and helpful. My wife mistakenly ordered a broth that was too spicy for her and they kindly replaced it for free.  We're def coming back! Best hot pot on the Spadina strip."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite all you can eat hot pot place in downtown Toronto. They have a really good selection of items and the ingredients are all very fresh. All that being said, they do tend to forget to bring out things you have ordered. I know it's an all you can eat place but it can still be a little frustrating waiting for food that will never come. Other than that, this is a great all around restaurant!
Ps. Make sure you try all their deserts bc they are so so good!!"}
{"text":"(Beware: this fantastic Chinese eatery offers both AYCE HOTPOT, AND (non AYCE) affordable noodles.

THEIR HOTPOT IS SIMPLY WONDERFUL BEYOND DESCRIPTION, as others' reviews will testify in unison.

But mine will be focused on its NOODLES.
So, if you're looking for hotpot info, please just ignore me and scroll down to see what others say in astonishment about this decent place. I do come often for its hotpot, though.}

=======

TL;DR version:

FOOD (here, specifically the noodles, NOT the AYCE) 4.5 / 5

NOTE: they serve noodles ONLY BETWEEN 11 am to 4 pm, after which there will only be hotpot available

+Great portion of tasteful beef (or other ingredients, depending on what you order) at a price of $9~$11 only
+Worth the price, in terms of affordability
+\"Hand-made\" noodles crafted in Chinese Sichuan style

N.B.: Not everyone will be pleased by the flavour of the noodles, I suppose; so if you hesitate, take their All-you-can-eat hotpot menu instead, you won't be disappointed.

----

I once doubted if anyone ever noticed the full name of this Hotpot Mt. Everest - \"Chine Hotpot & NOODLES\". If you figure the \"noodles\" for their udon and vermicelli available for your flavorful All You Can Eat Hotpot, you've just made a lovely mistake.

In fact, recently they start to offer affordable noodles priced between $9 to $11 - with about four or five different kinds of noodles, if I remember it correctly.

The noodles are done in Chinese style, or more specifically, Szechuan(Sichuan) - Chongqing manner. So it might not fit everyone's mouth with a desirable flavour. However, if you are a somewhat aficionado of spicy Chinese food, like I am, I suggest you give it a try.

----
In this review,  I wrote about the spicy beef noodles.

You can ask the level of spiciness to be adjusted, just like what you can with your spicy hotpot here. They have \"normal spicy\" and \"greatly spicy\" for this one.

The beef (or other ingredients in your bowl; I only tried beef noodles, so...) came in a large portion, so large I was surprised when it arrived: I am supposed to pay only $9 for the entire bowl, right?

The noodles were literally buried deep beneath the beef slices. FYI, these beef slices are exactly what you get if you order Chine's Special Beef Slices for your AYCE Hotpot. Noodles were well made, the entire bowl was delicious for me.

The overall experience of it was just great. But, trust me, no greater than their hotpot - which is where their fame came from. You won't wanna miss it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having hotpot at a restaurant. The staff were very helpful in navigating the menu and helping us decide what and how much to order. She was very friendly and service was prompt. We went in at 10pm, a little later than is advisable as they close at 11pm with last call for orders at 10:30. But we were not rushed in the slightest. The beef slices were fresh and delicious. The broth was fantastic and there was a good selection of items for creating sauces. My favourite part was actually the ramen noodles, which were chewy and delicious. Having tested a number I the different options, I look forward to going back as we'll have a better plan for what we most want to eat.

The desserts (golden bread?) were fantastic and I wished I had followed her advice and ordered more. Basically, my five stars is mostly because it was great food but the service was exceptionally helpful.

Discount if you pay cash."}
{"text":"Went in with a few buds and left with a great experience! Service was top notch and they were always checking up on us. Food was great and is definitely one of the better hot pot places to go to. The thinly sliced lamb, beef and enoki mushrooms were my favourites. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I am from Sichuan.Chine hotpot is very authentic. The legendary spicy broth is so good! Highly recommend!!! Beef,lamb,pork are nicely sliced. Vegetables are so fresh. Oh,the fried pork slice is amazing, the Sichuan pepper make my tough so numb,but I love it. The piced beef is nicely stewed and cut. Decent decoration, good and active.services!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to try a hot pot meal. The staff were very helpful and gave us great advice. The food was terrific!"}
{"text":"Ambience was great. Interior is nice and clean. Our waitress got our orders using her phone. Came in for the lunch special ($14.99) and ordered different broth for each person. We got to choose 4 meats and 4 vegetables from the menu to add to our broth for each person. Ordered the beef combo others ordered seafood. Broth to choose from: Chicken, mushroom and spicy broth. Theres also plenty selection of dipping sauce you can choose from. Everyone enjoyed their meals with plenty of leftovers. Just make sure to bring cash / card debit (canadian).  Overall a great place. - From the Bay Area."}
{"text":"We have been in Toronto for about a week, we were in need of something different, delicious and nutritious...Chine Hot Pot hit the mark!

The service was exceptional, the vegetables, meat and shrimp were all fresh and delicious.

Next time we are in Toronto, we will make sure to visit Chine! 

One tip: Bring Cash for a 10% discount, also Credit Cards are not accepted"}
{"text":"I was here twice since it opened, This is the best hotspot I've had in Toronto! Not cheap(compare with little sheep), but worth it! The service is nice, and the food is awesome! Fresh and delicious!  I will come back whenever I want hotpot!"}
{"text":"Do NOT come here as a twosome unless you enjoy being treated like a 3rd class human.

The restaurant doesn't understand how to manage the logistics for two.

A quick recap of my experience
1) my group of two and another group of two (who'd been waiting a solid forty minutes) were in the front of the line
2) two tables cleared
3) a random group of four and three walked in (no reservations), and were immediately dropped into the two fresh tables 

One of the staff explained to the four of us that the other groups got the tables specifically because they were tables for four.

Therein lies the problem. I understand restaurants control throughout by allocating larger tables for larger groups (that's basic), but at this restaurant, smaller tables DO NOT EXIST.

Since there are no tables designed for less than four, and since they automatically give priority to a group of four/three to these tables regardless of the order in which people came in, groups of two are unequivocally screwed.

They wasted an hour of our lives, when the HUMANE thing would have been to just tell us to get out when we walked in, since they never had any intention of serving us anyway."}
{"text":"This is by far the best chinese restaurant ive been to in canada!

Chongking style Hotpot is extremely good and authentic!(well i would say not enough for me as someone grew up in a very spicy province in china, but as far as canadian restaurant goes, I cannot find a better one :)  it is about mild spicy if you do it in chongking or sichuan just FYI) but numb is real

Price is very affordable, stuff is more than extremely nice, which is something unusual in an asian restaurant! I rarely give more than 10% tips unless in quebec, but this is the one makes me feel guilty if i dont do 20%. The reasons are below: 
The one served me made some very nice recommendations which I really enjoy. They do disturb me with standard dumb questions like \"is everything alright\", but they just happen to show up whenever I actually need something, from adding water, ordering another round, to bring down the curtain when it is glaring and lift it up when it is enjoyable outside, taking empty plates, pointing out washroom etc., without making me actively ask for anything once for help in 2 hours dinning experience. I've had too many knock-yourself-out buffet service in other places. This is the one makes me feel I was actually well-served without annoying me. 
I cannot say for others though, experience may vary, maybe it is because it is not very full at the time.

The place is really clean, and the atmosphere is quite good as well.
I saw some comments whine about ventilation, honestly I did not feel it at all. I mean it is hotpot, you should understand there will be some hot air hit you. I did not smell anything from other tables.

The only thing im not 150% happy with is they do not accept credit card, but i can live with that.
Bring cash for 10% off."}
{"text":"Nous avons souper avec nos trois enfants à ce très bon restaurant. Nous avons pris la formule all you can eat et nous avons pu choisir notre bouillon dans lequel nous avons fait cuire toutes sortes de bonnes choses !!!!! Toute la famille y a trouvé son compte :)"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Wednesday night with three others and was seated promptly. Tables are large and well apart from each other. Each table has a little steel cart that can be tucked beneath the table or pulled out and used to hold plates of food. Sauce mixing table made concocting our own dips easy, service was fast and attentive. Variety was good and fresh, downside is that no dumplings of any sort, but I would trade no dumplings for good everything else, which is what I got. Tea and water are free but pop is $2.50 a can so if you e got a sweet tooth be prepared to pay. Speaking of sweet tooth, get their simple but tasty fried buns with condensed milk. And watch out for the Szechuan peppers tucked away in some of their \"chile\" meat offerings . Ventilation pretty good, also wish the bathroom had heating so that's really what the knocked off star is for"}
{"text":"This place is busy but we still got great service. I like the fact you get your own hot pot and there are options for vegetarians or non- pork/ beef eaters. There are lot of choices and my recommendations are the seafood, veggies (there are a lot choices), konnayaku, and noodles. It's perfect for groups of four, 6 or larger or even date night. They also have sauces you can select from a sauce booth. Expect a wait on peak hours but they try their best to seat people promptly."}
{"text":"One of my favourite hot pot places downtown! Chine is all individual pots, they have a great menu, sauce selection, and a variety of broths.

The food (4/5): I've had 3 broths here: mushroom, black chicken, 3 ingredient. All the broths I've had have a very distinctive taste so definitely worth trying them all out. In terms of the menu its pretty extensive and will happily fulfill any hot pot customers taste. From the many variety of meats, vegetables, noodles, and other sides you can't go wrong here. They'll give you exactly what you order so be careful ordering 10 lambs and 10 beef knowing you're only 4 people lol. The sauce station is my favourite as its all laid out pretty neatly for you to pick, choose, and experiment. However, the sauce station does get alittle hectic when the places is packed. 

Price (3.5/5): like many other hot pot places, there is a set price and then you add on extra for the broth. On weekdays its $23.99 + ~$2-$3 for broth. On Fridays and weekends expect the set price to be $2 more. I wouldn't say this was cheap, but it's pretty standard for hot pot nowadays.

Service (3.5/5): Hit or miss depending on when you go. From M-Th the restaurant isn't packed so you'll always have the servers attention. However from F-Sun it'll definitely be harder. I'd suggest coming with a Chinese friend because it's much easier to communicate with the servers that way lol. Food comes in pretty quick tbh, then later on you won't be able to keep up haha. Overall the service here isn't anything short of what you'd find at any restaurant along Spadina. 

Ambience (4/5): Chine fairly clean, and its great that they've got an roll out shelf to hold extra food for larger groups. Some of the booth seats may feel cheap, but the restaurant itself has got decent seating capacity and clean enough for my liking."}
{"text":"Terrible service, poor management! We waited at the table for 30mins, gave the waiter our order, nothing was served, not even water. We asked them a couple times, and still just been waiting. Other tables who came after us already started eating. We left in the end cuz there's really no point waiting anymore. I will never go back and will not recommend it to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Having not visited China in the past few years, I will take my friends' words that this place \"looks just like I'm back in Chongqing\". The meat and seafood selection is fairly standard and of good quality, but with nothing particularly extraordinary. The broth base is flavorful (I had mushroom) but just slightly salty for my taste. There is also a wide DIY selection of sauce bases, and all-you-can-eat chicken feet (not very good) and butterfly pastry (decent).
For Vancouver I'd probably give this place 3 stars, but in Calgary it deserves 4+."}
{"text":"Food: very good broth, very authentic and tasty. Especially good if you like spicy broth.

Veg and meat slices are very fresh and their special dishes are also very good and not found at other hot pot restaurants.

Many ingredients are available to make your own sauce and tailor it to your own liking. 

Very clean washrooms, and decor.

Staff are very attentive and very nice."}
{"text":"Food was fresh but selection was average, nothing special. Service was great, the waitresses were very attentive."}
{"text":"Great place for good food at a good price! But they use MSG in the soup so take that into consideration. Regardless, a place worth a visit if you are into nice hot pots!"}
{"text":"Not bad, got the lunch special, $12 for 4 meats and 4 vegetable plus rice/ramen/udon noodles. Free broth. 

Portion of the dishes were quite small, but you can't expect much for $12. 

I ordered 3x tenderloin pork slice, 1x chicken slice, shiitake mushrooms, corn, bean curd slice and broccoli. 

Measured it out with a scale, it was 100g of pork total for 3 dishes and 100g of chicken breast total for 1 dish. Two small cons of corn, 2 shiitake mushrooms, a handful of bean curd slices and 2 pieces of broccoli. 

The only thing that seemed really little was the pork in terms of weight. It was a stack of pork slices on their small plate. Seemed like a lot but turned out to be 100g. They definitely sliced it thinner than normal. The pieces of pork looked smaller than regular all you can eat sized pieces that my friend had, who I was eating with. About half the size. They probably took one piece and cut it in half, rolled it up and stacked them to look larger than it was. 

In terms of taste the chicken and pork broth was good. It came with a handful of shiitake and white mushrooms in it and some other soup ingredients. The pot got extremely hot, hotter than I expected it would which made it really easy to cook food quickly. I was surprised at how good everything tasted. As I'm not a huge fan of hotpot cuisine. The chicken and pork was extremely tender, cooked quick. The broccoli, mushrooms, and bean curd all tastes fresh and flavourful from the broth. The corn was probably the best thing I had, extremely sweet and crisp. It was really clean. The tables, eating utensils, plates and bowls were spotless. Went to the washroom and it was probably the cleanest washroom in a restaurant I've been too. 

It wasn't too packed, about half full during lunch time.

I'd rate it 8/10, if you get the all you can eat menu then you would be very satisfied. If you don't eat much like me then the combo will do fine. I left full, not stuffed and didn't finish the rice."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this restaurant!

First, you choose your broth. I chose this deliciously fire red spicy caldron broth. Don't know what it's called, but it's good. Just plan on drinking lots of water to cool that down a little.

Then they bring out the meats, seafood, tofu, and vegetables to add to the boiling beast. These cuts of lamb, pork, and beef are cut paper thin. They come out to the table looking like works of art. Fantastic presentation on this. The only thing you have to worry about is overlooking them. They are so thin they'll cook up in a minute or two.

The seafood is quite good also. I'd give the nod to the shrimp and fish. Both are super good. Just be a little careful with these. Since they're much thicker than the meats, they hold on to their boiling temperature longer. Give them a little time to cool down after you remove them from the caldron. Burned my lip.

On the vegetable side, the sweet potatoes are the hit. I boiled mine for so long they would fall apart as I brought them to my mouth. But wow, they soaked up that spicy broth flavor...incredible.

Look, this should sum up my experience. I live 600 miles (965 km) away from this place, and I'm still trying to figure out how to get back to it soon."}
{"text":"This place is as close as it gets to a northern China style hot pot in Toronto.  Having tried hotpot in Beijing, I was pleased to see a lot of the same soup bases and sauces that I saw there.  The sauce station had high quality ingredients like sesame sauce, sesame oil, and minced garlic.  The use of induction cooktops and individual pots at the tables makes the dining experience much better than most places, where the group has to decide on a soup base everyone can agree on.

I got the Legendary broth (mild), which is actually medium, because there's a half mild broth that's less spicy.  For my tastes, the mild is spicy enough, and I got the nice numbing flavour of Sichuan peppercorns along with the chiles.  Ingredients are fresh and creative, like tender bamboo shoots, quail eggs, and lots of mushrooms along with the usual suspects like lamb and beef, and noodles and dumplings.  Our group also got some 'interesting' ingredients like pigs blood and kidney, as well as tripe which seemed fresh as well.

Dessert is the deep fried dough sticks or mantou dipped in condensed milk, which was a hit with everyone."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! I've been wanting to find Hot Pot ever since my friend from China introduced me to it years ago. 

This place is an all you can eat and a little on the pricy end but the food was really good. Everyone gets an individual pot, flavour of their choice, we chose the house special and boy was it hot! 
You get the order from a variety of other options and I love the fish balls and beef. They also have a desert option which I wasn't going to try but the owner asked us to give it a go, it was fired Toro (not sure about the name) and super delicious. 

Definitely a fun place to try with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Originally my friends and I made the mission to go to Chinatown for some bombass dimsum, but we were quickly faced with disappointment at how packed the restaurants were. Mind you, this was the morning after a night of clubbing so we were all starving, cold, and possibly hungover. 

We decided to browse around and came across Chine. Immediately upon going in, it was not as crowded (thank da lord) and the host quickly sat our party of 7 and was very accommodating! You can choose between a set meal or AYCE - which of course we chose AYCE cuz we were on the verge of starvation. 

There were lots of options to choose from and all the ingredients were fresh! For the most part, everyone ordered a different broth and were impressed with how flavourful and delicious it tasted. For myself, I got the tomato base soup and it was ahhhhmazing! 

You're welcome to a self-serve sauce bar where you can create your own sauce - lots of options so get creative! 

The servers were very nice about everything - making sure to check up on us, apologizing after forgetting to bring a dish for us, giving us water immediately whenever we asked for it... very rare for a hot pot restaurant! I definitely enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"Feel love! Chine Hot Pot has several type of broths which make every visit is different. I had KillerSpicy this time, delicious!!"}
{"text":"Meh. I had the \"premium\" beef weekday lunch combo. The beef was w/e. The combo portions were TINY. an order of meatballs it's literally 2 meatballs. The meatballs are all gross. An order of corn is 2 tiny disks, etc. The \"crispy sausages\" were just tiny hot dog weinners. The meat options all sucked. The order of broccoli was one little thing of broccoli split in half.

For the 2 of the 4 veggie options I ordered 2 spinach. My 2x spinach was the same size as my husband's 1x spinach.

Our server was coughing into everything and not making any effort to cover his mouth. Why was he even working if he's sick?

My combo was $15 pre-tax during weekday lunch, but for that price I could do ayce hot pot at a different restaurant for weekday lunch, with meat options that are not nasty chewy meatballs."}
{"text":"Yup, this is a hotpot place--its windows are all steamed up. It was super packed on a weekday night when we went and the ambiance felt like we were transported back to China. 
They note your name and number so you know which place you are in line and you'll also receive a message when it's your turn; this was great. 

Soup bases are an additional $2.50-$3 on top of the $23.99 weekday price. It isn't the cheapest hotpot place, but the quality was excellent and it is well worth it if you come hungry. 

While waiting for your food to come, go create your own dipping sauce at the condiment table. Just choose what you like and mix and voila, you are a chef :) Everyone gets their own pot and stove with 3 heat settings. You can go grab your own water, tissues and spoons on the trolleys. 

Meat and veggies were fresh. The fried foods were delicious, the mantou and taro roll were fried to order and oh so crispy. 

Two things that we would have liked offered :
- free soy milk / plum juice (these were $1.50 here)
- lamb 

There is a 5% off cash special, and the place also accepts debit."}
{"text":"Amazing hot pot experience!! Went for the lunch menu and they had a TON of options available. The tomato broth was amazing! Hint: Suicide=medium spice level and killer=hot. Would recommend the seafood, pork, and tofu!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious! I recommend the black chicken broth and supreme beef. The decor is cool and the service was good. It was a little to expensive though for what you get and they forgot to tell us they surcharge $2 Fri to Sunday but they do give 10% cash discount."}
{"text":"Came here from seeing the good reviews and it was definitely not as good as I expected it to be. I will also not be returning as there are far better hot pot places in the area. 

The food:
The lamb slices are so fatty that you're basically throwing away half the meat. And it kind of lacks that lamb aroma. (UPDATE: as per the owners comment, he thinks I had pork instead of lamb. I am a hot pot addict and I have hot pot at least once a month, I would be able to differ lamb from pork. I also never order pork for hot pot) 
The spicy pot tastes okay, until you realize you have a full mouthful of oil. You can even see a thick layer of oil floating on top of the soup. 
No ice-cream like other downtown ayce hot pot places. And no drinks are included like little sheep hot pot. 
Tripe is super hard no matter how fast you cook it. 

The service
All the servers here look like students. When you ask them something, they would look at you (sometimes nod) and walk away. None of them would verbally reply to you - not even an  \"okay\", so you would just hope that they knew what you have asked them for. It wasnt just one server, but all of them.
When we asked for a separate bill and some of us got drinks, the waitor seemed so mad and  said do you have to split it so clear? 
If you are splitting our bill already, why not do it properly?!"}
{"text":"I would give zero star if I was able to. The waiter is extremely rude. I went for lunch when there were more than five open tables, and was asked to sit beside a couple and share the table. At least two tables were occupied by single patties at that time. The waiter then told me that they imposed a minimum consumption limit for the specific table that I was to sit in, and they were free to modify the rule for specific customers. 
He refused to answer my questions and asked me to leave. I feel offended and discriminated."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to have individual hot pots for lunch and decided to check this new place out, this was not so legendary other then the level of heat you like in your soup. They have beyond spicy broths to mild and regular flavour broths. The selection of sauces for dipping is wider then other hot pot places i have been to. They also have raw eggs you can choose to crack into your broth, which no other hot pot places offer. The selections of meats, seafood & veggies are normally the same as others, their starch options are also the same as others. I had a Satay broth with beef and chicken with fish cakes and variety of veggies and udon. My friend chose the Chinese herbal broths. Which was tasty. Legendary however i did not find that so. This is a worth it place to come for lunch in the winter or fall. Summer, not so much. I rather have Korean cold noodles."}
{"text":"I looove hot pot and I'm so glad I gave Chine a try! Located right in the heart of Chinatown, Chine offers all you can eat hot pot for lunch and dinner. Everyone gets their own pot and there are various soup bases to choose from ($2.99 to $3.99). I got their signature spicy broth - half mild. The broth was very tasty so I would order the same thing next time. The menu is reasonably extensive with the standard meats (beef, lamb, chicken, and pork) as well as a variety of vegetables to choose from. You place your order using the menu sheet (separated into 3 columns which indicates 3 rounds of ordering) and the waiter/waitress enters the order into a tablet. It seems pretty efficient. There is also an open sauce bar with a huge selection - skip the soy sauce as I'd recommend their Chine house special sauce instead. The only thing they didn't have available were eggs (which I usually like to add into my sauce mix) but not a deal breaker. EDIT - The owner messaged me to let me know that you can get eggs from the servers! Woohoo :)

Service was very attentive. My water cup was pretty much never empty because the servers kept coming around to refill. The only tiny gripe I have is that the ventilation is not very strong so expect all of your clothing to smell like hot pot afterwards. This isn't unusual for hot pot places though. Also, cash (5% discount) or debit only. Overall, great place to check out - I'm sure I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a Friday night around 5 pm. We were seated right away but by the time we left around 7 there was a ton of people waiting, so I would recommend going early. The food was pretty good, there were a good selection of options and there's a sauce bar where you can make your own soy sauce combinations. The individual pots were kind of nice because since they were smaller, they heat up faster and it doesn't take long to cook whatever's in your pot. The seafood seemed fairly fresh and I really liked the squid tentacles. There was a good selection of meat, I recommend the lamb. The fried dough with the condensed milk for dessert was really good as well."}
{"text":"The tip is mandatory. Some servers were running around without doing anything. Food was good but the service was horrible. Will never go again."}
{"text":"This is a review on not on the food because we were not able to eat here. 

We arrived 9:45pm when the place closes at 11pm. The hostess told us they can't service us because they don't want to rush us. We told her we can eat fast and that 75 min is plenty of time. They did not want to seat us after took a Lyft 20 min to get there.

The place was less then 1/2 full so it's not like they were empty and just want to leave work early. 

Soo sad our craving for hot pot was not met. So we ended up at Seor Ak San and got some Korean soup to help fill our craving."}
{"text":"Delicious and special ayce hot pot. They have the basic food options plus a lot of selections that the other hot pot places don't carry. Been here couples of times with different friends, everyone loved it. Hidden germ is the deep fried pork slice... Just can't stop munching on those little crispy crunchiness!! One thing has to be mentioned is that... Don't wear your good clothes cause the smell is going to stay on the fabric even if you wash them."}
{"text":"Extreme friendly place and authentic Chinese Hot pot. I like the buffet style there. My friend and I agree that this is the best place in the North America."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I would go to any other million Chinese restaurant on the same street. I chose this place because of yelp reviews which was a huge mistake and I regret it so much because there are so many delicious looking places in Toronto. First, English is not proficient- so when I ordered my broth there was a misunderstanding. (Plus it was my first time) Second, it's cash or debit only which only Chinese restaurants do so they can avoid taxes. 

So when I got my broth (the spicy one when I wanted the house broth), I haven't even touched it- waiter claims I can't switch out for another one without paying for it. Which makes no sense to me- why can't they just give this broth (untouched) to another customer? He said we can't do that and you'd have to pay for another broth because that just how it works. (Again, he could not speak English fluently) 

It was downhill from there- I ordered all kinds of stuff. It's definitely not even close to a 5 star hot pot. It was edible. Do NOT try the legendary fried pork thing- I almost threw up...it's extremely spicy (not in a good way in a very spice full way) it's like eating all kinds of strong herbs in one bite. 

If your from Boston or New York or really anywhere with a decent Asian population, this broth is severely disappointing. I was hoping for shabu zen broth, but this place did not even come close.


Service wise I had to ask twice for water refill. Both my BF and i water remained empty forever. 

Total bill: $68 ridiculously not worth it for the quality of food/service.

Don't go here."}
{"text":"Decided to switch it up from our normal ayce hot pot place to try here and I was not disappointed. Our waitress was extremely friendly, helpful and attentive and definitely made the overall experience better. The food was great, everything was very fresh and they actually gave you the correct numbers of what you ordered (which not all places do!). I really like the individual pots as each person can get the broth that suits their tastes. This place was awesome and I think it's become my new go to hot pot destination"}
{"text":"Pricy. But what hot pot all-you-can-eat isn't?  Money spent here was well worth it. And trust me, I've explored numerous hot pot places left and right in New York. And they don't skimp on the ingredient options. Everything from quail egg to squid to mussels (these are normally items that come at an extra charge in addition to base price at any other place).  Service was always quick, plenty of sauce options.  Multiple times, the owner/chef himself came out to greet everyone. It was a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Clean space, good food quality and very friendly staff. There is a bit of wait during peak hours."}
{"text":"Rating this 3.5. I liked how you get your own pot. There was a limited amount of items to choose from on the menu. I wish there were more beef options or more meat in general. The lamb was really good, but eating lamb over and over was getting tiring. You get to make your own sauce at the sauce bar. The fried mantou with condensed milk for dessert was good! If you pay in cash you get small percentage off."}
{"text":"I actually loved this place a lot! If you love hot pot and you don't mind paying a bit more, you should definitely try this place. They were actually able to accommodate my party of 10. They have a big menu with many many options to choose from! Different broths, meats, and vegetables. They have individual pots for each seat, so you don't have to share with anyone. This restaurant includes a create your own sauce station. And the desserts here are AMAZING. You gotta love those fried golden buns!! And their crispy taro rolls were good too! Servers are nice and attentive. An overall 10/10 for this place."}
{"text":"It's so good! Really love the Chinese hot pot! I went to there like twice and every time when I left I was stuffed! Can u imagine how much I eat? Unbelievable! Will go there again if I can!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. Very authentic hotpot and very well priced. Food is very fresh and mean are always freshly sliced in house.

You should come if you are looking for authentic Chinese hotpot from Chongqing area. I have tried almost every hotpot in Toronto including Markham area. This place is the best when it comes to price, quality and authenticity.

I personally always get \"suicide\" and ask for more spice on top of that. In order to serve Canadians, their hotpot has been heavily diluted already, compare to the real deal in Chongqing. So honestly do not complain if you cannot even handle the mild level of their legendary pots. Your taste buds have issues, not them lol.

Edit: The one star reviewer who trashed the place for being not \"shabu zen\", obviously have not been to many hotpots, have no understanding of the cuisine and have no understanding in hygiene and financial practices in restaurants what so ever.

Restaurants do not accept credit cards because they are charged by the bank heavily for every transaction. Even using debit cards they would have to pay taxes as they are on bank record. The idiocy of some people.

It pisses me off because she/he trashed a well practiced local business like this because her/his own fuckups. What a mean spirited idiot."}
{"text":"Pretty good hot pot. There's a decent variety of meat/seafood options to choose from. There's around 3 or 4 broth options, with one spicy option and you can customize how spicy you want it. They have a small sauce bar, so you can further season your broth. I chose the mild spicy broth. There was some kind of spice in the broth that made my tongue tingle. I would suggest that you get one of the non-spicy broths and spice it yourself with the sauces in the sauce bar if you're unfamiliar with the spices used in the spicy broth.   The restaurant is AYCE, but obviously, they will charge you market price if you have too much food waste. The waiters were very helpful with explaining things to my friends who hadn't had hot pot before, and they were pretty attentive. Also, If you pay in cash, you get a small discount!"}
{"text":"Variety of food is just ok. Services is really inconsistent. We have a waitress that had no smile or \"please\" for the entire meal. Other waitress and waiters were just ok.

The worst is their food quality.

Soup base -- I had a non spicy one which wasn't impressive at all. My husband had the house special spicy one. It was salty to dead but not spicy.

Sauce -- firstly their dipping sauce ingredients are very poor, missing some key ones. Secondly, the quality of the sauce ingredient were very poor. Both my husband and I have our own \"go to sauce recipes\", which never go wrong in any hot pot restaurant. But here, the sauce just taste weird and plain

Won't come back to this place again."}
{"text":"It takes a lot to lower the experience to 1 star. The self-serve model here was most unique and interactive: I had to get up not less than three times to chase the waiter down the hall who is too busy seating customers at the door to take orders, or even bring water and napkins, which is great because I have a hustler spirit. Ordering one noodle soup from the à la carte lunch menu is indeed a monumental task so I'll give head.

Nothing would have been the same without the hot pot sauces and spices because otherwise it would not have been possible to bring the perfectly bland chongqing noodle soup back to life. The noodles were well past done and the soup tasted like boiled water with peanuts and chili oil.

Tbh though, the non-Asian gentleman who shared the table with us had a much more lavish experience, having bravely ventured hinself into the world of Chinese hot pot, left completely helpless with the nonexistent service and unsure how to deal with the various instruments. We taught him the basics and pointed him to the sauce table. At the end we turned off the hot pot element for him before the bowl burned dry. Fingers crossed that he would give Chinese hospitality a second chance in the new year.

Sorry Toronto, but this wasn't a +1 on my list of great discoveries."}
{"text":"First time trying hot pot and I liked it here :) went with some friends who knew how and what to order for hot pot and they were also impressed. Great ambiance, food, and service. Definitely recommend and would come back!"}
{"text":"IN LOVE.

This is currently my fave meal of 2016 and given how much I eat out, it's a pretty decent compliment.  

Chine is a very well-priced AYCE hot pot alternative in Chinatown.  It's a clean space, and everyone gets their own hot pot with choice of broth ($3-4 each) - be warned, suicide and killer are LEGIT spicy. Once broth is picked, the pigging out can begin.  Everything is done via an order sheet (similar to dim sum places and AYCE sushi) and you get two rounds - so no need to go super crazy the first time!  You also get to make your own sauce at a station so tweak to your liking using seafood sauce, hot sauce, sesame paste and much more.

The variety of food here is great, you have your typical beef, lamb slices (and there are several variations), as well as seafood (octopus, shrimp, mussles etc.), veggies (spinach, watercress, etc.), carbs (vermicelli, udon, etc.).  In addition, they have a few great desserts such as the golden fried bun dipped in condensed milk.  Pure deliciousness.  The thing that put Chine at a solid five stars for me is the lovely service - everyone was super friendly and made some solid recommendations.  As well, when our first order was not processed through due to a technical glitch, we received both several apologies and immediate action to ensure our food came out in the next couple minutes.  Water/tea and soup broth was refilled constantly without asking.

I walked out prob several lbs heavier from this meal (but definitely zero regrets).  

Note: on a weekend evening Chine was very busy so if you have a smaller group, you may need to share a table with other groups to curb the wait.  Chine also accepts reservations for groups of 6 or more."}
{"text":"A modern clean looking hotpot resto located in the heart of china town (Spadina and north of dundas). I've been to this location twice and both times was a great experience! Interior of the resto is super nice with marble tables and comfy chairs. Each seat has their own stove top and you get served your own mini pot. Not a lot of soup base to choose from, but their basic chicken and pork broth is not overly salty and quite tasty with mushrooms and squash. Their AYCE menu is quite huge with a good amount of different stuff to choose from. Their meats looked quite fresh and they have a good selection of seafood option (Shrimp, mussels, fish, cuttle fish, squid) Veggie selection is also good. A fav of ours is their lobster ball. They're so GOOD when cooked! They also have a section catered specifically to mushrooms... which was a little odd to see on the AYCE menu since usually it only includes meats, veggie, dumplings and frozen items. They also have a dessert selection in their menu which included this deep dried taro pastry and deepfried buns in condense milk. so good!!!

Service has always been super friendly as well. They have the AYCE hotpot option at lunch too so if you are craving hotpot on a cold cold day, they are open from 11 am onwards (unlike moral on dundas) It is a little pricey, with tips and tax it comes up to about 32$ but if you pay with cash you get a 5% discount! 

Will definitely be returning especially when winter gets super cold!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time.  Our waitress was wonderful.  Food was amazing went with medium spicy broth it was delicious would not recommend super spicy.  We were so full after 1st round that we could not go onto the 2nd round.  Will come back when we come back to visit."}
{"text":"I came to Toronto for a vacation, and I had my very first hotpot at this restaurant.  It was Sunday afternoon around 4pm, so there were not many people.   This place is spacious and clean.   The waiter was super attentive and friendly, and he helped us from step one throughout the whole meal. (Since it was our first hotpot experience, we could use some guidance)  I like spicy food, so I wanted to try the hot broth. There are three levels of the hot broth; mild, suicide, killer spicy. I chose suicide level, and it has good flavor and numbness but as a spicy loving person, I should have ordered killer spicy.  Later I learned we could have asked for more paste for spicier broth if you want more kick. We tried all the meat, veggies and other selections they have, and my favorite was sliced beef, watercress, bean curd, and vermicelli. They also have a good sauce corner, lots to choose from.  It was overall a very fun and fulfilling experience.  We loved it and want to go back again.  It is also pretty close from the Art Gallery of Ontario, and I strongly recommend going to AGO, and then visit this place as we did, and you will not regret it."}
{"text":"My husband was shopping for vinyl along Spadina and because of the frigid weather, we decided to hop into a hotpot place for dinner.

First impressions: The decor is quite chic for a hotpot place.  The dining area and bathrooms were quite clean.  The staff is friendly and helpful. Quiet at first, but t got quite loud after an hour into our meal.

Food: I've always had hotpot communal-style; however, Chine offers individual pots for each person.  I tried the black chicken broth while my husband tried their mild Legendary broth (to eh uh he found to be quite salty -- and he loves his sodium).  I thought the black chicken broth was quite nice -- the flavours were strong enough that when they topped up my pot with hot water, it was still quite flavourful.  Note: The staff does ask if you want to top up your pot with broth -- beware: there is an additional cost for the top up -- if you want to avoid this, just ask for hot water.  The broth will still taste great with water added to it.

The quality of the food was pretty good -- especially the beef.  I loved their deep fried golden bread with condensed milk -- but other than that, nothing really stands out.  Moreover, I thought for the price (+$ for weekend and broth), the selection of food is quite limited.  The sauce stand was okay -- there were sauces that I would've liked to see, but was nowhere to be found.

Overall, was it a fun experience? Definitely! Worth the price? We didn't leave feeling like we were taken for.  

3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty decent hot pot place. The ingredients are very fresh and a step up from other hot pot places. However, I did not really like their broth. You gotta pay extra for the broth, which sucks since other places usually have free broth included.

I got the black chicken broth which was OK, the ginseng taste was too strong and kinda overpowers the ingredients, also the chicken was cut really small and I got a lot of small bones in my soup. Soup was also overly salty and I kept reaching for water.

However, I will give them kudos for their fried mantou/taro rolls with condensed milk. Those were the bomb! Will I come here again? Probably won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I think it's the best hot pot place in downtown Toronto. 

For around $30/ person you get a good hot pot experience. 

I find the make your own sauce station pretty cool as you get to customize it to personal preference. I'm a \"sauce\" person so this was a bit of heaven for me (made like four different types of sauce every visit). The menu was diverse and had all the typical hot pot items. I really enjoyed the dumplings. For dessert try the fried puns with condensed milk- it was nice finish to the meal. Also, try the plum juice it was not too sweet and a perfect accompaniment!

The restaurant atmosphere itself is nothing too special, it is like most other hot pot places. 

However, if you do not speak Mandarin it may be hard to communicate with the servers. They only take debit and cash."}
{"text":"Where do I being? A great selection of foods ranging from land animals, sea animals and plants. On top of there are many soup bases. I had the suicide broth and boy was it spicy. It made a lot of use of the peppercorn which gave it a nice numbing. Couple that with the spiciness and we have a great marriage of numbing and spice. The service was nice, our waitress was very attentive. Food came out at a reasonable pace considering that the entire restaurant was full. 

BUT THE OWNER WAS THE BEST. He was so down to earth with my friends and I. He would always come to us and make sure we're happy, he would encourage us to order more and he just really made us feel at home.

TLDR; Nice quality foods, nice variety, nice service and amazing owner"}
{"text":"Great hot pot place, clean and delis!!!"}
{"text":"AYCE just never screams quality for me, and so I tend to shy away from those types of restaurants. Chine, however, is one of the few exceptions I will make.

Unlike other hotpot restaurants, you will be cooking food in your very own pot, perfect for germaphobes and picky eaters like myself. I have tried a number of broths, but I will say my top 2 would have to be the Special Tomato Broth, and the Creamy Corn and Sweet Potato broth.

Upon ordering, I love to put together a concoction of dipping sauces from their selection. Tip: sesame paste and sesame oil is not only delicious but it also helps to cool your tongue!

Sliced lamb and beef is perhaps our go-to, no frills protein, we don't order anything else as they are wonderful on their own. Other dishes we would order include (from most to less frequently): watercress, udon noodle, quail eggs, fish balls, lotus slices, and sweet potatoes.

The dessert selection here is pretty great. I LOVE the fried Chinese buns, served with condensed milk to dip.

One thing I will say about this place is that getting the attention of a server is a struggle. Also, the food coma hits like brick wall."}
{"text":"Gonna make this quick because I don't have any issues at all.  Basically this place is pretty damn good, nice atmosphere, good food and all you can eat.  
Quality of food is pretty good, I don't remember what I ordered because I just marked one of everything then see which one is good then re-order.  That is what I would recommend because what I like may not be what you like so being that eat plate is a few pieces that is your chance of trying everything then order what you like out of them all.

One very important thing, come here more then 2hr before they close.  Why?  It generally takes you 2 hrs to eat Hot-pot so they will not accept you if you come less then the 2hrs before closing."}
{"text":"It was aiight. The sauce bar was kind of sad and everything was out in the open (sauces were not covered), and honest-to-god, if you're going to have a sauce bar, don't put it near the entrance. It's hot, flies are coming in, bowls are uncovered, and servers aren't gonna know if the bowls are empty if it's that far out (when there's no more satay sauce :c). 

Decent selection of meats, veggies, and misc - and I actually loved the broth! Got a standard spicy broth, and if you're a spice-junkie like me, I'd still recommend sticking with mild at first - you can always add more spice later. Service was quick and standard for a Chinese hot pot place. But they should relocate the sauce bar and put a cover on them."}
{"text":"Typical hotpot place in Chinatown. However, Chine's AYCE only allows you to order 2 rounds. And each time, they will give you less than what you ordered. For example, in round 1, we ordered 4 servings of enoki mushrooms and only 2 tiny bunches came. Round 2, we decided to order 6 servings and only 3 bunches came - not enough for 4 of us to share. It then became a running joke throughout our dinner to see how 10 orders of tofu puffs (2/order) = only 6 puffs, 5 orders of beef is exactly the same as 10 orders, etc. I don't eat meat, but my carnivore friends did say the meat quality was quite decent (compared to some other hotpot locations in Chinatown). I personally, found that their veggie selection paled in comparison to other places. Also, their sauce bar was limited and didn't offer any eggs (I like raw eggs in my soy sauce mixture - yes I like to risk salmonella lol). I ended up with a tummy ache after this dinner so needless to say, I won't be coming back.

EDIT: the owner of Chine has since messaged me and told me that they actually take more than 2 rounds of orders but it's printed on the ordering sheet that way in order to save paper. Raw eggs can also be provided if you ask the staff. (This info would have been nice to know at the beginning if the servers gave brief intros on how the system works)"}
{"text":"Chine is a clean, spacious restaurant for hot pot with solid fresh ingredients.

I came to Chine for lunch as I've been burned a couple of times by the inconsistent opening hours of their popular competitor, Celebrity Hot Pot.  Apparently Chine is a huge chain from China, which I wasn't aware of initially.

Like other hot pot restaurants, this place is all you can eat.  You're given a sheet of paper and you just check off what you like.

There's a few options for broth. I tasted the \"legendary\" spicy broth (mild) and the corn and taro broth.  The former, even though it's mild, has quite the kick.  The spiciness intensifies as the broth boils off.  It's perfect for those who like the tongue-numbing action of Szechuan peppercorn.  The corn and taro broth, on the other hand, was inoffensive.

There's a decent selection of sauces to choose from.  My only comparison is Celebrity Hot Pot which has more peanut and sesame-based options.  Nevertheless, there's still a decent number of sauces though no raw eggs.

The menu's pretty extensive with some interesting pre-marinated options for meat.  Granted, when the food comes, you're quickly overwhelmed by what's on your table, it's hard to keep track of what's what.

Service was good.  I never had to ask for my broth to be re-filled and food came out promptly.  There were a few items that we ordered that never came, but the 95% of what we ordered arrived.

Finally, two negatives: 
1) there's no drink fountain but it wasn't a big deal for me.  You can still get water or tea at your table

2) my slight raw meat germ phobia wishes there were separate tongs for cooking, though you can always ask for an extra pair of chopsticks."}
{"text":"I love all the broths at this place especially the creamy corn & potato and the herbal chicken broth. The flavor is on point so the meat and veggies we add in enhance it even more. I also love how everyone get their own little pot, think I can sit here and eat for hours because all the ingredients are so fresh and it's definitely worth the money! I really like that cookie thing they give you for dessert as well - everything was so yummy here!"}
{"text":"Chine is a individual style hot pot restaurant that unique compare to original hot pot style in Chinatown. It looks modern, simple and clean with the okay service. No compliment drinks like plum tea or soy milk but they have deep fried sweet rolls for desert. Chine legendary fried pork is a must try !"}
{"text":"It is really nice. I think it's even better than MOrale village. I like it. Staff were very nice. Had a great time there. The seafood sauce was very delicious. The location is in the heart of Chinatown"}
{"text":"D and I was walking by looking for a place for dinner and decided to give this place a try as it was new in China town. It was already really busy, but as we were two people, we got lucky and there was space for us. I have to say the decor in this place is much newer and modern compared to other Chinese hot pot places. However, it was extremely crowded. I felt very claustrophobic. First off, you each get an individual hot pot, so there is not much space on the table. Second, the seating although is okay, it is not very comfortable because to compensate for the lack of table space under your table there is a metal shelf to put all dishes that you can't fit on your table. Thirdly, the service is not very good - especially when they keep speaking to me in Mandarin when I keep using English with them. I mean, if I am able to converse in Mandarin I wouldn't be using English with them in the first place, right *sarcasm*.... 
The all you can eat menu, there are a lot of items to choose from, which is good. But your soup for your hot pot, is extra cost on top of the all you can eat price per person. Compared to other hot pot places I would say this place cost a bit more. However, I don't think I would come here any time soon - I really don't like the fact that you have to pay cash and the servers continue to speak to me in a language that I don't understand even when I am paying for my bill."}
{"text":"The service there was really good. Our waitress was super enthused about telling us about how the hot pot works and explaining about the different dishes being offered.  
We each got our own soup pot which is really nice!  You can choose from a selection of different broths.  The hot pot selection was huge.  The soup sauce Bar was great!  I went back up a few times to try out different sauce mixes.  
It was a hot summer day when we went here.  But the air conditioning inside was quite nice.  I was concerned that it would be too damp inside and it wasn't.  The place was very nice and clean.  We took our time as we wanted to catch up and the waitress was pretty chill and let us enjoy our time there without rushing us - which is the case for most AYCE places.  I'd come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"One advice is to make sure you call ahead to book a table. I knew about this place from reviews and wanted to try them out. When my friends wanted to go for hot pot, I suggested them to come downtown and try this place instead of going to the one they originally wanted to try in Markham.

Quickly, I called up the place to reserve a table with 7 of us. We were going late around 8 pm so it was the last round of customers for the night. Mind you that it was a Friday and I was hopeful that I would be lucky to get a table. When we arrived, there were lots of others waiting and we were quickly seated after telling them we had a reservation. Once there, we were looking at the menu and trying to figure things out. Keep in mind that they charge extra for all broth and drinks are pay as you go. Weekends 

The experience was great as the wait staff and owner would check up on us plus explain the options. There is a 2 hour seating limit but with the last round of the day, we continued to eat passed the deadline. We are definitely going back and hopefully, they have some new items on the menu soon."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of hot pot in my life all over Canada and the world. This one was a huge let down.

The spicy broth is lethal even at the mildest level, so I would recommend a cleaner broth.  

Freshness-wise, not bad. Ventilation is really bad so if you're going in on a hot day, prepare to suffer as there are no overhead vents or air conditioning: the sauce selection is decent but a lot of it isn't fresh. A lot is pre-chopped and packaged. The satay sauce is also a bit off."}
{"text":"The food was OK.  The service seem very inattentive especially  considering  my group was sitting at the back directly in front kitchen area.  The portions of seafood brought to us were very small.  The reason why my group went was to try hot pot with individual cooking pots.  It's pricey, can still fill yourself up since it's  \"AYCE\".  The staff brings you the ingredients which was heavy with beef/chicken/pork but don't expect much seafood."}
{"text":"We decided to visit Chine Hot Pot & Noodles on a weekend night for a second try and this time, we had a quite pleasant experience. We did not bump into any of the previous issues mentioned, no fruit flies were spotted, the meat was fresh (nice large thin slices of lamb and beef that were not falling apart like at some other hotpot restaurants) and the service was by far one of the best in Chinatown. The waiters were super attentive to every single table checking in on them every so often and our food came by very fast.

Out of all their soups, my favourite would definitely be the black chicken one and the mild version of their home soup."}
{"text":"The hot pot tastes ok. But the service is horrible! We visited about 5pm on Friday. The waiter arranged us to a table close to the entrance, when there were plenty vacant tables inside. Wind blew in every time new customers came in, so we requested to change table. The waiter cautioned: because today is Friday, you must share the table with others. He spoke in a tone that made us uncomfortable. They also missed our orders! when we ordered 4 pieces, they just gave us 1 or 2. Later, a rude lady came to clean up the plate. She forced us to take the remaining 2 fish balls by dropping the fish balls in our pot. It was hot, and the soup splashed out and burned my friend. When we checked, the waiter asked cash or card. He said we got discount if we pay cash. Ok. He then said he would bring the bills. But after 10 minutes, no bill was brought. The same rude lady just yelled at us, you must pay at the counters. We don't bring bills. WT F! If you prefer not to be humiliated like us, go to ?? or Mongolian hot pot. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"All you can eat hot pot. Need I say more? Service is very attentive as they always come as ask if we need broth refills."}
{"text":"Before I talk about the food here, I should mention that the owner here was VERY helpful. He was the only one who could communicate in English there.If I am eating at somewhere knowing that the owner is this attentive and nice to customers, I will certainly trust the quality of food too (here the freshness of the ingredients as they don't really cook stuff). 

I didn't mean that other staffs were rude or anything. They all seemed like International students who can't speak English that much (they just didn't understand us even when we were asking simple questions). They were just not well-trained, clumsy and blunt about stuff. At least the owner made up for it! 

We came here just before 6pm for dinner on Friday, and it was already packed when we got there. They didn't miss a single order unlike other ayce places. You get an individual pot and choose your own broth (there are about 6 options to choose from). You do have to pay extra for the broth, but they refill the broth if it gets too reduced while you are eating. We could tell the ingredients were very fresh (meat, seafood, veggies, just everything). If you have fresh ingredients, customized sauce, and good broth, your hot pot experience can't really go wrong. We loved their taro rolls (dessert)!!!!!!! We had like 4 each, not kidding. 

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone! Just like any other hot pot places though, you will smell like hot pot until you take a shower haha. But it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"3.5/5

Cine is a nice new minimalistic modern looking ayce hotpot restaurant with spacious semi communal tables that forces you to share it with other costumers if you come in with small group. It can make you feel uncomfortable about sharing table with others. I wish they have some sort of thin heavy table divider to actually divide the table to prevent mixing ingredients with other  group's order.

They have good selection of broths available. My personal favorite broths are black chicken broth and sichuan style spicy broth. They are not as authentic as I wish to be but it's perfect for ppl who are new to hotpot. 

Unfortunately they do not offer Yin Yang style hotpot. So you will have to order two separate broths if you want two different kinds. On the other hand, their individual pot is pretty deep so it allows you to enjoy your hotpot without constantly bothering servers for more broth.

They have all the standard ingredients available on the menu and they are pretty fresh. Their New Zealand lamb was definitely the best quality one that I had from hotpot places.

Big plus for make your own dipping sauce station and relatively fast service.

I will definitely go back when I'm in dt and crave hotpot."}

AYCE hotpot restaurant located near Chinatown. There's a dipping sauce station near the doors where you make/mix your own sauce. The restaurant itself is quite cramped and if you come during dinner, you will probably need to share a table. Space is super limited, so the plates of food will start to pile up after a while! Quality of the food is definitely better than most other ayce hotpot restaurants though, so that's a plus. You get at most 3 rounds of food, which is usually enough and in my opinion, their lamb was the best. Service can be a bit spotty, and they only accept debit or cash. Prices are higher than most other hotpot places, but their quality of food makes up for that difference."}
{"text":"The hotpot here was excellent. We each get our own pot and food promptly arrives. I went with the mild legendary broth and it was abit more spicy than normal mild but I like spicy do I didn't complain

You get maximum of 3 rounds or 2 hours sitting which is more than a typical person can eat. We sat and talked awhile and ended up staying past 3 hours which I liked because they didn't rush us however it was end of day. 

The food was not as fresh or tasty as some of the better hotpot places. The sauces were running low and they didn't top up; however the hotpot was still very good."}
{"text":"This is THE place to be for hot pot. Great food, great service and decent price for all you can eat. Not a spicy eater, i still enjoyed the non-spicy soup base. Perfect pick-me-up for a cold ass day. Would recommend getting the beef and lamb slices, beef meatball and tofu."}
{"text":"It costs $30.x includes soup base & tax before tip for a weekday dinner. Deep fried buns are really good and the meat is fresh."}
{"text":"My family and I dined at Chine Hot Pot and Noodles. It was packed Sunday night. Each of us got our own personalized hot pot with our own choice of broths - Legendary Spicy Broth, Black Chicken Broth, Variety Mushroom Broth, and Pork & Chicken Broth. 

I ordered the Black Chicken Broth which consisted of black Chicken, ginger and gojiberries. 

The order form was rather confusing. Since this is an all you can eat style hot pot restaurant for a set price, they allows you to order up to three rounds of 
meat, vegetables, and starches, one round at a time. 

For meats, we ordered the following: 
-Two Orders of Special Beef Slice
-Two Orders of Superior Beef Slice
-One Order of Chicken
-One Order of Fish Fillet
-One Order of Squid Tenacle
-One Order of Beef Ball
-One Order of Lobster Ball
-One Order Fish Ball

For vegetables, we ordered the following:
-Fresh Tofu
-Spinach 
-Watercress
-Cabbage
-Sweet Corn
-Enoki Mushrooms
-Shiitake Mushroom 

For starches, we ordered the following:
-Udon Noodle
-Ramen Noodle
-Rice Vermicelli
-Chicken and Cabbage Dumplings
-Pork Wontons

After placing our order, we went to the condiments bar to make our own sauces. My sauce consisted of 
Soy Sauce, Vinegar, Mashed Garlic, Green Onion, and Parsley.

Luckily, we didn't have leftovers - they would have charged 20% of the final bill. It was just enough food for four hungry mouths. 

We were surprised that they didn't have a liquor license but were satisfied with soft drinks - Ginger Ale and Nestea.

We ended our meal with sweets - an order of Crispy Taro Rolls and an order of Crispy Bread, which came with a Creamy Coconut Paste. The Crispy Taro Roll consisted of fried dough stuffed with mashed taro. The taro was fragrant. The Crispy Bread reminded me of a deep fried mantou. Both were delicious choices!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was horrible. The store is supposed to be closed at 11:00pm, however, the waiter lied that they close at 10:30pm. Moreover, they asked for last call at 9:00pm. By 9:30pm, all the chairs were on the tables, and they appeared to be ready to close once we leave.."}
{"text":"What a shit show.   20 min wait turned into a 1 hour wait! Then we sit and they didn't get our soup order right, and started giving us attitude about our actual order ! (We actually ordered in Chinese to our server)

When the plates started to arrive - it was mayhem.  All the plates arrived at the same time and our bowls hadn't even begun to boil.  

The staff are relegated to squeezing by back counter and back corner table- making it an awkward trip with hot bowls of liquids.  It's an accident waiting to happen! 

Overall, my hotpot experience wasn't too bad. I don't think I will be back to this location though.  It's too hectic and fast paced for my liking."}
{"text":"Came to dinner here last Saturday for a friend's birthday! Very excellent experience!! I've been to a few hot pot places but this is by far my favourite to date! I like how we all receive our own individual broth pots and they have a good selection from broths to chose from!
All food to cook was excellent! And very prompt after ordering!"}
{"text":"Hot pot is definitely my favorite food for winter!
As an all-you-can-eat hot pot place, Chine is quite reasonably priced. The selection of food is not the most extensive, but has the majority of my favorites. Chine can get quite busy sometimes, and they don't take reservations during weekend dinners. But we were told that they were generally less busy a bit later into the evening.

The set up is individual small pots that I quite liked. No need to fight over whose food it is in the pot. lol! It also feels more spacious, probably due to the high ceilings.

Overall a great place to enjoy hot pot!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The price is comparable to other hot pot places nearby like Morals Village or Little Sheep Mongolian hot pot, but the ingredients are fresher. Everything, from the meat to the veggies and seafood, tastes better and is fresher than at other places. My wife says this is the best hot pot place in Toronto, and I agree--Of course, I always agree with her about anything... That's a free marriage tip guys!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a big group. Awesome food and the service was even better! Everything was fresh and the taro rolls for desert were great. I would recommend this place for groups between 1-8. Make sure if you get the spicy broth not to go for the suicide or killer, unless you have the stomach for it!"}
{"text":"Ordered 10 shrimps, 4 were brought to our table. Similar for other items as well. Service is just ok. Not the best hotpot."}
{"text":"This is probably the fanciest AYCE hot pot option that I've tried in downtown Toronto. Food and service were good. It's a little more expensive than Celebrity or Little Sheep."}
{"text":"Visiting  Toronto from the states.  The food was great and fresh.  Our waitress was awesome. she was really helpfull and caring. The place was clean and had a contemporary feel. It was good price. You wont regret it. Went on a Monday"}
{"text":"This was a very satisfying downtown hotpot experience. Very authentic -- similar in many ways to what Ive had in Chengdu and Chongqing (we opted for the classic spicy hotpot).  A real plus is the condiment area, separate from the table, with an array of other oils, spices and garnishes.  Another plus is that once your hotpot is ordered, everything else is limitless, so essentially it's all you can eat (this also explains the price tag which, admittedly, is a bit on the steep side for what you are actually getting).  We loved the lamb, liver, beef, noodles, tofu, and squid.  I wish there had been duck blood, but I suspect that the municipal health authorities wont allow that."}
{"text":"I've been to Chine twice before for AYCE hot pot, and both times was very impressed. Although busy, service was excellent and the food came out promptly. I did not have to wait for a table. The decor is modern and the restaurant seems recently renovated or new. They have individual pots which I prefer to group hot pot. Of note, the mild broth is much hotter than you would expect (however, the waitstaff warned us before ordering so no complaints here). I have tried the mushroom broth and the creamy sweet potato and corn broth. Both are very good if you prefer something without spice. The food selection is quite extensive, however they could have more vegetables to choose from. I wouldn't recommend eating here if you're a vegetarian as there isn't as much choice for non-meat options. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm not an avid hot pot consumer, mostly because I have the appetite of a small bird and I can never eat enough for AYCE. Chine hot pot is still a nice restaurant to consider, especially if you're with a big group of people.

It's nestled in Chinatown and really stands out with their beautiful marble countertops and gilded wall decor. Soup base costs $2-$3, and you can order two rounds of food ranging from meat to veggies. The portions are quite generous in size, and the waiters don't bother you but are quick to refill water. You pay at the front when you're done!

Overall, as a party of three, we had a lovely time chatting and eating in Chine restaurant. On a weekend night, it wasn't terribly busy or loud, and when we're done eating we could go out to get some dessert. 

Favorites: lamb slices!"}
{"text":"Came to Toronto for a few days to explore (but mainly to eat) and hot pot was one of the first things in our checklist. Long story short, this place left a bitter taste in my mouth (literally).

Walked in with a group of 7 and were seated very tightly in a couch area when we easily could have sat in the round tables. This made for a VERY uncomfortable meal. Minus half a star.

We began ordering, but before we did, we had to order the Broth which was not a problem. I opted for the mild legendary spicy broth. I warn you, that the spicy broth isn't spicy because of the broth but because of the damned chiles and those weird balls on the bottom. I personally wasn't familiar with this because I've never had hotpot before (I know, right?) but being asian, I guess it was as if I would have been used to this? No one told me that if I ate the little balls with the chile on the bottom (which, apparently you're NOT suppose to?) that my entire mouth would become numb for several minutes. I ended up scooping out all the chile and the things on the bottom and diluted the crap out of it with water. So.. long story short; maybe opt for the broths that are NOT labeled the \"Legendary spice\" even if it says mild. 

The food was very good. The vegetables, the meat, especially the lamb, beef and pork were delicious. The shrimp was fresh and juicy, I loved it all. The only thing that bothered me the most was the lack of attention to my table. My group and I were low on broth at least 2-3 times while we were there for 2 hours and never did a worker come by to pour more broth. I, was flabbergasted by the horrible service because we had to flag down waiters multiple times and they said \"it's coming\" and we proceeded to wait at least 15+ mins, while they checked their phones. Minus 1/2.

Another thing is that the workers failed to get our order and had forgotten it twice?? Like.. how? I mean, we gave them the slip with everything on it, but just had forgot to put it in.. twice. It took so much effort from my group to get at least decent service.. So this was a full star off.

The only thing that saves this place is the food. I really enjoyed everything that we ate and I hope that this was a one time thing so that if we ever come back, maybe the service will be better."}
{"text":"Was served all you can eat only menu, but they have the regular menu. I may still choose to have buffet style but it does not feel good knowing it at the end.

Many choices, I would not say a lot, but enough. You get the \"essentials\" for hot pot.

Ingredients are generally fresh and good. The fried taro and deep fried pork was something I don't like. The sauce station quickly ran out of some items and they were a bit slow to fill them. For all you can eat, 30 CAD is what you pay. Even with this style, you still have to pay for your broth. This looks weird to me.

Decor is decent and bright. You have to ask for napkin (they offer tissue). 

I didn't have sky milk and it was on my bill, but they quickly fixed it. 

All in all, good place to have hot pot."}
{"text":"Great food, clean place, good service. 

Servers were very polite and attentive though it was quite busy. They offered to explain how it works, made sure to refill our waters regularly, and were apologetic whenever there was a slight delay (due to the number of customers). 

Lamb and beef were tasty. Spicy beef was surprisingly good. Vegetables looked fresh. I also enjoyed their seafood options (mussels, large shrimp, octopus). Orders are shared but pots are individual. Very good, though they should really supply extra sets of chopsticks for handling raw. Had to ask them for it. Also, the ladles were offered later. Really should just have it out at the beginning. 

Ordering was very easy. Form is straight forward. Some items have number of pieces, others are just by plate. Do tell them what you want on re-orders and it'll come out quickly. 

Spicy broth is very spicy. Tastes great, but next time I'll try their tomato or chicken. 

Sauce station was awesome. So many choices including mashed garlic! Again the area was clean. 

I only wish their drink selection was better. Soy milk wasn't available. Even if it was, it would be an extra $3. No beer either. 

Still, I prefer this to the dirty celebrity hot pot and the older little sheep. Just AYCE weekend price plus broth came to $35 after tax n tip. 

My guests tried hot pot for the first time and enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"This is my third time visiting this place for hotpot and it doesn't disappoint. This place is good for casual dates and for group outings. It's not too loud, the lighting is bright, and there are large round tables for larger groups, where each person still gets their own little pot to boil things. 

Since we were a group of 5, we sat in one of the booths in the back. The all you can eat is priced at $23.99/person on weekday night and you have to pay for the soup base separately which is another $2.5-3. This price is comparable with Morals Village, both on the pricier side but Morals Village is more nicely renovated. I picked the black chicken broth but honestly I couldn't really taste the difference other than the bits of black chicken skin at the bottom of the pot. 

All the ordering is done on a sheet of paper, you write down the quantity of each item you want and they get delivered to your table. All the meats, shrimps and veggies are very fresh. The sweet potato noodles here are super thick, which is the best kind! Also, word of caution: cool the quail eggs completely before putting it in your mouth. I hardly ever wait long enough and suffered the consequences many times. Another thing that was different about this place was their fermented bean curd sauce for dipping. It actually contained squares of the bean curd, which I preferred over the blended version in other places.

The servers didn't speak perfect English but service is really quick and they are pretty attentive. They also didn't mind us sitting there talking till closing time, probably because the place was fairly empty on this Wednesday night. There is a slight cash discount which is always good.

Compared to Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, they had better meat selections and some unique chef's recommendation items. But price wise, this place is a bit more expensive, so it really depends on your preference. Happy hot potting!"}
{"text":"Pros: Each person gets their own pot. Wide food selection.
Cons: Too much MSG. They charge extra for your soup base...shouldn't that be part of the AYCE price?? It's hotpot you need soup makes no sense to charge extra for the water in the pot."}
{"text":"This is a all you can eat restaurant, and it is a nice restaurant because they are not only offer all you can eat but special lunch for work days! The price for all you cut it is very reasonable. Foods are fresh, also have a good service. Over all really nice! Worthy to try and try the second time!"}
{"text":"Very unpleasant experience. The schedule on the front door claims that they close at 11pm on weekdays, but when we got there they told us that we had to leave at 10:30. We got there at 9:30 and we had to wait for 3 more friends at that moment. We told the waiter we were gonna wait for some people before we order and he said okay. However, the waiter came back every 2 minutes to rush the order and we got super annoyed and told him to stop. AND HE CAME BACK AGAIN. AND AGAIN! When our friends finally arrived, the waiter told us that we can only order one round of food when it is an all you can eat buffet!  Honestly, I was so pissed, I would've just left if it wasn't for my friends."}
{"text":"Authentic Asian food!! Great favor!  Nice to have individual hot pots.  Stay away from the \"Killer\" broth!  It is too hot!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. We made reservations for a group of 6 for a Saturday night. Picked up the crew headed down to ChinaTown from Markham. The hostess simply said, \"no we never received the reservation and that we were best off to try the hotpot next door.\" No apology given. Smirk on her face. Great customer service! If you make reservations. Make sure you call and confirm your booking the following day. Apparently reservations are not guaranteed. Great policy"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I have always wanted to try a real Chinese hot pot but have been afraid to. I could not have picked a better place to try out a hot pot! The staff was kind and helpful, they made sure I ordered a wide range of deliciousness!

It felt like I ordered everything on the menu but once I started try stuff it didn't matter. Everything had a great and interesting taste.

Take the chance! Stop by and experience it! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE

This is a great place for hotpot. There is a choice of broth ranging from mild to spicy to suicide. We took a spicy broth and got a side of spice in case we needed to spice it up. Worked well for us. The meats were ranging from pork, beef and lamb. The seafood was an assortment of shrimp, fish fillets and calamari. The lobster balls were not good. The greens were great. The corn was excellent..You can order all you can eat twice over. Not bad. Great value for money and all this with attentive service. The place is clean and we'll maintained..

It's a great experience. Not much for vegetarians or folks who don't have red meat/pork....keep that it mind."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last night.  Very pleasantly surprised.  Almost a full house, place was relatively clean and the food quality was quite good.  Would repeat and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I liked how this place has its own sauce station. We were getting really creative with ours. But if you're not good at creating your own sauce, they have sauce recipes for you to follow. I also liked how you each get your own individual pot. Great for those who dislike the seafood taste in the broth, like myself. The only downfall for me is that there wasn't as much of a meat selection. I felt like they were the same meat but prepped differently. Other than that this was a good experience."}
{"text":"We heard this place was a must eat, it's not that I didn't like it, but I was expecting something truly amazing. It's just your topical all you can eat. The servers are patient and friendly considering the mayhem in the restaurant. They brought stuff and forgot stuff we've had order but considering it's all you can eat it's something easily overlookable. At 31$ per person I personally think it's a bit over priced."}
{"text":"My friends and I were told that we had to try the hot pot in Toronto, so I found Chine Hot Pot, an all you can eat hot pot in Chinatown. The unique element about this hot pot is the variety of broths* you can choose from. I had the legendary spicy broth which has a scale of spicy levels (half mild, mild, suicide) and my friend ordered the mushroom broth. Each broth also has it's own price that's added on top of the all you can eat. I give Chine 4 stars because they would forget to bring out a dish we requested or bring out the incorrect quantity. Aside from that, the servers were warm and welcoming; music was playing (from top 40 hits to Chinese music); and the menu offered a breadth of options.

*Note that the sweet corn broth is pork based 
**Cash or Canadian credit only."}
{"text":"the broths are nice and there are lots of choices of ingredients for cooking.

service is friendly. the place gets busy though and service does suffer a bit then.

the place is clean for Chinatown.

p.s.: I think they use msg in their broths."}
{"text":"Best hot pot I have ever had. Our family of five had a great dinner at Chine Hot Pot. We often go out for hot pot in Boston and this restaurant is so much better than we are used to. A couple of things made it so special. Individual pots for each person. Very clean. Prime meats and vegetables. An incredible selection of sauces. Great service."}
{"text":"Better than Morals Village!

Reservation
- You can put your name down and the system is quite efficient. Chine sends you a link where you can see what position you're in. Hop over to Coco's for some pre-hot pot bubble tea just up the street.
- At Morals, you can make a reso for 6+ people. Otherwise, you have to wait around for your number to be called (we stood by the front of the restaurant for an hour)

Price 
- Chine is less expensive, but not by a significant amount (a couple dollars)

Ambiance
- More spacious but less \"hipster chic\" compared to Morals 
- If you're a group of 2, you might have to share a table with another group of 2

Food 
- You're allowed to order 3 rounds via paper
- The staff puts your order in through their phone compared to Morals where you tell your order to the staff
- We got all the times we ordered whereas at Morals, we were practically pleading for a plate of meat
- Less soup bases and variety to choose from compared to Morals... but it's more than enough for you to eat

This place is now my go to hotpot place in Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Chine hot pot is clean, modern and most of all delicious! We had a party of 3 and decided to check it out. The only drawback was the lineup - which is to be expected when dining at peak hours.

Pros: freshly sliced meats, a huge variety of food on the menu, excellent soup bases that you can't find at other hot pot places (our favourite was the \"black chick\" - a rich, herby broth that is 10x better than your average chicken broth)

Cons: service was a bit slow (very busy restaurant) so we missed receiving some of our items, their english fluency is about a 7/10, as most staff are mandarin speaking

Overall: the best hot pot in chinatown in my opinion and definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I was in Chinatown with my boyfriend yesterday and we decided to eat here because he was shocked that I've never tried hot pot. As soon as we walked into the store we were immediately seated and started ordering. 

Ordering out food with the \"first\" and \"second\" round was kind of confusing, and when we asked the waiter about it, it seemed though their English wasn't very good. That was fine since my boyfriend is Chinese and was able to communicate with the waiter. We got our soup bases and our  food pretty quickly. 

Overall it was a pretty good experience and the decorations are nice and simple. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great to be back. This time we tried their dinner service. We were able to grab a table for four rather quickly. 

The host at the front was very polite. The overall vibe here is chill and unhurried with high ceilings, minimalist decor and traditional Chinese touches setting the mood. Many hot pot places in GTA can be cramped or steamy but through the magic of custom made exhaust vents and soundproofing, Chine successfully defies this convention. 

I tried the Suicide Spicy Broth.  I honestly thought it was going to taste peppery and tasteless, boy was I glad to be wrong. It was quite nice and full of flavour. The taste brings me back to Chongqing. Oh yeah, it was great to see that Chine has leek sauce, not a lot of hot pot places have this kind of sauce. 

Must try their thick fatty cuts of beef and Spiced Beef covered in Chinese five spice. Deeeeelicious!!!  Lots of flavour and texture, and I really appreciate the strong meaty taste. Screaming Chili Beef was wonderful; tender beef wrapped around a whole jalapeño. Try cooking this in any spicy broth and eating it. You won't be disappointed. 

We end the night by ordering Golden Chinese Bread with condensed milk for dipping. Bread was fried perfectly!  Make sure you eat it right when they arrive at your table. 

Pro tip:  They don't take reservation. Arrive early."}
{"text":"Fresh vege and meat all the time. My favorite broth is Special Tomato. Compare to the other hotpot restaruant, their Tomato broth is strong and special. You can ask for some Sichun Chilli to make it spicy if you are a spicy lover. Also the Chine legendary broth is athentic, my friend had it. Just order mild if you don't want to put fire on your tough. Plum juice is good with hotpot,sour and sweet. 

Their host is friendly and polite. Foods were served so fast,very effciently. For dessert,I especially into Taro Roll and Fried Golden Chinese bread,so match with condensed milk.

Love it! Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"It was all of our first time having Hot Pot. Our server was extremely helpful and friendly. He helped us and gave us advice on what to order and how much of it to order. The food was delicious and the sauce buffet was a first for us and a really cool touch."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy soup base and it had some bite which was a pleasant surprise. This place has a great variety of items to add to your pot's and you can control the amount of dishes you order, but you only get two chances to order. It may seem limiting, but you can request the specific number of dishes you want per item, so it works out alright. The restaurant has some nice touches here and there compared to other hot pot restaurants I've been to but the soup base was a little on the underwhelming side, however the place has a great variety of add on items for your dipping bowl. 

Food aside, our visit was marred by abit of a bummer experience. Friday's are considered a \"weekend\" so its more expensive to dine on that particular day. This is apparently a standard across AYCE restaurants in the city, however the menu is misleading in presenting that information. It just states that weekends and holidays are more expensive but keeps Friday's classification as a \"weekend\" unwritten. If this is an easy cash grab for people unbeknownst to this who dine on fridays, I'm not sure. But if they were more transparent with this AYCE standard, then it would make it feel less like a sneaky cash grab and people know what they're in for upfront rather than when they get the bill.

**Update: The owner of this establishment reached out and said that they would be updating the menu to be more transparent and informative with the weekend pricing model. This is appreciated, it will help educate people like myself who aren't familiar with AYCE pricing."}
{"text":"I was so excited about finding this authentic hotpot place in Toronto while visiting from NY. It is a clean place with expedient and friendly service.  My only suggestion is don't underestimate the spice level.  I ordered medium spice, and it diminished my enjoyment of the food because it was way too spicy for me.  Maybe I'm a wimp, but order mild and you can always add spice in the dipping sauce.  Good place, lots of locals."}
{"text":"This is the first time my family tried hot pot. 11 and 15 year old boys, my hubby and myself. Looked at the yelp reviews and thought we would try it. From Cleveland Ohio where there are no hot pot restaurants. 1. We are the only non asians which is a good thing. 2. Menu is confusing and even after we get a broken English explanation we realize we have no idea what we are doing. 3. Helpful manager, Cecily, explains how it works and we are ready to go. Big pot of soup, you get meats, veggies and rice/noodles to cook in your \"hot pot\". Super fun and interesting. Ramen noodles are fresh and still had flour on them. Soup was a little salty. Condiment area so you can get a mini bowl of condiments to dip your stuff into. About $15 per person. Great fun!  It might be helpful to have a written explanation for first timers."}
{"text":"Was craving hot pot and went here with a friend who loves food as much as I do. First of all they really thought out the interior of this place. Very pretty. Doesnt look dingy like some hot pot places in the city. So we order and the girl politely says we had ordered too much and if it was ok to reduce it and we can order more if we wish afterwards. Ofcourse we agreed because she was probably right! Did I mention we were craving hot pot and we love food?? So the meal comes? We both order the spiciest soup which was the suicide I think, i had to change soups midway. Not because it was spicy but there was a spice in there i didnt like. So yeah, I changed to black chicken soup which was good too. We really enjoyed the meal. Would probably come back for special occasions. Our total cam up to about $40 each before tip. Whew! Has hotpot always been this expensive?? Anyway, 4 stars because everything from the decor, the servers and the food was amazing. The price although it shocked me a little was fairly reasonable for the amount of food we consumes. P.S. you MUST have the dessert. So gooood."}
{"text":"Given that there aren't any Japanese Shabu-Shabu restaurants in Toronto, or at least none that specialize in it (some izakaya's offer a dish), I found myself looking for a good chinese hot pot place. I came across Chine and have to say that this place is amazing. 

You are able to order as much as you like, but only in 2 rounds. You pick your broth, then the food you want. Sometimes service can be a bit slow, but everything comes out as ordered (at least it has for me when I've visited). Clean and new inside. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Alright.  Let's get my main gripe out of the way first.  They do not have two-tops.  You are forced to share either a 4-top or 6-top with other people.  I'm normally ok with that except they wanted us to sit at a table where the other two guys definitely  S  P  R  E A  D    O  U  T.  We'd be relegated to only a smaller portion of the table.  Finally, the lady saw my stink face and attempted to corral the guys by pushing their stuff over. They stopped short of asking the guys to pull their shit together.

Service started out very attentive.  (Think they were still trying to make me feel better about having to share a table with the two inconsiderate mofos who, btw, continued to attempt to spread their crap out.)

Food was good.  But then again, I love hot pot and it takes A LOT to screw this up for me.  Like making us share a table with a couple of jerks who were actually very demanding on the wait staff and somewhat condescending. It was mainly one guy being that way, but he was instructing the other guy on how to act, too!

The food portions were nice.  You ordered with a sheet of paper that gave you multiple rounds.  After the first couple, though, you can just ask for individual items directly from the servers.  

DO NOT get the beef tendon - I dropped them in our pots at the start of our meal, kept trying it all throughout and it never got tender. DO get the meats, including the Special Beef Slice and screaming chili beef.

Go easy on the sauces.  I realized a lot of it was very very salty and ended up cutting it with much more sesame sauce.  Or I just used regular soy sauce.

Service dropped off at the end though the two guys next to us plowed right through that issue and were very aggressive in their approach to getting more food.

We left with our tummies satisfied but I wouldn't rank this place much higher than the other hot pot places I've been to."}
{"text":"I came here because it had the highest reviews compared to other hot pot places in the area like Liu Liu and Little Sheep. I was pretty disappointed at the choices available and the price. This place only lets you order 2 rounds and had less options available compared to Little Sheep - they had 2 dessert options, not as many sauces, and not as many seafood options/meat options. The broth is also an additional $3 to the AYCE price. Service was decent, but I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"A very interesting experience. The food is fresh (and the tofu and ramen delicious).
It s still a boiling chinese type of cuisine, so don t expect an explosion of flavor, but it s definitly worth the try. 
Also expect to be a bit lost, it s a \"make it yourself\" type of ambiance, so ask for help.
The staff is extremely friendly, and the ambiance very authentic."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! 
I came here with my family when they came to visit me. Seeing the great review on yelp, I decided it would be a good place to try.
First, the service is horrendous. There was 6 of us & we were so squished at a booth we asked to be seated at one of the round tables. The server said no, because those tables were only for parties of 8. Shortly after, a party of 5 comes in & is seated at one of those tables. Extremely annoying. The table was so small that we could barely sit comfortably and have our food on the table. 
Second, shouldn't AYCE hotpot price include the soup? This place is expensive as it is ($26 pp) AND you have to purchase your soup for an additional $3-5. Why not say $29 pp & not charge for the soup? My brother asked for one of the spicy ones & it was soooo sour. He politely asked to change his soup & they charged for both soups! 
Thirdly, THEY DON'T DEVEIN THEIR SHRIMP. This is disgusting. We love our shrimp! What a huge disappointment when we ordered a whole bunch & they were literally full of shit... absolutely unacceptable.  Plus we had to constantly remind he servers we were waiting for our food. There are so many other great places to eat in Chinatown for the fraction of the price. It came out to be about $200.
WE CAME HUNGRY & LEFT ANGRY"}
{"text":"Tried this place with meetup group. With drinks, tax and tips, it is about 35 per person. So full afterwards. I like the dish that wraps beef with chilli. The deep fried taro tastes good. It is a good hotpot buffet place. The service is not bad. The soup base tastes good itself. The veggie is pretty fresh.
I came during a weekday night, so there is no line-up."}
{"text":"Clean and modern hot pot restaurant with quick service! Ingredients tasted fresh, and they had a good amount of variety. I'm not really an AYCE person but if you are I would recommend this place. 

I had the \"variety mushroom\" broth. I tried the following: watercress (very fresh), shiitake mushroom, taro (yummy!), lotus root, shrimp (has the shell on, which is annoying to peel), mussels, squid, quail eggs, and fried rice cake. They also have a seasonal fruit platter, which was slices of watermelon. 

We paid $34.60 each, not including tip/tax."}
{"text":"The hot pot here is very very good. It's not only because it's an all-you-can-eat restaurant, but also because the hot pot soup here is very Chinese and delicious. The have many options of soup favours, and the dishes were fresh and yummy. We enjoyed our gathering so very much."}
