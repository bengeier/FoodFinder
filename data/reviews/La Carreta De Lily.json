{"text":"Out of the handful of times I have visited this location customer service is either okay or good, nothing too bad or too good. The food is awesome and hits the spot if you are looking for some delicious mexican snacks! This is my favorite place to get chamoyadas and taki elotes. Whether this location or the one on Van Buren. The food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great foods ranging from fresas con leche to chicharones with cueritos! Love stopping here!"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing tosti elotes and mitotero mango loko  all to die for! The prices are very reasonable and the service is always great the line sometimes gets pretty long but our always moves very fast and you don't have to ever worry about quality of product I've never been let down!"}
{"text":"I really love the fresas con crema and the horchata from this place."}
{"text":"Horrible service, I only go there for one thing, been going to this specific location for work related, every single time they charge me a different amount for the same thing I always get.  They act like they are making you a favor by giving you what you ask.  I see them being nice to other people, I'm Hispanic too and I always say hi to them and try to be polite, I talk to them in Spanish too. To be more specific what I always get is a mango in a cup with everything they put on, I only ask them to cut it in squares, I guess they don't like that.  Last time a girl did the mango for me, it was so spicy I couldn't eat it,  today I tried again, there was no one when I got there, meaning they should've made it in no time but for some reason it took close to 5 min, witch it's not a lot but it kinda is when there's no one else, when they finally gave me the mango it looked more like a smoothie than the mango..  I asked why so much liquid, he said because the mango was too maduro. I said I didn't want it like that, and they all looked at each other, never apologized or anything. It's not about the mangos it about they're all attitude. I said sorry I don't like it like that, it just gave me the impression something was wrong, who knows what they do behind when they are making the mango.. overall just terrible service.  If you are Mexican you probably will be fine."}
{"text":"Please do not go here. I've been overcharged countless times and seems as if they charge whatever they want since no prices are on the menu. I bought 2 elotes, drove home and they had put the cup in a plastic bag to keep from spilling but when I opened it up a roach crawled out. $15 I won't get back. Save your money"}
{"text":"REAL good. So creative! And most of the time they are real friendly! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing ! Small mom and pop shop BUT everything is delicious. Looks family owned and ran.   There is always a line. Never anywhere to sit. I normally go on the weekends so that could be why BUT every time I've gone they are busy. My fave is the Mango Loco and the Fresas con creme !"}
{"text":"There are no reviews for La Carreta De Lily. Am I surprised? HECK NO!  If you want to taste desserts that are literally unlike anything you have ever tasted in your life, take a trip to La Carreta De Lilly! I am so hooked on this place I MUST go at least once a week (usually Sundays) to get my fix!   They sell \"raspados\" with a twist. \"Raspados\" are shaved ice mixed with fruit flavor. La Carreta De Lily has various ways of serving it.   My favorite is the \"Chemix\" which is strawberry raspado topped with vanilla ice cream. Over the ice cream is chunks of bananas and strawberries and pecans (requested by me), They have an array of drinks and flavors, your best bet would be to check it out for yourself!   It's in a hidden location and the menu items are almost completely foreign- however the drinks are AMAZING and you will feel extremely privileged to have discovered such an amazing place.   Summer time + Raspados = BLISS.  Yes, BLISS people. BLISS. (It's THAT good)."}
{"text":"This place has to be the place you go to if you can't find the ice cream truck or the corn man! Hahha They don't just have ice cream but also come delicious mixed mexican candy and fruit drinks. If you like Mexican snacks and candy don't be afraid to taste one of there tasty treats."}
{"text":"Good but a bit pricey elote cup very good raspado a little watery. Very easy to find from hospital area."}
{"text":"I found worms in my esquites !!!!! What the flying fudge Is that !!! I would put no stars if I could I know Lilia and she's better than this Jesús does not approve !!!"}
{"text":"Very pricey and the items aren't that good. Their customer service is ok but needs improvement as well as their snacks quality."}
{"text":"Been going here for years! Even though it's still average it's close and open!!!!! I would give it 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. I had the fresa con creme it was so good had a lot of fresh strawberry's great flavor. My partner had the fruit salad that she took down in about five mins she loved it so much. The only down fault is we had to take it to go and they put the fruit salad in a box which then came pouring out of the sides all over the place. Maybe try a bowl for people who take it to go. The place is a little small but makes it all more of a local place to go to for some great raspados!   Staff - a young gentleman not very nice we asked if we could have a min to review the menu he said well then we should not have walked up but in Spanish not thinking we understood but do. I did not get his name but he could have definitely had a better attitude.  Cleanliness- everything looked clean to me tables where wiped down floors looked pretty clean had a clean smell"}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely my number one choice for treat weekend. The staff is friendly, very helpful and willing to answer any questions you have."}
{"text":"Me and my family always come down here for sweets and cravings.. whether it be raspados, ice cream, elotes, nachos, etc. options are endless it seems. It's a small spot and does get packed, but the quality of product is good."}
{"text":"Bad customer service no one greeted us they were not friendly except the male worker that was outside getting the inventory. There was no line, me and my friend waited in front of the girl for like 5 min and she didn't even pay attention to us she didn't greet us. She was talking to another lady. When she finally took our order she was just like what would you like? I told her and then she turns and talks to the other lady and leaves without even saying excuse me or anything. She turns around again and asked me anything else, she turned to talk to the lady like three times while I waited for her to get my complete order. When my order was complete I waited another 3 minutes till she was ready to tell me the total. When the girl gave me my food I smiled and said thank you and she ignored me I was like  seriously. So annoying  it would have been different if she wouldn't have been really rude"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Fresh, fun and a party in your mouth! Especially LOVE the Tosti Elote!  Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"These Raspados shops have been popping up all over town lately.  This place is the first one my wife and I tried, and it was amazing the first time we went.  Not only are all the combinations of ice cream, shaved ice, fruit, etc really really good, but they have an assortment of salty snacks like Tostitos de Elote, which are really awesome as well.  There is one problem: the prices have gotten insane.  We first started going here, and while it was never a cheap snack, it wasn't too bad.  We recently went back and spent over $8 on one dessert which used to be closer to $5-6.  With all the other Raspados shops around now, I'd say you can travel just a short distance to find the same treats at better prices."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week and it was great. I had the tosti-locos and my goodness they were amazing. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"muy buena variedad pero el cajero se tardo horas platicando con si amigo teniendo linea, tienen de 4-5 empleados y solo un cajero, que para variar se toma su tiempo platicando con amigos."}
{"text":"First time coming to this location mostly go to the one in Mesa. I really like getting the Mango Loko, the best one I've had. Super clean. They could work on being a bit more friendly but overall would come again."}
{"text":"Love their yummy treats! I have been coming here for years now and I am always satisfied with their yummy treats."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They sell delicious Mexican desserts that you must try at least once. This location has been recently renovated and made bigger. Before it was really small, but now it's a lot bigger, and it looks like a comfy ice cream shop you can hang out at. Lines tend to get long, but it's worth the wait, the food will not disappoint!   I would say their specialty are the raspados."}
{"text":"This is the ULTIMATE Mexican munchies spot!! They have everything delicious and weird we like :) mango loko, obispos, banana split, Thrifty ice cream, Tosti lokos, elotes, fresas con crema, coco rayado con limón y Chile, regular ice cream smoothies, and Mexican candies like borrachines, Carlos quinto, duvalines, mazapanes, etc., etc.,. The people are really friendly and helpful, the place is immaculately clean, the hours are great... AH! Nothing bad to say :)"}
{"text":"Only got a one star because I had no option for 0 stars.! Came to quenche my elote craving...and let me tell u it, it was NOT quenched.! Corn had no flavor. And just gross.!"}
{"text":"This place has by far the worst customer service and their things are way over priced. They don't even have the prices on the menu so you constantly have to keep asking how much everything is and the employees give you attitude every time you ask them something. They have two young boys running the store and they're just on their phones doing nothing. I've seen multiple people complain about their orders and I've only been here 15 minutes. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love trying new little places. We were having a hard time picking something because everything from the menu looked so good. It was also hard to pick because the menu only had the name of the item and the picture but no description on what the item contained. Also, their menu did not include prices which made it a little frustrating because I like to know exactly how much I'm spending. Other than that I think they are doing great.  We ordered the small Tosti Elote $4.50 and Mitotero $7. They were both delicious and very different from what I had before. I think the Tosti Elote was a reasonable price but for the Mitotero I think it was a little too high.   In conclusion the place was nice and clean, and we were happy with what we ordered. We will definitely come back again and try something different from their menu."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! The service was horrible. The young guys behind the counter had no customer service skills whatsoever and were rude to the customers especially an elderly gentleman who was asking a question about his cocoloco. They completely ignored him.  I felt so bad. The items we ordered had more ice than ingredients."}
{"text":"Small place but there deserts and treats are very worth a stop. The fresas con Crema come with a lot of strawberries and it's not overly sweet and come in sizes. The tostilokos are loaded and they come in two different sizes as well. The location is a little sketchy and small but very good place to stop for a sweet snack."}
{"text":"I am so upset an 1 hour later and still didn't get our order. MY boyfriend and I went to get two ice cream cones. We waited in line for about 15 minutes finally we got to the cashier and she was so rude! While trying to get our two simple ice cream cone order she kept getting side tracked by a chunky guy which I'm assuming is the owner and this young guy. She kept asking what kind of ice cream and she didn't get it the first or 2nd time. Two damn simple cones. Finally she got our order with an attitude and she took another 5 minutes writing our order. Finally we wait for our order 30 minutes pass and we still didn't get our order. People that ordered complicated orders such as tostilocos clamatos nachos that were orders after ours got there orders at this point I am upset because we had been waiting longer. Finally I speak up and ask the chunky guy how long will our order take its only 2 simple cones and he's all you have to wait I'm like I don't understand how people after  me got there order. Seriously get had no valid point even a customer noticed everything and said something too. I am disappointed they didn't value me as a customer they didn't do things right they also didn't have no sense of urgency! We will no longer go to this place!! I am so upset with how they handle the business oh BTW there were only 3 people at this place waiting for orders"}
{"text":"The tostielotes are to die for! Also try the obispos (shaved ice & ice cream) yummm!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE! This place is dirty the guys working there don't know what hand hygiene is, they were not wearing gloves while preparing the food. All three of them were very rude. I won't be going back to this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Great find! They have everything you might need for that hot AZ day! Raspados are delicious. Very friendly, highly recommend when you are looking for a sweet or even salty treat."}
{"text":"I always come here for my fresas con crema addiction, the prices are great and the food will making your mouth water for more! The fruit is always so fresh!"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty and friendly service. The fresas con crema and ice cream flavors are tasty. A ton of Mexican candy and treats for sale, too. There are two dining rooms with tons of seats."}
{"text":"They have some bomb ass stuff here. They r opened till 1030 pm every day. They r all over the valley. 6 in desert sky itself"}
{"text":"YUMMY !  Thrifty's Ice Cream, Raspados, Mexican Candy, every sweet and delicious Mexican thing you can think of is in this tiny stop.   I got this fresas con creme. A M A Z I N G.  A little pricey ($8) but definitely big enough for 2+ people to share. What I loved most about it is, that its not too sweet where you can't eat more than a few scoops, there was a TON of fresh strawberries, and its topped with thrifty's ice cream! Seriously, was better than heaven.   Theres only a couple tables with chairs so expect to take these goodies to go.   Environment: 3/5 Food: 5/5 Price: 3.5/5 Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"A little piece of Mexico churerrias. Mango lokos, Chamoniadas, raspados, dulces and all other kinds of goodies. Love the smooties and chamoniadas. Plus a bunch of mexican chips and candy."}
{"text":"Great desserts! Kinda small but the food is worth it. They have Mexican treats, ice cream, antojitos and other great snacks."}
{"text":"Awesome service & affordable! We bought a large lemonade, 2 elotes (1 in a cup, 1 on the cob), & mango for $14."}
{"text":"This neveria is a pretty good place - not my favorite dessert establishment, but certainly passable.   On the downsides, the location sort of sucks, and the ordering process is confusing and weird.  I had to get some clarification of what was what, and what options I had.    On the upside, this is not your average neveria and odds are if you can dream it up, it is on the menu.   All in all, a good place, but not great."}
