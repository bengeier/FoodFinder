{"text":"This is my first stop every time I go to Vegas. These are the best hot dogs ever. The price is quite high for the amount of food, but it is so very worth it. 2 dogs and a chili cheese fry is $11.84 and is the best way to go."}
{"text":"It was terrible.

I had :

 (1) 2 hotdog combo with Sauerkraut , Lg Crinkle Cut French Fries and 1 Heineken beer          $17.24

i picked up the hotdog and the bun totally disintegrated , incredibly small hotdog compared to the price, the fries were cold and over cooked.

The beer was cold"}
{"text":"Keep on walking. Make a different choice. 
Horrible fries, we even went back for a do-over. Still undercooked and soggy. Lousy and slow service. Overpriced even for airport vendors."}
{"text":"NOTHING chases away a Vegas morning hangover like their Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich.  It's a little pricey, but the sandwich is huge and comes with fries.  I can't leave Vegas without stopping here a least once.

I've tried some of the other locations along the Strip, but the Luxor location is just better.  Oh yea, they also offer a pretty decent quick breakfast too."}
{"text":"So, I've never had authentic Nathan's and, based on reviews, wish I'd had the opportunity to try it before this Vegas excursion. But if you just want a chili cheese fry and a hot dog with relish, ketchup, mustard and onions, Nathan's at MGM is sufficient. The food was fast food good. But they did mess up the order which should have added chili and cheese to the dogs.  Mind you, I'm a burger and fry freak who does triathlons at the Iron distance so I don't take my cheat meals lightly. And I was more than happy to gobble down this hot mess before moving on to the next adventure."}
{"text":"This place was really bad food was awful my fries were cold. The place was dirty no one table was wiped off."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch, and ordered the Krispy Chicken Sandwich and Fries. 

The sandwich was bland, but the sauce they use is pretty good. Everything else in the sandwich didn't have much flavor in my opinion. The fries were pretty good though! 

The service was good, and they got out order right! Wait time before we got our food was about 10-15 minutes, which was fine considering it was about 12:30 pm on a Saturday.  

Will probably not eat here again."}
{"text":"I grew up in Brooklyn New York home of Nathans famous in Coney Island.. it was just as good the hot dog had snap french fries were cooked perfect a little bit more expensive than when I was a kid but what do you expect on the Vegas strip at the Venetian hotel you're going to pay extra.. The service was fine they even give you a little pager once your food is ready they page you.. I would have given it a 5 star review but the prices were a little high but nevertheless I will be back"}
{"text":"Seriously, I had to wait too long for my food. I was starving and come on we ordered hot dogs. It shouldn't take too long to make a hot dog right? Especially if I there was no fixings on it. The hot dog was average, nothing I would come back for. I think I could make a better hot dog at home. I do have to say that I did enjoy their chili fries. I don't think the food was worth the wait or the price."}
{"text":"Best inexpensive breakfast so far at the MGM
Ordered Scrambled eggs & bacon with a side of sausage, coffee and no toast. Eggs were moist & fluffy and I loved that they added country gravy on top of my eggs without charging extra. Nice! Gravy great flavor, the bacon I prefer crispy and it wasn't but was still warm and good. Sausage was hot and had good flavor. Preparation area seamed clean, servers were friendly and attentive to what you wanted. Note, they have hot sauce if you need it. Fourth day at MGM best breakfast so far, two more days and two more places to try."}
{"text":"Two people
Order 1: Philly Cheesesteak: $14 - Yuck! No flavor and very expensive. 
Order 2: Chili Cheese Hotdog: $8 - Good but very small. It's like a kid's hotdog. 
Order 3: Regular drink: $4 

Two stars because it did fill me up. I had to force myself from finishing my $14 cheesesteak. Soda has free refills."}
{"text":"I ate here Saturday afternoon with my wife. This is the Nathan's in New York New York casino on the West side of the building (the bigger one). We ordered a Philly cheese steak sandwich to share, since we're not big eaters.  The sandwich came with a side of large crinkle cut fries.  Both the sandwich and the fries were excellent. The sandwich was as good a cheese steak as I have had (never been to Philly).  It was more than enough food for us to share. The staff was very friendly, and they bring your order to your table."}
{"text":"The food wasn't as good as they advertising it, I can buy a hot dog across the street for .99 cents and it tasted better. The staff would interrupt customers when they were in the middle of ordering. The only good thing was the pop, it was refreshing, although both of the females working did not want to refill a cup that offers free refills."}
{"text":"Just tried a footlong hotdog and it was so good. It had sauerkraut ketchup and relish. It was really good and the French fries were really good too. The price is very reasonable too. Good bang for the buck.   





Had pancakes here this morning. They were good and my husband had a breakfast sandwich and he enjoyed it too. Not bad for a fast food"}
{"text":"Just meh.  I walked over from the westin and kinda expected a hot dog bar where you could pick and choose from fresh condiments. But that is nowhere near this. Never been to a hot dog place where they had to give you a beeper - and I was the only one there.

I think the only thing Nathans authentic is the weiner. Everything else is standard processed junk food.

All this for a $12 foot long hot dog.  That is worse than the ballpark."}
{"text":"I went to eat here thinking this was going to be fast service. I don't know how this place stays open.The food was okay but nothing like the Nathan's in Cony Island. It's the people working behind the counter that is really bad.They look as if they don't want to be working there. Poor attitude and the blank look on their faces when they serve you. They forgot my order and then said someone else took my order."}
{"text":"We got some coupons for hot dogs/pizza here after riding on the roller coaster at NY NY (key word: after). Bad idea. The pizza was gross and the hot dog was just ok. The service was horrendous. Seriously... why does it take 20 minutes to get a pre-made slice of pizza and already cooked hot dog?! Do they assume everyone is drunk and won't notice? Seriously, don't bother. It's not even that cheap."}
{"text":"Sorry, this place stinks!!

Paid $60. To take four starving teenagers to lunch, and then had to feed them again an hour later because they didn't finish the greasy gross mess from Nathan's.

Where to start...

Chili on the chili cheese fries was disgusting.  

The crinkle cut fries were over cooked and just plain yucky.

Cheeseburger bun was dry and flakey.

Chicken strips were all breaking, no chicken.

Hot dog?   Rather have Pinks :)"}
{"text":"Strike 1: At the Luxor food court, I decided to get the Philly cheese steak with fries for $10. The fries were good but the meat on the Philly was old and grey and I only ate half the sandwich. I felt like crap for the rest of the night. Strike 2: Nathan's 2 hot dog meal sounded the best and there was a small line and for $9 it sounded ok. Hot dog tasted kinda off but I was hungry and finished the meal. At 2am I woke up and barely made it the the bathroom before a dos hot dog meal violently launched out of my face hole and into the toilet. I won't be back for strike 3."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Went there over the weekend for a quick snack to tie us over before our dinner reservation later.  Big mistake.  We ordered two hotdogs, two fries, and two orange drinks.  The food preparer filled our one order of fries, then realized that she didn't have enough for the second order, so she had to get the manager who told her to make more, and she did this all in slow motion.  I've never a seen anyone move so slowly in a fast food place.  They then decided to give our one order of fries to the next order, so now we were waiting for our entire order, \"so it wouldn't get cold.\"  Seriously, if they were low on fries, they should've just told us and we wouldn't have ordered them!  Now we were stuck waiting an extra 15 minutes we weren't anticipating, when we were already on a time crunch.  Every place I've ever been, if you have to wait for something, you can at least sit down and eat the rest of your order while you wait,  and they tell you there will be a wait BEFORE you place the order. So we FINALLY get our order. The hotdogs were plain, nothing special.  The fries were WAY TOO HOT to eat!  The best part of the order were the orange drinks. We will never go back there!!  What a waste of time!"}
{"text":"It was the worst food I had. The fries were burnt and the Philly Chicken sandwich was too oily. It was too expensive, I paid $21. I would never eat there again."}
{"text":"This place is getting bad ratings. I have to admit, it is pretty good. Their chili dog was not that bad, although is was not healthy. I guess I was really hungry at the time. And their fries was awesome. One of the better fries I had in a long time. Price is a bit steep, oh well, your in vegas. Who cares. I came to realize that $20 is literally $1 out there. To me, thats a cheap dinner versus spending $60 plus on dinner.

Overall : not bad. chili dog $5.95
                                 fries $4.00"}
{"text":"Go Kobayashi style on their hot dogs. Not bad, but not great. Enough to keep you going while at the Ballys Sport Book."}
{"text":"Three chill dog and fries, with drinks comes out to fifty dollars. Fries were bland, the chill had no flavor. Regular bun and hot dog if was for the industrial era.  Service was petty slow. Drink were cheeper at the stalls next to Nathan's."}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak: overcooked and flavourless, overall it was dry and a little disappointing. I love a good philly, and this was not that"}
{"text":"Of alllll the amazing places to eat in Vegas, I don't know why I came here.  Maybe it was the drive over and my body being in starvation mode but I ate here with some friends and was unimpressed.  I mean, I knew not to expect too much but I mean, I had SOME standards right?  Don't you guys host the hot dog eating contest every year?!?  Gimme a little quality!

I ordered a hot dog...duh...with chili and it was cool.  Standard hot dog size and the dog was good- hard to go wrong with mystery meat, ha!  Also got onion rings which were decent.  Friend also got crinkle fries which they loved but one of them got a salad and felt sick shortly after.

My advise is to walk on over to Paris, where the two hotels connect and eat at one of the restaurants or creperies there.  It is slim pickins with Nathan's...and it doesn't look like it gets any better with Sbarro next door."}
{"text":"Hot dogs, fries, etc are good. Most of the staff just stands around even when a line is forming. Eventually someone takes the order, but often times they don't place the order and the food isn't made. Two people in our group waited 20-30 minutes and no food ever came out. After complaining, they made some excuses and refunded their money. This place needs better management and/or staff."}
{"text":"Aside the prices the cheesesteak was awesome just needed a pinch of salt & pepper. Also it's  the only place in the NYNY to get free softdrink refiles! And last but not least the fries were amazing :)"}
{"text":"first time i had Nathan's ever while i was in the venetian last trip.  i was impressed, i really liked it.  went twice, first time had the philly cheesesteak which was really good, tasted great, and was pretty damn tasty.  second time i had a grilled chicken club sandwich, and it was also very good.  the fries were very good too, crinkle cut and nice and crispy"}
{"text":"Tried it while wandering around late at night after hearing all the hype. Plain and simple it's a hot dog all be it an expensive damn hotdog. Chili tasted like it came from a can and the hotdogs were a little over cooked. 40 bucks later I can now say I've had a Nathan's famous hotdog."}
{"text":"The people who are complaining about this place need to realize something...this is a fast food hot dog place....in the basement of a casino.  It is what it is.  If you are looking for a quick meal this works.  It's a hot dog people.  I'm from Chicago and I love my Chicago style hot dogs, but Nathan's does a decent job with their dog too.  Don't come here expecting 5 star food.  Come here when you want a delicious, greasy meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Had chicken club and chicken strips.  Fries could have been better.  Very good price for being in a casino. Right in the food court."}
{"text":"For $5 a dog you'd expect to get something great.  Costco has better quality than here.  I'll avoid this place from now on."}
{"text":"I had philly cheesy steak and wife had asian salad. Both were very good. Prices are comparable to any other restaurants in hotel- paid $30. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Nice snap to the dogs and the manager serves your order with panache!

Nathan's hot dog joint at the top of the Manhatten escalator in New York, New York is a great retreat for a quick classic American dog. We ordered a cheese and bacon, a sauerkraut two times and relish.

The fries are always crispy golden brown and plentiful. The onion rings are also yum. They are large and the onions are sweet. 

I recommend asking for any topping to be served on the side. They tend to have a heavy hand so the bun becomes soggy and the sidevoverpowers the taste of the dog. 

No matter what...Nathans dog is a great place to grab a quick snack of meal!"}
{"text":"Worse service!! I work at these mall and I would advise everyone not to go there and to save your money. The cashier lady is always rude and dismissive. Very displaced"}
{"text":"The food came fast and was delicious. Employees were very welcoming and friendly. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"Located inside the MGM food court, had this as a convenience stop more then anything. Basically had a meal from every restaurant just to have a variety...and yes, I do eat a lot. 

I had the Chili Cheese Dog and the Bacon Dog. I'm not sure if it was just this location, but the dogs themselves were a bit on the salty side. Good enough to eat though, I guess the saving grace were the toppings and the bun. I've had a lot better hot dogs, but if you were craving a hot dog and are in the MGM, then this is what you would want."}
{"text":"I tend to walk through Bally's on my way home from work and I walk by Nathan's Famous and look upon it with disdain.It appears on the surface to be a typical crappy food court fast-food joint.

I've tried the Sbarro(i think it's a Sbarro) next door and the food there is fuckin atrocious, so I went with Nathan's one day.

I'm really not a hot dog kind of guy, so I went with the Double Cheeseburger and Crinkle-Cut Fries.

The fries are pretty horrid.obviously frozen and not fresh.The true gem here was the cheeseburger.Greasy, succulent, and with a bun that isn't fancy or anything but it just works with the burger.I could probably go on a huge rant about how good this burger is, but I have a typing form of ADD.

You'll just have to take my word for it.

Also, there are some cute Latinas working the register there who are possibly jailbait.Be careful when flirting gentlemen."}
{"text":"My favorite is the chicken wings with the french fries...i don't really like their hot dogs although i know that's what they are famous for...definitely the chicken wings!"}
{"text":"Skip this location if you're in a hurry. There was a line of people; if hot dogs are your main thing then you should fill the grill ahead of time, especially during the lunch hour!

I asked at the register if they had relish, ketchup, etc., she said it would be in the bag. When I picked up my order after a long wait I asked about condiments and another person said they were in the bag too. I walked all the way to the gate only to find no condiments!

They were cheap on the napkins. Only gave three small ones for two hot dogs and chicken strips.

The chicken strips were over cooked. Considering they packed our hot dogs right away, before the strips were even in the fryer, there should have been no excuse. Oh, and they gave me the wrong dipping sauces!

Speaking of packing the hot dogs way too early, the one that had kraut on it had a soggy bun by the time we got to the gate to eat it, which was only a few minute walk.

This was my 2nd experience with Nathan's and 2nd disappointment. Considering how much I like hot dogs, I'll have to seriously rethink whether it's worth it to go to the Coney Island location. Famous or not, I'd rather get a hot dog at Costco for a $1.50."}
{"text":"2 stars for outlets to charge my phone and acceptable red wine. Wings were horrible - veiny. They were out of blue cheese which I find out after they deliver a packaged cup of Kens ranch. It's blazing hot in here and there are fruit flies! Avoid!!!"}
{"text":"The Philly cheese steak that cost 14$ was horrible. It had no flavor. The staff were incompetent with the register it took 2 people to ring up our order. Then it took 30 minutes to get a hot dog and a Philly cheese steak. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"if you love hot dogs, love Nathan's dogs and want to experience the genuine deal get to the Fashion Mall food courtI 

I started eating Nathan's hot dogs on the boardwalk in Coney Island when I was a child. Let's just say that was a long time ago. New Yorkers - and I am one of those - are famous for their love of hot dogs. Most of the dogs in the south west are boiled and don't have that crisp outer skin which pops with juice at the first bite. 

Taking the escalator up to the 3rd floor food court offered a wonderful sight - Nathan's is in Las Vegas! Would it be as good? Oh yes it was!! Perfect dogs with the same unique and perfectly cooked fries. 

So I went online and saw that Las Vegas has several Nathan's, but that many of the reviews indicated sub-standard quality and service. I know my friends and I will go with great regularity."}
{"text":"Super slow service; which made it seem even more overpriced. Took forever to get 2 hot dogs."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here today. She ordered the Foot Long Hotdog with onions, sauerkraut, and relish; she topped it off with ketchup and mustard. It was delicious. She would definitely order this again. I ordered the Chicken Philly Cheese sandwich. Delicious! And get ready for Nathan fries....they are huge and delicious! Not to mention they give free drink refills! We will definitely be back. Check out the picture of our meal!"}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled chicken sandwich & one order of chili cheese fries and it came out to a total of $19.44, and that was still no drink included! My friend ordered a bacon cheeseburger with regular fries, that was $18.00 and again, no drink. We were not about to spend over $20 for fast food. We have lived in Las Vegas our whole lives, we know even on the strip NO FAST FOOD JOINT cost this much! Getting our food, I was already upset about the price, so, after taking a bite of the chili cheese fries, I couldn't! The cheese & chili tasted as if they watered it down in order to produce more. The staff gave me a full refund and they were very fast and efficient about it. My friend was scared to ask for a refund. She took her meal to go, where I took my business to Bruxie, located down the escalators, passing the Zumanity theater, out the glass doors to your right, I had an enjoyable tasty meal that consisted of Waffle-Cut fries, delicious chicken tenders AND a choc-pb shake for a WHOPPING TOTAL of $9.86. My friend ate her food out of spite for not asking a refund. The ONLY positive thing was that the cashiers were VERY nice & attentive! But when staff leaves a workplace, obviously Nathan's, would still not be worth it! If you want a burger PLEASE go to Shake Shack (right next to Bruxie) I promise you'll have a DELICIOUS meal for under $20"}
{"text":"Yay for Nathan's everywhere in Vegas.  The cart by the monorail station has rescued me from my hunger on several occasions!  Searching online will get you printable coupons you can use to save a few bucks, which can later be spent on drinks! yay!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something not fried in the Luxor food court this might be your choice. Order in and out by 15minutes with several people in front, not too bad for a freshly grilled chicken on a Cesear salad. Other than the big portion, it is nothing extraordinary. Lettuce was cut evenly, dressing was on the short side. All in all nothing too fancy, just a regular chicken Cesear salad, I'd call this a safe pick."}
{"text":"I love this place now that I have tried their Philly cheesesteak sandwich. Although a bit pricey even to my standards at Monte Carlo, it was even more expensive at Venetian. I just think it is because if you pay that much for cafeteria style sandwiches and food, it would be a sit down restaurant but I mostly have only seen these inside food courts in Vegas. It was definately worth the price when I ate that Philly cheesesteak. I coudn't even finish the whole thing. Though it isn't worth it at Venetian for the same thing, go to Monte Carlo to get your fix."}
{"text":"food was burnt! 5 small crummy pieces of chicken like wtf!!! I complained and all they said was thst can't do anytji g about it"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. It tasted great and fresh. It is so mouthwatering. mm!"}
{"text":"I was desperately hungry. I regret ordering the breakfast platter from this place. For $15 I got:

A plate filled with eggs
2 pieces of bacon
1 biscuit
Gravy
1 Hashbrown

They were all greasy and flavorless."}
{"text":"Paid $ 70 for 2 chicken sandwiches,  1 foot long hot dog & waffles fries.
Overpriced and bland food is all I can say. 
Should've gone to the Mcdonald next door."}
{"text":"The world's famous hot dogs, Nathan's!!!

This particular Nathan's is located in New York New York Casino and fortunately this restaurant was located away from the smoke filled casino.  It's located on the second floor next to the arcades.  This was a positive thing because we hate smokers.  

Always heard about it but I never tried it until today.  Sure you can get the dogs at your local supermarket and put one together at home but nothing beats going to one of these hot dog places and chomping down on a Nathan's Original Classic Hot Dog with fresh crinkle cut French Fries with it.  You have your choice toppings on the hot dog: Chili Cheese, Chili and Cheese, Sauerkraut, Red Onions and Salsa.  

Why Four Stars, the food was good, it was an original back when but there are other hot dog stands that can rival and beat this one.  

Food          =    B+
Decor        =    A
Service      =    A"}
{"text":"At$8.00 for a plain hot dog it is a total ripoff. Can buy their hotdogs in the supermarket.  For suckers and tourists."}
{"text":"Nathan's hot dogs outside of Coney Island is a different story than the original.  I stopped by for a dog yesterday and the most annoying thing happened. You know when the bottom of the bun rips?  Yeah, both dogs had that problem which means that the buns we not so fresh.  I find the Nathan's across the street at NYNY to be much better on a previous trip.  But none comes close to the original location."}
{"text":"$4.95 for more hotdog bun than actual hotdog? I don't think so. I was still hungry after we left here and it wasn't even that good! My boyfriend and I had finished our 'food' by the time the other couple we were here with got their food. 
I'd rather go to Costco and get four of their huge hotdogs for the price of this one gross one."}
{"text":"Good hot dogs. A little pricey but it is Nathan's and I am fine paying for quality. Had it with ketchup, mustard and grilled onions. Also, the crinkle fries are also good. I look forward to trying a cheesesteak of theirs."}
{"text":"The customer service here makes you want to give up on humanity as a whole.

We went here twice on our stay in Vegas in late June, and both visits left a heck of a lot to be desired. The second visit, in particular, was noteworthy; For God only knows what reason, two female employees seemed to make a pronounced effort to ignore us, as we stood there awkwardly trying to get their attention for 5-10 minutes. At first we thought that they were busy with existing orders, but with no one ahead of us, and no one waiting on food, it became quickly apparent that they simply weren't working. Shortly thereafter, another customer came up behind us and waited for several minutes as well, before asking \"Are they taking orders?\", to which we could only answer \"We honestly don't know\". We ended up walking away, and took our business off of Bally's property."}
{"text":"I had a dog, it was tasty. It's a pretty good choice for being in Vegas. Lots of seating, quick service!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! If you don't order the items on hot dogs you will get it plain (even if items are listed on menu)"}
{"text":"If you want fast food other than the standard chains this is a welcome alternative. Burgers and dogs are good along with the fries."}
{"text":"Nathan's has the best french fries ever! The food and attached arcade makes it a great place to eat with a nostalgic feel."}
{"text":"Served a reheated Stromboli that looked to have been made that morning. Disgusting. Not only that, but the restaurant was dirty. Tables dirty. People must only eat here out of desperation when nothing else is open. Plus, the staff all looked miserable. They hate it here too!"}
{"text":"Nathan's at the Luxor is a place where you can get breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
Their sausage and biscuits for breakfast are very very good. It's a quick meal and not very expensive.
For lunch or dinner the hot dog with bacon and cheese is always a great choice. It is served with french fries that are pretty tasty.
The salads are huge and you can share.  They taste very good as well.
There is a little bit of a wait sometimes because they are so busy."}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge fans of Nathan's hot dogs. So when we found out there was an actual Nathan's location in Vegas, we were there. We were quite happy with the hot dogs themselves, but not so much with the price. Two hot dogs, two drinks, and a side of fries should not cost twenty-five bucks!! At that price, you might as well buy yourself a gigantic souvenir margarita glass!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service- no one was in line so we chose Nathan's at the airport. Never again- 20 minutes for fast food with no one in line? These employees clearly needed more training and were unable to work with each other."}
{"text":"I've had the hot dogs at the location inside the Venetian. Maaaan are they good! This time around, I had more of a craving for fries and chicken than a hot dog. Since it was located in the hotel I was staying at, I visited twice. I ordered the chicken tenders with fries the first time and  a regular sized bacon and cheese fries the second time. Everything was good, but  I couldn't get myself to finish at least half of it...both times! I think it's because their fries are cut pretty thick. They filled me up in no time flat. Next time I get something from here, I'll be sure to have someone to share it with. Except a hot dog. I'd like that for myself, please."}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon cheddar fries and philly cheese steak. The fries were delicious! Will definitely order them again. The philly cheese steak could use a lot more cheese."}
{"text":"One of the girls in our group needed a quick bite and none of the restaurants were open so we grabbed a couple chili dogs and an order of chili fries to soak up the alcohol. 
Our order was $30 and the most disgusting fast food I've ever had. How does chili have NO flavor? The dog was dry and flavorless. The fries were soggy and again FLAVORLESS!! I know they can get premium $'s in a hotel but at least sell a better product. Nathan's is famous? Really?
Must be a boardwalk thing - gross"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Just because it is mall food court does not mean it has to suck. 

Hotdog was very average. Buns were dry and the dog was not particularly juicy. It can't be what they are famous for, can it?

Fried fish has thick hard batter. I do like the thick cut fries but many of the pieces were over fried. 

Grossly overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"After a long hung over day, no one ever looks forward to traveling. My fiancé and I needed a quick bite to eat and we decided on Nathan's. There was no line so it was very convenient. I wanted something greasy so the hotdogs were a no go. We were met by a young rude lady that had no skills in customer service. She had an RBF which complimented her attitude. 
 
I ordered the burger and onion rings and my fiancé the grilled chicken sandwich. I can't speak for him but the burger was extremely dry and flavorless. The onion rings were pathetic as well. One of the rings I had was the very outside skin of the onion. It was extremely tough.

The jersey mikes next to them had much nicer staff and the food looked a lot more appetizing. Go there instead!"}
{"text":"I dont understand the bad reviews. This is one of the better food options in the LAS airport. They even were nice enough to stay open 30 minutes after closing to offer a food option to all the people who had delayed flights and were hungry. I got the Nathan's 2 hot dog special. They cooked the hot dogs a little long, which I like so they had a little char. I loved it! When traveling to LAS, this is my stop in the airport."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a late night snack and decided to give the famous Nathans a try. Wow, was I ever disappointed!! A skinny little average tasting hot dog for $5.00. Ripoff!! Save your money!!"}
{"text":"Melissa is horrible.  Rude. We order number 3 chili dog combo with large drink. (10.99) she asks if I want large fries. No. ( meaning medium is fine only wanted larger drink).. I've never had to break this down. 
   I pay with card so didn't notice total. But I get drink and chili dog.  Had to pay for fry. She then snaps \" I asked if you wanted fries\". NO MELISSA YOU ASKED IF I WANTED LARGE FRY.. RUDE. THEN I ENDED UP PAYING MORE FOR MY COMBO. 
   You should pay attention"}
{"text":"$3.73 for a chili dog. Pretty expensive. All the combos were pricey, too....for fast food. One of them was like $9.99. I don't want to just complain about the price but all I had was the chili dog.

The chili dog was good, don't get me wrong. There's a fixings bar and I piled on plenty of chopped onions. No jalepeños or tomatoes or anything fun...just onions and saurkraut. The hot dog was long and skinny. Too long for the bun, which was my only complaint. I'm sure they could have found larger buns for the dogs. They grill the dogs and put them into a steamed bun. The chili had a nice flavor. It was messy and tasty and just a little too much chili....just enough for me to have to scoop up after I was done.

For fast food, this place is too expensive. For the price of the chili dog I got, I could have gotten a full meal at McDonalds, Wendy's or Arby's. And I'm ever in downtown enroute to/from work...just enough time to grab a quick snack. I'm not about to spend 10 bucks on a snack downtown.

Pros: Food's good.
Cons: Food's expensive."}
{"text":"Not sure if this review is legitimate because we came here after two Fat Tuesday drinks!  We ordered other items from the food court as well and took it to the room.

However, the chili cheese dog was actually very good and the tator tots were so good I actually had my son go back downstairs for another order 

Staff were all friendly and for a late night meal or even a quick meal throughout the day this is a great option."}
{"text":"Looking at other reviews, it looks like this Nathan's is unique in its grossness.

We went there for breakfast on our last day in Vegas as we didn't want to spend time going to another hotel.  The line at McDonald's was long and there was nobody at Nathan's.  Now I know why.

The express breakfast (which is the only breakfast option) is $8 or $9.  The food was horrible and greasy.  My wife was literally gagging trying to choke down her food and ended up just eating the soft, moist toast.  I'm a bigger eater than her, and even I was having trouble.  Just disgusting.

The food on my plane ride here was much better.  If  you're trying to decide between the two, go for McDonald's."}
{"text":"It would be cool if I was Vin Diesel. Besides increasing the size of my biceps, lowering my voice 10 levels, and shaving my head, I could also simply call myself \"Vin Diesel\". However, at the end of the day, I am not Vin Diesel.

This hot dog place is kind of like myself calling myself Vin Diesel, but it's calling itself Nathan's Famous. In all but name, this place is not THE Nathan's Famous.

Nathan's Famous in New York, or Coney Island to be specific, is super delicious at a price point that may make you crack a smile despite the harsh realities of life. This place is not like that: it is in a food court. In Luxor Hotel. In Las Vegas on the Strip. So, therefore, it's expensive. Q.E.D.

It is probably one of the cheaper options in the food court, to be fair. And the hot dog, while not the Nathan's quality I have come to love, is passable (although a Costco hot dog, at $1.50 plus a soda is still somehow better). I also got a chicken caesar salad, because, you know, digestion, and that was somewhat decent but then again at $13 was pricey.

To summarize, I am not the Vin Diesel we know and love. And this is really not the Nathan's Famous we know and love."}
{"text":"This is a national chain hot doggery. They never disappoint & when you're looking for hangover cure I'd say this is a pretty good one. The hotdogs have the snap & all beef that they're known for. I also got the chili cheese fries to share & they were also yummy in the tummy. If in Vegas & need a quick bite or on a budget this place will do the trick."}
{"text":"Total lack of customer service. The cook saw me standing there for 5 minutes waiting to order and just stared at me while talking to the girl that was supposed to be working the front."}
{"text":"Delicious but I'm my opinion very expensive for fast food. I really enjoyed the philly cheese steak it was $14.99 with no drink or fry. We got 2 Philly cheese steaks and two cheeseburgers and it was $60 no drinks or fries. But Las Vegas is kind of expensive for food so you are going to pay higher prices to eat. This was the best thing I had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"You have to be a fan of Nathan's to love this spot! The food is spot on and is like any other Nathan's folks. The staff is also awesome and extremely friendly. Prices might be slightly higher due to being established in the hotel, but it's still an awesome options for a quick bite. Less than $15 for a fast meal. I'm a fan!

Ordered the hot dog, chicken fingers and fries. Was nice and full and ready to tackle the Vegas night. It's also located on the same level as the arcade or roller coaster. This alone had a nostalgic feeling bringing back memories of Coney Island as a kid.

There's enough tables to dine in or take it to go. The service is pretty fast and its made to order so don't stop here if your in immediate rush."}
{"text":"had the philly cheesesteak and fries from here. it was alright, nothing to write home about. but i was super hungry when we ordered so i enjoyed the hell out of it."}
{"text":"Yuck! Stayed at NY/NY and had a coupon for money off at Nathan's. Tried it out for dinner one night and was thoroughly not pleased. The hot dog is super greasy and just tasted like salt. A poor choice. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I almost forgot this place as I finish off all my reviews of my trip last week in Vegas. They have a lot of Nathan's spread out through various hotels. I just happen to be closest to this one inside NY NY. The hot dogs with grilled onions and deli mustard is pretty good. The price isn't bad considering its fast food in Vegas. If you have the munchies and want a quick bite, this isn't a bad place to go."}
{"text":"YEAH, i came here with my eyes bigger than my stomach...NOT A GOOD IDEA...
i ordered a chili dog,cheeseburger wit crinkle fries...ummm yeah...the chili dog itself can have done me good, the burger was awsome with all the fixins, ie: lettuce,tomato,onions,mayo..., and the fries...yummster...crispy outside, soft inside...but then again, i came here near closing, so they had to put a fresh batch for me and my friend...
Nathans was great because my co-worker and i wanted something fast, and good, and we got that...basically we were on a budget cause we were goin clubbing that night, so i atleast needed something in my stomach, and it worked...thanks NATHANS...till next time"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd try to get food at McCarran. Instead of getting food, we got to watch 2 cashiers argue with a customer about what drinks were available while 2 other employees stood and watched. 
You would think that they might actually want to sell food, but apparently they couldn't care less."}
{"text":"Although famous for hot dogs - the Philly Cheese Steak sandwiches are remarkable!

Full of juicy meat (you can ask for medium rare) and cheese with just the right amount of savory grilled onions and peppers.

Fries - like everything else is made while you wait so you know it's fresh.

Superior friendly service!"}
{"text":"Here's the lowdown: almost 5 bucks for a nasty chilidog that cost maybe .20 cents to make and $3.50 for a medium soda. I tried the one at Luxor, Nathans is so overhyped that the reviewers on here giving high marks got to be employees. The chilidog comes with beans which is stupid and the bun starts to fall apart on you as you try to eat it.  Even with the 2 for 1 coupon its a ripoff. You've been warned by a real yelper and not a fake review by their employees."}
{"text":"Hey there Southern California, Nathan's Famous is available to us less than an hour's flight away - as long as you don't fly American Airlines. 

Nathan's Famous has happily sat as the anchor position in the MGM Grand Casino's food hall for as long as I can recall and has always been the one place I end up at some point on every Vegas run. At first, ?this was mere coincidence but over time it has developed into a hardcore tradition built around my fondness for New York City and Chili Cheese anything. 

The menu is larger than it has any need to be but the focal point is obvious: Hot Dogs, Fries, and Hot Dogs. They also serve Salads, Chicken Sandwiches, and other sacrilege? but you will have to read about those options from the kind of Yelper that would get a Salad at Nathan's and then review it. You know - a \"Tool\". 

I always do things one way regardless of ?Nathan's location: One footlong? World Famous Chili Cheese Dog, Chili Cheese Fries, and the Old Fashioned Lemonade. If you just thought? to yourself \"That is too much Chili\" you are fundamentally incorrect. The Chili is what ties this all together?. That and you will be visiting? Nathan's far beyond inebriated?...

The Lemonade and Fries are just as good as the Coney Island original you love. The Chili Cheese Dog is a madman in its? own right but I will be real with it - I have come across some stale Buns over the years regularly which diminishes? a true classic ?if only a little. It is still the only Hot Dog I care about in Vegas.

As far as? cheap big box franchise fast food goes, Nathan's is well above the pack in the flavor to cost ratio and a late night \"must-do\" for any reveler that comes across the MGM on a Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Not your most clean diner located inside the New York Hotel Casino but offers very yummy food. Had a cheese pizza slice and chilli fries both were really good, again we need to dish out quite a bit of money. Not the cheapest eats for snacking."}
{"text":"Fuck their hot dogs.  Hot dogs all taste the same ... It's all about their Cheese fries with bacon bits and chicken fingers! MM!! i thats why i love this place.  

Price is a little steeper but it's in a casino so i'm not surprised.  Compared to what else is in the Palms food court it's a great option to have.  

I came here waiting for a movie to start up as i was ridiculously early and this always hits the spot for a hungry man.  And the lemonade is good to.  I mean it's not like FANTASTIC ... this is a food court after all but it beats the minute maid crap that like McDonalds has.

If i had to choose i say either this place or the pizza place next door is where to go for food in the palms food court."}
{"text":"The hotdogs rule, but you already knew that. They need to change the fry oil though. The fries had a funky taste. I ended up tossing them out."}
{"text":"What can be better than to attend a convention and be able to have Nathan's hot dog and fries. I look forward to the convention knowing I will have Nathan's for lunch. They hands down have the best fries and with cheese sauce it doesn't get any better. I think they need to spend more time training their staff and familiarizing them with their menu"}
{"text":"Staff is rude. Girl with the big cheap fake eyelashes didn't even pay attention to the line. No wonder you sell hotdogs for a living."}
{"text":"I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with crinkle-cut fries for $10 (@ the Luxor)!! The thinly sliced rib-eye  was tender but flavorless (had to sprinkle a packet of salt and pepper on top). There was also stringy grilled onions with sliced jalapenos and mushrooms, as well as melted White-American cheese within the long roll.

Totally not worth $10, and if you want a soda, it will cost you $3!!! Why can't they just include the drink to make it as a combo? (Annoying!) 
Since the meat had no depth to it, i give it a two thumbs down for this Philly Cheesesteak.

Definitely, not coming back.

**Was thinking of giving this place 2 stars, but since it was a half-ass combo (Philly Cheesesteak+ fries), that does not come with a DRINK!!!!, I have no choice but to bump it down to 1 star! Who wouldn't need a drink after eating this meal? Nathan, you are crazy.."}
{"text":"Don't ask for a well grilled dog because you will get attitude and be told that to meet that request it would take 3 hours on the grill to make it well grilled. Seriously? 3 hours? Next time I will skip Nathan's."}
{"text":"Giving this location 4 stars because the young people working when I went were incredibly courteous and helpful to me as a tourist. Fast food usually doesn't garner more than 2 or 3 stars from me, but I went during an unusual time and got more attention than I probably would have normally. Grabbed chicken tenders and a drink to go back to the game room and the kids even gave me extra tenders and sauce after I tipped the jar which made my day unexpectedly! They gave me directions to another part of the casino I was trying to get to and it was spot on. Great service, guys."}
{"text":"Customer service was really good Anna was very good and helped me with my order and the wait time for my food was like literally 3-4 minutes I ordered a footling chili cheese hotdog, crinkle French fries, a soda.. Total was $21. Reg. Soda $3.50, French fries $4.00 and a chili cheese foot long $12 Total is $21.02"}
{"text":"Wow, gotta love that double burger!!!
Great !!

Wow, the Worlds Best Hot Dog and great service !!"}
{"text":"$12 chicken sandwich and fries. I felt like I'll wasted $12 on a snack that wasn't that great.  Why can't In N Out be inside the casinos??"}
{"text":"This Nathan's was located inside of the food court at the Luxor. First off, the food court area looks outdated and feels like you're in old Las Vegas. There wasn't many food places to choose from, but I wanted to get Nathan's since they don't have this in San Diego. I was really craving a corn dog from here but found out that they didn't serve corn dogs at this location. The worker informed me that the menu's at each locations vary. That wasn't good to hear since I was really craving a corn dog from Nathan's. Everything on the menu was pretty pricey. I ended up ordering chili cheese fries and a soda and I think it came out to a little over $10. The fries were okay. Nothing great about it. I should've just gotten food some place else since I probably would've gotten more for my money.

This place would be okay if you wanted Nathan's and were in the area. But I don't think I'll be coming back here any time soon."}
{"text":"***While cheaper than a lot of Vegas spots, I was not a big fan of this hot dog spot and I assume it is not up to the quality standards of the New York locations***

Maybe Nathan's in New York is good, but Nathan's in Las Vegas (this one located in Bally's food court) is below average.  The hot dog wasn't nasty or anything like that, but I've had much better hot dogs.  It tasted like the kind of generic hot dog you would get at a run-of-the-mill baseball stadium.  Hot dogs are served with crinkle cut fries.

It was relatively cheap though compared to other Las Vegas spots."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I got a couple of hotdogs before seeing a movie. Her hotdog was small, stiff and cracked in half. Like it had be heated in the furnaces of hell and its soul broke into a thousand pieces. My hotdog was also small and stiff but was discolored .. The cheese had a goopish quality that reminded me of a floor dwelling sea creature. The lemonade was good."}
{"text":"I had the \"famous\" hot dog at the MGM and NYNY, they booth sucked ass. We had coupons for free hot dogs and we supposedly got the normal \"$6\" hot dog, what the hell? It tasted like shit free I can only imagine how mad I would have gotten if I had actually payed for that, slip it... it is NOT a cheap it for the strip, if you really want cheap and decently good hot dogs visit Bill's and go to the cart that is located at the Sports book."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a Nathan's in the food court of the mall because we just wanted to grab a quick bite but I always thought the hot dogs were a lot bigger.  We got a chili cheese dog, and it was smaller than the hot dogs you buy from the supermarket and cook yourself.  The meal was 7.50 and it came with fries and a medium sized drink.  It was just okay too.  The fries were really good though.   Maybe I have to try a Nathan's not in the mall because all the other Nathan's got 5 star reviews or close to it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Nathan's as a rule and this one is ok to a little better than ok.

Most stuff is good here but there is one item to miss... They have these garlic knott bread things that look great but be warned.... They are very dry and bland.

My hotdogs and fries were great though!"}
{"text":"Had this while we stopped to eat at Fashion Show Mall. 

I had the Chili Cheese dog and the Cheese and Bacon fries. OMGOSH. The Cheese and Bacon fries were heavenly. They provided enough cheese to cover all the fries too! The Chili Cheese dog wasnt anything special or out of the ordinary but the fries, you have got to try!"}
{"text":"after watching mama mia at mandalay bay, i was feeling kind of hungry. my boyfriend and i took the tram to new york new york. once we walked in, this was the first food stand i noticed. OOOOH! i wanna try this!! ive seen it on food network! 

not sure what all the hype was about.  but it tasted like a regular hotdog. but it was good. anyway, i remember paying $13 for 2 hotdogs, a side of cheese, fries, and lemonade. 

oh and i noticed they sell nathans hot dogs at the movie theaters (in daly city). i guess i'll just buy it there if im ever craving it again. its probably cheaper. =)"}
{"text":"Very slow service!  Will never go back!  Normally I'm very understanding because I've worked food service before, but there weren't many people being served.  We asked for a refund and they gave the wrong amount back, almost stiffed us $10."}
{"text":"I should have looked at the review stars before I ordered. Horrible! Cold mushy fries. Waste of money and I ended up throwing them away."}
{"text":"I never take a trip to Vegas without stopping by Nathan's. Sure there's a Pinks here in LA, but Nathan's dogs are surely the more flavorful of the two.  I've never had them in NYC, but love love love em in Vegas. They are pricey for hot dogs but just look in any little vegas coupon book or even on the tray liners in the food court itself for half off coupons. Fries are ok, seem very fatty to not be super bomb to me. A friend had the cheesesteak. Tasted hers and it was quite tasty. A solid choice for food stand grub in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great hot dog..pretty pricey..but it's vegas. I'm a purest with mustard. Their fries were just okay- mine were a little soggy. yum."}
{"text":"Little fast food restaurant inside Bally's hotel that's easy to get to. The line wasn't too bad both times I went around midday. If you pay with a card you have to show your ID (every place I went to in Vegas I had to show my ID with my debit card). 
I came here out of all the other options because I just wanted a salad. 
I ordered the Krispy Chicken Salad without dressing. I was a little disappointed because there was barely any cheese or croutons. I don't think it was supposed to come with anything else... But that was alright for me cause the lettuce and crispy chicken was satisfying. Plus I'm not a big fan of cheese anyway. 
They have a picture of a \"Krispy chicken club salad\" advertised and I thought I was going to get that but on the menu it's a \"grilled chicken club salad\" so you have to specify crispy chicken if you wanted what's in the picture. I got this salad for my boyfriend and he liked it so much he wanted it again the next day! This salad comes with tomatoes and bacon and other things. Not bad. Will come back if I stayed at Bally's."}
{"text":"This is definitely the worst Nathan's place ever.  The hot dog was so disgusting and the fries were soggy, greasy and ridiculously huge. The workers were in a bad mood.  And they didn't even say thank you at all.  Not even a fake smile.   Nothing!!!!! 
I do not recommend this place at all. I knew the price would be high. But the quality was the worst.  Costco hotdogs are way better."}
{"text":"Decent food served at Nathan's Famous. This one is located at the Bally's hotel. Decided to come here for a quick bite.

Prices are a little steep, but what can you expect on the strip?

Ordered the wings which were okay. Enough to get me full.  My friend ordered the Philly cheesesteak and he was very content. He is a fan of greasy food and the sandwich was super greasy! Yum for some, gross for others."}
{"text":"If I could give NO stars I would. Horrible customer service. I'm a diabetic and simply asked for ice to keep my insulin cold during my 1 hour 15 min flight to San Francisco  I even had my own cup I got a flat out NO however, for $3.95 the young lady was willing to sell me a cup of ice REALLY it's ice for crying out loud needless to say Burger King provided ice without ANY problem. TSA rules wouldn't allow me to bring my own cup thru security so I had to dump it out but the TSA agent stated I could get ice once I cleared security but didn't mention I had to pay a King's ransom for ICE."}
{"text":"Went to a convention and they had a Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs located inside the Las Vegas Convention Center. I ordered a hot dog of coarse but ate it before I took a pix because I was starving and got the chili cheese crinkle cut fries and a large pop to go with. 

The price were a little high and maybe because it was in the convention center but then again I have never been to a different location to compare it to so I guess when you don't have any other choice it is what it is. The service was quick and super friendly which made the wait not that bad. There was no where to sit except the floor but that's not their fault and the food was ok. 

The hotdog was good but just a hotdog I like their chili but the fries had no flavor much and was a bit soggy. All in all it was ok nothing to be \"Famous\" for."}
{"text":"Large waffle, soft and not crispy, and an optional bacon side. Simple fair and a slight step above Mc D's. No real complaints here. Only grab food from here if you're on a budget and if you are, why are you staying at MGM and gambling?

3 stars for decent food given that it is fast food. Breakfast ends at 11 or so. Seating is food court style."}
{"text":"Not the typical Nathan's quality and ridiculously overpriced. $28 for two people. No thanks."}
{"text":"I remember when I tasted my first Nathan's hot dog. It was at the original Nathan's at Coney Island in NY. I immediately declared it the best hot dog ever.  So, of course, I find myself somewhat regularly snacking at the faux Nathan's in the faux NY-NY.

Now, the hot dogs here may in fact taste the exact same as any of the real NY locations, but to me, they just don't. I have to deduct a star because this Nathan's just doesn't capture that special Nathan's quality.

But, regardless, these are some excellent hot dogs. Go for the chili cheese dog. And try to imagine eating it standing up on a boardwalk with a light salt air breeze blowing by. No really, that does make it taste better."}
{"text":"Food: good
Price: okay
Service: food court
Parking: good

Well, hot dog GOOD!! 
But standing in the line.. no server (food court).
I think its unfair if I give four stars or higher."}
{"text":"Over priced, too salty, and not enough toppings.... 

I am from Chicago so I'm partial to Chicago Style... but I'm not picky when it comes to a good dog... and Nathan's wasn't my cup o' tea....

Sigh... Wrigley and US Cellular field's hot dogs are so delicious..... I'd rather eat that..."}
{"text":"I had eaten Nathan's at the Luxor a couple of day prior to my visit here and it sucked. I saw that this location had pizza and it looked quite good. I enjoyed every bite of it. True NYC style!"}
{"text":"I think not.

I am a huge fan of NF's, but this was just not up to par. $15.00 got me a really skinny hotdog with bacon and cheese, greasy and mushy fries and a flat diet coke. I was pretty drunk and it was still bad."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  

After a disappointing experience at the club, I figured that some street food would cheer me up.  Neither the price nor the location was consistent with what one would typically consider street food, but it was close enough.  I stuck to the basics and got a hot dog with kraut, and it was delicious.  Very flavorful, and chewy but not tough.   Definitely worth trying if you happen to stumble across one and are in the mood for hot dogs."}
{"text":"Although not as a participant (I can't scarf down 30 hot dogs and buns and water), I attended the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest on the Brooklyn Bridge at the New York New York Hotel and Casino as an observer.  You won't see me on tv or anything, but you will see a glimpse of what I saw in-person today via photos.

The woman with the trophy won with 28 hot dogs and the older gentleman on the left won with 30.  They are headed to New York City on July 4 for the main event."}
{"text":"OMG this place is so overpriced. It was $25 for a hotdog, chili cheese fries and a large lemonade.  The Philly cheesesteak is $14.  They must fly it out from Philly for that price.  I was at a week long training with more than 500 other individuals and not one person said they had a good experience eating here."}
{"text":"meh. very meh. nice service, decently quick, school cafeteria level hot dogs. pretty good place for someone who is in Vegas and doesn't need something as fancy and prestigious as a carnival dog."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite for lunch and this was the only place serving something other than breakfast.  Now I'm wishing I gone for breakfast instead.  The chili was from a can, the cheese was  flavorless canned cheese and the hotdog casing was weirdly tough. It was almost like a thin layer of plastic.  Weird & gross."}
{"text":"Ordered the philly and the worst I've tasted. At Vegas the price is over inflated. With tax it's 15.13."}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars I would. I needed a cup of hot water. That's it. I asked Fernando for a cup of hot water \"I even have my own cup to pour it into\". He said \"oh no, we can't be passing things back and forth like that. Do you want just a water or hot water?\" I said \"hot water\" which was met with this reply \"oooooh HOT water, I'm gonna have to charge you for a coffee, or no, a tea, that more $2.29 for some water\". WHAT?! That's ridiculous. Where has customer service gone? I'll tell you where.... to Starbucks. Even though they were closed, the lady happily helped me.... and didn't charge me a dime. THAT'S customer service!!!! Skip this place, the employees no zero about customer service."}
{"text":"Ate their fries which were pretty good but kind of reminded me of fries out of the freezer. 

Had a Philly cheesesteak which was very tasty especially after drinking. 

Also tried the footlong hot dog that had cheese and bacon and that was pretty delicious too. 

The food wasn't to die for but was above your typical fast food and even better after binge drinking in Vegas."}
{"text":"Decent hot dogs"}
{"text":"I wish I had an image to match the corndog finger pics I keep seeing, but I don't. In regard to those corn dogs by the way, I agree, you won't be feeling like a winner walking away with one of those.

The last time I came through McCarren with my kids I dropped 70 bucks on food. Rather than stage an impromptu hunger strike, we decided on the two hot dog meal (two of them) and some bacon cheese fries.

The hot dogs were Costco quality in taste but not in size. (So, yes, they tasted like hot dogs, and for reference, they were bigger than my middle finger, which I checked out of curiosity only.)

The bacon cheese fries were meaty (a fair amount of chili, lots of bacon) and really satisfied. 

When starvation and taking out another loan from Cousin Sal aren't an option, consider Nathan's Famous."}
{"text":"Always liked Nathan dogs. But $12 for a dog and a lemonade? That's pricey. I could've found a cheaper item at the 24/7 Cafe down the casino for a sit down meal."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a quick bite. They gave us a completely messed up order- I ordered original chili dog and he charged me for a footlong. He forgot about the onion and relish even tho I repeated my order twice. They gave my bf a plain hotdog with nothing on it. Disappointed."}
{"text":"High prices, watery mustard and stale buns"}
{"text":"Warning. This is a franchise selling only 1/4 pound skinless dogs for 8 bucks each. No original skinless dogs sold. It is a nice food court but the dog tasted like something you buy at the airport except at higher prices. Bun was as stale as last years matzah."}
{"text":"When you're walking through the MGM Grand, headed over to the Signature side, and you're craving a good, snappy, hot dog, this place is a godsend. The only thing is that they're kind of pricey."}
{"text":"This place was terrible.  I hoped it would be a step up from McDonalds. Big mistake. The food was barely edible. $10 for chicken fingers and fries. The chicken fingers were overcooked. Bbq sauce was bad. Fries were both burned and soggy. Customer service was abysmal. Stay away."}
{"text":"YUCK!!!

We got one \"Famous\" hot dog, a pizza, and split the chili cheese fries, and boy were they all disgusting. The hot dog was rubbery, the pizza was definitely frozen, and the chili cheese fries should be called \"chili residue and nacho cheese over poorly thawed frozen fries.\" 

NEVER AGAIN!

Good: Nothing.

Bad: The food. All of the food.

Final: Do not go here!"}
{"text":"This was our very first of many great but unhealthy meals in Vegas. We visited New York New York and decided to eat these wonderful dogs that made Kobayashi and Joey Chestnut famous and they didn't dissappoint. They are a little small but its your typical hot dog goodness with onions, relish, sauerkraut, etc. I would definitely eat them again."}
{"text":"Very fitting to have a Nathan's inside NYNY and this location is convenient because it's located next to the arcade on the 2nd floor. I had a craving today because my family stayed at NYNY last week and I kept walking by when going to the parking garage. Service is fast here and food comes out faster than I had expected. I had a hot dog, crinkle cut fries and a slice of pepperoni pizza. Everything came out hot and tasty and the price was reasonable for being inside a Las Vegas strip casino, although it would probably be considered a little pricey for a hot dog still. I would come here again if at NYNY. I've been to other Nathan's locations in Vegas that were even more overpriced, so this seemed like a pretty good location. If you get hungry after playing at the arcade or riding the roller coaster, I would recommend coming here to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Not the cheapest place, but it beats a $30 buffet, and it's cheap in terms of Vegas food, in my opinion. I usually eat here once when I go to Vegas. It's a good, quick, and reliable place to eat. It is not in the middle of the casino so it's not too loud, but it's not quiet. The food is good if you like this kind of thing. This is the only place I've had Nathan's but it was great. I enjoy the food court seating area as well. The mini corn dogs are great."}
{"text":"$5 for a plain hot dog, which I'll admit tasted great, is nothing but obscene, even for the area. Sbarro, about 30 feet down the food court, is a far better value proposition."}
{"text":"Ate here during my last visit to Vegas and was looking forward to good food again. What a disappointment!! I ordered a regular coney with sauerkraut and onions and a side of fries and my husband ordered a calzone.  All of the food was lukewarm, the sausage was like rubber and the fries were limp. The calzone was full of tomato paste and minimal pepperoni. We won't be coming back here!"}
{"text":"pretty good. 

got our order right. no wait. quick service. food was pretty good for a hot dog place. will go back because i hate waiting for food and it seems in vegas even to get a glass of water at a stand you have to wait 15 friggin minutes."}
{"text":"Pricey.. If you're going to charge outrageous prices for a pretzel it should not be sweet, especially a Jalepeno one. And hire people that know how to smile."}
{"text":"Overrated. Dogs were small and overpriced. Also they used cheese whiz on the dogs."}
{"text":"Guys, if you're ordering anything other than hot dogs and fries, you're making a big mistake. This is Nathan's, homies - that original gangsta dog all the way from Coney Island, New York. Order what they specialize in, ignore the haters, and five-star these pimps. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"The service here was terrible. Standing in front of a cashier who was counting money for about 10 minutes. While she was doing that the cashier next to her kept looking at me then called out people behind me to take their order. After that other cashier takes those guy's order I stand in her line and wait another 10 minutes. 

I wish I took her name down so I could put it on blast.

I ordered what they were known for. The hot dog. I had it with mustard. Nothing special. Great snap to the hot dog and great flavor. I should have just eaten here than at the Luxor buffet."}
{"text":"So I was enjoying a comped roller coaster run with the bestie and found myself craving Coney..Where else to go right? Right!

This was the first time I actually got the patented fry fork so yeah I sure felt like I was catching the nostalgia. I ordered the chill dog which definitely hit the spot, but the bun did fall apart half way through. HOWEVER, that was on account of the globs of chili cheesy goodness that was my order. I would NEVER knock a point for that EVER!

All in all it definitely is reassuring to have a \"go to\" for soaking up an alcohol filled weekend. Great food, great price, and even though I'm pro Kobayashi I still eat here incognito. SSHHHHHH!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick lunch and what can you say. A couple of classic Nathan's hot dogs that go snap when you bite them, fries, and a soda are hard to beat for a fast food meal. Especially for a hot dog lover like me."}
{"text":"I came here with the intention of trying a New York hot dog. First off, the lady at the counter was practically deaf because she needed to reconfirm everything like she couldn't hear. After ordering, we sat down and when our order came, they had messed up! They apologized and got us another hot dog and let us keep the other one, so it wasn't so bad. Even though it was overpriced, we ended up scoring a free hot dog so it kind of worked it's way out.
The hot dog itself was good. It has that signature snap that many associate with New York dogs. I enjoyed it greatly and I wasn't even hungry! I consumed the whole thing haha. The pizza here was apparently really good too, though nothing special. Would I go back? Eh...It was OK but maybe not worth repeating. Especially for that price. I'd rather go to New York."}
{"text":"I really got excited to see a Nathan's stand at the Mandalay Bay. After walking thru the shark reef I was hungry so I thought the nearby food court would be a great stop!

Seeing Nathan's with it's own stand was different. Looking at their menu it was all the normal stuff, hot dogs, fries and shakes. Their prices though seemed a bit high, everything was between $5-$10 a la cart. $32 bill for 2 people to have lunch.

So we order our food and when it arrived I was really disappointed with that came compared to the price. Thin tiny hotdog, cold buns not steamed, overcooked fries and not much flavor to anything. 

My local movie theater has Nathan's hotdogs fresh, juicy large hotdogs with steamed buns. Why can't the actual resteraunt be as delicious????"}
{"text":"Why does Nathan's always sponsor hot dog eating contest? Competitors eat their hot dogs, advertise the Nathan's brand, and win cash prizes. As for myself, an empty wallet and unsatisfied pallet.

From my last trip to Vegas, I wanted to try the popular Nathan's chain. Once I saw one, I had to make a quick stop. When I went to place my order there was no line at all. It took me a few minutes to browse through the menu and decide on what I wanted to eat. I went on to place an order a chill dog with crinkle fries with the friendly cashier. After placing my order, I was handed one of those huge pagers to let me know when my order was ready. 10 minutes later I get a buzz on the pager and went to pick up my food.

For around $14, the plate looked bountiful of fast food goodness! Apparently, the meal didn't taste of a $14 quality.  The chili and hot dog tasted bland but salty. I was expecting some sort of kick from the chili, but no magic happened here. The crinkle fries were the only decent tasting items from my meal. 

I just can't see eye to eye with competitive eaters like Takeru Kobayashi and Joey Chestnut. The hype just blindsided me."}
{"text":"Nathan's hot dogs have a nice pop when you bite into them.  It was the best tasting thing i had all day partially because I hadn't eaten anything since i got off work and made the 7 drive from LA to Vegas during a Friday evening commute.  the fries were pretty terrible though, if i'm ever craving a NY Nathan's hot dog AND fries at the same time, i'd probably go to McD's next door for fries and Nathan's for the hot dog.  also, it was pretty pricey for a meal combo, about 12 bucks and that didnt even include a drink"}
{"text":"I think the 2.5 star rating for this place is a bit unfair. I thought it was decently good. I ordered the classic hot dog with sauerkraut and grilled onions. I thought it was a very good hot dog. The service isn't always the fastest, but that can be expected for a busy place like the MGM food court. Also, $6 is a bit pricey for a hot dog, but again it's the MGM food court. All things considered, it's not a bad option."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteak I ever had. Soo juicy and cook to perfection. The sandwich is pretty big and filling. I will definitely eat at Nathan's for Philly cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"Sub-par food, not worth the pricing. If you wan't mediocre food you could have just went to the Subway next door for half the price. At least you know what you are getting building your sandwich! 

Haven't really eaten at Nathan's Famous before even though it's a chain and after trying their food, will not recommend. Though the hot dogs are longer than normal, they are still hot dogs cheap food shouldn't be $13! Slathered in chili and cheese, taste is what you would expect. Where they really screwed up is their french fries.

I can say that this place has the most disgusting french fries I've eaten at a fast food  chain. They are bland and soggy, everything you do not wan't in a fry. A friend described them as potato mush in wavy caterpillar form.

You have been warned. :("}
{"text":"No ice in the soda fountain. Pizza took 20min to get; it cost $20 and was the same size and tasted like a $5 Little Caesar pizza."}
{"text":"This Nathan's location is located inside the New York New York hotel. We ordered 1 hot dog, 2 chili cheese dogs with cheese fries, and 2 large lemonades. The food was good. I loved the fries, both were good (bacon & cheese) (chili and cheese). The hot dogs were tasty and the orangeade and lemonade I got were good too. I would go back if I lived in Vegas."}
{"text":"$6.50 for a hotdog is ridiculous ... Hiding the prices by not playing any prices on the menu to surprise you with the bill is dishonest. PUT YOuR MENU PRICES on the MENU!!!!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment from a real dog. This is like chewing on a piece of rubber which costs $9.  The cheese is the liquid fake cheese. It's not worth eating. Just stop!  Do yourself a favor n skip this place."}
{"text":"i didnt like this place one bit.  service was slow! seriously, how long does it take to get a hot dog ready for a customer? lets try 10 mins!!! and to top it off, the hot dog wasnt that good. Costco is better, by far. Pizza and stromboli was garbage. Philly cheesesteak, wasnt worth eating the whole thing. both food and customer service was horrible."}
{"text":"Nathan ' s is an okay stop, but the bacon is VERY salty. Also the hot dogs that they sell are undersized and they are dry and not juicy unlike other hot dog stands. Also they are very pverpriced. 25-ish bucks for a kids meal, bacon cheese dog and bacon cheese fries which are very flaky. 3.50 for WATER! very overpriced. Finally, I think that you should go to the other neighboring restraunts  quick are 20-39 steps away like Johnny Rockets or Pan Asian or Subway."}
{"text":"Paying 25$ for 2 hotdogs and fries, that are just as good or should I say standard, as the ones you can have at casino Royale for 2,5$ a piece, feels like getting ripped off. 

Food was good, prices was horrible!"}
{"text":"Why is this place famous again?? Or is that self proclaimed. Im not saying it is BAD, but Im not saying it is GOOD either. The hot dogs are thin - I like a PLUMP doggy! It's your basic WIENER, no frills, no thrills."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with this place. I love Nathan's and have had plenty of great experiences with them, however this location was not good. 
Probably a little naive of me to expect a quality hot dog in the MGM Grand.

The dog was rubbery and the bun was stale. I'd stick to the Nathan's in the Airport!"}
{"text":"Expect to pay airport or theme park prices here.  Nathan's is a quality dog, on par with Boar's Head, but this location's service is mediocre at best.  The chili dogs left me regretting I had not gone with just a plain dog with mustard.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I wasn't disappointed but was also not extremely impressed. Overall it was an alright mall-type experience. I would recommend unless you REALLY want a hot dog in Las Vegas that you eat something else instead ..."}
{"text":"Stopped off for gas and seen a huge sign for cheeseburgers so of course I was asked to head on inside and grab one.

A cheeseburger was 5.75 and it was big. It tasted as if it just came off the BBQ like flame broiled but I didn't see her doing that so my second guess is liquid smoke ? It was a tasty burger but was a bit dry.

Didn't get to pick toppings it came with onions, pickle and a bit of ketchup. 

If I ever do go back I would ask for mustard and mayo to make it less dry."}
{"text":"This seems to be as close as I can get to an original Nathan's dog lately since it's been a while since I've been back out east.  Still, whenever I stay at the MGM, I tend to find myself here at least once scarfing down a dog.

Can't really complain too much about the food court stand.  Everything for the most part is cooked when you order it.  The fries and rings are always hot and crispy.  The Cheese-steaks are decent as well.  Still tastes a bit off from what I remember back east, however it still provides the same artery clogging affects."}
{"text":"Came here to eat on my lunch break, very delicious sandwich just way overpriced. Other than it was good!"}
{"text":"I will admit, gross as it is, that I am a big fan of the hot dog.  And I think it's pretty well known that, on a national level, no one does a dog quite like Nathans.  Period.  They're the best.

I know they have other stuff going on there, but really if I'm at Nathan's I don't want a burger or chicken nuggets.  I want a darned hot dog and some fries.  Better yet, I want a chilicheesedog and some fries.  It doesn't get better than that.  I don't know what else to say - if you're in the market for some mystery meat in a tube, this place is the boss."}
{"text":"Got a chilli cheese dog,  fries and a LG lemonade for almost $20 not worth it at all.  It just taste like chilli in a CAN,  fries were good and lemonade is too sweet. PINKS hot dog are so much better and cheaper at planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"It is what it is. Good Hotdog  add kraut and onions. Nothing to complain about. And then there's the fries."}
{"text":"Nathan's hot dogs are the epitomy of what a hot dog should be. Even though I was only able to get to the NY NY in Las Vegas to try, I still would like to trek to the East Coast to Coney Island to visit the original. The store bought Nathan's still cannot hang with ones bought from an actual Nathan's stand though.

One of the first things you notice is that when you bite into it the casing 'pops'. This is awesome. Additionally, their hot dogs are really beefy tasting and juicy. Very delicious! This is all before even putting a topping on it, which it doesn't really need cause the hot dog can be eaten and savored on it's own merits. Nathan's hot dogs are at the apex of the hot dog world and are what all other hot dogs are to be measured by."}
{"text":"Beware of the chicken cheese steak! i should have known better than to order it since I am from Philly. Awful, didnt ev en eat it and tossed it. big huge gagging chunks of undercooked chicken. Makes you gag. absolutely terrible. fries were excellent! but was disaapointed to waste money on chicken cheesesteak, quite pricy."}
{"text":"Had hotdogs here before a show. I thought they were too expensive for the quality of the regular hotdogs. Two hotdogs and a large diet drink was over $17.I have had better hotdogs elsewhere and would likely not go back."}
{"text":"Nothing better then having Nathan's right there in side the casino!
Nice dog in between hot streaks on the blackjack tables.

But 

$8 for a plan dog & Lemonaide 
I don't know about that'"}
{"text":"Holy crap. Do not get the corn dog meal. It's more than twice the price of a regular hot dog combo, which at first seems ok since you get 2 corn dogs, but look at the size of each corn dog. I don't have huge hands, but each corn dog is about the size, maybe a little smaller, than my index finger. At like $13-$14 with tax you feel totally ripped off. I actually thought I got some kind of kiddie meal mixed in with my real meal. I added a photo of the corn dogs next to my finger separate from this review."}
{"text":"It was different, but good different. Whenever i get chicken strips from a fast food joint, i expect them to be ground up chicken meat with some sandy breading.  These though, they were hot, actual chicken, with breading that was seemed to be somewhat real. The special sauce provided was a typical special sauce, but still delicious. The fries also tasted really fresh, and real. It was an overall new experience.  It was a good, quick, cheapish bite to eat while staying at the monte carlo."}
{"text":"Just in case I'm wrong, this review is for the Nathan's in the Fashion Show mall.

Pros: The krinkle cut fries were lightly crispy and not oily.

Cons: The hot dog was very plain and ordinary.  The jalepeno pretzel was dry on the bottom and rubbery on top.

I hope this isn't representative of all Nathan's."}
{"text":"Our first time trying Nathan's and first time eating at the Luxor. There were 2 crew members behind the counter, after 20 seconds of waiting, we were \"greeted\" by this guy. Blank stare. Nothing. Didn't say \"hi\", \"how can i help you\", etc.. NONE OF THAT! If you're having a bad day at work atleast fake a greeting. It felt like we were talking to a vending machine. No conversation, but the food/drink will arrive after you pay. Never coming back. Peace out!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick breakfast.  Reasonable prices.  Had the scrambled eggs, came with potatoes and toast. Added 2 sausage links. Good food, very filling."}
{"text":"Didn't get the famous hot dogs and such, but the grilled chicken caesar salad is to die for. It's a huge portion of salad and the chicken looked a little suspect but it was juicy and seasoned enough for me. YUM!!!!! 

On another visit, I tried the krispy chicken sandwich and fries. THe sandwich was O.K. I added cheese and onions to it because it only comes with lettuce and tomatoes. I didn't care for the fries. They are too thick (wide) and crinkled.  But I still enjoyed them enough to get through the sandwich."}
{"text":"If I could leave a negative star I would. This place OVERCHARGED my account for something as petty as a soft drink. I would definitely avoid this spot at all costs as they have scammed me. The proof is in the reviews.

AVOID AND DON'T."}
{"text":"Another Nathan's in Vegas (see New York New York Nathans' review.  I still got to say, nothing wrong with a $5 tasty dog in Vegas.  That's cheap eats on  the strip, and no reservation required either.  And a Nathan's dog is a very tasty dog any day of the week by me.  If you want a cheap meal, or some drunken donuts, Nathan's could quench your hot dog thirst for sure.  Enjoy.

Some people like the chili cheese dog, and I do too, but I also enjoy a straight up dog with some relish and ketchup.  I would recommend one o each.  The fries are whatever, I don't eat many fries, but the dogs . . .

Hints, you got to ask them if you want relish or extra onions for your dog.  They have ketchup and mustard out for you but other things are in the fridge behind the counter, so just ask."}
{"text":"I love Nathan's Dogs.  People say they are small and expensive.  I say they taste good, so why mess with the dog to bun ratio.  They are just mmm, mmm tasty.  And in Vegas on the strip, a $5 dog is actually a low cost dinner, even if you buy 3!  

You have to ask for relish, cuz they keep it in the fridge down below, not out getting warm.  And the fries are nothing special, but gimme another one of those dogs for sure."}
{"text":"A very expensive place to eat for what they offer!  I will give them the fact that their food is filling...a lot of starchy foods!

I think the reason they have high prices is due to the fact that they put out a lot of coupons.  Check a local Las Vegas magazine (i.e. at the airport, in a Subway restaurant, etc.), there is a 50% off your entire order coupon.  I used one and got 50% off 3 items and the price was still $15!

The food is descent...nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"So you're looking hot and feeling the fire in your white tuxedo. You have a bodacious babe on each arm. They're licking their lips waiting for you to roll a 7 at the craps table because that means a wild menage a trois with Dom Perignon champagne and caviar at the fanciest penthouse suite in the Venetian. You let one of the bodacious babes blow on the dice. You roll. CRAPS! You lose!

The bodacious babes leave you for the dweeb on a winning streak at the next table. You have to kill your reservation at AquaKnox, the Venetian's most exclusive restaurant. Where do you go, loser? Why, you come to the second floor food court and eat at Nathan's, of course. Yes, they have one here in the otherwise plush casino hotel. I guess the food court is for the rest of us who are too stingy to consider dropping some do-re-mi to dine at the nicer places.

I had the Chili-Cheese Dog with their standout Crinkle-Cut Fries. You know, the tray of fries with the red plastic pick on top that makes you think for a moment that you went to Sizzler's and ordered a steak. Those are kinda too good in a greasy way. The dog not so much. Look at the picture I uploaded in the gallery. Is that appetizing to you? Oh really. I guess I know which side of the railroad tracks you come from.

FOOD - 2.5 stars...a dog and those fries
AMBIANCE - 2 stars...it's a food court...what d'ya expect? a hostess with bodacious ta-ta's to take you to your plastic table?
SERVICE - 2 stars...uhhh...what?
TOTAL - 2 stars...sorry Nathan, Coney Island just called for you"}
{"text":"I don't get it. I have heard people rave about these hot dogs for years and being from the best coast I never had an opportunity to try them until now. I know east coasters, go ahead, get mad. I just was not impressed. 

I got the original dog and I thought the bun had the quality of a school cafeteria. The hot dog had a great spicy taste, I'll give you a few star credits for that, but it was not plump and it lacked the great snap I desire in a dog.

The cheese fries were mediocre at best. My BFF and I were splitting them and we didn't even finish them, which is weird because we love potatoes covered in cheese. Overall, a definite let down. 

FYI- The one I tried was located in the Venetian food court. There are several other locations throughout Vegas."}
{"text":"I stopped here between my two flights for work for a quick bite and received my order of chili cheese fries very quick, and with unsatisfactory customer service. When I got a chance to open the box to eat them I found this.

1) burnt fries
2) tasteless chili and cheese \"sauce\"
3) overwhelming salt flavor
4) almost a stale texture to the fries

Go to jersey mikes right next to it. Please save yourself from this place!"}
{"text":"Don't go out of your way to eat here. It's fine for a small snack while you're shopping, but if you want a good hot dog, the Pinks over at Planet Hollywood beats the dog piss out of Nathans."}
{"text":"Walking down the Vegas Strip sober? Nope that does not happen...my friends and I had to sober ourselves up at Nathan's to be able to ride the rollercoaster at New York New York. Words of wisdom: Do not ride a rollercoaster drunk and full of greasy food.

The hotdog was mediocre, as well as, the fries and service. We had all our numbers on the table and one of the workers rudely said \"Okay put it in front so we can see.\" Well, excuse me. Definitely not a place to hit up! There are so many other eateries around."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a good hot dog. Nathan's dogs are famous. All beef dogs, the original location in Coney Island.
The location I visited was in Vegas airport. 
The dogs were good and the bun fresh and warm.
My only complaint is they give out those stupid mustard packets.
I hate those, tear them the wrong way and you have a mustard strip on your shirt.
It would not be to much to have a dispen.
Other than that the dogs were delicious."}
{"text":"I'd have to say the best thing they have are nachos and chilli cheese fries. Hot dogs? Eh, pass...

I only went here because I was tired of walking on the strip and hungry in my hotel room. The food was expensive, but I'm not surprised. I'm in Vegas...

I'd probably only come back for their fries or nachos. Other then that, I'm definitely eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"This chain went down hill quick in Las Vegas.  1st the hot dog, which was usually great, was given to me in a near staled bun and over cooked hot dog.  But the best thing this place use to offer was their hot wings, but these guys changed the original wings to Kenny Rodgers Buffalo wings! Those Kenny Rodger wings are horrible.  Sorry Nathan's it was good while it lasted."}
{"text":"This Nathans is the only good thing going for the horrible Luxor hotel.  The hotdogs are tasty with a great snap to them.  But the chicken wings are the bomb! They have a slight spice to them, crispy and are always tender and not over cooked or dryed. Perfection.  The Phillychesse steak is also a good choice if its your thing."}
{"text":"crinkle cut fries + melted cheddar cheese + fresh bacon = WHOA MY GOD. 

sides of wings, chicken tenders....wooooooooooo. 

the hotdogs look pretty cool too but i'm pretty tough on hotdogs since i can get me some dogs from Pink's. 

ah, great place for some late late night eats."}
{"text":"I went there in late night and the food was well made and surprisingly good.

The beef in burger was so fresh and juicy. It's not too salty so tasted great.
The buns were fresh made, super soft and warm.

The only thing it could have been better is that they don't have pickle."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab some quick grub.  

The kiddos liked it.  We ordered some hot dogs, chili cheese fries and drinks for them.  There is also a chicken strip place right next door my little cutie pie wanted.  For $4.95 he got two freshly made chicken strips! 

I got my green tea latte across the way from Starbucks and I was good to go."}
{"text":"I'd never eat here again.  The only reason I did in the first place is b/c I needed something fast in order to make the Ka show I was attending.  Like ppl have already said, it wasn't very fast and the dog itself was overcooked and the fries were soggy.  Why this place is \"famous\" is beyond me!"}
{"text":"I transferred flight here on my way back to Seattle. There were only 5 to 6 people in the line so I decided to get in. There were many options so I ordered No. 15 crispy chicken sandwich and No. 4 corn dogs. It took longer than I thought to get my food but as long as the food was hot and made to order, I was fine. When I got on the plane, I was so excited to open the bag. The corn dogs were absolutely delicious! Put a little bit ketchup and mustard. It's good to go. For the chicken sandwich, after the first bite, I was shocked by how hard the outer crispy batter was and it was hard to swallow. Then I had a second bite, the chicken tasted chewy. How did they make it like that? To be honest, I had never had the crispy chicken sandwich like that before. I was so afraid to get sick so I threw the rest of the food away. I didn't feel well on my stomach on the flight afterwards.  

Stay away the crispy chicken sandwich and stick with the hot dogs!"}
{"text":"Pretty good hot dogs that are a bit overpriced is what you'll get if you visit one of the many Nathan's Famous locations on the Las Vegas strip. 

Stopped by the New York New York location with friends after I was told by one of my friends that the hot dogs were good...and good they were. I got a chili cheese dog that was about the size of an average hot dog. Lots of flavor came from the link with a nice crunch from the outer layer when biting into it. The chili was decent as well. To top it off was a liquid cheese that didn't add nor take away from the hot dogs flavor. I do prefer shredded cheese but you work with what's available.

This cost $8 and some change. Pretty steep for the portion especially when you can grab a Vegas foot long hot dog with chili and cheese within the $2 to $4 range if that's anything to compare portion wise. However, Nathan's hot dogs are a lot more flavorful which will leave you wishing it was bigger for the cost. I actually wanted another one but wasn't going to fork out another $8 or so. At least not during the same visit.

Nathan's is convenient especially when it comes to late night eats that are fast to get to within the hotel to help ease any alcohol consumption. With that being said, I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't pay the cost again sometime in the future. Great taste but needs to ease on the prices.

Dinner 8/20/2016"}
{"text":"Love the food at Nathan's, their all beef hot dogs always hit the spot! Unfortunately, today my visit was not the best. Maria was helping my family and I and the menu shows $4 for a bottle of water, this location has two different water options. Not both of them are $4 and it doesn't specify this anywhere on the menu. After picking up the \"more expensive, undocumented water\" Maria began to rudely explain that this water was more expensive and not on the menu, she was talking down to us, rolling her eyes and we also overheard her talking about us after we had paid and left. Very POOR customer service towards us and our situation. I definitely will not be back to this place because of the type of service my family recieved. Would give zero stars if it were an option. Please update your menu and retrain employees."}
{"text":"Went back the next day with my son and mom and the fries were still specatular.  This time I had a stromboli and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Staying here at the NY-NY Hotel & Casino, last night after my wife and I arrived, checked in,  we wanted a quick bite to eat after being on the road a few hours and before we hit the town. After being highly recommended and being in the hotel we came to Nathan's Famous to experience the east coast legend.

(Trumpet please-Whah-whah-whah)  Disappointed... yes, the hype was over the top.
Although it was not a bad tasting hot dog, I've surely didn't get my monies worth here.

Since it's a hot dog, I figured I probably wouldn't be back so I thought kill two bids with one stone and got the Bacon Hot dog covered with their famous chili.
Ok I'll give them the fact that it truly is a Coney Island/Board walk/beach style hot dog and I shouldn't expect more, but I expected flavor that was killer. Nope, tasted just like what I get from Zack's on the beach at Huntington Beach CA. A beach hot dog. The chili was pretty much average and had a good flavor, but nothing to write home about.
I've tasted better at Costco, really, and cheaper.

The onion rings were not good at all... period!

The garlic knots were actually very good! Bite size would have been better instead of the size of a roll.   

Atmosphere was a \"B+\" because I enjoyed the music they played, that 50's 60' Doo Whop style east coast thing. 

Over all we payed for the name not the great food.

I don't need to come back and try again before leaving, I'll just find me a Costco on the way home if I feel a hot dog hankering coming on.

{"text":"It was our last meal before leaving the Palazzo hotel and the group decided to just go for the good ole' quick, affordable food court.  Mind you this was hard to find. I suggest that when staying at the Palazzo, get off on the second floor where the shops are at and go to the left side of the fork. The side where Godiva is at. Go past the mini plaza where you see Otto and the store Pandora. Once you see the pretzel place go left and a small section of the food court will be visible.

Nathan's hot dogs caught my eye and I decided to try the chili dog with sauerkraut. I also ordered the fries with cheese and real bacon bits on top.  Well, if I could do it over I'll just get the hotdog with the sauerkraut. The chili part was just average and sorta tasted canned. As for the fries they were good. The potatoes were brown and crispy on the edges and the bacon was a nice addition. I wish the cheese was not the \"nacho-ish\" kind. (again, it tasted like it was canned.) Overall it was ok."}

We stopped by here after the Bjork show at the Pearl and were considering getting a late night dog, but we just couldn't pull the trigger.

{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas on family trip and stopped to try this place. Nathan's chili cheese hotdog was small. I prefer that they would have used the jumbo size hot dog for this. Price alone for this one was $7.98!! The footlong was $12. Too pricey for the amount and size. Was it good? Yes! The bacon, cheese fries was ok. French fries were too mushy. The philly cheese steak was ok. Not as good as Charlie's. The place is clean the staff friendly. It's s decent meal for fast food. It will cost you! Total was &45 did not include drinks!!"}

We stopped by on Thursday, July 11th & Friday, July 12th. Though we gravitated towards the familiar McDonald's for a sandwich, Nathan's line was shorter, so we decided to try them out.

I got the Sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin, add bacon the first morning. I figured they would just add bacon to the sandwich, but they gave me a good amount on the side. I think like 5 strips. I believe it was an extra $2 to add bacon, so the amount justified the cost. The second morning, I got the same sandwich without adding bacon. I believe the sandwich was over $5, but less than $6. I can't really remember as I didn't document any of these meals. Both days, the sandwiches hit the spot! I liked that the cheese was melted on the egg and not all over the muffin as I could just eat the inside of the sandwich if I wasn't super hungry.

Nathan's offered a great alternative to McDonald's sausage egg mcmuffin. Plus, we didn't have to wait in their ridiculously long line!"}
{"text":"I don't know what caused me to think of reviewing this place now.  I joined Yelp several months ago, and dined here back in what must have been September 2007.  

I guess that fact is I still remember this experience vividly.  

Ever stay at the MGM and have to spend an entire night vomiting in / sitting on the toilet in your hotel room?  Well, I have.  And the only thing I had to eat that day?  A hot dog and cheese fries from Nathan's at the MGM.  

All food poisoning aside, the food still tasted like shit.  I don't see how anyone has ever eaten one of those hot dogs and thought \"this tastes good!\".  Those are probably the same people eating at a McDonald's every day, and the ones that build the hype machine around Nathan's annual 4th of July cattle call on Coney Island.  

And the employees that worked here were FAR less than enthused about their career path.  Out of the group of six people I was with, I was the only one to eat at Nathan's.  The rest of the group, all five of them, got their food before me.  I think it had something to do with the cheese sauce they put on my fries, which unbeknownst to me at the time, would likely be the cause of my food poisoning later.  Anyway, if I worked here I would seriously contemplate self immolation or starting up a promising career in the drug game (Las Vegas is a great place for drugs, I hear).  

I guess the one positive out of this is my friends get to tell the story of me running for a trash can in hotel room and vomiting into it in the hallway, as our bathroom was being occupied by a female at the time.  That and I didn't vomit on my flight back to St. Louis the next day."}
{"text":"I love this place but your manager/check out girl has the personality of a wall. She seems like she doesn't want to be there, which I can understand because it's work but still... Be a little more chipper lady."}
{"text":"Nathan is the best destination for a quick and good breakfast at the Luxor hotel, and nearby Excalibur and Mandalay. You get about 8 main options of items like scrambled eggs, Belgian Waffle and others with side options like sausages, brown potatoes which are like Swiss ones and delicious, bacon  and fresh and real good coffee cups. It goes for around $17 for two people."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for something quick and easy before a show and Nathan's was it. I had the bacon cheddar foot long hot dog. It was hot and gooey but not much else. Probably not going to go back unless it was the only option."}
{"text":"Hot dog was decent.  Overpriced for what it was.  New York New York shut off the gas to do construction, so all they served were hot dogs and pizza.  Fries should have come with the two hot dogs I ordered, but they couldn't make them.  There was no discount, and was charged like I ordered fries."}
{"text":"I love Nathan's hotdogs. I used to go to Coney Island just for Nathan's - So I was shocked to see the menu and prices at Bally's ( 1/4 lb is the smallest @ $8). Still the same taste but the wait of 15 minutes from two girls there - Ms. Slow and Ms. Grumpy - never again.

I'd say walk 15 minutes to New York New York instead because the Nathan's there have better options and you'll save $$ and faster service than this joint.  (located on same 2nd floor where the roller coaster and game arcade are)"}
{"text":"This is the Nathan's Famous at the Grand Canal Shoppes food court at the Venetian Hotel & Casino.  
We went for the Arthur Treacher's Fish n Chips selection which was decent and maybe about even with Long John Silver's.  That's saying that it's alright for fast food but not too worthy of a good fish n chips.  

They did have the novel approach of using a pager so they wouldn't have to yell across what's a pretty loud food court here."}
{"text":"A quick bite before heading off to our show, but a small naked hot dog on a bun for $5.98? You must be kidding me! Of course my wife who showed up a few minutes later also ordered a hot dog, and she received her's with relish and sauerkraut, they asked her what she'd like on hers. I thought, maybe the extra condiments are off to the side like most places. But no, only bottles of ketchup and mustard at each table, no relish or onions anywhere in sight. So I just added mustard and left it at that. Much better then the Nathan's you get at Sam's Club I'll admit; grilled not steamed, but hardly worth $5.98."}
{"text":"I'm actually reviewing the location inside the food court at the venetian... is this the right one?

CHICKEN WINGS AND FRIES! The wings are really really good. Crispy golden with great flavor. I bit of spice to it. Get ranch."}
{"text":"This review is for their breakfast only. We ordered our breakfast from here two days in a row because we loved their pancakes and applewood smoked bacon. In addition to Alicia's friendly service...she was absolutely courteous and polite. She really made us feel welcome. Other ladies were great too! A very friendly group! We will be back possibly tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"I dont know which address is the one at the Las Vegas Hilton off the strip, outside the convention center, thats the one I am reviewing.

One word: pukey
Cannot understand the rave about their hot dogs and \"the snap\" what snap? The one were your stomach tells you to stop putting this toxic dump of a dog inside it? 
First, no matter what item I get from here, its cold or lukewarm. Their dogs suck, I buy he-blew internationals that taste 1000 times better at costcos. Hell costcos dogs are as good, or bad.
I ordered crispy chicken sandwich to change things up a bit, my goodness it was worse than anything I have eaten, tempurate, quality, taste, and appearance wise
Sure their small wavy cut thumb fries look cute and are somewhat edible, but this whole establishment sucks ass.
When you are at a trade show and can't decide what to get from this mini-food court, do NOT get this crap, move 10 spaces to the left and get sbarros pizza (not that that will be getting a michelin star anytime soon but compared to this it's gourmet)
P.s. And shit aint cheap yet gross!!!!"}
{"text":"sleepwalking customer service here.
Ordered 2 combos, they forget fries on 1, and drink on the other.
The guy refilling my lemonade was friendly, but the cashier not even offered an apology, and felt like she was gonna verify with my receipt even though i just ordered and paid like, what 5 minutes ago?
Their food is very heavy, greasy, and not all that.
Fries suck, period.
hot dog ordered with bacon and cheese, bacon looked old and charred, dog was so-so.
Prices ridiculous, combos top off at $15 bucks. Tried to get a cheap meal still ended up paying 35 bucks for 2 combos. 
They dont cook the dogs on order, you get ones cooked and put aside. Shit subway next door must be better than this.
The crispy fried chicken sandwich is better, but skip the fries so heavily greased and crap tasting/soggy its pathetic."}
{"text":"I have never had  Nathan's Famous hotdog before.  When I walked past this location after a long day at a conference I decided to give it a try.  

I am from the Midwest and used to the Chicago style dogs so that is maybe why I didn't like this style.  

The dog was the size of a highlighter, maybe even skinnier, they didn't have relish to put on it.  I went with jalapenos and onions to dress my dog.  The crinkle fries weren't anything special just the standard frozen crinkle fries.  

The service wasn't the best at this location, food I didn't care for, the only positive thing was that they did have beer I could use to wash down the bland dog."}
{"text":"Small portions of food, but a descent quality. Clean area and good customer service. Would not reccomend if you want a big meal."}
{"text":"I read a few of the reviews and it surprised me that hardly anyone got JUST a hotdog. There is literally nothing wrong with these hotdogs, they have a natural casing and come with most of the hotdog necessities (sauerkraut, relish and onions). Don't come for anything but, is my advice and you'll be ok!"}
{"text":"I ordered the foot long chili cheese dog. Terrible. Their food is normally not bad, but this one looked and tasted like it was made a few days earlier. I dont expect great food from nathans, but I also dont expect food that most places would have thrown away hours earlier"}
{"text":"Surprisingly excellent Asian salad with chicken. The chicken was very moist. Ample portion size."}
{"text":"Footlong hot dog with large crinkle cut fries. Expensive but delicious. Nothing fancy.  Great service."}
{"text":"Ugghhhhh..... Just.... Ugh.

I'm sorry, that's all I can say about this place. I work at Mandalay Place, and I decided (against my better judgement) to walk over to the food court place in the Luxor casino.  

The girl that rang me up was nice enough, even gave me the employee discount :) I just showed her my Urban discount card! I thought that was pretty cool. But that's pretty much where all coolness ends. 

I ordered the bacon cheese hot dog. Pretty simple, right? Take a hot dog, throw some melted cheese and bacon on it, and voila!! Doneski...... You would think.

She hands me one of those coasters that light up and vibrate when you have a wait at a restaurant. Ummm, wtf. I thought this was a food court, and all we are serving are hot dogs here.... Really?

After a 10 minute wait (waaaaaay too long for a damn hot dog in my opinion), my coaster goes off. I pick up my dog, then walk over to the employee break room to grab a soda and eat.

First bite, and the hot dog completely FALLS APART. Like, bun completely crumbles, the strips of bacon come flying out, and cheese sauce goes everywhere. So messy, so gross. Even with my discount, I paid almost $6 for some lame-ass hot dog that fell apart the instant i bit into it. Very disappointing, indeed."}
{"text":"Does anybody know what fries taste like?!  This place sucked ASS!!!  Before I go on, I like Weinershnietzel, Hot dog on a Stick and damn Costco dogs...I'm not a picky eater.  But this hot dog place SUCKED ASS!!! I can't express this enough.

I ordered a chili cheese dog, w/ cheese fries and bacon.  I got a plain hot dog, a bacon hot dog, w/ cheese fries... ?? okay.  That's fine, it was probably a long night for them; the lady in front of us sweared she handed them a $20, and the cashier gave her  $1 in change, who knows the customer seemed shady herself...ANYWAYS....they corrected my order and now we're good again...

It tasted like they cooked the fries in a month old oil for 14 hours; the fries we're horrible!!  Let me remind you I'm not picky, it was just that bad!  The hot dog, the runny cheese even the bacon!  I thought I could just pick off the bacon but that too was apparently fried in the same vat. So much for a quick bite to eat.  I've never been able to make myself throw up, and that day I WISHED I was bulimic. Gross."}
{"text":"Simple, okay pricing. Flavors are what you'd expect using basic stuff put together minus spices. 

It won't wow you. We got breakfast. Scrambled eggs, potatoes, and toast for me. Eggs tasted like nothing, no spices. Potatoes not crispy, very chewy; probably sat out in oil for too long, toast was not crispy. 

Compatriots got pancakes and the omelette. Again no spices with the omelette, but the pancakes were okay. Then again if you mess up pancakes then that's your bad haha. 

Anyway, most things need a condiment tray and aren't heavy tastewise on their own. Plus preparation may suffer if people haven't been rolling through. Just bear in mind the food may have been sitting there for a while so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Do not come here late at night as the wait is ridiculous! You can't blame them though as everyone is hungry and everyone wants to eat cheaply. With the exception of McDonalds, this is about as cheap as you are going to eat late at night unless you go off strip to a late night buffet or one of those $6.95 late night meals. All in all, the hot dogs and fries are great as well as the philly cheesesteak. They do make everything to order so you know you are getting fresh food. The prices are not that bad but again, it is in a hotel in Vegas. What more can you expect?"}
{"text":"I've only eaten at the New York New York Nathan's once. The MGM Nathan's is usually where I go to get Nathan's since I usually stay at that hotel. They're pretty much the same in business, service and quality.

Nathan's is good for your easy, fast, cheap food in Vegas. It definitely beats the average hot dog. The fries are 'meh'. I can go without those. I've had their wings before and those are ok. Stick with the hot dogs. It's what they're famous for anyway.

If you just lost a bunch of money to gambling or you're on a low budget coming to Vegas. This works for you."}
{"text":"Omg, wish I could remember what we ordered from here. Only found a wrapper in our room trash can the next morn. Supposedly Faye M ate here after a drunk night at LAX. Lol. 
Found the hotdog wrapper and no food so 5 stars because she ate it all :) good times.
Visited Aug 2011"}
{"text":"Have you had too much tequila? Do you need to absorb said taquila? Nathan's has a nice footlong chili cheese dog that will help you with that. I don't think you can beat a hot dog, with your favorite toppings when you've been drinking or when you're at an arcade. Nathan's will cover both options for you. They're a little pricey, but my belly said thank you after a day of drinking entirely too many tequila shots followed by beer chasers."}
{"text":"Thanks to fellow yelper, Daniel S., I found out about this Nathan's located in the food court of Aliante Hotel and Casino. On my first visit the employees were friendly, helpful and got my order to me in a fair amount of time. The second visit I was the only customer yet it took a frustratingly long time to get my order and there were 3 employees working that seemed to care more about talking to each other. The prices are not bad for being inside a casino and the food court area offers a good amount of seating. 

I've never been a huge fan of Nathan's hot dogs. The best one I ever had was surprisingly from the snack bar at the drive-in on Carey. The bun on the hot dog I had at this Aliante location was nice and soft, but I didn't care for the taste of the hot dog itself or the watery/soupy chili. I could only eat a couple bites and was done. The chili was just not good and certainly not \"famous\" if you ask my tastebuds. One thing my tastebuds did like was the Crinkle-Cut Cheese Fries I've now had a couple times. The fries were perfectly crisp and there was a fair amount of liquid gold on top that not only tasted great, but didn't make the fries soggy at all. You can get a good sized portion of cheese fries for around $3 with tax and they have draft beer for $2 to complete your meal which is very reasonable given the location. They also currently have a promotion for a draft beer and hot dog for $5. I'll pass on the hot dogs in the future however will stop by at times for cheese fries."}
{"text":"Overpriced but convenient location next to the New York New York arcade. Not much seating, but if you are lucky to get a booth, hold onto it, eat the overpriced food while the kids run around the arcade. Location is everything. Timing is too, but that's a whole different conversation! 

Get ready to pay $7.00 for a hotdog, $15.00 for a meal. Empire State of Mind yo!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs for breakfast??? HOT DOGS FOR BREAKFAST!!!

I hadn't eaten at a Nathan's since Coney Island in '06, so I was understandably nostalgic. Grocery Nathan's on the grill taste delish, especially on sale, but it can't quite replicate the yum factor of getting the real thing.

Unfortunately, the Vegas version isn't close to the real thing either, especially since they don't offer the vaunted \"onion sauce\" that makes a New York dog a NEW YORK DOG. (Don't worry, sauerkraut and dijon mustard still available)

$5 for a single hot dog is highway robbery; 2 for $10 gets you fries on the side. Breakfast menu is available but you might as well get that at the MDonald's next door."}
{"text":"My niece was hungry after arcading for a while and couldn't wait for the family to go to a buffet so we grabbed a quick slice of pizza and a drink for her. Maybe it's cause we weren't expecting much but the pizza was out and hot extremely fast as it ended up being really good. The sauce had the perfect sweetness to it and the cheese was melted just right. I prefer a thinner crust but the medium thickness on Nathan's pizza was just fine. Also, try the orangade. I thought it was going to taste like Sunkist but it kid of reminded me more of an Orange Julius drink. I would go back for a cheap fast bite."}
{"text":"The food was good but the absolutely RUDE service ruined the experience. After all the people behind me in line had already received their food, I asked the cashier if mine was almost ready. They forgot! So after waiting 15-20 for my food, I complained and the employee couldn't care less. She actually argued with me and said that's the normal wait time. Worst guest service ever!"}
{"text":"This Nathan's is in the food court of the Palms casino. Went here a couple of times during my last trip and had a good experience. Nathan's hot dogs are very consistent, so eating here is a no brainer. I had the hot dog and fries and also tried the Philly cheese steak.... Yum! If you are in the mood for a good hot dog, don't be afraid to stop by here. Good service and the people were friendly."}
{"text":"$4.50 for a hot dog with nacho cheese all over it. I was dumb enough to think that the picture of they showed was a cheese dog while in actuality the picture was with sour kraut. I was dissapointed that the cheese they used was just nacho cheese in a little hot dog. I give this place 2 stars becasue the hot dog had some potential but for the price I cant really justify that. I would rather eat at pinks and pay $7.

Sorry but your hot dogs just suck for the price atleast places like weinerschnitzel knows they arent the best and thats how they price it out. 

BYOB since you can bring beer and drink it anywehere."}
{"text":"I got the Philly Cheese Steak! Wow! Amazing! Took a little while to prepare but I find that most of the time that's a good thing as it's being made fresh and it hasn't been sitting there for a couple of minutes.

A little pricey I guess but you get what you pay for, and as long as you're not getting these all day everyday all is good. 

Service was okay, nothing special so the 4 stars are strictly just for the actual taste of the food! Well prepared, fresh and worth the wait in the end! Do it! Go! Do it right now, go try it! Drop everything, you know you want a cheese steak!"}
{"text":"If you looking for a light good dinner. Then Nathan's it is. They are famous for their New York style chili dogs. I always order 2 since they aren't jumbo size. The dogs have just a special flavor to them."}
{"text":"Had breakfast, biscuits and gravy with sausage. Scrambled eggs. Gravy was cold. Food was decent otherwise. 

One of the cheaper options. Good portions. But cold food seems to be a common problem here at the Luxor."}
{"text":"Dry fries and chicken club was ok. Meat was pretty dry and all around bland. Had to buy dipping sauces for a $1 to give it some life. All in all, too expensive for the poor quality and lack of flavors. Will not return."}
{"text":"Nothing famous about these hot dogs.
The good: With the super-sized price of the roller coaster at NYNY, you get a coupon for a discounted famous experience.
For 7 bucks, I got a hotdog, fries and a drink. Fantastic prices for Vegas.
BUT... the hot dog was average and the fries actually sucked."}
{"text":"Very slow and rude service, but the food was good.  It's also pricey for what you get, try a different place in the food court."}
{"text":"I consider french fries one of the four food groups, along with cheese, red wine and sushi.

Super salty, crispy on the outside and served with a trident. This is the place to be at 2am when you drunkenly decide to forsake your nutritious eating routine."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Nathan's Hot Dog!  Yet I was so disappointed to in my hard bun and hot dog that was less than fresh.
Just take a peek at your product if you are taking it to go, so you're not disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night bite and because I was in Vegas could not help but want a hot dog. So they're not the $1 foot longs on downtown, but for a little over $4 I got a good grilled hot dog with chili, cheese and sauerkraut.  You could tell the staff was tired. Perhaps it was close to closing time. They didn't have much energy out enthusiasm, but it was late.  

The dog was good. Not great.  But it beat going to bed hungry."}
{"text":"08.10.2017

We HAD to eat here because it's Hubby's favorite hot dog brand. 

We both had an Original beef hot dog, mine with relish and sauerkraut and his with relish and onions.  The only thing I would complain about is the hot dog wasn't grilled fresh to order (MINUS 1 star). They had some pre-made hot dogs sitting on the grill. Aside from the temperature of the hot dog, the flavor was good. I liked the sauerkraut because it wasn't the strong and sour taste I remember sauerkraut having when I was growing up. 

Hubby and I shared chili cheese fries and they were the perfect side to our hot dogs. The thick crinkle cut fries were crisp and the chili and melted cheese on top were delicious. Definitely a large enough serving for more than two people to share if it's not your main meal. 

H tried their new chicken wings.  She enjoyed them because they were fried and the sauce was similar to the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce we use at home."}
{"text":"So dissatisfied. I stopped by with my husband and two kiddos and purchased hotdogs, chili cheese fries and drinks. The price was outrageous 66. Plus $$$$ ... for hot dogs!??? And to make it worse they were not anything special, the food tasted so basic, if that. As far as customer service the lady at the register was nice but the gentlemen we asked to wipe down our table had a horrible attitude. It was like it was the end of the world because we asked him to do his job?... anyhow, no I would not recommend this place. I could have eaten something way better, with better customer service, and probably for less the price."}
{"text":"I stopped at Nathan's for a quick meal before my flight out of McCarron and overall I was not impressed. I ordered a crispy chicken Caesar wrap and they told me I would have to wait for crispy chicken, which was totally fine... the problem is that even after waiting, I'm not sure I even received the right wrap. Whatever I ended up with had some kind of barbecue sauce on it and tasted very blah. I did not notice until I was already at my gate, so I couldn't get it fixed, but I was not impressed that even after waiting, my order was messed up. I won't be stopping here again."}
{"text":"Despite nothing wrong with this location, I don't really know why anyone would stop by here unless you are about to hit the MGM pool and want something quick and fast.

Why do I choose to keep coming here?  Mainly because the line is not too long and the food comes out fairly quick. Located in the busy MGM food court, Nathan's Famous is one of the chains that can be frequently found throughout the Las Vegas strip.  With other viable options here, the food here is simply not up to snuff to warrant the high cost of the mediocre product that comes out.  

Here is what I have ordered:
Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich- Everytime I have ordered this the chicken has been lukewarm and underseasoned.  I also found the bun preparation inconsistent.  Sometimes it came out a little warm and other times there was a char on the bottom.  I say go for this item if you must get something with chicken, but it has never been fully satisfying.

Sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich - An okay breakfast sandwich.  I did enjoy that the English muffin was toasted nice to get that nice crunch and the cheese melted nice and evenly with the egg.  However, the size was on the smaller side making it not very satisfying.

Perhaps because I have not actually ordered the hot dogs which Nathan's is well known for I am not giving them a fair assessment of their product.  However, I do believe if you are not able to produce a similar quality product on your other items you are better off not serving the item.

Overall, the food here at Nathan's is nothing to be excited about and definitely should not be your go to place at the MGM food court which already has so many other options."}
{"text":"i can't believe they have such low ratings.

the thought of nathan's make my mouth water! it's so tasty that you don't even need ketchup. and this is coming from a ketchup fanatic! bf and i needed something small to hold us off until dinner time. we got two hot dogs with a side of fries that had bacon bits, cheese, and well the works. now the side wasn't the absolute best we've had but it wasn't exactly the worst. [fyi. the best is still hooters called lots of tots!!!]

its like a fast food joint that is in a food court in a shopping area. what kind of service is people really expecting? you order, you get your food, you seat yourself, you clean after yourself. simple as 1 2 3!

anyways the prices were reasonable. they made our fries fresh and they weren't busy so that must of been why i'm not making any complaints. I would come back to this location if im back in vegas."}
{"text":"While the food is good for over priced bag food, but can we say way over priced! 

We went to see a show at the Luxor and my girlfriend wanted to eat afterwards so we got the basic Philly cheesesteak with frys and a Pepsi(shame no Coke) for her meal it was $24! Lesson learned. 

The cheesesteak was not that good the fries were out of a bag as I believe the sandwich. The staff wasn't friendly and to have tip jars out like this at what is a fast food restaurant how shameful!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Nathan's hot dogs after watching them on TV......

Boy did I regret wasting my money here. Super salty and ridiculously overpriced for 1 hotdog.

Would have been better off eating at McDonalds next door if you want something to eat."}
{"text":"I had the 2 Corn Dog combo (two small corn dogs, drink and fries)
The food was over priced, $10 for the combo!
The food was average at best, the fires were probably the best thing. I believe the corn dogs are pre-made/frozen.
It took quite longer than I expected to get my order.
Maybe the regular single hotdog combo for $7 is better, but I probably won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"There's nothing special about Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs.  I had the loaded chili dog; took a bite and thought, \"That's it?!\"  Now I know to just keep walking on past and find a burger joint instead."}
{"text":"Food was warm. Cheese in omelette not melted though. Don't ask for an extra slice of bread after lunch starts. Won't get it. Manager said once lunch starts nothing from breakfast can be sold."}
{"text":"Great breakfast without spending a fortune. A family of  four was $40 and we all walked away happy. The pancakes, waffles, eggs and bacon were all tasty and cooked to perfection. Surprisingly good breakfast for a place famous for hot dogs"}
{"text":"This review is only on the philly cheese steak at Nathan's at the MGM Grand Food Court.  It was a good meal - sandwich, fries, and soft drink for about $11...  I was pretty darn hungry and could barely finish this meal.  You could probably split the meal with someone else, and still be very satisfied by paying $5 bucks for half of the sandwich."}
{"text":"We were heading back to our hotel after watching The Lion King and we were both starving.  I wanted Pink's because I was craving a hot dog but we weren't sure if it was open and we didn't want to walk all the way over there just to find out it was closed.  So as we walked through NY NY we seen Nathan's and just had to stop.  Ordered the two hot dogs and fries meal, I think it was around $8, I added cheese on mine and boyfriend left his plan.  We got the crinkle-cut fries with the meal and they were good, nothing special but good. I thought the hot dog was just good too, nothing special but if you're starving and somewhat buzzed it does the job.

I guess after having Pink's nothing else compares but if you're in need of something quick stop by Nathan's."}
{"text":"24 hours! 

Service was horrible but whaddaya expect at 2am? 

I can't believe all the years living on the east coast, I never tried a Nathan's hot dog.  It's like never trying a McDonalds quarter pounder until you are in your 30s - it's THAT stupid, but I digress.  I was pleasantly surprised by how yummy this hot dog was, and this is coming from a hot dog antagonist.

Location: inside Luxor, on the 2nd floor, to the left of McDonalds"}
{"text":"Omg $50 for three hotdogs and 3 sodas... Not worth it at all. Disappointed in the lack of flavor in the chili dog, and cold fries for that kind of $ at least the movies was $5! Bonus. Not going back - chronic taco next time or a nasty Big Mac would be better. I'd welcome a case of the mcburps!"}
{"text":"Not a bad stop off in the food court area that surrounds it.  We had the 2 hot dog meal and the cheesesteak sandwich meal - which were both tasty and made fresh.  Ordering here may take a few extra minute, but it's worth the fresh made food.

Overall: B
If you are in the area and hungry for a cheaper bite on the Strip, stop off here."}
{"text":"Nathan's Famous consistently serves the same quality food, which is good if you're in for fast food type mood.

The food is decent, but obviously nothing special. This place is great for late night munchies."}
{"text":"We ate this right after a 6 hour flight from Fl, we were staying at the Luxor & were dying for something to eat so we ordered foot long hotdogs. It was hot and fresh & we had no complains. Though my boyfriend said it wasn't anything to special. French fire were super yummy though!"}
{"text":"Breakfast review. Biscuit was sitting out a long time and bacon was burnt. I know this is just fast food but still it's pricier than McDonald's and I would've preferred that sandwich."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a sandwich and when I asked about it they said it was coming. No apology nothing. Terrible service."}
{"text":"This place serves breakfast. Never again.  My $12 waffle was the worst that I have ever had.  I had to throw it away after about 2 bites.  It was thick, tasteless and discusting. I have had better at continetal breakfasts at little small hotels. I don't know about the hotdogs but breakfast, don't do it!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the staff and wait time. We waited 25mins for a hot dog and fries. I went to the counter to check the status of our food and i was ignored. When we finally got the food the bread was hard."}
{"text":"I love the Brand Nathan's I mean who doesn't. I have had Nathans at the Venetian before and it was way better but this Nathan's is in an airport so I would think that would be why. The food is still good just wasn't as fresh as I would have liked it. Love Nathans though!!"}
{"text":"Just ate here after going to see Carrot Top. First thing I've had besides water since 4pm. I ordered the chili cheese dog combo and added cheese to my fries. Including tax $21.00 I'm like dang what did I order. Took a picture after I ate half of the dog. The dog it was cold the fries were hot but soggy not crispy at all. And I was harassed in the food court seating area by some homeless guy with crazy eyes. 

I really hate that everyone sat there and watched me get harassed by this guy right after I sat down alone and did nothing. But can't blame Nathan's for that. I can blame Luxor for not having any security in the food court. 

I ate my food and hopped in a taxi after I finally found the way out. 

In the taxi stomach started turning bad.  I started sweating and praying to God I can get home quickly and be sick there, not here in the taxi cab. I got home barely in time. What ever they did to the food made me incredibly sick. Thank God I made it to my bathroom in time. 

Never going to eat here again."}
{"text":"Ehhhh Nathan's hotdogs taste better from the package made yourself. Love them that way but not at all impressive at the actual Nathan's. Have had the chili cheese foot long and plain with sauerkraut and other fixtures. Also had the crinkle fries with bacon and cheddar..... again not great. I wouldn't say I love it or hate it. They have other things but I would not be too quick to try it again unless it was what was available!"}
{"text":"Can't beat a Nathan's hot dog. :-)  paid about $10.00 for a combo. Very good and split between two."}
{"text":"Decent for a quick meal. A little pricy... i mean almost $4 for 16oz bottle of water?! But I digress.. Philly cheese steak was good. Tenders were fresh but a little too much batter. Some fries were soggy, I like mine extra crisp. Anyway for those 2 meals, onion rings, large soda and bottle of water it was $40!"}
{"text":"Located inside the second floor food court Nathans is one of the first stops. I love Nathans hot dogs. I normally just grab the dog and a drink. It is pricey but, everything on the strip cost an inflated amount. If your a casino worker you get a discount so, it cost me six dollars. The fries are addicting, my triend got them. There are no gimmicks to Nathan's. It is what it is. And it is soooooooo good. Like the In and Out of Hot dogs."}
{"text":"I was drunk, I was hungry, and a dog sounded good.

it was alright. 

I honestly can't imagine eating 68 of these things in a Competitive eating contest. 2 was enough. 

*puke*"}
{"text":"It's a tasty dog, but a bit pricey as others have mentioned. I've been to the Nathan's in other cities so I guess this is comparable in taste and price...although maybe I don't mind the cost in other cities, b/c I'm usually in an airport and fully expect them to rip me off. But come on downtown Pittsburgh - $4.00 for a hot dog with some toppings?!?! 

All in all an \"A-OK\" experience. I may or may not go there again - I really have no strong feelings about it...I guess it will depend on if I feel like splurging for a h-dog! 

If you're in the area and have an abundance of $$$ and don't mind spending it on encased meat then stop by."}
{"text":"THIS IS FOR THE LOCATION AT NY NY.

I thought it quite appropriate that my 100th review be about hot dogs.  I can't get enough of them and will eat \"dirty water\" hot dogs any day of the week.  If you put anything other than spicy mustard and onions, then you're taking away from the true hotdog experience.  I've had my fair share at ballparks and street vendors across the nation.  I have to admit that the vendors on the City's streets are probably the best I've had, specifically the ones around Union Sq since they also serve Pepsi (not all of them do).  

But back to Nathan's in Vegas.  I was walking to the Bellagio to meet some friends and realized I was hungry.  I had the coupon for B1G1F and since NY NY was connected to Excalibur, I could walk there with minimal sun exposure.  So I made my way over to have a dog.  When I got there, I was a bit disappointed.  They had spicy mustard, but no onions.  How does a hotdog stand not have onions??  Lack of onions aside, the dog itself was yummy and the bun nice and soft.  Unlike the other locations, the dogs here are fresh since I'm sure they have a higher turnover than the Venetian.  

So when you're in the mood for a good hotdog under $2, hit up NY NY.  Rule #1:  Always be sure to go to the location with the highest turnover to ensure a fresh dog."}
{"text":"I am reviewing their chicken wings and fries combo. 5 stars. The best god damn wings I have ever had, and to top it off, you also get a side of those greasy goodness fries. $10 for that combo, well worth it."}
{"text":"Mediocre food that is very bland. For the price and quality, the cost is way off. Footlong chili cheese dog and onion rings will run you $20."}
{"text":"My lovely gf had a buy 1 entrée, get 1 entrée free coupon for this place, so we decided to grab a quick bite here before heading home.
We each ordered the chili dog with fresh cut fries. The chili dog was pretty awesome in my book, although I wish the sausage (wiener har har) was bigger. The size of it was the kind you can buy at a grocery store that comes in like a 12 pack. But, unlike making it at the home, the hot dog was more awesome; the wiener was cooked to be slightly crunchy on the outside, but very juicy and flavorful on the inside. As for the chili, you can see the beans in it, but it's not overpowered by them, and the chili itself isn't overwhelming as I usually find it to be in a hot dog joint. 
As for the fresh cut fries, think movie theater or target fries. The cuts are fairly large and plump but there's a certain offsetting smell to them, the smell of cafeteria fries or so.
One regular coke was more than 3 bucks which made no sense to me. How can a hot dog joint charge almost half the price of an entrée for a drink? This is not cool.
3.5 stars

Cliff Notes: the chili dog is pretty legit"}
{"text":"Almost as good as I remember growing up in NY. The dogs were good and the fries were not as good as I remember. This is a food court location so maybe that's why but who knows. I would eat the dogs again."}
{"text":"Want a great alternative to the casual restaurants at Vegas?  Hop over to the food court at the Venetian and eat at Nathan's Famous.  They have an extensive menu ranging from hot dogs, chicken wings, salads, philly cheesesteaks, and more.  I recommend the chili dogs with sauteed onions and french french fries.  I recommend that you go to vegas4locals.com and print out a coupon for Nathan's that entitles you for a free hot dog when one is purchased.  You will easily save $4 that you can use for gambling. 

Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"My wife and I got off the MGM Grand Monorail and decided to eat at the casino. We didn't want to spend too much money, so we decided to check out the food court. For me reason, I felt like Nathan's after we have eaten at the Venetian location the night before. I ordered the 2 Nathan Hot Dogs and Fries for $9.99. If you know how expensive this place is, you'd understand that this is actually a great deal. For some odd reason, the hot dogs did not have that snap that I was used to. I was also quite disappointed with the quality of fries; they were soggy. The quality of the food is supposed to be consistent at all Nathan's chains. The MGM Grand's location has failed that tremendously. Oh well. We'll see what happens when Nathan's reopens at New York New York."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped hot dog. Yup. Why you so expensive though? $4 for a drink? I'd rather compile, collect, and store my saliva in my left cheek and swallow every 10 minutes."}
{"text":"The first time I had Nathan's was in New York on Coney Island. You can't eat one in Downtown Pittsburgh and get the same results. The boardwalk, the rides, the ocean, the sand, and the smells of Coney Island are all part of the experience.

What do I love about the natural casing dogs? The snap when you bite into it, the heavy garlic that Nathan's uses in their recipe, and what's better than a bigger than the bun weiner? Who needs the carbs? Slather on some dark mustard, some chopped onion and you got a meal fit for a ..... Coney Island Freak! On Coney Island these cost a little under three bucks, 2 for 5.25. Not bad for New York.

One draw back about being vegan, they don't make a vegan Nathan's dog!"}
{"text":"I gave it an extra star for being open and available in my drunken state. Youd think though in a drunken state the food wouldve been amazing. However, it was super dry and looked almost like left over food was used. The only thing i enjoyed was the fresh coconut...but even that, the way they give it you doesnt make it easy to drink it...meh. i mean...next time just eat some mcdonalds and your better off with some nuggets."}
{"text":"Went based on name recognition and I don't think I could be more disappointed. The menu board said you could get relish, onions, and/or kraut, but when the bored-looking girl asked if I wanted onions or relish and I said yes and sauerkraut, I got a snippy \"we don't have kraut.\" Not \"we're out,\" \"don't have.\" Mustard dispensers were empty and it was gross to see the alternating use of the coaster-buzzing-device by the ungloved lady dealing with customers and gloved kitchen staff."}
{"text":"It was one of the most dry, tasteless philly cheese steaks i've had the misfortune of eating. Wow... how hard is it to add some freaking salt and pepper on the meat. Not that it would have helped much. Oh the meat had a freezer burnt taste. Save your $14"}
{"text":"Completely average food for an expensive price. On a cool spring night, we decided to grab something quick before heading into the shark reef. The chili cheese fries didn't have much flavor, they weren't as good as I remembered and the hot dog was rather messy. I got it with onions, sauerkraut, relish, and mustard. The sauerkraut was too a bit sweet, it didn't really taste like sauerkraut. Overall, this place is overpriced and you can find much better food in Vegas for the same cost. The 3 stars is a little too generous, but it wasn't terrible, just basic."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Nathan's. We have had their plain hot dogs before, so we decided to go for a chili cheese dog and a bacon dog. Delish.

Both dogs were really good. I like the fact that they use the fake gooey cheese on their stuff. Its so bad for you, but it's sooo good. Especially when mixed with chili and/or bacon and a hot dog.

Expensive for a hot dog, but a great guilty pleasure meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great hotdogs. If you like chili cheese and jalapeños on your dog you have gotta try this place. If you're a fan of beer batter onion rings this again is the place for you. Prices are good for casino food and location always seems clean."}
{"text":"Went to Nathans to grab a midday snack and a break from the blackjack table.  Got the wing basket with fries.  Wings were super crispy, cooked well and the fries were good.  No sauce on the wings which is a huge plus for me.  And, I was able to sit in the sportsbook bar with a bucket of 5 beers for $20?  All was good in my world!"}
{"text":"I have never been to Coney Island and the closest I've gotten to Nathan's is in the Venetian in Vegas. My BF got a cheesesteak sandwich (fully loaded with everything) with those Ruffles-looking fries. He paid approx. $16. He was being really selfish and only let me get a couple of bites but WOW, that was one damn good sandwich.

Next time, I'm buying my own and will try one of their dogs since that's what Nathan's are known for."}
{"text":"First stop when we arrived was Nathan's at Luxor. 

I finally got my own cheese steak (fully loaded with mushrooms, onions and peppers) with a side of those thick crinkle fries. The cheese steak and fries combo was $9.95 and didn't include a drink but the thing was huuuuuuuuuuuuge. 

I ate every single bit of my sandwich and fries in like 5 minutes. I even beat my fiance and finished before he did. We didn't even talk to each other while we ate. I don't even think I even came up for air. 

We even got a buy one get one free coupon for our next visit. You bet we were there again the day we left Vegas."}
{"text":"So disappointing...  I was at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas over the weekend and made a trip to the food court.  It was right between breakfast/lunch switch.  I got in line for the breakfast waffle bar at Nathan's Hotdogs.  I was approached by what seemed to be a shift leader or manager in a white shirt.  She told me that she had to cut the breakfast line and that I could start a lunch line if I wanted lunch.  I totally understood, told her no worries and was first in the lunch line.  Several groups of people got behind me.  What happened next was very frustrating.  A young woman walked up and she didn't ask her to move.  I waited to make sure she was going to be served breakfast.  Once she was allowed to order a waffle I walked up to the manager and said that this was not right.  Myself along with 3 or 4 other people were refused breakfast but she let this woman order.  She then spoke to the other woman in Spanish, which I do not understand.  To add injury to insult they tried to tell me she phoned in an order.  Which was a lie; we all saw her order the waffle.  2 other people also started to complain that she too should have been turned away.  One gentleman asked to speak to her supervisor.  The supervisor just stood there like we were wasting his time.  After the gentleman explained this incident, the supervisor said Thank You, turned and walked in the back.   I have always been a Nathan's fan but myself and the customers that witnessed this behavior got out of line and  went to McDonald's next store and I vowed to never again purchase a Nathan's product if this is the way they value their customers."}
{"text":"Got a regular hot dog and chili cheese fries, it hit the spot. I wasn't expecting much from a hot dog stand, but they delivered. Chili cheese fries were the bomb."}
{"text":"Staying in Ballys on my trip to Vegas, I decided to try the little food court in the hotel. The food was so overpriced for what I got, taste wasn't really there. Service wasn't the best. Save your money!"}
{"text":"Holy fucking shit! Absolutely the worst example I have ever seen in 25+ years in the food service industry. I'm not even going to address the particulars but if you are a hot dog stand and can't make a fucking edible hot dog you should go home and hang yourself. We had an hour left of our 2 hour layover and had to run to board. Hamburger-crap. Chicken sandwich-downright dangerous looking. Second hot dog- directly in the trash. Insanely overpriced even for airport in Vegas. 10 fucking dollars for a 3oz pre-cooked microwave heated \"chicken breast\" with a couple tomato slices and a few leaves of brown wilted lettuce? No fucking thank you. Chicken was grainy and slippery, not a good sign in my not so humble opinion. No refunds? Good thing this is a captive audience with limited choices. If I had the luxury of returning the would be pain. Lots of pain. Such a fonging you would receive."}
{"text":"Not quite the Nathan's I grew up with in New York.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"so we decide to grab a bite before the NYE craziness...I get a bacon, cheese hotdog...it was like $6.95 just for the dog...OMG r u serious? Totally not worth it...and the bf got the philly cheese steak and fries combo..it was totally dry and NG (not good)...we liked the environment at the MGM food court but Nathan's was a total bust here..not worth the $20+ we spent here..."}
{"text":"One cashier during a lunch rush seems a little stupid considering it too me 10 min to get to order but the wait between ordering and being served wasn't too bad at all, so that's a plus.

I sprung for the foot long bacon and cheddar burger - the hotdog itself was ok. The cheddar \"cheese\" topping was more or less that nacho cheese paste which was fine. The strips of bacon were a nice touch but kinda chewy so they break right away and caused the dog to fall apart. Pulling the bacon out and eating it separately remedied this.

Fries? Pretty solid, probably the best part of the meal (besides the much needed, overpriced beer)."}
{"text":"Went to Nathans Famous at Ballys casino at 11:25am, but the lady says they're not ready until another 15 mins.  What the???  Who ever heard of a fast food joint not ready for customers around lunch time??
Terrible service right from the get go, so I didnt even eat there, so no review regarding the food.  : ("}
{"text":"Connected to Jersey Mike's it is the same third rate staff and dirty environment. If you can't keep clean areas in line of sight to the counter I don't want to even think about the storage and other back spaces. Expensive? It's  an airport and one in Vegas at that. The airport management need to do more to bring up food standards."}
{"text":"Its average, there is a lot more restaurants with better philly cheese steak, staff are ok, price is not cheep compared to what you eat. on other hand, it didn't take long to get my order ready."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for Philly sandwich and split for 2 of us. Real good sandwich and just right portion to split in half, which they did. Busy today but did not take long. I would return."}
{"text":"Short review, not much to write about. I had a hot dog. It was pretty good. It was also Vegas priced. That's about it."}
{"text":"Located along the walkway to the monorail at Bally's. They have a nice breakfast special that is a bunch of food for $8.95 (eggs, pancakes, potatos, meat), so if your hungry then this is the place for you. Of course they also have hot dogs too but I ate none of that.

I stopped here to get my salads to go. I loved that they were always made fresh for me. I was also able to get my croutons on the side. I hate soggy croutons on a salad. It was also only $3 bucks to add grilled chicken, which is not a bad deal. They even put that on the side per my request. I don't like wilting lettuce from hot items. I am really high maientence when it comes to my salads luckily there dressing came in tiny containers or we would have had another request.

Quality of items were good and I was happy and my heart was happy with the healthy options. There can sometimes be a line here especially around lunch time or early for breakfast. They give out pagers so you can grab a table or just get out of the way and wait until your food is ready. The Bally's Sports book is over here, so you can watch a little sports while your food is being prepared but don't try to eat it there or you will get yelled at. It hasn't happened to me but I've seen others get yelled at."}

{"text":"Vegas-priced just like all of the other fast food chains on the strip, but I overlook that and just focus on the quality of the hot dog.

Good hot dogs here. I have had the regular hot dog topped with sauerkraut and a cheese hot dog and both get my recommendation. I haven't had the fries so I can comment on that.

A hot dog meal with chips and drink cost about $8.00. Not the healthiest food but I would consider it if I was in the mood for hot dogs."}
{"text":"Marvelous service & friendly cook. Quick & to the point food. Philly cheesesteak tastes how you expect it to taste. Its hot, cheese melty, firm mushrooms with soft meat & toasty bread."}
{"text":"Vegas Pizza Crawl 2016: Being from NY I normally would never bother with \"NY style\" pizza in Vegas but after giving up on a multi-hour line at Oyster Bar in Palace Station we wanted something relatively fast and cheap, and that devolved into deciding to try ALL the pizza at NY, NY.

Was skeptical about a Nathan's that served pizza as well but it was shockingly not terrible! I've had MUCH worse pizza in Vegas, namely Grimaldi's in the Palazzo, which I had (mistakenly) thought would be fairly safe as it's an institution (though not my favorite) in Brooklyn where people line up around the block in below freezing temps for a pie. In fact, I've (on rare occasion) even experienced worse pizza in the real NY, NY. In fact, even the crust was edible and better than my favorite pizza shops in LA (Mulberry St Pizza - the one in the valley, not the Beverly Hills one - and Abbott's).

I was also missing Nathan's crinkle fries so gave that a whirl too. It's weird that here you can only get no-cheese, chili cheese, or bacon cheese fries instead of just cheese fries. Got the bacon on the side so I could test the authenticity of the cheese fries first, and was pleasantly surprised to find that they're pretty much the same. Good QC on your outposts, there, Nathan's. Was also happy to discover that the cheese fries were just as good with bacon. They gave us 2 condiment cups full of fatty bacon swimming in its own grease, more than enough to cover a serving, and I happily fished the rest of the bacon out of the cups of liquid fat using the weird but signature Nathan's \"fry trident\" (\"fry-dent\"?) and polished them off by themselves. I hope Nathan's has added this to their menus in NY/NJ because this was a winner, but I do hope they haven't done away with the traditional ovo-lacto option.

Everything was of course twice as expensive as it would be in NY (it's an expensive city but cheap eats abound).

Now I'm sad I didn't get a hot dog to fully relive my childhood."}
{"text":"My usually food choice inside MGM. I usually order the Philly Cheesesteak with fries, which are ginormous. I've also tried their cripsy chicken sandwhich which is pretty good as well.

This place would be four stars but (much like every other restaurant in Vegas) the food is overpriced."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken Philly and large fries. Only took them 9minutes to cook (mind you this is in a good court setting). Fries were good and hot. Sandwich was beyond tiny, especially for its $13 price tag."}
{"text":"they are hot dogs. its not like NY. they are good hot dogs, i admit, but with all the great food in Vegas, why eat something like this?

because your boyfriend thinks it is awesome to make his girlfriend get dressed up, put on shoes that are really not for walking the strip and then take her to a hot dog joint at a food court, because you could \"really do a chili dog to get pumped for the night!\"

needless to say, we are no longer together.

ok, crankiness aside. I really like Nathans. when I have jeans and a t-shirt on and don't care that a drop of mustard goes down my shirt. that's when this place is appropriate. I hope that men everywhere learn from this tragedy."}

The last pics were bad since they keep it real dark in the place so I posted a new one."}
{"text":"Came to grab a quick breakfast before starting on the arduous drive from LV to LA. 

It's assembly-line cafeteria style. Most people ordered some combo of eggs, cheese, bacon/sausage on either an English muffin or a biscuit. We were actually pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as bad as school-lunch-cafeteria quality breakfast. I would say it's a level above McDonald's quality.

I ended up getting egg, cheese, and sausage on an English biscuit - pretty satisfying and tasty. The egg had an artificial look to it, made into a suspiciously perfect square shape, but it actually tasted alright! The cheese was cheddar and melted onto the egg-square. The sausage was a little on the salty side, as was the biscuit. I ended up not finishing my breakfast sandwich because it got too salty after a while, but it definitely filled me up! 

They also have waffles and breakfast plates here - but most people seemed to avoid these for some reason! 

Overall, in a food court with limited breakfast options, Nathan's isn't a bad choice."}
{"text":"Rude and horrible service. Ordered breakfast there and they overcharged me from what it said on the menu. When I inquired about it the employee was very rude and said it's in the computer as that price and basically was hoping I'd go away. She told the other girl what happened who was also rude to me. They were nasty to the woman waiting behind me also. then asked to speak to the manager because I'm tired of places listing a price then overcharging (notice it's never undercharging). The manager came up and handed me the difference and said \"it's only a few dollars\" as if I was wrong to say something. I never went back to Nathan's the entire trip. Overpriced for fast food and employees that look miserable and try to cheat you out of money"}
{"text":"I think in my opinion it is a bit waste of money. I ordered chicken wings, a large fries and a hotdog. when my order came out, it was not what I expected. the hotdog was so small I can consume it in 30 seconds. and the chicken wings are hard and chewy. Albertsons has way better chicken wings at a cheaper prices. not to mention the price was a bit expensive for what they offer. 

if i were you, ill save my money, make a drive to the grocery store and buy and cook ur own hotdogs."}
{"text":"The fries are the best even though they are soggy.  My husband loved the beef hotdogs.  We also enjoyed the lemonade and orangeade. The customer service was exceptional and the meal was ready within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Good taste... always trustworthy on cleanliness... but DANG! Why you gotta be the stingiest place I've been to with the meats. Philly places usually STACK their sandwiches with the contents inside. I could physically close my sandwich into a complete fold without you seeing any of the contents inside. That's a problem. 

I like you. I do. So stop trying to be so unlikable. Have you ever had that ex that you enjoyed but they were just TRYING to get broken up with? That's what this feels like. Make the people happy. Put a little bit of food inside of that bread. It's not going to break the bank THAT much giving maybe even a single ounce more of meat for example. But that's just me and my opinion for a guy paying $13 for a fast food Philly. Just saying."}
{"text":"4 star review is for the bacon double cheeseburger. Prices get a solid 2 stars, I literally yelled at my son for paying $15 for a burger from.a 2.5 star joint, but according to him it was delicious and he's quite the picky little turd lol.. Smelled and looked delicious, so if you can stomach the price, burger gets two thumbs up from Bubba :)"}
{"text":"The price brings the overall stars down from 4 to 3.  And also to all the other reviewers, is it really necessary to curse to get across how much you love or hate wieners.  I love wieners as much as the next guy/gal.  Especially Nathan's wieners with natural casing that has a certain crispness when biting into it.  
Also their lemon drink is quite tasty and compliments the fries and wieners.  

Only thing is they are hot when you get them. You may have to let them cool down or just blow on them to coolem down faster."}
{"text":"We had a coupon for a buy one, get one free hot dog.
So, my boyfriend got two chili dogs with everything on it. One chili dog is $11.45 plus tax. He's never had Nathan's hot dogs before, and he quite enjoyed them. He had been talking about hot dogs all vacation.
Of course, they aren't as good as Pink's hot dogs (on La Brea in Los Angeles, CA). If you haven't had those, it's totally worth the long wait in line."}
{"text":"THANK GOD it opens late!!!!!! We were starving at 2AM and we didn't feel like walking out to the strip to find something to eat and Nathan and MCD at Luxor's fod court were the only two that were open inside the hotel (well the pyramid cafe was open too, but we felt like real junk food!!!)

The price is steep for a fast food!!! 8-9 dollars for a hot dog??!!(the ones with toppings) that's wild!!

We opted for the deal 2 hot dogs and 1 fries deal for 9.99....the cheapest on the menu... (hey.. we lost our $$$ while gambling earlier that day!!!)

The dog literally popped in my mouth as I bite into the hot dog... yummmmmmmmmmmmm..... loving it!!!!

Definitely a great late night snack.... :)"}

{"text":"Crappy flavorless chili cheese dog for an obnoxious amount of money! 13 dollars for a hotdog!!! Even if it's the size of a hot dog and a half that still doesn't work out in my book. The fries were bland and only temperate. I am not surprised that they didn't have a line when McDonald's and their fast service had one! That was another thing it took 15 minutes to cook 3 dogs?"}
{"text":"tried to order a large combo with a hot dog and orangeade. The guy says an orangeade can't be part of a combo. WTF!? a reg soda =$3.29 a reg orangeade =$3.29 a large soda =$3.49 a large orangeade =$3.49. Am I missing something here? I'm not a smart man but I don't understand why an orangeade can't be part of the combo."}
{"text":"The Nathan's I went to was the one in the arcade at New York New York (right when you get up the escalator).  Their pizza and garlic bread looked and smelled like I would need to slap somebody in the face with a bag o nickels after one bite.. but i was there to have a burger so i went with that instead.  I thought it was kind of retarded how the burgers automatically come with fries but no drink... like you cant get the burger by itself but you have to order a drink seperately? Ree... tar... ted.  I had my burger with chilli cheese fries which weren't that great, especially since it had beans in it, and the cheese was just lame nacho cheese sauce.  The burger itself was okay.. I wish I had ordered the pizza and garlic bread instead."}
{"text":"When you are hungry at an airport - I find myself looking at the lines. Instead of going to the popular perhaps best place - I find myself going to the place with the shortest line and most of the time it isn't because they are the quickest servers.

However, this place was actually different. It had a short line - it was quick on service and the food was exceptionally good for what it was. I wouldn't want to live off the food, but those fries - how do they do that - they were GREAT!

The value wasn't there though - and that's the problem with some of these food places at the airport. It isn't a 5 star restaurant, but they charge as if they were and that's a big turn off. However, if you are hungry and want something good and fast - check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"Expensive overall! Ask for cup for ice water it's free. 
Hot dog is $6. The hot dog was good. Nathan's is always good! Extra for chili & cheese. Also serve pizza."}
{"text":"Just like I remember it with the skinny hot dogs with snappy skins, unlike the larger Nathan hot dogs at Sam's Club food court. Available plain or with chili. 
Free topping bar has sauerkraut and sauteed onions. Starting around $3 for a hot dog so not exactly cheap eats.

This location also has a Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips though I didn't try it."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Nathans! even though the dog wasn't big enough, the flavors were just all bunched inside which separates these hot dogs from a lot. The cheese bacon fries were soo good!! The portions were pretty damn big which made my day. The prices for the dogs are pretty expensive though which is a loss.

I'd come back for more!!"}
{"text":"$13 for two REGULAR HOT DOGS that don't have the size and quality of Nathan's Famous in Coney Island, NY where I am from.  They didn't even have sauerkraut and expected payment before seeing their poor representation of their \"Nathan's Famous Coney Island Hot Dog\"

WHAT A MAJOR MISLEADING RIPOFF

They should be called, \"Nathan's Unimpressive!\""}
{"text":"Over hyped and over priced! $5.95+tax=$6.43 for a little teeny weeny chili dog?! Come on its just a hotdog! No wonder those hotdog eating contestants can eat so much of these!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Chicken Philly.  It was so bad, I tossed it into the trash after 3 bites.  Chili cheese fries tasted like cheap bad food.  Lemonade was good.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Until this day, I wonder why I even stopped by here granted that I live roughly 45 minutes away from Coney Island. Nathan's is good for late-night munchies before or after hitting the game floor, but nothing else.

The wait is a pain. Imagine waiting 35 minutes for a cheese dog and fries. That's literally all I ordered, and I waited that long even though there were only two people ahead of me. It was even more annoying when the drunk guys behind me received their food first. The hot dog? It was just \"okay,\" salty like any other hot dog--nothing more. To add to the long wait and ordinary hot dog, the cheesy crinkle fries were soft and cold even after the cashier/cook fried a whole batch. You're better off paying more for a better hot dog elsewhere."}
{"text":"Being a former New Yorker, I occasionally dine in the NY-NY Nathans when I am on the South Strip. My taste buds hold Nathan's fries and super cheeseburger in high esteem. However my wallet doesn't. They charge double the price here  (no surprise).
    I enjoy the Coney Island theme and dining environment. The oldies playing here put me in a relaxed mood. In all respects this dining environment reminds me of Johnny Rockets.
   If this were a regular brick and martar Nathans I'd have to have an insatiable craving for it to spend $15 for a medium coke, fries, and super cheeseburger. I will pay extra to dine in a nicely themed fast food restaurant serving food that is 
popular where I grew up."}
{"text":"Before posting this review on Yelp, I give a shout out to Christie. L. When I posted this review originally back in the summer, the Powers to Be took down this business listing and merged the Review in to the Alienate business listing. Christie. L fought for this business listing. Thanks to her persistence people are able to share their experiences on the first locals Nathan's. Without further delay, here is my experience from the summer. 


Original Review when It opened in the Summer:

  \"Nathan's is to New York what Pink's Hot Dogs is to Las Angeles. When Nathan's opens up a new eatery it is a big deal to New York transplants.

  This is the first Nathan's Famous in Las Vegas to open outside the Resort corridor. It is located in Aliente Hotel and Casino. 

  The Grand Opening of the first local's Nathan's never made Vegas Eater or the news. I'd find out about the new Nathan's from my brother. And so, today after hiking up in the Las Vegas Ski and Snow Resort, I made Nathan's my post hike dinner.

  Nathan's serves one of the best fast food burgers that I have ever eaten. In my opinion, they are even better than their World famous hot dogs. The only thing is that the New York -New York Nathan's appears to be the only Las Vegas location that serves them. In my opinion, Nathan's also serves one of the best fries. Their crinkly cut fries are out of this World delicious. I'd enjoy their crinkly cut fries with a chicken club sandwich meal.

   Unlike the resort corridor Nathan's, a standard meal isn't going to cost you the equivalent of a casual dining chain. Here, the chicken club meal that included a Large crinkly cut fries and Large Pepsi was less than  $10. On the Strip, it would be around $15.

  Nathan's weakness is that many of their locations are poorly managed. Recently I gave the Bally's location one star. On my visit, the employees were on top of their game. I was greeted right away and the wait was minimal.   

   In closing, I hope that this location does well and that it is the start of more Las Vegas openings. And I hope that it doesn't fall into the hands of bad management.\""}
{"text":"After a 1 year hiatus, this Nathan's is off my Wall of Shame List. When my family and I ate here last Spring, it was a lousy experience. My previous review captures customer service at its most where kids are running the place without supervision. The kids overcharged my dad and made it look like it was his fault. Consequently, I wrote a well-deserved 1 star review. 

  Nathan's serves a product that I admire. It is their crinkly cut fries. In my opinion, Nathan's crinkly cut fries are the best. Fast forward to last week's family vacation based out of Paris Hotel & Casino, we would give the Bally's food court Nathan's another try. It was around 10 pm at night and we were hungry and in the mood for Nathan's. 

  Two hard working women ran the food court restaurant. Disparate from the 2015 visit, they were friendly and worked in a fast and efficient manner. And disparate from the kids serving us last year they knew how to add. We ordered at the counter, one of the women presented us with a buzzer, a few minutes later it went off and it was time to dig in. 

  I ordered a Nathan's hot dog with crinkly cut fries and a Large soda. The Nathan's hot dog lived up to the Nathan's name. The crinkly cut fries one more time set my taste buds on fire. It was the crinkly cut fries and not the hot dog that led us back here later in the vacation for a snack. 

  Although they do not serve those delicious beef super cheeseburgers, I have a beef about the high prices. In similar style to several restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip their prices are inflated. A hot dog, large soda, and crinkly cut fries came out to approximately $15. That is close to having a full service meal in the Palazzo Grimaldi's or the Forum Shops Cheesecake Factory.

 I am glad to report that Nathan's got evicted from my Wall of Shame. Their crinkly cut fries are an outstanding product that led us back to The Bally's Nathan's after a one year hiatus. The Bally's Nathan's may be outrageously priced, however, you live once so why not enjoy the delectable taste of two New York City imports: The Nathan's hot dog and crinkly cut fries."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places at the food court at the MGM Grand.  This is fast food:  Nothing fancy and the people behind the counter don't give a shit about you so you have to speak up when you order.  That's really the bottom line.  I had the sausage, egg and cheese muffin two mornings in a row along with a hashbrown.  Other than trying to hustle drinks on you, I'd say this is a really good place to eat.  Your other choices are McDonald's (for the price conscience), or the pizza place.  I forgot the other place to the left of Nathan's.  This is a great place for breakfast.  However, looking at all the other reviews, you probably want to pass for all the other meals."}
{"text":"So again on a quest for a decent yet budget friendly meal we found this locations in the top corner of New York New York.  They had a selection I was not ready for as you see Nathan's and you think... Hot Dogs.  Well yes they had hot dogs, but they also had Pizza, Stromboli, and even Cheese Steaks.  So being the east coast girl I am, I could not pass up what looked to be a decent cheese steak.  

Everyone's version is a little different when it comes to cheese steaks.  I decided to go with the Bacon Cheese steak.   I was a little disappointed that the bacon was more boiled then crisp.  The rolls they use also didn't really hold up to well to the product.  As anyone one knows, a cheese steak is 50% about the bread.  

Their fries are thick crinkle cut, which were actually pretty good.  A little crisper would have been my preference.  

Over all it was a decent and yet again sharable meal if you wanted it to be.  Or something to satisfy a larger appetite all to yourself."}
{"text":"Fries were over cooked and burned and the Krispy Chicken sandwich was $10 and it was the size of a McDonalds small Hamburger, LOL definitely not the business and as far as the flavor it was OK nothing special though, I would never eat here again to be honest. Oh Yeah LMAO the medium soda was $4."}
{"text":"Not good!! Ordered the Krispy Chicken Salad. The picture showed tomatoes and cheese, crispy chicken chunks, croutons and choice of dressing. I got romaine lettuce with dressing and croutons and a weird mound of chicken on top. The chicken (while fried) was not crispy but instead kind of rubbery and chewy in an odd way. I checked and it wasn't fat and it WAS cooked all the way through so I'm not sure why it was so nasty. If imitation chicken exists, that was it. It was disgusting so I thought I would eat the little garlic knot that came on the same, looked good. But alas, it was cold and hard, like it had been stored in a fridge instead of under a warming lamp. I don't leave negative reviews often or rip into people unless they really deserve it. I guess that's what I get for trying to order a salad at a place that specializes in hotdogs. Thanks Nathan's, lesson learned."}
{"text":"Gotta love a hot dog before a movie! Never a line and the food is fresh and tasty. Lots of seating at the food court."}
{"text":"I love jackie. She has the best customer service ever! My food always comes out perfect when she works. Nathan's got lucky finding such a beautiful soul like hers"}
{"text":"Did not have much dinner the previous night and was hungry as hell, woke up at 9am friend was still zzzz .. so breakfast was going to be alone .. stay at Tuscany meant one thing that either the walk to strip was going to be a long one or log on to their cafe and eat. Then decided to do the former and wandered off.

Just 500 meters towards strip, I remember Bally's food court opening. Decided to peep in .. saw a Subway, a Sbarro and a few others. Yeah !! this was going to be my breakfast place today .. decided without wasting a sec.

Now came the tough question, Subway or Pizza .. then my eye got a glimpse of the breakfast menu .. scrambled eggs toast butter farmers potato + adding fresh brew for $2 .. and that was the best breakfast I could have asked for .. piping hot eggs .. bread toasted to perfection .. even the retail jelly felt awesome at that point of time :D ..

Farmer's Potato with charred onions were great ..

Overall, loved every bit of it and returned the other day as well .. I know should have gone somewhere else and I understand that there was nothing special in that breakfast, I mean eggs and potato there ain't anything special in there .. but given my situation I loved it to the core and did not even think once going anywhere else.. 

A contended man here and Yay !! I am a fan :)"}
{"text":"MMMMMmmmmm.... It's nice to know along with the 5 star prix fixe menus, I can still find a great hot dog in Vegas. It's from NATHAN's... just its reputation stands up. Ironically, they also serve Pink's in LV, but with that inflated price, I'd rather pick up Nathans! What trip to Sin City isn't without gluttony?"}
{"text":"This Nathan's is in the Luxor Hotel's food court.  I'd heard of Nathan's, but had never been to one until Sunday night.  I know they're famous for their hot dogs, but decided to get the chicken club with fries.  T. got the same and the kids got-surprise-chicken strips.  The sandwiches were big and tasty.  The kids got 5 good sized strips.  They liked them very much.  The fries, oh my goodness!  They were so good!  They're thick and crinkled.  The people working there were very nice and effiecient.  A great choice when you've had enough of the Vegas buffets."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but I wish the portions were bigger.  My humans thought there was plenty, but I never have enough food.  I am a 15lb dog who appreciates good food and good beer.  I don't believe in diets, and I dislike cats!"}
{"text":"So this Nathan's is in the foodcourt at the MGM, which shares the space with a Panda Express-like Chinese food place, a McDonald's, and a Pizza place.  It's actually an interesting place for a foodcourt, considering Craftsteak and SeaBlue (by Michael Mina) are practically right next door.

I got the 2 hot dog and fries combo for $8.95.  The staff seemed friendly enough.  I didn't have any problems.

The hot dogs are just.  I guess you can say it's like how people go gaga over Pink's for no good reason because let's face it, Pink's isn't even really that good.  You go really only for the experience of eating at a Los Angeles institution.  I feel the same way with Nathan's.  It's such a historic New York tradition that when someone says \"I want to go try Nathan's\" not because it's THAT good, but because it's a cultural experience.  That's my two cents anyway.

I would however have to say that the hotdog skin has nice pop.  You know what I mean?  No?  Amateurs....

I probably wouldn't come back though."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but the meat is worth it. Although Nathan's is famous for its hot dogs, try the cheesesteaks! Twice the meat and twice the satisfaction but as always, a bit expensive."}
{"text":"I have had poorly put together food before, undoubtedly.  I ordered the original crispy sandwich,  with a sweet tea.  I opened my \"sandwich\" to find the smallest slab of fried chicken,  with soggy lettuce,  and a seemingly rotting tomato.  It didn't end there,  biting into it the chicken had a rubbery unchewable texture. The sauce tasted that of old change, like a penny. 

Now the fries,  dear god how do you screw up fries? ! 
1\" in length, but still bent in half due to them being so soggy and overcooked.  

In a nut shell,  I paid 12$ for unsweetened tea and a bag full of the worst fast food in my life."}
{"text":"For some reason, whenever I have good hot dogs that are worth every stinking dollar I paid, I always want to smoke two (2) cigarettes, one after another, while faux-drunk calling an ex-girlfriend.

Food court did not have ashtrays nearby. 
Cellphone signal was blocked in the casino.

Serendipity likes to tie me up and have her way with me sometimes."}
{"text":"Great fries. They are thick and soft on the inside. Chili is good. Not much else to them."}
{"text":"I love Nathan's and this location didn't disappoint!  Staff was friendly and it was quick so I could catch my flight.  Just like all airport vendors, it's a bit overpriced but nothing you can do about that."}
{"text":"Waited over 20 minutes after ordering. Had to pester the girl at the pickup counter several times before she looked at my ticket and gave me a stale sandwich that had been sitting out for 10 minutes. No apology for screwing up the order. I was so hungry that I ate most of the sandwich before realizing it wasn't the sandwich I ordered and had mushrooms on it. I recommend avoiding this place if you have food allergies or have less than 45 min to order and eat."}
{"text":"So if you want to actually find this place dont ask someone who works at bally's the first guy sent me to the opposite end of the property,what a knucklehead and sadly a testimony to the pathetic state of pride that workers once took in their surroundings,sad. Anyways,I finally made my way down to the joint. I ordered the chili cheese dog combo,for 20 bucks..lol only in vegas. What they served me looked like a hot dog for king kong,so i can see why it was more expensive. what i really wanted was a normal sized good old fashioned dog,not some massive steroid dog. The dog was not hot all the way through,big pet peeve of mine I would like to avoid food poisoning by having my food served cooked and hot,I know im so demanding haha. The cheese was like that cheese whiz they serve at 7-11..but worse lol. The chili was meh. The fries were actually pretty good i like the thicker cut steak fry type so these were not bad. Its funny I used to come down here when I was a kid,this whole area is really changed. Anyways i'm not going to go out of my way to return but if i happen to be in the hotel I might wander down for a standard dog."}
{"text":"The food was alright, once we got it, but the service was awful. We made it pretty clear what we wanted, reading it right off the menu and then clearly stating what we did and didn't want on our dogs. Not only did get get the dogs wrong, they got the quantity wrong and forgot the drinks. Then after making so many mistakes, they also believed we shorted them about $1, which we gave them just to get them to leave us alone, even though I'm pretty sure the girl at the till just didn't know how to count. It was a pretty miserable experience."}
{"text":"We came here to grab a quick breakfast. They offer waffles, pancakes, cheese omelettes, bacon, sausage, and hash browns for breakfast. I decided to get pancakes and a hash brown and the bf got a cheese omelette with sausage and a hash brown. I was pleasantly surprised to find that their pancakes were made-to-order. So I got fresh pancakes. The rest of the food was already pre-made and didn't look as good. The pancakes were light and fluffy, pretty good for a fast food joint. The hash brown, on the other hand, was cold and disgusting. It wasn't crunchy at all. If you want to eat a hash brown for breakfast, I suggest you go to the McDonald's next door to get a freshly made one. 

The bf also came back the next day to grab some lunch. He ordered the chili cheese hotdog with fries. He said that all he tasted was chili. He couldn't taste the hotdog at all. The hotdog was also on the small side. Maybe the regular hotdogs are a better bet."}
{"text":"First time for me at an official Nathan's hot dog stand. It was a pretty good hot dog and was nicely priced. 

I didn't really see how it was above any other hot dog stand but I will say that I enjoyed what I got. 

Just went with the straight up hot dog and mustard combo and I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Yeah nothing really special here. Grabbed a hotdog cuz I was starving and wasn't quite ready for dinner yet but was for sure ready for beer lol. 

Just another hotdog imo, nothing really stood out as special or delicious. 

I was hoping for more but just didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Tasty? Yes. Over-priced? WOW- by a ton!!! Two of us ate hot dogs and salads for $40! Way too much."}
{"text":"Staying at NY NY, I thought it fitting to try out Nathan's. My familiarity with the hot dogs from here was limited to the press on their annual hot dog eating competition.

Although their hot dogs are what they are known for, they also offer burgers, cheesesteaks and sandwiches. I had the chili cheese hot dog and crinkle-cut French fries combo ($7.99).

The hot dog was pretty good. The chili was a nice addition, though the cheese was a little too liquid like for my taste. The bun seemed pretty ordinary. The fries were nice.

I liked the hot dog and fries though the pricing is a bit inflated due to the location. A lot of better options on the Strip than Nathan's. But if you are just looking for a NY hot dog, Nathan's would be the place to go."}
{"text":"I ate here for breakfast almost every morning during my stay at the Luxor. It was the best option by far. I stuck with egg cheese and bacon or sausage biscuits. They were great after a late night.

That being said it was mostly just mediocre fast food breakfast. There were flies buzzing around the line and the eggs and cheese and permeated and just sitting in a tray waiting to be spatulaed onto a biscuit.

So it wasn't great but it's cheap for Vegas and it will do for. a quick meal."}
{"text":"The Philly cheese steak is good, meat is moist and tasty, bread is warm and soft, and they cut it into half for you ....pricey for a food court, for $14.00, yes, but hey, this is inside a casino in Vegas..so it is expected."}
{"text":"I've had Nathan's dogs at Coney Island and that was yonks ago. I don't think I'll be going back out there anytime soon so in the meantime, these dogs will have to do.

We've come back here several times to get snacks whether it be an early or a late snack there is always a line at this location. I guess if you're staying in the hotel then it just makes sense to go to this place.

I agree that the buns aren't so great and if the dogs were thicker it would be even better. However, nothing comes close to the snap of the Nathan's hot dogs and even though most of the time I try to resist these dogs so I can eat somewhere else, I end up having a bite or two of the dog. Their fries are seriously addictive, but I must say, it's damn expensive for what you get.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I thought i would grab a quick meal at lunch before i hit the Casino again. I order the Chili Cheese Dog with frieds and a soda. Again it's Vegas, $12.50  please! oh well,  just keep quite and go eat your lunch. If you want better, I guess you can try the $38 Buffet...."}
{"text":"Look, I love Nathans, but this one is no bueno. The service isn't nearly as good as the one in the Luxor, nor is the selection (no sandwhiches at all). If it weren't for the fries in this mother, I'd probably give it 2 stars, and only because it serves hot food.

Net: If you want Nathans, go to the Luxor. If you have to eat at the Fashion Show Mall, I suggest making the walk to Chipotle by Nordstrom, or the Nordstrom Cafe itself."}
{"text":"Is it wrong that this was my favorite part of Las Vegas?  In a city where everything seems ridiculously overpriced I found this little piece of heaven at the Monte Carlo.  The chicken is battered and fried as you wait, the fries are homecut  and also made to order.  It takes about 8 minutes to get your order so they give you a little buzzer which goes off when the food is ready.  Everything was crispy and fresh and oh so delicious...the best part was since I was staying in the hotel I could just run up to my room and scarf it all down in the comfort and privacy of my suite.  You have to try it...just do it!!"}
{"text":"SLOWWWWW service! 30 mins to have 3 small things done! 15 mins to get a cup of water re-filled! Ridiculous!!!!! Never coming back again!!"}
{"text":"my hubby and sister loved their hot dogs!  but we almost gagged on their fries...worst fries we've ever tried...completely not edible.  yuck.  anyway, no one in my party knew what/who Nathan's was but me! (and I'm a vegetarian!).  located inside the Venetian's maze of a casino at their food court."}
{"text":"Did I really pay $10 for a basic hot dog????  Oh yes I did.  My hubby said Costco's dogs were better.  Now THAT is saying a lot.  Located in Luxor's food court, this place has OVERPRICED written all over it."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Well priced, excellently located, and GREAT food.  I was so pleasantly surprised that I actually ate here 3 times in 2 days.  I would recommend the loaded fries and the hot dogs of course were great.  If you want quick, quality food at a reasonable price...this is your place."}
{"text":"The service was awful, they weren't that busy it is simple food designed to move
Quickly get it didn't."}
{"text":"Place is good at this location but damn pricey for one!!! Still a good deal compared to the restaurants at da Bay! LOL"}
{"text":"Went out this evening with the family for some old fashioned hot dogs. This was my first time ever at Nathan's and I have to say I was quite disappointed.  First was the price point which I thought was outrageous for the #2 I think the combo was was approaching $9 and on top of that another $1 up charge for a lemonade that I have to say was nothing special. The fries were overdone on the outside but soggy in the middle, don't have anything really bad to say about the hot dog other than a ball park all beef is bigger. Don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Food was below average, service is slower than steam off cold dog poop. For a chicken Caesar Club salad and bacon and cheese fries it took over 21 minutes from the time I paid. Then they screwed up the order and we got just a basic chicken caesar and they didn't give us a fork with it. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"Don't do it... one drop of a cheese does not a cheese-fries make!
Ordered a donut w/ my meal... and then didn't receive it.
Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"My lunch today .   French fries  were yummy.  The steak sandwich was ok. Orange drink was watered down"}
{"text":"It was barely ok. Staff were nice. Food had very little flavor. I never add salt to my food, today I had to. The ranch dressing was good. I gave it 3 stars because it's clean"}
{"text":"Nathan's $7 Cheeseburger Has Really Got Nothing Much More On A $1 McDouble

SITREP

It certainly has nothing On TWO $1 McDoubles.  And what would anyone rather pay for very similar fast food hamburger- metrics?  $7?  Or $2?

AIRPORT \"COST\" METRICS

\"Since we're an airport location, everything has to be more expensive!  *BULLSHIT*.  Nothing justifies more cost.  But GREED always comes into play with \"captured audiences\", also like concert or festival sites, malls, etc.  It's all *Bullshit*.

SERVICE

And what I can't abide is attitude given by the cook when I remind him he said the burger \"would be out in 5 mins\", more than 15 mins ago.  And then he said (again) it would be out in \"5 mins\".

*Shrug* Sometimes you don't win.

And sometimes therr are just times you feel like an explanation of logic & common measurements of time, would have more impact if shared with a brick wall.

THE LOWDOWN

2-Stars at least for the burger, cause it didn't suck.  But cost, time & attitude *supernova* the remaining stars."}

{"text":"My friend and I had finished seeing a show. Naturally, I get hungry after working up an appetite doing anything in Vegas. I decided to grab something at the food court at Luxor, and then taking it back to our hotel room to eat.

I saw Nathan's Famous and wanted a hot dog. I ordered one. I got my usual condiments, ketchup and relish, on it. My friend was patient to accompany me to the food court before we walked back to our room.

I was pleased that Luxor has its own food court. My hot dog was yummy and hit the spot. I don't recall how much it cost, but you do end up shelling out more money when you are at a hotel on the Strip. I don't have Nathan's often, so it was a decent, convenient trip to grab a quick bite.

The chili dog looked good. I didn't want anything too heavy before hitting the sack. Next time I am there, I'll give it a go.

I cannot even begin to explain how much I despise places that serve plastic-like wieners. It's disgusting. 

Nothing about our meal here was satisfying. The fries were overcookied and super greasy, I heard the wiener rip as I bit into it (YUCK), and the lemonade was watery.

I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Adela was very nice and took my order. All staff was super nice. I ordered my food to go and they told me \"here's your food and utensils are in the bag. Napkins are on the left, don't forget to take some.\" I don't know if people are unlucky with the staff but I had no issues and the chili dog and fries I ordered were great. I'd come back. Thank you kind staff."}
{"text":"I got the Philly Cheese steak.  It was pretty greasy.  It was alright.  Definitely not good hangover food."}
{"text":"Nathan's famous my ###!

The chili dog tasted like you can make one from scratching using canned food and microwaveables.  Same goes for the fries.  The fries sucked.  Cheap friends they were...

If you and friends want to order from this place, split the orders and wait for your order to be paid for and done with, one at a time.  There are coupons on the tray that you can apply to each order after the first order.  Save some while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We wanted something \"light\" for dinner.  With 5 fast food restaurants in the food court there wasn't a large selection to have a lighter meal.  So we had salads at Nathan's.  Given that Nathan's is a hot dog joint, the salads were surprisingly good and hit the spot.

The process is to order then they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready.  I guess it comes in handy if it gets really crowded but it wasn't so that seemed like a waste of time.

The bacon cheese fries were also good (OK, so I didn't entirely go light) but the bacon was overly smokey tasting.  Next time it will be cheese only.

Overall not a bad choice given the selection of restaurants in the food court."}
{"text":"The chili cheese hot dogs and lemonade were both really good, and the service was friendly and fast. However, the prices could be better."}
{"text":"It was the first dinner of my LoveBoat reunion in Vegas. We decided to grab something quick to eat before getting ready to go out. One of my friends is from New Jersey, and she pointed out Nathan's. Everyone else being from Cali was like.. what is that? and she said, WHAT?! YOU DONT KNOW WHAT NATHANS IS?!

We proceeded to order a large chili cheese with bacon (so fatty, so good). All of us ordered a hot dog (their \"famous\" one), and added grilled onions to it. Pretty good, but definitely pricey which was expected since we were in Vegas.

I'm not sure if I would ever go back to Nathan's when I'm in Vegas. It's good, but not really worth the trip into underground Bally's."}
{"text":"Mmmmm hot diggity dog its friday! Wait it's sunday. Any day is a good day for a dog. Obviously it's gonna be expensive in an airport but mmmmm food was good!   Even got a free drink , I forgot why but I know I got one!"}

{"text":"It's Nathans - so the food is great.  The reviews complaining about vegas price = lol - if you want Nathans on the cheap run by a grocery store and warm it up in your hotel room.  

Aside from all that - the 3-star is for one reason only, the staff here at this one has to be some of the unhappiest people in all of the strip area.  I'm sure it sucks serving drunken idiots all day long, but you signed up for it.  And it wasn't just one cashier or one person on the cooking line - everyone back there looked like they hated their job.  Was strange. 

But great dogs nonetheless!  :)"}
{"text":"Not it sure if Nathan's is New York based, but Vegas is either not setting the standard that got them nationwide or its overrated. The hot dog, I will say was pretty good. From the reputation I expected better. The wings worked for 3am food too. However I had the blandness sandwich I have ever had the displeasure of tasting in my life with Nathan's Philly cheesesteak.  It looked amazing. But literally had less taste than paper. I'm not deterred from trying them again. Just not this one if it can be helped."}
{"text":"While in NY for the weekend, my fiancé and I stumbled upon a Nathan's.... and we were glad that we did! Great service and menu. We enjoyed our hotdogs and will be stopping in again."}
{"text":"This review is for the Nathan's that's located in the arcade area of New York New York.  There's a second Nathan's at this hotel which is in a different area.  I didn't eat at the second Nathan's  because unfortunately I had already eaten at the arcade location.  I and my guest had never been to NYNY before, so we didn't know where the Nathan's was located, so we asked an employee who said, \"It's up by the arcade\", so that's where we went.  Anywayyyy, the Nathan's we ate at was HORRIBLE.  Walked in around 10pm for a late nite hot dog, the place was empty.  Tables were not cleaned off, napkins lying around, etc.  We ordered the foot long hot dog to split ($9).  We were handed a gray looking hot dog that hadn't been near a grill, slapped on a very low quality cold bun (supermarket or worse quality bun). 

We sat there looking at this pathetic awful  hot dog that didn't even resemble the fabulous Nathan's hot dog that I had had last year at another casino.  We were both totally perplexed by the low quality of this thing.  It just didn't seem like Nathan's to serve stuff like this. The next day, we happened to be looking for the Houdini magic shop which is on the upper level and by sheer accident, walked by the SECOND Nathan's.  No one told us there were two in this hotel!  Note to NYNY:  when your employees are asked \"where is the Nathan's?\" , they should let guests  know there are TWO.   

The second Nathan's looked wonderful, with the dogs grilling so that customers could see them .all sizzling and wonderful, and the place looked clean and normal.  We were so disappointed that we wasted $9 on a hot dog that shouldn't have even been sold to anyone.  Nathan's needs to either step up their game at the arcade location, or close that location.  Even though we didn't eat at the second location, it definitely looked a million times better than what they were selling in the arcade.  Word to the wise:  don't eat at the arcade location!"}
{"text":"I usually come to Nathan's a lot when I'm down here in Vegas. Their pricing is fair considering most food places in Vegas is pretty pricey. There are many different Nathan stores here in Vegas since it is a huge franchise. As you can tell by their name, they are mainly famous for their well known hot dogs here. Their menu is fairly simple. They have hot dogs, burgers, salads, and fries. For today, I'm going to be reviewing their fries and hot dogs. 
Starting off with the fries, I ended up ordering chili cheese fries and bacon cheese fries. These fries are fat crinkle-cut fries. I'm usually not a fan of crinkle-cut fries (waffle fries all the way) but the fries I had here was executed perfectly. Fresh, hot, and yummy. The bacon was a bit burnt with my order. The chili was decent, nothing to worth remembering it. The hot dog, again, was not really the greatest meal here. Hot dog was a bit too salty, fluffy buns, and the way it was executed was sub par. I much rather prefer a hot dog from either Costco or at Wienerschnitzel. That's as truthful as it gets. 
To wrap things up, I like their fries much more than the hot dogs here. Maybe if I come back one day and try this place out again, I'll definitely update this review."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly but the bacon cheese dog actually had a craft single and one piece of bacon.... it looked nothing like what was advertised. Nathan would be disgusted."}
{"text":"Came by as this was the closest food place on the way back to Monte Carlo. Not sure if it was because I just lost a poker tournament or pure hunger but this place was pretty good, especially the fries. Altogether it was only about $7. Good late night snack."}
{"text":"Tried Nathan's after leaving wet republic. I tried the Philly cheesesteak with bacon. It was everything I was hoping it to be specially after hours of partying hahah. 

It was a huge portion with tons of meat mixed with sautéed onions, green peppers, mushrooms and of course plenty of fatty bacon. 

The bread was lightly toasted with butter and it was crispy from the outside and nice and fluffy from the inside. 

You can get the nacho cheese included or as I prefer on the side. It's about $12-15 per person including a drink. Next time I will be trying the famous hot dogs hopefully there good too."}
{"text":"Well idk if this is the right nathans but I'm just writing about the deep fried twinkies and oreos at the one in downtown and it was so good after a night of partying.  The line was quite long and filled with party goers filling their alcohol bellies with go good ol fried greasy goodnesses."}
{"text":"More like a 4.5 because this was my first nathans hot dog from a real nathans stand and it was so moist and juicy.  The bun was just ordinary but with that hot dog and all the condiments it was mmm mmm good! The crispy crinkle cut like fries were also very good and nicely seasoned.  It was a bit pricey for the meal but overall it was worth, plus its vegas so idk how much it cost elsewhere but good job!"}
{"text":"I have stopped here before several flights out of McCarron. My go to is a Sausage, Egg and Cheese Sandwich and Coffee. It's quick and tasty (I like it more than an Egg McWhatever). I also love their Lemonade. Customer Service is a little inconsistent."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting, on Sunday night may 27th , 2018 I ate the chicken sandwich there and I got food poisoning from it . Non stop throwing up! I will never step foot there again!!!! Also they charged me to add tomatoes and lettuce to my sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of a dump nestled in the basement of Bally's. I'm not going to hate on a Nathan's because I love their hot dogs. But for reals, if you are in a hurry and don't want to spend a lot and you just happen to be downstairs during your stay at Bally's, this is a joint that will hit the spot. The hot dogs and fries are served fresh off the grill and out of the fryer. Other than that, it has that grimy, loud, New York street corner feel. I recommend staying away from the salads. 

And that's all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for a personal business trip and needed something quick, easy, and fast. The MGM Grand food court offered four to five different places to eat and I chose Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs.

I ordered the Combo - two standard Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs, fries, and a drink.  It came out to almost $12....WOW....expensive for simple hot dogs, but it was decent filler food.  I actually thought the prices are actually reasonable due to the close proximity to the MGM Grand Convention Center and of course the area is a tourist trap.

Three stars is a decent rating for what I needed this restaurant for...maybe this review is more for the MGM Grand Food Court for the convenience to the convention attendees like myself."}
{"text":"I was standing in front of the counter waiting. Another customer comes to the left of me and immediately gets his order taken.  The girl then puts up a sign to the left saying\"order here\".  She could have just told me to move 3 feet to the left instead of ignoring me.  I left  and went to the place to the left and got my breakfast sandwich there.  She clearly saw me there before the other customer came over."}
{"text":"I was originally planning to grab a hot dog since that is what they are well known for however I followed the lead of my friends and ordered a burger instead. I feel confident that a hotdog would have been a great choice but when testing out a new spot you can usually never go wrong with a burger. When in doubt order a burger. So 1 bacon cheeseburger with everything on it was ordered alongside crinkle fries and homemade lemonade. The fries were hot and tasty. Sure I had to add a little pepper and they scorched the roof of my mouth but paired with ketchup they lived in holy matrimony in my tummy. The burger came wrapped in paper and my initial reaction included shock from the appearance of the child size burger placed in front of me. One of my friend's asked the staff about the reduction in size. Now although the burger did not look like it was enough it turned out to be the perfect size. The toppings were fresh and the burger was very good. Also the bacon was cooked just right. Not too soft and yet not too crisp. The only thing I was not a fan of was the lemonade. It was a little tart and resembled Minute Maid despite the fact that it was freshly made. Will I eat here again? Of course. Next time I will surely grab a hotdog. Now I have my eye set on the Coney Island location. I mean that is where it all started, right?"}
{"text":"First off, major props to the great Kobayashi and reigning champion, Joey Chestnut.  Just the thought of eating that many hot dogs in the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating contest is both crazy and gag-inducing, so kudos to them for (literally) being able to hold all of them down.  However, now that I've tried Nathan's hot dogs for myself?  Well, let's just say I went from impressed to down right amazed...

While I had never anticipated checking out their food court neighbor, Pan Asian Express, a part of me has long wanted to try Nathan's.  Though I had heard a lot of tepid things about them, I'd always been curious about what made their hot dogs so \"famous\".  So, considering how unlikely it is I'll visit their flagship spot on Coney Island, and since I needed to be back at the conference center, this seemed as good of a time as any to check them out!

Despite how the menu includes other offerings like like cheesesteaks, burgers, and salads (?!), there was no question what I was going to get.  However, since the basic one seemed so plain (and expensive) for the money, I opted to go with their BACON CHEESE DOG ($7.98) and a side of CRINKLE CUT FRIES ($3.98).  

The short version?  Both were awful.
The longer version?  Both were really, really awful.

For one, the hot dog didn't look all that appetizing.  I figured they'd use cheese sauce/whiz, but I was expecting bits of crispy bacon, not two stripes of greasy, mealy bacon.  Even still, beyond that and the whiz (which was kind of gross), the hot dog itself wasn't very good - neither juicy nor flavorful.  As for the fries?  They tasted like the old oil they were \"fried\" in and were very soggy.  

Like nearly all of the other spots in MGM Grand's food court, Nathan's is one of the cheaper places around to find something to eat.  However, you'd be far better off spending a bit more somewhere else.  It's nice to save a few bucks, especially on The Strip, but there's a difference between being cost-conscious and being cheap and stupid.  Pass."}
{"text":"She said...\" Eh i dont know if this is the right nathans or not, but it was in the palms food court. Not good at all, and way too expensive for the amount of food you get. So does this make sense....we got 3 hot dogs, one hot dog as a combo but they were all the same price. pretty lame, go somewhere else if u wanna pay 30 bucks for lunch for 2.\"

He said, \"So here we go with \"world famous\" again...maybe world famous rip off? so you can order a $5.95 chilli cheese dog or a $5.95 chilli cheese dog combo..apparently its the same price. We tried to tell the manager and she was confused. Maybe the smell of hot dogs got to her..or she just didn't care. Very overpriced for a bunch of meat mashed into long cylinder. What a joke this place was.\""}
{"text":"Good cheap lunch after a long poker tournament. $10 bucks for a chili cheese dog, fries and a coke. Adequate, not something you can get everywhere and didn't feel price gouged."}
{"text":"Old fries covered in cheese and bacon. My expectations aren't very high from fast food places in airport but this experience is fighting hard for worst. I had to wait about 5 minutes while the two employees flirted with another airport employee trying to figure out how they could give him free food. They finally figured it out because another customer had to leave before his food  before it was made. I hope he was able to get his refund. I then proceeded to get my old fries and they were boxing it in a hot dog box because they were out of the appropriate containers. As they were still going on about their 'shared boo' and when he was coming back for his burger. I told them thank you and went on my way. I hope their 'shared boo' enjoyed his food more than I did."}
{"text":"My family and I had an afternoon snack, and we shared the 2 hot dogs with fries combo. One hotdog had the works - ketchup, mustard, onions and relish while the other was plain and we added ketchup for our daughter.  It was our first time having Nathan's Famous hotdogs.  Our food was made to order and served hot.  The hotdogs were good and the fries were thick crinkle cut fries and tasty."}

{"text":"Not the place you thought you would find in a well known spot like the MGM Grand, first lets just say the food is eatable cause half the people who will eat here is either drunk or too poor to eat elsewhere. That said the price at Nathan's is not cheap,  it pars at the same price at a concession stand at an event center if not higher. I had the foot long chilli dog, (get your mind out of the gutter). And chiili fries. My drink was over filled with ice took 4 zips and hello? Where is my soda? Chilli fries was delicious and the foot long was not warm. there are other choices at roughly the same pricing move on."}
{"text":"Tiniest corn dog ever! I purchased one, assuming it would be larger than my thumb. It was not and I paid $5 for it! I returned and asked to pay an additional $2.50 since they sell 2 for $7.50. They denied my request. Though after a subtle dispute, the minions called their manager and offered me a 20% discount on the second full priced one instead. I felt raped; and by a corndog no less."}
{"text":"I love it here they food are the best in Vegas food in town Vegas definitely and coming back all times and defenitelly recommend to all my friends and family's"}
{"text":"i'd eat just about anything late night after drinking, but 1/3 way through my chicken cheesesteak i realized that it was kinda gross and i should prob cut my losses.
boyfriend got a regular cheesesteak and felt similarly.
the bread was dry, meat was greasy and just not fresh tasting.  there wasn't enough ketchup in the mgm grand to save this.

i will say however, the fries meet the nathan's standard so if you need some salty, fried crunchiness late night, i'd hit them up for fries only."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED.
I paid $11 for a tiny hot dog and chili cheese fries in a medium plate.
The hot dog was indeed tasteful and their fries were delicious but definately not work $11"}
{"text":"So for some reason they have donuts here now.  So oddly enough, I ordered a garlic pretzel and it tasted like, you guessed it, donuts.  Strange.  I guess if you want a donut at a hot dog place, this is the place to go, but otherwise steer clear."}
{"text":"Ate at this place and was over charged. when i checked my receipt to see why i paid $18 for tenders and fries and noticed the register calculated my check incorrectly."}
{"text":"I ordered the beacon cheese fries for the first time there ok I'm not really a big fan of the cheese they use, but I must say their pink lemonade is delicious :) and their also very efficient!"}
{"text":"I refused to give my business to this establishment a few years back when I repeatedly received VERY poor customer service (I know it's \"fast food,\" but the McDonald's next door is 10x better).  They have messed up my order or completely FORGOTTEN to make my order many times.  Really disappointing.

Well, for some reason tonight I decided to give it another try.  The cashier was semi-friendly, took my order and gave me the little vibrating number holder.  I ordered the chicken finger platter....I know that they make these fresh, but it took a looooong time.  Other customers came and went with their food and I still stood there, waiting.  Finally, after 15 minutes, they were ready.  I ordered (and paid for) a side of the cheese sauce, along with hot sauce and ranch.  None of that was in my bag when she gave me my order.  When I asked for them, she made a loud sigh and proceeded to get the items I requested.

The food itself was good and fresh.  The chicken fingers were crispy and light and the fries were good as well.

I am borderline 3 stars for this place.  Unfortunately, the prices are enough to bring me back to 2 stars.  I understand that it's the strip, but the McDonald's next door has similar prices to what you would find anywhere.  $11.95 for a chicken caesar salad is a bit ridiculous.  And if they were nice, I could even look past that....But rudeness and lack of attention to detail will bump you down every time.  Sorry 'bout it!"}
{"text":"Skinny lil hotdog, big bun, decent amount of toppings.  Best way to describe this.  IMO I think it's better on Coney Island NYC."}
{"text":"i am not a big hot dog fan, but Nathan's hot dogs are AWESOME!! they are just the right size! not too fat and bulky!! i'm a bit surprised that most of the nathan's locations are located inside a casino and usually takes a bit longer to find when it's your first time there...however, the one at NY NY isn't as crowded as the one across the street at MGM. we went here on friday night for some yummy cheap food on the strip! i decided to order something different this time since i always seem to just get 1 hot dog and a small order of fries.
i ordered the chicken wings and man can i say those are the BEST chicken wings ever!! perfect batter amount and fried just enough that it's not overly greasy!! my son ordered these a few months back when he was in town and he loved them so much we ended up eating them 2 days in a row!!!
if you get a chance to hit a nathan's, make sure you order the chicken wings! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"on May 5th, Saturday morning me and my son bought hotdog from Nathans. I was amazed by the way the cashier handle the people in line. She was so courteous and kept her smile to every customer. I saw her name tag, Julita. It's nice to experience those kind of wonderful people after a long flight. It makes me feel good."}
{"text":"We went here last month and I was just so dissapointed with the very bad service. It took 30 mins just to order a chicken salad and a hotdog. They were super understaff and they dint get it ready until we came up to the counter to ask of it was ready. Then sad thing they forgot the fries that comes with the order coz they were in a hurry to serve a bajillian customer! They just want to take all orders but were not even ready to serve it on time. If it was not only for our hotdog cravings then we wouldn't come to this place anyway."}
{"text":"I've had Nathans at the original location in Coney Island, and primarily in the East Coast.  The few times I have eaten a Nathan dog, it was a small dog, with a nice \"bite\" to it.

So to my surprise, I decided to splurge on a chili dog and it was an $8.95 foot long and the hotdog had no bite at all.  

I was disappointed in the dog, and sticker shocked at the price. I ended up eating 1/2 of it, and gave the other half to Stephen (or toss in the trash).

NOT a fan of the footlong."}
{"text":"The first time I had Nathan's was about two years ago because we got a free pizza or hot dog with the purchase of a drink. (weird right?!) Normally you get a free drink if you buy a hot dog! Anyways, once we got rung up we figured out why.. a soda was more than $3!? WTF! Oh well, the food was too good to complain.

Swung by for a delicious, artery-clogging lunch on my most recent Vegas trip. There is a Nathan's on the casino level but we went up to the sit-in restaurant on the 2nd floor (sort of close to the roller coaster). The food was just as good as I remembered.. their hot dogs are YUMMY. And some could argue pizza is just pizza, but for some reason their pizza is so good that it made my mouth water. I also ordered the philly cheese steak sandwich and upgraded the fries to bacon cheese fries for about $14 total. Kind of expensive, but dang that philly cheese steak was better than the one I ate in philly! Filled with meat, oozing with cheese and onions/peppers... pretty legit! I would skip the bacon cheese fries... I didn't like their fries because they are the crinkled kind."}
{"text":"Not the best Nathan's I've been too. It seemed to be a bit disorganized - the food was meh...."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why Nathan's got famous...

I know it's convenient to just go from the casino straight to food court; however, there's many other places that are better and worth your money if you venture out of MGM and go somewhere else. 

I got the 2 hot dog + fries with a lemonade, and it cost me $15. There wasn't anything special to the meal (not sure if I should be expecting that out of a food court). Hot dogs weren't that good. The actual sausage is a long needle than a nice plump one. I understand why the eating contests like these hot dogs since there just isn't alot of meat. When I picked up the hot dog, the bread wouldn't stay together either. Nothing special about the lemonade. 

I tried you Nathan's. Meh I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Yo people below me are haters. Nathans has good stuff..hot dogs are good..with cheese..the fries are good..I liked this location because it's next to hot dog on a stick..lmao so I was able to get their lemonade and enjoy it with my nathans meal. On some Kobayashi type of shiii."}
{"text":"Love Nathan's every time we go to Vegas. Their French fries are to die for.
Service is good and fast. We've gone to the one in Luxor,MGM and Bally's 
We always get the Philly Cheese steak and a side of fries.
Just make sure to check the hotels for their hours- their is most of the hotels on the strip.
And don't forget to grab your coupon off of your placemat before throwing it away too.
Never disappointed when we go- I recommend everyone check them out when in Vegas"}
{"text":"I ordered a plain hot dog for my daughter. The hot dog was shriveled up... looked like it had been sitting out for hours.. maybe days. I expected more because #1.. it was NATHAN's.. and #2 I paid almost $5 for a plain hot dog!
I will never ever go back to this place."}
{"text":"Too expensive here...

$9 for hot dog and fries?!
$12 for philly cheesesteak and fries.

Everything tastes good but nothing over the top great."}
{"text":"Located inside the Bally's food court.

Make sure you find and use the BOGO 50% off coupon that they give away on the trays of Pan Asia, Nathan's, and Johnny Rocket's.

That discount will help make your food taste better. The dogs are better than your average dog, but the fries with cheese aren't anything special (too soggy for my taste)."}
{"text":"Very clean place, manager is very kind and friendly. 
I was helped by Manager and Justin, very fast and polite. They seem to have great team work and customer service. Food is pricey but good and taste fresh. 
Bacon cheese fries are recommended."}
{"text":"Nathan's is franchised, & celebrating over 100 years.  

I like an occasional Hot Dog, but I really didn't taste the difference in Nathan's, for the money.  

The Bacon Cheese Fries were tasty & special.  No wonder they're so popular.   

Surprisingly, nearby Diners had filled their trays with Chicken Wings, Philly Cheese Steaks, Burgers, & Pizza made by Nathan's.  Who knew?  I will visit again & branch out."}
{"text":"Usually visit once during a LV stay. Go to LV about once a year. Their quality remains steady and they are true to the taste of Nathan's on Stillwell Ave. in Coney Island.  I will continue to return, as long as they keep the food tasting good. Had a frankfurter and fries. My wife had a burger. She loved their burger. Consider me a happy customer. 

My father is from Coney Island and started taking me to Nathan's in Coney Island as soon as I was old enough to eat solid food. I am glad that Nathan's is still around and has not closed, as most places from my childhood have closed."}
{"text":"Great prices great food! i highly recommend the chicken Philly! that sandwich and the fries are so delicious!"}
{"text":"When I first tried Nathan's at New York, New York Hotel in Las Vegas as a midnight snack, I absolutely loved it!! Then the following year, we tried it at MGM Grand and it was a huge disappointment. It looked good but the dog had no snap to it!! And the bread fell apart, which is one of my pet peeves when it comes to a hot dog. A bun should never, ever break!!! 

One positive thing? I ordered grilled onions (it's not on the menu so you have to ask) and they were the best part of my meal.

Maybe I need to go back to NY-NY Hotel and try theirs again."}
{"text":"Nathan's has the better hot dog in Vegas. It lived up to its billing for sure. The dog was fresh a had a nice crunch to it. Just plain with some mustard or ketchup and you're good to go. Get 2 if you're hungry. I noticed they had pizza and other items on the menu but I would recommend the hot dog if you're a first timer. I wasn't able to try the fries or other sides but they seemed pretty fresh. As with other Vegas food establishments, it wasn't cheap. However, the dogs were much better than Pink's in my opinion."}
{"text":"woke up late and i really want a quick breakfast and got a really bad service and equally lousy food at nathan's in the las vegas strip food court.  i have to say \"i want 2 waffles\" 4 times before the bilingual server got my order correctly. my coffee didn't show up on my tray, and the bilingual cashier told me she didn't get the coffee order. in my frustration i  went to starbucks accross the stall to get my fix instead of reordering nathan's coffee. the food is equally bad. the waffle is soggy, the bacon is hard, and the biscuit didn't come with butter or jam. i should have gone to mcdonald's, 2 stalls away for half the price."}
{"text":"compared with the nathan's I had at the palms after the bjork show, this dog tasted like it had been cooked days before, maybe years - still, it's cheap for vegas and oh so tasty with beer."}
{"text":"When visiting the New York New York Hotel and riding the roller coaster, it only makes sense to grab a Nathan's dog. Expensive as everything on the strip, at least this was affordable and decent quality. They were decent. Had a nice \"pop\" when you bit through the skin. Same size as regular supermarket dogs. I sat here for a while when my daughter rode the coaster over and over again, so it was a decent place to eat a chili dog, sip lemonade, and chill."}
{"text":"Since moving to Vegas and giving up my grill I haven't had a good hotdog.  I'd like to say my trip to this Nathans satisfied that urge but I'm still searching for that one OMG hotdog.  It wasn't bad but my taste buds wanted soo much more.  (I eventually found a great hotdog off of a food truck see my other reviews for that one) 

I ordered a plain hot dog; a chili cheese dog and a side of fires; the dogs were ok, decent flavor and the buns weren't overwhelming (important things in building a great dog). On the Chili one it was a mild Chili but the richness of the beef mixed well flavor of the dog. 

The fries were weak/soggy but I knocked some of my chili onto them; ate them with a fork and enjoyed them all the same.  I didn't pay that meal as my buddy picked up the tab but I thought it seemed a little excessive for three hotdogs two drinks and an order of fries.  I'm assuming it was high due to the location and overhead cost but as long as you aren't pinching pennies this is a good spot to stop in for a meal on the go."}
{"text":"I was in a bit of a rush so I thought, why not grab a dog at Nathan's  I ordered the classic hot dog with Grilled onions and sauerkraut. It was a very good hot dog. This place like most of the places in the MGM food court aren't always the fastest, but that can be expected for a busy place. $6 is a bit pricey for a hot dog, but again it's the MGM food court. All and all, it's not a bad option.

Check them out."}
{"text":"Had a chili cheese dog and a philly. Got food poisoning and was vomiting for hours next morning. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I love Nathan's hotdogs. The staff at this particular location is really what is special about this place."}
{"text":"?7??????????????????????????????????????$1?????????????????????????????????????????????sbarro???????????????????"}
{"text":"Poor quality. Bread was dry and hotdog tasted like it had a plastic coating. Way overpriced and over rated."}
{"text":"When I went to Las Vegas with my best friend from Jakarta who hadn't been to the U.S. in 15 years, she asked me to include a few American fast food chains in our culinary endeavors. Since we were staying at the Wynn, we ended up across the street at the food court on our first day - the only day we didn't have reservations made. And I quote, \"Going to Chippendales is WAY more important than dinner.\"

We ended up stopping at KFC for boneless fiery buffalo wings and Nathan's for their chili cheese dog and crinkle cut fries with cheese. The crinkle cut fries were SO good (seemed fresh) and the chili cheese dog was good but not memorable enough to crave again when limited to the assortment at your typical food court. The boneless wings, on the other hand... suffice to say I didn't hear the end of how good they were (even after a mediocre meal at Charlie Palmer's Aureole and a delicious one at Todd English's Olives).."}
{"text":"At a conference and this place was convenient. So two stars for that.  Had a foot long with fries.  

Dog was ok but bun was fully split into two pieces which mad handling an issue.  The fries were well under done.  Sadness.  This place could be a 3 but care and attention to detail was really lacking.  They were not even that busy.   

The Good
All beef dogs

The Bad 
Fully split bun. 
Under done fries. 
Servers just going through the motions.  

The Ugly
20 bucks for a dog and fries."}
{"text":"This is the one located in the Venetian food court and I have to say keep on walking by.  How can you mess up a bun?!?  Really stale and must have been in the bun warmer FOREVER!  Dog was alright, but couldn't get passed that stale bun.  I have had Nathan's in New York and they would never serve anything that shibby."}
{"text":"Chili cheese fries and a root beer every time we visit here after the arcade. The fries are crinkled crispy fresh and smothered with cheese and ground beef no bean chili perfected ratio. Service is great, tables are clean and there's a tv with sports, in this case was the nfl draft"}
{"text":"I think if I had to pick between overpriced Nathan's and overpriced Bonanno's, Bonanno's wins. I couldn't go to McDonald's next door out of principle, but I was sorely tempted."}
{"text":"You will not see this location of Nathan's Famous from the street.  They are located inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.

We visited the Las Vegas Convention Center 3 days in a row to watch my nephew's basketball tournament.  During that time, Nathan's was the only place open inside there.  Suffice it to say that they were very busy those 3 days.

Their hot dogs, french fries, and lemonade are okay.  Prices are a bit steep, but that is to expected inside the Convention center.

Overall, not a bad place to eat when you are here."}
{"text":"This place had other stuff other than dog's which I liked because I ended up getting a cheese pizza. What?! You can see through the clear windows and it looked tasty! Even at a hot dog place. The prices were just right, for Vegas standards, so this is my future secret gem, because it has a soda fountain with free refills, so if you were smart like us, but not lazy, keep your large soda drink that you paid five bucks for and keep coming back throughout your stay! We were staying at MGM which is right next door so it would make more sense that way and especially if you were staying at NY NY. Otherwise, disregard my comment! They have salads, chicken, pizza and dogs of course! A must try! The food comes pretty quickly, since they make it for you after you order, and they bring it to your seat! Classy touch!"}
