{"text":"Well well well! I was pleasantly surprised with this family run pizza place. I was beside my parents house and needed to pick up dinner for the house... I usually go to the Wingery which is right next door but I decided to give this place a chance. The pizza was way beyond everyone's expectations! Way better than pizza pizza! Great amount of high quality cheese and The wings were fresh, hot and delicious! Amazing prices, especially if you're doing a walk in special. Customer service This will now be our new go-to pizza place! You've gotta try it!"}
