{"text":"This was our first experience here and it was outstanding. Immediately when we walked in we were greeted with a warm welcome, and a very nice explanation of the menu from our server and the different types of ramen they have.   This is hands down one of the best ramen places we've been to. This place is locally owned and we had received nothing less than genuine hospitality!   The food was delicious and came out super quick, so if you're hungry and want authentic ramen then this is your new go-to place. We had ordered the tonkatsu ramen, the shoyu ramen, and the takoyaki appetizer. All of which were delicious.   The tonkatsu ramen was very rich, the shoyu ramen had so much flavor, and the takoyaki was very enjoyable with a light sweet sauce."}
{"text":"This place is the kind of restaurant you go to if you need food for your soul. Everytime I go I leave wanting to cry, curl up in a ball, and sleep for days - in a great way! It fills my soul and I just want a bathtub full of their broth."}
{"text":"I think Hachi is the winner of ramen joins in the valley. It is the most authentic one and the service is always good. Love the fact that the noddles are different based on your broth, too. The location is a bit weird (at a plaza where most are there for a Home Depot) and some may not find the trip worthwhile, but if you are in the area this us the place."}
{"text":"The service was okay not great. The place just opened so it could improve. They have no spicy ramen option. You can order a spicy condiment to put in your ramen but it's not really spicy. They have no chili oil and standard things like soy sauce you have to ask for. The ramen was good but I was not blown away. Tampopo on McClintock is better with better execution."}
{"text":"The Tonkotsu Ramen broth has a lot of flavor and the Karaage chicken was flavorful and juicy.  Service was great.  Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Ok ramen. The gyoza are not really better than store bought. The chicken kara age was quite delicious, but I feel they stiffed me on a spicy miso ramen, was supposed to be included as a side item and was not, perhaps they misheard, but it wasn't busy at the time.  Mandarin speaking staff. Still trying to get their feet underneath them."}
{"text":"Not impressed with their ramen.  Their broth was for the most part okay.   Their noodles on the other I feel like it's stored bought.   I think their are a bit in the over priced side for basic ramen. Broth wasn't most disappointing part was half of an boiled egg really?!? Tampopo ramen is hands down is still my favorite ."}
{"text":"A+. Nice job for authentic and delicious ramen. I am happy to eat here and can recommend it to anyone who wants real a Japanese ramen restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Hachi Ramen today with my two kids and some friends. We ordered Karaage (Japanese styled deep fried chicken), and it was sooo good I couldn't resist! We also ordered ramen, and they  were real Japanese traditional style Ramen ,the  meat was soft and tender, and the egg had such a flavor blasting taste, with soft yolk. This place is definitely a place you would want to come to with your friends and family."}
{"text":"I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and chicken Karaage.  Amazing soup! Karaage is very juicy inside and very crunch outside. Waitress Iko was very nice customer service. I would try Miso Ramen next!"}
{"text":"Hachi Ramen reminds me that simple can be delicious. Their menu doesn't offer you a million options to get lost in. They have 3 broth options (tonkatsu, shoyu,, miso), they only have pork, and they only have a few sides (edamame, gyoza, karaage, takoyaki). But this focus on only a few things lets them do it RIGHT.   I've had their Hachi Special ramen and the Karaage (a japanese version of fried chicken). The broth for the ramen is pretty magical. It's got little bits floating in, and some pools of melted fat floating on the top. Basically, it's what'd you get if you yourself boiled down pork or chicken to get a broth, and then you kept adding to it over time.  The pork has good fat content, and is decently thick in cut. This most certainly is not shaved meat.  The black mushrooms and bamboo shoots add flavor and temperature variance to the bowl (they are served cool).   The Karaage is something I quite enjoyed. Karaage is japanese fried chicken, and the batter and cut of the meat have to be right. The batter is supposed to have a crumbly/fried texture and lightly spiced, while the meat needs to be juicy inside. And Hachi has it down to a art. Which I'm quite pleased about, since my previous go-to japanese place has recently ruined their karaage with a completely wrong batter.   For a first visit, I'm quite pleasantly surprised. If you are looking for a good simple ramen, Hachi is the place to visit. At the very least, you should definitely give this place a try, and form your own opinion on it.   Disclaimer: I am a self-admitted salt addict. I put salt (or shoyu) on everything. For my personal preference, I think the karaage and broth could use a little additional salt. But that's why you have shoyu on every table, so it doesn't detract from my review."}
{"text":"The best Tonkotsu(pork broth) ramen in Phoenix area. Kitchen appliances and tables remind me Ramen restaurant in Japan. Appetizer such as gyoza(dumpling), karaage(fried chicken), are very tasty too."}
{"text":"The BEST ramen in Phoenix. They feature tonkotsu, miso and soyu flavored soups and delicious pork in ramen. The owner has trained in Japan before coming to Arizona and the quality rarely sway dramatically compared to other ramen restaurants when the owner is away."}
{"text":"Unfortunately disappointing.  Flavor of the soup was stang tasting. The presentation of the calamari with pieces on top to appear to be moving? Pricing is high, bowl of soup and appetizer was $20! I will not return :("}
{"text":"Really really good stuff. No msg in food according to chef. Everything was fresh. Would definitely try again"}
{"text":"Best Ramen I have had yet. The prices are reasonable and the owner is very friendly and helpful if your unfamiliar with an item on the menu."}
{"text":"very happy about this spot, have tried a few others in az and were too greasy, msg tasting.   brought me back to japan, was very nostalgic, and it was awesome to talk to the owner and hear about his experience in japan studying ramen! makes me want to brush up on my japanese :)  I am no expert but when i was staying in nagoya japan, tonkastu was my favorite and that is what i tried here. it was so tasty and delicious, i added some spicy paste and it was such a yummy balance. very happy this place is here, sending many blessings to their success!! arigato gozaimashita!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! I had been looking for a ramen place to go to.  Great birthday place to visit!!  Food was really good as well."}
{"text":"Love the ramen. Love the takoyaki. Two combo meals can feed out family of 5 (2 adults and 3 kids under 12). So glad this place is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Visited 2 times in a week! A ramen joint specialized in ramen! Owner (my guess) put in a lot of effort into the broth and egg. My first visit found the broth too salty to my liking, and the owner promptly added more broth to tone it down. Perfect. Noodle was cooked to perfection, chewy yet yummy. Giving it a 4 stars because today the broth had a hint of \"porkiness\"... charsiew meat was excellent though!"}
{"text":"I chose this hidden gem for my birthday dinner & Hachi Ramen did not disappoint!! Watched way too much Naruto with my husband enough to want to try miso chashu ramen lol  Did a little research on the place & also read in the Phoenix new times that this was the spot for some authentic ramen. So why not!  From the outside it looks average but once you walk in the owner & his employees greet you in Japanese. You're seated & he asks you if you've ever had ramen, explains everything on the menu & answers any questions. From there you can order just a bowl of ramen or a combination meal. This consists of rice (white or fried chashu rice) the chashu, is really good pork belly. You get a side of friend chicken or octopus, or potstickers. They'll make you whatever you like fresh. Everything is pretty much made to order.  I got the Karaage combination which is the miso chashu ramen with fried rice and the fried chicken.  Literally, the ramen changed my life. I've never had ramen this good ever, the stuff we've been eating from the plastic bowls are all frauds lol  The ramen is a good sized portion and you can definitely tell the noodles are made fresh. The broth is so amazing & rich, full of flavor.  & the owner definitely takes care of you, our drinks were never empty and we were checked on periodically throughout our dinner to see if we needed anything. Definitely quality customer service.  He even made up a side of sesame balls when he found out it was my birthday. Never had them before but it was yummy also.  If you want to try authentic ramen this is your spot. They're closed for 2 hours midday but only because the broth for the ramen is made fresh daily. It's definitely worth the wait & the visit"}
{"text":"Guess who found their new ramen place in Arizona! Hachi ramen restored my faith in in shoyu ramen, and that I don't have to wait until I fly back to LA from my business trip to get decent bowl. My last two attempts I had to leave the bowl half full and still hungry. I drove over 30 minutes away from my hotel to this place, as it had the best reviews around. TOTALLY WORTH IT. I'm sitting in my car too full to eat more, but finding myself craving another bowl. I come out to Pheonix 1-2x a month for work and unless someone I trust can give me a solid recommendation, I will go nowhere else.  The broth was on point in heat and flavor, just the right amount of savory. Not the biggest fan of egg noodles unless made well. I confirmed my suspicion when asking the owner that they were in fact homemade from scratch. He learned how to make them in Japan, just like the couple who owns my favorite place in LA. Can't beat the texture and quality, when you taste it you just know it's superior to other places. AND THAT EGG....what the hell, that egg... I honestly wish I had asked how he prepared it, because it was better than any I've had before. Little bit of yolk, not too  runny but still tender.   Oh and never had Takoyaki before so I have no comparison, but theirs Was delicious too!"}
{"text":"So happy that I decided to try this place out! I chose the Karaage Combination. The chicken was tasty with a great crust. My tankatsu ramen was full of flavor and the egg had a unique taste to it. My teenage son couldn't even finish his because there was so much. That's a big thing to say since he's a teenager. Great place!!!!"}
{"text":"The best Ramen soup base I have had in the Valley! I lived in Japan for 4 years and this place is right up there with the rest of them! The staff are knowledgeable and proud to tell you about their food! I just wish I lived closer to it!"}
{"text":"The only good thing was that the food came out really quick. Our server can barely understand English which caused me to repeat everything 3x. The tonkotsu soup had flavor but with a bitter after taste, NOT comparable to California's soup. And the noodles are the straight type, not my preference. The takoyaki are not freshly made, it was precooked frozen from a bag. Overall it was just edible. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Tonkatsu ramen is the bomb! No MSG and broth is so good! The pork is melt in your mouth and not too fatty. The egg has a little infusion of soy, ginger marinade that is extra special! Owner talks to customers and takes great pride!  I will be back! I'd take a picture but I ate it too fast!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Friendly staff, from the moment you walk in you are greeted and sat quickly. They have a basic ramen menu with add-ons and sides. Food is excellent and fast. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Great service & good food. The ramen was just what I needed for fighting a cold. If you're in the mood for ramen and around the area, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Hachi Ramen's grand opening deal is pretty awesome - 40% off is a steal. I ended up getting their Hachi special, and it only cost $7.77.   Customer service was slow, but to be expected since this was their first time being open. Servers were very kind and well mannered though - I think they were all just kind of nervous or excited that they had a huge line out the front door.   Food portion is pretty sizeable. Three pieces of chashu, 3 seaweed squares, bamboo shoots, and a plentiful amount of noodles in comparison to some other places. Overall taste was decent, and for an Arizona ramen place I think it will hold its weight."}
{"text":"I recommend the Hachi Special Ramen, the broth was delicious and the noodles cooked just right.  We also tried the Chashu Fried rice which we'll definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Service was very good; however, the ramen wasn't up to par. As we walked in, we were immediately sat at the bar over looking their open kitchen. Our server was quick, friendly, and professional. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen. To me the quality of the broth is the deal breaker... their broth tasted clean, but it lacked the rich, creamy broth taste."}
{"text":"Super Yummy Tonkatsu Ramen Gyoza combo! Have a JPop sparkling cocktail too! So great! First time here but I will be back! Simple menu, great service!"}
{"text":"Beautiful authentic ramen here - I tried the tonkotsu on my first visit and can't wait to come back to try the shoyu and miso as well.   The tonkotsu broth was delicious and balanced - really flavorful yet not too heavy, just the right amount of fat and salt. Noodles were divine and chashu ultra-tender. I also ordered gyoza which were the best I've had in AZ. Beautifully crisped on one side and the filling was so juicy and packed with flavor.  Service was fantastic and I loved speaking to the owner/chef about his origins with making ramen, having trained in Japan. Grateful for this real deal ramen shop here in this area!!"}
{"text":"Great ramen spot in Tempe. Been here a couple times and they are continuously adding new things to the menu like spicy miso ramen. Good combo deal that comes with gyoza and rice for a comfortable price. Also have traditional sodas and a few traditional alcoholic options as well"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves the best ramen in Phoenix, and it's not even close.  The depth and richness of the broth is representative of the hours and hours of cooking down meat and bones, and the clean flavor is augmented by a good amount of delicious fat, enough so that your lips will smack with gelatinous goodness while you are slurping down the whole bowl.  The egg complements the dish by adding another texture of creamy deliciousness. The char-siu pork could have been a little more tender, but I have no other complaints about this dish.  The karage chicken was just okay, as it could have used maybe a minute or two more of frying and a little bit of salt and/or lemon to brighten up the flavor.    The owner asked us how the food tasted, and he told us that he opened up this restaurant after he recently came back from Japan, where he learned how to master the ramen cooking process.  I believe that the final product that he is serving reflects the time spent overseas, and I selfishly hope that enough customers will fill up his restaurant on a daily basis so that his business can succeed and that I may always be able to enjoy the best ramen in town."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Ramen I've had in the States. I'm dead serious. If you like Ramen, this place is a MUST. Also, the staff is incredible. They know me by name, always remember what I like, and are extremely professional and welcoming. I simply can not praise this place enough."}
{"text":"Unexpected surprise just outside of Chandler. Aside from the Temperature being 100+ degrees outside, well worth the visit. Tonkatsu Ramen was terrific, Japanese flavors (style) and well serviced by local business owner/operators. Will be back and try other Ramen options."}
{"text":"I discovered this place on Yelp and decided to try it. Nishikawa Ramen has been my go to ramen spot for some time. I also enjoy Tampopo. The problem I have with ramen places is the fact that a lot of their broths are too salty. I get it, it's ramen - it should be some sort of salty whether it's tonkotsu pork-based broth, soy sauce based, or chicken. However, I can only do so much. This place is authentic and not too salty! I love it! If you are like me and think some ramen is like sodium-overload, I highly recommend you try this place out. The only knock I have is the soft boiled egg had a slightly sweet taste to it which I am not used to. I will be coming here from now on for my ramen fix."}
{"text":"The ramen tasted pretty good, not spectacular, and not a lot of food for over $10 a person. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place has super delicious ramen. The staff is friendly.  My son is three and he was a little messy and they were totally fine with that. I will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT. The owner spent several years in apprenticeship across Japan. I never subscribe to the notion you have to be Japanese born and raised to be a master of ramen. This master is LEGIT.  The tonkotsu ramen is rich with undertones of chicken bone stock interwoven into the firm pork bone stock. This is the sort of deep impactful soup found in Western Japan. The noodles are Hakata thin style flour noodles and boiled to perfection, firm to every bite.  The miso ramen is a deep red miso baritone with several kinds of miso ... at least eight to include the dark earthy tones of Hokkaido miso and subtle delicate tones of Kyoto miso. The firm egg noodles are just the right kind served with Hokkaido Butter Miso Ramen able to take on this powerful broth.  The karaage is crisp and rich with the lightest flavoring of salt. The chashu-don ... please cut the nori down to 1/3, but the chashu is roasted brilliantly with the tender smoky tones it deserves.  There are several stylistic and flavor choices I don't quite agree with but it's personality and regional preferences rather than the food being incomplete. It is coarse around the edges but that's what makes ramen interesting, how each store refined over decades.  One of these is the amount of \"kotteri\" or richness in the broth.  I prefer a crisp, light broth with just a hint of it but there are establishments where it is deep and firm, which is the style Hachi chooses.  The owner and I had a good conversation about his love of ramen and yes he is LEGIT. I was going to just order the tonkotsu ramen 99% expecting this to be another \"You suck and Phoenix hates you\" experience but I finished two bowls in succession just to be sure (I've never been a fan of straight shoyu or shio ramen ever).  BUT THIS PLACE HAS AMAZING SHOYU RAMEN.    Mysterious random stranger that said try this place out I salute you, but I broke my calorie limit so it is your fault. I'm going to order another item off the menu again. Also ... how is the soundtrack in the store all 80s and 90s J-pop like Zard?  Back home in Japan I prefer udon over ramen. America has changed me indeed."}
{"text":"Great authentic ramen place, it reminds me of the ramen I had in Japan! The chashu was marinated and cooked perfectly, and both the chicken broth (Shoyu) and pork broth (Tonkotsu) are delicious!!! Like you can actually taste the chicken/pork in it!! Gyoza was okay, BUT!! The takoyaki was AMAZING! They also server some special drinks imported form Japan (which I personally recommend the melon Soda!) other then that there's also cream Soda, melon Soda, mango Soda...etc. I can't wait to try it all!  Definitely worth the 5 star!"}
{"text":"Maybe we went on a day that they were off their game, but I could not identify what I ate a being ramen. I lived in Japan for 31 years, and have never been upset after eating ramen, until I ate here. First, the noodles are pretty good, however I can not say the same for the broth. My wife ordered Tonkotsu, which was very watered down. It was like 1 part Tonkotsu and 9 parts water. You could identify the tonkotsu flavor if you focused, but you shouldn't have to do that. Tonkotsu should be thicker and leave a gritty taste in your mouth afterwards. It had little to no garlic in it, and true Tonkotsu needs a garlic flavor.   I ordered Shoyu ramen, but there was no shoyu in it. That was the most confusing thing to me. I didn't say anything about it because I was so confused by my wife's and my ramen. It tasted more like a chicken vegetable stew with noodles in it. I ended up adding soy sauce from the table. There was no raiyu either. The thing that upsets me most is that this establishment is owned by a Japanese person, who should know what ramen is supposed to taste like...that and I could have gone to any Safeway or Frys, picked up a $0.68 instant ramen, and it would have tasted better than what I had. It at the very least would have had shoyu flavoring. That is why I am upset.  The toppings and condiments were good. However, I am still upset, disappointed, and feel that it is an insult to the ramen world to call what we ate \"ramen\". I want to take the cooks to Ajisen or take them back to Japan and show them what ramen should taste like.  Perhaps they are trying to make ramen healthy...?...but ramen is not meant to be healthy. I am so confused by the experience. The only reasonable rational excuse I can come up with is maybe they were having a bad day, or made a very watered down broth....but shoyu ramen without shoyu is inexcusable. I am confused and debating never giving them another chance to prove this review wrong.  I might give them another chance and edit this review, but until then, this is the experience I had. I wanted the ramen to be good! I wanted to write a raving review, but I can't. It was not a good experience. I was very disappointed and felt let down."}
{"text":"I love the ramen here! So far the best I've tried in Arizona. Been there a few times now and I can definitely say that my favorite is the Shoyu ramen.   Service is great every time. The owner seems to love what he does and it shows it in his food. My new go-to place for ramen!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have driven past this humble restaurant several times and each time I would say, \"We need to try that place sometime.\" With the weather finally cooling down we decided it was time. Everyone is very friendly and I love the interior, nothing flashy, but still nice. We began with the gyoza which was very good. They instruct you to make your dipping sauce with items on your table. Very good and lots of flavor. My husband ordered the shoyu and I ordered the miso. I should state that we've had ramen at a few other places but this is by far our best. The broth in each was unique and the flavor very intense and clean. You could really taste the complexity in each broth. The eggs were so flavorful and creamy, perfection! Last and not least, the noodles were really exceptional they had a really nice chew and made the whole eating experience more enjoyable. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and both times the food has been amazing. The waiter gave great recommendations and I was nor disappointed. I've tried the tonkotsu and miso ramen and loved both. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I went a couple of days ago with my family and the people there were so amazing to us. They allowed us to order just the noodles they use for the soup for our daughter. They were always checking to make sure everything was going good. Truly best service and delicious ramen!!! I ordered the Hachi special with the shoyu broth and it was so delicious. Wish They had a location near me. But either way I will come back for more for sure!"}
{"text":"Yummmm. Had the pleasure of eating a quick lunch here and ordered the shoyu ramen. I drank every bit of the nice thick chicken broth with al dente ramen noodles, a half soft boiled egg, a slice of chasu and bamboo bits and one square of seaweed. Portion was smaller than other restaurants that I finished it all! $8.75. I've yet to try the other ramen soups!  Bar seating seems a bit narrow. Table seating is much better. Service is standard."}
{"text":"My new go-to ramen spot, without a doubt! I had the tonkotsu ramen and gyoza. The broth was rich and flavorful without being too salty, the noodles were cooked perfectly and the chashu was so tender and sweet (in a good way). The gyoza was a nice little treat and had great flavor as well. The owner was very welcoming and kind and I can't wait to head back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"It's good but \"????\" (Imaichi)  - as we say in Japan, it is just \"Not quite\" there. Noodles are great. Toppings are good. But the broth falls short, wich is too bad because it is the crown jewel of Ramen.  Apparently, the owner takes the time, effort and pride in this broth. And it shows. The broth has the wonderful glorious look to it with the promise of rich and flavor-packed goodness. However, as you take the first sip,  you are left perplexed and ultimately dissapointed. The broth has good authentic pork/veggie stock. It is the seasoning that is seruouely lacking. Needs more salt and flavor. I now tried all three flavors; Tonkotsu, Miso and Shoyu. They are not very distinguishable other than a very slight hint of miso or soy sauce (\"shoyu\") in the background. They are all missing salt. I hate to admit, but I had to do the dreadful insult of adding soy sauce to their Ramen.   Overall,  I am still happy that Hachi is here for the locals. This is the closest thing we have that resembles Ramen shops in Japan. Small menu, focus on a few special things and do them well. Hachi got the right model. They just have to do a little better. I still keep going back and am hopeful that I'll be surprised one day."}
{"text":"Love the pork and rice dish. The eggs in the ramen are unique and superb. Generous with the pork in the ramen. To be frank, I prefer Tampopo's tonkatsu broth and noodles. But this is a larger and more comfortable place to sit, esp. with a child. Very friendly staff and owner. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Hachi Ramen is delicious! It is just like being at a small ramen shop in Japan. They focus on their broths creating complex and amazing flavors. I have tried two of the ramen flavors, their small plates and desserts and have been floored each time. This is the best ramen in the state and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a great new ramen noodle pace in the East Valley. The broth is as good as places I have tried in London and Vancouver. Finally a ramen place that induces the cravings of a world class restaurant. I have already gone back! This is the real deal."}
{"text":"This place is new and could use some decoration, but it's clean and well-run. I gave it 4 stars because the ramen is outstanding and the prices are exactly what I'd expect. The noodles are fresh, the broth is rich and freshly made, and table options are perfect. I got the tonkatsu, which uses thin noodles that were perfectly cooked. My daughter got the shoyu, which had a thicker noodle and salty/smoky broth. I also ordered the gyoza, which were delicate and tasty. They did not serve them with a sauce, which was a little disappointing, but they honesty didn't need it. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Before all the self-proclaimed \"foodies\" say that this is ramen not as good as California, NY, Japan, etc, keep in mind probably the best broth there is to offer in Phoenix. So relative to that, they get a 5 Star already. Not pretentious or hipster like some of the ramen joints in downtown, just a plain ramen shop with no frills.  With that said, constructive criticism would be that the broth has too much garlic flavor and not enough of umami. Good body to the broth, but almost too much as it left a \"greasy\" feel from the combination of fat and collagen. Noodles were lacking some chew. If they used the noodles from tampopo it would be great (but tampopo broth sucks). Fried rice had good \"heat\" and was cooked well and fluffy, flavor was not bad, but missing something. Karaage chicken was ok, again, too much garlic and not enough other flavors. Price is more of $$ than $. Cost me $19 (includes tip) for a karaage combo with a fried rice side, no drink.  Staff were friendly, service was quick."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen place I've been to in Arizona. Not only do they have solid ramen, they also have great combinations that also allow you to get chashu fried rice and chicken kaarage with your ramen. I decided on the miso ramen to accompany my fried rice and chicken kaarage and I was very pleased! The broth was nice and rich and the chashu melts in your mouth! I think the chashu fried rice could have been improved if some pickled ginger was added to it. Their takoyaki was also spot on. I highly recommend Hachi. It's the closest I've had to the ramen I grew up eating in Cali!"}
{"text":"This was actually my first time eating here and I'm honestly impressed. The broth was so good; both the consistency and the flavor stood out to me. Not only was the broth flavorful, but so were the different additional ingredients. Each ingredient had a very distinct flavor and complimented the ramen well. My favorite ingredient would have to be the bamboo shoots. Idk what they did, but it was perfectly seasoned. I wish I got more of it However, I wasn't a big fan of the eggs because it was a bit too sweet for my taste buds. Other than that, everything else was delicious! I'm ready to come back for more"}
{"text":"Everything was so good. We ordered ramen and the two different kinds we got were both so yummy! We both loved the rice as well."}
{"text":"Really good, little bit pricey but I guess it's better than wasting your money down the street at Republic Noodle.  Tried different broths and they were all great. Loved the breaded chicken, I'm too American to remember the name.  The potstickers were bomb as well. Food was all excellent.  Only thing that was off putting was $3 for a 16oz bottle of soda.   Really good really authentic....Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Hachi Ramen is not my favorite ramen place but it does offer good food! I got the takoyaki (octopus balls) as an appetizer and loved the crispy batter on the outside and the octopus on the inside was tasty! This is something I'd only order to share as an appetizer though because I get tired of it after eating 2/3 pieces. Moving on to the ramen, I got the the tonkostu ramen and I was not fond of the broth. It was more on the creamy/thicker side and I prefer to have it be smooth. The noodles were thin and The egg was the best egg I ever had in my ramen and I loved the bamboo! Overall, this place was pretty good and I would come back again whenever I'm around the area."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past couple of months.  The menu is pretty basic, which makes ordering easier, but I am personally just not a fan of their ramen.  The last time I went we ordered the Takoyaki, which I was intrigued  by because I love octopus, but I was underwhelmed. It had a good flavor but the inside was still mushy and later on gave me some stomach troubles.   Overall if I were with someone who wanted to try it, I'd go, but I wouldn't be the one to mention it."}
{"text":"This is a really good ramen spot in the east valley, I went here when they first opened and after that it made want more and more. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with fried rice and it was actually really delicious. The broth is just right, not too salty, and not too bland. The noodles were tender and the toppings on the ramen were great. It's kinda hidden in the plaza with the Home Depot so keep a lookout for this place."}
{"text":"I have spent time in Japan and love Ramen. I have been looking for a good Ramen shop in Phoenix for quite a while. Well my Search is over. Hachi Ramen is a place that rivals anywhere I have had ramin in Japan or LA. The owner has a special heavy tonkatsu broth that is delicious and slightly creamy. My coworkers had the Miso ramen and devoured it nearly instantly. This shop will be a very frequent lunch destination for our team."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good ramen place and found this gem near work. Delicious and friendly spot that I will recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"The tonkatsu ramen here is the bomb! Rich broth and just the right amount of pork and pickle radish to fill your bowl. And that soft boiled egg is so good. I wish they give you whole egg but you only get half for normal order unless you pay $ to add on. But it's good price by itself for $8.95. They were experiencing a normal broth and a richer broth I definitely recommend the richer one. I also bought Fried Rice to take home for hubby which he enjoyed it very much.   I went there for lunch the food came out quickly too which is a plus.  Go there now..."}
{"text":"I'm only beginning to really crave ramen and I'm a bit particular. Hachi hits the spot. The servers are all very friendly and genuinely appreciate having you there. The ramen is solid, the broth nice and tasty. We usually get the kaarage, too. Worth the trip to try their ramen."}
{"text":"I feel like I didn't even know what Ramen was now that I have eaten here. Real authentic Japanese ramen and Gyoza. All house made and no MSG. Great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"Friendly service and the food came out very quickly. The ramen was good but not great. Our server was great though. I would maybe try it again in a couple months or so once they are more established. They were also out of a couple of items like miso ramen and strawberry Michu ice cream. The gyoza was ready either."}
{"text":"Love ramen? This is definitely a place for you to try. It's a small restaurant with great bar-like seating in front of the kitchen. It's very interesting to watch the chef cook the noodles and prepare the bowls. The J-pop music on the speakers was awesome!   The ramen is very delicious. The noodles are fresh and they have that firmness to it (not necessarily al dente) that is great in ramen dishes. The broth is delicious!  Although, I don't go out to eat ramen very often (I enjoy the cheap make-at-home Korean ramen) but at the next opportunity, I'll definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Needed some comfort food and needed a nice bowl of ramen.  Definitely one of the best ramen shops in thr Phoenix/Tempe area.  I would really like to fill out the review with a bunch of colorful words but all that needs to said is a bowl of ramen is like a slice of heaven."}
{"text":"I ordered the Karaeege (sp?) combo and it was cheaper that way. The chicken was crunchy. Rice was soft and chewy. The ramen tasted scrumptious with richness of the pork soup. The soft egg was salty thougn."}
{"text":"The food is kind of bland. There's other places 15 minutes away that absolutely destroy this place in terms of flavor. I also had a bad experience paying for the meal and had to ask a friend to pay for me. I handed over a Wells Fargo Visa debit card and was declined. I checked my account to see if it was my problem, but I had more than enough to pay. Who doesn't take visa cards?"}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had in Phoenix for a very long time. Tradition tonkotsu ramen, shoyu, and a fantastic miso broth are on the menu. The goyza is perfect."}
{"text":"The best Ramen place in town. 5 stars for food and service.  Ordered the Miso Ramen, Haichi Ramen and Tonkatsu Ramen.  Love the Miso Ramen, add a little chilli powder, gives a kick to the already tasty broth. Bradley came by to see how the food was and he is so passionate about his food.  Telling how he was trained in Japan just learning how to make Ramen from scratch."}
{"text":"Born out of the need for the owner, Bradley, to get good authentic Japanese ramen in the valley, he opted to just learn it himself, in Japan! and bring that authenticity here. If you want real Japanese style ramen with rich, unctuous broth, tender pork slices with nitamago, this is it. Literally. There aren't any other in this area.  They also serve takoyaki, this may become a favorite joint of mine."}
{"text":"Was surprised to find out another ramen place exists in Tempe that I didn't know about, so my fiancé and I stopped in ASAP to investigate.   The servers were nice, and wow that ramen came out fast. I'm personally not a fan of thin noodles (their noodles seemed to be the same as the noodles at Tampopo, for you other ramen maniacs), so that was a bummer, but I won't mark them off for a preference. My fiancé and I both got the tonkotsu and thought the broth was too salty and not consistent with our previous experiences of tonkotsu (broth should be white, etc.). HOWEVER (big however), their chashu was delicious!! Oh man, so good. I wouldn't come back for the ramen, but I might come back to try their chashu fried rice!   Overall an okay place with a few shining stars. At least worth a try for ramen lovers!"}
{"text":"Crazy good ramen!!  You have to try it all! The pork, chicken and miso are seriously good.... the spicy chili is a great additive to all the dishes! The broth in all the ramen dishes is the best! The service is top notch and it is a bustling busy bastion of amazing Japanese cuisine!!"}
{"text":"I love ramen, and the only thing this place brings to the starling Phoenix ramen scene is that it has thin noodles. The food is bland because the food is cooked separately from the broth. If you're coming here for a great ramen experience, stick to downtown Phoenix for the best spots. If you're going to come here, do it because you live nearby and not because you think you're getting a quality meal.  I also had a bad service experience, though I think the circumstances of my arrival may have led to some of it. Let me set the scene: my friends and I walk in right after a group of eight people were set up at their own table. Each of the 7-8 tables is already filled, even the bar. After waiting about 5-10 minutes, three spots open up for me and my friends at the bar. We place our orders: two bowls of ramen and one combo meal (ramen, rice, fried chicken and pickled radish). I receive the fried chicken, rice, and pickled radish about 10 minutes after we sat down, but we didn't receive our ramen for another 20 minutes... What? No. Awful. Who wants to eat their combo with only half the food, and or be the friend to begin eating while their friends are all waiting for their food? Just weird service timing and decision-making."}
{"text":"Friendly service about a close to Japanese ramen as you're going to get in Arizona. They also speak Japanese great place to practice if you're learning."}
{"text":"Tonkuzu Ramen met my standards. Hot spring egg is well made with nice flavor. Slightly salty soup for me but still very delicious. Highly recommend their takoyaki."}
{"text":"Soooooo good! Definitely the best ramen I've had in Arizona so far. I tried both the shoyu and tonkatsu ramen. The tonkatsu broth had a strong pork flavor which might be a little too much for some people, but I thought it was fine. Shoyu was delicious. Service was great and the place is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was awesome and we were given a little run down of how the place started and the cooks background in ramen. Check them out"}
{"text":"As a certified ramen nut I was stoked to see a new place opened near my house. I travel to Japan frequently so I have know what a good tonkotsu is supposed to taste like. Although the soup was good it wasn't knock your socks off good, but decent for Phoenix which has a pretty terrible ramen scene. The soup was a bit weak and lacked the depth and slight creaminess that is a hallmark of a proper tokotsu. Also the chashu was really small considering the price and was mostly fat with only a sliver of meat. Noodles were a bit overdone as well. The egg however was excellent. Hopefully they can improve some aspects of the dish and make it better. Overall not bad would probably try again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"If you want top quality ramen in Phoenix then this is then definitely consider visiting this place.  Not only is the ramen very good, but so are the appetizers (be careful the gyoza can be quite hot when you bite into them!), as well as the service!  I ordered the spicy miso ramen which was quite spicy but nothing outrageous.  You can, however, order the spicy sauce on the side to control how spicy you want your ramen.  The noodles and broth were delicious and the chashu was very tender."}
{"text":"Finding a Ramen place that serves broth that's not pork based is challenging in the valley. Hachi Ramen offers a chicken based broth so my husband and I decided to give it a try. We were welcomed as we walked in and seated immediately.   While browsing through the menu, we noticed that all the options had a piece of pork and pork fat in it. The waiter came to our table to ask us if we had any questions after he had served us our drinks. We asked about pork free options and he said they had the chicken broth and that they could skip the pork piece and pork fat. So we decided to go with that. The dish is served with an egg so I asked for mine to be without the egg. Since the dish now became just ramen, broth, green onions, bamboo-shoots and a piece of Nori, my husband was ok with that (with the egg). I decided to add corn and mushrooms to mine and I ordered a combo which is served with plain white rice, 3 fried boneless chicken pieces and pickles. We also ordered edamame and Takoyaki.  While we waited for our food, I checked in on Yelp. As a thank you for checking in, they offer sesame balls for dessert if you order food worth $30+.  The appetizers came out almost immediately. The Takoyaki was served with fish skin on top which I swear kept moving! Lol   The dish had a distinctive and delicious taste. It's basically a rice ball stuffed with octopus. It was very foreign to us but tasty. I didn't try the edamame but my husband enjoyed it.   Our bowls of Ramen came out shortly after that. They looked pretty good. I added some soy sauce to mine and tried it. It tasted good. We enjoyed the fried chicken. It had lots of flavor.   While we were eating, the waiter asked us to let him know when we are ready for dessert and we marked the offer as used.  When we finished eating, we asked for the dessert. 2 sesame balls were served. They looked perfect. When I looked up sesame ball recipes, I realized that the red paste that was in the balls was actually red bean paste. It tasted great.   Our bill was a little over $30 which is not bad. It was a good experience and the service was excellent. I just wish they had more non pork Ramen options so that they don't end up being meatless."}
{"text":"Just looking for something close by and found this place.  Got to meet the Owner during our dinner, he has an interesting story and a real passion for what he does.  Home made chashu, broths, and other elements.  Had the miso ramen, broth, pork, egg, everything was excellent.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great Ramen! No vegetarian options but they made vegetarian fried rice for my daughter. Great meal, great service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is great! The broth is so rich and flavorful! The service is also super! The staff is super friendly and really helpful. Also the kitchen staff even comes out to say Hi! This place is number 1! You got to come here at least once !"}
{"text":"I love this place. I went there for my first time today, and fell in love! I got the tonkastu ramen which came with a chashu slice (pork), green onion, bamboo shoots, black mushrooms, and a seasoned egg. First let me say this place has the best chashu I've tasted. It wasn't overly fatty, and I know some people like that, but I don't haha. It had a perfect charred taste to it. The noodles are the thin noodles that I LOVE! You can also get extra noodles on the side for $2.00 more, for when you're left with just broth at the end of your bowl ;) speaking of which, the broth. It's amazing. It's full of flavor, not super salty, and it's creamy. Even my picky eater boyfriend liked it! I am so glad Arizona is getting more and more ramen shops. I will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"So good. My ramen was so satisfying and tasty! The staff was really friendly and attentive too. We got to meet the chef who told us about going to study in Japan and making all of it from scratch! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"During a very intense ramen craving, I struck a deal with my husband to take me here last night. Not sure why I wanted it so badly but I'm glad I gave in, this place was delicious.   I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and we got a side of gyoza to try. The broth in the ramen had a velvety texture from the richness with flavorful pork undertones coming through. Noodles were a bit skinnier than usual ramen ones, although I liked them much better. I only felt the need to add a side of chili paste for extra heat and a dash of soy sauce since I love spicy, because overall the taste was perfect. Gyoza didn't come with sauce, you can make your own with the condiments which my husband was a little annoyed at, but we both agreed it was some of the best tasting gyoza we've had.   It's a small restaurant and there was only one guy playing waiter, yet he did an awesome job making sure we were taken care of. Super friendly staff and you can watch them cook behind the counter.  Overall I think Hachi Ramen deserves the 5-stars from our visit in my perspective. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Is this what Japan is like?   I have a dream of flying to Japan and eating ramen and sushi for every meal.    If ramen is this good, I'm going to a buy a plane ticket today.  I've had the pleasure of eating the tonkotsu and shoyu ramen and they are delicious. It's my favorite place to visit on a cold day when I go to work."}
{"text":"It was my first time venturing away from Pho and trying Ramen so I had no idea what I was doing. The chef (who studied in Japan for two years) came out and explained the menu to us very thoroughly. I got the Miso and he laughed at me when I asked if it tasted like Miso soup. It definitely did not taste like what you'd think for Miso at a sushi place or something and was fabulous. Everything was clean as well and the service staff very attentive. Glad we picked them for a first time."}
{"text":"As an avid ramen fan, I was thrilled to see another ramen restaurant open up in Tempe. I drove past the first 2 nights and saw long lines for the grand opening and decided to come back on Thursday. I ordered the Hachi Special and I have to say for $15 dollars after tip, I expected more. The broth was underwhelming, the noodle portion was small, and not really the type of ramen noodle I expected. The redeeming qualities were the 3 pieces of char sui pork, and the soft boiled egg. Although the portion of pork was nice, it seemed to be under-cooked and just not very hot. Even after being in the soup. Overall, I think I would go back and try a different ramen bowl. But if it's anything like this experience, I will stick with tampopo or Dozo. The best place I have had Ramen in AZ btw, is Hot Noodles and Cold Sake in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and I'm so happy I did! Loved it! The second I walked in Dante greeted me and asked me if I'd been there before. I said no. To which he grabbed a menu and took a couple of minutes to really explain and give me a break down of everything they had to offer. He was so helpful and you could really tell he is extremely passionate about his job and food. Super friendly service and fantastic ramen. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. I will definitely be back! So happy I found this gem bringing culture to Arizona. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Came here after a meeting and what a pleasant surprise.  I can't say I'm a Ramen expert but I've had my share of good Ramen in the Bay Area.  First, the service was attentive and friendly.  I ordered the special with extra egg and pork and added corn.  I'm so glad I did.  The egg was cooked in a perfect soft boiled manner with the yolk very creamy.  The Char Siu Pork was absolutely fantastic.  The layers of fat melted in your mouth with no heaviness.  Just pure heaven.  The owner cooks every thing on premise from scratch.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We tried the chasu fried rice, Hachi special ramen,  and takoyaki - it was all delicious!! I lived in Japan for 10 years and the flavors here were spot on. Can't wait to go back and try the other menu items. Oishii desu!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night during the Jets vs Bills NFL game. As expected, that game had absolutely no impact on the quality of ramen here.  Their cadillac dish here is the Hachi Ramen ($11.99 and $1.00 more for Miso broth) which is filling and rich with flavor. They seem to make most ingredients from scratch here (except maybe the corn). Egg topping is especially good. Meat is better than most ramen places. RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Ramen here is amazing. We came craving ramen and Hachi Ramen did not disappoint. You can't go wrong no matter what you get."}
{"text":"Good ramen!  Especially liked the Tonkotsu soup base and the noodles.  Takoyaki was tasty too.  Found our new ramen place before dance class for kids!"}
{"text":"We love ramen and we know ramen! This place serves delicious ramen and the owner and staff is super friendly! This place has earned the #1 spot for ramen  on my list!   Affordable and delicious"}
{"text":"eatable and decent taste, but not enough to catch the price on the menu. little too expensive for that small portion of the food. as a ramen noodle lover I do not recommend, because there r a lot more options and better Ramen noodle in that price range. my evaluation are only base on the food's quality and quantity. 2 start for the food. 1 star for the service and the cute and pretty Asian girl server. Lol!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, good ramen.Try the takoyaki. No wait time. Hidden gem in the home depot plaza."}
{"text":"I don't care what anybody says, this place is so good. First time here and I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and it was absolutely delicious. The broth was delicious as were the noodles. The owner actually stopped and talked with us and it was a really good gesture. Definitely coming back for the food as well as the family friendly service."}
{"text":"Great service and clean restaurant.   Tonkotsu was excellant.  Nice thick broth and with a little chili oil really hit the spot.  Gyoza was excellent and not overfried like some other places.  Will return!"}
{"text":"Came during their grand opening week for lunch and got seats within half an hour. This place is pretty small, similar to a Subway sandwich shop, so seating is limited (maybe 20 seats or less?)   Got the hachi special ramen. Most flavorful chashu of all ramen places in the phx area. It's a bit on the fatty side, which I'm super excited about. Egg was perfect as well.   Looking forward to trying the chashu rice at my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is my first experience here in Az. with Ramen. Will definitely return wonderful meal. And great service."}
{"text":"Good customer service.  We came because my son was craving for some ramen.  They don't have any vegetarian option but they modified the fried rice to accommodate me.  It was actually a pretty decent fried rice, just nothing special out it.  The ramen in the other hand was pretty tasty according to my son who has a thing for ramen.  The only downside is their menu is very minimal so maybe they should add vegetarian broth to the menu then we sure will come back more often."}
{"text":"Tonight my boyfriend and I tried Hachi Ramen for the first time! I had the Shoyu Ramen and my bf had the Tonkotsu and Gyoza, they were both sooo good and reminded us of the ramen joints in LA we used to go to. Price point is great considering the quality of the ingredients, and the service is excellent! The manager learned his technique in Japan and it shows through the balance of flavor in the broth  and delicious chewy texture in the noodle!  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The Tonkatsu Ramen was just alright. I have tried better but plan on trying there Miso Ramen next time I am there."}
{"text":"Good new ramen shop in Chandler. Came with one of the expats from Japan and we both liked it here.  Was here a week after grand opening and by then things got settled well and I enjoyed my lunch here. They still don't have a few things on the menu yet (gyoza or miso ramen).  I ordered karaage combination ramen. Order comes with a bowl of ramen of your choice, karaage, a bowl of white rice and a few pickled radish.   Karaage was cooked perfectly, great flavor, juicy chicken, deep fried just right to create nice texture on the outside.   I tired tonkotsu ramen and my colleague ordered shoyu. They served different size of noodles and I really like this ramen for tonkotsu. We both were taken back a little at first as shyoyu didn't have that traditional syoyu color to it but then remembered some of the iekei ramen uses white syoyu. Both tasted a tad watery at first but because of that I was able to finish the entire bowl of soup, which hardly ever happens. Especially Kyushu area ramen is too thick for my liking, I liked their broth.  Noodle was cooked good, I would have preferred noodle was bit harder (more texture to it) but I guess I wasn't eating fast enough for this kind of noodles.   Chasyu... oh wow wow wow, had a very nice flavor! Hadn't had that good and well flavored chasyu in a long time. I normally get tired of eating fatty pork belly after one but I thought I could eat more as they were cooked and flavored so well. Their egg was flavored well too. Could have had more than just a half came with standard order. Now I know, I should order extra as a side next time.  It wasn't as busy since we arrived shortly after they opened for lunch at 11am. Service was prompt and she asked if we agree on shared table before seating others at our 6 seats table. They use re-usable chopsticks, very environmentally friendly. (They even added disposable chopsticks for those who don't like reusable option). They put chopsticks in a container where you get your own from your shared table. Ive started seeing more and more of this type especially in Manhattan and LA. I like this concept, I hope more restaurant will catch up to environmentally friendly ideas.  Looking forward to coming back and hope they start serving gyoza by then."}
{"text":"Our experience here was great. The service was awesome & we even got to learn some words in a new language. The food however was not our favorite. The fried chicken meal was very temperature hot (good thing), however it did not have as much flavor as the server led us to believe. The ramen also, did not have much flavor which was a BIG bummer as it is a ramen place.  The best thing about our time there? Mochi! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I was jonesing some  soup decided to try this place out. Workers are wearing surgical mask even the greeter which didn't make it inviting. $11 for the portion you got was not worth it. Not much noodles the pork was cold the broth was tasty. It's sad when you can make better noodles at home."}
{"text":"Ramen expert here! Usually I try the tonkatsu ramen first at every place to see what the baseline is in order to judge their basic skills. So I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and it came out fairly quick. I approve of the noodles because most ramen I eat that are the best usually have the straight thin noodles that kind of resemble angel hair noodles. The chashu was very good! It was not tough and actually melted in your mouth. The other toppings of bamboo shoots and mushrooms complemented the noodles to make the mouthful pretty balanced. I thought there was a seaweed piece but it wasn't in the bowl. And the portion is smaller than other places. :( Of course, the final test is the broth. For a tonkatsu broth, I look for depth, consistency and of course... pork fat drippings on top of the broth. Unfortunately, there were not any drippings, but the depth and thick consistency made up for it. The broth reminds me of the broth at Dozo Izakaya which also has a thick creamy consistency. Overall, I'm approving this tonkatsu ramen because it is comparable to other ramen in California and Japan. BASICALLY, IT'S NOT WATERY BROTH. Not the best in the world, but in AZ, this is considered top tier. I think this place makes it to second place on my AZ Ramen List. Next, I will try their fancy ramen, the Hachi Ramen, which contains the whole nine yards of toppings. Hopefully it will not disappoint.  Also, I love that they have other items as well on the menu like takoyaki! Any place that serves takoyaki gets bonus points from me. :)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!  The broth was tasty and the service was excellent!  They were friendly, quick, and there is no MSG in the food, which is a bonus :)"}
{"text":"First time trying the place! The staff was very nice and I was greeted and seated instantly. The kitchen is basically in the dining room so you can watch them cooking. Your standard bowl of ramen is going to run you about $10, but it's more than just noodles and broth. You also get meat, eggs, and veggies (at least for the chicken version I ordered). It's a great little place if you love Japanese ramen."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen!  The broth is great and not too salty.  Very good chasu and the soft boiled egg is particularly tasty!  We tried shoyu and tonkotsu and will be back to try the miso recommended by the staff/owner.  Very friendly service!  Our family is adding this to our fav ramen place list ."}
{"text":"This is a great little ramen place. We ordered the Hachi special, the ramen combo, and sesame balls. All the food tasted great! The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The worst ramen restaurant I've ever tried in Tempe. I ordered Tonkotsu ramen. It took 5-10mins which it's total fine for me. The thin noodle is tasty and I love it. However the soup is so plain and makes me feel like they forgot to put some salt but added some corn starch to make it thicker. I think I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Pros: + Cheap for Ramen  Cons: - Ramen isn't that good  Would I come back: Probably. The location is strong.  Came in Tuesday ~ 5:30pm after work, thought I'd check this place out. I was the only customer there, which wasn't a great sign. Ordered the Tonkotsu ramen.  Quality was...mediocre. It wasn't the worst ramen I had by far (See: Ramen Master, Fort Collins CO), but it was clear this place wasn't passionate about ramen. The broth was weak for Tonkotsu, the noodles weren't ramen noodles (though it wasn't terrible), and the bamboo had the distinctive taste of the preserved cheap canned variety. Still it tasted ok as a whole.  I'm going to be generous and say 3 stars, because so far yelp hasn't revealed to me a possible better ramen place in the area and the people working there were nice enough."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place. I ordered a noodle bowl which was not hot, like warm at best. The noodles were the consistency of angel hair pasta, the broth was too salty; it was not very good.  I gave it three stars because the waiter was very nice, attentive, and we didn't have to wait long for our food to be served."}
{"text":"Very friendly, welcoming, and the chef/owner went beyond expectation and prepared a vegetarian fried rice for me after learning about my dietary preference; it was delicious and refreshing. My boyfriend stated this was hands down the best ramen he's ever had- he has the miso and every bite despite being very full. He also tried the traditional pork fried rice and called it life changing. Overall a great experience and we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Greatest ramen and gyoza. It is my third time to eat ramen here. Most valued ramen in Tempe."}
{"text":"I'm not very experienced with ramen but I got the special with gyoza. Everything was delicious! Will definitely be back when I get a chance. Maybe worth mentioning, my check for lunch by myself was $20 and again it was very delicious, so it's more than my typical lunch but was a nice self-treat."}
{"text":"Hachi was DELISH! I had the Tonkatsu ramen and my boyfriend had the Shoyu ramen and both were amazing! We both added a little spicy sauce to ours for some more heat but other than that they were great as is! They come with a lot of toppings already but you have the option to add more if you'd like. Very friendly staff as well. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Never-mind, I was raving about how great this place was but I wrote the review before we had digested the food. Both of us got food poisoning at this place. We were up all night shitting and puking. Never again."}
{"text":"I thought it was gonna be one of those fake ramen places where they use instant noodles and artificial flavorings instead of real ingredients (most sushi places in AZ will serve those fake ramen just FYI). But this place is surprisingly authentic and i will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Been looking for good tonkotsu ramen in Arizona and when I heard that some of our Japan vendors at work go to this place for authentic Japanese ramen, I had to try it out.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with the egg type noodles and the karage chicken. I absolutely loved the tonkotsu broth. It was nicely seasoned and had that great pork flavor. The egg and yolk with not only cooked well but had been marinated fantastically with soy and mirin. The noodles themselves were great with just enough chewiness to give me that texture that I love. The Karage chicken was also cooked perfectly and chicken was juicy on the inside.  Overall, if you're looking for fast friendly service at an amazingly authentic ramen restaurant in Chandler, Arizona, Hachi's a great choice."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place and was looking forward to eating here. Ramen needs a lot of love to do well and Hachi did not disappoint. The broth was flavorful with out being salty and good balance of sweetness with saltiness. The temperature of the broth was appropriately hot and steaming. The noodles were not overcooked.  The flavored egg was well seasoned with the semi-translucent yolk.  The bamboo shoots and good flavor and firmness. The takoyaki had a good ratio of starch and octopus and was very flavorful.  The Bonita flakes were dancing.   This is a great find for ramen in AZ. We will come back."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. The broth is rich and tasty but not salty! Love it! Cute little shop. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was our first experience with authentic ramen. It was amazing. Our server did a great job explaining the different dishes and we absolutely loved what we got. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came to the \"Grand Opening\" of this place from something I saw on FB. They open at 11am and I came around 1. They were closed. Went inside asked what was up because in their FB it said open from 11-3. The guy inside said that it was too busy. It was pretty full inside but there was empty seats inside still. I drove 45 mins for this just to be disappointed. Not worth the drive. Chances are they'll be closed."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen! Every time I try a new ramen restaurant, I always try their Tonkotsu first. I was not disappointed here. Super friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Very good Ramen. No too salty. I'm definitely come back again"}
{"text":"How could I possibly not come right at 11AM for the grand opening of a new ramen place!? Definitely worth it! Coming from San Diego, I'm an avid ramen enthusiast - I have my ramen joints based on what I'm craving that day (egg, noodle, broth, toppings, izakaya, etc.). Needless to say, I was stoked to see a new spot open up near my Arizona home!  I got the Hachi special, and tried a bit of the Shoyu broth, and was pretty impressed! Egg - This is SO well done and seasoned perfectly. If there's not a great egg, I will be skeptical of the ramen joint. So right away, I was excited to see the egg and it's yolky goodness. Noodles - very thin, which is how I prefer it. Also great portion of noodle! Broth - super flavorful and salty. I do wish there was a little more broth, since my preoccupation with taking photos resulted in a bad noodle:broth ratio. The Hachi broth was fairly creamy and not clear/watery. The chicken based broth of the Shoyu was also really good, but I personally prefer a pork base. If you like chicken base, the Shoyu is a great option! Chashu - YUM. The Hachi special comes with 3 thin slices and they're SO good! I also had some of the chicken (?) slices on the Shoyu, and it was so so so good.  Toppings - I love that they come with bamboo!  **My only suggestion is they add a spicy option.  Service, I recognize that I went on the first day and things are still getting hammered out. While getting our food took quite a while, I think it's because there was a packed restaurant and a line starting to form by the time 11:30AM. Servers were wonderfully friendly and ready to help.  I can't wait to see how Hachi does. I will definitely be here again, and I'm excited about a fruitful future together with this new ramen joint! ;)"}
{"text":"Service is good. Food comes out fresh. Broth is truly made from scratch and has just enough seasoning, not too salty.  Always a regular here."}
{"text":"It's our favorite ramen in town :)  Very flavorful, tastes like traditional Japanese style.  Chashu fried rice is delicious, too!  Yum!"}
{"text":"The service was good. The servers were friendly and efficient. The decor was simple, but that's neither good or bad. As for the food, the kaarage was good. So was the chasu. The noodles were decent. The downfall was the ramen broth. It was undeniably porky, too porky for my taste. A return trip would be unlikely unless I really wanted ramen and the other places are closed."}
{"text":"We LOVE hachi ramen, and go quite often! Hands down the best authentic ramen in the valley!"}
{"text":"I came here today and what a surprice. Their ramen was very authentic and tasty. We've been to many ramen place in AZ and this is definitley the top on my list. The ramen soup was extremely good. They also make good Karaage and fried rice. The owner seems to know about his ramen. The price was fair and I will be coming back often from now on. :)"}
{"text":"Finally, some authentic Ramen around the Phoenix area! Very nice and welcoming staff. The Tonkatsu was excellent. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"2.3 star I guess.   The broth lacked flavor, and paired with a little too undercooked noodles made for an uninspiring experience.  The single thinly sliced chashu pork was somehow fatty yet unsatisfying.   Soggy, mostly tasteless gyoza suggested a badly defrosted batch?    The soft boiled egg, I did appreciate, but it couldn't save the experience by its half self.   From the decor, the place tries pretty hard.  But for someone spoiled by the Southern California's ramen scene like me, this just isn't worth a second visit."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to explain how delicious this place is!!! The owner is super friendly and came over and explained the menu to us. The miso ramen here is the best I've ever had and the gyoza is phenomenal. I will be recommending this place to everyone. I am so happy to see a great ramen house here in AZ!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch on a Saturday evening. Great staff and customer service. We were a big group and they didn't hesitate to get tables together for us. We had just had a really bad experience across the street where they told us we couldn't eat there because we were a lot of people, and Hachi Ramen was very kind. Food was good, not the best I've tasted but overall it was good."}
{"text":"Let's talk about Hachi Ramen. The environment is open and welcoming with a \"welcome in\" spoken in Japanese when you come through the door. The waiter is friendly and consistent, the kitchen is open and the cooks are happy. They offer good prices for amazing food. Don't take my word for it though, go in and try it for yourself. Don't forget the sesame balls, they're great!!"}
{"text":"The ramen is really really good and so is the service! The owner/chef came out to check on the food and explained the entire process and inspiration that goes behind his recipes."}
{"text":"Waited 15 mins for a table because they said a table is opening up soon then tells me another customers took the table. Told me my family and I can sit on the bar then tells me there's no room by the time my whole family came in. Unprofessional and unorganized. Terrible experience that I had to leave a review."}
{"text":"Oh my! Oishi desu! Fantastic! This is a real deal authentic Tokyo style ramen shop - best ever in the U.S.!  First visit we tried the tonkotsu and miso ramen as well as the gyoza and takoyaki. In the photos the bowls look average size - even a little small - THEY'RE NOT ! They're BIG in size and huge in flavor and quality! The owner Bradley is incredibly friendly, kind and attentive. If you want real ramen, this is the place! (Bradley trained for two years in Japan to make one style dish - ramen - and they're the best they can be!  (Don't forget - slurping loudly is an expression of how much you enjoy your ramen!)"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite ramen place. I've never finished a bowl of ramen until I came here! The staff is super friendly and after only a few visits they recognized me and my usual order. Both the shoyu and tonkotsu are the best I've ever tried. The gyoza and chashu fried rice are really good as well! I love coming here and I highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the mood ramen (actually even if you're not in the mood too!)"}
{"text":"Service was good, the workers were friendly & nice. Place was clean & food didn't take too long to come out Miso ramen - 3 stars. Broth had very mild miso flavor, ramen was ok, soft boiled egg was a bit overcooked Tonkatsu ramen - 1 star. Everything in the dish was decent, the meat was actually good. However, the broth was inedible for me. The pork flavor/smell was sooo overpowering none of us could eat it Takoyaki - 3 stars. I love takoyaki in general.  The skin was slightly crispy, not much tako inside, seasoning was ok Chashu fried rice - 5 stars. Very flavorful. Everything comes together Gyoza - 4 stars. Decent. Skin could be crispier."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several ramen places in the valley and this is the absolute best! The thing that pushed over the top was the soft cooked egg. OMG it is flavored! So so wonderful! Also the owner is so appreciative and friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Officially, this is the best authentic ramen spot in Phoenix.  Over the last year or two \"authentic\" ramen spots have been popping up in Phoenix.  (And I don't mean sorry-excuse of ramen at likes of Republic and Umami). While they all got it mostly right with the noodles, soup stock and topping, but one the one that they all do poorly is the chasui pork.  Those places either grill or flame torch the pork to a rubbery texture, yuck.  The chasui at Hachi melted in my mouth and had excellent marinated/braised flavor, you can tell it was slow cooked for hours, no short cuts were taken.   The half boiled egg was cooked perfectly with great flavor while retaining the soft gooey yolk texture.  The Tonkatsu stock was not overpoweringly salty while still maintaining great flavors without needing to add \"extra flavoring\" for additional cost.  I officially declare Hachi ramen as the best authentic Japanese ramen in Phoenix at the time of writing."}
{"text":"I love their Ramen. First of all the broth is so different then other Ramen restaurant in Arizona, it is so tasty and creamy. I think that their Ramen is better then some Ramen in California. I am so glad we have real Ramen in Arizona. Also, their Chashu is unbelievable it is melted in your mouth. Hachi Ramen is real authentic Japanese Ramen. I can recommend it to anyone who wants real Japanese Ramen."}
{"text":"Awesome employees and amazing food for the price. Definitely recommending this place to my friends."}
{"text":"We were quoted a 30 minute wait and ended up waiting over an hour. Yes, they were busy, but there were open tables as well as dirty ones that just sat there begging to be cleaned. The seating arrangements also force you to share a table with others.  They keep their chopsticks in the center of the table with no wrapper on them. The other party seated at my table continued to play with the chopsticks we would have to use when the food came out. Super unsanitary.  Here's the worst part: I watched the kitchen pull out the pork they had been cooking and cut into it only to find out that it hadn't cooked all the way through. I kid you not, they pulled out a LIGHTER and tried to finish cooking the pork on the counter. I should have snapped a picture.  We also waited over an hour for our two ramen bowls. With the 5-6 cooks that were crammed in that small kitchen there's no reason that it should have taken that long to bring our food out.  So now we've been here nearly three hours between waiting to be seated and waiting for food. The food finally comes out and what do we find? IT'S ALL FREEZING COLD. Every single part of it - including the lighter-cooked pork.  Disappointing all around. I'd rather eat Top Ramen than come here ever again.  *In addition to the owner's comment: I understand how chopsticks work and how they were placed on the table. As I said, the other party at my table was playing with them - including the side you eat with. It's not sanitary.  I also know what I saw in your kitchen and how the pork was \"cooked\", as I was seated right next to it and paid attention. This is far from an \"accusation\", as you said, but thanks for addressing it. Your cooks were very obviously flustered when the pork came out under-cooked - a few other patrons had made comments about it as well - and they scrambled to finish 'cooking' it on the counter with a small, weak flame. Not something you'd see from a blow torch. You can explain this however you see fit, but I know what I, and others, saw.  Your turnover could have easily been handled. You created a Facebook event that over 2,000 people said they were interested in attending. Did you not think you'd end up with a mass crowd? By attending to your dirty and empty tables in a timely manner (not after 20+ minutes have passed since the last party left) the wait time for everyone would have drastically decreased. It's all simple planning.  I see you failed to address the freezing cold food that came out after such a long, dedicated wait. Does that not warrant an explanation? Why was it so cold? Because everything sat out in the open ready to be served, as your cooks focused on the under-cooked pork. As soon as they were satisfied with the pork they threw it into the prepped bowls and ran them out to the patrons. Yet, not surprisingly, the \"freshly cooked pork\" was as cold as the rest of it. Someone can get sick from that and it will be on your hands.  Anyway, perhaps invest in some heat lamps to prevent the food from chilling in the future?  Thanks for your response. I hope you will take heed of mine and others' feedback and adjust appropriately as your business grows. Best of luck to you."}
{"text":"The food is good and service by Dante was excellent. Thanks.   Place is in a corner to the left of Home Depot as viewed from the parking lot"}
{"text":"The ramen was the best I ever had.  The customer service was great.  Very glad we stopped in today"}
{"text":"Brand new ramen spot in Tempe tucked away in a shopping plaza you would never expect a ramen shop to be in. Crazy lines because it was the grand opening so it was well worth it. And word on the street was at 1pm they closed due to running out of noodles! They opened back at 6pm We waited maybe 45 minutes with others to get seats. Service was a bit slow but for a full house with lines out the door on opening night the guys at Hachi did their best to keep moving and get everyone their food and drinks. We got our food and it was the perfect temperature. The ramen was delicious just the right amount of flavors. We also tried the Chashu fried rice and the karaage. Awesome! Will be back for sure! I imagine there will be lines every day as this place is going to be a hot spot. Congratulations on your opening!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my coworkers for lunch. Excellent, authentic ramen selections! Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Fun fact: hachi means \"8\" in Japanese and is considered a lucky number.  Would this be my lucky day for ramen?  I was excited to try out this place since I saw the signs go up in this shopping center. We got here on a Friday night and were quoted a 30 minute wait but actually got seated in maybe 10-15 minutes. Seating is a bit limited as the shop itself is small.   The namesake \"hachi\" or 8 refers to the number of ingredients in a bowl of their ramen. There are currently 4 different types to choose from: Shoyu, tonkatsu, miso, and the hachi special which comes with more chashu pork and egg. Note that getting the miso ramen or combination is an extra dollar versus getting the shoyu or tonkatsu. After browsing through their menu I decided on the miso ramen karaage combination and tried some of the tonkatsu ramen. The combination includes a side of karaage chicken, rice bowl, and a small bowl of bean sprouts in addition to the ramen of your choice.   When I got my ramen I was disappointed that there weren't any slices of pork in it, despite paying an extra dollar. On the menu too it states that the ramen bowls come with your basic toppings: 1 piece chashu, 1/2 flavored egg, black mushroom (Or corn, bean sprouts), 1 piece dry seaweed, and green onion so I was expecting some kind of meat at least in the bowl. I thought at first a brown clump spotted on my ramen was maybe ground meat but it turned out to be miso paste. The flavor of the broth itself was very light, and the bowl had the thicker, yellow crinkled kind of noodles. Quite honestly I didn't really enjoy the flavor that much and the only thing I liked about the bowl was the lovely 1/2 egg which was marinated in soy sauce with a deep gold colored soft yolk. The tonkatsu ramen I tried did have the piece of chashu pork in it which was flavorful and tender, and it came with the thinner, straight, more pale noodles that look similar to what they serve at Tampopo Ramen.   The karaage chicken was lightly battered, very juicy and tender.   If I came here again I wouldn't get the miso ramen again due to the higher cost for value but maybe another variety of ramen from here will be better!"}
{"text":"Rode my bike from downtown Tempe to see what the hullabaloo was about. I opted for the Hachi special with corn and butter; the charsiu melts in your mouth (but wasn't too excessive) and the corn likes to hide from you. The egg was yummy! The prices for additional toppings is fair, I think. The menu uses Japanese terms but in English, which might confuse some people but that's okay. (In this case, you ask the waiter/waitress) Housewives and ASU students like to hang out here around lunchtime. South Tempe finally gets a dedicated ramen restaurant that ain't too shabby!"}
{"text":"Just opened 4 months ago. The owner and head chef spent 2 years in Japan exclusively learning how to perfect his broth. It shows.   Adorable little place with a flare of traditional decor. The music is Japanese and relaxing -- as it should be. No blaring top 40's here, kids!  Had the miso ramen with extra chashu, no egg. Boyfriend got the tonkotsu with extra chashu, no egg, with spicy sauce. I added a bit of the spicy sauce to my miso, it gave it the right amount of bite. Also, got their gyoza for an appetizer and finished up dinner with their promotional offer of sesame balls -- spent $30 get two sesame balls free!  I prefer the miso ramen to the tonkotsu because it is more flavorful and rich, but that's just preference as the tonkotsu is one of the best I've had. The spicy sauce is excellent and adds heat without masking the flavor of the broth -- as spice should be!!  If you're looking for the best ramen in Phoenix, you've found it. The wait is over."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  I was looking for a good Ramen place and I found this gem close to where I live.  I now have a favorite place To satisfy my Ramen cravings."}
{"text":"I am a ramen person, I love ramen and whenever I visit Japan, I eat tons of ramen. And I do believe this is the best ramen you can get in the state of Arizona.  If you don't mind to drive a bit to try some better one, visit Mitsuwa in Torrance, CA, you won't be disappointed.  If you don't mind to fly to Japan, go to Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum in Japan, it is a under ground ramen heaven place."}
{"text":"Legit AF. Forget all the other ramen places, just come here. Superb service and oh merrr god, the ramen was so umami."}
{"text":"The chashu and egg were super tasty with delicious broth. The best ramen we've had in Arizona!"}
{"text":"This is the first ramen place in Arizona I've actually enjoyed.  The dishes have had lots of flavor and I prefer the wavy noodle to the straight, so I'm really pleased they offer both and distinguish which is offered in each bowl.  We usually start by splitting an order of takoyaki and then delve into our ramen bowls.  Can't wait to make it in again, I've been daydreaming of ramen!  Mmmmmmm extra egg, extra chashu...."}
{"text":"Everything was made fresh (noodle, meat, egg, broth)! We have tried other ramen places in the area but Hachi is by far the best."}
{"text":"Close to office, nice location and food .  Supportive staff and great service  We tried egg noodles it was nice"}
{"text":"If you aren't looking you might miss this place.  Menu focuses on a few specialty ramen dishes.   My family likes this place.   Nothing fancy really just a good place for some quality noodles."}
{"text":"The miso was very good. So flavorful. The free sesame balls were delicious. I tried the fried chicken thing (forget the name) but personally did not like it. But I don't really like fatty chicken. A person in my group really liked them though. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The noodle is always fresh and nice.   Terrific food! We love it!  Definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We came with a large group and had many of their dishes.  They were all very good.  Each broth is unique and excellent.  I highly recommend his place"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite ramen place in Arizona at the moment. Their menu is very simple and isn't saturated with non ramen foods like sushi and poke. The chicken karaage here is also the best ive had since coming back from Japan. None of the other places ive been to really come close with their karaage"}
{"text":"I can already tell this will be my favorite ramen joint in AZ with its unpretentious atmosphere and ramen that is clearly made with pride, passion, and well balance of flavors.  Having just moved here from Calgary, AB, I have found a lack of ramen joints in comparison which is surprising for such a big US city but I'm lucky to have stumbled upon this place. The broths are made without MSG and is very flavourful and the noodles are on point. I loved how much the corn is portioned in my bowl.  We checked in and got a plate of sesame balls which is probably the best ones I've tried. They are smaller in size than I'm used to seeing but the perfect bite size with a not overly sweet filling. The dough is not too thick and has a nice crisp to it."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Phoenix, and I've tried a lot of them. Hachi is a hole in the wall next to Home Depot, and focuses exclusively on making good ramen. The sliced pork melts like butter in your mouth. The owner studied ramen making techniques in Japan before coming to Tempe. In Tempe, he tested the available ingredients to determine how to make ramen in the U.S. It starts with purifying the water as not to mask the flavor. For the rest, head over to Hachi and find out."}
{"text":"My family and friends visited Hachi Ramen and everybody loved it!!!   We loved Karaage(deep fried chicken). It has a very good flavor and was crisp outside.   The ramen here is the best in all of the Phoenix area! We ordered tonkotsu(pork based soup)ramen and shoyu ramen. The soup were so good, and the noodles were perfect al dente which you rarely get at other ramen restaurant in Phoenix. The meat(chashu) was super soft and tender, not to mention sooo delicious too.   This restaurant serves delicious ramen and other yummy Japanese side dishes that you should definitely try. The service was very quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The tonkotsu ramen is delicious! The broth has a strong, but not overpowering pork flavor, creamy and just....yum. The noodle texture was smooth with a perfect amount of stretch and balanced out the broth and other toppings wonderfully. The miso ramen was on point as well. The chef came out and talked to us, he trained in Japan for 2 years - legit! Everyone was so friendly. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Really good ramen.   The broth was meaty and flavorful (not too salty).  The takoyaki were solid (probably need to be a bit more gummy).  My kids said the karage were delicious.  The gyoza were marginal.  All kinds of delicious Japanese beverages.  Service was fun.  I liked the open space.  Very family friendly."}
{"text":"The BEST ramen in the Phoenix area! They take a lot of pride in their Ramen. They seem to really enjoy their craft. The meat wasn't charbroiled like other ramen places in the area. They cook the meat and let the egg marinate for at least overnight. Meat was falling apart, so good! Egg was perfectly jellied the way an Ajitama should be. I have tried both their miso and tonkotsu and while I'm not a fan of miso because other places I've tried are too dilute this place was full of flavor. Their tonkotsu was fatty and had such a good broth flavor. This is the ramen spot in Arizona."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the second time here was not any better than the first. There service was way faster and they had Miso available this time. So of course I had to try the elusive Miso. Not impressed, first you have to mix in the soybean paste yourself which made the soup grainy feeling. It didn't feel like it was cohesive with the broth. I asked about the meat and if any came with it, they told me it was mixed it with the paste. Side note I picked out something chunky and not paste from the paste and it turn out it was supposed to be the \"meat\". I tried what picked out which I had put on a napkin....edible? would not call it meat or \"meat\". The rest of the miso ramen was not  impressive and almost anything would have been better. My boyfriend had the chashu bowl and he was not impressed either, he said he only got through it, by drenching it with chili oil. I'm not trying to be harsh, but I feel I was let down a lot by this place-I had such high hopes."}
{"text":"Came to Hachi mainly because our usual ramen place across the street is closed on Sundays..  we were meeting my fiancé's sister and brother in law they wanted to try ramen so we brought them here.. the ramen was okay nothing bad about it but it wasn't that great either.. the staff was friendly and their menu is pretty basic.. we will probably just stick to our usual place.."}
{"text":"Outstanding Tonkatsu broth, perfect noodle doneness and sesame ball desert. Nice slice of delicious pork with hint of garlic with the ramen."}
{"text":"The food here was just ok.  The broth was amazing, but my noodles weren't done right.  Some were cooked perfectly but others were chewy.  Probably will not come back"}
{"text":"My husband and I drove 45 minutes for the grand opening just to find out they had a closed sign outside. The man inside told us they were not taking anymore people keep in mind this is at 1:00pm. I asked if they had takeout and their reply was no. I was excited to try this place but just by their accommodation service very disappointed."}
{"text":"Tha ramen is really awesome. It's soup is really good. This restaurant is the best I've ever eaten in Arizona. If you come here to eat will never regret it. It will definitely make you come back again."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Ramen! Owner and staff could not have been nicer and the flavors were outstanding. Please go! Definitely our new favorite neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Such a nice place I would go there everyday. Actually I did go there everyday. Their Hachi special is just too good to be true. Never had this kind delicious Ramen in AZ before. Fry rice and Takoyaki are also good."}
{"text":"Oh, my g-d!! The worlds best Ramen! The flavors are indescribably delicious. I have eaten each of the broth offerings, each of them are fabulous! Simple, yet very filling. The service is exceptional. Our server is very attentive and helpful. I doubt you could get better than this in Japan! Small place in a shopping center, you could easily miss it. DON'T!!!! You'd be missing out on a real treat. We drive 35 miles just to eat here. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Nice change for a lunch spot. Very friendly host making sure that you are informed of the lunch choices. The broth was really tasty and size was decent.  I had the Tonkatsu ramen and the pork was really flavorful. I noticed the egg was seasoned and had been marinated before serving. All in all I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! Small place but so good! The chef taught us about Ramen and what he learned from studying ramen in Japan! Really interesting! Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"The noodles were so fresh, & the broth that my soup was in was so amazing! The pork belly meat that was in the soup amazing!! That is one noodle joint that is a must eat again & again & AGAIN !! We had these octopus deep fried balls amazing if you love sea food it's a must try ! And now I'm learning how to use my chopsticks with noodles mmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is Awesome.!!  The service there was good, our server was very helpful and informative. The broths were DELICIOUS with their noodles and meat. Even the appetizers we great. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is a must go to!! Truly absolutely amazing. The flavors were out of this world. The pork belly was melt in your mouth good. First time in with my family today and we were beyond amazed! They helped explain the menu, gave recommendations and even accommodated for our toddler. The staff was incredibly welcoming as well. We will certainly be back often!! Highly recommend trying the Gyoza Combination with the Shoyu broth. Out of this world!"}
{"text":"Well at least they serve their ramen properly in a bowl that retains heat, the ramen was ok 3 stars for the miso ramen, the gyoza was refigerator cold on the inside but good news hot on the outside, by the way I was one of 2 people in there so if you can't get 1 out of 2 orders correct your basically doomed, will give the ramen another chance since the gyoza was a total buzzkill"}
{"text":"Best ramen in Phoenix! We've been looking for good ramen in Arizona for years. The chashu pork here at Hachi Ramen was even better than Santouka in Los Angeles! The egg was also notably delicious. I won't waste time saying negative things about the other fake ramen we've been compelled to endure at Republic and Umami, were just happy to have finally found good ramen here near our home and no longer have to wait for trips to L.A. or NYC to have a good bowl of ramen!"}
{"text":"This was my first ramen experience, well outside of top ramen,  but I'm sure that doesn't count. LOL! I read that the owner studied in Japan and I was impressed by this flavorful dish.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen. The broth was so rich and the egg was perfectly cooked. I was pleased with my ramen and will definitely be back.   I do wish they were open later on Sundays."}
{"text":"Very welcoming staff and helpful. My guy and I had the miso and the Hachi special with a couple of Sapporos and amazing takoyaki! We will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding ramen and great customer service. The owner is personable and genuinely cares about the tastes satisfaction of the customers. Also takes the time to explain to folks the difference among the different types of ramen if they don't already know!  Been here more times than I can count now."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to go for authentic ramen. My go-to dish is the Tonkotsu Ramen. It's simply fantastic! ( Extra noodles, extra green onion with a spoonful of spicy sauce make it even better!)  The owner is one of  the nicest people you'll ever meet. Him & his staff provides excellent service and will answer any questions you may have about the menu. I Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Seriously, amazing ramen. We discovered this place by accident and LOVE it. The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Fast service, cha shu was nice and tender. Good if you want a quick ramen stop. The karaage chicken was crispy and light. I wanted bean sprouts with it but got daikon instead."}
{"text":"Great food.   Love the Shoyu Ramen.  The Karaage and the Fried Rice are a must order.   Great Ramen Place if you love a Tonkotsu Base.  Otherwise, it might be too rich."}
{"text":"Great delicious ramen so far at the East Side. Has been here two weeks in a row.  Highly recommended to everyone. The ramen noodle broth is definitely what we expect. The karaage is cooked perfectly with great flavor and juicy. The kids love the Takoyaki.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I stumbled here after looking for a place to grab lunch for work. This was my first time ever having Ramen and it was so delicious. The staff explain all the flavors and took their time helping me with my decision. I got their miso ramen with pork belly and their goyza which was delicious. I was so impressed I came another day with my co-worker. I would recommend this place for sure and will be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place as it's new and close to our house. I read the reviews in advance and thought I'd give it a shot. We ordered two Ramon plates and they were out of several things including spicy sauce, pot stickers, and lemons. I get that they are new but something like lemons you should never be out of as there is a grocery store right down the street. The service was friendly and the food was OK. We might consider this place again in the future after they have all the issues worked out."}
{"text":"First time at Hachi Ramen as we have been on a ramen kick lately going to different places to experience everything the Valley has to offer. The Owner greeted us and was very attentive and gave a great explanation of what the menu offered. Very authentic flavor, ingredients,  and experience! We will be back again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the ramen noodles they had a nice texture to them. The broth was really flavorful  i will return to try other options i was on lunch from work and was rushing i will try them on my leisure time to enjoy it more"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a 5 star but as I was eating my Ramen, something poked me. The broth was definitely different from other Ramen places I've been to & the meat was very tendered with not too much fat. The egg had a sweetness but yet salty. Great job on the egg for sure. If they can get it to be more clean careful with rinsing their dishes or pot, it could have been a great place."}
{"text":"Best ramen around! Very authentic and broth is very rich. The staff is friendly! The place is a little smaller than I thought it would be."}
{"text":"\"Hell, when I was growing up, I could make a meal out of a package of Top Ramen and a bottle of Windex.\" ? Coolio  Hachi Ramen doesn't serve up Windex, sorry Collio, but they do offer ramen --- and it's pretty solid ramen at that!  We stopped in a few days after their grand opening and managed to grab a table without having to wait.  Our order was taken and a short wait later, the food came out.  As soon as they set our bowls of ramen and our takoyaki down, I was ecstatic.  I had ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen which came with thin straight noodles.   My noodles were cooked a bit on the longer side and wasn't the al dente consistency that I like but it still had enough texture to hold onto the broth.  The broth itself was pretty darn good!  It was thick, creamy, and sealed my lips together from the stickiness.  It looked like there was some fat swimming on top as well.  The ajitsuke egg was amazing.  It was boiled nicely and it actually has been simmered and marinated.  I also really enjoyed their fatty and tender cha shu.  Aw yis!  Their portions are definitely smaller but they're also cheaper too [almost $9 for their tonkotosu and miso ramen with the Hachi Special being $12].  As for the takoyaki, they were pretty good.  Although a bit on the smaller side, the gooey center made me rejoice.  I also got to try the broth from the Hachi Special which was lighter and more delicate than the tonkotsu.  I approve!  I definitely think Hachi Ramen is in my Top 3 favorite ramen joints in the valley.  Give this local business a try, guys!"}
{"text":"All the staff were very friendly and patient to explain the menus. I got a shoyu ramen and my friend got a spicy miso ramen. They were decent delicious! My friend really has a high standard for ramen after she had one in LA. This one satisfy our tastes. We also ordered the Karaage, it was good too. It was a good amount for me and my friend. Definitely highly recommend to thoae who want high quality ramen. The egg is ???, which is the sugared yoke egg which is awesome! The meat was good with a burnt end which added more flavor to it. The broth was rich and silkyjust really recommend for anyone who wants good ramen. It's also not that expensive for the quality. Shoyu and Tonkatsu is 8.75 for each. Recommend it to Poor college students on a pay day to celebrate"}
{"text":"Kids & I stumbled upon this Ramen House as were craving for some good ramen ! We love this place & glad we found a new ramen place to. We each ordered their different broths (Tonkatsu, Shoyu & Miso). They were all super good. Our server was super nice and very knowledgeable about our ramen. He suggested for us to try the 3 brotha & explained to us in detail what the differences between them. We also ordered their Tokayaki. Reminded me my time in Kyoto. Very tasty indeed! We highly recommend all their different ramen broths. We will come back again to bring the rest of the family!  Food was excellent & our server (Bradley) was excellent tonight. And of course, kudos to the chefs & his kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"It's pretty nice shop of ramen I Tempe. I came here for more than 3 times, and tried each of their ramen. Tonkotsu ramen is pork base and it smells pretty good. Shoyu ramen is chicken base, it's pretty similar that I went to Japan. I really love it and I tried everything they have.  By the way, miso ramen is the best one.  Chashu is the best one of their topping. If you want to try something new in Tempe, this store will be the best choice."}
{"text":"Amazing place! The waiter and owner were very attentive and nice. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and the noodles were great and the meat was excellent and perfectly cooked. They even ended up giving me a extra free bowl of ramen after I was done chatting with them. By far one of my favorite places and good priced."}
{"text":"Tonkatsu Hachi Special is slurp+++"}
{"text":"My only regret is that I wasn't more hungry cause I really wanted to finish al my food and try the dessert. When I remembered to take a picture I was already halfway done with the tonkotsu. Closest reminder of Tokyo and all the good food I had when I was there"}
