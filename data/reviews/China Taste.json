{"text":"Great place for reasonable take out.  Lovely family who own the business. We have been dining here for several years. Get the shrimp dishes. My wife loves the shrimp and Chinese vegetables. 

The north side gets a bad rap and the area around this place can be scary to out of towners.  Don't worry."}
{"text":"I give China Taste 5 stars! I order delivery at least once a week, and I have never had anything be wrong with my order in the 2 years I've lived at my house. The staff is friendly, the food is good and in great portions, and delivery is pretty fast. The menu is basic, and everything I have tried has been tasty. My go-to delivery spot... waiting on them to deliver my general tsos as I write this review :) word to the wise though, order it spicy or else it will just taste like sesame chicken. The hunan chicken is also fantastic!"}
{"text":"I think the food was really, really, really good for the price. The appetizer we got, boiled dumplings, were especially yummy. The General Tso's chicken wasn't the best I've ever had but certainly wasn't bad at all. The egg roll was really good too. My mom picked up the food and she said it was kind of divey inside but that doesn't really matter to me. The food was great and it was quick, and cheap."}
{"text":"I work on the North Side and went for a walk to find something new for lunch.  I am quickly growing tired of Eco Bistro directly downstairs from my office at Allegheny Center.

At any rate, came across this place at the corner of Ohio and the onramp to 279.  The lunch special was inexpensive and grabbed a soda for about $6 in all.  I had the Kung Pao Chicken and it was prepared to order.  Tasty, cheap, fast.  I ate inside - there are only a handful of tables in this place and it's decently clean."}
{"text":"Ok, lets start with the good. The beef with broccoli was mediocre, about the flavor one would expect for a fast food Chinese food restaurant.

Now the bad - everything else! First, the delivery was over an hour late. I called the restaurant about 25 min before the guy showed up, was offered no apologies just told the driver would be there in 15 min (was still 10 minutes past that). The driver showed up full of excuses and smelled horribly of cigarettes. 

So I paid and my wife and broke out the food. We ordered vegetable chow mein, beef with broccoli, 2 egg rolls, teriyaki chicken and steamed rice. 

The two main dishes we ordered, the beef with broccoli and the chow mein, came in what looked like good size containers and felt heavy. When we opened them we saw why - 85% white rice! I mean there was barely a helping each of the beef with broccoli. If I had known that I would have not ordered EXTRA rice.

The chow mein was NOT chow mein. It was steamed vegetables on top rice! I called to complain that we received the wrong thing, and the guy insisted that was what chow mein was! Unbelievable! He would be willing to replace it IF I drove to the restaurant, but that was not an option - which is why we ordered delivery in the first place. 

The teriyaki chicken - very dry, very bad tasting. It was on skewers, and tasted like it had been cooked at least 5 hours before our food came, and been sitting under a heat lamp losing what little moisture there was left. No teriyaki sauce.

Finally, the egg rolls (vegetable). Disgusting. All cabbage and tasted like it was boiled. The outside was definitely fried but the inside was so overcooked i could have eaten it with a spoon.

If I could have given this place zero stars I would. 22 dollars for the second to worst Chinese food I have eaten in my life. Do yourself, your stomach and your taste buds a favor and go somewhere else - anywhere else. I usually don't write reviews, good or bad, but this one merited the response."}
{"text":"If you want decent Chinese food, check this place out.  I'm a big fan of their spring rolls and won ton soup.  As for entrees, I've had really good luck with anything involving shrimp or roast pork.  Their prices are very reasonable and portion sizes are more than generous.  The place itself doesn't look like much on the outside but don't let that deter you.  The food is great and the service is fast."}
{"text":"This place is middle of the road for me. I used to order once a week but i feel the food quality has gone down a little bit lately. Its definitly not the same as it used to be. Hopefully i just had a couple of bad experiences becasue i used to love this place. 3 stars because it always comes fast"}
{"text":"The food is really good the service is also great! The eggroll was a little bit greasy for me but other than that everything is awesome!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a GOOD Chinese place. This is a GOOD Chinese place! The prices are awesome and the food is spectacular! The crab rangoon are under $5 and will leave you completely full! This place is great for satisfying that late night Chinese food craving!"}
{"text":"The place is freezing cold, like the same temperature inside as outside.  People working there were wearing a coat inside because I guess they just don't turn the heat on to lower their gas bill.

The glass on the front door is cracked.  The floor is dirty.  The \"open\" sign is being held up by packing tape.  The chairs are ripped.  Lots of shady people in neighborhood.

The eggroll and the General Tsos were fine, just your typical Chinese place food.  But something was off about the fried rice, the taste and the color were both just off a little.  Prices are low, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is always great and the best American-Chinese in Pittsburgh.    However, although there is a small seating area, it's best for take out.   The people that work there are very nice and it seems to be a family owned business.   Also, as customers can see into the kitchen, it is very clean.   Love this place."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  I requested no carrots and no celery in my dish.  The guy who took my phone order wanted to argue that it wasn't how I requested my order.  Then proceeded to tell me they would come pick up the bad order and then return with the correct order which leads me to believe they would've simply picked them out and done something possibly worse to my food.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Piping hot food and delicious.  Excellent price points.  This place greatly exceeds expectations."}
{"text":"This place has the best beef lo mien I have tasted in Pittsburgh.  They cook to order so your food is fresh and isn't sitting out under a heat lamp.  My friend says the hot and sour soup here is the best she's tasted as well.  I like their pork egg roll but it is pretty different from others.  It is mainly vegetable (Cabbage I believe) and pork.  Their egg drop soup is pretty decent.

I can't say I am impressed with their other dishes.  I've had curry chicken, shrimp fried rice, chicken soup, shrimp egg roll.  They were definitely edible just no where near as flavorful as the beef lo mien.  The chicken soup was horrible.  It was bland and the noodles were lo mien noodles.  Fried rice were ok but I've had much much better at other places.  They have a huge menu though so it'll take some time to go through them.

The obvious bad thing about this place is it is in a ghetto neighborhood.    It is probably not worth making a trip out there but if you're in the neighborhood, I'd say give it a try.  They're cheap and they give you tons of food.  It is cook to order so wait time might be a little long.  You can call in and order as well.  Not everything on the menu is the best but they have a huge menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Cheap Chinese Fast Food!  Woo hoo!

I'm a fan of sweet and sour chicken, but I've spent three years in Charlotte looking for a place that does the chicken, sauce, rice, and eggroll right. This place fits the bill.  The lunch special feeds 2 and is around $5!  The rice is not dried out or greasy...it tastes kinda like saffron rice (?).  It's yellow-ish and tastier than most fast food Chinese joints.

The young lady and gentlemen taking my orders are very friendly.  I forgot it was the 4th of July until she wished me a happy 4th!  Don't be put off by the fact its located next to the dingiest Food Lion in east Charlotte.  This place is cheap, fast, and tasty!"}
{"text":"They're really nice, especially when you're ordering on the phone. They aren't rushing you or rude at all! 
They let you know there is a delivery charge so on and so forth. 
My food will be here soon and I'll show pictures!"}
{"text":"I am taking away a star because they don't deliver. If China Taste delivered I could easily see myself eating from here weekly.  This is a hole in the wall in a seedy neighborhood but I just can't get enough.

The Chinese food is some of the best I've had.  Typically get the Hunan Shrimp or Schezwan shrimp with a side of pork fried rice. The shrimp are big and taste fresh not frozen . large and cooked perfectly and the veggies are always crisp and not soggy and over done. Also we've had the sweet and sour chicken and General Tso's chicken.  
Although the restaurant is tiny and a little run down the food is very good.
All the entrees I've ever had were served pipping hot. 

The restaurant is really nothing pretty and there are a total of 3 tables. The restaurant is tiny.  If you're passing through the Northside check this place out."}
{"text":"GREASY. My entrée was slimy, my rice taste it so be in my eggrolls were soaked as in filled in grease. Absolutely dripping with grease it was disgusting. And the restaurant is filthy - the health department needs to check that place out."}
{"text":"Huge crispy vegetable egg rolls  that's all I ordered veggie egg rolls are hard to find. Loved them new fav!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food for a cheap price. Just checked this place out tonight as I live nearby, def will be going back again. As noted in other comments, no delivery is a bummer."}
{"text":"I relied on the reviews of others when choosing this restaurant. And I must say I was not disappointed. Food was great, customer service was outstanding. Granted, my exchange was brief but I was not disappointed and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Needs to be cleaned up also need fresh paint job people in the kitchen need to be more friendly with better manners show that they're happy to have you as a customer"}
{"text":"Got take out from this place on the weekend.  Ordered kung pao chicken, steamed dumplings, and pork egg rolls.  I was really hungry so it hit the spot, but there wasn't that many chicken pieces in my kung pao chicken - a lot of peanuts (as expected) and a whole lot of celery and carrots (aka filler).  So I was a bit disappointed in that.  

The steam dumplings were good, especially when fresh and hot.  The egg roll was tasty as well - I didn't find it too oily.  Very affordable and a generous portion - I had the leftovers the next day."}
{"text":"Although I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food, I'll admit that China Taste is serving up some very yummy Chinese food on the North Side. Although the storefront is a bit drab, don't let that deter you from stopping in and picking up some food. On a recent rainy Saturday afternoon, my boyfriend and I made our way over to grab some food. We placed our order., paid and returned about 10 minutes later to pick up the grub.

I was in the mood for wonton soup and wasn't disappointed. Delicious, hot broth with a plentiful amount of wontons was promptly devoured. My boyfriend ordered two different beef and vegetable entrees, which were accompanied by white rice. I tasted some of his meal and agreed with him that it was very, very tasty.

China Taste was so good that we ended up stopping back later in the evening after we hit up the casino. I again ordered the wonton soup (although this time a whole quart). He ordered a quart of the chicken and broccoli. Again, super yummy.

Yep - the place is a whole in the wall, but the employees (the same were there both times) seemed pleasant. Plus, you cannot beat the price for what you get. It's redic cheap.

Stop in the next time you're in or near the North Side area."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken and broccoli with extra chicken. 
 Received a meal of 3/4 rice the rest chicken and broccoli. Wife ordered this and ate this. 
 Called them up and their attitude was horrible. 
This was a delivery order. 
 Nasty food,nasty portions and nasty taste. 
 I know I should have stuck with Best Wok the best around but they don't deliver. 
 I sincerely hope this place does not solicit again in our neighbor hood or we will have them kicked out. 
 Found menu on all our doors. 
 The guy was actually walking they the streets with a flashlight which is kind of dangerous anywhere."}
{"text":"This is what I look for in a take-out place.  Good food, large portions, fair prices.  As already stated, they don't deliver.  Service was fast though, and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's not uncommon to find a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall (at least, not in Charlotte), but it is reasonably uncommon to find a decent Chinese restaurant in a strip mall.  This particular restaurant has been in this location next to the Food Lion for quite a while, for good reason - it typically has a solid flow of traffic moving in and out through the doors.

The menu selection isn't anything different from any other menu that you'll find at any other Chinese restaurant, but one notable difference about this place is that if you call them you can actually understand them.  This isn't a slight on Chinese people, but sometimes it seems that if you try and place an order it's like using a really bad drive-through speaker.  Not here.  That alone is worth at least one star.

When it comes to the food, it's prepared quick and with fresh and tasty ingredients, at a decent price.  While there is a small selection of combinations, most of the selection is made up of plates where you can order either a small or large size.  Beware - the large size is big.  Two people can eat off of it and have some left!"}
{"text":"So we've been here a couple times and have to admit their food is really good. So far we have tried their white rice, fried rice, lo mein, chicken wings( my husband's favorite), orange chicken(my personal favortie) and pepper steak.
 
You can tell the difference between their white rice and fried rice I'm not sure if it's 2 complete different types or it's just the way it's cooked. I like the fact that their fried rice DOESN'T have veggies (* for you veggie lovers: I'm not sure if you have to ask to add them or if there's and extra charge for it). 

Lo mein has thick noodles and include a variety of different veggies and meats. We ordered the house special which had a good amount of all 3 (chicken, shrimp & roast pork). They offer just veggies, pork, chicken, beef, and shrimp. The house special (chicken, shrimp & roast pork) $8.50 for qt. 

Their orange chicken is packed with flavor and they even add orange peel slices so you know they add actual orange flavor, it came with white rice $9.35

Their pepper steak is also really good which included onions and green peppers. The veggies that they used were real fresh and tasty, also severed with white rice $5.85 pt size.

How could I forget about their veggie egg rolls. They are absolutely delicious. $1.35 for each 

If it's your 1st time I recommend going in and asking portion size. The 1st time we ordered over the phone and when we got our food it was way too much so the next visit we went it to actually see what was included etc. They also offer delivery with orders over $12.00 and must be local."}
{"text":"The Vegetable lo mein and the dumplings are delicious and this place is a quick and easy pick up for anyone who's hankering for some good Chinese food to-go on the Northside! Orders are ready usually within 10-15 minutes and service is quick and efficient with some delicious dishes for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy China Taste, and if they delivered I'd give them 5 stars. They're quick, and a perfect spot for when you're craving American Chinese food. It's nothing fancy, and I wouldn't eat in store but it makes for a great take-out place."}
{"text":"Followed the advice of my fellow yelpers, gave this place a shot, and I was not disappointed. My fiancé and I moved to the area a little less then two years ago and up until now, we have been unsuccessful in finding our neighborhood go-to spot when it comes to Chinese. This is it! It's inexpensive and tasty. Its not overly salty like some Chinese take out tends to be."}
