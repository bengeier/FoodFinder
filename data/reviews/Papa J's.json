{"text":"I've been to Papa J's twice and had mixed experiences.  Both times I had the banana pepper appetizer, which is great and goes really well with the FRESH and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.  For entrees, me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience.  I've had the fish sandwich (very good) and the eggplant parm sandwich (okay).  My girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it, but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing.   The service is also a mixed bag.  The first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even MADE me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich.  The second time, the server was lackluster, didn't know anything about the menu and wasn't able to take proper care of us.    I would return to Papa J's, but I my terrible experience last time isn't enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around Carnegie/Robinson."}
{"text":"We visited on 11/15 with a party of 15.  While I know a party of 15 can be overwhelming, we did call in advance for reservations. Thus, allowing proper staffing. We arrived early and headed to the bar. The bartender there greeted us quickly and took great care of us. When it was time for our reservation we were seated immediately. That is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst. We sat for 20 minutes before a server came to our table. At that point, she said I'll grab you water and bread.  Another 10 minutes go by and members of our party went to the bar to grab drinks as the server vanished (still no water or bread). She finally comes back to the table with bread (no waters) and takes our drink orders (about 40 mins into sitting at the table). Next thing we know, a nice gentleman by the name of Patrick is our NEW server. He really stepped up the service and should be commended. However, we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold. We also ordered the \"incredible white pizza\" which was incredibly cold. While Patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible. Not once did the front of house manager come check on us.  This is the second time I've visited and the 2nd time I've been disappointed. Also, I wrote to the restaurant and received no response."}
{"text":"san francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great. I am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area. I liked Carnegie because u can stroll down Main street and hit a couple places for lunch. I imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night. we ate a lunchtime and it was nice."}
{"text":"So dissapointed been here 2 hrs,worst service ever Waited 30 mins for our drink order,then placed order waited for food ,when it came cold but flavorful. Other than one meal that veal was flipped over so you couldn't see it was burnt. Manager came over,but was very unconserned,seemed put off. All the waiter had to do was explain the situation. Nice atmosphere,just need to make customers want to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  Some of the best Italian food you can get for the price."}
{"text":"530 on a friday night the place was pretty empty. 3 tables including ours in the big room we were seated. Our waitress was not friendly bordering on rude and impatient. Our drinks arrived quickly with some boring bread and sauce.   We placed our oders chicken parm for me, no salad for extra $ as waitress said only 2 types of dressing available Italian or vinagrette.  Gnocchi for my husband ($4 extra charge for ordering gnocchi!) And standard kids meals for our 2 kiddos. The food arrived and best i can say is Eh. For that much money a jar of ragu and frozen gnocchi would have been just as good. Nothing yummy or special about the chicken parm. Oh and our waitress tossed the dishes down in front of us. No talk, no banter nothing at all. Weird. Our 2nd experience here and we're done. Not going back. As we walked out my 12 year old said we could have done better at pasta too. Yep! A wasted $65!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \"yep\" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \"What do you want me to do\"?  My friend said \"An apology would be a good start\" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \"Get out and don't come back\" ???????? Are you kidding????  My friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred.   That being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.  There are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Had the Eggplant Parmesan and it was very good. Bradley was our server and he was on top of things all the time. Prices are reasonable and the decor is inviting. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The meat on the antipasto salad consisted of two pieces of pizza type pepperoni. That was it. We told the waiter and he said they had a new cook. He came back with a couple pieces of deli ham rolled together and cut into four pieces. This is our third try and we reeeeeally wanted to like this place, but it's three strikes and we're out."}
{"text":"My husband and I dinned at Papa J's last evening with another couple.  We came equipped with up to $ 14.00 off coupon we had planned to use, and they planned on using their Entertainment Book coupon.  We were told, rather harshly and rudely that we could only use one coupon per table...hard and fast rule of the establishment.  But we protested, there are 2 couples here, paying on separate checks, so can't understand this rule.  Said they would take up to 3 Entertainment Book coupons per table, but not the one that drew us in from online Clipper Magazine.  What difference does it make which coupon you use???? If you allow one, why not the other!  Not building a \"come back\" attitude for us customers, and we don't intend to go back.  Some food was really good, while other meals were just ok, esp. in portion size.  All menu items are ala carte, so pretty pricey, so coupon discount would have been nice.  Waiter we had, though he said he had been there for 21yrs, was pretty abrasive and a little neglectful with his service."}
{"text":"Terrible service...terrible food...this place smells like rotten wet wood"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Papa J's with a group of 6.  I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.  People ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.  We ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.  Hard to tell if the deserts were \"homemade.\"  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one.   On the whole, I was on the fence with my overall impression of Papa J's.  \"A-ok\" probably is the best way to describe it."}
{"text":"Oh, my.  Rarely have I been so disappointed in a restaurant and seen a restaurant fail miserably in so many aspects.  First of all, we made a reservation, and when we entered the restaurant, we had to wait at least 10 minutes before someone acknowledged our presence and asked us if we were waiting to be seated.  The person that asked us and eventually led us to a table was, in fact, the manager, although we didn't know it at the time - and nothing in his demeanor toward us suggested he cared about providing us with good customer service.  He seemed like just another overworked employee.  Second, while we were waiting to be seated (and being made to feel as if our presence was causing them an inconvenience while they searched for a table for us), servers and other staff zipped by us, no smiles on faces, no greeting to us or the customers who came in after us, no witty banter with one another - just a general sense of being overworked and frazzled - even though as far as we could tell, the restaurant was less than HALF FULL - there were empty tables all over.  Speaking of empty tables...there were a lot of them when we were seated, and none of them had been cleared and reset.  We were at this restaurant for close to two hours, and in that time, one person came and cleared 2 tables and did not finish resetting them.  Dirty dishes, food, discarded napkins, and more lay around the tables for the duration of our meal.  Additionally - payments were left on tables, receipt books uncollected until about an hour into our dinner when a few of them were picked up in a rush by a server.  Once we were seated, no one could tell us who our waiter was, although we were in a room with only two other tables being served and it was clear that server should've been our waiter.  He never acknowledged us, yet as the evening wore on, it seemed he got very vocal and boisterous with the tables he WAS serving in some sort of strange passive-aggressive way of showing us what we were missing by not having his service.  Instead, another server who appeared overworked and who had no customers in our dining area was told by her manager to serve us.    Our entrees took over an hour to be ready, between when the salads we ordered came out and when our dinner appeared.  At that point we didn't even care - we just wanted to leave.  After our meal, we asked to speak to the manager.  The person who seated us (we had no idea he was a manager) came to our table and waited for us to speak to him before he spoke to us.  We had to ask him TWICE what his name was and then he answered and asked us in a somewhat accusatory tone why we asked to see him.  We told him everything we listed here - how we had to wait to be acknowledged, how no one (not even the manager) seemed to know who our server was, how the tables took over an hour to be cleared, how long our food took to be prepared, and how disappointed we were in the overall service.  We politely asked for some hospitality to compensate for what became a very stressful evening.  He was not very apologetic, blamed the service on some vague disarray in his staff that night, and asked if a 20% comped bill would be satisfactory.  We asked for and eventually received 50% comped.  Still, there was barely an apology or an acknowledgement of an evening wasted.  My husband and I were visiting my parents for the holidays and wanted a nice evening out to dinner.  We were all blown away by the lack of professionalism and service at this restaurant, we will never go back again, and I would warn others that if management continues this way, they will have a similar experience.    If it even matters at this point, the food was just so-so - but as I said, after that experience in customer service, we hardly cared if the food was stellar or terrible - we just wanted to get out of there."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend. My friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage. The waitress was extremely rude. He never did get the correct meal. When We talked to the manager, his answer  was .,\"well what do you want me to do fire the waitress?\" Too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude!"}
{"text":"My family and I wanted to go out for a nice dinner and chose Papa J's after reading good reviews on Yelp. This is one of the few instances where Yelp reviews were not equal with my experience.  When you walk into the restaurant, the setup is quite nice. The smell of cooking and of the fresh bread is very inviting. There's also a display case with an assortment of cakes that looks very nice. The host was very cordial. But after the initial welcome, everything gradually declined.  Our waiter was quite smarmy. At first he seemed to be cordial, and then this attitude like he was better than us and doing us a favor by waiting on us came out. It was quite subtle in the tone of his voice. I thought I might have been too sensitive to this, but my husband later said the same thing. I won't go into details, but service was below average.   The bread here is good. I got a individual-sized pizza that was quite good. My husband's pasta dish was all right, but at $18 a la carte, I thought it was overpriced.  The absolute most disappointing part of my experience was the dessert. I don't order dessert often; so when I do, I expect an indulgence. The cakes looked so good in the display! We ordered a 5-layered chocolate cake and tiramisu. The tiramisu came in a goblet and it was the strangest presentation of tiramisu I've ever seen. It was like a blob piled in the goblet.   When I saw the chocolate cake, I IMMEDIATELY knew that the cake was not made there (and yes, the host later confirmed this). How did I know this? Next to the cake was a line of whipped cream from a can. It looked and tasted like Reddi-Whip! No pastry chef would use canned whipped cream. It's fine if the restaurant doesn't have a pastry chef and purchases their cakes, but really, canned whipped cream? It doesn't take long to make it fresh. I'm not a whipped cream snob, BUT I certainly would expect it from a restaurant with these airs. The clincher was that the cake was not fresh. The one side was stale! I'm sure the bakery that made the cake would be equally disappointed to know their creations were being served sub-par.  My advice: go somewhere else for dessert.   Papa J's has a nice atmosphere (what's with the flags though?), but it misses the mark on the food. It's just okay. I think it's overpriced by maybe $5 and I honestly think Olive Garden has better tasting food and desserts.  If it was appropriately priced for the taste of the food, I would have given Papa J's 4 stars. Since it wasn't, 3 stars. The service and the dessert took it down to 2."}
{"text":"Yummy Yum, Let me get me some.  This place rocks!!! Went here with the wife and had a great dinner.  Portions are very generous and the food is delicious.  Be prepared to pay top dollar though for the entrees, but they are worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Absolutely atrocious. Husband and I went in for dinner. Never been treated so poorly before. Starting when we walked in and were almost yelled at by the host (Ed- who it turns out is also one of the managers). Went to the bar and the guy behind the bar was rude and dismissive with us. He seemed to be more interested in conversing with his friends.   When we were finally sat, my chicken was cold and my husbands veal was atrocious. Our sever was an older guy who seemed very flustered and kind of clueless.  Don't waste your time- go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant on Earth. I live in West Virginia and will gladly take the hour drive any day of the week to eat here. Their selection is huge and the food tastes so fresh and has amazing flavors. The best part of the restaurant though is the bread they give you at the beginning of your meal...so delicious!  The service is also very good. The first time I went our waiter went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of, and we were only a party of three. The second time I went with a party of 9 and the service was not that great considering we were giving them so much business. If you're planning to have a large party, call ahead of time.   i recommend the cheese ravioli with the divine cream sauce, its a personal favorite"}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but felt compelled in this case since my meal was so disappointing. I had the Marsala chicken as my entrée. The sauce should have been reduced for several more minutes - it was watery and tasted strongly of alcohol. The vegetables looked like they were just boiled.   The meatballs in the wedding soup were cold. We ordered the tiramisu which was fine but the portion was really small for $6. You could basically eat it in 3 bites.  Service was below average. We were served the entree just a few minutes after we got the soup and appetizer, when it was obvious we had barely started eating those. We also got fried garlic bread when we ordered baked (not a big deal normally but this just combined with everything else...).   Definitely not planning on going back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but they must search far and wide to find the most miserable servers. I am going to stop coming here because the servers always make me feel like I'm bothering them. It's not just one either...almost all the servers except one older gentleman who is actually nice. If you eat here, hope you get him."}
{"text":"Superb service and food. Parking can be a little tough and this place is a bit pricey. If you can get in and are okay paying a little more you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love everything about this restaurant.  There is never a wait, the staff is very professional.  It's not loud so it's nice that you can carry on a conversation with your companion(s).  The bread is great!  We love their greens and beans, and Antipasto appetizers. Both are big enough to share with 3 to 4 people.  The chicken Parmesan is huge and delicious.  I also love the feta, spinach and tomato pasta. We always finish up with the tiramisu. The food is fresh and so good and is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is a regular go-to for me. I love the food and the service. They always have the wine that I like and the food is always delicious. I suggest trying the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store (in the section where you can buy stuff to take home). It is sublime and makes you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness."}
{"text":"The service was terrible.  We had to get up 3 times to get our own plates, bread, and the check.  The waiter obviously didn't care about serving us."}
{"text":"We continue to return whether it be for happy hour drinks or celebratory dinners; it is a staple for us, living in Green Tree. I constantly find myself craving their lobster ravioli, which is cooked to perfection and just the right amount of cream to the sauce. I have yet to experience a bad meal, poor service or unprofessional bar tending. Every meal, server and bartender has exceeded any expectation and I will continue to recommend this place. Enjoy a bottle of wine and olive plate with a friend or take your pick of a homemade tasting pasta and sauce - you will not be disappointed! Don't enjoy it? Don't return, more room and time for the rest of us!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday evening, menu had a good selection of all the main staples. Good wine and beer selection and the prices aren't over the top. Food was delicious and the wait staff was attentive. Nothing here NOT to like. They do what they do particularly well."}
{"text":"I gave them 4 stars for two reasons - 1) they do not have fresh pasta and 2) my boyfriend's chicken Abruzzo was dry. The service was attentive and the bread was amazing. My Carbonara was incredible! The main dining room was a nice grotto style reminiscent of Rome; nice for couples and girlfriends catching up on life. I loved the Montpluciano in a carafe, but don't miss the extensive Italian wine list. We will definitely return to this Carnegie gem!"}
{"text":"I promise, readers....I'm not trying to be picky here. Sit down in the restaurant and have a meal. It's decent, depending on the chef. Service may be on the slower end but I really could care less about the service as I am understanding that there are a lot of factors that play into that. However, order out....In fact, whatever you go with, include a salad and see what you get. It is nothing shy of pathetic. A few shavings (count them) of Parmesan and a fistful of whatever menu item lettuce you go with. Their take out is so bad. I haven't learned my lesson because I have repeatedly ordered their takeout in hopes that it has been a quality fluke all along. I just had the cod sandwich. Yes, I ordered the take out again tonight but this cod sandwich is why I am finally here, right now. This cod sandwich was on a flatbread that, I believe, they made...The Flatbread wasn't too bad--Dense like the kind of carb you know is going to sit like a brick in your stomach. As far as the actual \"sandwich\" is concerned. Picture a piece of breaded cod with ONE piece of leaf lettuce and ONE tomato slice that is cut as if someone had started cutting it and then looked away to talk to someone while continuing to cut to produce a super thick tomato slice -- Bit of a stretch here and there's my picky side. COME ON...No sauce? No Special Cheese that would pair well with the bread and fish?! It was 13 dollars?!   ...That is my real issue here. This place is way too pricey for the quality of food you get, especially, when you choose to order take out. Typically, I go with the Chicken Romano, but even THAT leaves you to ask yourself, \"How is this 15 dollars?\". Yes, they give you 3 pieces of chicken and a cut-ling of broccoli but instead of this single menu choice, give me a choice of ONE piece of chicken that is of quality and interesting! Pair it with some damn pasta! Might I add that this 15 dollar Pollo dish (or any of the dishes) DOESN'T include pasta. Nope. Pasta comes as a separate order. I want to say that this may be traditional of Italian restaurants but if that's true....I hate it. I believe their menu is set to be family size portions but why JUST that? Papa J's... Please fix your take out service. Please make the meals of equal quality as if you were sitting down in the restaurant. Add some zing to your dishes, especially, since the food industry in Pittsburgh is vastly changing. Change can be good. Give it a shot?   O ya, There is sometimes a woman who picks up the phone for the takeout order and she is rude as hell. Probably because I tell her to please have whoever makes the salads to put a little more effort into the salad I am ordering. \"This time, give me 5 shavings of Parmesan, damnit!\" For those of you who cared enough to keep reading this review....Ha, Thank you. Take heed  P.s. You can never go wrong with their desert choices, though.   CHEERS"}
{"text":"We recently decided to celebrate our anniversary at Papa J's. There is a parking lot in the back of the building and the entrance is on the side. The food was perfectly prepared, served at the proper temperature, and was quite delicious. Portion sizes were quite satisfying. The complimentary bread and oil was excellent. The service was polite and efficient."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry for the loss of Papa J's. I hope that the owners can rebuild. Carnegie has lost a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Biased service. Single woman never offered chair at bar, stood for 30 minutes 2 other women come in and are offered stools. Never offered menu, same two women offered menu. Never felt this way before, but I felt like walking out on my check.  WOW!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after I got lost due to construction in the area. Was trying to go to a different place. Glad the Pizza Gods were looking out for me. Ordered a caesar salad with anchovies and a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms. The salad was fresh and excellent. Dressing was made fresh and the anchovies were top notch. There is a wide variety of anchovies when it comes to quality and they use excellent ones. There was also plenty of them as usually you get a sparse amount. The large salad was more that enough for my wife and I. They serve a bread basket with two styles of bread. Pepper cheese and a standard Italian with a harder crust. They were both so good I purchased a loaf of each on the way out. Price per loaf was only $4. No way they make profit on the Pepper Cheese Loaf. Best value in bread in quite some time. I will stop in for the bread whenever I am in the area. The Pepper Cheese I would rate a 9.5 out of 10. The Italian was as good as it gets. I am a Pizza snob and getting a good review from me is tough. I am so tough I do not review if I think its bad. There Pizza is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone remotely close to the place. I would ask for a little less sauce. I would call it almost NY Style. Slightly thicker crust. I asked the waiter if I should order it well done and he said order it as is. He was correct and it came out perfect.   The waiter and staff were excellent and they informed me that they do not even own a microwave."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, Papa J's was a great place to eat. Great food and knowledgeable wait staff. Unfortunately, after a couple of very unsatisfactory meals we will not be going back.  Looking for a great Italian meal? Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is probably the worse excuse for an Italian restaurant ever.  Their sauce is horrific!  Looks like they opened up a can of diced tomatoes and put it on pasta.  When making Italian sauce you need to use EVOO and other spices and cook it for a few hours.  I don't know how they stay in business.  Also they should look in the dictionary and look up \"al dente\"."}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to Italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food, and couldn't think of any place we wanted to eat. Papa J's measures up to our expectations with great salads, bead and wine. I'm partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers, ravioli, fish, white pizza. I like the space with exposed brick walls-there are knowledgeable servers. Sometimes it is a bit loud- more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby. But don't get the wrong impression -it's a great place-consistantly great food."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Everything I've ever had here was great!  The white pizza is a MUST!  Always amazing!  I'm also a big fan of the chicken piccatta.  The bread that they bring to the table is delicious too!  They have a wide variety of selections on the menu and they also have nightly specials that always sound great!  Their prices are also reasonable.  Overall, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This Italian-American restaurant has a long and proud history in the Pittsburgh area and is one of the first tenants to help revitalize Carnegie's downtown area. It is absolutely HUGE inside, although you cannot see that from outside. The provide a nice parking lot behind the restaurant that does not charge for parking, but there are also several city-lots within short distances away in case that lot is full.  When you enter the restaurant, you might be a bit bewildered. Right in front of you is a large counter that is used by the servers and is normally stocked full of loaves of bread. To your left is a deli counter with cakes. Many of them appear to be 10 or 12 inches tall! This, by the way, is a hint of how gargantuan the portions served here are! If you go off to the right, around the server counter, you will find the host/hostess table.  There are actually four dining rooms in the place. Two of them are to the right of the host stand and they are finished in pale wood tones, well lit, and with a variety of tables to seat four to ten people. If the host takes you further into the restaurant, you will pass the bar area and then enter a pair of even larger rooms that are separated by an indoor water fountain. The decor here is older and darker, but still light enough to view the menu and food.  The menu is printed on two pages of an oversized sheet of paper. One one side are all the normal pasta, chicken, veal, fish, pork, salads, and meat dishes that one would expect. There are also lots of traditional appetizers. On the other side of the menu you find the beer, wing, and drinks menu. If you are in the wine mood, they have a large selection of bottles for $35 and some specialty wines that start there and go up to about $100. There are also many offered by the glass.  In our case, we were captivated by one of the specials of the day which was a kale and spinach stuffed ravioli. One of us chose to get the dish with the Divine Sauce while another chose the same dish but with the Basil Pesto Cream Sauce. When the food arrived, we all agreed that this dish was excellent. Lots of flavor and the ravioli melded well with either sauce. Oh, by the way, they grill a chicken breast, slice it up, and offer it on top of the dish as well!  The other two members of our party chose to go with the Chicken Marsala and the Baked Salmon. Both of those comes with that day's vegetable - which happened to be Broccoli during our visit. Again, both dishes were very flavorful. The Broccoli was steam but had no special flavorings added to it, so it was a bit bland.  While we got a bread plate as soon as we sat down, we also ordered two appetizers. One of advertised as Portabella caps - but it ended up coming with large chunks of sausage as well as a sauce. The other was the Scallops. Each of those appetizers could have satisfied all four of us, or been used as an entree! they are that large.  Between all the food that we got, the wine we had, and the dessert that we skipped, the bill came to around $50 per person. Service was excellent and we noted the waiter hanging around, just out of hearing range, monitoring whether it was time for him to make an appearance. Perhaps this was due to the relative lack of customers, but it did make the meal's pacing go very well."}
{"text":"We were a party of 18 and every aspect of our meals was disappointing. My $7 salad consisted of lettuce with dressing, the calamari tasted like it was freezer burned, the shrimp in my pasta tasted like it was straight from the Mon, and others at the table had similar experiences with their meals. Then to top it off they wouldn't spit the check between couples even though they asked who the couples were when they took our orders. This was my first and definitely last visit."}
{"text":"Ok a few things. First we walked in and asked for a table and was told it would be 5 mins. So after 10 mins, we were seated and there was 10 tables that were open! Why the hell was there a wait??? The older man that took us to the table could have done nicer. The bread was great and that was about it. The food was not bad but it was not good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to go for dinner! The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable, and I haven't had anything that wasn't delicious and the portions are legit. They also have decent happy hour specials and their bar area has a cool vibe. They have outdoor seating too which is a plus in my book! My husband and I love it so much we had our rehearsal dinner here! They have great spaces for private events!"}
{"text":"It was just what we were looking for. The service was great. My husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. It was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. I had the stuffed eggplant. That was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. I would definitely go back. Really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back."}
{"text":"Thanks yelpers for this find. The service, the plating, the ambiance were wonderful. I had the eggplant parmigiana and it was good - but different. It was thinly sliced (like deli meat) and wasn't breaded, it was fried in a very light batter."}
{"text":"I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.  My pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.  Well, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville.   The first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal.   Can I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.  I know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh!  Reasonable prices & delicious food.  Only one weird quirk - they don't bring the delicious fresh bread until you order - but it is complementary (sometimes they will if you ask nicely, but it doesn't come automatically).   Everything is super fresh - my friends & I always order a salad or two as a starter (they are huge & don't offer side portions) - I strongly recommend the panzanella salad.    Then, any of the pastas. Seriously, they are all good!    If you remember to save room for dessert - the cakes are all GIANT!  Definitely enough to share (probably with a large table)."}
{"text":"Papa J's is one of those places that has been around for ages, and this admittedly shows in the set-up and presentation of the place. The decor feels like an \"old school\" Italian restaurant's decor, and the menus are the huge, lengthy ones that I remember seeing in Italian restaurants as a kid. The portions here are also very reminiscent of the Italian fare I remember from the '90s, in that they're huuuuuuge. But, old-school is admittedly something that Pittsburgh loves, which is further reflected in the popularity of Papa J's. Reservations are a good thing to have if you plan on dining here.  I've only been here once, and I felt bad for my waitress during that visit, as she was waiting tables AND sometimes helping behind the bar that night. I know a friend who's done this before so my heart went out to her; and if nothing else, the extra time between her visits to our table gave my family and I more time to talk. But given those long wait times, I got the feeling the place could have used an extra hand on deck that night.   As for the food...I ordered gnocchi, and my dining buddy the chicken piccata. The chicken piccata was actually very good - tender, and well-flavored, with fresh vegetables accenting it all. And I enjoyed the gnocchi overall; you can customize your gnocchi order, so I asked for spinach and feta on mine. The gnocchi itself was good, but I don't think I'll be getting that topping combination again; the bottom of my bowl featured a layer of excess oil, and it did not mix into my dish and with the toppings for the best flavor. The dish seemed a tad saltier than necessary as well. Not terrible, perfectly edible, but admittedly not the best gnocchi I've ever eaten.  \"A-ok\" is a good summary of my visit here; honestly, I'd give the place 3.5 stars if I could. I liked the food for the most part - the drinks were quite delightful (I had a tasty gin and tonic to start my night here off) - and my waitress was clearly doing her best on a busy night. There were enough good things here that I would definitely come back to enjoy another meal - or maybe just an appetizer and one of the giant desserts on display by the entrance! Because those looked gooooooooooood..."}
{"text":"My first time at Papa J's and it was nice for a little spot in Carnegie.  The service was good, food prices were reasonable and the quality was decent. Parking is conveniently located directly  behind the restaurant. Walking in the place, not only are you greeted by the hostess but the cooks said hello and made us feel welcomed.   We were a large party and sat in their main dining room. The table was in the middle of the room and massive---perfect spot for a nice get together.  It's a cozy little place with linens and a bit of class...nice. Our table ordered everything  from carbonara to lamb chops to crab cakes. There was fresh balsamic and oil or butter for the bread...you know the drill. Their alfredo sauce had a different consistency between 2 orders and I'm  not sure why. One was runny and the other the perfect consistency at the same temp. The lamb chops seemed to steal the show and the table raved about them.   It was a nice first visit to this place. I don't think I would go out of my way to dine here though. There wasn't a wow factor to lure me from the city out this way for GP."}
{"text":"Extremely expensive for what you get!!!!charged extra for extra salad dressing! Plus there were six of us there and we ordered a bottle of wine to start off and the first thing out of the waitress mouth was you only get five glasses out of a bottle?!?!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around."}
{"text":"It's been here forever and for good reason: consistent very good Italian food, good servers and kitchen management. The parking is a pain in the butt, but if you go outside of the normal rush for dinner you'll be okay. It's worth it."}
{"text":"The last visit I overlooked the $25 gnocchi special. The reason it bothered me was they tell you the specials but not the prices. Okay, shame on us for not asking. My daughter wanted to try here again for her birthday. So I've decided I'd go against my not go there anymore and appease her.  We've been here 30 minutes and just got our water. Our appetizer has yet to come out. The bread is apparently just as scarce. Hey but we have a full cup of fresh parm cheese.  I ordered the chicken marsala and I was informed there's an up charge for pasta with my meal. Really? Potatoes or pasta are always included with marsala.  Hooray the appetizer finally comes out and half ass warm and horribly bland.  We asked for a manager and the waitress overheard us and asked us is there an issue. Ma'am please just leave us alone as we will speak to the manager. 5 minutes and crickets, yep you guessed it, no manager to our table. And to boot the waitress stood there staring at us which is why the ma'am please leave us alone. It was like she was a demon possessed.  Before I imploded, we had to walk out. Never ever again will we return here. Time to find somewhere else to enjoy my daughters birthday."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful prices, friendly staff, and if your in the south hills it's close by!  For the quantity and quality of food the price is right. It's the perfect place for dinner with friends on a cold winter evening. They also have a very decent wine list.    Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Mediocre in all areas. The best ambiance is when you walk in the door and see the beautiful cakes and loads of bread. The first disappointment was the panzanella salad. Costing $5 more than a house salad, I expected more than just croutons. Disappointment. Had the special, haddock. It was about a 2oz piece with butter and capers. Over cooked and dry. The company I keep was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food and atmosphere. The service was very rushed and it seems they are more concerned about flipping tables. Next time we will try sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"I struggle to write this review simply because this dining experience confused me. First, the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown Carnegie's main street. When you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with desserts and amazing looking house made breads. It rather looks like a deli counter. You have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area. A bit confusing layout, but tastefully done. The dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant. It felt much more upscale once in the dining area, but I did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique.   The food - A wide range of Italian dishes and seafood. We ordered the crab hozel as an appetizer. It was an average serving of lump crab meat, I had to ask for cocktail sauce. It was tasty, but cost us $18. We then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggies like artichokes, eggplant, peppers, etc. There were 4 smaller sized cutlets of veal and 3 shrimp. $28. There was no salad or pasta side offered. The dish was prepared properly and was OK. We just felt it needed something else.   Now the bread that was offered to our table came in a small basket and was filled with a variety of their house made breads. The pepperoni bread was AMAZING! I mean really delish. This alone I would have given 5 stars.   The service - Our server was...well....I'm not sure what he was quite frankly. Annoying?Confused? Hyper?  He appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time. Bouncing around the table, asking the same questions over and over, forgetful, spastic, etc. At one point one of my colleagues said, \"Is he on crack?\" We chuckled, but seriously! He forgot to even ask us if we wanted dessert, which was too bad because we saw some amazing looking offerings in the cases as we were leaving.  Overall - If I were in the area again I would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go, as they do sell it by the loaves. However, I think I would try somewhere else to dine."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. We started off with a Caesar salad, we asked is the dressing homemade we were told yes however I have had a number of homemade Caesars and this was deff not. They also topped it off with one crouton? My meal was the chicken breast with bone  in and broccoli. Chicken came out literally the size of chicken nuggets and my broccoli was basically raw and cold. I have three stars because the bread was actually really good and my finances meal was also mediocre. He had the eggplant rolitini and in my opinion it had a weird flavor. We would go back to try the pizza but I wouldn't suggest wasting 50 bucks on this meal."}
{"text":"While visiting a friend in Canondale, we visited Papa J's. It was a very crowded Saturday night and street parking was difficult. Papa J's feels like an *authentic* well oiled family business. When you walk in you are greeted by bread baking, a beautiful cake display and a host that has probably worked there (my assumption) 20 years.   Our service was good but not over the top. One of the best perks is that they bring out slices of the best homemade bread with olive oil, parmesan and balsamic. I could just sit there and eat bread it's that good. The dinner prices were very reasonable at around $15/pp not including alcohol.   I ordered the pesto pizza and my friends ordered the pasta bolognese and shrimp Alfredo.  I did not like my pizza at all and I am not a picky pizza eater. It looked pretty and fresh with the diced tomatoes and pine nuts on top-- but something was off. Maybe the cheese?   My friends thoroughly enjoyed their meals. They bring out a LOT of food.   Bottom line: I would give Papa J's another chance. I think I ordered the wrong thing. The service and atmosphere were great."}
{"text":"A unique and great find in downtown Carnegie. My fiance and I came here for a weekend lunch and wanted something different from our usual weekend spots. We had the sausage stuffed pepperoncini's as an appetizer (these are never my favorite and were just OK, but the marinara served with them was very tasty, as was their homemade bread), I had a really great wood fired meatball/ ricotta pizza and fiance had the chicken parm sandwich. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I ordered a cannoli on the way out the door and it was FANTASTIC. Not overly sweet, crunchy-chocolate dipped shell stuffed with thick cream and mini chocolate chips. Amazing. We will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. We always go and always really enjoy the food. But had to review this time. Place was packed service was great. Started with apps they were so good. Flavor was right on. We all had dinners amazing. The seafood pasta \"everything under the sea\"  OMG so good. So much fresh seafood it was insane. I  absolutely loved it. Great experience as always never a bad meal but this time it was so good had to write about it."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Loved the pesto sauce so my husband and I went back. I ordered the crab cakes and for a sit down restaurant was shocked to see them come out deep fried with little shreds of crab. I could of got better at the deli case at giant eagle. Awful. I didn't even know what to  say.  If you go, just get simple pastas."}
{"text":"Oh Papa J's, what has happened to you?? When we used to dine in, it felt like we were in someone's home in Italy and almost made us forget we were in the middle of Pittsburgh.  Although the waitstaff is still very friendly, all the food just falls flat.   This last time, The chicken Picata comes in a bland, buttery soup, with rubbery, warm chicken- no capers and with brown, overcooked broccoli. The pasta bolognese had no semblance of meat in it and was completely bland.   After so many times of chalking up to \"maybe they are just having a bad night\"and giving it just one more try, we unfortunately can't come back."}
{"text":"Thought it was awesome... first time I've been there and with most of the family...16 of us... they accommodated us well... The sever was very knowledgeable and was fast... as expected since such a big party... Food was great although I over stuffed with appetizers, bread & oil,and beverages...  Not your average Italian restaurant"}
{"text":"The menu has lots of choices and the food is great! The Resturante has been expanded so it's pretty large. The new section has door that they leave open during nice weather which makes for a nice ambience! The bread is great and fresh baked daily!"}
{"text":"Well, Papa J's has officially priced itself out of our budget. We ordered 2 salads with gorgonzola and pine nuts and the total was $35.98!!! $18 per salad??!?!? Really?! I was stunned when I saw the bill! It's lettuce, cheese, and pine nuts! $18 / salad?! Totally crazy!"}
{"text":"This lovely Italian restaurant is located on E Main St in Carnegie. It's got a nice corner storefront and a lot of space, as well as parking, so it's super easy to get to.   I've been here a handful of times, and the service is always pretty quick and friendly. Your meal starts off with some warm, crusty Italian bread - the most recent time we went, there were a few pieces of cinnamon raisin bread mixed in too!   The pasta here is always solid and a good sized portion. The napolitiano is ridiculously cheesy - be ready for that if you order it! It's delicious and filling. All of the pastas are customizable - you choose your pasta type and the sauce. They also have options for other, fancier pastas like tortellini, gnocchi, and ravioli.   They also have a great selection of fish and meat entrees as well as pizza and sandwiches. Their menu is huge, so definitely likely to find something you like :)"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner, drinks or a small celebration.  Papa J's is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we don't have reservations and want a nice dinner out. My husband and I have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy. I have been proved wrong.  We are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes. Unfortunately, the alternate bar/lounge area isn't always open. I really don't understand why more people don't go here.  My favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.The zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. The wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. My husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. Also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. Make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table.   Also, if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event, consider Papa Js. They have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties. We had our rehersal dinner for our wedding here and everyone loved the food."}
{"text":"Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"5 Stars. It's that good. Freshly made, and you can taste that it is. The pasta alfredo was made to order. It was so delicious, I think they used the pasta water to make the sauce, incredible. Reasonbly priced. Clean atmosphere. Knowledgable server, thank you Patrick. We had a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Literally just walked out after waiting at our table for 15 minutes with no server in site. We were never even offered drinks. It was embarrassing! Others came in after us ans were serves. Not us. Your food may be good, but the service is deplorable! Just so rude."}
{"text":"The arugula salad was perfect in its simplicity- light garlicky vinaigrette, and a few shaves of Romano. Partner's Caesar salad did not disappoint but no anchovies in the dressing. Informed they had just lost their baker so only had plain Italian - which was nice & chewy inside w a nice crust. My partner's chicken Alfredo was good. I had the Italian sausage w fett, caramelized onions & peppers. While I understand light sauce, the sauce was VERY light, & watery at bottom of bowl. The onions were not caramelized, as described in the menu but sautéed to crunchy, same as the peppers. Overall an enjoyable evening in this surprisingly atmospheric restaurant."}
{"text":"Our extremely poor service overshadowed our visit to Papa J's. We were seated in the upper area and had a group reservation. Before our waiter even introduced himself, he told us how we need to hurry up and order because they were \"about to get busy\". When we asked for more bread, he told us we could only have a little bit more. This was us asking for a second helping of bread, not a 3rd or 4th. And we were rushed out with a speech given TWICE by our waiter that made us feel like we had to leave. He also commented that our table ate a lot of food - we had not ordered any appetizers or desserts, yet he had to comment on this? A server should know better than to make these kind of comments. Not sure if we will return - would absolutely hate to get this waiter on our next visit."}
{"text":"This is it. My favorite in the Pittsburgh area.   I moved out of the area for 10 years and this was the first meal I had back. There was a table of Italians speaking Italian behind me - how much more authentic can you get?!?  I bring all of my out of town guests here and not one had been left disappointed. My recommendations are to order the mozzarella carozza (or however it's spelled) and then one of the specials. If you aren't into a special, you'll be fine - order off the menu. But the specials are typically amazing.   When my better half was living 4 hours away, he drove into town and I made him get back in he car to go here. Instead if complaining, he asked if we could take his parents next time."}
{"text":"2nd times a charm. This place was 3.5 starts the first time I came, but stepped up large tonight.  Waitress was righteous and very fun.  Food was all excellent.  Caesar salad tasty--got with tomatoes big $ on that, fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor.  Can't wait for the leftovers!!  The white pizza is that star though.  The crust/dough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf.  I don't throw those accolades out easily, especially on pie, but this joint serves it up.  Good vibe, great service, phenomenal food.  Ill be back."}
{"text":"Man has this place gone down hill.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago.  We had salads and pasta.  Both were on the verge of inedible.  With a single glass of wine, I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  Seriously, I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. Classico is better.  And the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didn't want to deal with it.  Seriously, I'd rather eat at the OG."}
{"text":"I thought the interiors were very nice.  We stopped here on a Friday night & I was glad they weren't busy because nothing else in the area looked appetizing.    My daughter & I split a chicken parm sandwich, which was really good. Instead of it being served on a hoagie, it was served on thin bread- like focaccia or something.  It was pretty good- little messy.  The desserts looked amazing.  I thought it was pretty cool how you can watch the cooks prepare the food from outside.  The kitchen is situated on a corner with lots of windows.  I would return."}
{"text":"The service was rushed. The server was talking so fast that I could barely understand what he was saying. I asked which entrée he enjoyed and he suggested a pan fried veal dish which was luckluster and bland. Being my first time at Papa J's I wasn't sure how the menu worked. He did not suggest pasta to go along with our meals. When the meals came we had to order our pasta and wait 10 minutes to receive it. I did not receive the value I look for at this price point. I could see this place being good, but I feel that rushing and the lack of menu tour guiding unfortunately ruined the experience from the beginning."}
{"text":"Fantastic gem in Pittsburgh. We were up in Pittsburgh for a family function and looking for a great Italian joint for dinner, we reviewed Yelp and discovered PaPa J's, we couldn't be happier! The food was spot on, and there was absolutely nothing wrong with the meal. If your looking for authentic Italian, don't miss this place."}
{"text":"You guys trust me right.  Atmosphere is great here. I really enjoy coming. Over priced for quality of good, but, there is always a buy one get one entree coupon available all over online.  I can't give 5 stars cause service can be hit or miss. I recommend this place for Friday and Saturday for awesome happy hours and apps.  Good place to start the Carnegie Bar Crawl.  Very nice, classy place"}
{"text":"Plenty of food for the pricing.   Great flavor.  Ambience is lacking a bit but pleasant service and extensive menu."}
{"text":"Many trips to Pittsburgh over 20 years.  First time here.  Had the gnocchi special.  One of the best Gnocchi I have ever had.  Pizza was excellent.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Worst service of all time. 2 hours for a pizza and had to repeat ourselves to the waiter 5 time throughout the night. Then asked for the bill and was given a bill 3 times the amount ours should have been with a bunch of items that should not be on there. Place is a total joke."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner last night with a client.  This is second time I visited.  I had a scotch and he had a Guiness.  The (-1) is for drink selection. Just stock some better beers and higher end scotch and you're five stars.  We started with the meatballs covered with Provolone and other blessed goodness.  These did not disappoint.  I had a four cheese pizza with sweet sausage and garlic.  It was fantastic.  They have so many good dishes, but I wanted the pizza last night.  I couldn't finish the pizza - way to go big medium pizza.  I finished up with a coffee.  The parking can be a bit of a challenge on the street, but it's a small town atmosphere in Carnegie, PA.  I love the downtown there."}
{"text":"Great, authentic, classic Italian restaurant in one of the most unlikely places.   I grew up eating here and make a visit nearly every time I come to town.  Try the fried calamari \"Roman Style\" for a little kick!"}
{"text":"We came to Carnegie to check out the Black Lamb consignment shop. Lucky for us that we also discovered PaPa J's--we loved it! The fried calamari appetizer was excellent, as was the fettuccine carbonara. We'll be headed back to this place as often as we can for a real Italian dining experience."}
{"text":"Just to start off, we were a party of 12, which is always a little difficult.  We were celebrating 2 birthdays.  We LOVED the food, it was delicious. My husband got a chicken parm sandwich, which is served on a yummy flat bread, and I got the chicken basil pizza ( i got an 8 cut and several ppl tried it) we all LOVED it! It was stunning.  It was made with a very delicious crust, nice and crisp, not soggy (like pesto pizza can get)  The one waitress we had JASMINE, was fantastic!  She was bright, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  She took extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections...   Now... the other waitress.. Mary something was so incompetent...  She was awful and rude.  She missed 2 people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said 'well they didn't speak up!' Ugh.  Then when it was time to sing and cut the cake, my sister in law said 'oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing?'  She came back, cut the cake (all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake) and we didn't even sing!  We were mad!!  The place is so pretty, they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years (according to my father in law) and its really nice.  They look to have a cool bar area with some modern couches and a really sweet look.     So good food, great looking place.. one bad waitress. Prices are about middle of the road for an authentic Italian place, nothing crazy.  All in all, we'd like to go back again, but we want Jasmine!"}
{"text":"Met up here with two sets of family heading out of town (This is a great restaurant in a location ideal if you're meeting someone headed to, or you yourself are headed to the airport from town.)  The food was great, the atmosphere was fun and family friendly (white tablecloths and lots of light, along with tasteful decor made it feel sophisticated, but it's loud enough and crayons w/paper place settings make it great for kids (there were three in our 10 person group ranging from 8 months to 12 years old)  They also were very attentive to dietary restrictions (one very pleased lactose intolerant person in our party later remarked.)    Only downside is that there are no changing tables in the tiny restrooms. They looked like they might be expanding into the space next door, though so maybe that will change.  Wasn't crowded when we were there though - more people should go here!"}
{"text":"This place was recommend to me via friends but in going there for my first time I must say, it was not a great impression. The server I had was rude to begin, we were evidently his last table of his shift and he hovered over us just about the whole time. I understand wanting to go home, but i want to enjoy my experience dining. The food... meh... Not bad, but not amazing. Bread was great! But the Caesar salad was WAY too soggy, and the meal I had was just Warm to the touch as if the server forgot about it for a minute, or five....  I may try it again but not anytime soon. Hopefully the outcome is better!"}
{"text":"During college I frequented the PaPa J's in downtown Pittsburgh and I was extremely saddened when I heard it had closed.  This was my first trip out to Carnegie to celebrate my father in law's birthday. There were five of us. Immediately upon arrival we were seated (we had made a reservation). Our waiter, Mark, was very attentive. Our waters were always filled and he checked in on us just enough that it wasn't overbearing. He also refilled our bread (which was excellent) and oil/vinegar to dip in quickly upon request. The service was excellent.   I had the bolognese and wedding soup. Both were excellent. Three other guests had chicken parm and penne. My husband had shrimp with thin spaghetti in oil and garlic. The portions were huge and we had leftovers. The only complaint (minor) was the garden salad. Too much lettuce, not enough other toppings, and not enough dressing.   I will definitely return to this location!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.    I was greeted by a large open (garage style) window, that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  It had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.  Ordered the quattro formaggi pizza.  Quite good!!!  Great balance of cheeses.  Not too rich at all.  Crust was excellent too.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Service was great. Apps delish, specifically the stuffed banana peppers & lentil with ham soup. I think I chose the wrong entree though because I ordered a cod with crabmeat special. The cod was completely tasteless with some crabmeat layed across the top. It all reminded me of boiled fish. Yuck! Note to self. Order the pasta!"}
{"text":"Had their sunday breakfast/brunch buffet which was excellent. Could have had more variety for the price but overall, the food was good and so was the service."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my wife and 3 other couples.  Another couple in our party had made reservations before hand and when we arrived a couple of minutes after that time, we were immediately taken to our table.  Whenever you first walk into Papa Js you immediately head past both their dessert case and bread making area.  That is pure genius on their part as both their desserts and bread look good!  Then to get to our table we also walked past a bar and up a flight of stairs.  After that I didn't really see much else of the restaurant.  After our whole party had arrived and our waitress had taken all of our drink orders she came back up to our table and promised us that she would be back shortly as she had some desserts to take to a table.  After about 15 minutes or so she finally did make it back to our table.  For my dinner entree I decided on having the Romano chicken.  It came out a short time later with a side of broccoli.  The chicken had a nice golden color to its breading and tasted pretty good although a bit salty.  I can take at least some credit for that though as I may have used the Parmesan that was on the table quite liberally.  Meanwhile the broccoli was over cooked for my tastes and seemed mushy whenever I bit into it.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  I wouldn't be the person to recommend it but I also wouldn't turn it down.  I feel like the prices were fair for what you got and only wish that the service was a little better."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. My husband and I had our first date here so that's why we chose this place for our rehearsal dinner. The food is phenomenal. They were so accommodating for the guests we had that had allergies. They recommended various ways for us to save money like bringing our own wine and dessert. They were incredibly attentive and everything was just perfect. I can't say enough good things! Every time we come here the food is wonderful and the staff polite and helpful. We will definitely continue to keep coming back here for years to come!"}
{"text":"Not happy with the quality of meat. The Italian Sausage was bad quality and was burnt to a crisp. Second try was the same bad quality meat for the price. I have paid 5 dollars for a stand Italian Sausage and it tasted much better, and it didn't have to be cut in half, it would just melt in your mouth being so tender. The Sausage they have here has too much skin, and it just didn't go well with the pita bread since it was tough no matter how much they cooked it. The salads are okay for the price but you could make your own just as well at home, would go to the Olive Garden for a better deal with salad. The pizza was a 5 out of 10 but I prefer the thin crispy kind.  I really wanted this place to be great since I will be moving here this month but will be going elsewhere."}

{"text":"What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.  First off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.  I am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.    The server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.    We also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.    By the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.    One of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.    They had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.  Overall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.  My only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!"}
{"text":"We met our good friends from Morgantown here for lunch today and were really impressed with the place itself and the menu.   I had read a few of the reviews ahead of time and the pizza was mentioned more than once so by the time we got there, I was jonesing for it.   It certainly delivered. The crust was great, the sauce wast too sweet and the toppings were sufficient.   Our friend for the baby clams with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bit - as good as the pizza was, this was _much_ better.   We'll return again to this beautifully lit gem in Carnegie PA soon!"}
{"text":"A large group of us have enjoyed an excellent dinner for the past three years and each year it gets better and better.  We order entrees from all areas of the menu. The bread and antipasto are exceptional.  Attentive and friendly staff with strong knowledge of the menu."}
{"text":"Hotel clerk recommended this place. It was phenomenal. The food was the best Italian I have ever eaten, and the service was top notch. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Eh.. Atmosphere is ok not so totally impressed. Good was pretty good but not the greatest ever."}
{"text":"What a class act!  Feels like a restaurant right in Italy.  Beautiful linen draped, candlelit tables with a selection of dining areas.  Extensive menu.  Wonderful wedding soup, obviously house made.  Every entree in our group was superb.  Chicken and pork dishes wonderful.  Pasta cooked properly and great sauce.  Wait staff were neatly well dressed and extremely cordial.  This restaurant is a must!  Had a great Pecan ball and luscious yellow cake for dessert."}
{"text":"It started out as what was supposed to be a decent meal, but that all changed after the first five minutes.  The waitress, who was as mean as a snake, gave me a disgusted look as I asked for pesto to go with the bread.  She then proceeded to tell me that they didn't have pesto, though it was right on the menu.  My veal was insanely overcooked and the tenderness was comparable to that of rocks.  The sauce that the veal came in had the acidity of concentrated white vinegar. The bread, however, was pretty nice.  When it came time to get dessert, I had ordered the almond cake, the waitress left for a while, then came back and told me that there was no almond cake, and when one of my family members joked about it, the waitress rolled her eyes so hard that I thought she might flip over.  The level of disgust that I left the restaurant with was of incalculable magnitude."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with very good food at a pretty reasonable price.  We had a birthday dinner here with seven girlfriends. The waitress was very efficient , but not very friendly. Our orders came out hot and excellently prepared!  Try the tilapia milanese , it's excellent. Best steamed broccoli Iv'e ever had."}
{"text":"Papa J's was one of the cutest places I have been to eat, not to mention that their food was delicious. Their in-house bread is delicious and served with oils/ butter to use at your pleasure. I ordered the spinach and feta pasta with fettuccini noodles, and what I expected to be \"just pasta\" tasted incredible. There was so much flavor in nearly every bite I took. Honestly I was throughly impressed with the waiter's service and the atmosphere of the restaurant.   Side note- their tables are covered with white paper overtop of the table cloth and crayons are provided to doodle while you wait (genius idea) their dessert portions looked huge, as I was leaving I walked past a table and the slice of cake infant of the one guest looked very big and probably tastes great."}
{"text":"Our pizza was cold and our drinks where empty.  We are not going back.!  The waitress started as attentive, but slowly slipped away to the point where things became frustrating."}
{"text":"Here is an excerpt from an unbelievable response to my review, provided by the restaurant two months after the fact: \"...I chose not to respond to you because your letter had a voice that was disingenuous and mechanical, publicly accusatory and defaming.   I am grateful to be of service, and response duly to every guest complaint but you have made a terroristic act in your public display and I do not feel any need to respond to that.  -Michael Troiani\"    The customer is always wrong at Papa J's: criticism of an observant diner will not be accepted."}
{"text":"I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit.   From the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.  But it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.  My biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless.   But before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \"mistake\" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).  My opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in the city, homemade breads, favorites, reasonable prices and a great wait staff. Worth the trip from anywhere."}
{"text":"Did dinner with my GF last Saturday at PaPa J's prior to going to the Off The Wall Theater. This was the first time we've been to this restaurant. We usually stop a Riley's Pour House across the street for a bite before seeing a show in this town but today we decided to shake it up and do something different.  The place is deceptively larger than it looks from the outside. It was also busier than we would have expected on this particular evening and we got one of the remaining tables which was located near the entrance and the bar. The traffic from both the customers and the staff that flowed past us was a little noisy and distracting and we could tell that's why it was one of the last tables available. But our waitress came by promptly, got us drinks (I had a Hoegaarden and my girl ordered an Absolute water and cranberry), gave us menus and recited the specials of the day.  After viewing the menu for a bit, I decided on the Veal Parmigiano; my date went with one of the specials, a chicken and broccoli gnocchi dish. The plates took about 15 minutes to arrive and the portions were humongous... enough for a filling lunch the next day. My veal was tender and delicious but it's really the gnocchi that left the biggest impression. You could tell that it was house made; it was like little fluffy pillows dissolving in your mouth with each bite. I never tasted gnocchi like it before.  Over all I give PaPa J's a big thumbs up. The food was good, most of the dinning area's seemed cozy, the building itself has a certain charm with its high ceiling and the tables draped in white table cloths give it a pristine appearance. Although I thought it was a bit pricy, I didn't feel as if I've been taken.  Other than the location of our table, it was the pre-theater perfect meal. I only hope get a more intimate table next time we stop for dinner."}
{"text":"Been here a more than a few times. Nice relaxing place in Carnegie. Sometimes the service can be a little iffy but I like the food and cocktails. I really like the open area bar seating for happy hour. Will continue to go."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.  Waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  Saved his tip by discounting meal after I complained.  All and all, a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests.  Not to be repeated, never again!"}
{"text":"Always a treat to have dinner at Papa J's ! Been going there for years and the quality is always the best. Always proud to take new peeps to savor the menu delights! Michael from Mt. Lebanon."}
{"text":"We came here for a business luncheon which I think most folks do. It's a quaint little spot with a cool bakery up front.   The service was a bit lacking considering it was kind of slow...as in it took 20 minutes to get a black coffee.   One of us ordered a pizza, a sandwich and I had a salad. The sandwich was HUGE like good for 2 hungry people for sure.   The vegetarian pizza looked good - not too greasy/soggy.   The salad was so-so.   I really wish they had more vegan options but it's an Italian spot so....yeah. It's still good for you \"meaties\"."}
{"text":"I wrote a letter to the Papa J's, but did not receive a reply therefore I will share my experience online.  Tonight a friend and I dined at your location. We were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk, which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials. Our server took our order of a gingerale, fried zucchini appetizer, side salad, wedding soup , eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata ( correct spelling).  We thoroughly enjoyed the bread & wedding soup. The side salad was rather bland and unexciting, lacking flavor & texture. The Spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce, a single slice of tomato and one black olive. I would have expected some additions such as onions, peppers, cheese, cucumbers, croutons, carrots and the like.     We enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer, but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal, so we asked the server ( bartender ) about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to \"put it in\". He offered to put it in at this point, but advised us that our meals would be out soon. We decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to.      The main dishes were acceptable, not outstanding. The eggplant was very tasty and well prepared.  The Chicken Piccata was flavorful, but not as expected. The chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked. It had no signs of being coated and sautéed  to a rich golden brown. The chicken was just pale white. The sauce was a simple lemon flavor, it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken. I tasted no garlic or shallots. The sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers, which were absent.  No pasta was served with the chicken. The side of vegetables were well cooked, buy again lacked any real flavor. The would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars.    Once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another 20 minutes for the check. The server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers. The total was $43 and change. I would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order, but no such offer was made and  I saw no manager come around and check on the customers, as is customary. I am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience.  I hope this feedback will be beneficial to your business."}
{"text":"OK, its Friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. Driving by Papa J's and W says, lets stop in and get a quick dinner.   Advice host that we are in a hurry.  The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!  Just as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  In and out in 60 minutes.  Now that is some good service."}
{"text":"Service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are \"just\" working . They have nice decor,nice bar and good bread. Consider where this place is ,the prices are really really high . Nothing is served on the side with main dishes ...."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. There are some really great things about it and some not so great things about it.  First, both trips to Papa Js were bad to terrible service. We ordered a bottle of wine, got glasses instead, wrong orders, no water refill after asking a couple of times, no one asking how anything is, blah blah blah. Just a bad experience.  The food is good. Nothing that isn't better at other Italian restaurants in the area, but pretty good. This last trip we had a mozzarella appetizer and it was unexpectedly good. Big, breaded ball of cheese, deep fried and served on some good marinara.  The meals have been mediocre overall. They offer fresh baked bread with oil and balsamic that's pretty tasty, too. I just want more from this place. It's just okay."}
{"text":"Papa J's is by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, my hometown.  I eat there almost every time I visit, and everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic.  Fresh ingredients, simple preparation, reasonable prices.  Also, they make the best pizza in town HANDS DOWN."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. Service is professional, food beautifully presented. Wide selection of pasta dishes. Love the smell of fresh baked breads when walking in. It's a little more expensive, but it's easily one of the best Italian restaurants in my area."}
{"text":"Love this place especially the garden salad with feta and pine nuts. When I am working close to Carnegie, I schedule my day around lunch here. The homemade breads are amazing too. Great atmosphere and service make this one of my favorites close to Downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Some items a little over priced. But never disappointed.  I have friends that LOVE the white pizza. I have seen two people eat their weight in the stuff.  I love their fresh salads. HUGE. The house dressing is perfect every time. We have been there many times and it just doesn't get old.  We always have the beans and greens. The meatball appetizer is superb. By-pass the chicken parm, it's the only thing we have ever found lacking....it's just really plain. The alfredo is excellent.  We, almost never go anywhere else in Carnegie because we like this place so much."}
{"text":"I remember when this location  opened back in the early 90s. It was one of the first foodie-style places to hit the Pittsburgh area. Everything was top notch. Everything. Pizza. Pastas. Mozzarella wedges. Bread. Salads. Drinks. Everything. In my early 20s when they opened my friends and I would treat ourselves to meals once a week (usually hungover) as it was just a mere walk from my apartment. Going back over the years I feel like it's hit or miss. Sometimes it's as tremendous as my first visit and other times it's just ok. I would like to see consistency like the old days."}
{"text":"Very disappointed and will never go back. Seafood portions very small and left hungry 2 times.  One, fish and 1 small spear of broccoli and 1 time, small piece of fish under small portion of greens. Had a coupon. One time we went there, the server lost it from the table to the register even though with the payment and the other time, wouldn't take it because they didn't consider  a sandwich an entree even though it was about the same cost as a fish dish. If you look up the definition of entree, it is defined as \"the main course'. Think their coupons are a switch and bait scam and would never recommend Papa's J to anyone."}
{"text":"Talk about overpriced. $18 for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously frozen chicken chopped up over it. The latter was terrible, thin and flabby and rather unappealing. The pasta itself was ok, as was the sauce. The desserts are pretty good. But honestly, that is a $10 dish whose price has been inflated."}
{"text":"Coming here you get the feeling they haven't changed much.  The tables, the decorations, the menu.  All the same.  Does that make you a little worried?  Yes.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  Very very oily.  The actual ravioli was okay, enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  Did I mention that?    Ambiance, like I said, left much to be desired.  I don't think I'd have this place on my list of \"musts\" for downtown.  Much better restaurants to visit!"}
{"text":"Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.  The bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.  I'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing."}
{"text":"The food was ok no Complaints  it is sitting at the bar and watching  the male bartender  stand around  doing literally  nothing  while the woman bartender  bust her ass made it a uncomfortable  night especially  knowing  that  they will pull tips not returning  again and shame on the two manager  for not notice  it"}
{"text":"Papa J's is very close to our house and we love the food.  Its a shame that the service is so terrible. Last year I brought 11 people out for my birthday dinner and everyone left with the same thought, the food was great but the waiter was rude.  She actually made our entire table feel uncomfortable with how much sass she gave us. A few months later we decided to try again and bring our friends from out of town. Once again we had a male waiter who was very rude and ignorant to us becuase we brought 2 childern, but the food was great.  Each visit I was disappointed with the service, but never the food.  It's disappointing that the servers are so rude and unwelcoming or we would be coming more often."}
