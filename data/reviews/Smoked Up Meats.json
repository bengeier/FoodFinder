{"text":"I've been craving a smoked meat sandwich for a while and was pleasantly surprised to find that there is a joint close to home. I already had lunch that day but having a late second lunch is okay too :)  I ordered the 6oz brisket sandwich combo which came with two sides and a can of pop.  The sandwich was loaded with chunks of meat, had a nice layer of sauerkraut, and mustard. The brisket had nice flavour on its own but when combined with the sauerkraut, it tasted like heaven. It complimented the brisket so well. For sides I chose fries and coleslaw. The coleslaw was good but had a bit too much dressing for my liking. It's creamy coleslaw and I prefer the vinaigrette variety.   Overall it was a good meal with good portions. I'll definitely come back next time I'm craving a brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"First I'll start with a disclaimer; I don't like fat on my food   Newer spot in the vellore woods area that sells smoked meat, ribs and porcetta and chicken sandwiches   My first visit I would have gave it a 5 and I was quite excited about this new spot so much so I went for a second visit within a week  The smoked meat sandwich was not as lean as my first visit and I would have gave it a on the cusp 4  Third and possibly final visit I got fat laden meat and not happy at all. It was good enough before so I'll keep at a 3 as this visit experience was a 2  The jerk ribs sound interesting for any non Jamaican, porcetta is supposed to be good and I was planning to try the chicken   Overall it's a place to try and if you like fatty smoked meat you'll definitely want to give it a try if in the area."}
{"text":"Good quality meat for sure. Montreal style, smoked meat goodness. The beef brisket is made deli style (aka mustard, sauerkraut, the whole works). Really sweet staff as well!"}
{"text":"This shop is conveniently located near my office so it's very easy to step in for a quick bite.  The beef brisket sandwich hits the spot and the ribs are tasty too.  My favourite has to be the porchetta sandwich with rapini.  With all the meat shops in the area making Italian-style porchetta, the competition is strong and this one holds its own.  The staff are very friendly and the service is always great."}
{"text":"One hearty sandwich that doesn't fall short by any means. This place is a much needed gem. I'll be back. I had the 8oz. brisket with a poutine and was in love. Guys, if you're a fan of Montreal smoked meats hit them up. Next I gotta try their crispy chicken sandwich, got a glimpse of one on the way out. And to be honest, it looked like it just came out of a commercial or something. That thing was joyously dancing out of the bun."}
{"text":"Great food, had the the smoked beef brisket sandwich, great portion for good price nice chunks of brisket meat in the sandwuch. They actually have smoked FRIED chicken,  my next option when I come back.  Food arrived quick and fresh, combo comes with two sides, and it was fulfiling"}
{"text":"Smoked up Meats is a hidden gem in a not so busy plaza.  The food is well deserved of praise.  The only draw back is that the plaza it's in doesn't drive in traffic and remains relatively quiet. I'm afraid that this place might be here for a short time.  I tried the montreal smoked meat sandwich and is cooked perfectly.  It is definitely quality over quantity.  Their combos are quite reasonable as they provide two sides and a drink.   I'll go again and provide pictures next time.  To the owner/chef, thank you for feeding the neighborhood.  Highly recommend."}
