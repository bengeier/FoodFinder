{"text":"Three and a half stars. Came here for dim sum based on the Yelp reviews. Dim sum here is ok. Gave the extra half stars as the service is quick and attentive and washrooms here are actually clean - rare bonuses for Chinese restaurants :-) Ordered about 7 dishes and the bill came just over $40 -a little more expensive given the quality of food was just ok. The fried turnip cake was not pan fried long enough resulting in a soggy texture -3/5. The shrimp dumpling (har gow) was good but I've had better 3.5/5. We ordered 2 soup dumplings (price was XL) which unfortunately did not have much taste - 2/5. The pork dumplings (siu mi) were ok 3.5/5. Spring rolls were good and actually had whole pieces of shrimp - 4/5. Best dish was the rice rolls with shrimp (har cheung fun) 5/5.  Will return if I'm in the neighbourhood, but there are so many dim sum restaurants in the Scarborough/Markham area that I would like to explore further. Worth a try for those who live close by."}
{"text":"Their food are great and delicious. Waiters there are ppoloite and helpful. The settings are also great. However, there are much msg in their food which would make you thirtsy afterward. Personally, I would prefer delicious over no msg. The price are ok here."}
{"text":"I came here for a family brunch on new years day. It was surprisingly not busy.. may be due to the fact that it is a little pricier than your average dim sum restaurant.   I tried their famous pineapple bun with bbq pork filling and it was heavenly! Sounds like an odd combination but you have to try it to believe it!  The only thing that would stop me from coming back here again is the price. The clientele here seems to consist of more caucasians and english speakers than the typical chinese dim sum restaurant; this may be due to the area that it's in."}
{"text":"I had such a bad experience in legend. I took my family for dim sum and ordered bunch of typical dim sum dishes. During the meal, I saw some black piece on my mom's siu mai. When I looked closer, it is a cockroach sticked on the siu mai! So disgusting! We called the waitress. She was so nervous and the first thing she did was to take away the dish (to destroy the evidence). The manager was not helpful either. She told us no need to pay for the meal but there was nothing else she could do. I was so disappointed at this restaurant and I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Our monthly dim sum meetup group had a great turnout for Legend Chinese. The food was was good (egg tarts!) with the opinion that certain dishes were lackluster (turnip cake) and some items were better at Sky Dragon (green beans) or Rol San (buns). You order off cards. The service was good and fast. The tab was $17.50 each, all in.  Visited: April 20, 2014"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years and it has the best service and dim sum by far. Their dinner menu is fantastic and can't find another restaurant that tops it!"}
{"text":"Food is way overpriced compared to other dim sum restaurants, yet quality is only mediocre.  The cleanliness is also a big concern.  The regular rice dish was served inside the bamboo container that they use to serve all other dim sum dishes with.  Other restaurants all use a porcelain bowl to serve the rice dish.  I don't think they clean the bamboo containers very often...seems kinda gross to me!"}
{"text":"Traditional, authentic,quality dim sum. This one and Dragon boat on hwy 7 are the ones that I frequent.if u want real dim sum, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Bad customer service!!! The staff made a mistake during order taking and served up a wrong dish. When we pointed this out, the lead staff intervened (a lady with multi colored dyed hair) hinted that the mistake was ours and suggested we accept the dish since it was already cooked. Fearing what they might do if we insist on a change, we reluctantly agreed...  In terms of food, taste was so-so, quite salty and certainly not worth the extra $$$ compared to some other restaurants. First and last visit here. Hope other customers are not as unlucky."}
{"text":"Tried the Dim Sum today and the taste is not as good as what other reviews said, plus the  I order siu mai and the fish eggs on top of it were not fresh. Steamed beef ball is too salty, the hakau is just regular taste...nothing special. Only the deep fried tentacles were good. Compare to Fancy Chinese Restaurant in Markham, this one is far below but the price is double."}
{"text":"Based on the amount of positive reviews I saw for Legend, I decided to give it a try myself.   Although the price per plate here is more expensive than the joints I normally go to in Markham/ Richmond Hill (starts at $2 or $2.50) this place is definitely worth the price. The shrimps in their dishes are HUGE and cooked correctly. Restaurant decor is nice as well and service is good.  Definitely going back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"A group of us went to Legend Chinese Restaurant Saturday afternoon and the experience turned out to be a pleasant surprise. This restaurant is located just north of Steeles Avenue along the Yonge street corridor where it is situated next to an Italian eatery (Nino D'aversa), a Red Lobster, and a Korean supermarket along with some other restaurants and stores. The restaurant is a good size and would be adequate for groups.  The decor was also decent for a dim sum restaurant with real tablecloths etc.  Also, it was a very pleasant surprise to not have to wait for a table (we were a group of 4 and at 1;30pm on Saturday afternoon, there was a 5 minute wait to get a table). Now, as far as the food goes (which is perhaps the most important part), it was quite good.  Having 4 members in our group allowed us to try a large variety of dishes and everything we had was consistently good and of decent quality.  It may not have been the best dim sum that we have had, but it was easily on par with most of the good dim sum places across the city.  The Har Gow was quite good, and in my humble opinion, the quality of a good dim sum restaurant can largely be judged by the quality of their Har Gow.  The food was served promptly and you could tell it was prepared fresh and served hot.  The flavours were quite good and the ingredients used were of a higher quality. The service was also good in that it was prompt and friendly. In terms of value, it's hard for me to comment as one member of our group was feeling very generous and decided to pick up the tab, however he seemed to feel the meal was well worth the cost - but perhaps that was because of the great company!  So, is this restaurant a legend in the making?  Not quite, but it is quite good and definitely worth trying if you are looking for above average dim sum in the Yonge and Steeles area."}
{"text":"One of my all time favourite places for dim sum!  They are a bit more expensive than other places, but I've never had a bad dish.  Some of my faves are shrimp beancurd roll, minced meat football puff, chicken feet, har gow, shrimp cheung fun, fried squid tentacles, stewed beef tendon, black bean pork ribs, shui mai....OK, OK, I love dim sum food period.  I've also had the pleasure of eating Peking Duck there, twice.  Both times were great.  The pancakes were soft, and the duck was not overly greasy (I've had Peking Duck at other places that make you sick from the grease!).  Perfect duck skin should be crisp and a touch oily, but not soaked with grease.  Service is usually good, available in English, Cantonese and Mandarin.  Parking lot is large and convenient.  When you're done eating, you can even check out Nino D'Aversa Bakery for a cannoli."}
{"text":"A gem in Thornhill.   Not many people know about it (everyone thinks of Markham/Richmond Hill), but this place offers really good quality food and quick service. Had tried dim sum and multi course banquet and it consistantly delivers."}
{"text":"Best dimsum I've ever had in Toronto area. Quick service, delicious food, decent amount of waiting time and again, delicious food!"}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to dim sum and dinner restaurant. There are few great Chinese restaurants in the Thornhill area.   Although the dim sum is not fancy like the Casa Victoria chain, the dim sum is consistent, the food comes out hot and the servers are friendly.   Some stand out dim sum dishes include the egg custard bun, curry pot pies with minced meat and egg tarts.   I've been here several times for dinner and for banquet functions. I had my daughter's One Month party here, and it was a breeze working with the Managers to organize the event. They were organized and accommodating. The 10 course dinner was delicious and included whole roasted pig, twin lobster and steamed sea bass.  The restaurant is beautiful, well maintained and looks clean."}
{"text":"Best dim sum I've had in a long time. Quality is superb."}
{"text":"Visiting as an \"out of towner\", I was craving some good dim-sum in a city with the reputation of having \"good Chinese food.\"  I was not disappointed!  Even though we got to the restaurant a bit late for dim sum, we were still able to order it.  There were no carts being pushed around, but instead there was a paper menu to pick off of.  Restaurant was clean and well-maintained.  There were English explanation on the paper menu, so I picked what sounded familiar as well as tried some new plates.    I'd recommend: Shrimp dumplings Sticky rice in leaves with meat filling Rice noodles with pork Rice noodles with shrimp Fried turnip with bean sprouts in XO sauce  We left wanting more and wishing that we could take some of this tasty goodness home!  I hope to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Living in Thornhill for a good portion of my life, I've visited this plaza on multiple occasions for the Italian bakery and Korean market, but I never thought to visit this restaurant. Craving dim sum one morning, my boyfriend and I visited Legend and we had a great experience. Upon arrival, we were seated in a private room (for just the two of us!) - unsure why, but it was a newer, quiet dim sum experience for us away from the hectic dining room environment that one normally would encounter at any dim sum restaurant.   We ordered the standard dim sum plates like siu mai, har gow, sticky rice in a lotus leaf, fried dumplings, etc. But the freshly baked egg tarts really was the winner that day. They came out fresh from the oven so it took a while to arrive at our table, but we loved how fresh and warm they were.   It's nice to know that there's an authentic dim sum restaurant close to home and that we no longer need to make the trek to Markham for decent dim sum. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Did I come here on their off-day? Doesn't really matter if they can't provide consistency, right?   I came here for dim sum Sunday morning at 11:00a.m. - apparently they give a discount before 11:30a.m., which I found out later that you have to PAY before 11:30a.m. to receive this cash discount.   So, aside from the price confusion, let's get down to business - the food was pretty bad.   1. Shrimp Dumpling (Har Gow) - The skin was cold and the shrimp inside was detached.. and tasted sour.  2. Beef Tendons - Overcooked, resulting in lack of texture.. I wanted some chewy tendons *insert sad face* 3. XLB Soup Dumplings - Refer to picture of raw pork fillings. I rather get food poisoning from a Cronut burger - that would have tasted better than this.   The above three items were among the most disappointing items we ordered, and everything else was meh (ie. rice rolls, beef balls). The egg tarts are delicious though! I think that was the freshest item on our table.   In summary, this place is not a cheap option for dim sum AND not recommended for quality & freshness."}
{"text":"Had no idea there was a dim sum place located right by Red Lobster as I've been there many times. I guess I was too preoccupied with my hunger for Red Lobster to notice (#basic)   We went around 12 and were seated quickly. The menu is pretty standard (e.g. siu mai, har gow, spare ribs, chicken feet, etc.). I highly recommend their deep fried chilli turnips with xo sauce (?, don't quote me on that). It's only available after 11:30ish I believe.   The service is prompt and quick as you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. They'd be taking the empty dishes left and right the moment you finish them (lol).   It was a nice change up from our favourite dim sum places. Can't really complain about my time there."}
{"text":"Good food, no line up, not expensive. They may sometimes take some time to get their food out but nothing too long. Better to have dim sum here w a larger group so that you can taste more dishes."}
{"text":"We were on the hunt for dim sum near Thornhill, and this one popped up on Yelp (thanks Yelp!). We arrived shortly after it opened on Saturday morning (just after 9:30 or so), and surprisingly, no wait! The restaurant wasn't busy, and the staff were okay friendly. Instead of the carts, there's a form you fill out with your choices. We picked our usuals, along with some new items. The food was definitely fresh and hot - so good! We took a bunch of stuff home too :) Not a bad choice for weekend dim sum in Thornhill."}
{"text":"I love legend and am a regular here, I've been here for dim sum over a dozen times and I always leave happy. This place doesn't have any of the stereotypical Chinese restaurant issues like dirty dishes or rude staff and the washrooms are usually well maintained. Staff is friendly but as with most places finding someone fluent in English can be tricky but they get the gist of most requests without too much issue. One thing I really like about legend is you will usually find a multicultural and diverse crowd eating here regularly because they treat everyone with respect and equality unlike many other dim sum places I've been too that can be quite rude and shitty with non-Chinese patrons.   The food here is priced in the mid range but I think it is well worth it, good sized portions and fairly quick, the food is always delicious. One thing I think they do better than most places that I've grown to love is the sago pudding, a nice sweet custard type dessert with some cashews, it's a big bowl, enough for 3 or 4 and a nice finisher after a delicious dim sum meal!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting this restaurant for dinner for many years on and off, and the one consistent thing about the place is the kitchen's performance. Typical with many \"Chinese Seafood Cuisine\" restaurants, many items are customized/off-menu, so for non-Chinese speakers this may be a tough place to order from and to get what you're expecting. If you know the manager, there's often more service and dessert on the house - same can be said if you're close with any other restaurants, so no surprise there.  The most recent time I visited was a family gathering of 10 - a typical large table for a Chinese dinner. In these situations, it's always ideal to order your menu days in advance - but this requires calling in and speaking to a manager, or visiting yourself a few days earlier and discussing in person. If you're green to this kind of process - come in. It will allow you to try their regular menu items and give you a sense of the pricing - custom menus mean the prices are ALL SEASONAL. On average, I would say your meal starts at about $30 per person, and increases with more seafood and delicacies your order. To avoid dispute, be up front about the occasion and your limits - be frank about \"don't want to spend too much\" and \"just a regular dinner, no special occasions\".  Friday dinner featured a four-pound deep sea bass (???) prepared two ways, hand-basted crispy roast chicken (?????), greens with mushroom variety, fish belly thick soup (?????), and beef brisket with chestnuts casserole. The fish was the highlight of the meal, and it was everything we promised. Filets were tossed with fresh veggies and the other parts were battered and fried, similar to when found in other Chinese fish casseroles. Fish was flavourful and the texture was excellent, and importantly it actually felt like we got our full weight of the four pounder as promised. The crispy chicken is a signature here, and typically requires preordering. The other dishes were standard, nothing disappointing but not much to write about.  For dessert we had an interesting progression - house dessert was a purple rice and tapioca hot sago - I highly recommend skipping it. It felt watered down and flavourless despite its appearance. Instead we got hot tapioca baked puddings - usually available during the day as part of dim sum, but if the kitchen isn't busy they can make them to order at dinner too. Lotus paste us generously layered between the tapioca pudding, making a rich dessert that itself isn't too sweet, with a gooey, bread pudding-like texture. We wrapped up with sesame filled rice balls (tongyuan) in syrup - a simple dessert that can also be made to order.  The bill came out to about $330 before tips for a table of ten, and we were more than satisfied. The volume of food was sufficient, though may feel underwhelming at first if you've got lots of big eaters. Presetting our menu made for a smooth night, and it wasn't too busy a night meaning the kitchen was accommodating of our special dessert requests.  The one thing that's a downer on this place is that a lot of prices are subjective - they start with a seasonally determined ballpark, and get marked up/down based on custom specifications and how well you know the manager. This is unfortunately more commonplace than some of us may believe - having a full listed menu with accurate price tags is unrealistic because so much variety exists, on top of customizable options and the use of seasonal ingredients. If you're looking for unique and authentic complex Chinese dishes, and don't care too much about price, this could be your spot! The quality of food and the variety are good - and they are an honest kitchen that will give you your money's worth. For a simple Chinese dinner meal, the prices are reasonable for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese dim sum ever. Very overpriced and doesn't taste good at all.  I'll stick with dragon boat."}
{"text":"This place is pretty hidden - it's a plaza with a few other Korean restaurants, and it looks pretty small and dingy from the outside, but it's like Narnia in there. It's huge, and it's pretty fancy, completely unexpected. Okay, Narnia might be a bit of a stretch. But I was definitely surprised when I came here for a small banquet. The food is delicious and well cooked, and the service is good as well. Everything was flavourful, without being over-sauced. I left feeling pretty thirsty though. I'd love to try their dim sum some day since the reviews on here are looking pretty positive!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the dim sum here. Salty AF so I think I asked for ten water refills, but still good. Too many deep fried and dough options and not enough steamed options! I also hate when they bring the dessert while you still haven't even gotten/received all the mains you ordered. Would return though!"}
{"text":"We love trying different dim sum places and heard  mixed reviews and decided to give it a shot.  Food lacked flavour however the staff were very efficient and place was super clean."}
{"text":"I would call Legend one of the better Dim Sum places in Toronto. Their dishes are all top-quality and they have a few options that I think are truly superior. In particular, their short ribs are among the best in the city!  While their prices are also a bit higher than normal, they are not so much higher that you wouldn't bother coming here. This is definitely one of my go-to places when I'm in the mood for above average Dim Sum and I'm not eating on a strict budget.  The more I think about it, this place really is one of my favourite Dim Sum places. I have a folder of pictures on my computer in which I keep \"best-of\" photos of food I've had and Legend has more pictures in that folder than any other restaurant. That should say something!"}
{"text":"I give it four stars overall because menu includes all my favorite dim sum dishes. Crispy octopus fingers were good. The only thing I would say is that some dishes were salty. A bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I've been coming to legend Chinese restaurant since my high school years which is a pretty long time. But as far as dimsum restaurants, this place is one of the more decent ones in town with moderate pricing and good selection. Unlike the traditional dimsum in China town, you pre-order on a sheet of paper so it might not be for those people who prefer to see the food before they order.  Also, this isn't the place for people who are looking for an early dimsum pre 11am discount as the pricing here is always the same.  The biggest benefit however is you won't have to wait extraordinarily long in line like at Paradise or Crown Prince.  All in all, great tasting dimsum, super clean and bright restaurant and quick service, at a fair price."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice in the past month, so the experience is pretty fresh in my mind.  I almost feel as though I was dining at a completely different restaurant than everyone else here.  I think the dishes are ok, but very forgettable and the flavours just aren't as developed as they could be.  We ordered a 3 dish dinner combo which includes a complimentary pork dish, soup and dessert.  The pork was on the fatty side. The other dishes we ordered were average, but not exceptional - a meatloaf, a fish hot-pot, and chicken with mushrooms/seafood.  I just found all the dishes to be very bland with very little creativity and imagination. This restaurant is not particularly cheap for what it delivers (it was $58 for 4 people not including tip), for the 3-dish combo.  This isn't a bad restaurant, but there are much better choices based on quality and/or price.  I notice that this is a popular choice when Chinese ppl are entertaining guests (i.e people who aren't chinese), so this might be a good idea - as the service is good, and the tables are spaced out nicely.    It's usually quite easy to get a table, as this is a large restaurant, and it is never full."}
{"text":"As I've often said, if you want good Dim Sum, you have to leave the city.  This place is the perfect example of that.    The Dim Sum here is probably the freshest, tastiest I've experienced in all of Torontonia.  You order your food, instead of having it delivered by cart. While I'm used to ordering via cart, this method is so MO BETTAH!  You're getting exactly what you want, and it's always fresh and piping hot.  No more yelling: \"WHERE IS MY SUI MAI BA PO!\""}
{"text":"The food is great, The only issue I can't get past is the SHARK FIN SOUP.  Cultural issues aside, the way this product is harvested makes it very difficult for our family to support establishments that support the Shark Finning industry.  Until thinks change, we will not be back."}
{"text":"This was my first authentic Chinese restaurant. I was so overwhelmed by it being authentic that my boyfriend ordered for us. We were served the beef & jelly fish, the pork & shrimp eggrolls, the chicken & pork dim sum, pork & shrimp puffs. Everything was fresh and piping hot. When I say piping hot, I mean it remained that way even as we ate, the temperature never dropped once! The puffs were good, however were sweeter than I expected. Given that, I used the chili paste and hot mustard to get it to the savory/hot flavor I expected. The shrimp & pork eggrolls... It's almost like I'd never had an egg roll before. It's full with meat and very little cabbage. The pork was so flavorful.   The only downside is the service: Your meal is served in a random order and communication/eye contact by your server is absent. If you can get over these things then your meal will be enjoyable. I'd definitely come again."}
{"text":"After deciding to experience something new ( over game of cheese), i can confirm it was a very unfortunate decision. Not only did my friend and i wait for over 40 minutes for our appetizer, but we did not end up receiving half of our order. The waiter, however, had the audacity to add it on to our bill. To top it off, we were the only two guests in the restaurant who were given plastic utensils and cups because the restaurant \"ran out\". Needless to say we will be skipping this place next time we visit the plaza."}
{"text":"After four years in Singapore, this is the most authentic Chinese restaurant I've ever been to so far in Toronto. The food is awesome if you like it on the Cantonese side and the prices are reasonable. The vegetables with bird's nest is a delight. The sizzling beef in X.O is a mind-blower. The fried rice with beef and the Chow Mein brought me back to my time in South Ease Asia. The spring rolls were decent and what I liked the least.  On the down side, because this place is so authentic, you might feel lost if you're not familiar with that type of cuisine and dishes. This is not your average Mandarin or even Asian Legend. There's just a simple English translation in the menu (no pictures) and the staff speaks English as a second language. We never had a problem, but some folks may have a culture shock. However, if you're willing to try the adventure, this is great Chinese cuisine for the price."}
{"text":"So I cam here for Mother's Day dinner with my family. I got here early and the parking situation is still acceptable. This has nothing to do with the venue, but rather the property management. Back to the restaurant. This place has been around for some time. The interior is typical Chinese restaurants, no modern renovations but just simplicity and pragmatic.   Food is okay, as we ordered a big family dinner for 10. However, I find the pacing of dishes came out uneven times: There were no banquets going on nor big parties aside from ours. Yet the timings were a bit off to be honest. Anyhow, food tasted okay. Can't really screw up a set dinner menu.   However, back to the venue. My party of 10 were stuffed into a small party room. So air ventilation was sub-par. So this can be an improvement on the owner's to improve air circulation. So my experience here was just \"OK\"."}
{"text":"Came here again recently for dinner on Mothers Day. Wasnt notified there was a special one page menu to order from as their regular decent priced menu wasnt available. Fine and all since it was a special day, however, after spending $230 for 5 people, the portions were so small we werent even full. Could haven gone to the Keg and spent less per person.  Still giving a two star rating as their regular menu is quite decent. Also they handed out a rose to all mothers which was sweet."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum here is really good, especially the BBQ Pork Pineapple bun, however their dim sum menu is small, and not a lot of selection, but what they do make, they do it good! This place is always PACKED with people at all time waiting for a table. I try my luck here and if it's busy, I go elsewhere, cause the lines can take awhile."}
{"text":"Prices updated  This is a convenient location for NorthYorkers to have dim sum if we don't feel like driving all the way to markham.   I found a piece of plastic in my food. But before that I was thoroughly enjoying my experience.   Also, their ??? is not what I expected. It's steamed.    It's an okay place for a dim sum craving if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Legend has it that... Hui yum cha, taun yut zhon leun geen.   Lai-Jing gay ho gor wo. See ha seen.  Markham, Richmond Hill, Scarborough. Those are built-in to my Dimsumming patterns. Probably same Mental GPS for other Chinese also. Reason?  Legend's simply not conveniently located.  Sui Mai has similar consistency of Steamed Beef Ball. Very Food Processor'd.  Good though and sizable. Decor, Food, Price combination considered, I'll fan Legend."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum I have ever had!   This is my third time here, unfortunately, they did not have any specials anymore, but I'm glad I came, because the dim sum is THAT great. Coming in at 9:30am, we thought that seats will be taken already, but we were one of the earliest ones there.   Prices are:  S- $2.90 SM- $3.50 M- $3.95 L - $4.95 XL-$5.75 SP- $6.99  Food: 11) Steamed Pork Wrapped Bean Curd in Soup Delicious rolls. The bean curd was soft and soaked with delicious soup. There were three rolls in here, a little smaller in size than other dim sum restaurants, but definitely great quality. I think I tasted a piece of pork skin in there as well.  15) Steamed Sticky Rice Wrapped in Lotus Leaf There were two medium to small sized sticky rices in here. I thought this dish was sort of average, but I didn't think it was very fattening, which is a bonus.   18) Steam Shrimp Dumpling with Coriander and Chives This was delicious. I can't believe the chef BLENDED the coriander and mixed it as the skin of the dumpling, making the colour of the dumpling green. The skin was not think and the filling was fairly full with DELICIOUS shrimps. This didn't taste very oily either.   28) Steamed Vegetarian Rice Roll This was delicious as well, I loved the greens that were added. They were young greens, not hard to chew. I do wish that the soya sauce was warmed up before this is served though.   34) Baked Chicken Pie with Portuguese Sauce MY FAVOURITE dish. The chicken pie was delicious, not overbaked with cute fork lines on the top. The filling was my favourite park. This was FILLED with scrumptious and savoury Chinese styled Portuguese sauce. I was so surprised because the chicken pie wasn't very thick and yet this pie did not leak any sauce out.  36) Deep Fried Pork Mashed Taro Puff This was another one of their stuffed fillings. Absoloutely delighted to see fillings that are stuffed. It wasn't too oily, the taste is not too sweet or salty either, one of the more average dishes.   Heard that this place is owned by the TVB star, Aimee Chan (???)."}
{"text":"Good quality and wide variety. One of the better dim sum places. Can come late into the afternoon and they would still have a wide variety. Good service and very clean."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed. Perhaps I didn't do enough research. Came because grandpa wanted dim sum, and this was the only legit dim sum place I could find between here and Bayview Village other than Pearl, but Pearl's fairly expensive, so I was thinking that this one would probably be better.   Honestly, the food here is just standard. Their Chiu Chow style rice soup with minced pork and oysters ($9.49) had a bit of a funky garbage taste (not necessarily in a disgusting way, but in an 'acquired taste' way). The phoenix claw wasn't quite as savory/sweet/flavorful as I would have liked. Some of the portions looked like Legend Chinese Restaurant cheaped out.   The prices didn't match (quite expensive). Their small is $2.90/$2.95 (I can't remember), but there's only 2 items on their menu that are size small. Most of them are medium ($3.90/$3.95?) and up. They have lunch \"specials\", but those aren't cheap either. They've got a bunch of noodle/rice dishes that are in the $14-$16 price range. At Congee Queen, their equivalents (and I have no doubt Congee Queen does them better) are in the $10-$12 range.  Tea charge is $1.20/person. My mother and I were charged hot water. Grandpa was the only one that had tea. If I had asked for iced water, I have no doubt I'd still be charged tea money.   Oh. They also miscalculated our bill. My phoenix talon was the last thing to arrive at our table, and we had to chase it down. We were told they had probably forgotten about it, but that they'd check on it. When we got our bill, they had charged us for two plates of phoenix talon instead of one. Simple mistake, but also a tad irking, as it wasn't the only mistake they made with that particular item.  I have no intentions of coming back. As much as I hesitate to go to Pearl, the price difference between that and here is not very big, and the food/service/ambiance there is better."}
{"text":"My family comes here all the time.  They offer consistently fresh food and cooked with some amazing talent.  It's so strange that they aren't busy, more often.  But that is good for us, since we never have to wait for a table.  I was most impressed with the vegetarian assortment here.  My sister-in-law, her mother is buddhist and doesn't eat meat.  So had a 10 course chinese meal, all vegetarian and it was AMAZING.  If you haven't had Chinese food in vegetarian way, here is the place to try it.  They use everything from mock duck, to fried tofus' - you'll forget there is no meat on the table!!!  Highly recommed this place but don't go too often - I don't want it packed."}
{"text":"My second time at a dim sum place and I quite enjoyed it.  It wasn't however fantastic.  I would still like to try more dim sum but I've had better asian food.  Go for dim sum and not speciality or plate foods.  The soya rice noodles and deep fried octopus were underwhelming. The shrimp dishes were better.  Food: 3/5, quite a bit of collection and they all tasted fine  Service: 3/5, just ok. Kind of slow for asian food.  Ambience: 3/5, not bad either, nice and wide restaurant with large round tables.  Price: 2/5, I thought it was a bit pricy for asian food, at around $20+ per person."}
{"text":"Some of the best dim sum I've had in the GTA yet! Everything was magically delicious. No old ladies pushing carts of soggy, greasy dumplings here; instead, everything is made to order so it arrives superfresh and pipinghot (Yes, I realize that \"super fresh\" and \"piping hot\" are actually four separate words, but the food at Legend was so good they make me run my words together.)   I ate so much that a wheelbarrow had to be called in order to get me back to my car. Once reaching the car, I split open like an overcooked sausage. Poof. That's how good the dim sum is."}
{"text":"A solid 3 star joint. Dim sum only visits.  I've been here twice with my boyfriend for dim sum brunch. I'm unaware of any morning specials before 11am like some places do.   I find the restaurant to have decent quality service. They're attentive and are generally customer service oriented. When you ask for extra sauce or napkins, they return in a few minutes with it.   They have a good variety of your classic dim sum dishes - har gow, siu mai, cheung fun, as well as the deep fried things... they don't however, have squid tentacles or speciality buns. If you're looking for the standard fare of dim sum dishes this is your place. They do have egg tarts and turnip cake :D 1.20 for tea, Dishes range in price from 3.20 - 6.20 for the speciality ones.   May try a new place next time as I find their prices aren't worth the quality-value you can get elsewhere. We come here as it's closer, on the more west side of North York and on the way to my part time."}
{"text":"The food itself was really tasty too, the brocolli dish was the best dish in my opinion out of the 3 that we ordered ($8.99). It came with a generous portion of shrimp and the tofu was fried really well. I'll definitely visit again thx"}
{"text":"Legend Chinese Restaurant has always been the go to dim sum restaurant for my family. The food is always delicious and the servers and hosts are all very accommodating. The prices are a bit steep though but that's only because of the quality of food that they serve to their customers."}
{"text":"Service: super slow and bad attitude. There were lots of free table around the restaurant but no one to clean it up for the next round. Seems like they were all not willing to work.   Food: mediocre! I can get that in most all Chinese dim sum restaurants nowadays in the GTA  Honestly, not a place I would return again."}
{"text":"Be aware that this place will put additional charges on your bill and I will never return because of the shadiness of the charges.    1.  They charged me for 2 teas that we specifically declined when we were seated. It was removed off the bill when asked about it.  2.  Cover charge was charged as well.  When questioned, the person behind the counter could not explain what it was.  So he asked his colleague, and she paused for a bit and said it was for sauces.  Seriously, you lost a customer for adding an erroneous $4 on a $60 bill.   Dumb."}
{"text":"I would like to give a negative star if I can. First time came to Toronto, went to the restaurant on a Wednesday afternoon around 1:30. Not many people. Wait for 40 minutes and nothing came to the table. We asked the waiter and the management came and told us that they could not find our order. He didn't even apologize, nor did the waiter. We left the restaurant. Super disappointment. Will never come to this restaurant. Will never recommend to any friends."}
{"text":"I have been going to Legend probably since I was in a high chair - the first place my brothers and I learned how to use chopsticks. Almost every Sunday my family and I would wake up, excited to go for dim sum at Legend and were never disappointed! The dim sum there is honestly out of this world. It's always so fresh and flavorful that no place else I have been even compares! My husband and I are big dim sum fans and have enjoyed this cuisine every place we've ever traveled to (including Asia) but Legend in our eyes is still by far, the best there is - worldwide! We now live in downtown Toronto and still drive the 45 minutes north to our favorite restaurant! From one dim sum fanatic to another; Legend will NOT disappoint!"}
{"text":"no tax before 11am if paying in cash.  food is good and service is fast.  they really stuff the rice noodle rolls with a lot of meat."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner  Specialty: Chinese Menu items: Cantonese Chow Mein, Sweet and Sour Pork with Pineapple and Fried Rice Noodles with Beef and Black Bean Sauce  You would never think that of all Chinese restaurants in the city of Toronto, including china town, Foodies Inc. would end up adding to its roster of best in town, a Chinese restaurant located in Richmond Hill. Well I did not think that either, but here we are.  Legend is to me a hidden Chinese gem. Located on Yonge Street just a few blocks north of Steels avenue, Legend gives us a taste of what the true motherland offers. Minus the 15 hr travel time of course.  Without much hesitation, and with a big appetite, we start our ritual of ordering by numbers. Legend's authenticity relies as much on the food as it does on the restaurant culture. Round tables, tons of Chinese families and well, Chinese waiters, with most of them speaking little to no English, make it all part of the experience. Hence why we ordered by the number of the dish on the menu, not the name of the dish. Its easier this way.   Number 25. Cantonese Chow Mein  This is always my favourite at Legend. Its crispy fried noodles with Chinese broccoli (Bok Choy), slices of thin chicken breast and some rather gelatin-like sauce. The crispiness of the noodles combined with the softness of the sauce is what makes this dish a hit. Simple, tasty and crunchy.   Number 14. Sweet and Sour Pork  By the time I was able to stop my friends from devouring the pork, the dish had already been assaulted. I have to give them credit though, they are always so patient with me as I have to take a pic of the food before they start eating it. I can't ask them to always remember my blog needs, they do enough already by accompanying me to my crazy restaurant selections, even if it means traveling miles from the city. Thanks guys! So here you have it, Sweet and Sour Pork with Pineapple. These are pieces of pork that have been battered and fried, then mixed in with its sweet and sour delight along with slices of pineapple and red and green peppers. Once again, simple, crunchy and tasty.  Do you see the underlying theme here?  Number 28. Fried Rice Noodles with Beef and Black Bean Sauce  They are flat rice noodles topped with slices of beef, onion, garlic and peppers covered in a black bean sauce. Another one of my favourites and certainly a must have from their menu.  Aside from its variety and well served dishes, Legend is a restaurant that suits any lifestyle as it is quite affordable. I would say no more than $17.00/ea, all in.  Until next time Foodies. Viviana."}
{"text":"The \"legendary\" Legend Restaurant was a huge disappointment. We ordered their \"legendary\" fried chicken and Pearl chicken together with our Chinese New Year feast with our friends. First, they ran out of the appetizer and asked if we can do without it. For a longstanding restaurant in the Chinese community, this is sub-par service and unprofessional.   Next their server mixed up the dishes and by error, served us a veggie dish.  To our dismay, when they realized that they served the wrong dish, they asked if they can charge us for the dish for their error. When we were all in awe for their ask, they decided to take the half eaten dish away.   The service is lousy, unprofessional and I will not recommend to try this restaurant.   The lobster dish was also a disappointment, the meat was mushy and not fresh.  The rice wrapped in lotus leaf was too bland. There was a slight aroma of lotus leaf but that was it.  We were expecting more from this restaurant but it was a true disappointment to the twelve of us."}
{"text":"This is one restaurant that my dad's side of the family goes to a lot, particularly because my dad's sister only eats at this restaurant, and no place else. She's a really picky eater and thinks that a lot of the Chinese restaurants in Toronto are really greasy and oily.  The seafood dishes are really good, especially the Suk Mai Ban Faai, which is a fish dish mixed with a corn sauce. Another dish I liked was the Si Jap Jing Sang Hou, which are these oysters covered in a black bean-like sauce. The oysters were so big and thick when I ate over there, it was probably the biggest oyster that I have eaten. The Cantonese style lobsters were okay.   As for the simpler, non seafood dishes, I thought the Choy Sum Ngau Youk and the Zha Ji Gai were pretty good, they were nothing too special, but I think the seafood was a lot better.   The restaurant is kind of a distant drive, but it's in a great location if you live in Thornhill or the northern parts of North York in the Greater Toronto Area. I would come back to this restaurant again if I am in Thornhill, but if I am living in another area such as Markham, Scarborough, or Downtown Toronto, I do not think it is worth the drive unless my relatives are going to be eating there. Anyway, it's still a pretty good restaurant."}
{"text":"They really save on labor here.  Patrons fill out a sheet for what items they want and the food gets delivered rather than having dim sum ladies walk around  and push trucks. The foods dont look like mass produced  items  in factories. MSG free!  We ordered all the traditional dim sum menu items, and more! We got shrimp ball, siu mai, steamed pork, cow belly, egg rolls, crispy shrimp rolls, shrimp and beef rice noodle wraps, grilled beef, eggplants  stuffed with shrimp steamed chicken over rice.   For the eggplants stuffed with  shrimp, it usually comes with a platter which includes peppers. We asked to only get it with eggplant.  It was pretty good. The egg tarts here are amazing. Super  fluffy. I could eat 2 plates of it. Everything  else here was average, except for price.  Lots of parking outside.  I expected this place to be packed because my aunt spoke so highly of it. We called in for a reservation,  but at 10:30am, it was still empty. We ended up getting a huge table (for 12) on stage where the wedding hosts normally sit. It was hard to get the waiters' attention even from on stage  I can't imagine how much of a struggle  it must be being at a regular table."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to dimsum restaurant. My family literally went every single weekend. However, the chef must've changed recently because the dimsum tasted horrible. I thought maybe it was an off day so I went again and it was still just as bad.   Also, one of the servers came thisclose to hitting me on my face. If I didn't put my hand next to my cheek he would've hit me.  He was always really rude but this incident took the cake.  For example:  - Soup filled dumplings: Used to be their specialty, but now the wrap is extremely thick and doughy. It was inedible  - Rice Noodle Roll with fillings: The sweet soya sauce they use is far too salty, first dimsum restaurant that doesn't use the proper sauce  - Beef ball: bland.. which was suprising. How can you get minced beef with water chestnuts watercress, mix them and make it bland?!  Honestly, I would much rather go to Pearl Bayview than here."}
{"text":"I would say the best thing they offer is service and a convenient location. They were quite busy for lunch, however, still managed to uphold basic service requirements many Asian restaurants lack (I.e, said thank you, smiled!) and were quick to provide you asked for.  The food itself was decent. It's not a cart dim sum so I presume it comes out fresh. I liked the sticky rice and the soup - everything else was just ok,  but dim sum is pretty objective and so everyone will have their own preferences and experiences.  I didn't realize until I read some comments here that they charge for tea. I checked my bill afterwards and realized they do in fact charge you. I was not told about this when they asked- \"water or tea\", so I'm pretty annoyed about the extra charge."}
{"text":"Legend Chinese restaurant ranks among the top dim sum restaurants in the GTA for me. My family and I celebrated father's day there and were left feeling stuffed after gorging in the variety of dishes they had to offer. Of all the dim sum places, I love their egg tarts the best.   The wait for a 10-person table at 11 a.m. was also very manageable. The servers were quick to deliver what we needed."}
{"text":"Food was amazingly good and service was great. We arrived at 5:30 and the waiter told us that dim sum ended at 3:30. What a disappointment!! We will be back though to try it!!"}
{"text":"It's pretty overpriced in comparison to a few dim sum places I've been to. Quality is probably average in my opinion but that is probably because I'm used to eating dim sum in Scarborough.  Service is really good though, they cleared all the empty plates almost instantly and brought new plates to replace our used ones.   But when paying the bill the person said we didn't leave enough tip :/ it was 15%..."}
{"text":"Having a very poor experience with the way this restaurant does business right now. We are looking for a venue for a funeral reception according to Chinese tradition. After a verbal agreement on pricing and menu over the phone, a couple of family members showed up at the restaurant to close the deal. The general manager Raymond began to make excuses to change the menu and pricing. Unbelievable and unethical business practice."}
{"text":"As far as dim sum places go this one seems to be fairly middle of the road. It's a very solid bet if you're in the area and we had no complaints at all when we went.  The food is good. We ordered about 8 dishes (including the usual dim sum staples of various shrimp and pork dumplings), and while nothing stood out as truly amazing, they were all quite decent. The one dish I will recommend if you have a sweet tooth is the sesame balls. The outside has a nice sweet crunch and the inside has a more mellow, smooth paste. Eaten warm it's quite a treat. My friend and I each had one, and even though I was already pretty stuffed at that point, we split the last one too (it's best eaten when it's hot right? Anything else would just be irresponsible).  The service was also quite good. Everything was brought out to us extremely quickly and the staff were able to answer some of the questions we had. Enjoy your dim sum!"}
{"text":"Here for dinner last night based on Yelp! reviews and a craving for Chinese food.  Since we came for dinner, I can't speak to the dim sum menu.  The dinner menu (at least the English one we were given; not sure if there is another one in Chinese with different listings) was generally straightforward Cantonese food with a section of Szechuan dishes.    Wonton soup with shrimp had excellent shrimp wonton but suffered a bit from an overly salty and I believe somewhat glutamated broth (I have nothing against the use of glutamate as it is a naturally derived ingredient but those who are allergic should take note).  Egg rolls were excellent, with a very meaty pork and shrimp filling given texture by use of wood ears.  My companions had fried rice and a noodle dish (which the proprietor customized a bit by request) and both were great.   The best, however, was my order of crispy chicken, which was a superb rendition of this Cantonese banquet standard.  The meat was succulent and not rubbery and the skin crisp to the point of separating from the meet.  Also nicely seasoned and no breading or other westernized nonsense.  It was served with the usual shrimp chips (very fresh) and dipping salt and vinegar.  Thankfully, the head was removed.  I would like to try this place again for dim sum.  Service was helpful and considerate and we did not find them slow.  Atmosphere is pleasant but be aware this place is VERY brightly lit.  Not a place for a romantic tete-a-tete or to take a mistress if you are cheating on your wife!"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum with my brother and his girlfriend on a Saturday morning. Right around 9.15-9.30 am, we were the first customers. However, by 9.45 the restaurant was packed! Would definitely suggest going early to avoid the rush.  The food was good, like you'd find at any Chinese restaurant. There wasn't anything overly special about it, but it was good quality. Very spacious, and the service was good too. We got the egg tarts for dessert - light and not overly sweet, I would suggest trying it.  If you're going earlier (I believe they said before 11 or 12), be sure to bring cash! You get a discount (:"}
{"text":"This place is pretty popular for dim sum, and they are pretty good - since there isn't as many options for dim sum in that area in particular, but overall this place is ok.  I just wish the dim sum quality is more consistent, because on some days it really is quite good and on other visits,... they are not very good at all.  The service is decent and is what I expect for a large format Chinese place that offers banquet style dining.   Once again their specialization is Cantonese-style (Hong Kong-style) cooking.   Skip the XO fried turnip cakes, I keep getting suckered into ordering them, and every single time after the dish arrives - I get that light bulb moment of \"oh crap, I forgot this dish wasn't one of their strengths\"  Their XO steamed rice roll, along with their taro stuffed puffs are decent; also, their tofu fa is pretty good as well.   Overall, they would be a 3 star, but with the inconsistent food quality from the kitchen, Legend is a two star for me."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Dim sum, I agree, is one of the best I've had in terms of optimal value. However, I also ordered fried chicken noodle, which was a disappointment...the noodles had this water taste to it which was somewhat awkward.  Service was a hit and miss until we recognized one of the waiters who used to work at Paradise (one of my more frequented restaurants for a long time). He gave us 10% off, which was really nice of him considering I haven't seen him for 3 years now.  I'll come back if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum! Got the shiu mai, Har gow, fried turnip, lotus leaf rice, and steamed minced pork. The minced pork was a bit dry, but everything else was really good. The service was probably the best I've had in an Asian restaurant. Even when we were seated in the corner the server kept checking up on us. The only thing I didn't like was that the dishes didn't come all at once."}
{"text":"Legend for day time Dim Sum - is A-OK.  It didn't wow me and the group of friends I was with, but this place is far from terrible.  Why not, it does the job for a dim sum spot in the afternoon, during the week.  Great dim sum fix for anyone in the Yonge/Sheppard/Finch/Steeles area, saves from going to Scarborough, Markham, Downtown."}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum. Everything we ordered was meh especially for what we paid for. There's cheaper restaurants that tastes way better. We ordered things like ha gow, shrimp spring rolls, BBQ pork buns, sticky rice, dough fritter rice rolls etc. My favorite dimsum dish is the deep fried taro with minced meat inside and it did not taste good here at all. I found the taro to be very bland and dense. We even got charged $1.20 for WATER. It wasn't even bottled, pretty sure it was tap. So regardless if you order tea or water, you're going to have to pay. Sigh not coming back."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would! Firstly, food was acceptable at best. Secondly, we were charged for 3 teas we didn't have. But seriously when we saw the charge for COVERING CHARGE, we were bewildered! Asked what it was and we were told it was for the table cloths. I didn't ask for a table cloth, how do you have the nerve to charge for it!?!?!   They almost got away with adding $7 of extra charges to the bill! Was absolutely disgusting!  Don't bother !!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. Dim Sum lunch that is a popular local pick in the area. Doesn't really stand out from alternatives. Reasonable prices with early dining discount."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that the dim sum here has been consistently the best I've had in the area for quite a while. Only bad thing I can say is that rice-wrapped steamed items are usually covered in a rice layer that's really too thick, but they don't fall apart unlike other places'. Service is quick and the food is always freshly made. Usually busy, and there can be a lineup during the weekend lunch dim sum rush despite the size of the dining room.  Offerings solely in Chinese on the back of the dim sum card are merely the noodle dishes on a separate menu on the tables. I definitely appreciate that forks are only ever offered if requested (or if one's ability to handle chopsticks visibly shows one requires a fork)."}
{"text":"I honestly couldn't find anything wrong with this place. I came here by myself for Dim Sum lunch (yes I'm super ok with eating solo).... And the service was FAST! The food was FRESH and HOT!!   I don't eat meat so all my dishes were shrimp ...and they were delish!!   I took down one star because it is quite pricey for dim sum..... I got 3 dishes for 30 bucks. I don't know why my shrimp dishes were considered XL....   Anyways. I will return."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night around 8:30PM and were seated promptly. There was just me and my parents and we ordered a family meal for 4 which consisted of soup, lobster, a tofu with broccoli and enoki mushroom dish and a fried fish dish which also had tofu and other vegetables. The total? a whopping $100 plus tax! Expensive but the food is good. They had ran out of small lobsters, and their substitution was half of a larger lobster but we had to pay an additional $7. I didn't understand that, but I didn't argue. One of the best lobster's I've ever eaten tho! It was tender, not tough or chewy and the sauce it was coated in, with garlic and whatever it was, was soooo sooo good and addicting. Highly recommend the lobster here. The rest of the dishes was delicious, I just think it is overly priced. Restaurant is clean and can get busy during dinner time. If you want to impress someone with good Chinese food, eat here. They give you complimentary dessert at the end of your meal too."}
{"text":"I am not sure but I do not think this is the same restaurant as Asian Legend. Asian Legend is a chain. This is not a chain restaurant. The Dimsum was better than in NYC as it is today since our China towns and Dimsum have gone down hill but not really as good as I have had in San Fransisco. The menu is more extensive than NY and less so than Yank Sing in San Fransisco. If it was in NYC I would probably give it  5 stars but since it is in Toronto I will give it 4 since I  have come to expect more from Toronto. However I will say this is better than any Dimsum in NYC! We had a mix of dishes that we ordered and tried a little bit of everything. It is slightly more expensive than the average Dimsum but worth it."}
{"text":"First time here, so I decided on giving them the litmus test for dim sum restaurants.  There are foods in every culture where you base the restaurant's worthiness upon first visits.  With dim sum places a good reference point would be as follows:  1. Har Gow - steamed shrimp dumpling.   - this one failed on the dumpling cover as it was tough and broke apart very easily upon manipulating with the chopsticks. Taste wise it was a little on the bland side but would rate 3/5.  2. Siu Mai - traditionally a steamed pork dumpling but in this case shrimp was added. - again a little bland and close to undercooked. Rating at 2/3.  3. Steamed sticky rice in lotus leaf.  I really hate to slay the dead horse but this was bland and uninspired.  Where is the flavour?  Rating 3/5.  The dining room is beautifully decorated, the washrooms are clean (rare for Chinese Restaurants), it is family oriented which is a plus for those with children, and a living hell for those who want to dine without kids using their dishes and chopsticks as a drum kit.  The service is also efficient.    Unfortunately, in a city so full of good competitors it would seem Legend only survives based upon their relative distance away from real competition. They simply need to bring in a good head chef.  Overall - 3/5"}
{"text":"Dim sum here is unshakably solid. My family are die-hards and have dim summed at the best of 'em all over the GTA and Legend delivers every time. Never a misstep in food or service. Dishes are always top quality, hot and fresh (not a toothless grannies with creaky cart in sight), minimal grease, superbly balanced flavours. Stylish premises are always spotless, yes, even the toilets (look ma, no funny smells!). Service is no nonsense, Hong Kong style efficient and invisible (all empty dishes whisked away before you can blink!). Kitchen gets orders out fast. Go when you're hungry!  Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Classic dim sum menu perfectly executed and all seafood (shrimp, squid, etc) were all top notch freshness. We loved the lunch special scallop & fish roe fried rice, and the veggie cheung fun (aka rice rolls...unique!)."}
{"text":"One thing that struck me about this place which stands out from any other dimsum joints is its service. A few of us came here and asked for a large table for 14 people, and although the restaurant was mostly full and all the big tables are already occupied (sunday early afternoon - peak dimsum time), they moved so quickly to move people around and put up a large table for us.   From here on, there's not much more to day. They have all the dimsum food and they all arrived without any issues. My favourite were the green chive dumplings. Definitely a great dimsum place for large family gatherings."}
{"text":"Legend was the first place I picked out purely based on Yelp reviews and I am happy to say you've done me proud Yelp! This is a great place to entertain a 4+ group. They have a wide variety of yummy dim sums and authentic Cantonese food for different palates.   My personal favourites were the Shrimp Scallop Congee, the Pan Fried Shrimp Bean Curd Sheet Roll and Vegetarian Dumplings.   Vegetarians and people with dietary restrictions should note that despite having quite a few vegetarian options, some dishes contain meat without stating it on the menu. For instance, the Lo mai gai or steamed rice wrapped in lotus leaf has pork but it does not say so on the menu. As nice as the wait staff is, most of them do not speak English, which makes ordering daunting for a novice like me."}
{"text":"Dim sum is fantastic, staff there has a good attitude as well. Better than the dim sum place at dragon city china town. I have dim sum here with my partner every weekend."}
{"text":"Thanks for Edwin A for organizing the UYE!!  It is hard to believe that I never been to Legend Chinese Restaurant until now.   Dim Sum always fun when going with a group... I almost want to check everything off the list!  \"I want to try this! I want that! You guys would love it!!\" I just want my dim sum!!  Everything we ordered taste great! Maybe because I have great companions?   All the usual dim sum were all done nicely here. I love the Baked Tapioca Pudding with Walnut the best.. since it was freshly prepared when ordered, so it took awhile to arrive...  BTW, this is the first time that I got so overloaded with Sui Mai and Deep Fried Taro!! Imagine 3 orders each for 5 people??"}
{"text":"Legend Chinese restaurant is a fantastic restaurant. I planned a reception dinner here from California and they were able to send me a menu that worked within my budget and provided a private dining experience for my family of 40 people. The service was really good and very professional with a server plating the family style meals to each individual.  The food was excellent and I received many compliments on how tasty and fresh everything tasted from the scallops to the Peking duck to the mango pudding, everything was exceptional! Thank you very much for making this dinner a success!!"}
{"text":"Since my husband brought me and the kids here on one of those lazy Sunday mornings, we kept coming back and brought guests for an enjoyable feast.  And today I'm making it an official personal landmark for fine Chinese dining.    A premium Chinese Dim Sum place, it's a fine blend of Ambassador Chinese Cuisine and Asian Legend in terms of ambiance - contemporary and cozy with a perceptible refinement & class.    What stands out even more, and perhaps incomparable to other dim cum places, is the impeccable fresh and flavourful food!  Generous serving, delectable meat and spices, and the awesome goodness of premium Chinese food that leaves a distinctive impression that its Legend's.    Everything on the menu is good and none have disappointed even my most discerning guests... and my in-laws!  :D  Orders are ala carte from a sheet of paper and marked as each item is delivered.  My personal favourites:  a)  The Beef Balls are probably the finest I ever tasted - juicy and \"sweet\" with nice hints of freshly chopped cilantro and herbs.   b)  The Pork & Shrimp Fried Puffs with sweet meat filling that truly hits the palate with much joy, and my kids' fave too.   c)  The Pork Siu Mai is distinguishable because its quite rare that the orange garnishing (yes, the roe) actually tasted like seafood.  d)  Anything that has shrimp in it is on my plate with its truly chunky and delicately cooked meat filling each cloud-like wrapping with savory treats.  And, they practically redefined my taste for  e)  Roasted Pork Bun with the nice hints of Chinese Five Spice (others might say its Cinnamon) from its ambrosial filling.  The place is big and spacious, with a couple of banquet halls.  Gets crowded and line-up would have built-up as early as 11:30am.  It would be pretty nice if you would come a little later so my big family of 5 can actually have a wonderful brunch on time at any given Sunday.  ;D  The crew is quite consistent with efficiency and cordiality.  I never experienced being rushed nor ignored, everything is done nicely and discerningly.  Is there any more need to sell you the idea that Legend Chinese Restaurant offers an absolutely wonderful dim sum dining experience?  For the benefit of some of you guys who can't help it, like me!, I attached a photo of today's receipt for a company of 8.  Chow down!"}
{"text":"Dinner was not good. Lobster was disappointing. The tables look nice."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, consider going during lunch time. They have amazing lunch time deals! The food here tasted really good, also the staff are friendly and are always around so you don't have to wait.  P.S. they don't really suggest good options so it's better to choose on your own or look into reviews/pictures and sometimes they have trouble understanding you."}
{"text":"We were here visiting from Alabama and found this place which was close to our hotel. We wanted dim sum and was hoping to have something close to authentic since we were no where near Chinatown area. The food was ok which I gave it a 3 star. I probably would've gave it a 5 start if the service was BETTER! I wasn't sure what was going on with our waiter that day but our plates and silverwares were just bouncing off the table as he was trying to set them up. Holy. Too bad I can't post the video that we captured."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday at 9am right when they open and it was empty. Even by the time we left about an hour later, there were plenty of open tables.  They give a 13% cash discount.  The omassa was probably my favorite dish here. The texture was perfect. It's pretty hard to get the texture right, and this was probably the best one I've ever had.  The shrimp rice roll was too chewy and not enjoyable. Don't get the turnip cake, it was very rubbery. The egg yolk bun was super hard on outside and the inside wasn't runny.  The other dishes were all very average. I wouldn't make a special trek to come back."}
{"text":"Good eats.  I have come to this restaurant only for dim sum and it's been great.  The food is good quality for your usual suspects:  haw gar, sui mai, tripe, BBQ bun, rice noodle rolls and more.  Food was fresh and delicious.  The wait staff was good - quick and our table was maintained with tea and finished dishes cleared immediately.  Good quality dim sum and looking forward to trying dinner here one day."}
{"text":"There are not many chinese restaurants in thornhill area. In terms of location, it has its advantage.   we went on a sunday evening around 5pm. It was very clean inside and had comfortable seats. There were only 2 tables with customers there when we got there, but most other tables had already been reserved. I noticed they have 6 small tables for 2-3 customers by the windows, those are nice as usually the chinese restaurants have mostly big tables.   We ordered the steamed tofu with meat on top, steamed chicken with veggies,  and steamed fish special.  All the dishes were good except the fish. I was a bit disappointed about the fish as I thought they supposed to be fresh live fish. I think perhaps they don't have enough customers turnover to ensure the seafood are fresh.   I highly recommend the tofu  and chicken dish as they were really good, but avoid the seafood."}
{"text":"Went there because of the high reviews. From the moment i walked in, the atmosphere and the service were not was i was expecting. Not a single smile, thank you, or your welcome. Now to mention the below mediocre overly priced food. Nothing special and nothing worth the price that they charge. If you are ever in the area 10 minutes south of this dump is a cheaper higher quality and more delicious Chinese food restaurant called Sea-Hi."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. I don't even really like dimsum, but I enjoyed my meal. They have some real experienced dimsum masters making the food and it is very obvious. So despite the fact that it's quite pricey for dimsum - I think it's worth it. Especially since I don't have dimsum all that often.  Very high quality food that's very well made - the cheung fun (rice noodle rolls) are as silky as any I had in Vancouver and Hong Kong, and the stir-fried ho fun was actually separated before it was stir-fried! I've never had pre-separated ho fun anywhere before except at home when my mom and grandma made it. They also serve their chicken feet whole, which my mom and grandma noted doesn't happen in most places - they usually cut them in a few pieces these days. To have 4 whole chicken feet in one dimsum for like $5? Not bad at all.  The service was also very good - this is a relationship business, and it's not surprising, because they've been around for so long. The service was much better than many dimsum places in Toronto. They didn't bat an eye when we requested to switch one of our choices.  My only gripe is that 70% of the menu is \"fancy dimsum\" - there are a lot of staple dimsum items that I like that are more humble that they don't offer here, because they obviously position themselves as a more upscale place. It's too bad, because I'd love to get some Malay cake etc.!  Overall - expensive, worth it, and I'd return. I'd especially like to return for a dinner, to try out their chefs' chops!"}
{"text":"Fast seating Sunday at 1.30pm.   Had our usual favorites  of har gao, Siu MEI, steamed sticky rice n chicken in leaf, chicken feet, deep fried taro ball, rice rolls with shrimp and bbq pork and yee-fu noodles.   Great taste, portioning and speed of service.  Tea refills were fast."}
{"text":"Over two decades of living on the Hills (Richmond and Thornhill), you can't have driven past the slope near Clark Street without seeing Legend Chinese Restaurant.  I remember the days when it was one of the lonely restaurants in the area with Red Lobster to the south and Hy&Zels to the north.  Legend has stood the test of time as many new Korean restaurants have popped up all around it.  Located on Glen Cameron, the mall it occupies has become a popular location for all the is Korean Food.  Home of Hot Taste, Gals/Gonoe Sushi, Piggy Piggy, PAT Korean Supermarket...and neighbours plenty of other strip malls with other Korean favourites.  Gone are the days to find easy parking, as the very large yard needs to also accommodate one of the last Red Lobsters, and a busy Nina's.  During Dim Sum hours, it's been a challenge.  I use to go to Legend a lot for Chinese Cuisine.  The place expanded years ago to occupy even more units of the mall making it very large and easy to find a seat at most dining times.  Even on a Saturday afternoon at 11:45AM, I was able to score a table for 4.  Unheard of in Markham!  And...that's probably the reason why this once packed restaurant doesn't seem to be as it once was.  Over the past decade, more and more Chinese restaurants have opened in Markham and Richmond Hill, offering more fusion and modern cuisine.  Also with stiff competition in those area, the prices became aggressive.  The aptly named Legend, holds fast to the traditional offerings and traditional service.  When my family wants Dim Sum, we end up at Legend.  We don't want the 45+ minute wait at Dragon Boat or the like, nor do we want the one price fits all size purveyors of junk.  Legend provides a solid food offering, albeit, a little pricier than their brothers in Markham.  They still do a decent amount of business with the staff that I've gotten to know.  Standard food for lunch is Dim Sum and their lunch specials.  We order the ubiquitous HawGow, Curry Squid, Beef Balls, ChunFun...other dumplings.  We also order their fixed lunch specials.  Kids don't seem to like Dim Sum all the much.  For a nominal fee, they get a huge helping of soup, proteins over rice, and a spring roll.  All in all, a good meal was had by all.  Legen...what for it...dary!  Cheers."}
