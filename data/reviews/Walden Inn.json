{"text":"World Class Spa -- hands down.  Having been to many, I've never seen one that gives you your own private twelve head steam shower and an over sized Jacuzzi soaking tub in the very room in which your treatments take place.  The accommodation, a loft room, although well above average, was too rustic to justify the price point.  This fact is easily forgotten when you consider how having a room on property enhances the Spa experience that's just a simple walk down the hall in the luxurious robe and slippers they provide.  At every turn your provided champagne and chocolates, hot tea and fruit -- whatever sensory pleasure they could think of to make your journey to relaxation sublime.  Outstanding."}
{"text":"Amazing place to host any type of event - corporate meeting or retreat, wedding, reception or dinner. Also top spa in America and number ONE in Ohio. Great atmosphere to relax and escape for a little while! 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is not the best hotel we've stayed in but it will not make it any less special for us. We'be been  staying in walden every year for the last 5 years for our anniversary. We do couples massage then check into our room, have an afternoon tea and then dinner at the barn (5star just there) then back to the hotel.
In the morning breakfast at blue ribbon coffee and then one more spa service. The overall experience is fantastic. After one night we feel completely refreshed. Everything is very professional and personalized to make you feel very special. Best service. Who would believe 5 star experience in our Cleveland.
We will be coming back every year"}
{"text":"Hands down the finest spa in Northern Ohio.  The accomodations, specialists and setting are world class."}
{"text":"First class Inn. My wife & I had a weekend package for our 10th Anniversary. They provided flowers and a complimentary bottle of Champagne to our suite. 
Restaurant had very good food. Only downside is the restaurant is off property, a 5 minute complimentary drive down the road in a rustic converted barn."}
