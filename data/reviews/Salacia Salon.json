{"text":"I love this salon and cannot say enough good things!!! I have been there four or five times already since it opened and every experience has been great! Kristina is amazing! She is super nice and very knowledgeable. She is always up to date with trends and constantly learning and perfecting her craft. What I can truly appreciate is that she is able to use the products that she loves and know work! Before I would go to a couple unnamed big box salons that only use specific products and unfortunately they would never stay in my hair and would come out so quickly even after listening to and following the care instructions. When I have my hair done by Kristina with the high quality products she uses my hair color always hold up well with proper care! Thank you for the great haircut and color! I love it!"}
{"text":"Kristina is amaaaaaazing! She's balayaged my hair and did some layers for me and I absolutely loved it both times. She's really fun and always recommends hair products to get my hair as healthy as I want it to be! She even checks up on me to make sure I'm using my olaplex ;) long story short she's awesome and you won't regret going to her!:) thanks for everything Kristina!!"}
{"text":"Went to Kristina to fix what another stylist did. She has a great personality and she really listens and has a discussion about what her clients want. I am so happy I tried her after she was recommended to me. I will definitely be back. :)"}
