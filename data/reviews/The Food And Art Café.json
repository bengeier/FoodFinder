{"text":"This place has won my heart for best breakfast in Whitby. My husband and I practically licked our plates clean! Great value, enthusiastic and friendly service - you can't go wrong. The scones are melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Lots of veggie-friendly options as well, including vegan waffles and pancakes."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, staff were so friendly!! The scones and the homemade jam were a favourite! Parking is street parking or paid parking, which is a downside but everything about the restaurant was great! :)"}
{"text":"Read all the good reviews before coming to this place for brunch. Where we were here for 45 mins after ordering the food. Letting the pregnant woman to wait for the food for more than 45 mins had already reached my limit of waiting. In addition, they lost our orders and came back with a plate of greasy over cooked home fries for apology. I don't want to take it too personal. But I do think this restaurant has the potential to do better. But first train your front line staffs. They should be more detail oriented when handling different customers on a daily basis."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my new favourite breakfast place in Whitby! The service was great and the food was fantastic!

I had the Pumpkin Bread French Toast and Chai Masala - both were outstanding! The chai masala was authentic and the French toast was so delicious and most, it didn't even need maple syrup. My husband had the big fart breakfast which included bacon, sausage, three eggs, the most crispy and delicious home fries as well as a homemade scone with blueberry compote."}
{"text":"After spending 20 years looking for the elusive brunch in Toronto, I've found it here. 

I had the benny. It made my day when I saw it was on a biscuit. It was amazing. The potatoes are even better. But they don't even come close to how good the biscuits and homemade jams are. 

The owners artwork is incredible.

Some may say they are a little over the top friendly, but I found it contagious. 

After burst pipes in the morning, I was in a terrible mood. After 2 bites, the food improved my mood."}
{"text":"Such a pleasant little cafe in the heart of Whitby. Pheobe was the most energetic and lovely hostess. The ambiance is eccentric and beautiful, the service attentive and cheerful. They even expedited my toddler's meal when he was getting a bit hangry.  

The food was great. I had the veggie bennidict served on a light and buttery scone with rich hollandaise sauce and some magical homefries. My Husband was ecstatic to find Chicken Adobo on the menu, both were delicious. Other members of our party ordered egg dishes and all were happy & satisfied. 

My mother was so obsessed with the scones she ordered some to go. The only disappointing part is that we're not from Whitby and will only be able to enjoy this gem when visiting my folks. 

Prices are super reasonable and and everyone is lovely, just trust me and go."}
{"text":"What an amazing little find! This is a unique restaurant with a lot of character and a wonderful story, not to mention fabulous food. 

My husband and I went there for brunch. I had the bene and my husband had the breakfast crepe, both were delicious! The scones are melt in your mouth goodness and the preserves were also made in house and available for purchase."}
{"text":"I came to FART wondering what was going on. Turns out it's owned and run by a lovely family. Super good food, quick friendly service and good coffee.  Amazing local paintings hung up on display and for sale. Home made scones and jam. Support the locals rather than the big faceless coffee chain that cuts benefits to its workers.  Oh and cookie bites that came with our bill.  Our server is the daughter of the owners, and she's awesome.  :)"}
{"text":"Good spot for breakfast. Friendly atmosphere. Priced right. They have a good spread for everyone and I'd say one of the best spots in Whitby in 2018. Mother, daughter and Dad:)... they are local and it's great to support them. Don't waste your time with sunset grill or should I say sunset grillbage!."}
{"text":"I came here one morning for breakfast with my boyfriend. The daughter (and waitress) was a walking day of sunshine. There were at least 7 other full tables at the moment, and she still made sure to come check on us frequently and in a timely matter.

The atmosphere is great. We're both graphic design students and we obviously love art, so we felt right at home. It was very cozy and warm; plus, we had the chance to colour in some amazing colouring pages on our downtime. LOVED IT. 

I ordered the trio of scones and 3 fresh fruit preserves, as well as a coffee, and I literally could have shed a tear over how beautiful the taste of those scones were in my mouth. It was like eating pure happiness.

My boyfriend ordered a sandwich and a \"special\" coffee and he told me in confidence that it was the best sandwich he has ever had in his 20 years of existence. He also rated the home fries as the 2nd best fries he's ever had (I snagged a few and can confirm that they were perfect in every way).

All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our brunch there and will definitely be back again soon."}
