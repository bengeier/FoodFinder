{"text":"Guys, hands down the GREATEST wings I've EVER had. Crispy, fast, fresh, and just delicious. Love the owner. You are making a mistake if you don't come here when you go to Tempe. The AZ seasoning is out of this world, and if you want hot, the AZ spicey will live on in my dreams. The blue cheese dip is actual blue cheese, not that fake stuff, and the biscuits..... speechless. Ohh, and they have a kool-aid dispenser. The most crispy wings I've EVER had, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I been going to this place since they open. I wish they didn't take the catfish off the menu because it was really good. Their wings are still really good."}
{"text":"Good place a little expensive but that's because it's not a chain. Support local businesses."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location multiple times since they were called \"ATL Wings\" . The quality of the wings is spot on delicious! The fries is tasty as well. If you're planning to order the fries, be prepared for a huge serving of fries. AZ Wings is located within the shopping plaza so there is plenty of parking. My only poor experience was the cleanliness and smell  inside the restaurant. The floors are terribly sticky. Every time I walked it felt as if I had gum stuck on the bottom of my shoe. The restaurant had a damp smell of mustiness possibly from the AC unit. Overall, the food is great and I would order from AZ Wings again."}
{"text":"This place tried to murder me from the inside. I've never gotten as sick as I got after eating this place. I think it was the fries, greasy, grease soaked, insanely greasy fries, because I ate the fries and my wife didn't, and she didn't get sick... The chicken was actually a bit tasty, but overpriced. It's like over a dollar per wing... the only reason I give them two stars instead of one is because they had Kool-Aid on tap. So maybe just get some Kool-Aid and get food from somewhere that serves mostly food instead of mostly grease."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see the name change but saw the menu was practically the same.  Very friendly customer service which is a pleasant change from ATL.  Wing flavors are the same and accurate but these wings are not as crispy-which is how I like my wings. Fries are those handcut ones that also aren't crispy.  Overall good wings but not as good as ATL"}
{"text":"AZ wings took the place of ATL, but they just know what they are doing here. Great chicken wings, awesome flavors, and they are always consistent with the product. The customer service is pretty fair for a fast food style place, but we come back consistently for the food! I honestly hope this place doesn't explode like ATL did because their product went down quickly. If you're looking for wings, look no further!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time since moving here to AZ 6mos ago and I have to say this place has the best wings and the female who took our order was awesome! Great service and food! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The wings were pretty good. Very quick and easy service. This was my first time visiting this place, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I really enjoyed the Cajun Hot wings. I was surprised by how fast the food was quick. The woman who took my order was super nice! She even let me try one of the flavors, just to be sure I liked it. I would highly recommend. The prices of these wings are very reasonable and you get so much for your money! Stop by. I will say this place is a little hard to find, but it's literally like right on the side of the Arco gas station. My GPS kept directing me to the Starbucks, but the restaurant is like around the building, on the corner. Overall, very good! Will come again."}
{"text":"Left Wing Right Wing Chicken Wing --Woody Guthrie  I hear ya Woody. There's perhaps nothing more unifying than sharing a great meal together, breaking bread with others. That's the only way I get along with my parents after all lol. So, I say why not ditch politics and ideological differences for a bit and split some good old fashioned chicken wings? If only some officials in our government could live by this motto!  The first time we tried their wings we got here a few minutes before closing and asked if they were still taking orders. They were nice enough for us to squeeze in the last order of the day. There are quite a lot of flavors available for both boneless and regular style wings. Sides include biscuits and fries. I've had both the boneless and traditional wings.  The boneless wings are more like nuggets, and are tender with a crispy outer coating. I like the traditional wings too, which also have a nice balance of light crispy outer portion with the meat. I've had both the AZ spicy dry rub and the Jamaican jerk seasoning. They aren't kidding when they call the AZ dry rub spicy! My mouth was on fire for a good half hour after eating the little inferno nuggets. I liked the jerk seasoning too. It had just the right amount of heat for me (About 3 or 4 out of 10) and I enjoyed the blend of spices they used.  As for sides, the seasoned fries are plentiful and I like how they aren't super salty. It allows more of the natural flavor of the potatoes and the spice mixture to shine. I really enjoy the biscuits as well, which taste more like a beignet than a traditional flaky biscuit. I've had them smothered with honey, powdered sugar and cinnamon. Oh so good!  The atmosphere here is bare bones and at my last visit the table I was eating on was a bit rickety but hey, it's a wing place not Binkley's.   Service is fast and friendly.  I'm already thinking about what I want to order next time, these are some tasty wings!"}
{"text":"Service was and is always incredible! We got here 5 minutes before close and it appeared they were ready to close up so we were apprehensive about coming in. They kindly waved us in and took our order!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, great flavor options, and reasonably priced. Clean and fresh smelling restroom.   Would come back!"}
{"text":"Food is well over priced honestly. Act like McDonald's when it comes to dipping sauce. Ordered a 24 piece and got 2 small things of ranch that lasted 7wings. Never wasting my money there again"}
{"text":"This place was previously called ATL Wings. Unsure why the name changed, but still the same great taste! I had to give 3 star though, bc it is very pricey and the cleanliness of the dining area could be better... why the floors are sticky? I wish I could tell you. When we arrived, no one was there. It was maybe 20 minutes after they opened yet the tables looked as they hadn't been cleaned and everywhere I walked I could here the ground sticking to my shoes. When our food arrived, everything tasted great! But for what we ordered, it sure didn't seem to fit the price of $45 to feed 2 adults and a 5-year old. Don't get me wrong, the food tasted great and everything came out as we ordered, but the cleanliness of the dining area and the price just threw me off..."}
{"text":"Despite your \"A\" posted on the window, this place has a loooooooong way to go before you get a dollar from me. The restaurant was not easy to find so it would have been helpful to have a sign that says more than just \"WINGS\". Walking into the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was the offensive odor. I'm not sure if the sewage is backed up or what the problem is but that odor is enough to kill any appetite. The floors were disgusting, as if dirty mop water was used, so my shoes were sticking to it.  The restaurant was practically empty but the staff still seemed to be in a bad mood.  No smiles, no greeting, no acknowledgment, whatsoever. The drink station was dirty.  After standing here for a few moments, I quickly realized that I'd need to rethink my dinner plans.  Overall, I came way out of my way just to be disappointed. Not to harp on the smell but to be a chicken restaurant, there was not even a hint of a chicken smell. Not fried, baked, broiled, saut√©ed, boiled, microwaved... no chicken smell, whatsoever. Lol"}
{"text":"Went in with my boyfriend, last Sunday, since ATL wings near our house closes early and this used to be an ATL wings. They have a new owner and according to him they have changed some of the food items however I cannot compare since this was my first time here. First off, I'm glad they were open later on a Sunday because it was 6pm and I was hungry!! Thon took care of us at the register. Music was good, place was clean and air conditioned well. They have points you can accumulate, which is great because my bf lovessssss wings!! Fries were probably the best fries I've ever had hands down! So crispy and hot. Ranch was amazing! I got the garlic and lemon pepper rub and they were bomb. Definitely recommend this place if you love wings like we do!"}
{"text":"Nice quiet little place. The flavor of their wings are delicious. My favorite flavor were the suicide, they also come nice and saucy compared to the hot ones. The suicides also taste peppery if you like that. The only thing I didn't like is that they were over fried. Besides that great establishment"}
