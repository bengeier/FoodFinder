{"text":"This place is a new mini-restaurant within the formerly Wasabi Grand Buffet. Wasabi was pretty dismal, so seeing them try to revamp the place and try a new business/model direction is something I applaud them with. 

The place's decor were pretty well done and comfortable, and really set the mood of a Japanese restaurant. I do think they did a really good job at this.

The menu is quite limited, entrees listed just 6 ramens, and 3 shabu shabu (mini hotpot). We tried the Miso Pork Tonkotsu ramen and the Chicken Tonkotsu shabu shabu. Food looked great but taste was disappointing. Pork was tough, noodles felt like instant noodle quality as another reviewer mentioned. Broth was subpar, portions were small, one slice of fishcake, one slice of pork, smaller than avg ramen bowl and missing the corn as well. The hotpot chicken was pre-cooked and tasteless (can we still call it hot pot?), veggies were decently fresh. But I noticed the fish balls were store bought, exactly the same type my mom buys from the supermarket, and that to me was a testament of their true food quality.

In all honesty, it was not a terrible meal, but for a new business model we just expected a much bigger effort in the food. On top of this, there is a 12% after tax - mandatory gratuity service fee imposed on all tables regardless of size. The standard is that service tips are charged on the food service, ie. pre-tax amount. The only reason I think they'd impose a mandatory service charge is if people historically didn't tip you much, which really says something. 

Looking at the receipt, it still says Wasabi at the top, so definitely still the same company. I cannot really explain the vibe of this restaurant, just a lot of things off about it. It tries to masquerade as a competitive modern restaurant, while being lazy and cheap with the actual food. You walk in, there are more employees than guests (aside from the Chako side), and you may even be graced with being able to walk into a completely empty dining room."}
{"text":"A new #ramen place opened up where Wasabi used to be in the #mississauga entertainment centrum (#courtneypark #cineplex):
#miso #tonkotsu #ramen - this is just a high quality #instantnoodle at best, can't be called an authentic ramen as the #noodle is comparable to the instant noodle u can make yourself at home (more like manufacturered noodle than freshly made). The pork is firm n hard, totally didn't expect that. The egg is almost cooked all the way thru. This place should be called a Chinese instant noodle bar instead.

Apparently this place charges 10% #gratuity on everyone's bill regardless how big the party is, got words that only 1% goes to servers, the rest go to the restaurant instead; if that's the case, screw the gratuity I ll only pay for the food n tax only, I ll give the tips in cash directly to the server myself...Will never return to this place, they r destined to fail w this kind of policy n mediocre food.

Rating: 1.5/5 - 1 goes to the food n the 0.5 was for the nice gesture of the server who gave out ice cream for everyone on the house (who can complain for freebie )

{"text":"Saw a video on BlogTo about Washoku which replaced the Wasabi buffet. Ichi Potto is one of the restaurants of the 4 in the building that focuses on Ramen. The interior of this restaurant looks really Japanese and fits the atmosphere well. I came on a Friday night with 8 people to try out this new place. There was a huge line up of people but it seems like they were all waiting to dine at Chako (KBBQ). Ichi Potto wasn't that busy, was pretty much empty.. which doesn't set a great impression for us but whatever. It's new, still wanted to try it. 

2/8 orders were messed up and the servers seemed a little confused but it wasn't their fault. Think it was the cooks that messed up because on paper, it was submitted correctly. Of the 2 ramen places I've tried in Mississauga, this is probably one of the better ones imo - though the company I was with was very disappointed in their bowl BUT they agree that it is by far better then Kenzo which says a lot anyways. 

Portions were average size and looks visually appealing. The \"spicy\" isn't a spicy soup base. It's the chilli flakes they put on top to make it \"spicy\". Wish the soup was spicy though.. The karaage doesn't look or taste like your typical Japanese style karaage. It's very similar to Bubble Republic's popcorn chicken and one of the ramen offers karaage instead of pork and that is given on the side. 

There are a few things listed in their appetizer menu and ranges $4-6. These restaurants are still new, so I think and I hope they're still working on their menu cause as of right now, the menus we got were just sheets of printed paper. 

I'd probably come back cause it's close to me and I like it more then the other places I've tried in sauga."}
