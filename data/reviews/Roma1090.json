{"text":"I'm so glad Roma's is open again. The look is so much better and the food is out of this world. The prices are fair and worth coming back again. Owners her take pride in their food and especially with their coffees. A must come back. 10 *****************."}
{"text":"Our first time at Roma; definitely won't be the last!  We had potato & leek soup, lasagne, rack of lamb and a margarita pizza. All delicious! Creme brûlée and cheesecake to follow. Great! And friendly and efficient service too. Hopefully the weather will allow the patio to be open soon as well."}
{"text":"My partner and I both ordered the Adriano calzone. I mostly went for this option because I love caramelized onions. However, it is very evident that the individual responsible for preparing my meal (note, I did not say chef) does not know that there is a difference between caramelized onions, and the sad, warm pieces of onion that littered the interior of my calzone. The other menu items might be better, but this was enough that I will probably never order from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The food was great! However, beware if using a Groupon. My boyfriend and I decided to order drinks just to be nice. We order $16 worth of wine and were then expected to pay $13 worth of HST which was calculated based on the entire price of our \"free\" meal. They also didn't serve us any free bread. The server was great though. Even though we were the only ones in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Giving it a 4 just doesn't seem fair. Pizza, spaghetti, grilled calamari, lasagna all of their items are great. The Nutella banana pizza is probably one of the best desserts in the area and the service is A1"}
{"text":"Redeemed a Groupon for a 3 course meal at Roma 1090. This location has a nice indoor space and outdoor patio. They cook their pizza in a wood fire oven. 

We had the Bruschetta to start and split the Fettuccine Contadina and Calabrese Pizza. For dessert we had the Chocolate and regular Cheesecake. Overall the food was fantastic, and we would definitely return for the pizza alone.  

The service at this location was excellent and our food arrived at the perfect pace to allow us to enjoy our dinner without feeling rushed."}
{"text":"Thought is was pretty good, nothing amazing, but not bad and fairly priced. Had Penne Arrabiata + ceasar salad"}
{"text":"We had dinner on the beautiful sun-dappled patio at Roma1090. It is was a great casual weeknight date. Our server was attentive and lovely.

The bread was warm, but not remarkable - a simple white loaf with little plastic tubs of butter. It is representative of a restaurant that is just fine overall, but nothing special. Little finishing touches would improve the experience - an interesting ciabatta or focaccia instead, a flavoured olive oil for dipping, garnishes on the entrees, or the offer of fresh cracked black pepper and parmesan. 

My $9 order of red sangria was a pleasant surprise, made well and filled all the way to the top of the stemless glass. The fettucine alfredo was perfectly adequate. The tortellini was excellent, with a flavourful cheese filling and a light cream sauce. Both dishes would have been improved by a touch more pepper. I would have liked to try the (house-made?) hot sauce that was brought to the table, but it was in a large glass bottle (the size of a water/wine bottle) and that made it too unwieldy to pour straight into my dish.   

For the price (most entrees $14-$20), the portion sizes were a little small. The quality of the food is good, but not quite fine dining. The portion sizes correspondingly are not quite small enough to order multiple courses, but not quite big enough to be hearty rustic Italian fare.  For two entrees and three drinks, it came to about $70 including tax and tip. That's reasonable, but there are better meals to be had in the neighbourhood and better Italian restaurants out there at the same price. 

There's something about Roma1090 that feels a little generic and not quite finished, but it has lots of potential."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is really close to being great, but needs to pay attention to the details.

When we walked in it smelt like awful, cheap cleaning supplies. Turns out they were burning dollar store scented candles at each table! I like ambiance, but why would you ever use scented candles right in front of food, and disgusting smelling candles at that.

At 6 PM for dinner the giant big screen TV was on playing CP24. Nothing I like more than news about beheadings and measles with my pasta and scented candles. I asked the server to turn it off and she did, but seemed confused. I could maybe understand if it was on a sports game or something, but even then, this isn't a sports bar. It is truly a huge tv in the back and I'm not sure what they're going for in terms of crowd. 

Food was pretty good. Bruchetta was decent, but weirdly presented with a paper napkin beneath it on the plate. Just that attention to detail would make it look like a better appetizer. Pizza was very good (though skip the sun dried tomatoes if you want actual sundried tomatoes), pasta was just alright. 

I think this place really needs to step up the wine list. I expected more offerings with an Italian resto.The winerack at the bar was about 80% empty- even if it just a decorative piece, add some props so it has some sign of life. 

We had creme brulee for desert and it was served in too large of a bowl, it was several inches deep. It clearly came straight from the fridge and the bottom half was too cold to enjoy- it didn't have the subtlety of different temps that you expect from creme brulee. It tasted like a vanilla pudding cup. 

All said, I enjoyed the pizza enough to return, or maybe do a takeout order. I think this could be a really cute date spot in the neighbourhood if they decided what to do with the TV (hopefully leave it off), maybe put on some music, ditch the scented candles and let the food do the talking."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really nice, and the food is excellent. The issue is the people who populate the bar section and the way the staff ignored what was going on. I arrived there tonight for dinner around 7 pm and was seated beside the door and 10 feet from the bar, which was packed. There were two people wearing sweatpants, a man and a woman, both drinking heavily. The man continually swore loudly (F Bombs every sentence) and threatened multiple times to punch the woman in the face, who then told him to F--- Off each time. He would get up from the bar and start shouting about the TTC, and about how nobody better talk bad about his Greek heritage. He was clearly drunk, yet somehow managed to receive three beers in the time I was there. 

My party ordered their food, and it came quickly. Our waitress, an Australian woman, was excellent. She was very friendly and the food was amazing; I had Veal Parmesan which I really enjoyed. Too bad I had to endure this domestic dispute going on right beside my table which involved comments like \"have you ever been molested on a bus?\". I've never heard such carry on in a restaurant before. 

The smell of the sickly sweet cleaning chemicals coming from the bathroom was off putting every time the basement door opened, which was frequently. Then, just as the drunk and his girlfriend were on their way out, an argument over the cost of a TTC fare broke out and the incoherent shouting began again. Finally after what seemed like an eternity they left and the meal was nice. The bar was quiet and I'm sure my fellow patrons were as happy as I was. 

Would I go back? I'd like to, but it would have to be much later in the evening. I just hope I don't encounter the drunk guy again, considering he shouted loudly \"I think I just found my favorite bar\" before he told his girlfriend he was off to hit on other women."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding! So is the quality of service! Very nice interior. And fair prices. Enjoyed this place a lot! 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Roma 1090 is right on the Bloor street, when we drive  to downtown we always passing by it. One day, we decided to stop have dinner there before go on to downtown for our show. We were greeted with a smile and the food was prompt and good. So, we decided next time we go to town, we will stop for dinner again. This time, the friendly waitress recognized us and treating us like old friends. So, this is our place to dine before going on to downtown for shows. 
Not only the friendly service attracted us, food is reasonably priced. One more plus here is that they are flexible. Because my husband's dietary restrictions, he asked garden salad with grilled chicken breast, which was not on the menu and which was promptly serviced without hesitation."}
{"text":"When I get a chance to order in I get excited knowing I'm going to be ordering from Roma1090. Everything is great, the pizza, the chicken parm is UNREAL and their homemade pastas are so tasty. I would live here if I could!"}
{"text":"Food is VERY flavorful. My toddler and I like the salmon and capers. But when we order through Foodora, we find the containers have leaked . Please look into more rigid containers."}
{"text":"Came here last night for mine and my fiancé 5th anniversary. We bought a groupon online  and we loved it. The only thing was that the portions are maybe a bit small. I had the steak and it was lovely but my fiancé had the lamb rack and it was 3 little pieces. I ended up giving him half my steak so that he wasn't hungry. Apart from that it was a very cute place and the drinks are very good prices."}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic.  The polenta worth writing home about and the eggplant parmiagana is also wonderful.  We're pescatarians, but, have not tried the fish.  Love the patio on a hot, sunny afternoon.  What's not to like!  We love this place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really nice at night. 
Seafood calzone - the breeding is really lightly fried and delicious, the filling was just okay.
Mussels - mussels themselves were nothing special but the SAUCE. And the bread they bring with it - SO good. 
Lasagna - meh. Cheese was rubbery, and the whole thing was kind of bland. Mostly drowned in tomato sauce for flavor. 

Server was really nice."}
{"text":"Came in here last night. It was rainy and cold out. Got the spaghetti and meatballs ($16) It was a huge portion, the meatballs were so yummy, the sauce was good and it was exactly the perfect thing for a cold night. If you get one of the salads make sure you get it to split with someone, unless you love salad, because it's huge. Warm buns come before your meal. The chianti was kinda sweet though so don't get that. 

The service was great. We had two servers attending to us. It was nicely lit (dim and romantic) and seemed both date night and family friendly. Will definitely come back for the patio in the summer to try their beer and pizza special ($18)."}
{"text":"I used a Groupon to dine here and the experience was just okay, nothing special. When I presented the Groupon to the waiter, he seemed fine with it but then I overheard him speaking with who I assume to be a part of management. She was a larger woman with highlights in her hair and said rather loudly \"I don't care for people who come with Groupons. The Groupons are more like advertisement for the restaurant and for cheap people.\" 

WOW. 

Not a nice thing to say at all and I will not be coming back here. The food was alright and dessert was subpar - would get better cake at the grocery store. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone who cares for good customer service."}
{"text":"Amazing food. We bought a Groupon for this place (appetizer, entrees, and desserts for two) and I enjoyed everything we ordered. The mozzarella just melts in your mouth. The only problem was that service was a bit slow but that was probably because it was right before Mother's Day and they had 2 huge parties. Other than that, the food is incredible."}
{"text":"I had a great valentines experience here, despite the high cost the food really reflects that well! Great food, great lightning, great vibe, and a great selection of wine.

Except for one thing, the first waitress was completely disrespectful towards me and my date. The first seating arrangement we were given was right in front of the cold door in the middle of the busy bar. When I requested to be moved to the numerous other tables the waitress gave us a smug look and asked us if \"we were sure\". Finally at our new table we waited a good 15-20 for her to serve us but we were flat out ignored and treated like second class customers. This women needs desperate retraining.

Finally we got the attention of this really awesome guy who accommodated us and took our order, he helped make the night memorable and saved this review!"}
{"text":"So Glad they are back. 

Pizza Roma, because \"Ristoranté Roma\" and then \"Draft Picks\" but now returns to the old school format as \"Roma1090\"
 The Seafood Panzarotti is the best ( though I noticed it has been a little light on the Seafood lately) That is their classic dish. California has the Veal Sandwiches, and Roma has the Panzarotti. This is one of the classic dishes of Italian Toronto.  Calamari, Mussels, Baby Shrimp, Scallops, all fried in a panzarotti. Nothing goes better than a Brio with this, and Pizza Roma ( Roma 1090) are perfect.  
 I miss the late night delivery they used to have, but when i got the pizza at midnight, the driver and i both joked about how \"5 AM was great 10 years ago, but we are both that much older now\" The Food Still Rocks, at Pizza Roma, I'm glad the original owners have the place back and are still cooking with the same amazing style.


Roma has been a bit hit or miss lately.  They sent me a \"seafood panzarotto with Salmon in it. WTF? Salmon? Then when i called to complain the girl tried to tell me \"sometimes we make them with Salmon\" like cheese tomato sauce and Salmon would somehow be edible, ever.  I've been eating these since the mid 80s and never did anyone ever put salmon in.  

Roma can be  great, but also can be awful. 

If you get something like that awful seafood panz someone put up a photo of, send it back.  They get it right the 2nd time.

And last night they dinged me for $18 for a mediocre seafood panz.  The Pizza was amazing, but $18 ( when it says $12 on the menu,and it was $14 three weeks ago.  I give up."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. Was here tonight for dinner around 10 PM and the food and service was amazing!! They close late on a Wednesday which makes it even better.

Ordered calamari, mussels in white wine sauce and veal parmigiana. 10/10 for food 10/10 for service. This will be the new spot since it's a 5 minute walk from home."}
{"text":"Had delivery from this place. Pepperoni, sausage, and prosciutto pizza came lukewarm. Crust was light and was probably the best part. Prosciutto was overkill. We also got an arriabata pasta that I feel like we could have made at home. Sauce was tangy but not spicy."}
{"text":"Roma 1090 is seriously good food. We had a seasonal pizza that was delicious and paired it with Chicken Parmigiano. The sauces of the chicken in marinara and the fettuccini Alfredo were simply devine mixed together. We added capers to give the mix a little tanginess. My mouth is signing the praises of Roma 1090. Bellisimo!"}
{"text":"I had such a bad experience , ordered a pizza , Ravioli & also steak . Ravioli was so dry and salty , the same with the steak , it was salty salty salty ....."}
{"text":"This is based on a delivery. The food is very average and I ordered the chicken parm and they placed the fettuccine Alfredo in the same container and all the sauces mixed. Also ordered the ravioli which tasted like chef Boyardee. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered here tonight for a cozy dinner at home with friends and family. They forgot 2 of my guests orders. We called back to rectify the situation immediately and were given no help from the woman on the phone. No offer of compensation or estimate for how long the remaining dishes will be. It has been almost 2 hours since our original order and over an hour since we called to ask for our 2 missing orders. Still nothing. We have made 2 calls to the restaurant and since they already have our money do not have faith that they will even return. In a city this big, with so many options, I do not see why anyone would bother with this mismanaged and unhelpful restaurant."}
{"text":"I was so sad when Roma's \"shut down\" and became Draft Picks. My friends and I would always go to Roma's because the prices were great and the food was even better! I'm glad to see her back in good form.

The decor is looking a lot better, simple yet the nice wooden tables and chair make the overall environment nice and cozy. Great to see they now have a stone oven as well- lots of great items on the menu are made in it.

My first time back, my friend and I split the calamari to start. It wasn't bad but it wasn't memorable. The sauce though was delicious! 

I ordered the Roma Calzone and she got the Chicken Pizza Wrap. BOTH were exceptional and just delicious. The Roma Calzone was very flavorful, the first bite you taste all the flavours and it wasn't greasy at all! Typically with calzones, you'll only taste dough and it will be overwhelming abundance of grease, NOT in this case. It was baked in the stone oven and perfectly stuffed. Loved every minute of it.

My friend let me try her chicken pizza wrap and it was also great! The concept of using fresh house made pizza dough to make the wrap really works well.

reminder: NO FREE REFILLS, we did not know that.

Our waitress was extremely friendly, attentive and made suggestions which is always a plus. We noticed though that towards the end of the service, her attitude completely changed. We weren't sure if something to do with us or something else that bothered her?  It was odd.

The second time I went back with my boyfriend for a date night. I got the steak and onion wrap (we ordered a side of fries) and he got the Roma calzone. I was surprised to see that my steak didn't come in a wrap but in a bun. I'm not sure if they ran out of pizza dough but nobody told me. Regardless though, the steak was tender, perfectly cooked and very flavourful so I didn't even complain. This time, the waitress (the same as last time) offered a spicy olive oil for the calzone which was great, it really brought out the flavours in it.

I had a great time but the washrooms downstairs really REALLY need to be renovated. It smells like mildew and the smells seems to be creeping into the restaurant. It's a shame because I love this place but I'll go back anyway and make a comment about it."}
{"text":"Tried their Margherita pizza and i must say that it was one of the best pizzas I've had! Loved the taste, juicy, fresh out of the oven, even though it was delivered. The mozzarella was stretchy and yum, there were a few cherry tomatoes as well, again adding to the juiciness, and basil for the flavours. I definitely recommend this place for their Margherita pizza, and will try out the other pizzas too next time!"}
