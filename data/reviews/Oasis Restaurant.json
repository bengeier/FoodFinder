{"text":"Reasonable prices, try the grilled pimento cheese and bacon sandwich! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Brought my extended family of six here for lunch. We all got hot dogs, some chips, drinks, and a little bit of dessert. 

I got out a $100 bill to pay for it all. I received $78.40 in change..(!)

Needless to say, the prices are most reasonable. Hot dogs are $1.65. And quite tasty! The only thing that was a bit of a miss were the weird 'B&G' apple pies. Oasis should just go with Hostess apple pies. 

But I definitely recommend this place to anybody looking for hot dogs or sandwiches in Monroe. 

Owner is quite friendly."}
{"text":"Maaaaaannnnn Oasis been my spot for years!! When I was a young bull I used to walk from Dickerson gym to get me a hotdog all the way, hold the onions.  The hotdogs be so flavorful. That I can't eat them nowhere else. This place is on point like a harpoon fam."}
{"text":"We visited Monroe for a funeral and asked at the church where we could get coffee. We were sent here. The counter staff told me that they were known for their \"dogs (hot dogs.) We both had Russian tea ( a tea doctored with sprinkled cinnamon and orange peel and I believe it is sweetened), a piece of sweet potato pie and a piece of rhubarb/apple pie. The pie is $1.80 a piece-an unbelievable deal. A large tea is $1.25. The locals come in droves for take outs. The service is counter and you take to a table to consume."}
{"text":"If you're ever in DT Monroe, you have to check out Oasis!  Old time soda shop style diner that's been around since 1933.  

I can't stress enough how good their hotdogs are!  They also have other diner classics like pimento cheese sandwich and chicken sandwiches.  

For dessert, they have great ice cream selections and homemade pies/cobblers.

Come prepared. Cash Only."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!!! Basic, inexpensive delicious sandwiches and pies. We had the Chicken Salad sandwich and the Pimento cheese sandwich and a piece of fruits of the forest pie. Delicious!!! Also try their Russian tea! 

Very friendly people, local and truly a great lunch experience. Cash only."}
