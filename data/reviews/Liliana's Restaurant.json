{"text":"Chef Dave catered our event last week and did a fantastic job.  I was so pleased with the attention to detail and quality of the food.  David and his staff are very attentive and skilled.

I've dined at Liliana's several times over the past year and I've always been impressed with the ambiance of the restaurant.  Great place to take a date."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of 10 people on a busy Saturday night and was thoroughly impressed all around.

Our server, Felicia, Rocked! She was extremely knowledgeable about the entire menu; she told us the top four items they sell as well as her top four personal favorites, complete with descriptions.  Many in our party were new to Cajun cuisine, so it helped a lot.  She was also very on top of keeping our drinks full as she buzzed around the packed restaurant helping all her other tables as well. We never felt like we had to wait for her to return. Her service alone made me want to return...

That being said, the food was delicious and  priced very moderately for the portion size. The only two people unsatisfied at our table were picky eaters.  I am excited to return!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  My wife and I had been there twice before for dinner and really enjoyed it so we decided to come back on our anniversary and sit in the bar for the great live music.  I realize we were sitting in the bar area, but the service this time was very slow and we were left alone for long spans.  

The reason for my bad review:
We ordered a dish that contained mussels.  Half way through eating it my wife realized one of the mussels was still closed.  The waitress went to ask the chef about it and came back to tell us the chef said it happens all the time and its perfectly safe.  We sent the dish away.  Bye bye doggy bag.  
Even if the chef is right and the closed mussel is safe... why would it be served that way?  There were only 3-4 mussels in the dish and it should be easy to check that they are all open.
And also... as a person with a phd in chemistry who now works in biochemistry... I would not eat anything with a closed mussel in it.  Its really not worth the risk.  Also, the FDA tells us to throw out any mussels that do not open.
Just to top off our bad experience we were charged for an extra bottle of wine and had to send the check back.
I'm really sad about the whole thing because we were really starting to like this place and would have gone back regularly.  Instead we left feeling bad about it and a little nervous having also eaten oysters there that night....
I should say that the other 2 times we were there the service was excellent and the food was really good.  I would recommend avoiding dishes with shellfish if the policy on closed mussels is \"it happens all the time\""}
{"text":"This place is a reliable standard for me when I get a craving for Cajun fare.  It has greatly improved from when it first opened, including the seating, service, and menu selections.  It's also very obviously a family affair, as you can often see the chef/owner's parents, wife, son, and daughter (Liliana) present and even helping out.

The tasteful interior is modeled on a Bourbon St./Mardi Gras theme, with iron railings and accents, beads, and photos from New Orleans taken by the chef's father line the walls.  There's even a working fountain sculpture in the main dining area, and you'll also walk past a wall of wine on the way to your seats.  For those looking for alternate seating, there's also a full bar and two outdoor seating areas.  Tuesday through Sunday they feature live musicians, with Jazz as the most played genre.

The Cajun standards are excellent; you can't go wrong with the étouffée, jambalaya, or gumbo - although the étouffée is my favorite, complete with two full crawfish on top. Otherwise, their lunch, dinner and brunch menus typically change quarterly while retaining the standard dishes.  From burgers to beignets, the menu usually has a little bit of everything, and clearly labels vegetarian and spicy dishes.

In addition to their main menu, you can also try their Monday night low-calorie meals, and Monday is also Ladies Night.  And their weekly three course prix fixe menu on Tuesday nights is based on a cooking style, season, ingredient, or other theme (usually $30 per person plus optional $10 for a wine flight).

I would recommend getting on their email list for the latest communications at http://www.lilianasrestaurant.com/, but they also have a Twitter and Facebook presence.

My only criticism would be that it would be nice if their tables were about two inches wider, but that can be easily remedied in the meantime as long as your server is aggressive at clearing the table.  And some other advice would be that if you're visiting during one of their super-special events that you plan for a little extra time as this might be the first time they've attempted something like it before.

And I almost forgot to mention, they've recently begun offering take-out, which is really nice when I want some comfort food after a long day and I don't feel like making dinner.  This is also a good alternative when you're having people over to watch football or whatever."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the Madison area. Attended their 5-course meals over a year ago and I still consider it to be one of the best meals I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Oh my!  Tonight was my first visit and my husband's second.  We were using some Madison Original gift certificates so had nothing to lose.  I was and am  soooo impressed!  Had the blackened catfish.  I'm from the NW and my family ran a small fleet of fishing boats so of course  my top fish choices have been off the boat halibut and salmon.  Their catfish was so moist it melted in one's mouth.  My side salad was beautiful and delicious.  Mr. had the jambalaya and loved it.  It had been a while since he first went there for lunch with our daughter.  The restaurant was just getting off the ground and they both felt the portions were too small for the price.  So going in he was a little apprehensive.  But that was quickly dispelled.  I would be proud to take  any of my friends and family for dinner.  The jazz in the bar set the right mood for the beautiful and romantic restaurant.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. Live Jazz Music Thursday through Friday evenings. The music is kept at a soft level, despite being live. and even when sitting 2 tables away from the performers, my guest and I were able to engage in conversation easily without needing to raise our voices. 

The wine selection is quite decent, as are the drinks. For the most part the bartenders have been great, but sometimes if they are busy they will not even acknowledge you are there. 

Food Review: The calamari was so-so on flavor, but wins points for not having a rubbery texture. The dill pickles were very good, and the cheese plate was astounding! Very good aged cheeses and Wisconsin made mustards. 

The desserts have also been good. The Chocolate mouse is. to. die. for! This is not your 'whip cream' chocolate mousse. This is thick, rich, slightly salty chocolate decadence. Pair it with the beignets for a delicious treat. The banana's Foster is also pretty good. They also serve French Press Coffee, which is a definite bonus.

now, the entrees. This is where the rating loses a star for me. The first time I went, I had seared scallops with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes. It was simply Amazing! my friend had the flank steak and that was delicious as well. The next time I went and ordered the scallops (without looking at the menu, which is my fault) They were served with some veggies and sweet potato puree. it wasn't bad, but it was more bland. I preferred the spicy Wasabi Mashed. Another trip back for the Tilapia for me and the Filet Mignon for a friend was good, but nothing spectacular. 

Summary: Great place for drinks and apps or to stop and splurge on dessert and coffee."}
{"text":"I wasn't really expecting a full sit-down, cloth napkin restaurant.  When I got there it was a surprise!  The server was really friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Jambalaya.  It was outstanding!  The only problem (if you can call it that) was that there was too much food!  I was packed when I left.  It was pretty expensive.  The Jambalaya was $16.  Add a soda and gratuity and the total lunch bill for just me was $23.  Nevertheless... if you're a fan of cajun/creole cuisine, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place so much if marriage between more than two people with at least one of those people being a corporation becomes legal than I will totally marry it. 

I feel that the head chef here is incredibly complex and nuanced in an amazing modern way.  The food is always amazing, original, and interesting. My husband always blind orders the special and has never been let down.

The lunch special is an amazing deal to boot."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by at 6 on a weekday. Say at the bar and heard the live jazz music which is good to set the mood. Consumed several things - a Frog's Leap Zin, Dirty Rice topped with a Blackened Catfish and a Filet steak. All were excellent. Having had a steak at Rare the prior weekend, have to say that the steak here was just as good at a fraction of Rare prices. The catfish and dirty rice were terrific - fish was flaky and spicy and the rice a perfect complement.  Have been here several times before and gotta say the food and service were terrific. A real family feeling among the staff."}
{"text":"This Review is for brunch only. I went for brunch about 12:30pm last Sunday. There were only a few other people in the restaurant. Overall, we were disappointed in the food. Service was ok, except our waitress failed to tell us they were out of the cajun potatoes and were subbing \"sweet potato hash.\"  The server at the next table informed his patrons before they ordered and let them sub items.  The hash consisted of cold,diced sweet potatoes with little to no seasoning.  The cajun bloody mary was very watery. It was kind of like drinking hot sauce and water. The fruit crepes were packed with exorbitant amounts of  cream cheese. The outer crepe was doughey.  The sausage omelette was overcooked and came with the potato disappointment. The only good meal was the banana foster french toast, which we ended up sharing. After this meal, I would not take the time to go back and try dinner."}
{"text":"It is tasty, standard Cajun food.  The food doesn't live up to the price in my opinion. Highlight of when I've been is the Alligator appetizer."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to try this place so hit them up at the Agora Art Fair. After one bite of cornbread, I had to throw it away. It tasted like a gummy glob of white flour. I've had less then stellar cornbread plenty of times, but it's usually still edible. This was not.

But it was fabulous compared to the red beans and rice. They were only lukewarm when served so I neglected to have any. My dining companion was starving, so ate some anyway. Couldn't even finish the tiny 6 dollar cup of them they were so bad. Lucky me and poor him -- he got food poisoning from them.

Never again."}
{"text":"Went to Liliana's to celebrate my wife's birthday on Monday (4/19/2010).  We have eaten here several times before and it has become one of our favorite restaurants in the area for the combination of its ambiance, the food, the art and it's creole influence.  The birthday meal was a custom prepared menu with wine pairings, flowers and a cake.  Monday was perfect because they weren't busy.  No live music on Monday but nice background music was playing all night.  They have a beautiful fountain by a local artist and wrought iron decor on their windows.  The pictures shown don't do justice to the decor. or the food.  Service has been attentive all the times we have been here but was especially good this night.  Our waiter was Peter and he was excellent.

We have spent some time in New Orleans and our daughter lived there for a while.  Liliana's would be right at home in the \"Big Easy.\"  The food was very good but I would mention several especially outstanding items (they may not be on regular menu).  The Asparagus Soup for the first course was very good.  The salad course  was an Arugula salad with roast walnuts and Moody Blue Cheese and a truffle v vinaigrette dressing.  It was outstanding.  The blue cheese was very smooth, the greens delightful and the dressing sublime.  I noted a previous reviewer mentioning blue cheese being overdone.  That was not the case here.  The appetizer course was a braised short rib with smoked potato puree and wilted kale with a Creole meuniere sauce.  This was more like a main entrée.  This was the most outstanding dish.  My wife and I both agreed it was one of the best dishes we have ever had and we have eaten out at very good restaurants in many major cities for many years and are both fairly accomplished cooks.  The main entrée was a roasted pork chop with asparagus and roasted sweet potatoes.  Ironically this was ok but probably the weakest of all the courses.  The dessert was a lemon cake which was very good.  The cake itself was very lemony with natural lemon flavor.  Only possible complaint was that the frosting was a bit greasy.

The wine pairings were very good.  We especially liked the Willow Glen Old Tawny Port  (Australian) with the desert and the \"cav\" with the Appetizer course which was  Cabernet Sauvignon Santa Florintina 2008, Famintina Valley, Argentina (not sure spellings are correct).

From previous visits would especially recommend two desserts which are as good as I've ever had in New Orleans; the beignets which are bigger and as good or better than the Cafe Du Monde's in New Orleans (the gold standard for beignets) and the bread pudding which is gigantic (share for two) and some of the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot).

We are very fortunate to have a restaurant like this in this area.  They are relatively new and probably still learning and may make some faux pas .  I noted several negative reviews which were not my personal experience but I am sure they will achieve consistency in service and food.  They tell me many of their staff have been with them since they opened and our waiter even helped with some of the work in building the restaurant.  Some of the things we have tried in the past have been from ok to outstanding.  What is impressive to me is that they are dedicated to preparing outstanding dishes and are improving as time goes on.   More chef/owners is exactly what we need in Madison, anywhere for that matter."}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend expecting some pretty good creole food. The restaurant was brightly lit with a nice atmosphere provided by the jazz band. We were served cornmeal and a biscuit to start off with, but the biscuit seemed a bit dry and bland.

I ordered the creole bouillabaisse, and my girlfriend ordered the pulled pork pasta. Parts of my meal were tasty, but what was most off-putting was the lump of undercooked fish that I unfortunately took a bite off of. It was still red and gamy in the center -___-  . The pulled pork was oily and salty.

Overall, the environment was pleasant, but if you want good creole food, look elsewhere (hint: Louisianne's in Middleton serves bar-none the best creole food in the area)."}
{"text":"This place was great.  At first I was a skeptical of the environment.  But the live music and warm atmosphere really got me. 

We got the gluten free bruschetta which was great!  Then I ordered the chicken diablo.  Man, that was amazing! Their hot sauce was fantastic also. The chocolate mousse was so rich and creamy. This was a great meal. 

On top of that our waiter was friendly and helpful. Even thanked us for coming in after we ate. This experience was wonderful. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that you really want to love but just can't. 

The decor and ambiance are great.  The menu is creative, unique for the area, and the menu items read like they are going to be delicious. So at first you are really excited to be there and want to believe that you've found a gem.

Then the waiting starts. You wait and wait for drinks.  You wait and wait for corn bread (which, by the way is delicious). You are pretty hopeful about the food because the cornbread is so good. You wait and wait and wait some more. You cut them some slack and make an effort to keep a good attitude. After all, the environment is really nice, the (now long-gone) cornbread was awesome, and you remember how good the meal you ordered sounded.  Can't wait to get that food! Nevertheless, you wait. And you wait...

Then the food comes and reality sets in.  The risotto is bland. The meat is overcooked, under seasoned, stringy, and full of fat. The sides and non-meat dishes are just \"meh\".  

Then the bill comes and reality sets in even more. You think to yourself \"How in the world did dinner for two come out to $90?...  Oh yeah, I remember, this is supposed to be a nice restaurant.\"  

My advice is to stick to drinks and appetizers, which are actually pretty good. There's less of a chance the rug will be pulled out from under you this way."}
{"text":"My mom has been telling me about Liliana's for a long time and today, I finally had the pleasure of tasting what she has been raving about. It was a great location to meet for a business lunch and the 2 items for $10 was a fantastic value!!! Not only was it reasonable, it was so delicious!! I'm GF and the choices were exceptional, almost everything seemed to have a GF option. I ordered the salad & GF po'boy and it was way more food than I expected!! The waitress, Genna, was so nice and accommodating. As a replacement for corn bread (unfortunately not GF there) she brought a small plate of fresh veggies with a yummy olive tapenade. I will most definitely be back, YUM!!"}
{"text":"Three friends and I went to Liliana's last night excited to grab what's been touted as Madison's best cajun/creole food. Instead, we received four chairs and no service. I'm genuinely not sure if Liliana's is a self-serve restaurant since we ordered a beer at 6 and 6:30 and did not get either by the time we left at 7:10. We also ordered four waters and only received three. We tried to get our waitress' attention so we could inform the restaurant that we were leaving but she literally did not tam to check on our table in the half hour before we left.
The cornbread was delicious doe. And I suppose if I were on a diet, I'd be thankful that Liliana's refused to serve me so that I could stick with that. However, as someone who went to a restaurant to drink and eat, I was rather disappointed. Honestly 1 star seems generous as I'm sure if I'd ordered a star at Liliana's, I wouldn't have received one within the hour."}
{"text":"Crab cakes are fantastic and they have a very big bar selection.
Didn't like my main course, but not because of bad taste, just wasn't my kinda food.
Will definitely go back for appetizers and drinks though."}
{"text":"Decor was beautiful. Service... not so much. 

I went about 2 weeks ago with my sister and my nephew at around 3 in the afternoon. We were the only people there. Cornbread and jalapeno butter... awesome. The tenderloin bruschetta was awesome. Our entrees... not so much. We got a parmesan and butter pasta for the little one, and all you could really taste was the gallons of olive oil poured on top of it. The jambalaya was just very salty and not that flavorful."}
{"text":"Very uneven. My birthday dinner; one person ordered the chicken diablo and the chicken was dry.  I ordered filet nad lobster.  Filet was excellent but where was the lobster?  All I got were three tiny pieces of claws??? from a lobster and they had the consistency of rubber.  Chewy, no taste.  What a waste of money.  However, a great find was the steak bruschetta.  Third friend had the catfish po'boy and he enjoyed it.  Don't get the steak and rubber meal.  The chocolate mousse was rich and creamy and oh so delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Liliana's it is our standby for when we want to go out to dinner and make it easy. We enjoy everything there from the Appetizers to the desserts. The Tuesday night tasting menu is great, they have a different theme every week and for $25 it is great 3 course meal.

My wife really enjoys the tilapia and I will always go back for the corn bread."}
{"text":"Love their Thursday wine tastings, and great wine restaurant overall. It is a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriends family for Christmas eve dinner.   I have nothing but great things to say for this place.    
The atmosphere was very festive from the moment you walked in. Live instrumental holiday music, good lighting and smiling staff. We were greeted by the owner and his daughter (adorable little girl I must say). 
They had a 4 course holiday menu, with wine for each course if wanted. 
Course 1 was a creamy pumkin soup with a cinnamon creme freche.   I was excited that my boyfriend did not like punpkin, so I got them both. 
Course 2 was an arugula salad paired with a delicious cranberry orange (I think) vinaigrette and candied walnuts.    I also ate 2. (This is why I am not skinny) 
Course 3 was the best, I only got 1.   Turkey stuffed with cranberry, green beans and potato smash.     Absolutely phenomenal. The turkey fell apart to with a touch, and the cranberry addition was just right. 
Course 4 was a pumpkin cheesecake with a ginger swirl.   It was so fluffy and yummy. (And I'm a very picky cheesecake eater).
I would definitely come back to try the regular menu. 
For being a full restaurant, we got quick service with a smile, and delectable food. 
I'm already craving more."}
{"text":"We love Liliana's, especially for breakfast. Bottomless mimosas this morning were amazing and the crab cakes benedict were predictably amazing."}
{"text":"Generally a very good environment. New Orleans type environment, with great food. Bar area is fun. Often live jazz music. This place is one of our regular stops. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The jambalaya was fantastic. A very nice cajun oasis in southern Wisconsin. The jambalaya was fantastic. the waitstaff was very attentive and it was worth the wait for a table, only 20 minutes or so and we had no reservations and it was a Friday night. And the jambalaya was fantastic."}
{"text":"Being new to Madison, and a former New Orleans resident, I was hoping I would love this place.  I got a chance to take my wife on a rare dinner date, and we both ate until we were stuffed!  We were greeted and given mardi gras beads by Lily, our 7-year-old hostess.  She was sweet, and funny, and checked up on us during the meal.  Quite entertaining. The highlight of the meal was Cajun fried cheese curds with tempura batter.  I'd been told in advance that these were awesome, and after the first bite, they immediately climbed into the \"best in Madison\" position.  The cornbread and house-made butter was melt-in-your mouth.  I craved some raw oysters on the half-shell and enjoyed those with excellent cocktail sauce.  For entrees, I ordered the crawfish etoufee and my wife had the smoked tofu.  I was pleasantly surprised that the etoufee was garnished with boiled crawfish and a few plump shrimp.  The only thing that was moderately disappointing was the sazerac, one of my favorite drinks.  I was probably looking forward to that as much as anything, but it tasted a bit overly sweet and kind of watered down.  We only got to hear a bit of the jazz before we left, but it sounded great, and next time we'll look forward to staying longer.  All in all, an excellent, affordable experience!"}
{"text":"Update:
I have recently been back and I was not disappointed. I tried the pasta liliana (not my favorite) but also got to test the catfish which was really really good (I'm not a huge fish fan either). The dirty rice and corn maque choux fixings upon which the catfish were delicious.

Additionally I got to try the cajun fried cheese curds which although I couldn't really taste the creole spice were very good nonetheless, one of the best fried curds I've tried so far.

For dessert I got to try multiple dishes (perks of going out with family :p). The foster bread pudding was delectable with a perfect caramelization on the bananas, the chocolate moose was rich and smooth (though it is a thicker moose than what I would typically think of).

Thanks Liliana's! Continued wishes on your behalf!

******************

Thank you Liliana's for an experience... not just a meal :)

Time: 
We visited on a chilly Saturday a little after noon. At his time the place was quite and fairly empty, perfect for a quite little lunch with a spunky child in tow.

Atmosphere: 
With the jazzy music softly playing in the background, and our kid adorned with a new strand of Mardi Gras Beads, the hostess led us down an alley decorated with street lamps to the seating area bright with natural sunlight streaming. A calming fountain bubbled softly near us which also gave our daughter some entertainment while waiting for the food.

Staff: 
The hostess and waiter were both pleasant, friendly, and professional. The knew his stuff. When asked to elaborate this beautifully fragrant  bean/couscous dish that was served with our meals, without hesitation the dish was explained. 

Our Order:
Blue Cheese Burger - Excellent! This was a wonderfully seasoned dish with just the right amount and strength of blue cheese. Possibly the best burger in town... and we have tried over a dozen!!!

Fried Shrimp Po'Boy - At first bite I wasn't sure if I quite liked it but by the end of the sandwich I was crying for more. The hose made mayo was a delightful addition though I did need to add a dash more of salt and pepper.

Cup of Gumbo - I don't think I have much authority on this dish. I have tried gumbo a grand total of 3 times now and each time I have had the same reaction... I don't really like it! From my limited experience it was good but not amazing... Not enough to make me a fan of gumbo... I still need to be converted.

Benyas - These came absolutely drenched in powdered sugar, just as they should. As I remarked to my wife, these were good but I don't think they were up to restaurant snuff. I would expect a twist to make this a memorable dish. Although they tasted good, I think it would be divine if they tried to do something more special than simply frying and dusting with powdered sugar. Perhaps in triangles served with a small scoop of homemade cinnamon ice cream to balance the warm benyas and their delicious crunch.

Sides - All main dishes came with a white bean and couscous salad with mixed herbs. It smelled wonderful and also tasted pretty good though I think the beans could have been cooked a minute longer as they were slightly tough to my liking. A nice fresh side to the heavier portion of a meal. 
Now the best most absolutely amazing part of the meal was the sweet potato crisps. They were not oily at all and just absolutely shined with sweet potato and salt flavor. Liliana's is almost worth going to just for the potato crisps!

Verdict:
Wonderful atmosphere, pleasant staff, delicious food, affordable, and kid friendly. I would definitely recommend this and will return again! Thanks Liliana's."}
{"text":"I really like Liliana's, but my husband has had terrible luck with what he orders. Even though he monopolized the amazing cornbread in the bread basket, I don't know if I'll be able to convince him to try again. We started with pretty good cevice, and I had black bean cakes with chimichuri sauce for my dinner. Both of these dishes are new to the summer menu and made for a great dinner on a warm July evening. The husband's salad was overly bleu cheesed to the point where he couldn't really taste much else the rest of the evening. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Steak was over cooked, but after it was fixed it was delicious.  My wife had the file' gumbo and would give it a four.  The angus filet and sides were excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent wine list.  Try the Farari Carano cab. Crab cakes are to die for as are the various baked oysters."}
{"text":"Before coming to this restaurant, I read reviews here on Yelp and noticed how much the ratings fluctuated.  I should've listened to my instinct and skipped the place.  But we were mainly there for a music performance so the experience wasn't shot, but I've definitely had better food and wine at other places.  

If you go here, make sure to check and remember what you ordered and the price.  My husband and I ordered the Cheese and Charcuterie Board (menu said $11) along with beer and wine.  When our order came, we noticed our Board contained only cheese and no charcuterie; but then again, we thought we read the menu wrong.  When we returned home, we checked the online menu and yes, our appetizer should've included some homemade meats and fresh fruit with the cheese, crostini and nuts.  We had the cheese, crostini, and nuts, but somehow no meat or fresh fruit----leafy greens were added to mask what was missing.  This was quite disappointing.  We were also charged $15 for the plate.

I'm also a bit wary of how long their wines sit out in the fridge or the bar.  Sure, the wine list goes on forever and they have a very large selection, but you have to wonder how many of those 1/2 opened bottles of wine have been sitting there....To their credit, the service was \"super-nice and friendly,\" but the food and wine was definitely lacking."}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant.  They have a great selection on their menu and everything I have had has been fantastic.  Locally owned with a very friendly atmosphere.  Excellent selection of wine, as well.  My favorite dish:  Jambalaya."}
{"text":"Love the truffled endive salad, corn bread/jalapeño butter, mushroom pasta, cheese curds, steak bruschetta. Nice wines, I eat at the bar-never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Our bartender/server Jeremiah was top notch with his recommendations and timing.  I don't like food too hot so they offered the \"heat\" on the side.   Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is OK.
It isn't as good as I would expect for the prices you pay. We were seated next to a hallway where the waiters drop off used utensils from other customers. So it was noisy the whole time as the waitstaff continuously dropped dishes into the dirty bin. I wonder who came up with the idea to place diners near such an area?
The Endive Salad appetizer was great. I highly recommend it. 
We ordered a beer off the beer menu and they were out of it. So that was a disappointment. Waiter did suggest another beer and said it would be on the house if we didn't like it.
Ordered the Filet Mignon and were disappointed. The filet was very small, didn't have enough sauce on it, claimed to come with asparagus (and really came with three itty bitty pieces of asparagus tips). For the price we paid for the filet we were disappointed.
We had Banana Fosters for dessert wich was outstanding. 
If I ever go back to Liliana's I will order the salad and dessert again. But am not yet sure if Liliana's will be at the top of my list, especially for the prices they charge."}
{"text":"This is a time that I really, REALLY wish you could give half-star reviews. I mean, I know everyone says that, but it would be really applicable to this situation. 

I dined at Liliana's this past Saturday, and I would rank it as a 3.5 star experience. I'd never been to Liliana's before despite living in Madison for close to 10 years. (I know, I was shocked too). The experience was fun, overall.

The atmosphere is nice. The dining area and bar are cute.  We had a reservation and arrived a bit early. We had to wait a few minutes, but were still seated by the time our reservation was scheduled for, so it was fair.

We were seated and service initially seemed really attentive. The waiter took our drink and appetizer order, and brought the first round and appetizer out promptly. We then ordered our entrees, and I ordered a second drink. Here is where the experience started to go downhill slightly. About 15 minutes after I ordered my second drink (a glass of wine), the waiter came back to ask me what I had ordered again. I guess he forgot? I used to be a server, and I know that's easy to do when you're swamped, but he never mentioned the error. He finally brought the wine out about 45 minutes after I ordered it. If you're keeping track, you'll notice that over an hour has passed since we were initially seated, and still no entrees. Other tables seated after us were also delivered their entrees before we got ours. 

So, after waiting seemingly forever for our entrees, I was disappointed when, famished, I dug into mine (jambalaya) and it was lukewarm. Again, I suspect the server was swamped and probably didn't bring it out when it was actually ready, and hot. I wouldn't write Liliana's off based on this experience alone, but a couple other reviewers note the same thing about service. Maybe they just need a couple more waiters or something. 

The food was fairly average, but tasty. The jambalya would have been better if it were served hot. I actually preferred my husband's dish, the Diablo Chicken (served on grits) to mine. Our cheesecurds appetizer was also good, but you can get good fried cheese almost anywhere (God, I love this state!). In short, Liliana's was not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there if it involved a long wait or something."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding and the ambiance was great.  From the cornbread to the walnut/feta salad to the entrees the food was tasty and well presented without being overly spiced (one of our worries with Cajun style food).  The ingredients were fresh.  We especially liked the use of the caramelized onions.  The decor was pleasant and the open space was nice.  The room was quiet enough to hear each other easily."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during the Restaurant Week. Very good food from salad, main course to dessert (amazing presentation)- Will definitely not miss this place next time in town-"}
{"text":"I would recommend visiting Liliana's after the sun goes down, because before that it's too bright with the many windows and you don't get to appreciate chandeliers and live candles on the tables. When it's dark out and all the light comes from the inside, this restaurant is beautiful and the sun isn't blinding you, making it hard to enjoy the food. There is a very attractive wine rack taking up a whole wall, a large bar, comfortable waiting chairs, and tables cleverly placed throughout the restaurant. If you can, get a spot in the spacious dining room. It provides a better ambiance than the tables near the bar, where the lighting is harsher and it is more crowded. There are jazz bands playing on many nights (New Orleans style, of course), and they are always spot on, never too loud, adding just the right feel to the ambiance. 
   To start off, get the cornbread, mac 'n' cheese, or both. The cornbread is smooth, moist, and just perfect. I don't even like cornbread, but sometimes all you need is the right preparation. 
   My go-to entrée at this restaurant would have to be the jambalaya. Perfect mixture of ham, Andouille sausage, bacon, peppers, onions, and tomatoes, And the rice. Not much to say about rice in general. It was the perfect amount of spicy. The one downside to this dish, and, based on reading other reviews, most dishes, is that the shrimp portion is a major letdown. I got one shrimp in my half-order. On a related note, a half-order of most of the dishes is a good size for most people. Whole orders are just too big in my opinion. 
   The only truly negative thing I have to say about this restaurant is the service. Some of the waiters can be inattentive at times and it takes a long time to get your food. I understand that it's busy, but twenty minutes for cornbread? 
   I would recommend this place for a first date or if you're just looking for some good cajun food."}
{"text":"I've been to Liliana's twice for lunch, and once for happy hour.  This is not a great location for a business lunch as the service was somewhat intrusive.  We can forgive that, however, and realize that they may not really have wanted us to conduct a meeting there during lunch.  What is inexcusable is the experience my friend and I had a few weeks ago during happy hour.

We met at Liliana's to take advantage of their drink specials and happy hour prices for food.  Our drinks were fine, and at $5.00, not unreasonably priced.  However, the bartender took it upon himself to add ingredients to our food that increased the price by 50%.  This went unnoticed until we went to settle the tab, and when confronted, the bartender said \" I do that all the time- is that a problem?\".  Um, yes, it is a problem if my $6 quesadilla becomes a $9 quesadilla and you try to slip it by me.  

Frankly, it's this experience that will keep us from ever going there again because I'm still so steamed I can't imagine having a good time there."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and have to say that I am really pleased by the concept.  As a gluten-free diner, it's great to have so many choices.  The unique New Orleans-themed decor is enhanced by custom metal-work art.  And the Cajun-inspired cuisine is well-executed.  I tried the mac-n-cheese (gluten-free) on my second visit.  It came in a cast-iron Wisconsin-shaped pan.  Nicely done.  My only critique of this dish is that the cheese is so salty already, that I would consider adding a meat that is flavorful, but not salt-cured.  I was actually unable to eat all of it at one sitting due to pending sodium overload.  My previous visit was during the warm time of the year, and we were able to enjoy the outdoor seating and live music outside.  This is a lovely spot, and I wish them great success.  As other reviewers have noted, this seems to be a unique concept in this part of the country.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have never been disappointed. On my most recent trip I came for lunch with the gf and family. I did the lunch special with gumbo and the blackened shrimp po boy. The food was done perfectly per usual. Great, classy spot for some good New Orleans cuisine."}
{"text":"Awesome place to have dinner. I'm from out of town. Great grits and shrimp. Steak and lobster was amazing."}
{"text":"I am still on the hunt for delicious shrimp and grits. Thought I'd try my luck at Liliana's, since I've never been before. 

We came on a Sunday night abs the place was pretty tame, few patrons at the bar with drinks in hand and a handful of tables already served. 

Our group of four were sat by the friendly host who have the girls beads upon arrival. Sadly that's where the great service ended. 

The server took our drink orders of Pat O'Briens and disappeared. He came back later to take our food orders and said the bartenders were backed up. 

20 min later we finally get our drinks. 

I will say the only winner of the night was the corn bread. Moist, crumbly, and fragrant of honey, they were perfect morsels to satisfy anyone. 

Our group ordered the pasta Liliana, tilapia, Diablo chicken, shrimp and grits, scallops from the small plate menu and a cup of gumbo. 

First I'd like to point out that all of our dishes arrived lukewarm. 

The pasta ($17) had almost no flavor and the chicken and sausage were greasy, with very little Cajun flavor. I would not name this dish as my namesake pasta.  

The tilapia ($17) was very good,  with perfect amount of breadcrumbs covering the delicate fish. The bed of veggies was again lukewarm. 

The Diablo chicken ($17) looked more impressive than it tasted. The Sirracha sauce was very tame,  not spicy at all. 

The shrimp and grits ($7) were a let down. The grits were poofy, almost the same texture as marshmallow fluff. However I will say that the TWO shrimps that arrived with the dish was very good and cooked perfectly. 

The scallop dish was average. It came again with TWO scallops that looked almost flattened,  as if made from one lump scallop. I guess I had higher hopes for the $7 price tag.

The gumbo was the biggest let down. We've had many bowls of gumbo in NOLA and none of them had rice on the bottom. My dining companions believe it's a strategy to serve less gumbo for the price at $6 for a cup. 

The service was painfully slow. The dishes were disappointing. We probably will never return again. For the $125+ bill, the service and food was not on par for the price. 

...and the search for great Cajun food continues..."}
{"text":"First I'll have to say I don't like spicy food so asked what I could order that was not spicy.  Server was very helpful with my questions.  I had the endive salad and was not impressed - it was okay but would have been a lot better if the nuts in it were candied, it needed more contrast in the flavors.  Corn bread was good.  For dinner, had the special which was chicken coq a vin, greens with bacon, and potatoes.  Didn't really care for it.  The chicken was a leg and thigh, cooked well, but wasn't what I've thought of as coq a vin, kind of tasted like it was cooked in wine and soy sauce and the flavor pretty much stayed in the skin of the chicken which was okay because I didn't think the flavor was that great, but left me with eating plain tasting chicken meat.  Only ate about 1/4 of it.  The potatoes were ok, nothing special.  The greens left me with a yucky taste in my mouth, maybe too much smoky flavor.  My dining companion had the vegetable Wellington and I tried it, actually thought it was really good, wish I had ordered that, although it was a bit rich it had a lot of flavor.  Service was okay, attentive until the check was paid at which time we were totally abandoned though we did stay a bit to chat (the restaurant was not busy) - that's not too unusual though.  After hearing so much hype, left feeling disappointed.  Maybe you have to be really into Cajun food to appreciate this place."}
{"text":"Loved it! Loved it! =)  Very nice looking place both inside and out! The space inside it is very open and relaxing.  Our server Laura was the sweetest!  She was super helpful with the menu and suggested some great wine!

We had the crab cakes for appetizers! Yummy!  I love crab cakes & they made them great the dipping sauce was very good as well!
 
For my main I had the Andouille Crusted Tilapia.. it had great flavor, it was excellent. I really loved the Sweet potatoes that came with it too! 

Everything was excellent!!  I would recommend this establishment to anyone!  They also have a great website if you want to view the menu and history.  

The Restaurant is named after the chefs daughter! Ahhhhhhhh 
She is soo adorable!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Liliana's three times.  Each time we hoped to come back and have a better experience than the last.  The first time we ordered a wine and app combo.  The server knew nothing about the wine and didn't even know how to properly pour it...they spilled it all over the table.  Our meals that evening were so so, but nothing to come back for.  The second time our food came and it was cold.  Our server said she was really busy so she took them back and obviously just put them under the lights because the outside was warm but the inside was still cold.  The third time we had such terrible service-the server was too busy chatting it up with a table full of her friends than to bring us our drinks.  I think this place has a lot of potential-great atmosphere and good food.  They just need to be more consistant and make sure their servers are bringing the food out when it's hot!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times with mixed results. We had breakfast here with my parents and it was horrific. Our meals came out cold. As in, were not even remotely warm. Their remedy for that was to pop the dishes in the microwave and give us free beignets. Our dinner experience was ok, but our dishes were soaked in oil and made us feel sick afterwards. Our happy hour experience was great. They have an extensive wine collection and nice appetizers. The ambiance is great and live music is a plus since they book very talented musicians. If Liliana's management reads this, I would recommend that you use less oil on your dishes and hire more conscientious wait staff."}
{"text":"Don't get the oysters as they are disgusting. The only thing good here was the homemade butter that comes with the bread. Otherwise this place should be put out of business."}
{"text":"We ate at Lilliana's on Mother's Day, and they were serving a buffet. For $40.00 per person, the buffet had several items, all worse than the other. Scrambled eggs, roasted potatoes, bacon, corn bread, Jambalaya, cookies, Caesar Salad were all terrible. Service was pleasant, but inept. I still have the sensation of pulling the hair out of my mouth that accompanied the Caesar Salad stuck in my mind. The Bloody Mary was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Lilliana's. Every time we visit we discover another wonderful appetizer, meal or dessert. Always great service. Great live music in the bar most evenings. Awesome brunch. A few favs - catfish, scallops, steak bruschetta, cornbread, crab cakes egg Benedict, bananas foster French toast... the list goes on! Great drink menu as well and the owner and head chef Dave can often be seen making sure everyone is enjoying their time at Lilliana's. Thanks for being awesome!"}
{"text":"I ate there once...  The cornbread should be called corn cake it's so sweet... It's a nice attempt a Creole food but misses the mark by a mile!!! I have to say though it has a huge wine list and I was impressed"}
{"text":"Went for Thurs 2 tapas & 2 wines. Very good. Also had the Tomato Bisque and it was delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well we just came back from our first visit to Liliana's. First off, our request for Outdoor Dining actually ended up seating us inside. Our request for preferred \"quiet\" seating was not taken into consideration. Next, after we ordered dinner we waited for over 55 minutes for our food (table of 7). My wife's second glass of wine was not the same as the first glass, however our waiter did replace it but not until he sniffed it at the table, second guessing us. When our food finally arrived it was obvious it sat under heating lamps, my order of Creole Trio showed obvious signs being congealed and my daughter's Creole Bouillabaisse, my wife's Pasta Liliana showed over dryness especially to all items on top.
 
What a disappointment."}
{"text":"This was a last minute plan - but it turned out to be first rate!

A friend met me in Madison on New Years Eve at around 9 p.m. and we headed to a 10:15 p.m. reservation at LIliana's for the New Years Eve 6 course meal.  It was almost a perfect 100 on my score chart!

There were two choices for each course and so my friend and I ordered one of each so we can taste everything.  The only thing I was completely happy with was the very first starter of the duck pate - I had yucky rubbery chunks of liver in my pate and it tasted very much livery (I like pates that are very subtle).  

Everything else was divine!  I especially loved the ham and bean soup - oh my word it was good!  And the pork that I had just fell off the bone and melted in your mouth.

The waiter was so nice and really helped make the evening enjoyable just by chatting and going out of his way to make sure all was good.  Since it was new years eve, we asked about glasses of champagne and he just brought us a bottle - all the other tables were given bottles as well.  It was such a nice touch.

There was a live band playing and around 11:30, the owner (head chef) of the restaurant and his daughter (Liliana, the restaurant's namesake) came around to all the tables to ask us to stay for the countdown and see if we enjoyed the food and all.  I thought that was really hospitable and made me think that they actually were concerned that their patrons were enjoying everything.

They had a countdown and we were all given party hats and horns and all.  

What a great New Years Eve and what a fabulous meal to end 2011 and ring in 2012!"}
{"text":"Great food.  We typically sit at the bar and always have great service.  The jambalaya, gumbo and etoufee are all very good.  We usually get half orders and share and still have plenty to take home.   The bruschettas are all very good.  Oysters are always very fresh and delicious.  Good food, excellent service."}
{"text":"Why haven't I reviewed this place yet? I love Liliana's, and I love Dave Heide! I could write for days about the menu, and how wonderful Brian is when he takes care of us on Tuesday's. 
On Tuesday the restaurant has a 3 course menu for $25 and you can get wine pairings with it for an extra $10.  It always themed, and delicious. There is also a great jazz trio every Tuesday that is perfect. Not too loud, but just right. 
The cornbread and jalapeño butter is to die for. It's not spicy, I promise! The mac and cheese is one of my faves, but you can't go wrong. 
Dave is also great about making dietary mods, so if you have certain needs and don't see it on the menu feel free to ask. They might be able to accommodate."}
{"text":"Service was very fast, and the staff was friendly. Upon entering they'll ask you whether a vegetarian or vegan menu is needed, gluten free options are already marked on the menus (which is great and hassle free), one complaint is that the menus are OLD- tattering, and faded. Would it hurt to have them reprinted? Once you walk in, it is also clear it's not nearly as big as the pictures might have you believe, but it's comfortably small. We got to pick either dining room, bar, or patio seating and for about the whole time we were there around 5pm- 5:30pm on a Friday night there were only about four other groups dining. Our waitress said they usually get busy around 6-6:30pm. We've never had creole food before but thought it was pretty good other than the shrimp creole which my one of my dining buddies had and thought was very salty, not spicy but salty. However another person in our party had the shrimp creole and thought it was wonderful so I would say it all depends on individual palates, I think you could also ask not to have salt added to your dish since there are salt and pepper shakers at each table. Cornbread and a herbed butter (which everyone at my table and the couple seated next to us said was amazing) are complimentary while you wait for your food, which arrived very quickly for us. Every plate looked amazing! Large portion sizes too. I can't handle spicy foods well, however I felt this place was a perfect introduction to cajun style cooking and didn't find it very spicy at all. Unfortunately there were no  gluten free desserts that day but I wasn't necessarily complaining after conquering a large delicious bowl of jambalaya. Liliana's is a new favourite of mine and I've been dreaming about going back for more of their jambalaya ever since that amazing experience. Friendly, helpful staff, quick service and amazing food- I would especially recommend this place for any group with certain dietary needs who doesn't want to settle on boring options that other restaurants have."}
{"text":"I came in on Sunday expecting a quick lunch, but was offered a brunch menu. 

The crab cake eggs Benedict was very good. I sampled the banana foster as well, but it was too sweet for my palate. 

All brunch orders come with corn bread coffee cake before the entrees arrive, which my whole table thought were exceptional. 

Drink wise their loaded Bloody Mary was above average, built from scratch with three spice levels. 

They also offer bottomless mimosas for 8$, which I believe is the cheapest bottomless mimosa brunch option in the Madison area."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and (keep in mind that the lunch menu on the weekend is a little more limited) it was pretty average. The food was good quality but it was kind of lacking in flavor. I was expecting to get my butt kicked with spice and flavor and it fell short. I really liked the corn bread. It was so moist and fluffy, I could have had 3 of them. I also really liked the sweet potato chips. They were so light and thin and delicious! As for the chicken creole, I wasn't impressed. Like I previously mentioned, it was missing NOLA flavor I was excited to get. Its possible that it could be better if I tried dinner since the menu has a lot more items."}
{"text":"I'm smitten! We had a wonderful dinner tonight. The food is really different from anything I've eaten in Dane County in the past decade. 

The space is lovely and polished, which I would not have guessed from the location. The cornbread that arrived soon after we sat down was tender and sweet. 

My blackened catfish entree was so delicious. The flavors and textures complimented each other and there was just the right amount of heat. 

I also want to stress how friendly the place is for kids. There is a great kids menu, but I was really impressed with the fruit and veggie plate that came before their entrées. It was beautifully presented and my kids chowed down on the fresh arrangement. 

The live jazz trio was also a pleasure. What a gem this place is. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We've heard great things so we were looking forward to trying Liliana's for Restaurant  Week. The ambiance was nice and the service was totally pleasant. If this place was closer to home, we'd likely give it another shot, but based on our experience, I'm not certain we'll go out of our way to make the effort to go back again.

The food was fine, but not nearly as good as we'd been told it would be. Perhaps it was the R-Week menu but we all thought the flavors were a little mild, the sauces were a little stock/tomato paste tasting and the flavored rices were not so flavored. Things just seemed a little under-seasoned all around. And, the famed beignets were frankly nothing so special that I'd go there just for them. 

Our main issue has to do with the fact that one of the people in our party had a dairy allergy and we alerted them to this when we made the reservation and again when we were seated and even saw a sign saying they were happy to handle dietary restrictions/allergies when we walked in the door. We were repeatedly assured it would be no problem as everything is made to-order, but it was a problem and a disappointment as the great majority of  things (even on the regular menu) were not feasible and desserts were impossible (save for a mid-winter fruit plate in WI which is never a good thing). If they hadn't been so repeatedly adamant that a accommodating a dairy allergy would be no problem, we likely wouldn't have been so disappointed/surprised."}
{"text":"Great New Orleans fare and not all the food is spicy as some people think. I know great New Orleans food and Chef Dave sure knows what he is doing. He has a way of blending food, herbs, and spices that make you want another bite, and another, which is what I want in a dining experience. I want food at a restaurant I can't prepare (or am not willing to take the time to prepare) and I can find it on the menu at Liliana's. Oh, excellent wine list from which to select as well; cocktails -the Bloody Mary should be listed as an appetizer with all the yummy garnishes- all are well crafted. Fish is awesome, steaks are great, great vegan and vegetarian options as well. I'm ready to go back right now!!"}
{"text":"Went to Liliana's in Nov. 2012.  It was a great dining experience.  The salmon and blackened catfish was excellent  The live music was an added bonus to the evening.  The service was also excellent and the selection of the menu has us anticipating a return visit soon.  Beth & Dave"}
{"text":"This place is a refreshing change for cuisine.  I enjoy the blackened catfish last night.  The starter dish of Oysters is heaven in a shell.  I recommend this place for an evening dinner, it has a nice ambiance and feel."}
{"text":"Love love love!  Tried this place for the first time tonight and I will be back.  We got the crab dip as an app and it was delicious and had a lot of crab in it.  They also bring you free cornbread and butter.  I got the lobster mac and cheese for my meal and it was full of a ton of large pieces of lobster.  And they were cooked perfectly.  Very good and way more than I could eat.  Beignets for dessert was a great way to end the meal.  Atmosphere was fun and had a live band but it wasn't too loud.  Service was friendly and fast.  It's a must go."}
{"text":"You know, I have eaten at Liliana's many times and they have some very good food but I don't know that I've ever had worse service than what my family and I experience last night when we *tried* to enjoy a meal. Notice the emphasis on tried. From the very beginning, the service wasn't great. It took a long time to even get some water, much less some drinks. On top of that, we had to ask 4 times for a children's menu. We never received it and instead got a brief listing of some of the items on the children's menu.

After finally getting our drinks, we ordered our meals. Our appetizers came out relatively quickly, as did the children's meal. Then, we waited. And waited. Then we start to notice food coming out to people who came in after us. Not only had we not seen our meals, but we also hadn't been offered drink refills. We asked our server what was going on. The first excuse was \"I'm at the whim of the executive chef.\"   Oh, so the executive chef is determining who gets food and not the order that people ordered?  Interesting. So we wait some more.  

More time goes by and we ask about our food again because now we're seeing people who came in 20-30 minutes after us paying their bill and leaving.  This time the server has no excuse or even an estimated timeline and instead offers us some drinks.  I would have even accepted a lie about what happened. And while I understand that people order different items and some things take longer than others, none of us ordered complicated menu items and that doesn't excuse having people sit for almost two hours without having their meal served to them.  Finally, as we approached the two hour mark, we all decided we had had enough and told them we wanted to pay the bill and leave. The server did me the favor of \"Drinks and Meals are on them.\"  Really?   WHAT MEALS?   If my meals are on the house then can I please have them?

So, we left and sorry Liliana's but you lost our patronage."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently returned from a honeymoon in New Orleans craving the cuisine. Sadly, Lilliana's did not deliver. The oysters we had were overpriced and nothing close to what we had in NOLA, which I get. Wisconsin is nowhere near the ocean. But the andouille-crusted tilapia and sweet potato mash served with it were both bland and not worth the price at all. The meal as a whole was overpriced and a major disappointment."}
{"text":"Ick.  Disorganized service, and genuinely mediocre food, at least by New Orleans standards, which I suppose are the correct ones to apply to a self-styled creole/Cajun place, even in Fitchburg"}
{"text":"I'd been having a long day when I made it to Liliana's for dinner. But then, in a shimmering instant of unspeakable beauty, it all got much better. The waitress came by our table, filled up our water glasses and said with a startling nonchalance that belied the grandeur of her statement, \"I'll just bring you some cornbread, m'kay?\"

How did she know? How did she know that cornbread was the answer? That cornbread at the end of a long day was like kittens to the internet? Like a hashtag to a hipster? A maque choux to a New Orleans fish dish?

It was a lovely start to a good meal. My entree was very good, but let's skip right along to dessert.

Beignets! I don't know what beignets are supposed to taste like, really, since I've only ever had them in Wisconsin, but I hope this is it. Because these are guuuud. Heavy but airy, doughy but lofty, sweet and full to the brim of the taste of calories.

The waitress came back to take them away and left us a card indicating that if we shared our anniversary  on the card we could have free beignets on our anniversary. We haven't set a date for our wedding yet but we made our best guess in hopes of some free beignets."}
{"text":"We were here for restaurant week/ my Birthday.  The cornbread was tasty, the steak was melt in your mouth tender and delicious, even the brussel sprouts were pretty good. The creme brule was very yummy! Our server was very good.  They forgot the kids fruit salad and vegetables and acted like they were doing us a favor when they were requested. There was a billing issue, that was quickly taken care of though.  Overall, a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch for the first time. My husband and I are Vegans so this restaurant was on our must-visit list. We ordered Tofu wings and Mushroom po bo sandwich( something like that!). The red sauce with the tofu was too sour for me and the sandwich was ok. We ordered a carrot cake and I am sorry to say but this was the worst tasting carrot cake. I don't know what was used in the cake but it left a very bad after taste. Can't describe it. Unfortunately, this place is out of my list. Albeit, I had huge hopes from this restaurant."}
{"text":"For my first visit to Liliana's I went for lunch.
I should have worked out that morning and perhaps starved myself for a week, before I arrived here. Delicious food, large portions. Not enough room!
Staff was courteous, polite and on it.  My lunch date and I ordered several items to share.
(note to coffee drinkers: they gave me my own table side french press)
We had the cheese curds- even for Wisconsin this plate was stacked so high of cheesey puffed goodness it was taller than the plate was wide.  We didn't even finish them!
Bowls of gumbo- I had to order the gumbo.  I would give it a B+.  It was good, but didn't blow me away.
Poor Boy Sandwich with shrimp: Bread was crusty and perfect.  Sandwich again seemed giant or maybe it was the cheese curd appetizer and gumbo that put us over the top.  I actually felt bad for not being able to eat the food. 
Had to ask for my left overs to be wrapped up in a happy to go box.
I'll make another pit stop here once I start training for a marathon.
Liliana's keep up the curd work!"}
{"text":"Located between a crematorium and a gynecologist's office, Liliana's offers some pretty alright New Orleans flavor to the Madison area. I had the mushroom risotto and my love had chicken diablo -- it's the pork that makes it devilish. Good cornbread, nice service, romantic atmosphere after the sun goes down (before that it was too bright). There was live music, a guy playing mostly Beatles tunes, but they gave us the option of sitting near or far from him. Far was perfect -- it was nice to hear the music in the background but not so loud that we couldn't hear each other."}
{"text":"A great find. Gumbo and smoked wings are excellent. Perfectly seasoned. Mac and cheese is creamy and tasty. Gourmet cajun food, how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere + some of the best fish ever. They've modeled the dining room after the French Quarter, going so far as to include a balcony and a working fountain in the middle of the restaurant.

I opted for the andouille-crusted tilapia, and I was not disappointed. I still think about it months after I last ate it. On the outside, a perfectly crispy, slightly sweet, savory and garlicky crust packed with seasonings. On the inside was a hearty, slightly salty, perfectly-cooked piece of tilapia that came apart in layers. I've always obsessed over my beloved \"chicken fish,\" so I was glad to go with what I like and see that Liliana's had done it justice. The sweet potato mash on the side was addictively delicious, and the julienned veggies pretty impressive as well.

Service may have been the fastest I've ever received, although I did come in on a slow weekday afternoon. We were in and out of there in half an hour."}
{"text":"So. I'm not huge into Creole cuisine. As a result, I enjoyed my food... but it wasn't anything I would ever seek out or crave. HOWEVER. The chef's daughter is quite possibly the CUTEST LITTLE THING EVERRRRRR. OMG. Liliana was sooo sweet, with her little doll, Kinki (yes... Kinki. hahaha) and her perfect blond pigtails. Yes, my extra star is purely based on this little girl's presence and I would totally go back to just to play with her (ummm. In my defense, I'm a future pediatrician). hahaha."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I really wanted to like this place. The atmosphere is nice especially for a date night. However, the food is not that good. The meat is often overcooked. The prices are expensive and it doesn't measure up with the food. The service was good and I have no complaints about that.

Overall, the experience was decent but the food was no up to par. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"REALLY good! We went here for apps and drinks and I can't wait to go back! We got Oysters Rockefeller and I got the Shrimp and Grits and a hurricane. Although it was very crowded when we went, it still felt intimate. The band that was playing added to the atmosphere, and our server was really professional and helpful. The menu may seems simple, but everything is expertly cooked. The amount of care that goes into the dining experience there really shows."}
{"text":"Graduation day and prom night. Lots of people. We were glad that we made a reservation a month earlier so we were able to sit down with no delays right away. 

The menu was mixed of common New Orleans Cajun style dishes with some vegetarian and vegan, options.  It's good for eaters of various needs. 

I liked their cornbread. I had the catfish po boy and it was ok.  I think the catfish wasn't blackened enough for me and it was a bit cold in the center. 

The wait staff were friendly and service was good."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here. Food is good, love the bands, and chief is very friendly."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Liliana's today during Restaurant Week. That's when restaurants are supposed to show their stuff so you'll come back again and pay full price. Nope. Not gonna happen. I had the pleasure of visiting New Orleans a couple years ago. New Orleans is known for its fine food (and plentiful drink). This place has no business calling its food New Orleans or Cajun cuisine. Fig and Brie bruschetta - barely toasted doughy bread topped with brie and cooked figs in sugary syrup. It was so sweet that you couldn't even taste the brie. Jambalaya with mushy rice and bratwurst or ring sausage for the andouille. Beignets for dessert. These were NOT beignets. Beignets are warm and they melt in your mouth. These were doughnuts topped with a lot of powdered sugar. I'm amazed that as you walk in the door, they display a long list of \"Best of Madison 2017\" awards. Clearly the voters enjoy a very Americanized version of Cajun food."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  I went here with 7 of my family members last May after I graduated.  We wanted to go to a place where everyone would have options and that wouldn't be too busy.  I'm so happy we went here!

It's an adorable place and they had no problems accommodating our large party.  They answered any questions we had quickly and kindly, refilled waters in a timely manner, and the food (for a larger party) didn't take too long.

Everyone really enjoyed their meals!  I think 3 of my grandparents (I had two sets there!) went with the Liliana Burger, my other grandma had the chicken salad po'boy, my mom and brother had the salmon, my dad had the etoufee, and I had the Vegan Seitan (which doesn't appear to be on the menu anymore, but they do have other vegan items).  I was so, so pleased with the seitan.  It was tender, flavorful, and came with perfectly seasoned vegetables and mashed sweet potatoes.  Everyone else LOVED their items too - seriously, they were raving.  Both of my grandpas (who are the silent-steady types, and use words rarely and efficiently) said I made a \"good choice\" for my post-graduation dinner.

I don't live in Madison anymore, but when I come back for visits, Liliana's is high on my list for places to revisit!

UPDATE 6/11/14: GUYS they have a new vegan/vegetarian menu and it looks BOMB.   Their seitan that I loved so much is back on the menu, along with several other extremely tempting dishes that I will be trying ASAP when I'm back in Madtown"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! I've had lunch here and two dinners and all three meals were exquisite. The chefs really know how to make the flavors complementary and the waitstaff are excellent!"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar and stellar food. Subtle live music to enlighten your soul. What else can you want on a hangry day?"}
{"text":"Finally tried out Lilianas after a couple years of wanting to stop in especially since me and my boyfriend are huge fans of Cajun food. Wish I would have listened to my friend who said it was overpriced and not worth it. I think that says it all. I ordered a mint julep and it tasted like straight bourbon, no complaints with a strong drink but if I'm paying for $8 for a mint julep I kind of want it to taste like one. Our server was very nice no complaints there she switched it out immediately. We ordered the shrimp n grits..meh nothing to rave about the grits were a little dry, there was some sort of gravy on it that was pretty good but just drizzled on and again $12 and the portion is smaaaallll. I ordered the shrimp creole and was very disappointed it basically tasted like Tostitos salsa over rice with some diced veggies. My boyfriend ordered the Lilianas pasta and again eh, nothing great, he's not a complainer when it comes to food and he even said it was missing something and the noodles were \"weird.\" The only part I liked was the complimentary cornbread with the jalapeño butter that was delicious but overall I'm a little bummed just because the bill came back at $70 plus tip and I left still hungry and totally unsatisfied. Again nothing wrong with the service or cleanliness but I definitely wouldn't waste my money again here."}
{"text":"This place does have a ton of gluten free options, which I love.  Their salmon is the best dish on the menu, IMO.  However, you really do have to realize it's mainly Cajun food.  Ie - spicy!!!!  I've tried a few other items on their menu, and they've literally been so spicy that I have left the restaurant hungry.  I would go back, but only for the salmon."}
{"text":"I love this place for all sorts of reasons.  Great place to meet people for drinks, stopping by quick for a pre-movie appetizer, or a really nice dinner.  Sundays kids eat free!"}
{"text":"I came here with a larger group, and the waiter (also one of the bartenders) mixed up the orders of two people who ordered filet mignon. The girl who ordered hers medium well started eating the one that was medium rare, cutting around the \"undercooked\" part, so the guy who got the dry-as-a-bone meat had to wait for another to be cooked off. It was unfortunate, but they corrected the mistake and offered free beignets to our entire party.

The cheese board was kind of pathetic. I had the jambalaya, which was pretty decent. The curds are just okay. I've been spoiled by The Old Fashioned. I got the creme brulee for dessert, and the crunchy burnt part on top was awesome, but overall it was just way too large and half of it ended up going to waste.

They have tons of vegetarian options, and the jambalaya with seitan looks so good. Next time I go back, I'll have to try out their dishes with seitan! It was an overall positive dining experience and I'd give it another shot."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! But make sure you're prepared for a hefty bill at the end.

Service has always been excellent and the food is incredible. 

Note: make sure to check or ask about the wine prices when the server makes a recommendation or you may just be paying $75 for four glasses..."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was amazing our server was friendly and knowledgeable and his recommendations lead to an amazing experience. The owner even came out and took time to shake my hand. I was very impressed with the entire visit."}
{"text":"This place is so bad, I hardly know where to start.  We chose this restaurant for restaurant week.  Me, my gf, and her mother.  The restaurant week menu always sounded awesome, so I was excited to try it even though I was a little turned off by the restaurant week price increase - used to be $25 flat, now it's $25-$35.  Anyway... I started off with their signature bloody mary, which sounded like a unique twist on a classic - it advertised some good stuff, like Carr Valley Menage cheese, but they must have been out, because I got some cheese curds instead...  The grilled shrimp was a nice touch for a bloody, but the overall consistency of the drink was just weak and watery - for $8, you better get it right!

I went all out and ordered the $35 French Quarter dinner.  Starter was a tuna nicoise salad.  Sad to say, the greens were in very poor condition, with many leaves wilted and visibly rotten - just not fresh at all.  I made the mistake of accepting the salad, and picked my way around the bad parts.  Let me just say that if a restaurant cannot even serve fresh greens, eating semi-raw tuna probably isn't a good idea.  I've got a strong stomach, so I ate it...  In hindsight, I should have sent the dish back immediately I didn't complain until the waitress came back to collect plates.  At that time, I pointed out the rotten lettuce left on my plate, and I explained that it wasn't exactly appetizing.  The waitress agreed and said she would inform the chef.  Fair enough...

The entree was something like a Gorgonzola and wild mushroom stuffed black angus rib-eye, with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes on the side.  Sounds great, but the first thing I noticed was that the brussel sprouts were a bit undercooked...almost fresh... Not a good start.  The wild mushrooms in the steak appeared to be maybe just creminis, and of course the Gorgonzola was overpowering.  I guess I was an idiot for thinking this would be a good choice, because if you've got to stuff a cut of meat with cheese and mushrooms to make it good, it's probably not a very good cut of meat to begin with.  This was definitely true of the rib-eye; it was as tough as a cheap piece of sirloin... Damn, $35...

Moving on to dessert.  This was a trio featuring creme brulee, beignets and chocolate mouse.  No complaints about the mouse, the beignets were nothing special at all, and the creme brulee is frankly, hard to mess up.  What really got me was the wilted piece of spinach that I found when I lifted the creme brulee dish off of the plate.  At that point, I almost flipped my lid because I thought the chef put it there to spite me due to my complaint about the wilted greens on the tuna nicoise.  When I confronted the waitress she explained that it was a \"gripper,\" used to keep the dish from sliding on the plate.  In any case, I thought it  out of place, very unappetizing, and a cheap idea that a better restaurant wouldn't even consider.

After we received our check, I felt even worse seeing the $140 tab, feeling it was about a $50 experience.  Given the overall crappiness of the whole experience, I was half expecting at least my drink to be on the house...nope...  Coincidentally, the manager decided to stop by our table to ask how things were - he apparently had no idea how we felt, or he wouldn't have asked.  Well, I couldn't resist telling him how awful I thought it was - he had pretty much nothing to say, and basically just walked away without addressing the issue - he was caught totally off-guard and I hope next time he asks someone he'll be more ready to hear what they have to say - with a manager like that, I'm not surprised this place is pumping out such low quality fare.  

So...that was my dinner.  $35 plus drinks and I can honestly say I've had better at Chile's, Applebees or Red Lobster, which you can interpret as a big ol' huge slap in the face!  My companions had the same opinion.  In fact, that's how I'd classify Liliana's - they appear to want to cater to chain restaurant clientele, and they have pretty much nothing better to offer.  Madison Magazine should think twice about which restaurants they allow to be part of Restaurant Week - this should be an opportunity for the best of Madison restaurants to showcase what they have to offer, at a spectacular deal to the public - I have continually walked into restaurant week with that mindframe, and I've been continually disappointed.  Madisonians should think twice about participating in this ever declining extravaganza.  Also, do yourself a big favor and do not dine at Liliana's.

Thanks for your time.  I hope you have found this review to be helpful, I hope you do not dine at Liliana's, and I hope Liliana's reads this review and makes some changes."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed! The cheese curds and shrimp & grits are my go to. Plus, the good cheer of Liliana and Chef Dave are worth it alone :)"}
{"text":"Trying Liliana's had been a long time coming. I'd heard consistently good reviews over the course of several years, so admittedly my expectations were moderately high. We came at 6:30 on a Sunday and there were about 10 cars in the lot. I was slightly disappointed outdoor seating wasn't open yet since it had been a beautiful weekend, and before we walked in, my often eerily prescient partner said, \"It feels like they're closed, just with a lot of people here.\" No one was at the hostess counter when we walked in- which did not bother me, but when I hesitated in ordering, (again, first timer) our server asked if she could give me a moment to think, thanked me emphatically, and did not return for 15 minutes. I wondered what was going on as I heard her offer dessert to our neighbors at the same time she brought out their entree. Drinks (including water) were extremely slow to be delivered; my martini was meh but I attributed it to personal taste, the hurricane a Category 1: watered down pineapple juice. I ordered the Pasta Liliana, which came dry, cold, and intolerably limp. His Jambalaya was also cold. As we left to go to Popeyes we watched our server explain how to eat crawfish with a vague motion and less than a complete sentence while turning her back on her way to the bar- and that's when we realized she was the bartender on top of being one of two waitstaff and seating and bussing her own tables. Who knows how short staffed they were in the kitchen but I sincerely hope putting the staff in that position is a rarity. Call me optimistic but I may try them once more just because this experience was so awful it can't possibly be indicative of the usual food and service. -Rooting for this neighborhood family-owned restaurant despite my disappointment."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week menus were extended for the rest of January. Boy, was I happy to find that out on their website when I thought I had missed a chance to try them out. The website strongly recommended reservations for lunch and dinner so I made a reservation. When we got to the restaurant (Saturday lunch), it wasn't busy at all and didn't really warrant a reservation. I didn't even mention that we had one.

I was looking forward to reminiscing about N'awlins. The music and decor put me in the right state of mind. The cornbread with the jalapeno butter was delicious. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits, blackened catfish po'boy, and bananas foster. I ordered the duck gumbo, jambalaya, and beignets. Appetizers were very good, albeit a bit on the small side.

My husband enjoyed his po'boy, only allowing me a taste of his tasty sandwich bread. I was like, huh? We laughed about it, but clearly, he really liked it.  My jambalaya was very soupy and not very appetizing. I packed up the majority of it in a to-go bowl. One day later, as leftovers though, it thickened up and was much better tasting.

The desserts were a let down as we found the bananas foster too sweet and the beignets only made me lament that I didn't eat more of them in New Orleans. The beignets were already saturated with oil and lacked the fluffiness goodness I so remember. 

Service was great though. Plenty of water refills and updates on when our next course was coming."}
{"text":"It's amazing. You can tell the passion and heart that goes into everything the chef cooks."}
{"text":"I absolutely love cajun food and this place did not disapoint.  Very Nice looking restuarant and the wait staff was really friendly.  Food prices were reasonable!"}
{"text":"I've always had wonderful dining experiences at Liliana's. During a recent brunch visit, I thoroughly enjoyed my shrimp and grits. I thought the shrimp were perfectly spiced and grilled. I appreciated they were fully shelled so I didn't have to create a mess with that. The gravy that's on the grits is truly amazing and I generally do not care for gravy.

Service was excellent during our recent Sunday visit, which is similar to our past experiences.

There was a man playing guitar, which made the experience that much nicer. The music was not too loud and complimented the atmosphere.

During other visits I have also enjoyed their extensive wine list. They do a great job with that.

I recommend a visit to Liliana's for dinner or brunch. The decor, service, food and music make it a unique dining experience."}
{"text":"Restaurant week.

Went here for an early Valentine's Day dinner and restaurant week special. Being gluten-free, I was dreading restaurant week--it's something we used to celebrate all the time, but I expected that this time we'd be out of luck because the odds of having a GF set menu are low. Because I apparently like making myself sad, I browsed all the menus, and discovered that Liliana's not only had GF options for their restaurant week selection, but MULTIPLE GF options. I was sold.

We made an online reservation which went well. Service was very attentive and pleasant, and we tried some great new wines. The food was fast and absolutely divine--I had a wild mushroom risotto that was to die for, and we enjoyed the desserts as well. (Added bonus: GF dessert options BEYOND flourless chocolate cake!)

We loved the ambiance and were very impressed overall. We'll definitely go again, especially since their normal menu has a vast array of GF options and awesome food."}
{"text":"I finally got to check this place out last Sunday, and  was disappointed.

My friends and I arrived around 2 pm, and sadly had to order from the brunch menu. My two companions ordered the Shrimp & Grits, and they both loved it. I ordered a standard breakfast plate with cheesy grits, bacon, potatoes and scrambled eggs. I found the bacon overcooked, the potatoes under-seasoned, the eggs too salty and the cheesy grits not cheesy enough. Everything on the plate was perfectly edible, but just not good enough to justify the $9 bill. The portions were also quite small.

We enjoyed sitting outside on the patio, and our server was nice and attentive.

I'll probably stop back again to try one of their lunch or dinner options."}
{"text":"The quality of everything I ordered here was awesome! 

My group had the calamari, corn bread, I ate Jambalaya and we all split a bananas foster for dessert. Everything was quite delicious, far exceeding my expectations. 

I would definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"We had been to Liliana's few times before and had good experience. This time it was different..
We were there on a Monday evening. There was another table inside, and few outside. Long story short.. we waited and waited at our table and did not get any service. I even talked to the person who seated us, but no one came. No waiter... no water. A waitstaff walked past our table to take care of the other table, others were cleaning the tables and talking,  but noone came to us. I am not a person who seeks high service, but this was just dishonoring. So we let the staff and host know that we were leaving... and went somewhere else. It ruined our evening. 

I really liked our previous experiences there. Probably bad day for us to be there? I lived in Louisiana for number of years, and was glad to find this place in Madison. We will be back some other time, and hope to get some Jambalaya served. :)"}
{"text":"Everytime we come in, Chef Dave and his staff, and sometimes Lily are there welcoming you to experience their hospitality, vittles and ambiance.  Great food!!"}
{"text":"very fresh ingredients , nice presentation wonderful flavors. I was expecting something heavier and I was very surprised. vegetarian options were nice to have I sat outside really nice and relaxing place gorgeous wine bar. 
I really loved the salad so fresh and yummy. it's hard to find good salads in Madison."}
{"text":"First time here.  The best food I had at a restaurant in a long time.  Everything was incredible and you could not ask for better service.  Our server Elaine was Awesome!!! Truly a hidden gem in the Madison area."}
{"text":"I think I may have a new favorite restaurant. Liliana's was very nice and I will definitely go back again soon.

Like Andy P. - we went on a Friday night without reservations. We waited about 45 minutes, but it didn't seem long at all. The decor is excellent and probably a bit nicer than we expected. Very impressive and good service. 

We also started with the Jalapeno Cranberry hush puppies - they were very good - but I expected a bit more Cranberry or Jalapeno flavor from them. Good none the less, but maybe a bit much for two people. (better for 4 or 5 I think). We ordered the Jambalaya and the Scallops for dinner. Both were cooked very well and were excellent. Probably the best Jambalaya I have had in a while. Only complaint was it could have had a touch more heat - I guess I like it pretty spicy.

Cost was pretty decent for what we ate and overall it was a great experience and a great value. They look to have a lot of special menu events and 'tastes' as well. Definitely a place I will return to again soon!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I have to say the food here is awesome and fulfilling! Our service however, was only okay as our waitress wasn't as attentive as we would've liked. 

We ordered oysters as an appetizer and I will have to say we could've gone for another order! The sauce that came along with it was perfect!  I had the mushroom risotto with chicken and it was jam packed with creamy goodness! My sister had the jambalaya and my brother-in-law had the e'toffee. Both equally delicious. They have a \"ghost pepper\" sauce that my bro-in-law added into his dish as well. If you like spicy....I dare you to add the sauce!"}
{"text":"We tried to call to order a simple lunch order to go for a lunch special for $10. We were rudely told they don't have it since forever by a \"lady\" , today on 02/16/15 around noon. We've ordered that special every other day few months back, so it was obvious they don't care about keeping loyal customers. Oh well. Thank you for showing your true service level."}
{"text":"Chef Dave's catering services at our wedding thoroughly disappointed us, and we have emailed, called, and met with him to convince him to accept responsibility in the role he had in making the meal a failure. He has sent us a small fraction of the refund we've requested and has been defensive in pointing fingers toward reasons why there were people who were not fed at our wedding. We concede that there are three things that we could have done to help him cater the wedding better: first, he requested pictures of the commercial kitchen which we never supplied (even though he never affirmatively expressed that he planned to use the commercial kitchen); two, we did not have a wedding planner; and three, a handful of our guests were the cause of miscommunication and chaos in the kitchen about how to carry out the dinner. To this day we're not sure what kind of preparation, ingredients, and care went into the food that was served on the day of our wedding, but throughout the process we didn't see evidence that anyone from Liliana's wanted to make our event a success. Chef Dave and Liliana's staff made a number of mistakes that were out of our control and beyond the scope of the effect of our mistakes that make us feel we deserve a refund: the invoice was four months late; the invoice was almost twice as much as our expressed budget; we worked with three different event managers; the event manager requested that we have four 8-foot tables which made the buffets look sparse; staff did not know how to pour beer and served drinks 3/4-way full; the chef forgot something in the parking lot and heated pasta in a large saucepan; the events manager did not use time wisely; staff had worked another event earlier in the day (even though Chef Dave said they only did one event per day); the MAC and cheese portions were half what they should have been; and as a there was leftover, uncooked food that wasn't made available to guests, among others. So there's a number of factors, mostly beyond our control, that caused the dinner to fail. We filed a complaint a month ago with the Better Business Bureau and he didn't respond."}
{"text":"I always have a pleasant experience here. We typically come early and eat in the bar area. The waiter we had was incredibly friendly and attentive. We ordered the cheese curds, shrimp po boys, and beignets. The cheese curds were light and delicious, the blackened shrimp in the po boy was cooked just right, and the beignets were hot and covered in a mountain of powdered sugar (as they should be.)

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Take one of Chef Dave's cooking classes!!

Chef Dave has to be one of the nicest and most outgoing chefs/business owners in Madison. He goes ABOVE AND BEYOND in his cooking classes. For 4 hours I was learning, entertained and amused by his stories, knowledge and cooking tips. It was SO FUN!

Not only is he a great chef, but while were in class he told us how he HANDMADE each and every table, bar-top and did all the tile work on the floor himself when opening the restaurant. How awesome is that?? He also talked a lot about the farm-to-table food that he offers and how important it is to him to sustain relationships with local businesses and farmers which I appreciate. He really wants only the best for his food and customers, which definitely shows.

The food is so great at this restaurant. I have been for brunch as well as a private party that I threw at this location. Everything was flawless and my guests were impressed with the food and service that we were given."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Close to home, and has a great New Orleans feel. We chose this restaurant to tell my in-laws I was pregnant. Will always be a memorable place! I really liked the alligator appetizer and the drinks. The e'toufee was delicious, could be spicier."}
{"text":"I ordered the creole trio, my father a noodle dish with chicken, andouille, shrimp and vegetables, and my mother a noodle dish with a smoked pork shoulder. All the food was great and had generous portions of meat/ingredients (even the noodle dishes). I've been to New Orleans quite a bit (used to live in Texas so it was only a 5 hour drive) and this place brought back lots of good memories.

Their cornbread/biscuits are also quite good and there doesn't seem to be much of a need to order an appetizer making it a fairly reasonably priced place."}
{"text":"It's great this place has vegan and vegetarian options. We went there for brunch as a group of 17 people though and they assigned only one server to our table to do everything. We had a reservation so this was just poor staffing on their part. Our server did her very best but you can imagine she was super stressed and could not keep on top of everything. They refused to let us move inside even though it was quite chilly. I used to work in restaurants and you need at least two people for a table that size."}
{"text":"This is, by far, one of my favorite restaurants in the Madison area. I love being able to run into the owner's family when we go there and it's just some of the best service and some of the best Cajun style food outside of New Orleans."}
{"text":"I was completely underwhelmed by this establishment. First, let me say the service is superb. Absolutely friendly, attentive, wonderful. 

The menu seems large but it just does not seem to have very may options. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich with a cup of soup and a white bean salad. The salad lacked any flavor whatsoever. It was served cold and just felt like slimy little beads in my mouth.

The sandwich was good. It was a twist on a traditional chicken salad. The bread was hearty, yet you could bite into it easily. Nothing great. The soup was ok but it had (possibly a cream or yogurt swirl) served over the top. Just not really for me.

I doubt I would go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful.  I went there with my parents and we had a superb time.  We showed up on a Friday night without a reservation and had to wait about 45 min, but they got a bar to do that in.  

The dining room is very elegant for a Cajun place.  I had the jambalaya and it was a \"wet\" variety of jambalaya.  The andouille was particularly smokey and delicious.  Loved every bite.  My mother had the crawfish etouffee, and my father had the bouillabaisse.  We all enjoyed our selections very much.  We also got a hushpuppy appetizer which was good, but probably unnecessary.

I have no problem giving the place all five stars.  The food took a while to reach us but when it did... yum."}
{"text":"Had the Wisconsin board, which was slightly different than expected (fried corn beef type patty instead of charcuterie, but then received more cheese than expected!). We also tried the Liliana's pasta, jambalaya, and seafood gumbo which were large portions, slightly salty but with lots of sausage! Service was a little slow in getting water refills, etc but overall enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"As a person with Celiac's disease, I want to recommend Liliana's to anyone who is trying to avoid gluten. They are very accommodating, have a gluten-free menu, and can practically make anything on the regular menu gluten-free with some small modifications. Since being diagnosed, I have been inventorying the local Madison restaurants that i can count on for a good gluten-free meal, and Liliana's is definitely one of the best. An added plus is their rather prolific wine list and the nice atmosphere. Thanks for giving the gluten-deprived a great place to dine!!"}
{"text":"Always great food and good wine. I am gluten free and the staff is well informed on the menu items and how to Recommend gf items. Also a great wine list!"}
{"text":"Had shrimp creole along with bananas foster with bread pudding!  Flavor and portions was what I expected. Ordered online and brought back to my riom, doesn't get much better then that."}
{"text":"Started off with a bang. The appetizers were awesome (steak bruschetta and loaded tater tots). The service for our large group was very slow.  Took an hour to get our entrees.  The entrees were just ok.  No one from our group raved about their meal.  Overall, disappointing."}
{"text":"After my first couple of visits, I wasn't a big fan simply because I don't like the peppers or jalapeños that are in a large number of dishes here. That aside, the food is very good 

I really enjoyed the chicken salad po boy and sweet potato chips. The salmon is to die for. My husband loves the jambalaya and gumbo."}
{"text":"Called for reservation after a Badger Game - only tables available were in the bar area, which turned out just fine for my wife and me.
Excellent food, excellent service.
Will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We popped int o Lilis on a friday evening at 8 and were promptly seated, which was great.  I was very impressed by their \"by the glass\" wine selection.  Sometimes you want to have a couple different wines! 

I had the Diablo Chicken.  It was good but not great.  We were warned it was a little spicy. It wasn't spicy at all.  The chicken was a bit on the dry side. My girlfriend had the mushroom risotto which was bomb.  Our waiter recommended that we add shrimp to the dish, and we're glad we did!  The dish had great flavor and texture. I would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"First of all this place has a friendly bar and very good live music to listen to. The bad is that it's loud in the bar and hard to have a conversation without talking really loud. Still, it goes with the club type scene and is ok.The six of us had dinner in a room that was out of the noise so was much better. We had an excellent waiter who was attentive and helpful. Our meal started with very good corn bread and an equally good salad. The food was another thing. The two cajun dishes were spicy hot but just didn't have the oh wow factor. The two steaks were just ok, and were not not hot enough but that can happen anywhere. The beignets were really pathetic. Dry and covered with the usual powered sugar they really missed the mark. Lilana's has been here a long time and seems to please lots of customers but it is not our go to place. Except for the music it's just not on our list of places to go back to."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the 2018 Mother's Day Brunch.

At Liliana's, you have to pre-pay for Mother's Day Brunch with a specific time and number of people. So we pre-paid for 4 people at 1:30pm. We arrived on time and expected to be seated per our reservation. But to our surprise, we were immediately asked to wait. They were still trying to seat people with 1pm reservations. The three hostesses were rude and unprofessional, insulting the Mother in our group about how busy they were and that \"everyone\" was having to wait. It might have been their way to \"console\" us, but it just came off rude, and it was some of the worst customer service we have ever received. We heard swearing from at least one of the hostesses in side conversation as well. At this point, due to pre-paying, we didn't have the option to find another restaurant. So finally, after 20 long minutes of waiting, we were seated. 

After being led to the dining room, we were dismayed to see at least 4-5 tables open. It took at least 10 minutes for a server to greet us. We found out that a server wasn't assigned to us. We were just lucky to have a proactive and kind server ask if we had been helped, and then helping us when we said no. We really appreciated his attention and service. 

We were by the buffet line, and it kept getting backed up due to a consistent shortage of plates. After waiting for new plates to come out, we finally got in line for some food about 45 minutes after our actual reservation. 

The food was the highlight of the entire day. A good variety of options from typical breakfast foods (scrambled eggs, potatoes, fruit, bacon and ham) to some southern dishes with a cajun twist (cajun mac n cheese, shrimp and grits, biscuits and gravy, jambalaya). The shrimp and grits and jambalaya were delicious. 

As the check came, there was a required 20% gratuity even though the service didn't justify it. All in all, it was a true disappointment. I would highly encourage people to avoid Mother's Day brunch at Liliana's in the future. 

It's hard to write this as we love the food. So I would recommend going during a slower service time and solely for the food. The food is what keeps us going back. Hats off to the Chefs at Liliana's."}
{"text":"Pros: 
- Our waitress was nice and attentive
- Fresh and moist cornbread
- Local ingredients and live music

Cons
- Drinks took an inordinately long time coming
- The food, while good, is overpriced

It's interesting and refreshing to have Southern flavors and dishes up in Wisconsin, but this restaurant - in my opinion - falls somewhere in between the categories of Southern homestyle cooking and upscale cuisine and doesn't quite hit its mark. 

The food definitely aims high and offers ambitiously creative dishes, but the jalapeno butter would have been better as a smoother, blended butter and the truffles in the bacon truffle mac and cheese were not really used to benefit or elevate the dish and rather seemed like a missed opportunity. 

The blackened catfish on cheddar grits, however, was fantastic. The spice blend on the catfish was perfect and all of the dish's flavors complemented each other well. 

Ultimately, this restaurant is just fine. It's just not for me."}
{"text":"Liliana's was great. We were able to score a patio table without a wait on a perfect Saturday evening (well, it was early evening to be honest-and shortly after we arrived the patio was packed!). Even though it's right on McKee, the surrounding trees kept things quiet and it feels a little secluded. Our server was friendly and prompt but did go a bit overkill on the upselling (I get it, I get it. I was a waitress in a former life but it was a bit much). Dinner came with complimentary cornbread served with jalapeño butter. The cornbread had a nice flavor but really would have shined if served warm.

We started with the oysters-they had one from the East coast and one from the West. Both were great and very fresh. My boyfriend ordered a cup of the gumbo but at the pushing, er, suggestion of our server, upgraded to the bowl. The bowl is HUGE and comes with a ton of Andouille sausage (per the server, the cup does not have any sausage). The bowl is easily more than enough for a meal in itself-easily the largest bowl serving I've ever seen-by a lot. The server did also sell it on the fact that it reheats well and that did turn out to be true.

I had Liliana's pasta which was good. The chicken on it just kinda missed the mark for me so if I ordered this again I'd probably ask for it without the chicken. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the red pepper cream sauce wasn't too heavy. My bf had the blackened catfish which he enjoyed but said he probably wouldn't order it again. I thought the grits his fish came with were awesome.

Top everything off with some live jazz and it was a very nice evening."}
{"text":"Overpriced and lacks in creativity and flavor.  Is it bad, no.  Is it worth my hard earned money, no.  Is it authentic, no.  Will I go there again, no."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but they had me at delicious and complementary corn bread and sweet butter. 

The Jambalaya is definitely the thing to order here - there are few things in life I regret  not having done, and not ordering this might be one of them.  Fortunately, my husband did order it and I got a chance to slowly devour the enormous shrimp, sausage, and seasoned rice in one bite before he took his plate back.

They make their own sweet potato chips as a side. 

Friendly wait staff, and it's a good place to take children.  We don't come to Fitchburg that often, but we might be back again for Liliana's."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I'd heard and read mixed reviews and now I see why.  We ate here for their New Year's Eve 6 course menu... so they had 6 chances to recruit me as a new regular, but with each course we became more and more disappointed and annoyed.

My first impression was that the atmosphere was great; music was fun, people were friendly and overall it was really well designed.  Everything was fine to start, I wasn't a huge fan of the amuse bouche, but nothing to hold a grudge over.  What started the downward spiral was the waitress bringing our second course, literally right after bringing our first course.  I don't like when anyone at a restaurant of this caliber says \"I don't want to rush you, but here's your next course.\"  Who wants to let their soup sit off to the side of the table while they eat the first course.  That was pretty much the way the following courses went, down to bringing our check WITH the dessert.  

I could go into lengthy detail about each course; including having to send back spare ribs (but the second one was really good) or the waitress and her lack of knowledge of the entire menu right down to telling us our dessert was peanut butter / chocolate when it was really peppermint / chocolate or that myself and others around us kept getting bumped into by waitstaff cause the seating was too close together ... but I'll save the time.

Ultimately, when I go out for a meal that's costing a table of two $200, I expect an experience.  Bringing clean silverware with each course isn't asking a lot.  Saying \"Can you keep your fork for the next course, I know that's kinda weird\" by our waitress is not what a meal at that price point should offer.  Kitchen paper towels on the counter of the bathroom is not the impression I wanted to leave with, but that's what I got."}
{"text":"Went on a double date, but the experience started days before we arrived. They have a great online reservation system, was very easy to find and request a reservation. One of the reasons we chose Liliana's is because they had a two-piece jazz band, and I thought that would be a nice addition to the ambiance.

Arrived and got seated immediately at a lovely four-top near the window. I don't drink alcohol but had the Bloody Mary virgin style, came with a nice collection of pickled things and slices of hard sausage. We ordered the deep-fried cheese curds and bacon-covered scallops. Both were delicious and I'd put these curds up to The Old Fashioned any day.

Before I went a friend warned me that the portions are large and that the \"half\" portion would be more than adequate for one person. GOOD ADVICE!

I ordered a half portion of gumbo, and my brother and sister-in-law got the full portion of the jambalaya. My husband got the dinner portion of the large scallops. We all enjoyed our entrees, but it really was the mac and cheese that topped the meal. We got one of the Wisconsin-shaped skillets of the most decadent mac and cheese I've ever had. Very glad we shared it, very rich but a nice compliment between bites of our main dishes.

The ambiance is delightful, tasteful with ample space that we weren't not sitting on top of other guests. The service was good too, attentive enough to get help when needed, but not hovering. 

Finally, I was pleasantly surprised by the prices. I found them totally reasonable. All in all, great experience."}
{"text":"How is there not a line out the door for this place?!?! The staff here is awesome and super friendly the music is on point just a guy and his guitar tonight lost in song and the food? Oh man! If you haven't been to this place yet you're missing out. I had the crab cake which was light and crispy with a delicious sriracha mayo followed by the best short rib Po'boy I have ever had in my life and the pecan pie was great too. Now I have to sleep into my food coma but I'm so happy I decided to come into this place and try the food. I'll definitely be back! Hopefully next time I can meet the chef!"}
{"text":"Great cooking class at Lilianna's today with Chef Dave.  It started out with an in-depth talk about how to deconstruct a beef tenderloin and the differences between a steer and cow loin.  The science behind searing vs grilling. Then into the commercial kitchen where we all got a chance to actually see and work with a beef loin and each of us dissected a chicken.  Which is WAY more than just hacking it into pieces.  It was amazingly easy once Chef Dave explained the different parts and the knife techniques.

Great discussions searing vs grilling, and we grilled the chicken breasts along with a sample of the beef tenderloin.  We seared the thigh/legs and made Coq au vin.  Of course we had to roast the chicken backs and scraps for broth.  

The hardest part of course was eating all the wonderful food we made.  No recipe cards, but Chef Dave shows you techniques that can be used for many different dishes.  I would recommend this class for anyone who would like to learn to be a grill master/mistress!"}
{"text":"Spot on every time - cooked to perfection and awesome (and innovative) flavors.

I absolutely love the Tuesday fixed menu.  3 courses, a new theme every week that each dish ties into (S'Mores, Beets, PG-13 (think Pork Butt), and only $25 or a little extra if you want to try the wine pairings that go with.  

The jambalaya is on the menu every day and is to die for - every time we think about going out for dinner that is what my boyfriend asks for.  

I just moved from Fitchburg to Verona, which means I'll be much farther away from Liliana's but I have a feeling I'll be making the trek."}
{"text":"It would be understandable if you were to drive past this restaurant, as the exterior is as unassuming as a suburban urology practice.  However, unlike a trip to the urologist, coming here is a lot of fun.  In my opinion, the food is B-plus level, but it earns 4 stars for ambiance and service.  My wife and I enjoyed the classic Cajun dishes we ordered, etuffe and jambalaya.  The dining area is classy without being stuffy, and the jazz band was good, yet quiet enough for conversation.  This is an extremely versatile restaurant;  it is appropriate for a first date, a dinner with your spouse or entire family, or taking one's Mother out for her birthday.  Clearly, contemporary Wisconsin offers more than just cheese curds, and establishments like this one go a long way towards proving that."}
{"text":"The cornbread was delicious, and I loved the jalapeño butter it was served with. The service was quick, and it would be a wonderful place for a first date."}
{"text":"We went to Liliana's for a pre-movie dinner on a Saturday night and was delighted by our meal.  The menu has a pretty broad selection of Cajun and Creole dishes, muffaletta, and then some not-at-all Louisiana Bayou dishes.  The best part is that there's an entire vegetarian menu!  I had the vegetarian jambalaya, which had seitan instead of andouille.  The texture of the seitan was a little bit unexpected, but the entire dish was delicious.  My dining companion had the etouffee and thoroughly enjoyed it.  

The service was great.  Everyone was friendly and attentive. They were very generous with the cornbread and honey-jalapeno butter.  Yum!  

The restaurant is cute, with some metal work and crystal chandeliers, but it;s in a kind of odd location. Perhaps that's why it was pretty quiet, but this was honestly perfect for dinner before a movie just down the road at the AMC Fitchburg.

Also, dishes come in half and full size portions.  We got the half sized, which is just about right for a meal...but I kind of wish I had gotten the full, so I'd have leftovers.  It could be fun to get two half-orders though.  They had a tofu and grits dish that I was eyeing..."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night with some friends.  The food was really good, a bit expensive for the amount, but hey it was worth it. The service was good and the food was too. There was a band playing and it got too loud to talk, but other than that it was a pleasant evening. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly atmosphere. Nice outdoor patio. Kid-friendly too!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Cajun food in the Midwest.  Gumbo, jambalaya, cornbread all excellent."}
{"text":"I have tried nearly every restaurant in the Madison area, and I can tell you that this is among the top restaurants to experience at some point. Despite its rather costly menu (expect ~$25 per person after tip), you will certainly want to come back. Their appetizer menu is interesting, diverse, and VERY freshly prepared. I recommend the fried alligator or fried cheese curds (best in the city) to start off. For the main dish, I recommend the salmon, although everything is good (I have tried the tilapia, jambolia, scampi, salmon, angus fillet, and catfish). They have a very impressive wine menu, which pairs well with their servers' comprehensive understanding of wine. Try to come in at a time when a band is playing. Service is a definite 10/10. No need to make reservations. There is Literally no possible way to complain about this place."}
{"text":"Food is great, ambiance nice.  However the staff has a discriminatory leaning, as it took forever to get served when I was at the bar with a woman of color while they fawned over the other patrons. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"Decent Cajun food.  However I would say the price for what you get is not necessarily worth it.  We waited a long while for our food and it wasn't even super busy.  The environment is good and the ambience is great, however for what it's worth, New Orleans Take Out or the old Bayou downtown has quicker service and in my opinion better tasting food. All in all, would return but wouldn't be first choice."}
{"text":"As usual the food is great the atmosphere is warm and friendly. The wait staff helpful and attentive. I celebrated my birthday with begnets. Thanks Chef Heide!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere!  One of our go-to date night locations.  New to the menu will be a lobster mac-and-cheese which was fantastic.  My favorite meal, their jambalaya, will stay on the menu and is a go to favorite for me.  Cheese curds are some of the best in Madison.  All around great place.  All the food is great there."}
{"text":"Lordy! N'awlins in WI. Lunch special cup of soup or gumbo with half sandwich or half salad ( doesn't sound like much but half is a LOT) plus a plate of sweet cornbread w/lucious butter for $10. They just don't offer sweet tea. Great service, wonderful food, jazz in background, lovely photos throughout. Deserving of all the \"Best of...\" awards for 2017! Wish this place was in Knoxville."}
{"text":"We went to Liliana's for lunch and were impressed with the nice staff and good food.  It was a little crowded but my food (catfish po' boy) arrived pretty fast and was delicious. Really good french press coffee with free refills was a plus.  Seems like the patio would be great if it had been a bit warmer. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Madison summer restaurant week 2017 experience: 

Love the outdoor seating with lovely flowers and guess what, they grow tomatoes here too! Amazing customer service. Our waiter was very friendly and funny. Huge portion. 

I chose the French quarter menu which was $35, one of the higher priced menu of restaurant week. 

Appetizer - Smoked salmon and fennel with herbed Montrachet crepe: I like the unique flavor of the herbed crepe but that was the only thing that stood out for me. 

Main course - Coq au vin with bacon and hidden valley mushroom with potato puree: When I said huge portion, I really meant it. Two people can finish this dish! The pork was very soft and moist but it was a bit salty for me. I like the flavor of the sauce but it wasn't very special. 

Dessert - Praline cream cheese torte with wild berry compote: Nothing above ordinary to be honest. The dish has a fancy display but its taste was just okay"}
{"text":"So I had high expectations coming here, excited to try some southern food in Wisconsin! Well, being from South Carolina I can tell you this is absolute shit compared to what you get in Charleston! 

I ordered the blackened chicken creole. The chicken tasted that of Tyson's pre cooked chicken strips that you'd buy at Walmart. Not blackened whatsoever. Ordered on top of some canned red tomato sauce and cooked rice. $18. 

I dipped the chicken in the red paste and tried to make haste of what I had but alas it was terrible. The waitress noticed and discounted me the price of the disliked dish. My friend order the diablo chicken and complained about the chicken being \"too rubbery.\"

We also ordered the buttery martini, which was yummy and the sangria. Drinks were good but food was under par for sure!! Do not recommend. I'd rather eat at Olive Garden or Carrabbas any day than here"}
{"text":"Great food, great appetizers and great atmosphere. Every time I've come here I've enjoyed the food and the service has been wonderful. I love the vegetarian options. And the quality of food is off the charts!. Amazing cheese curds and delicious smoked tofu muffuletta!  Highly recommend!  (Mother's day brunch was awesome as well)"}
{"text":"Had the $10 lunch special...oyster po'boy, came with salad or soup, sweet potato chips, white beans, homemade cornbread,  and a fresh lemonade. One of the best Cajun restaurants around."}
{"text":"The beignets were disappointing. The entrees were amazing, though, and the cornbread to die for!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there are all the haters. This place always amazes.  The chef is a great guy and the food is incredible.  We had our wedding here and just continue to return for the food and ambiance.  One of the best kept secrets in the Madison area.  If you haven't tried it, you should.  They offer an impressive wine list and will do any wine by the glass.  We get great service and food every time we come here.  The Lilliana's burger will stand tall against any gourmet burger, the smoked wings amazing and if you like spicy the Chicken Diablo........ One word...... Sriracha!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I was AMAZED. I have never left a restaurant feeling so satisfied. I had the Jambalaya and it was perfect; hot and delicious. I ended the meal with the chocolate mousse, which was also amazing. My boyfriend and I racked up quite a hefty bill, but it was worth every penny. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice motif and expansive menu.  This was my 4th visit and both the scallops and blackened catfish we had were dynamite.  Chef David does a fine job and is gaining a reputation in Madison.  A little pricey but worth a try."}
{"text":"I urge u even if u r not vegan, 2 cast ur conscience aside and lie and then beg them 2 make u the coconut peanut butter French toast with the rum brown sugar reduction.  Trust me on this.  Chef Dave premiered it 4 our brunch group yesterday and it was nothing short of orgasmic.  
Don't let the idea of it being vegan sway u ~unless u r vegan....then do!"}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the Cajun Cooking class I attended on February 28th with Chef Dave. Having never paid money for a cooking class, I was excited to receive this as a gift.

The classes are capped at ~10 people, and are held when the restaurant is closed between brunch and dinner service on Sundays. Chef Dave noted that future classes will be held at their new restaurant, Charlie's on Main in Oregon.

The Cajun Cooking class began around the bar area with Chef Dave and his daughter Lily. Chef Dave provided some base knowledge for Cajun/Creole cuisine, dispelled some myths, and explained the agenda for the class.

Once in the kitchen, Chef Dave demonstrated the various types of roux that recipes may call for. I'm typically scared off my any recipe requiring roux, so this was really helpful to see and smell rouxs in various stages of cooking. Then we observed Chef Dave as he walked us through three popular Cajun dishes: gumbo, etoufee, and jambalaya. We tasted the sauces for these dishes along the way to learn how to bring them from good to great and enhance flavors. 

Lastly, we all sat down together to enjoy a meal. After a starter salad, we were brought out a plate with a serving of gumbo, etoufee, and jambalaya. Chef Dave was such a wonderful teacher all around, and his daughter made for some good comedic relief as well. This is a really great experience, and it makes a great gift for anyone that enjoys learning about food and home cooking!"}
{"text":"Liliana's is so close by my house that I pass it up way too often and never think of stopping in.  That changed last night and I am so happy that I did.  It is a locally owned and committed to securing local ingredients wherever possible.  Dinner started out with a calamari appetizer as well as complimentary cornbread/jalepeno biscuits.  Both were outstanding.  The calamari was delicately fried and accompanied by a spicy aioli.  The bread was fresh and baked in house.  Both different types went well with the jalapeno compound butter that it was served with.  For our entrees, my girlfriend opted for the blacked cajun burger while I went with the jambalaya.  The burger was generous and perfectly blackened, coming out medium rare as requested.  The jambalaya was packed with shrimp, tasso ham, lardons, and chorizo.  Our server was attentive without being overbearing.  
Overall, we had a great experience and made me commit that I need to visit more often.  My only wish is that they had a few more sandwiches, etc. at a lower price point for the times I want to stop in for a quick bite rather than the entire dining experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with great service! Came here on a weekday evening with a group. Tried fried cheese curds. Tenderloin bruschetta, and crab cake appetizers. The tenderloin bruschetta was amazing; the beef was very tender. I am not a fan of blue cheese but it was well incorporated. Fried cheese curds were nothing short greasy and delicious. Crab cake was decent but I would personally skip it (can't comment too much on it because I recently lived in Baltimore, known for crab cakes). I ordered the scallops. They were nice and bitter and the mashed potatoes were well done. A very decent entree! Next time I would try the more authentic Cajun dishes though. For dessert I tried the beignets with chocolate mousse scooped over it. It was great. Bill came out to be a little pricey with everything but overall the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty and the service was well done. Coraline was friendly and helpful. We brought our our own wine, and were charged a reasonable cork fee. The Cajun fare (gumbo, jambalaya) was spicy but very flavorful. Desserts were simple and balanced out the robust main courses. The only food I was not terribly impressed with was the hush puppies (a little bland) stuffed with Gouda and the etoufee (tasted like heavily spiced jerk seasoning).

We reserved a table online, which wasn't necessary on a Sunday but was nice that I could do it online."}
{"text":"I think a solid 3.5 stars would be more apt.  I went for lunch during restaurant week but decided to order straight from the regular lunch menu.  I ordered a Grilled Vegetable Po' boy (Foccacia with grill-roasted vegetables, greens, Red pepper aioli, and herbed Montrachet).  

It was ok.  Nothing surprising.  The portabello was a little on the burned side.  The sandwich was dripping wet to the point it made the bread soggy.  I abandoned the bread halfway through and ate the rest of the veggies with a fork.  The cheese was great, but when isn't goat cheese great?  They did not have an advertised beer available - not a big deal, but always kind of a bummer when you get excited to order something that is not available.

My server was nice enough in a fake way, but the interactions between the three staffed servers bordered on loud and inappropriate.  There were only two other couples in the restaurant on this Saturday afternoon yet we waited to have our orders taken for more than five minutes while listening to them talk about one girl's bad date from the night before.  I'm sure the whole restaurant appreciated the story.  Getting the check and a to-go box took about ten minutes - hard to rationalize that kind of service when there are 3 people working in an otherwise empty establishment.

It might be fun to go back during a dinner when the place is hopping and maybe the dinner menu is better?  They seem to have some glowing reviews otherwise.  3.5 stars for a passable if not forgettable lunch."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for Sunday brunch and I loved it.  The decor is great, really very New Orleans like!  There was live music which was perfect, not too loud and annoying, just perfect with a guy playing guitar!  I had the sausage omelet which was perfect, I loved the chorizo, yummy yummy yummy!  My friends had the Jumbalaya omelets, I admit mine was better but it was still tastey!  The coffee was delicious!  Its hard to find a good rich coffee and this place was PERFECT!!!  I loved everything about this place!  The staff was great, attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"The crayfish etouffee is outstanding. The cornbread is nothing special. The lunch sandwich specials are a pretty good deal but frankly I'd rather go to Potbelly's. The atmosphere is cavernous and kind of weirds me out

I'll probably go there again since there isn't a whole lot of cajun food in this town but it's not my favorite spot"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here! The food is always amazing. I've tried many of the dishes and have never left disappointed. The service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. The waiter took our order without writing it down, and the food took so long to arrive that when it came out wrong we didn't have the patience to send it back. I hereby resolve that the next time a waiter takes my order without writing it down, I'm walking out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow, I absolutely love this place! I was visiting from Colorado and it's rare for me to have Cajun/Creole food so when the opportunity presents itself during my travels I take advantage of it.  This is now my new favorite Cajun restaurant.  The interior was beautiful, and the food was absolutely delicious. The leftovers were even amazing the next day!  I had the Jambalaya (best I've had) and Endive Salad (loved the truffle dressing).  I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Ever wonder why Lilliana's is 1/2 full on a Friday night? Wonder no longer.

We had last been to Lilliana's several years ago. It was meh at best, and the reason we hadn't been back. Tonight we went at a friends choosing. We are no longer friends. I am sitting here formulating my revenge as we speak. Why would a friend do this to us?

We arrived at 8:00. Our friends were already seated. The waitress was pleasant. At least we had that going for us. It was all downhill from there.

We ordered and were surprised that the waitress tried to shill us a romaine salad. Ummmmm There has been an alert out on Romaine lettuce for the last three days. The CDC announced that NO romaine should be consumed. Seems like a restaurant should know this, no?I mentioned it to her and received a solid shrug. 

Several of us ordered an \"endive\" salad. The salad came and was cheap greens with 4 small slivers of endive. Niiiiice.

Gather around friends while I tell you about the cheese board. It's a tale fraught with perils and adventure. 3 pieces of cheese. One that we guessed was Velveeta's new white and spicy \"cheese\" product. Also on the plate were two dry triangles. Toast points? Oh no. Here's where it gets scary. We all tried this substance and one bite was enough. We assumed after trying this soylent green-styled cake that it was chorizo and summer sausage thrown into a food processor and then formed into a brick, then deftly sliced into delightfully dry triangles. Also on the plat was an unrecognizable pile of slop. A couple of us kept pointing at it asking what it was. The owner of the cheese board was confused. I finally took a bite knowing full well what I was getting into. Why would I do that? It turned out it was rice and chorizo that was overly seasoned with cumin or file'. We asked our waitress and she said it was \"ko-ree-so.\" Good god...

My entree was the seared scallops. 4 quarter sized scallops sitting atop creamed corn, sitting atop 3 boiled and flattened potatoes. Served at room temperature. $21.

Beignets... Why one of our party ordered these after all that, I'll never know. Sigh... \"Beignets.\" These were obviously made with mass-produced dough. Cisco? Pillsbury? For shame... 

All of this took 2.5 hours and it took 15-20 minutes to get any drink. Every. Time. Remember the restaurant was half full.

The final insult after terribly slow service and horrendous food? A 20% mandatory gratuity for a table of 6. You bastards. 

There was a reason we took years to come back. There's many reasons we'll never come back. Ever."}
{"text":"We went to Liliana's last night for their raw bar night for the bridal party's girl night out and the staff and food were incredible.  They made for a memorable night and even though the restaurant was busier than normal, our waitress and the bartenders went above and beyond to make us feel at home that we never felt forgotten.  The head chef/owner Dave even came out to our table to greet us warmly and when our dinner took took longer than normal to come out, our entire table was treated with champagne and drinks.  The food was certainly worth the wait and is most definitely the best seafood in the Madison area.  I recommend Liliana's Restaurant not just for the food but also for the most welcoming service you'll experience not just in Fitchburg, but in the entire Madison area."}
{"text":"OH MY. OH MY! 

I couldn't wait to write this review. I just booked two return visits and both will take place in July when my family visits, but I went last night for a group meeting and 
5 stars for the grilled chicken wings & Mussels. 
4 stars on the cajun cheese curds ( i mean it's fried so it's good but the dip is BETTAH - no typo). lol  PLUS the Bruchetta. 
2 stars for the crap service. 
4 stars for the server's assistance, hostess and bar tender
4 stars for Liliana's growing their own herbs in the garden next to the outdoor patio. I know y'all think this is Madison-chic but IT'S SOOOO NEW ORLEANS AUTHENTIC. When I saw the sous-chef pull around to get something with his kitchen dirty pants...I wanted to be bothered but it warmed my heart so that I reminisced about getting home sooner than 2013. 

I hate patio dining because of bugs and heat. YEP! I'm allergic to the heat (no joke) and I'm from the place of heat. Of course, the bugs were fighting for a place near the dishes. We ordered Mussels, 2-order of Wings, Cajun Cheese Curds, The Veggie trays ( I don't recall but one had pita bread..I think it was their take on cruidte), the BRUCHETTA was lovely and I can't stand tomatoes. It has a pesto base. We also ordered BBQ Shrimp. It's not BBQ Sauce but Creole style with butter and a bunch of spices. 

This place knows to stick to the recipes and butter so it can't be wrong. But I'm trying to live a long, healthy life so I wish they'd lay off some of the butter and find alternatives but then it wouldn't be NOLA food. But honey....let me tell you.... those Grilled Wings got my faithfulness. You know how many times I have to eat 1 wing and call it a day or skip them altogether because they're fried?!?! 

The kid gave a thumbs up to the Kid steak. Said it was flavored well and decent texture. Yep, kid CRITICs do exist. The kid didn't care for the mashed potatoes and protested how did \"vegetables\" on the menu turn into just 3 asparaguses. lol. I told the kid - \"JUST EAT IT\" 

I'm choosing to bypass the discussion regarding bad service, but the food is well worth the trip. I look forward to finally getting some beignets one day and not from the Bayou (On Butler). 

4.5 stars for the Ambiance because the MUSIC and setup tries to replicate any street in the Quarters or Uptown. But it's more Claiborne versus Tchoupitoulas. The Courtyard isn't New Orleans-eque because it's Fitchburg..there's only so much he can do but I respect and appreciate the effort. 

Oh by the way..... a barback ran out to the Herb garden and pulled what I assumed was some mint. Man!!! you got's to love hard work and effort. To that end, I pray and hope my next two visits exceed my expectations or at least just come out the closet and say, \"EXPECT GOOD FOOD BUT SURLY SERVICE.\" That's okay. I've patronized and known a few establishments that lasted for generations under that mantra. Sad but true."}
{"text":"Though I have been to Liliana's a couple of times now, I still don't feel that I have actually experienced what Liliana's has to offer so I am definitely looking forward to going back and updating my review.

On my first visit, I was there as a vegan, yeah you read that right.  I went vegan for about a month or so and had the pleasure of trying dishes that I would not normally not try. On this particular visit, I have to say that I was disappointed by their lack of vegan friendly options.  After scanning the menu for a bit however, I was able to find the tofu wings.  Generally, not a big fan of tofu but def a huge fan of wings so I was interested in how it would be prepared.  The presentation was sort of lacking but I don't really know what I was expecting.  On my plate came about 6 strips of tofu in buffalo sauce.  It wasn't until after I received my dish that I decided to tell the waitress that I was vegan; at that she noted that the 'wings' had actually been fried in butter.  I didn't want to make a fuss and actually offered to keep it but she was so nice and insisted that they make me another plate, this time without the butter.  I was really impressed by how helpful she was.  

When I received my new plate, I ate the food and again, I don't really know what I was expecting but they were just okay.  Because they were advertised as wings, I was expecting a bit more texture but instead the tofu was pretty soft.   The buffalo sauce was good I guess :)  The meal wasn't all bad, the salad that I had to start was good and the date loved the etouffe that he ordered.  The table also came with cornbread which I was told was really soft and had a a great taste.

My second visit was on Valentine's Day.  This visit was also not a typical experience because there was a pre-set menu and unfortunately, none of the offerings were creole.  With that said however, I really enjoyed the meal.  There were five courses, all the same save the choice in entree.  It started out with a butternut squash soup, then salad, ravioli, and ended with a petite sirloin and chocolate mouse with strawberry.  Everything was delicious!  I really really enjoyed everything I ate and do not have a complaint.  The atmosphere was great and the service was outstanding.

I am really looking forward to trying this place under 'normal' circumstances and look forward to trying what looks to be a very interesting menu!"}
{"text":"We went here for a cooking class and, although the chef had good intentions, we didn't learn much at all. He showed us how to sauteed onions and frost a kings cake. After we were served \"the food we made\" and it didn't seem like more than rice topped with tomato sauce. We have been back twice since to try other things on the menu, but still unimpressed."}
{"text":"My group got there at 7 on a Wednesday and thought we'd be able to get a table since there were some open in the dining room but we had to wait for a bit. While we waited we ordered drinks at the bar where it took about 5-10 minutes to get 2 waters and a drink from their menu. When we got to our table it took quite a long time for the waiter to take our drink and appetizer order, but that could have been because we were waiting for another person to arrive. Overall, we spent 2 hours there, which is quite long for a meal. When the check came, the waiter had put our appetizer on the one person's check who hadn't eaten any of it (he didn't even ask, he just joked that he was making her pay for it because she was late).

The food was delicious, but since then, 2 people have told me they've been sick from going there so I will probably not be going back."}

1) gluten free options available 
2) slow service
3) good Cajun food

I had been to Lilliana's before, and remembered having a good experience. We had a city tin (Lilliana's is included in the 2015 pack!) so we decided to come back. We came on a Saturday night with no reservation and we were seated right away. We didn't have to wait last time either so I would say reservations are more of a nice to have than a need to have here. 

Outdoor seating is available and the space is a cute patio. Only negative here is your view is of Fish Hatchery Road, but overall still a nice outdoor seating space. 

The menu is pretty big with a large variety of southern style cocktails, appetizers and Cajun entrees. Menu options that are gluten free are labeled, but they also label options that can be modified to be gluten free which is really great. I tried the southern sangria which was very bourbon-y but good! You get corn bread with Cajun butter complimentary with your meal- sadly not g free but supposedly really good. We also had the Wisconsin cheese \"taste\" which was only $5 and perfect for two! Our entrees were pretty good, I had the Creole chicken and he had the gumbo. 

Our one major disappointment at Lilliana's was how slow the service was. There were tables open inside and out and it didn't seem that busy, but the service was slow. We were there for almost two hours and we just had one app, our entrees and one drink each. Not sure if since it was later they had already sent some of their wait staff home or what but we were really disappointed with the service.

Overall, good Cajun food, nice ambience but be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"The first time I was here, I got scallops. They smelled and tasted very strongly of ammonia, which is produced as they rot. Either they didn't taste, smell, examine the scallops for freshness, or they did and sent it out anyway. Not sure which is worse. Ordinarily, I would have given one star and never gone back. In their defense, I was part of a party of 20+ people, which I imagine is pretty hard to deal with in a small-ish restaurant.

However!

They have one of the most vegetarian-friendly menus in the Madison area. We gave them another try on a vegetarian night. We found the vegetarian options to be plentiful, well-seasoned, well-flavored. Dude knows how to cook!

Prices and service, are good. Ambiance is fantastic.

Bring your veggie friends there, especially when you're wanting something a little different from the token black bean burger every other menu has got.

Maybe the scallops were a rare accident, but the memory of the smell is powerful and I don't think I can eat seafood there again."}
{"text":"Impressive wine selection,as noted by Wine Spectator. Best cornbread I've ever tasted. Brunch is stellar with housemade beignets and bottomless mimosas. They make some rather tasty oysters Rockefeller. Service has been hit or miss, but I've had some very memorable evenings given the romantic decor. They often have live music, which helps reinforce the New Orleans vibe. You could bring your kids (especially enjoying the outdoor patio), but there is a general upscale vibe to the place."}
{"text":"I adore Liliana's. The food is always excellent, they focus on using local ingredients, and the bar tending staff always has wonderful suggestions.

If you're pressed for time at lunch, I wouldn't recommend them, as it's hard to get in and out in an hour.

They also offer a Tuesday night themed tasting menu each week, which is always fun, a Thursday night wine night with two wine tastes and two tapas, and many special events, as well as cooking classes.

One of my favorite spots in town."}
{"text":"Liliana's is tucked away on the edge of Fitchburg and is completely unassuming from the outside. We stopped by for Restaurant Week PUMPDIZZLED to see a vegan menu. Not every day you see this, people! The menu included: salad of carrots, tomatoes, radish and caramelized onion vinaigrette, entrée of blackened seitan with sweet potato puree and julienned vegetables, and a gluten free/vegan chocolate cake. The salad was straight-forward, but I enjoyed the vinaigrette- tangy and not too sweet. The entrée was tasty with roasted red peppers and perfectly sautéed zucchini. I could eat that sweet potato puree for breakfast lunch and dinner, jus' sayin'. The cake, however, was totally dry and I only had a couple bites. I get that gluten free and vegan is a tough combo, but figure that ish out before putting it on the menu.

We sat outside and listened to some awesome live guitar and singing. I would go back just to sit out there on a summer night, sip a drink, and watch the sunset over the prairie! That's something you just don't get on the Isthmus."}
{"text":"Brunch shrimp and grits and bottomless mimosa's at lilianas"}
{"text":"Fantastic. 2 adults, 3 kids, everyone loved it."}
{"text":"This place has really good food and really good atmosphere. For brunch, they said they could do most of the menu items dairy-free (not that I am, but I have a friend who is). The portion sizes are also pretty satisfying and I really fell in love with their crab cakes for some reason. I'm always excited and happy to eat here."}
{"text":"I can only rate this based on a single visit over lunch, but I'll definitely try to make it back for dinner (and more lunches!)  The complimentary cornbread was great (they're not afraid to load it with sugar!), and the lunch special sandwich w/ soup or salad is a relative bargain at $10 (or $11 if you swap out the standard soup for a cup of jambalaya like I did).  Shrimp Po'boy, sweet-potato chips, and a little bit of some sort of pasta salad-- Yum!  Service was great-- handled our large group great and even proactively offered separate checks which was nice.

We made a reservation for lunch since we'd heard that sometimes they fill up, but it was not crowded at all when we went on a Tuesday.

Looks like they're serious about accommodating gluten-free, vegan, or whatever other dietary restriction might be in style these days."}
{"text":"Good food, not as flexible on substations like making the crab cake an entree...which sounds simple. I can say I've experienced it and it was a nice nourishing meal."}
{"text":"Came for the first time tonight. Ordered the Jambalaya and the Gumbo. Both were really good with the Gumbo bring the favorite of the two. For dessert we had the beignets, 3 tasty treats for $4!!  I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, and every time I've been underwhelmed. Not that the food is bad, just that for the price and the atmosphere, I really expect more. I asked for recommendations from the waiter, and he recommended the three most expensive items on the menu. I ordered one, and my partner ordered another, and we were both disappointed with our food."}
{"text":"I am fed up with so many midwest restaurants calling themselves \"Louisiana/New Orleans style\" \"Creole style\" \"Southern Style\". It's no where near the real deal. It is a complete shame. 

I dined here a few months back on a Saturday evening. It was pretty late and the restaurant was about to close in a hour or so. This could have been my fault for coming later in the evening when the kitchen was so close to shutting down and not providing good food. Still, for a  $50 meal for two, I expect better. There was a live  jazz band playing. They were very good. It added some good ambience to the restaurant. Really enjoyed the music. Now on to the food

 My boyfriend and I were giving some cornbread with a honey butter as a starter from our waitress. I know corn bread and this is NOT cornbread. It tasted like Jiffy Mix batter and they added a bit more sugar. I've eaten all kinds of corn bread before, boxed cornbread, homemade cornbread even the class \"hot water\" cornbread, so I feel like I can safely say that I have a qualified taste pallet to rate  some good cornbread and this just isn't it.

The honey butter however was good. It would be proper to add it with a fresh loaf of warm bread. But I am of the belief that when you have a great piece of cornbread in front of you, you do not need to add more butter. The cornbread itself should have enough in it that all you want to do is indulge yourself into another piece. No add ons!

Moving on from the cornbread, I order this blackened cash fish dinner with dirty rice and side of I believe blackeye peas with various veggies in it including (collard) greens. My rice was very hard and my blackeye peas were cold. Again, maybe it was a mistake to dine there 1 hour before closing time. My rice tasted like it may had been scrapped from the bottom of the rice cooker and the dish ended up having pork in it which I do not eat. Knowing creole food, I should have asked the waitress beforehand if pork was used in the dish ,so that is of no fault of the restaurant, however, the hard rice and cold peas are. The catfish was blackended to perfection but it lacked flavor. No salt. A pinch would have done the trick. Overall, an extremely disappointing experience and is not in my opinion New Orleans style cuisine.

 If you were to take this restaurant and move it to New Orleans, they wouldn't survive. Due to their location, I think they stay open simply because they have no other local competition in the area of \"creole\" cuisine and some people aren't use to either cooking this kind of food themselves or actually experiencing  food straight from New Orleans. 

I really do not want to be the one review that seems to go overboard but I am very opinionated about this restaurant. I can cook better than what I was served. Sorry."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal Yelp user for a a couple of years but always hesitant to share my dining experiences with others.  After our dining \"experience\" tonight, the hesitation is over....

We had a Madison Originals gift certificate expiring, so rather than burning it, we decided that we would have a rare Sunday night out.  Their website indicated that Sunday was Family Night and kids ate free, so we were excited to check it out.  We got to the restaurant just before 6:00 and there were maybe 7 or 8 tables of diners.  We sat outside since the weather was nice.  Server was very friendly even though it was a bit odd that they didn't have any kid's menus given that it was \"Family Night.\"  

Our server was at our table promptly and took our drink order.  When our drinks showed up, I asked if there were any options on the kid's menu other than what I could pull up on my Smartphone.  Before I could finish my question, he ran off and said he would get us a kid's menu... 20 minutes later we now had a new server and a kid's menu.  Not sure what happened to the original server but our kids thought it was odd that he disappeared.

I asked the new server what she recommended for entrees and she suggested the tilapia, ribs, and jambalaya.  I order the tilapia and my wife ordered the salmon.  Our son ordered the mac and cheese and our daughter the mushroom pasta.  10 minutes later, the server came back and said the mushroom pasta was gone, so she got the mac and cheese too.

Around 20 minutes later our drinks were long gone and the server brought out the kids meals and said ours were on the way.  Kids asked for some ketchup, which never did show up.....

While our meals were \"on the way,\" the kids progressed to eat most of their food while we waited and waited.  Eventually our food showed up.  I thought mine was good.  My wife wasn't impressed with her salmon or risotto.  We ended up eating the rest of the kids mac and cheese and thought that was might tasty!

After about a half an hour the server finally checked on our table again.  We promptly asked for our bill.  When she brought it out, we paid without seeing the bill as the kids had to get to bed on a school night and we had already been there for 1.5 hours.  After a while, the wife and kids went to the car while I continued to wait.  The table next to us went inside to pay as they had waited long enough too.  After over 20 minutes, the server asked if I got my bill back.  I reminded her that she took it but never brought it back.  

Thankfully when the check and my credit card re-surfaced, it was actually processed correctly.  Had it been wrong, I'd probably still be sitting there....

While the food is alright, the service is horrendous.  Diner beware!"}
{"text":"Excellent Cajun food, and one of my favorite local restaurants that always has MULTIPLE gluten-free options available, regardless of the time of day. They also focus on using locally-sourced, seasonal ingredients, which I appreciate.

The staff is pleasant, knowledgable, and always kind about answering questions, whether they're about the food, good wine/drink pairings for their menu options, or anything else!

They can get busy, so I'd recommend reservations during traditionally busy times, but even that's a simple process (you can call, or make them online!)"}
{"text":"I would agree with the other reviewers...it kinda surprises you.
We went there on a lark....I had just defended my Ph.D dissertation and we wanted to go celebrate somewhere nice but still keep it casual (I was wearing checkered shorts!) Of course, I had read reviews on yelp earlier :-)

The ambiance is very romantic...especially when it's dark outside and the lights inside go on. The service was very attentive but not intrusive.
The wine we ordered for the table (recommended by the waiter) was very good...so was the cheese plate....which, btw, was plentiful...with crostini and 4 kinds of mustards...for $10???...hello, that's cheap!!...and how could i forget...the complimentary corn cakes were so good I asked for seconds :-)

I had the Creole trio....which allowed me to try their 3 main cajun/creole entrées...jambalaya, Étouffée, and gumbo. Now keep in mind that this was my first introduction to cajun/creole food.....i would say the food was good but not exquisite....all the 3 seemed to give me similar flavors...especially the gumbo and the Étouffée.....now that maybe how it's supposed to be...but since they were being served together, they should have been more \"unique\"....but nonetheless, it was yummy!

Take ur wife here on a romantic date and she won't be disappointed....also plenty of nice window seating and not very crowded....thats a plus...although a crowd does add to the \"feel\" of a place....but, i can't complain....we were there on a monday night at 8.30...so we missed the jazz pianist that people talk about i guess :-("}
{"text":"Tried Liliana's for the first time yesterday, since we've had a coupon on the fridge forever for free baguettes.

The decor inside was exceptional.  It was very New Orleansesque, complete with streetlamps and beads hanging overhead.  There's also some cool photography that the owners took themselves.

They start you out with cornbread, which by the way, was phenomenal.  Let it be known that I'm a sucker for good cornbread and haven't had it in awhile, so that alone made my visit.  I'd be happy to go back to this place for drinks and a bit of the spongy stuff.

For appetizers, went with calamari.  Not the best that I've had, as it was fairly tasteless. A spritz of lemon and lime helped out.  Neverless, we polished the plate off.

The one downside of the visit was the wait once our food was in (similar to other reviews).  I wouldn't have expected our order to take as long to bring out, as it ended up being roughly an hour or so between ordering and receiving our food. Minus 1 star.

The food made up for it though. The tilapia was done well, falling apart when I tried to pick it up.  No knives required!  As a bonus, it was on top of sweet potato mash, which competed for the top taste of the day.

There was also some outdoor seating, but considering it was rainy, windy, and 34 degrees...we passed.  Could be worthwhile when it's a bit balmier out."}
{"text":"Lilliana's in Fitchburg, WI
I should start this review with my bias. I am a huge foodie, food advocate, and eater! I get an amazing rush when I eat good food and I do believe you can get great food at Lilliana's! It's delicious and no on can take that away from them. 
Now, when I am reflecting on my most recent experience at Lilliana's, I know that there is no level of good food that could make me set foot into this restaurant again. Let me tell you what happened...
So my husband and I went out for brunch about 3 days ago. We decided to go to Lilliana's because when we were there for dinner Friday night, the waiter (who was great) talked up the brunch menu. So it is Sunday and we are seated against a window. There are several other guests, some eating and some not. It takes a bit meet our waitress which I now know was because she had gotten slammed with 5 tables all by herself at once. It wasn't a problem but by the time we got our food we knew something g had changed. I noticed she was attending to other tables multiple times without attending to us. I actually had to go fill up my water as a bus boy came by. I then had to go behind the bar to get more ketchup because NO ONE WAS HELPING US! I usually don't do this, but I got up for a third time to asked the waitress if she could help us. She told me she was letting us eat and did not mean anything by it, but when no one came again for us to pay for our meal, I knew this just wasn't right. I asked to speak with a manager because I was the only person of color there and I was the only person not being served--believe me, I looked. I had enough! The manager told me he would check the security tape and get back to me. He took my contact information and I left. 3 days later and I still am yet to hear from him. Whether it was racism or not, the behavior was unacceptable and the follow through was non-existent. I'm through!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp...in the area for a business trip.  Holy crap!  This place has some of the best Cajun food I've ever had.  I did a split entree of Jambalaya and Etouffee...both were amazing!  My boss had the Chicken Diablo and said it was \"ridiculously good\". We also split the cheese curds and cornbread...all 5 star goodness!  

No doubt when we travel back to this area, we WILL be going to Liliana's"}
{"text":"Great location and decor! A group of friends and I went here on a Saturday afternoon around 1 PM for lunch (they only have brunch on Sundays, so be aware of that!), and we were not disappointed! 

Many of us got the Blackened Catfish Poboy, which was fantastic. I'm not even that big of a fan of creole/NOLA style food, but I really enjoyed the fish and the bread. The complimentary cornbread was also super appetizing! One of my friends enjoyed a gluten-free sandwich, commenting that it didn't fall apart as easily as most gluten-free sandwiches do, so I think this would be a great place to go if you need to eat gluten-free.

Overall, the service was surprisingly slow given that we were the only group there aside from another party of two. I've heard great things about this place for dinner, so I plan on coming back for that! I would definitely recommend this place if you've been wanting to try out NOLA-style food!"}
{"text":"Why have I waited so long to come check this place out?! 
Food was very pretty & absolutely delicious. 
The service was great. Very friendly. 
Super excited to see multiple vegetarian options on the menu. 
Totally recommend."}
{"text":"Great place for food and drinks. Good atmosphere and it's a place that has something for everyone. I really like the smoked tofu wings (I don't think that these are on their official menu) and the crudites for snacking. These are two awesome apps to have along side a Pat O'Brien or a Liliana (two of their delicious cocktails). They do have a daily HH that offers both appetizer and drink specials. I think my next trip will include dessert first. I need to try their beignets. This place does come close to NOLA food. The touch of music in the background is really nice during the meal."}
{"text":"I've visited Liliana's twice in the past 6 months, once for lunch, once for a special occasion dinner.  While I did enjoy my lunch experience, the restaurant delivered a disappointing performance for my anniversary dinner where the lackluster food and service just did not jibe with the high price tag.

During my lunch foray, I ordered the fried shrimp po'boy, the tomato bisque, white bean salad, sweet potato chips and a slab or cornbread as part of the $10 lunch special.  Given that the po'boy normally goes for $13, the lunch special is a decent value if you come hungry.  Other than the pedestrian bread, I felt the sandwich was well prepared.  The well-seasoned fried shrimp, which came with a tempura-like coating, were a bit awkward to consume, given their gargantuan size.  For a restaurant serving Cajun-inspired cuisine, the spice level was quite mild.  The tomato bisque packed a surprisingly pleasant punch of tomato flavor.

Our amiable server made a conscious effort to engage with us and my dining companion and I enjoyed our banter with her.  The pace of the meal was very slow for a lunch service and we had to flag down our server a couple of times to see to find out the status of the next course.  The leisurely lunch works doesn't work too well during the work week if you need to squeeze a lunch into a 60 minute time slot.

My recent Friday night dinner experience did not go as well.  We didn't have reservations, so rather than wait an hour for a table in the dining room, we elected to eat on the patio.  No one wiped down the table after its previous patrons departed, so we did the best we could to clear the debris - not an auspicious way to start our meal.  

There was live entertainment in the bar and the patio speakers allowed us to enjoy the act (it was a bit loungey - think 'Girl from Ipanema' type of tunes, but the performers were talented, so it added an enjoyable backdrop to our meal).

Our server, who conveniently arrived after we wiped down our own table, tried hard, really too hard, to engage us by feigning a familiarity that did not exist. It made for an awkward experience throughout the meal.  My wife was put off by his efforts to help her navigate the wine list, which frustratingly did not list the country / region of origin.  After a couple minutes of spinning her wheels, she gave up and ordered a beer.  

One of the reason I decided on Liliana's was the cheese curds, but alas, no cheese curds for us, the restaurant was completely out.

We then decided on the cheese board ($17), which offered 6 Wisconsin cheeses, crostini, candied pecans fresh fruit and mustard.  When the board arrived, our server provided a cursory list of the cheeses, not indicating the provider or whether the cheese was cow, sheep or goat. (Other than the fact the cheddar came from Hook's).  The fresh fruit consisted of two semi-ripe strawberries and the candied pecan were nowhere to be found.  The pungent mustard was excellent, but the crostini was extremely dry and crumbled into pieces when we attempted to bite into it.  While the kitchen was generous with the portions, none of the cheeses where memorable other than the cheddar and the Gouda.  When I asked about the candied pecans, our server kind of blew me off, saying that the kitchen must have forgot to place them on the board.  I understand the kitchen may run out of ingredients, but it would be nice if the server would mention that when delivering the dish and asking if something else could be substituted in its place.

The next small plate we sampled was the brie bruschetta.  While I enjoyed how the jammy goodness of the fig & pear compote paired with the creamy brie, my dining companions did not share my enthusiasm.  My biggest complaint is the lackluster bread.  While it had a couple of grill marks for texture, it needed more toasting to handle all the moisture from compote, and became a soggy mess soon after it was delivered.  And in a town with so many fantastic bakeries, I was disappointed in the spongey, bland bread that lacked any substance. 
My daughter order ended up ordering the Wisconsin mac & cheese, served up in a cast iron pan in the shape of Wisconsin.  While impressed with the ingredient list, I expected a creamer rendition of this classic.  Sadly, a puddle of watery cheese sauce prevented the cast iron from caramelizing the ingredients on the bottom of the dish.  I really expected more richness from this meal, which was overpriced at $17.

I expect I will not return to Liliana's for dinner, as there are so many better local option in this price point (Brasserie V, Sardine, Heritage Tavern to name a few) that offer more consistent execution of their food and service. However, given the proximity to Liliana's to my workplace, I do expect to return for an occasional lunch when my schedule gives me enough flexibility for an extended break."}
{"text":"Great cheese curds! The service was great. Lots of vegetarian options! It was a tad spicy for my taste but that's because I'm a wimp. But I would go back."}
{"text":"Finally, a place with unhealthy vegetarian food! I am so there! I went for lunch and got the tofu wings appetizer. The batter is very light, almost tempura style and the tofu has a nice smoked flavor to it. The dish came with a hot sauce and bleu cheese dipping sauces allowing for the diner to decide how much heat they would like with each bite. These are the best tofu wings I have had in the Madison area and they are very hard to find in the Midwest in general! However, I still think the price point is a little steep, but apparently they are 1/2 off during happy hour - this I will most definitely be exploring! The dish also was served with celery and carrots. 

For the main I chose the fried shrimp po'boy. The shrimp were large and had the same light batter as the wings. The bread was really spot on with the crunchy exterior and solid sourdough flavor. The additional onions, tomato, and lettuce were also very fresh and added some good brightness to a heavy dish. The sides were sweet potato chips and a pearl couscous pesto salad. Neither of the sides really blew me away, but I had more than enough sandwich to satisfy. 

The service here was efficient and very friendly. Even with the tiny water cups the server managed to keep quite a few crowded tables well quenched. 

This spot is worth venturing out to. I definitely would like to return here for the $10 lunch deal or for happy hour to try some of their other offerings and some of their signature cocktails."}
{"text":"Think meetings suck?
Think they're not productive?
Yelp Elite Rowan C is queen of awesome meetings, seriously, we get so much done and have a great time gabbing.
When she heard I had never been to Liliana's she decided a mid-week visit was a must! We decided to split a french press which was decent, but the temperature of the water wasn't hot enough and I'm guessing the grounds were a little too fine because many made it to my mug and created a pretty bitter sludge. The bananas foster fared a bit better, although sort of a small portion for eight bucks. Rowan's pecan pie was tasty, albeit a touch on the sweet side. (I realize pecan pie is essentially nuts/crust/sugar/egg...sweet...but a dash of salt of something spicy like nutmeg or ginger can really cut the cloyingly sweet taste that lingers.) I want to head back and check this place out for a more substantial meal but I'd probably pass on dessert."}
{"text":"We've lived near here for 18 months and have never gone in. To be honest we didn't even know what kind of food they served until recently. 

So Fat Tuesday rolls around and we decide we'll go to the cajun/creole place down the street, and what a surprise! The interior is very nice, there was a live band and the food and drinks were great! 

We both had the tomato basil soup---definitely rich and seemed to be made with quality ingredients. Then we had the cajun cheese curds----some of the best we've had in Madison (and that's saying something). 

For the main course we split the Jambalaya. This was our only disappointtment. We asked for it to be extra spicy---and found it to be barely spicy at all. But spice can be a hard thing to rate and we both love spicy food so we aren't the best judges. There also wasn't much rice in the jambalaya----which most people probably prefer. But there was TONS of meat---shrimp, bacon, sausage, etc.. 

The cocktails were also fun. My husband tried the traditional Sezerac and I had the Pimm's Cup. Both good! We plan to go back and give it another go with the spice-factor."}
{"text":"We just had a large work party here for lunch, and many people commented on how much they like the food.  Service was a little slow but, we were a big group.  They had run out of a few lunch special menu items, that was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Ok, time to update my review of what was once my favorite restaurant. Unfortunately it has taken a turn for the worse. Now, don't get me wrong. The food is still great, but we have had some pretty bad service the last couple of times we've been there.

The last time was three weeks ago, for Sunday brunch. It wasn't terribly busy, with lots of empty tables. We were in a group of ten,  with six adults and four kids, including a two year old. 

We ordered drinks, appetizers and main courses. It was a speedy brunch.

We ordered several bottomless French press coffees, bottomless mimosas. Getting them refilled was like pulling teeth. Even our water glasses ran dry. 


The food took a very long time to arrive. When it did, the kid's meals came out last. 

When the appetizers came out, we asked for some refills and a few additional beverages for the kids. It took a while but eventually we got the refills, but then after the food arrived we had to remind her about the kids drinks.

The waitress did not stop by to ask how we liked our food. (It was delicious, if delayed.) Had she done so we could have used the opportunity to get some drink refills.  Our dinner companions even commented somewhat loudly how great it would be if they could get some more coffee while they he waitress was in earshot. Nothing.

In the end, we got our bills (one for each of the three families at our table) and found that we had each been charged a 20% gratuity.

Things seem to be a bit more hit or miss at Lilliana's. The experience we used to have and rave about seems to only occur when Chef Dave is there. Unfortunately that is a lot less often than it used to be."}
{"text":"Have been two times and it was really good both times. The Diablo chicken was very very tasty and the cornbread appetizer was awesome. Their cheese curds are really good; I would compare them to the old fashioned. Ambiance was a little weird, I felt like they were trying to be too swanky, but maybe I just prefer more casual down n dirty Cajun places. 

Good for groups too. Went with a party of six or seven and didn't even have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"It was pointed out to me, as I was talking about how bad the last few trips were, that I still had this at 5 stars.

The spectacular service that I had been used to has gone away.  The service for the last 3-4 visits was bad at best.  The food seems to have suffered as well; little things being missed, degradation of quality and consistency.

To be truthful, I am not sure I'll ever be back at this point.  I have been frequenting a better Cajun place in the area and they are more personable and take a higher level of pride in their food.  Not to mention they are way less expensive."}
{"text":"The food was really good.  My husband had the Bouillabasse and he thought it was excellent.  I had the shrimp scampi and I enjoyed the different seafood as well as the sauce had a little spice (which I liked).  The kid's mac n cheese was good too.  We had some raw oysters and the waiter Brian helped us pick 3 different kinds to try.  It was Sunday night family night so our daughter ate for free and they had $4 Sangrias which were good.  We decided to have dessert, the creme brulee was great and the chocolate mousse was excellent.  It was not a cheap meal but we thought the price was good for all of the courses we had.  We sat outside which was really nice.  We will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is nice. Live music, good wine list, food is pretty good. I had the Louisiana pasta. I wasn't extremely blown away but it was pretty good. The beignets are of course amazing. Service is good. You can tell the servers are trained well. 

Negative points for Best of Madison being thrown in your face everywhere you go. Sign in front grass, sign in the foyer when you come in, sign in the bathroom, sign on the menu, all begging for votes. Does it really count if you are doing that? Super tacky in my opinion. 

I would normally give a 4 because it was good but I wasn't blown away, but am giving 3 stars for the tacky Best of Madison everywhere."}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away. I had a tap beer, which was fine,  but this definitely wasn't New Orleans Cajun. The corn bread and jalapeno butter was tasty, but the crab cake was mushy (more bread than crab) and didn't have a great flavor. I had Liliana's pasta, which was pretty bland. It needed a little more sauce, and I had to give it a healthy dose of salt and pepper to bring it to life. In spite of this, the service was solid and I enjoyed the live music. Bottom line, I probably won't go back next time I'm in the area, as nothing stood out in terms of the food."}
{"text":"So delicious and lots of good options. The appetizers are varied and well-portioned. The sandwiches are so good and the entrees range from reasonably healthy to downright indulgent. The live music is just the cherry on top!"}
{"text":"My husband just took me to Liliana's this past Sunday for my golden birthday! (I turned 28 on the 28th :) It was so great. A few years ago, we went to New Orleans and I had a very difficult time finding things to eat that weren't covered in slabs of oil and bread crumbs, so finding a cajun place with a fantastic vegetarian/vegan selection sent me over the moon.

On a Sunday night right after Christmas, it was pretty empty, but a friend said it's usually packed. Our service was just okay -- our appetizer was obviously forgotten and came out with our food and getting to us initially took a while. But they made up for it with a free dessert and champagne!

I had the mushroom po' boy without blue cheese (provolone instead) that also came with a white bean salad and these beautiful, delicate sweet potato swirls. They were so fresh and light, I LOVED them. The white bean salad was also excellent and I wish I could get a scoop of it for work! The sandwich was tasty, especially with the crispy bread, though I think the flavor was a little muted for me since I got provolone instead. It was missing something to give it a special kick ... but I truly despise blue cheese.

We ordered the veggie tots for an appetizer, but they came with the meal. We also didn't get the corn bread & jalapeno butter until the meal. Both were SO yummy.

For dessert, they came us a free creme brulee, and then we ordered the almond cake to take home.

The part that impressed me the most was after all of that food, I didn't feel overly full or gross. I felt like I could run around the parking lot even! It wasn't that portions were insanely small or anything, either. Everything just tasted fresh and like the chef really knows how to balance spices and fried stuff.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time. Went for brunch but I definitely want to come back for that truffle lobster Mac and cheese. Arrived right at 10am. Started filling up about the time we left and that was around 11am. 

Decor is really nice. Very clean and bright. The tables were decorated with a bright flower and candle. 

I ordered the crab cake Benedict and my wife had the Liliana breakfast. Also ordered some beignets and some colorful drinks. Delicious drinks. Brunch was very good!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place! They have many vegetarian and vegan options, and live music adds to a fun ambiance. Unfortunately the tofu was not well seasoned or cooked, and when my friend said as much to our server Bryan, he rudely replied \"yeah I would never order that.\" And \"it's tofu, that's pretty much as good as it gets.\" No apology, just attitude. Sorry Bryan, I can make better tofu at home and will next time I'm thinking of coming to Liliana's."}
{"text":"Have eaten here on multiple occasions in the past year when traveling for work. Tried the Jambalaya to go (see my original photo) and on my next trip hit up the bar for some Abita on draft and an excellent Blackened Catfish.  The dish's presentation was a welcome surprise and added to the taste as the drizzled on red paste wasn't just for looks but was a spicy creole meuniere."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant.  The hurricanes are really good.  The food is flavorful.  I really really love the shrimp and grits.  If I lived closer to Fitchburg, I would go once a month on top of the 4-5 times a year I already go.

I recommend this fun spot off of Hwy PD."}
{"text":"Pretty good Cajun food. They can make a good drink. Their menu is standard Cajun. The beignets are amazing!! Still Id go to Louisiana's Etc in Middleton."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend ordered the salmon and really liked it, I ordered the fried shrimp po boy and HATED it. Omg it was nasty, everything that was on my plate was no good. I'm very picky so i tried going with something that I was familiar with... The fried shrimp were barely fried, shouldn't have even called them that and they were VERY rubbery.. On top of that they were massive. I mean the shrimp were huge.. So just imagine taking a bite into a sandwich and eating a half fried giant rubber shrimp. I couldn't even eat it. I moved on to the chips hoping i could eat something on the plate, but no. They were chewy?! Why? Maybe that's how they were suppose to be and I'm just so out of tune with what's going on.. But I didn't eat those either. My boyfriend did however because the small portion of salmon on his plate left him still hungry. You think for $18 you'd be able to get full. Anyways I'm not going back just off that one experience. I think I'll pass. Out was that bad. For the price (expensive) I should have loved everything. Oh yea we also had the cheese curds, once again disappointed. Greasy and no flavor. I love cheese curds and being from Wisconsin I know a good one when I eat it and they definitely weren't up to par. I'll pass"}
{"text":"Very salty. I was here 3 years ago and the food was good. However, I was very disappointed about tonight. The scallops were fishy and the risotto was extremely salty. I asked someone from the party to try my risotto and she said \"omg that is nothing compared how salty my jambalaya is\". 
The service was also just okay. I will be going to downtown Madison next time. This place has taken a big dive!"}
{"text":"The waitress greeted us promptly. The food was very delicious! Corn bread was awesome! The best jambalaya I have ever had! I also had endive salad, which came in huge portion."}
{"text":"April 2014 - The concept is great, the food was adequate, the service was flat.   I called for dress code advice and reservations and informed the employee that it would be our first visit to Liliana's and our party of four were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.  When I arrived at the restaurant I handed the hostess my credit card so that I could pay for the meal and again advised of the birthday celebration.   She seated us near the table bussing station in an nearly empty dining room.  The waiter was not engaged, the restaurant was out of Albita Lite beer,  one of us ordered the catfish po-boy and she received the catfish dinner, another ordered the steak medium and it arrived red in the middle.  My dish (Diablo Chicken) was not spicy at all and when I asked for more Sirachi sauce, he brought the sauce that was already on the chicken.  We had research the menu online and when we asked about hush puppies the waiter informed us the menu changes all the time and hush puppies were not available.  The cornbread was delicious, the pear salad was very good and the beignets were wonderful.  The hostess either did not convey to the waiter my payment request nor the birthday celebration or the waiter did not bother to comply with either.  

All in all it was a disappointment, the birthday boy did enjoy his jambalaya.

Not sure if were will be back."}
{"text":"First off I love Cajun food and the Louisiana culture! We had high hopes for this place however we left before we could taste their food. There was no hostess available to seat us. The owner eventually came out after people started lining up by the door...20 minutes later!  Right away there was a long black hair on the napkin which I pointed out. Owners sarcastic joke was that the hair was free of charge. Haha I wasn't amused after the long wait. Half and hour later waitress came to take our drink orders. We asked for water and their wine list. We left several minutes later because she never returned. It was a waste of an hour."}
{"text":"Snagged 2 seats at bar for Fat Tuesday. Bartenders were super helpful and friendly. Had a drink and somehow allowed myself to be talked into the pound cake over the beignets. Kind of disappointing--dry and bland with 4 sad blueberries. Music was just not very festive--rather off for far Tuesday."}
{"text":"I came here one Sunday morning for the brunch. First of all, the atmosphere and the interior of the restaurant is very good. 

Cornbread was served while waiting. It's very tasty and sweet.
I tried the jambalaya scramble. The sauce was well-flavored. And the potatoes were crispy on the outside and delicious.

My favorite part was probably a man playing lovely songs with the guitar, which made us an even better and relaxing dining experience."}
{"text":"A cute and fancy piece of Nawlins nestled in the outskirts of Madison, WI. Inside is decked out with Mardi Gras masks and lots of Fleur de Lis. The dining room was reminiscent of the Quarter with a working fountain and a Bourbon St style balcony. Service and the food were just ok. I understand that this is Wisconsin, not New Orleans, LA, but if you're serving food and calling it cajun, you need to come correct. (They came a lil sideways...maybe zigzag.)

KOREAN BBQ SEITAN:
$16 - Came with 2 round patties (think Salisbury steak), complete with grill marks. I tasted zero remnants of BBQ, so I'm unsure why that was part of the name. I wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessarily good either; I couldn't quite figure it out. It was interesting. However, the sweet potato puree and charred asparagus, which was hiding underneath the seitan patties, were both delicious! I could've used more of both and would've been satisfied with this dish. Vegan

RED BEANS & RICE (vegan version):
$15 - It looked great. It smelled great, yet the delivery fell short. It had a distinct sweetness to it, but no spice, little flavor, and no cajun soul. I doused it in some of their homemade hot sauces, but I couldn't save this dish. Oh, the possibilities. *insert sad face* And I have to admit, I was a little jealous of my friend's cornbread with jalapeño butter. Neither was vegan, so I couldn't eat it, but it made me really want a vegan version, which would go perfectly with some good, vegan red beans & rice.

CHOCOLATE CAKE:
$6 - A vegan and gluten free piece of chocolate cake with chlocolate and raspberry drizzle. I appreciate that they even offer a vegan dessert at a non-veg restaurant, but it wasn't anything to write home about. It was ok though. 

Like with the dessert, I love that they are so vegan friendly, but everything I ordered just didn't live up to its potential or expectation.  Even the hot tea was generic; I'd have been better off at Starbucks. Based on my experience, I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but I recommend that you at least try it for yourself."}
{"text":"This is a dynamite spot for Brunch. Bottomless mimosas are tasty and the refills come quick. I ordered the crab cake Benedict and my date ordered the breakfast sandwich. Both were absolutely delicious. Sometimes in the Midwest crab cakes can be suspect but have no fear they do it right! A generous helping of crab is in each cake. 

A very nice touch was the pastry included before the meal came out to eat with coffee. A must try for Creole or Cajun fans."}
{"text":"Great vegan options, though a little pricey.  Worth the trip.  Fancy interior with live music, and the outside is nice too though one side is definitely nicer."}
{"text":"Went during restaurant week - we are moving to Fitchburg and hoped to find a good neighborhood restaurant. Firstly all the staff seemed harassed - we had made reservations and  the hostess asked us did we understand it was restaurant week. we replied yes and she seemed relieved. The place looked fairly nice. It took us 20 mins to get drinks - 2 1/2 hours later to get an entire 3 course set menu, with 3 or 4 set 3 course meals varying by around $5 a time, no regular menu in service.

We asked could we swap anything - the server said no. She didn't' ask what we wanted, all we wanted was to each have a cup of vegetarian gumbo as a starter, which would have been easier for them and certainly cost less to them. failed restaurant test one, and while we expect reasonable accommodation of reasonable requests we do understand things in restaurant week, but since she never asked want we wanted, she just said no - fail.

The bus boy while filling the glasses said they'd been rushed, the place was half empty. We heard several other nearby tables complain about service. 

Food was meh - my entree was cold - steak and cheese grits and or polenta - or cheese polenta, yes it was that memorable, not. Rice in the gumbo was hard. 

Wine at $13 a glass - tiny pours - server was \"snooty\" re wine - i asked a question, my wife asked for a glass of Malbec, for some reason the wine list seemed hard for them to find - I asked was it an Argentinian Malbec or French (thinking perhaps French because it's a Cajun Restaurant, my wife has a I dunno she doesn't like French wine), server had no idea and looked at me as if i was speaking Klingon, yet had been ready to lecture us on wine. 

We moved to Madison 2 years ago after 15 years in Atlanta and Chicago - this is was the worst overall restaurant experience we've had in the Madison area in those 2 years and while the bill for 2 people and a couple of drinks wasn't abnormal for a major city - $150 for amateur hour doesn't cut it - 

We had two other meals at our regular spots in Madison proper during restaurant week, and both establishments while much busier than Liliana's were heads and shoulder's better experiences - in fact I'd wanted to leave as it didn't look like it would end well from the start but my wife had a 6am flight the next day and wanted to eat and not go off looking for somewhere else. We'll not be back and when we move just drive another 5 mins for Madison dining - if your restaurant can't handle restaurant week probably best to just close it that week. Just to add I own a restaurant - in a major city - and many of my friends own or manage restaurants, Chicago or Atlanta -   Sad!."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted. I enjoyed my meal at Liliana's. The rest of my party was a tad less enthusiastic. But this is my review, right? Right. So it gets a three.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is fun! It's classy, yet playfully New Orleans-like. There were cool lights representing street lamps of sorts, which lined the walkway/hallway to more seating that I found cool, plus a fountatin that was adjacent to the table we were at. First impressions: great. 

As far as food goes....three cheers for the complimentary cornbread! I LOVE cornbread and theirs was served nice and toasty warm with a jalapeno butter and it was all glorious. 

As I hysterically raved about the cornbread, we ordered calamari (of course) as an appetizer and while fried calamari is not my personal favorite, this dish was polished off by everyone else.


For entrees, we ordered:

*jambalya of blackened shrimp, andouille sausage, taso ham, nueske's bacon, peppers, tomatoes, onions, rice

*pasta liliana - shrimp, andouille, chicken, parpadelle pasta, spicy red pepper cream sauce

*pork tenderloin special

*scottish salmon, red pepper risotto, julienned squash, balsamic reduction, chive oil

*caesar salad


The jambalya was tasty though I feel unworthy of bashing/bolstering this dish as jambalya is uncharted territory for me. Truthfully, I'd say this was only my second experience with jambalya. Soooo I'm far from an expert on the dish. But I did enjoy it. I appreciated how the various ingredients/components worked together and complimented one another.

The pasta dish got the thumbs up. 

The pork tenderloin special, on the other hand, was mediocre. The pork was rather tough and overcooked. And the dish as a whole just had too much going on that it wasn't a cohesive entrée. The flavors were all over the place, not in a good way.

The salmon that I ordered as my meal was very tasty. The fish and risotto were both cooked just right and seasoned perfectly. 

Overall, I'm glad I tried Liliana's....and man am I craving that cornbread right about now."}
{"text":"2 Stars is for this particular night's server, not the food- which is always excellent.

We live near Liliana's and have been here multiple times.  The food is ALWAYS excellent.  Last night we were there with a group of 6.  We ordered 3 appetizers.  3 of us ordered salads.  All of us ordered entrees. When the salads came, one was a half and two were whole.  The half was huge and the whole could feed an army. A large army. When two if us said that we hadn't wanted that large a salad, the server said, \"the menu says half and whole.\" I said, \"Then you should ask us whether we want half or whole\".  She said, \"If you don't say, we give you a whole.\"  I said, \"Then you should change that and ask.\" And they should.  When a server is snotty with you, it colors the experience. (BTW, we heard a different server explain the salad size difference to a neighboring table, so we know it is not Liliana's policy.)

Several of us had the short ribs- and as usual- EXCELLENT!

We will be back, but really Liliana's, train your servers in this area. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday.  I had the fried shrimp po boy, which was awesome.  My wife had the mac and cheese which was also really good.  The only issue is the food takes a long time to get to your table and it wasn't very busy when we got there as we went at 5:30pm.  Kitchen is slow, but the food is great."}
{"text":"Love that they have excellent vegan options. I really like the vegan red beans and also the Seitan. Nice drink menu and friendly bartenders and servers."}
{"text":"I had the jambalaya and it was very good. GF had the fish and pasta, she loved it. Only problem was that we sat outside and a bee was bothering us.

otherwise the drinks are great, the food was plentiful, and the atmosphere was very calm!"}
{"text":"We didn't visit this restaurant in our own backyard for months because my partner \"doesn't like Cajun food\". He's a convert. Every dish we tried was delicious without tasting overly fatty: spicy without being unpleasantly hot. Dave is a food genius! Try the beignets with the chocolate mousse (cut them in half and stuff in the mousse!) and the tomato bisque. We did not try the jambalaya this time but the etouffee was excellent."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Liliana's much more than I was expecting. I came at 5:30 on a Saturday night, and, though I did have a reservation, there were still many open tables. I ordered the truffled endive salad and a bowl of the gumbo. Both were delicious. The salad was presented nicely and the portion was not too large or too small. The gumbo was very hearty and had an earthy, smokey touch- not to mention it was a tad spicy!

The decor was a perfect combination of classy and festive.  When the jazz pianist started playing later that night, I would have sworn I was actually in New Orleans. (A glace out the window to falling snow quickly diminished that notion...) Liliana's has a very comfortable atmosphere and it would be an easy place to sit for hours and talk your life away, or dream of the too-far-away Cajun country. This is perhaps the first restaurant that has won me over for its ambiance before its food.

All in all, a solid choice for a great night out!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give Liliana's a 5-star review because the food was very good. But we were overcharged at the restaurant (charged for two appetizers instead of one). When we called and spoke with the waitress, she assured us she would credit back our card. She never did that. Then I reached out to them on their website to let them know of the oversight. They never responded to me. Horrible customer service - good food."}
