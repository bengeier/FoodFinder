{"text":"If you're looking for some big portions of pretty yummy carne asada fries, come here. They're the closest things we've found in Vegas to the ones you can get in San Diego :) pretty good customer service and fairly reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and wanted to grab a quick dinner before heading back to Cali. We found this on yelp and decided to try it out, and we were NOT DISAPPOINTED! I ordered and Cali Burrito, and it was made to perfection. The carne asada was cooked just right, the tortilla tasted homemade, and there was also fries in it which was the cherry on top. My lovely wife and I are definitely planning on coming back next time we're in town. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went to a restaurant next door only to notice that the employees were having trouble keeping up with a line of a few people. I meant to come here at some point but glad I came sooner! Now, I eat a lot. And when I ordered the burrito meal, I was expecting two. But I got the carne asada burrito and it really was nothing like I've ever tasted before. The flavor here is just off the charts. There are so many things to choose from and will be back for Taco night."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this one night and I'm hooked.  I live around 12 minutes away but I crave this place.  I've gotten the rolled chicken tacos, Carne Asada plate and quesadilla. Nothing has disappointed me so far."}
{"text":"Very very tasty. I got a #17 which is a burrito your choice of meat, i got ground beef, lame choice i know but i like to start off with that, and a cheese enchilada, both were delicious. I also got a side chile relleno also very good....the beans were some of the best i've had, very good. Great value as well."}
{"text":"My gf and I went here because of the 15%off. We ordered some food (way to much) the food is excellent!!! One of the best Mexican places we have been. The serving sizes are crazy big.....we have enough food for 2 days and under $25. Will be back on our next cheat day!!"}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best mexican food in town at a very cheap price service was great     This place beats anywhere in town.  Go to it right now it shits on robertos and don tortaco and any place  I will be coming back all the time"}
{"text":"First time i got to try this place and it is absolutely delicious! My entire order was perfect i will be back very soon"}
{"text":"My local burrito joint. We go quite often with the kids. Highlight is the salsas. Rojo and habanero are the best two. In my mind a good burrito needs good sauce and this sauce is damn good. I usually get the nevada burrito and the kids always get bean and cheese burritos. Tortillas seem home made but probably ordered from a local maker. Either way they are done right. Staff is friendly and the food is consistent and fast. As far as taco shops go this one is a winner. 4 stars when compared to others of its kind"}
{"text":"This place is really good! My dad and I eat out alot because we work late. We were on our way to fat burger but we saw habeneros right behind it so we decided to give it a shot. The customer service was great and the food was great and not that pricey. Now we have a new place to go to eat Mexican food. Definitely happy and going back! No more pepes tacos or Chipotle for us"}
{"text":"I use to love this place! It was good Mexican food if you didn't want Robertos. But then after a few visits they seem to not care. They forget to give you a straw with your drink. I order a steak and egg burrito and instead they give me bacon burrito. This has happened several times. They will no longer have our business."}
{"text":"I work very close to this location and have been here many times and have tried almost everything they have on menu. For the price you pay you get really good quality food. I usually get the chimichanga, the fried tortilla is always fresh and the meat is zesty and delicious. The portions are really good and the ingredients are fresh. The food also comes out really quick so much better then like a Taco Bell or dell taco."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed. After reading a handful of reviews, I had high hopes.  Placed an order and told that it'd be ready in 8 minutes.  This is unheard of, and I quickly drove to pick up my order... it took me 15 minutes to get to the place, only to discover that it's a drive thru/fast food joint.  I walked in, service was quick.  My food had obviously been sitting for a while.  I signed the check, tipped and walked out.  Laughing to myself that I had just placed a pickup order at a fast food restaurant.  I get home, open the items, which looked ok.  I liken it to Chinese take out.  However, once I began eating, it was quite obvious that I needed some sort of salsa, as the food was extremely bland.  For a place called habaneros grill, I would anticipate there to be some level of spice.  Or at the very least a salsa that I can place on the food.   I had high hopes and unfortunately will not be returning."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food! Is the best! You guys so go and try it out they give you the food quick. Is the best Mexican place"}
{"text":"Picked up two breakfast breakfast burritos Sunday morning and gave a little of it to my 17 month old son. By 2:30 pm that afternoon my son was vomiting horrifically over 7 times over a period of 4 hours. By 7:00 pm I began to feel stomach cramps and vomited myself just shortly after. Throughout that night I had severe diarrhea and stomach cramps. Could not sleep at all that night . The next day was miserable . My poor son would not stop crying that whole day , broke my heart.  I contacted my friend whom ate the second burrito I purchased and he had the exact same experience I personally had . DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE !!"}
{"text":"The adobada fries were amazing! The carne asada tacos were good too, however next time I would add guac to those!"}
{"text":"Exellent food, Excellent prices, the food is amazing  I really recoment this place really good food  and tasty"}
{"text":"The best mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, I recommend this place, very nice, clean and the food is really good!"}
{"text":"This place didn't rate one star for me because of the food. It was the service! I placed my order ahead of 10 Hispanic men. They were all served their food before mine.  I'd say go ahead and eat here if you have plenty of time to wait or try and hit it when there's no other customers."}
{"text":"Huge street tacos, 3-$5, can't beat that with any choice of meats. Salsa bar way better than Roberto's. Always have a special each day of week."}
{"text":"This place is a main staple in my house a few times a week. Menu and food is similar to Roberto's. Great food and service, staff is always really nice."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Came on a whim because I was craving nachos and will be back soon for more!"}
{"text":"Average taco joint, similar to Roberto's.  If you want cheap eats this is a good place to go.  I won't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Food and service is great. Similar to Don Tortaco Mexican Grill and much better than Roberto's."}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos (carnitas) great deals price wise and nice people.  Love that it has a drive through!"}
{"text":"Placed a order for our office they forgot our drink called and they had the nerve to tell us nothing they could do. WTH!? Just plain rude customer service! Food is good, horrible employees!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great hours and amazing carne Asada fries. Do yourself a favor and get those. The portions are enormous.  Super cheap as well! I come here on my way home late at night from the strip. Never lets me down."}
{"text":"excellent food and reasonably priced.  Go to place for burritos and tacos.  Great breakfast burritos"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, and CLEAN atmosphere. Beats any other Mexican fast food restaurant by far! If you're looking for quality Mexican fast food at a good price, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Excellent Carne Asada Burrito, I would go back again. Roberto's is okay the only issue I have is that the Carne Asada Burrito taste at different Roberto's either spicy or just bland."}
{"text":"I finally found a place that had chile verde burritos. The burrito was huge. Unfortunately, it was filled with rice and beans and a little meat. It was still good but could be better with more meat. I also tried their carnitas torta. It wasn't bad but different with diced meat and shredded lettuce. I like the type that has slices of meat. The service was good and reminded me of Roberto's with the drive-up and the look of the menu outside."}
{"text":"This place is sooo amazing! Blows Roberto's out the water. Robertos is like taco bell compared to this place! The staff is really friendly! I didn't know what to get I wanted a torta and the guy told me the all pastor torta was the best. So I tried it and I loved it!!! Also my fiance was going to get the carne asada nacho, but you can choose your meat!! How awesome is that!! I am mexican and I approve this place!! Also people that don't give it a five star, maybe you should leave  them a tip that is not change."}
{"text":"I called and ordered 2 orders of carne asada fries which on your online menu shows as $6.25/per order. When I arrived to pick it up the total was $17.38, when I questioned the price her told me that the fries are $7.99/each and advised that website shows $6.25 and asked him to honor her refused and stated  \"the owner doesn't car about updating the price and won't let us price adjust it\""}
{"text":"Awesome American-Mexican food from a drive through, attentive service, and the speak English.  I got the bends coming from LA."}
{"text":"It's good for the price. I had the Carne asafa burrito and my son got rhe rolled tacos. We enjoyed both our dishes."}
{"text":"Very tasty Caldo de Camarones, friendly staff and a very clean dining area. Will come back for sure  The prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"Friendly service and food was ok and good prices. There are so many taco joints in town, you really have to be exceptional to catch a diner's attention.  This place was decent but nothing note worthy."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of my go tos for lunch. Love the 3 for $5 carne asada street tacos"}
{"text":"This place is just okay. Not sure why it has so many five stars. We had the Carne Asada burrito way to much gristle in the meat and dry also had the Taquitos with guacamole they tasted pretty good. Side order of fries came out super greasy. No return visit for us. I approve this message J K KUHL..."}
{"text":"Chili rellenos on point. So yummy!! I like that they are not deep fried and covered in batter. I like those ones too but I feel a little healthier eating these ones."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I come here for lunch atleast once a week. My favorite is their green chile chicken enchiladas! I have also had their carne asada burrito, there $1 chicken, ground beef tacos, chicken tortas, tamales, churros etc. and everything is so delicious! I have 0 complaints for this place! They also opened their 2nd location but this location is still my favorite. The staff is always friendly and drive thru is fast!"}
{"text":"I've ate here a few times and haven't got disappointed yet, so if you want some real fast Mexican food this is the place to go around this area"}
{"text":"Super good! Was here yesterday and got 2 al pastor tacos, they're huge! Came back today ordered the #6 chile rellano and cheese enchilada. Babe ordered the carne asada fries. Horchata es Bueno tambien!"}
{"text":"Perfect for my lengua taste!!!! Good customer service and place is clean. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Good taco shops similar to Roberto's. Street tacos definitely worth the money. 24-hour is a bonus especially late night and if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Will have to agree on most of the reviews being similar to Robertos, but good is good.  I had the Al Pastor burrito which was awesome and my friend had the carne asada fajitas.  Everything was great but service was kinda lost, didnt like to have to pay for chips and couldent get the chips before our order was ready, so 4 stars.  give me my chips and salsa while I wait for my food and smile and get 5 stars."}
{"text":"After seeing all the positive reviews, I was thoroughly disappointed with my experience.   Ok, it's a fast food Mexican joint, so there is plenty of slack to be given on décor, service etc... but the cashiers and servers literally acted as if they didn't want to help anyone.   All the food tasted like it was microwaved or at least very old and reheated. Carne Asada was rubbery and the shrimp taco tasted like it was microwaved.  2 stars because the chorizo burrito wasn't the worst."}
{"text":"My new favorite taco shop! Super tasty!! If you have an eaten here yet you must try it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, i like it better than Robertos! Everyone is real nice and the food is Bomb! The fish tacos are delicious even the basic bean and cheese burritos are delicious.. Thank you Habaneros we'll see you again soon!"}
{"text":"To the owner of this store, your cashier who alleges her name as Maria was one of the rudest people I have dealt with. We placed a $40 order with Uber eats and they missed one of the items we ordered , a shrimp burrito. I understand mistakes happen that is not my issue. The issue comes from the worst customer service I have ever experienced from someone when they admired to their error. We called asking for a solution and she snapped at me telling me what do you want me to do about it we were busy, deal with it. She did not offer any solution but telling us we can drive our lazy asses to the store to pick it up or suck it up. I asked for a manager she told me no! I asked her is this how she treats customers, we ordered Uber eats for convenience now our entire meal is messed up and one member of my family is missing out. Her response was \"not my problem\" is this how you treat customers?!!!!! Another issue we asked for no beans on several of our orders , they all came with beans!"}
{"text":"IT'S GOOD if you're looking for a slight upgrade from Roberto's, but, it's not anything amazing. Coming from LA where the Mexican food is plenty, delicious, and cheap, it's always so hard to be impartial (I KNOW, I KNOW ONE OF THOSE LA SNOBS AGAIN - sorry not sorry). I wanted to sample a little bit of their menu so I ordered: carne asada tacos, rolled tacos, and carne asada fries. The tacos were good (but it's hard to mess up street tacos - it's like 3 ingredients), rolled tacos are equal to Roberto's, and fries were just blah (the toppings were good but the fries themselves tasted old).   Would I come back? If I was in the neighborhood and wanted something quick. Would I go out of my way? Probably not. If I was going to go out of my way for Mexican I would go Tacos el Gordo or Frijoles and Frescas."}
{"text":"This is what Mexican fast food should be. Good food for a good price. This beats Roberto's tacos hands down.   The restaurant setup makes me think of Wendy's but the food makes me think actual Mexican restaurant. I'm very pleased with my visit here. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I won't be back until they stop frying all there food in Manteca Lard.... the tacos taste like pig. So unhealthy and gross."}
{"text":"Back to being delicious! 5 stars I'm literally addicted to this place. You've created a monster lol"}
{"text":"My lady and are taco fanatics, and we are always in search of a great taco. This place is literally walking distance from our home so we decided to give it a try after leaving Home Depot. Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to order anything due to the staff not even acknowledging us upon walking in. There were two workers there, one was cutting tomatoes and the other one was occupied as well. At one point they communicated with each other and awkwardly stared at us for a brief moment but did not serve us. We really felt unwanted and being that my lady and I are an interracial couple It was so awkward we just decided to leave. I see why this place is empty lol"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Maybe because it's right down the street from my house or because the guys that work here always super friendly and nice. But the food is always what you expect and reasonably priced. Plus the fact they have a drive-through is freaking awesome"}
{"text":"We seen this place on Yelp and stopped in for dinner! We ordered the street chicken tacos and beef tacos.  The food and service was awesome.  He explained everything and was very helpful since it was our first time there. The salsa bar was really good too. Try the churros, they are really fresh!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times now & it's my new overall favorite of all the fast/quick casual Mexican places and by far the best value, however, I suspect they will raise prices once business picks up. The $1 special tacos are an awesome deal! The chicken soft taco one is just like Del Taco's but with way more chicken & tastes fresher, however, I do prefer Del Taco's sauce over the plain sour cream used in this one. The chicken taco al carbon looked plain, as there were only onions & no cilantro but once I added some salsa from their salsa bar it was delicious! I will be going back for these 2 tacos often. The order taker thought I also ordered a ground beef soft taco. It's not something I would normally order but the meat was flavored well. There was only lettuce & cheese on it.  My favorite Mexican dish is a chile relleno, however, they can be hit & miss. This one is prepared very nicely! Normally I'm not a fan of red enchilada sauce on them but this one pairs well! The cheese enchilada the #6 meal is paired with is very good also. Rice & beans are standard.   And lastly, the 5 rolled tacos w/guacamole for $3.75 is a deal! They are very similar to Roberto's although Roberto's is more generous w/the toppings (not that Habaneros' is skimpy) & may be a little tastier but these are definitely worth ordering."}
{"text":"What are people talking about? Their adobada fries were subpar tasted like taco bell sauce. The nevada burrito with carne asada didnt taste all that good. Service was good and fast though. Robertos is better!"}
{"text":"Congratulations to Habaneros. You decided to take a political stance against this wash rag... Unfortunately others like Robertos, and Tacos Las Mexicana were open.  I've had issues a few times with my orders which were never corrected. Your solution was for me to pay again because of a language barrier. Now you're mixing business with politics!  Bad business practices put companies out of business."}
{"text":"A great change of pace from the typical taco spots in town. The sauces are on point along with all of the go-to menu items. Fresh & authentic flavor win a great price!"}
{"text":"It's basically Roberto's, with a few different menu items. Quality is okay, portions are large, prices are pretty affordable. Unfortunately, the food was somewhat lacking- chile relleno lacked heat in both the pepper itself as well as the sauce but I liked that it wasn't overbattered, and the ceviche tostada was a shrimp mixture that seemed as if it hadn't marinated long enough but it was really fresh.   One \"different\" menu item to try is the #26 special. It's a 5-piece order of rolled tacos topped with lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream, guac, and your choice of meat. It's like asada fries, but with taquitos instead of fries. Definitely enough for 2-3 people to share.  Drive thru service was quick and polite, I preferred their green salsa to the red. They have menudo on weekends."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, first time ordered 2 breakfast burritos and they were good. For lunch today we ordered a Carnitas chimichanga plate and a carne asada wet burrito. Very flavorful, nice large portions, and not too costly. Food tastes home made, beans are light and fluffy, rice was cooked perfectly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Totally worth the drive from the other side of town to come here when I want good Mexican food. I have been here twice and I am more than satisfied."}
{"text":"I was in the area and needed to grab a quick lunch. I ordered the carne asada burrito plate and horchata. The carne asada was good but not cravable and the size was on the smaller side for the price. The rice was bland and the beans were mushy and runny. I wouldn't order the rice and beans again."}
{"text":"Love their food and prices! Staff is so friendly as well! My favorite part is their salsa bar!! If you like spicy they have Habanero salsa YUM! =)"}
{"text":"This is perhaps the best taco shop in Vegas. Definitely come here as opposed to the other location on Rainbow. The portions are huge and the staff is extremely friendly. Get the super burrito or my personal favorite, the adobada plate."}
{"text":"After a few long hours of shopping, we were famished.  Along the way home my husband pointed out Habanero's. He said he wanted to try it so off we went.   The establishment was very clean when we stepped foot inside, the cashier was very helpful and answered any questions we had. Prices are very reasonable and portions are big, our total for our meals with three drinks only came out to $30. It's definitely a step up from Roberto's.   Item's ordered:  - Fish burrito - Carne asada burrito - 2 carne asada tacos - Chicken taquitos meal  The taquitos meal came with a side of rice and beans, there were 5 taquitos, which was surprising because most establishments only include 3. They were topped off with lettuce, cheese, and guacamole. The carne asada tacos were served on an average sized tortilla instead of the typical small ones and came topped with tomatoes, lettuce, cilantro, and guacamole, surprising as well since most places charge extra for guacamole. Carne asada burrito was huge, so was the fish burrito. Downside, they use frozen fish sticks for the fish burrito. You could taste them, that's the only complaint. Overall, everything was good and had good flavor. They have a good variety of self serve salsa's as well.   Employees were very nice, we came in with our two small boys and the cashier put on a movie for them to watch meanwhile we dined, so thank you Habanero's!"}
{"text":"So I'm not a fan of hole in the wall Mexican places but a friend referred me and it was awful. They made my order wrong and i didn't like it. Then another friend took me and I'm hooked on those shredded chicken tacos. I am super picky and will only eat the tacos if they're made a certain way. Bryan is the nicest worker there and makes sure my tacos are always cooked right and have the toppings that I like! I probably won't be able to come here anymore without Bryan. Thank you for making such great tacos and an awesome experience"}
{"text":"I've driven past Habaneros hundreds of times and never given it a first, second, or third thought, but on a whim, a friend took me here for lunch and I finally got to see what it was all about. Habaneros is a pretty authentic Mexican fast food joint (think more Roberto's than Taco Bell).   Nothing fancy, the crowded menu is listed behind the counter. They sell all versions of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and everything in between. Prices are perhaps slightly higher than Roberto's, but a meal of 4 chicken tacos and a chicken quesadilla (which comes with guacamole and sour cream) was around $15.   I didn't sample the tacos, but my quesadilla was tasty, didn't taste processed, was full of meat, and I had enough left to take home for a small snack later. The guacamole wasn't that good, though- runny and tasteless. Eh, can't win em all, I guess.  I'd stop through if you are craving a quick authentic Mexican meal that doesn't break the bank- don't keep passing Habaneros by!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing prices, beats any other taco shop in town...highly recommend Adobada fries!"}
{"text":"I ordered their 'Green Chile Pork' plate (chili verde in the picture). That was not chili verde. It was pork carnitas with green sauce and there's a big difference. Fans of the slow cooked dish will be sorely disappointed.   Oh, and let's talk about the green beans in my rice, and the peas and carrots in my brother in law's burrito, which was actually advertised as a chili verde burrito. I'm sorry....since when is it cool to just sneak in some mushy, frozen dinner quality veg into chili verde?   The refried beans had zero taste. Disappointing. Like paste.  I had a few shrimp tacos on the side and they didn't suck, but I had to go buy a few more just to make it seem like my dinner wasn't a complete waste of time.   Now I'm heading to Del Taco for a churro shake because I don't have any interest in seeing how Habaneros Taco Grill ruins churros.   I'm going to stick to going to Roberto's. Should have just went there tonight. Sad that I didn't."}
{"text":"I tried their adobada fries, carne asada taco, and al pastor taco. Comparing to authentic taco stands and even Tacos El Gordo. Their food was poor. The adobada/al pastor wasn't good. The tacos was not tasty. Maybe it's because I have high standards for a good taco."}
{"text":"Big fan, and have been here 4 times in just over a month. A superb value, and the masterful in-house habanero salsa on their fresh salsa bar truly makes their food! It packs heat, but not an extreme amount. Easily one of the best-balanced habanero salsas I've tasted.  Their proteins are average (but lean) and their building appears to be an ex-TacoBell, and they usually have the radio on, Telemundo on, and the Minions movie on all at the same time, but if you can handle all of that, their habanero salsa should win you over. And the restaurant is clean and well-kept. Service is always friendly.  Their everyday 3 for $5 al carbon tacos deal is reliable, as well as their $1 chicken tacos special. As long as you're down with liberal dousings of habanero salsa, you should enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Actually for fast food very good and authentic...I've ate here a few times already and enjoy it much more than Robertos."}
{"text":"I opted for the adobada fries (everyday special) and for under $7 I had some deliciously crisped fries topped with guacamole, cheese, and tender carne adobada. Went with the habanero salsa and it gave this Mexican a run for her money. It was pretty legit. Will definitely try again but for now it scored a home run!"}
{"text":"The best tacos I've had in a long time. Makes robertos and Faustos taste like taco bell"}
{"text":"I do love this place. Food reminds me like being back in San Diego.   But five or of seven trips I've said no guac and every time it's been there.   Aside from that I've enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I didn't like the food very much. The guacamole was very runny and the burritos were nothing special  -- I thought it would be so good based on the reviews here. Roberto's is waaaaay better. No contest."}
{"text":"If Taco Bell did everything better, this is what you'd get. They have more authentic Mexican soft drinks, and the food comes in larger portions and is of noticeably better quality. No good Mexican restaurant is complete with a solid condiment bar and here you will find pico, spicy carrot and radishes, as well as a few sauces ranging from mild to hot. What to get? Can't go wrong with a fish or beef burrito and I'd advise getting the horchatta."}
{"text":"This is a nice clean Mexican grill. One of the best in the city. I'm a sucker for these places, and in this area, this is the best spot I've found.  Excellent food and service, and good prices."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and found this place on Yelp. Gave them a call and came right over. Very polite on the phone and even more so in person. The first place I've had taco Tuesday in town where they really made us feel welcome and informed us about other specials throughout the week. Awesome guys working here and the food rocks..... And the salsa has a Kick! Come get some!"}
{"text":"Poor service, didn't stick around to order anything. You ever feel like you're invisible?"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Highly recommend that you try this place out. Good tamales for the price. Great customer service. Go here about 1-2 times a month to eat some delicious food."}
{"text":"The spot came recommended as being close by with good food.  Truth be told, the Nevada burrito I ordered was DELISH, but it totally upset my stomach for the entire weekend & currently as I write this.  Unfortunately 'after' I ordered & ate my meal that same day, I then overheard (from the same staff that referred me) that other folks had gotten sick from prior visits.    I wish I hadn't experienced this trauma, because I would totally go back.  Great service as well."}
{"text":"Meh, not very good, food was average, knowledge of food was not there. I'm a vegetarian so I like people to know if their beans or rice have lard or stock in them and they didn't"}
{"text":"Whenever I need some good fast Mexican food I go here. Apart from it being close to my house, they have some pretty good food. I've never really been inside the place. I usually go through the drive through and there's usually never a line. I think I've only waited the most 2-3 mins to get my food.  Service is usually friendly and speedy. Staff could probably smile a little more but it's not a big deal. I usually order their street tacos, tostadas, taqueria, tamales or their veggies burritos. The fact that they even have a vegetarian option on their menu is awesome!   Another thing I'm quite happy about is that they open pretty late. Maybe not 24 hrs, but late enough. If you haven't already give this place a try. They have a long menu with lots of options to choose from."}
{"text":"Very clean place, friendly service. The food is excellent,  homemade flavors. Loved it."}
{"text":"Not to mimic a lot of previous reviews, but..yes it is similar in menu and presentation to Roberto's. And yes cleaner than most of the Roberto's locations I've visited.   Nevada burrito was very good.  I've give it a thumbs up over the CA burrito.   Chicken tacos for a buck each and not skimping on the chicken. A great deal for a dollar.   Fish tacos for $2.85 were a meal in themselves.     Not sure if this is better than Roberto's but admittedly this was our first time visiting Habanero's whereas we've been going to Roberto's for years.    We'll be back for a second visit."}
{"text":"Great California Carne Asada burrito. Went through drive through. Very convenient. Salsas (red and green) were much better than Roberto's and Fausto's. Actually had some flavor and kick to them. Only place like this that I know has a drive-thru. Would come again."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the quality of the food the chips were hot but tasted old like they refried them few times and after I ate like 4 chips my throat started getting scratchy very weird feeling I ordered one steak taco one pastor wich is pork I also ordered rice and beans the tacos were ok. But nothing extraordinary not authentic Mexican food the rice and beans tasted like the ones from taco bell or del taco.  I do not recommend this place. I will defently NOt been going back."}
{"text":"Great little taco shop and/or Mexican food. Good prices for taco Tuesday a dollar each. Light crispy shell are great, not greasy. Wonderful place for prices."}
{"text":"I was very impressed. I had super burrito and made it enchilada style. Husband had carne asada rolled tacos. Kids split carne asada fry. I loved it. Will order again"}
{"text":"I went here craving real Mexican tacos. Then I saw the 15% off for a check in and I thought \"why not try it out\" I got the #5 2 any meat soft tacos with rice and beans. I was gonna take a picture but I was so Hungry I forgot. These tacos were soo good. They definitely satisfied my craving! This place in my opinion is better then Robertos. I highly recommend it. And I'm definitely going to be going back often."}
{"text":"This place has been in this location for a while now. We've always passed it because it didn't look like it would be too good. We decided to try it for dinner one night and it was amazing! I had the ground beef chimichanga and it is my favorite! Great for a nice quick dinner!"}
{"text":"This place took over what used to be Baja Taco. The food is very similar to Roberto's and the price is practically the same. The food and service is always top notch, so if you're ever in the area, stopping by wouldn't hurt. This place is basically a Roberto's with a drive-thru and their delicious signature habanero sauce."}
{"text":"This place is not just disgusting; it feels dangerous. Tonight we ordered a chicken burrito, chorizo con huevos, and some chips with cheese, delivered by Uber. The food came right away but was God-awful. The chicken burrito was not just not-warm, it was COLD, as though it had just been taken out of the refrigerator.  We tossed it for fear the chicken wasn't cooked properly. The chorizo plate had a syrupy greenish substance that may have once been guacamole but looked toxic and made the dish inedible. The chips were dried out with a glue-like hard cheese. This disaster is run-for-your-life bad. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Pulling out of Home Depot, Habaneros caught my eye. Pulling up I commented to my wife how clean the place looked. Reading the menu I liked all the choices and the prices. However, the best part of the whole experience was the food. Not overly sodium laden like the other taco chain that you see everywhere. Definitely going to make this a permanent spot on my list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Friday the 13th of April, I started work a little later and thought to pick up lunch for my clients mom and I since she tends to feed me authentic at home cooking Mexican food.  Headed towards their drive thru and ordered 2 #5 combos: came with 2 tacos with your choice of meat (I got carne asada)beans, and rice. I also ordered their strawberry churros and 2 horchata drinks. Spent a total of $21 which I thought was reasonable. I waited a few minutes till i got my food. The man working there was very nice and polite.  It's not an \"omg\" it's so delish kinda thing but it filled me up and my clients mom was very appreciative. Horchata was refreshing btw.   I'll be back if i want a quickie taco to go. I gave 4 stars cause it was quick, my order was right, the man was nice, and my food wasn't all messed up...hehe.. Happy Eats!!!"}
{"text":"I've always had a fantastic experience at Habaneros. Friendly staff, great authentic Mexican fast food, speedy service, and clean friendly environment."}
{"text":"Great tacos!  Not the same place that used to be here. Breakfast tacos all day. Great stuff"}
{"text":"Love that there's a dine in AND drive thru option! Prices are cheap, tastes pretty good, clean, and kind workers. There's an abundance of parking for this area and when I went, it wasn't that busy. I would recommend the #5, which come with two tacos, rice, and beans. the shredded beef was my favorite but the chicken was also good. Not much for me to complain about!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing!!!! Cheaper than Roberto's and sooooo good. Definitely a fan and plan on introducing others to the deliciousness that is Habaneros."}
{"text":"Three rolled tacos with guac under $4.00 Hit the drive thru-fast service. If it's a greasy sodium fest you won't find it here like Robertos. How refreshing is that."}
{"text":"Awesome!. My husband brought some dinner from this place and he's been telling everyone about how good everything was. So I finally had a chance to go and take some food for lunch. I asked the guy if he had rolled tacos filled with potatoes, He said we can do anything you like. I loved that answer.  I got 5 potato rolled tacos with rice and beans. Everything was delicious, this is the best Mexican fast food I've eaten in the U.S. The beans and rice  tasted homemade, the taquitos were crunchy and with enough filling. Next time I will ask with no guacamole or cheese, because I got so full. I was able to eat only 3.My only complaint or comment is that I got the habanero salsa and a regular salsa, and the regular salsa was spicier than the habanero one. Maybe they got mixed. Even the salsas are really good and you can actually taste different flavors on each salsa. ( the others fast food places, all their salsas taste the same or don't have any flavor). I have to add, the cashier was so nice and friendly and my order was ready in less then 10 minutes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this shop since it is near our home and we have liked everything here. However, today we went through the drive through ordered a breakfast burrito and a few tacos. We got home, took our items from the bag and noticed the burrito was unusually small. We opened it up and unrolled the entire tortilla before finding any meat! I will post a picture above. This is not a burrito. This is a taquito in a soft tortilla. What a rip off. This is not worth $6. We are very unhappy with what we have spent our money on at your establishment."}
{"text":"Outstanding Mexican food and very inexpensive prices.  Second time eating there and it was as good as the first.  Mixed fajita platter and chile verde platter. Terrific flavors.  Great salas. Delicious beans and rice.  I'm guessing some lard went into making those beans taste so yummy. Really good food.  Really good."}
{"text":"Updated review. The food is still good but they are allowing too many homeless people & meth heads to hang out inside & outside which is a turn off to regular customers. A homeless guy was asking customers in the drive thru for money & the management did not tell him to leave! If this keeps up I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Got the Carne asada torta and the beef rolled tacos. Great pricing, the torta was delicious the rolled tacos I won't get again. They were okay but had hardly any meat. Green sauce is good but Lil to spicy for me."}
{"text":"First time here. We were looking for street tacos and seen this place on Yelp. We ordered the street tacos, enchiladas and torta. They were all delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've drove past this place a million times and I could kick myself for not trying it out a lot sooner than this! I was on a serious Mexican Food craving streak this past weekend and wanted something other than Roberto's. Something fast and not sit-down restaurant style. Ah-ha! Habaneros Taco Grill awaited for me! I previewed the menu slightly on YELP prior to pulling up in the drive thru because umm that's what us true YELPER's do.. Check that place out and it's reviews before stepping foot in to spend some money. Plenty people compared this place to Roberto's and rightfully so. The vibe they gave me had some very similar things in common. I have to give this place a one up on Roberto's because the variety that they have on the menu.. It can be a bit overwhelming in the drive thru because the options seem unlimited! If it's a Mexican dish you want I'm betting they have it and if it's not on the menu I'm sure they can make it! I love the \"California\" style burritos and really enjoyed the fact that they let the customer decide on the meat options. El Pastor happens to be one of my favorite meat type's and I decided on that as my meat choice on the burrito. No additional cost just the flat $5.75! Can't beat that! Most places charge you according to the type of meat you choose to have and I like that they don't. Carne Asada is what comes with this burrito selection at Roberto's so that's all I knew. I think I have found my new Roberto's replacement, who knows we have to see how they measure up on the Carne Asada fries! All in all It great!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in Vegas.  Best carne asada burrito in Vegas.  Order a side of tortilla chips. They are heaven - made fresh, hot and crunchy."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for Mex.food. Very bland , reminded me of nasty Robertos..male cashier has issues. Just a blank stare .maybe doesn't understand English. Nasty funky fish tacos. Luke-warm food. No service with a smile here....won't be back."}
{"text":"Located in the Home Depot complex, used to be the Popeyes.  The food is great, especially the Nevada Burrito (so much better than the Claifornia) which is any meat of your choice, French fries, cheese and guacamole for only around $5. They have all the hot sauces and pickled carrots like Robertos. They do have everyday specials including two types of $1 chicken tacos, one with cheese and and lettuce while the other has onions and cilantro.  The location is clean, which is different from most Robertos locations. This location does have drive thru and the wait is surprisingly not that long."}
{"text":"One of our favorite go to places. My husband and I always go through the drive thru. They are fairly quick and always so friendly! Prices are very reasonable for the food you get. They have daily specials so thats always a plus. We usually do not get those because we enjoy all the other yummie things.   We love their green chilaquiles, the red ones are far too spicy! Their red salsa in general is seriously just too much. The chile relleno burrito is pretty tasty and a great vegeterian choice! Any of their choices with carne asada are also great. Meat is juicy and tender.   We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I work close by this taco shop and I love it. Employees are always friendly and helpful. Self serve salsa bar is great!! Fresh chips yammiiii!!!  Love their street tacos, torta and burritos"}
{"text":"Still hooked on this place, my last review was in Sept of 2015, almost a year later and I'm still a fan. The service is always friendly and fast, the place is kept very clean and the food is outstanding. The have street tacos that will blow you away and the price is right. The Carne Asada Tacos are still my favorite, packed full of meat and guac. My wife recently got a carne asada burrito and it was gone before I knew it. They are opening a second location soon, I'm sure they will be very busy!"}
{"text":"I been on this hard shell taco phase and I was pleased with these tacos. They have ground beef, shredded beef and chicken.  Some places don't put enough meat and/or the shell is super hard and breaks off. Plus this place has a drive thru and a wide menu of different options. Keep up the good Tacos and great work!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this business a 5 star review. This is for the newly opened Habanero's Grill # 2 at 604 N. Rainbow Bl., just west of Washington. If you think this is \"just another\" mex fast food stand, think again. I have to say, I haven't had burritos this good, this tasty, since I left California almost 10 years ago. Habanero's may not be the best in Vegas --- but they're the best I'VE had in Vegas. I've had the simple bean & cheese burrito. It took the simple fare to another level. The beans were just Better. And it's Huge. I've had the 3 meat breakfast burrito, that sucker damn near made me cry it was so awesome. I've had the egg, bean & cheese burrito, fantastic! I've had the adobado fries, excellent!  The salsa bar is the best, too. The salsas range from mild - to pretty dang hot, and I like that. They have taco specials. Monday is hard shell seasoned ground beef tacos for $1. Tuesday is hard shell chicken tacos for $1.  Wednesday is 3 fish tacos for $5. I'm telling you - don't make the mistake of thinking Habanero's is the same old same old, don't lump them in with Roberto's, or Pepe's.  Habanero's Grill epitomizes all the great flavorful Mexican offerings to be had in Southern California, without having to go there."}
{"text":"My first  impression of this place was, wow, it's a lot cleaner than robertos. I ordered the California burrito and my bf ordered the carnita plate. The California burrito was really good compared to other places I have tried. It tasted fresher and the meat was better than other places. The condiment bar was a lot more cleaner and fresher too. The haberno sauce that they have is kind of weak. Lol. When I think of habenero, I think of burn your bunghole off, but it wasn't spicy at all for me (you got lucky my butthole.. Until next time!!) my bf's carnita plate was okay. The pork was a tad burnt so it was just average. The reason for the 4 stars is because of cleanliness, friendly staff, and fresher ingredients and my burrito was way delicious and better than other places. Minus 1 star for the burnt carnita."}
{"text":"The chicken soft tacos and the taco al carbon are a buck each. Those are the only thing I've tried so far. For a dollar each those are pretty good tacos. Del taco is usually our go to spot for a cheap chicken taco, but these are better. We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Clean set up and friendly staff. Easy menu with great pictures. The food is pretty fantastic too and the prices are great."}
{"text":"Oh my word! Now that was a good burrito! Nevada style with adobada meat. Loved every bite and ate the whole thing and it was gigantic."}
{"text":"Mediocre food in  quick serve environment. After I ordered they told me they were running low on carnitas so ended up giving me what was left and filled out the rest of the order with carne aside. The carnitas weren't bad -- subtle sweetness, tender and savory. The carne aside on the other hand, wasn't very good. The quality of meat looked poor and it wasn't seasoned enough making it really bland. Rice and beans were basic. Nothing that you couldn't get at a million other Mexican joints. They do have a drive thru for those on the run."}
{"text":"I was very hesitant to stop by this place because previously it was called \"Baja Taco\" and I wondered if it was the same people trying to pass off the same food with a new name. Baja Taco was nothing authentic, but the food was fresh and decent enough. While I have no idea if it's the same people, I did enjoy what I ordered here from Habanero Tacos and would stop by again.   Rolled Tacos with Sour Cream and Cheese ($3.50 for 3) - I didn't choose the rolled tacos with guacamole because from the pictures on yelp the guac looks like the runny frozen type, so I passed. There was a generous amount of shredded cheddar and sour cream on top of the rolled tacos and it all tasted good. I liked that they weren't very greasy either. Solid option and something I'd order again.   Carne Asada Burrito (5.75) - I asked for just meat, cheese and salsa. The salsa was fresh and the meat was tender with good flavor. My hubby even liked his.   I can't say the food was anything I'd drive across town for and it's not authentic Mexican food, but it did taste good and the drive-thru is convenient. The guy who took our order was very friendly and verified our order when it was ready ensuring we had everything. Currently you can get chicken tacos on Monday or ground beef tacos on Tuesday for $1 each. The yelp check in offer has expired and can't be used."}
{"text":"Ordered the 2 taco plate (carne asada) and a side of fries. Wasn't a fan of the tacos but the fries were ok."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were intrigued by the name of this place because we both love spicy food and I'm so glad that we decided to try it out! The grilled chicken soft tacos are the best!! I could probably eat it everyday lol"}
{"text":"Drive thru is really a huge help when you have a toddler with you. We ordered and got the food on a reasonable wait. I really liked my carne asada plate. Good size for the money. Only thing I dont like is when I asked for those picked carrots and jalapeno. Lady said sure but it wasnt in my bag when I got home."}
{"text":"Delish!! Must try the Nevada and the California burrito with carne asada. I'm not even a burrito person, and I can't stop eating these."}
{"text":"Super fast. Great food. People were super friendly. Almost makes me forget about Robertos."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great! The place is clean! The staff is friendly and professional! Roberto's and places like this are in the same category but I like this place better then the others in this genre."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos ever!!!  I've had several other items and all has been really good but today got a bacon & egg breakfast burrito and it stands above anything I've ever had. I'll be back again soon..."}
{"text":"Place is great!! Reminds me of this local joint I love down in San Diego. Great price too, I drove through and got a big shredded chicken burrito for under $6. The burrito has green chilis, onions, sour cream inside and I added beans as well, it hit the spot. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I have to say the food is amazing.  If you like Robertos taco shop you will love this place.  They have a drive thru.  I like the carne asada! My wife said its her new favorite place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great specials, Wednesday 3 fish tacos $5.00! Daily Nacho & Taco specials. Good breakfast too."}
{"text":"Great food great price medium heat. The tacos al pastor had great flavor. Simple corn or flour shell hard or soft. The quality is homemade. The salsas and extra topping bar is self serve. They have a variety of heat on the bar. The nachos with guacamole were a nice side item. Good portions and fast counter service. I would recommend this to anyone anytime of day. They even have great breakfast options."}
{"text":"Their food is way better than other competitors fast food actually take the time to make every dish  I love their beef tacos and the  Asada fries you can tell everything is made fresh and house from scratch good customer service very clean place and their sauces are unlike others"}
{"text":"Today I got a quick bite to eat here for the first time and it  did me justice, I ordered the Nevada burrito and with the surrounding \"Mexican\" food places this one by far the best! I'll be back to try the rest of the menu out.( I love a GOOD burrito and I judge harshly on them. Thank you cooks"}
{"text":"Super delicious. I had the 5 rolled taquitos with lettuce, guacamole, sour cream and cheese."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. It's really good! Much better than Baja Taco which declined fast! Try the nacho burrito! Friendly staff."}
{"text":"So Bomb, the Vegas burrito is my fav we also love their homemade tamales! I highly recommend them to anyone looking to get your Mexican food fix. Way better then Roberto's!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican in Vegas. Not greasy. Tasty. Wide variety on their menu. My favorite item is the shrimp burrito."}
{"text":"I have been here once and it was really good. I came today and it was closed for some boycott!?! Not a very smart business choice."}
{"text":"Amazing! Carne Asada tacos and the Carne Asada Chimichanga were a huge hit with me and my kids. One of which is a pretty picky eater! The fresh salsa was SO good as well. Would have taken pictures but we devoured it all in minutes! Here in Vegas from PA, and it was a TREAT to eat here. Very reasonably priced as well. Hoping to visit again before we leave on Monday. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood go-to for me. It's quick and the food is decent. I like it better than Roberto's down the street but admittedly, I had too much Roberto's in my youth.  I like to eat mostly vegetarian now so I always order the veggie nachos. I pile on some carrots, salsa verde, and extra pico from the bar and it's delish. But I've had these nachos with shredded chicken on occasion and it's pretty good too. Ask for more cheese though as they're a bit skimpy on that. The tacos al carbon were my number one choice for a while because they're great street taco style tacos for only $1 each and you can't beat that.  I've also had the Taco Tuesday special and they were very greasy but yummy. My boyfriend has tried lots of things from here and he likes it all. Nothing amazing, but definitely a good quick Mexican spot.  Also, the people are always really nice whether you go inside or through the drive-thru. I'll keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I got the carne Asada tacos and my boyfriend got the fries. A lot like Roberto's. Not the best tacos I've had but not the worst. I'm sure it would be better after a night out of drinking.  Could have done without the \"guacamole\" on the tacos."}
{"text":"Really fresh food and great flavor. Have been a fan of Roberto's for years. This is very comparable on price and portion. Have had multiple things off of the menu and satisfied with all. Friendly staff as well. Will certainly be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos since living in San Diego!  Try the #38 plate.  Chicken taco al carbon was impressive for only $1.29, a nice surprise because the tortillas tasted home made or at least very fresh.  Good pollo asado has been tough to get in Vegas until stumbling in here, enjoy!"}
{"text":"What happened to the taco shells?! I'm legit sad!! I've been coming here for a year and always ordered the same thing.  One time the cashier messed up my order and faced me shredded beef tacos instead of grounded beef which made me upset. I gave this place the benefit of the doubt and came back because I loved their thick crunchy taco shells.  To my disappointment, the taco shells were replaced with a paper thin taco shell.  My tacos fell apart and were soggy by the time I got home!! On top of that the shell was flavorless. Even jack in the box has sturdier \"taco shells\"!!! Bring back the old taco shells"}
{"text":"Took my daughter for her first experience with Huevos rancheros. Sadly it was rather disappointing she tried green top I tried red both were lackluster. It was clean and the service was quick and accurate but not a place I will go out of my way for."}
{"text":"I am totally in love! I have completely toss Roberto's to the side. This Mexican Grill is so much better! The food is always fresh. Such a well put together and clean place. One of my favorite items to order is the chicken street taco, it comes with cilantro and onions on a corn tortilla with green salsa.   Go after 6 PM ......the street tacos are $1.00."}
{"text":"As we drove by, this place smelled so good that it pulled us right inside.   We ordered tacos al pastor 'street style'. We also got chips with guacamole. Our cashier was super friendly, that is always a plus. The tacos were really hot when they arrived, and they were pretty filling. The flavor was great. Loved their salsa bar. I loved the mild green salsa, and the brown salsa was really spicy. The kind that makes your forehead sweat!  As for the chips and guac, nah. I will pass. Regular tortilla chips, with some sort of melted cheddar on top, and then slathered with an avocado mixture that looks as though it was run through the blender and poured on to the chips. They were just ok. But the tacos! VERY good, and I am glad that we stopped."}
{"text":"Habaneros was so solid overall. I imagine if i was ever feeling something less fancy but with that same quality, I would turn to Habs. I had some fantastic Nachos Al Pastor and enjoyed the flavors over all. The only thing that kept from making this place a 5 is the service experience. I had to ask for salsa, napkins and silverware . Yes , i know - this is typically self service but the containers were cleaned out. Still would recommend this place overall. Quick Eats rock!!"}
{"text":"Much better than the old place that they took over. All good food. $1.00 tacos great. Ate their 3 days in a row tried something different each time. Breakfast was good too. We will return."}
{"text":"Very good! Would take this over Taco Bell and Robertos.. Surprisingly good for fast food. fresh and hot with great flavor"}
{"text":"I pass by this place everyday and I've been dying to try it out. Finally did today! I ordered the rolled tacos combo. Delicious! Everything was great. Generous amount of guac and cheese. The rice was great and the beans tasted less salty than Roberto's which was a plus. Service was great. Food was great. I'm going to try the breakfast menu next! Definitely recommend this place. Yum!"}
{"text":"We came here on cinco de mayo, after realizing most Mexican restaurants had a 1 hour plus wait. The food was mehhhh, it's fast food Mexican after all. I think I loved my fries...so random. The dishes we ordered were j elbow average and the fries was a 3 star for me."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and I have to say it is AMAZING! Tried their churro and it was super fresh and delicious. Everything on the menu looks good! Try their habanero salsa, it's so good."}
{"text":"Needed a quick dinner on Sunday and wanted the BF to try out this great Yelp find.  We took our food to go.  The BF got carnitas nachos and I ordered the shrimp tostado.   He took a bite of my nachos and voila. ...it was a shared order.  There was a large portion of delicious sweet chunky shrimp, marinated perfectly.   The crunchy deep fried corn tortillas  with freshly sliced avocado. YUM!  My BF wanted three more orders.  I think that I will surprise him on the way home!"}
{"text":"Everything was great  Flavor was delicious and they have the salsa bar as well.  Al pastor California style burrito was excellent  Kids had the chicken tacos and taquito  Wifey had the shrimp cheviche"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such high reviews. This place is on the same level, if not a bit worse than Roberto's. First time I went I ordered the Adobada fries and they were just OK definitely not treading into the 5 star realm. Second time I went, I ordered the Carne Asada Torta and again, just OK.. and the fries were absolutely terrible, they weren't salted at all and kind of had that dark orange oil color burnt into them. It's a good place to get some fast, cheap Mexican food (they have a drive-thru), but do not expect it to be of the same quality as somewhere like Tacos El Gordo.  TL;DR: This place is Roberto's Taco shop's little brother."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but make sure you check your order if it's too go. At least 2 out of 5 times my order is wrong. Tonight, it was no tortillas and I didn't notice until I got all the way home."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Shrimp tacos were bomb and being a first time client I can say they definitely won me."}
{"text":"Wish it was a little closer to home but still close enough for a dinner night here and there. Nothing that will blow you away, but just the simple things done well.  I had a carnitas plate, normally you get maybe 3 tacos out if a plate style dish, but I was able to get 5 tacos out of the food on the plate!!! Their horchata is good, not too sweet or milky or too much cinnamon. The carnitas were well flavored, had a nice crisp, and not dry . My girlfriends carne asada was good too. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is my third visit and it's better every time. The staff is friendly and the food is great. I try something different on every visit. This time I had the Carne Asada nachos and a lengua street taco and they were both excellent. They have a small little salsa bar with great salsa and spicy carrots. I love to eat at small family run taco shops and this is one of my favorites now!!"}
{"text":"I've tried the choizo, carne asada, pork carnitas, and the beed tacos.. All have been amazing and very authentic. Great little salsa bar inside as well. Super cheap and they have a drive-thru if you're not up to going inside."}
{"text":"First time here, but the food was good! I ordered the cheese quesadilla and carne asada fries. It came out to a little under $12. The quesadilla was just plain cheese unlike how at Roberto's they put that salsa stuff in it, and I was glad it didn't have that. The fries were cooked really well. They were soft with crispy ends. There was enough carne asada, sour cream, guac and cheese to have some in every bite! I gave 4 stars because even though the fries were good, I felt like it needed something more. I will definitely come here again for their taco Monday's and Tuesday's where their tacos are only $1 so I can try more items on their menu :)"}
{"text":"Not going to lie just stumbled on this joint because I was looking for a Mexican spot that delivers. They are on UberEats and closest to my house so I decided to try it out one day. And not gonna lie I love this place! I love their habanero hot sauce, it gives my meal that kick I need!!   The price point is great and it's worth every penny!! I initially ordered carne asada fries, shredded beef chimichanga and beef tacos. I was surprised at how much was in each combo plate! And I ate every bit of my chimichanga! My fam ate all their plates too and it was sooo good! We compare it Roberto's and hands down I've been coming to Habaneros for months now instead of Roberto's!   I always order a shredded beef chimichanga with hella habaneros sauce because it's life! Only recently I've discovered their chips and guac! It was amazing!! It's their crispy crunchy chips with guac on top with melted shredded cheese and it's delicious! It's like $5 which might be a little pricy, but you get a big wad of chips with more than enough guac and cheese for every bite!   If you're looking for somewhere new but something familiar at the same time! Check out Habaneros! I pretty much crave this spot once a week! OH AND they have a drive thru!!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time and never had any problems but this last time my coworker and I went and got food from here to go and when we sat down to eat. like 6 bites into her food she paused and pull a metal staple shard looking thing out of her mouth. Instantly stopped eating being we were both disgusted and tossed are food. I called the restaurant right after and told the lady she should give her her money back but told me to bring back the food. I was like I think you should just do as I asked or I'll just put this on yelp. Hope the 10$ was worth it. 10/29 @ 7:45pm"}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews but when you bite into a super burrito that has all the fillings including a small rock I cannot forgive.  Taste of the food was decent but you have to wonder about cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"Looks like a fast food dive but the food is surprisingly good! Love the little salsa bar with limes! Carne asada nachos were a great choice! Glad we stopped. Not too badly priced either."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  They have a habanero hot sauce that is acutally Hot, not like other places with a water down version of hot sauce.  The rice and beans are very good.  The place is always very clean and is our new \"Let's get something to eat place\".  I've tried just about every plate on the menu and haven't had an complaints yet.  On a hungover Sunday morning, the Menudo is very good."}
{"text":"Best things on the menu are the steak nachos and three meat breakfast burrito. Not he best Mexican food but better than Rebertos."}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmm, very delicious tacos and burritos!! Go back to the breakfast burrito special you used to have!!"}
{"text":"$1 chicken Taco Tuesday, & $1 Taco Monday. They were amazing also. They have the best tasting chicken tacos in the United States."}
{"text":"Got take out from them. The food was good but they had forgotten our carne asada fries. They gave me a refund and told me they would hook it up if I ever came back"}
{"text":"We love this place... #16 and Lengua taco are our favorite...their chips are the best in town, fresh and warm also the salsa bar is to die for with varieties and freshness, almost forgot to mention about the prices that are very reasonable.  We like to support local who care about quality and service. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Place is always on point...food is fast, authentic, priced well and tasty!  I've never had a bad experience in the 20+ times I've been there...love the   weekly specials...keep em coming for those of us on a budget."}
{"text":"Found this place based on it's Yelp Reviews. Service through the drive thru was good. Got my order right and the food was good. Friendly customer service. Would return here again."}
{"text":"First I'd like to say that the customer service was in fact good, very friendly for being 8am. I have no complaints.  Second, there was nothing gross persay in my food. However, the food tasted like it'd been sitting out since they made it...a month ago. Immediately sick.  Third, I was taken aback by the price looking at the amount of food I was actually given."}
{"text":"Meh burrito I was not impressed. Ingredients were subpar. Just go to Frescas y frijoles more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Pretty average taco shop, better than Robertos at least.. The best thing I had was the carnitas which was actually a little bit crispy like it should be, salsas were good too but overall nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I drove past it many times and never got to stop in. I was told to check out Chili Addiction I walked in, looked at the menu and walked out and went right over to your restaurant. I wanted authentic Mexican food and I got it when I went to Habaneros Taco Grill. Amazing food, fast service, awesome prices. I'll be back again"}
{"text":"This place was ok. I placed a huge order for my family and myself. My cousin boasted about how amazing this place was, and by the look of the yelp pages, the pictures, and what the menu offered, I was excited. I ordered the nacho burrito for its simplicity. My choice of meat, nachos, beans, and cheese. First bite: Hard. I bit into stale nachos and tortilla. Next couple of bites: Where's the cheese? There was no cheese in my nacho burrito, whatsoever. There were no special instructions to take out the cheese or anything, so why am I missing the key ingredient to nachos? I ate it because I was able to put some guacamole and sour cream from my brother's quesadilla plate and make my Terribly Dry and Stale Nacho meal salvageable. The second star is for my family because they like this place and the service isn't bad.  Just never getting that burrito ever again."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Great price. We had the adobada and Carne asada and they were awesome! $5 for 3 with plenty of meat and you can't go wrong! Guacamole is 0.85... Sign me up! And the restaurant is so so so Clean! Family run with passion and flavor! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries are pretty good, we ordered ground beef tacos that were not my favorite but I normally wouldn't order those so I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Best tacos, burritos, drive thru is super fast, salsa is amazing, employees are polite. Can't ask for a better place for my favorite food fix."}
{"text":"My thanks to previous reviewers who gave this fast, casual Mexican food 5 stars. I agree!  Fast. Inexpensive. Delicious. Open late.  I loved my chile relleno and I'll return for many more. Scrumpdelicious melted cheese inside a vegetable is super healthy, right?"}
{"text":"Management must have changed again just recently because we came here not long ago to have some quick eats and the quality of their food has gone down quite a few stars. My family and I were very disappointed. Their Carne Asada was not as flavorful and my favorite on the menu, Chile Relleno, was bland and was not like how it used to be. Hope management can appreciate these reviews and make some changes."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!!!   I had to stop here to grab my friend a drink cause she was dying in my car in this Vegas heat.  This place is a one up version of robertos for sure. Robertos is honestly my go to spot because I'm gross but this place was like the Target of tacos. They have a huge selection of tacos, burritos, and breakfast stuff. Prices are super cheap. What sold me is that they have street tacos.... YESSSSS! They have a super clean restaurant as well as a drive through. I got the carne asada tacos on corn which were fuego. They also have 1$ chicken taco MONDAYS. Yay!!!!  The location is unfortunate, it seemed like a burger joint until I read the sign.   Such amazing food, quality, and prices. I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am from South TX and it's hard to find good Mexican food here but this place is it! It reminds me of a place called Mama Margie's in San Antonio, TX. Their hot sauce is HOT so if you can't do the hot sauce ask them to put it on the side. I ordered the chilaquiles and it was delish. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Their breakfast burritos are tasty, filling and an excellent price. Their tacos, beans and rice are spot on. I highly recommend. The only thing that I didn't care for were the tamales but I really think it is a personal preference."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru and got a burrito and enchilada. The food was extremely hot which was impressive for fast food and it appeared they had just made it fresh but there was limited flavor in the food.  Which usually stands out for a Mexican food with all the seasoning and sauces they use.  I would try this place again to see if it was a once off but if the flavor is missing again next time I won't be back. I'll update this review if the next visit goes well"}
{"text":"This taco joint rocks. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos with rice/beans through the drive thru yesterday and regretted it because when I got home and saw the amount of meat on my tacos, I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it. They were very generous with the meat and I love that they had put guacamole and pico de gallo on the tacos. The meat was so favorable and tasted fresh, I ended up eating all the tacos and was not able to eat too much of the rice/beans that I had ordered even though they tasted really good too. The beans were topped with some cheese which made it extra tasty. Will definitely come back next time I crave tacos n burritos. They have so many different items on their menu and I want to try them all."}
{"text":"Got my lunch about half an hour ago. It's quick and the food is delicious. I love the place. Unfortunately past few weeks when I went there at night time  , the food didn't taste right, something was missing or food was wrapped just in deli paper not in foil. By the time I got home it's not hot anymore and everything is out of bag.  But five stars to guys in the kitchen today, the food was delicious. I got exactly the same like it was at first time when my friend brought me there. All ingredients were perfect amount and it tasted great. Thanks."}
{"text":"I go to the location on Rainbow but it don't see a separate link for them.   This is the best place in Las Vegas to get a breakfast burrito or pick up a quick dinner to take home. Everything I've tried on the menu is delicious and fresh.  Don't go to that other place (starts with an R) Hands down this place is so much better."}
{"text":"Just had the worst customer service possible! Asked for a couple of things to be put on the side due to allergies, it was done backwards. The thing we requested be on the side were not.  When we went to have it fixed we were told we ordered wrong and a replacement would not be made. It's a shame as we use to really enjoy the restaurant but the service has been so bad lately."}
{"text":"This place is eh. Everyone is right about the burritos being all tortilla. I would say spend the extra $5 and go to Roberto's it's way better. Also the customer service is really not good. My boyfriend stood at the counter for about 3-4 solid minutes with a girl with her back to him not helping him because they forgot part of my order. It wasn't terrible but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place the burritos are super tasty and the service is very quick with the food. Usually the burritos are stuffed but im a bit disappointed lately that when I unravel burrito it's been mainly tortilla and a little amount of meat I hope management addresses that because this is literally my favorite burrito place. Fair and competitive prices and amazing flavor. Love that they are open so late too."}
{"text":"I've tried the breakfast and dinner items. I'm not impressed despite the reviews and pics that \"look\" yummy. The breakfast potato, egg, bacon, cheese burrito was so disappointing, dry, lack of flavor and bland. I've had their chicken taquito rolls, decent. Their menudo is greasy and the meat is questionable. Its not bad, it's a fast food so not much to expect."}
{"text":"Decent fast food Mexican food. My bf likes it better than all the Roberto's around here but I think it's pretty comparable."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch and it was not good. Ordered chicken and beef taquitos and they were soggy and didn't have much flavor. The chips in the chilaquiles were burnt. Salsas did not taste good. I gave them 2 stars for their rice, it was decent."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch the other day in what used to be Baja taco. Clean on the inside and the gentlemen at the register was very polite which is always appreciated. Orders rolled tacos (5-3.75) or (3-3.00) I went for five and a carne asada taco. This place is basically like a Roberto's, don tortaco, Faustos etc. good if you're looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This is a the best place for Mexican food. Cheap and good! I can eat here everyday and I'm asIan. Lol.....l"}
{"text":"Unfortunately they don't understand the difference between bacon and steak. I asked for a steak and egg breakfast burrito, corrected the drive thru cashier when the order was incorrect, and still received bacon. The wrapper had steak and egg written on it, with bacon inside. Had to pay extra for the steak, only to receive bacon. Bring back baja taco. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Unknown gem in Summerlin.  Very unimpressive exterior with some quality Mexican food inside. The prices are awesome for the amount of food delivered.   The selection is outstanding and quite varied.  I had a hard time deciding a lunch entree but eventually made a decision.   I am sure that I will be returning and trying other dishes.   Don't expect fancy as this is a old fast food place (Burger King or similar) and the clientele is an indication of the food.   At lunchtime the crowd is mainly Hispanic labor workers which just tells me that the food is good and a good value.    If you want quick and tasty Mexican food, you can't go wrong at Habaneros."}
{"text":"I seen a review that said this is on the same level as rebertos... i have to say to that comment you then lost your mf marbles this place is beyond that... when i order i just orders simple shit i dont order alot of shit to make mfs forget the order.... the simple things in life are sometimes good... But on the flips side shit is bomb.bom had a carne asada burrito and carne asada fries meat cooked just right unlike trash rebertos who keep the meat in a tin can then theu try to re heat it... rebertos is"}
{"text":"Their carnaeasada fries are bomb! It's fresh and of course super filling (definitely can feed two people). I personally like their carnaeasada fries much better than Robertos. I have tried their Torta, tacos, and taquitos.. They're delicious as well.   For sure , must get carnaeasada fries! It will not be a disappointment!"}
{"text":"One of the best quicky Mexican food places in Vegas. Love the habenero salsa(hate I always have to ask for it) and the carne asada burrito was delicious. My wife said the carne nachos were amazing as well.   Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious. Better than Roberto's to me. I live in Los Angeles and still on the hunt for my favorite Mexican spot in Vegas. Rolled tacos are so good and I love the breakfast burritos. Fast and cheap."}
{"text":"Distinctly average Mexican fare; the good news is it is cheap. Roughly six bucks for a filling burrito. I'd rather pay a little more and have a better meal, but if you want something cheap, you can certainly do worse."}
{"text":"Been here nor than I've checked in. A go to spot. Not sue how they treat workers but food is good and consistent. Service varies but I'm a late hours person, so...."}
{"text":"GREAT VALUE! Burritos were loaded with meat, tacos were really tasty. They have $1 special on tacos Monday and Tuesday (beef Monday, chicken Tuesday). I was stuffed for under $10. They also serve breakfast items all day."}
{"text":"Formerly Baja Taco which was horrible. This place was actually really really good. I came here yesterday and idk if it's because I was sooooo hungry but the food was delicious. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos, nothing special because it's my safe food when I try a new Mexican joint. The tortillas appear to be handmade, nice and thick so they don't fall apart when you load up on sauce. The meat was seasoned perfectly. Huge portion comes with pico, and guac. I got some spicy red sauce for them and ohhhh sweet Jesus was it delicious. The 2 tacos I ordered came out to about $6 because they're not your average taco truck tacos. These things were massive. He gave them to me in a carne asada nachos container to be able to hold both. Super yum. I'll definitely be back. Sooo glad Baja Taco is gone or under new management because they sucked the big one back when they were open."}
{"text":"Always have had great food here, and great service. I love their tamales, tacos, and of course the habanero hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through uber eats. When it came the order was completely screwed up. Probably would be pretty good if I got what I ordered."}
{"text":"This place is very close to my house and I come here very often. I have tried a lot of different things, they are not always hits for me. However, I am addicted to their carnitas plate. It's big enough for at least 2 meals. Also, you just can't beat the house made flour tortilla. Overall, a very solid place with drive through."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I always order carne asada nachos with everything on it. The meat is very flavorful well seasoned, Chips are always hot n fresh. They give you a pretty big portion as well. The  beef tamales are to die for. Just good quality food compared to all the other taco shops. Definitely worth the 20 min drive"}
{"text":"first of all the person who took my order was very attentive considering it was my first time ordering. I had ordered a chicken tamales plate. As soon as I got to the drive thru she repeated my order of a pork tamales I corrected it & said it was chicken. She told the person in the back making my order for chicken instead of pork so assuming as I got home that my order was correct. As soon as took a bite of the first tamale, they skimped me out on the chicken barely anything in the tamale. The second tamale was pork, person making it thought I couldn't tell the difference between pork and chicken. Thanks but no thanks I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mexican food place I've ever been to. We decided to go to this place since my husband loves Mexican food. The workers are super friendly! Food came out fast and was delicious. We ordered #9 carnitas, #10 carne asada, #15 chimichanga, #25 milaneasa de res and ceviche tostada de camaron. Restroom was extremely clean and smelled good. They have great soap that kills the finger taco smells. Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This place is legit!  My favorite is the carne asada burrito.  And, I'm not sure what they do to their soda, but the Dr. Pepper is mixed perfectly!"}
{"text":"Went last night for Taco Tuesday! The guy at the counter was friendly and assisted us in ordering. We had street tacos - Carne Asada, Carnitas, Al Pastor - ALL GREAT! Also had a Crispy Chicken Taco on special for $1 - Almost thought it was better than the others. Rice and beans were good. All three salsas were very very good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"All hail Habanero's! So glad to finally discover a good burrito joint on the west side. Even better that it has great hours, a drive through and so affordable.  I usually get either a surf and turf(not on the menu) or a chile relleno burrito. Both or legit and they def don't skimp. Along side is usually carne asada fries, plain churro and a horchata. Can I say that none of these fall short of quality? This is as close to the border taste as I can get on the west side of Vegas. And oh, the salsa options are amaze balls. Esp the salsa verde.  Last words? Buh bye Roberto's!!!!!"}
