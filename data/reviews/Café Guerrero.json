{"text":"If you find yourself in this no man's land area of Montreal - this place is a great place to eat! It's on the ground floor of an office building, which you'd think would make for a lazy, processed, overpriced java-u situation - BUT NO! The menu changes daily, is small but has everything you need - a salad option, a soup, a vegetarian dish, and a meat dish - as well as sandwiches. Everything I've eaten here has been delicious. Their Buddha bowls, their soups, their Asian noodle salad. Fresh ingredients, generous portions and well priced. Best brownies in Montreal too. I am so thankful for this place - as being the only option in the neighbourhood it could have the tendency to suck as many of the office building cafes have - I thank these guys everyday! Service is always with a smile even during the busy lunch hour and such friendly staff who remember the names of favourite orders of all their customers. You can order your lunch online in advance and set a time to pick it up.  Everything is very clearly made with love.  Please don't ever change - you guys are on point!!"}
