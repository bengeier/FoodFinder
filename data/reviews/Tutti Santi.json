{"text":"It was fabulous! We sat at the bar and the bar tender took amazing care of us,helped us choose the perfect wine with the best dishes.  Gave us a complimentary coffee liquor at the end of the meal.  Dinner and salad was amazing. He also enhanced my pasta with some spicy jalape√±o olive oil. A lively experience with excellent food. When you open the doors through this strip mall restaurant, you enter Italy!!"}
{"text":"So very good. I had the seafood raviolis and they were perfection. One bite in I could taste the quality. The service was impeccable and so warm. The only reason  this is not a five star review is they are a little pricey. I see many more date nights being spent here."}
{"text":"Fantastic hand-made pastas.  The ravioli and gnocchi were amazing.  Brought the family in for a nice dinner over spring break.  Service was attentive and spot-on.  Wine was good but expensive.  Half- orders of spaghetti bolognese were plenty for my daughters."}
{"text":"A business associate raved about this restaurant in Scottsdale, and we had out of town guests we wanted to impress.  Very overpriced for very poor quality food.  We ordered  the mushroom appetizer and the mushrooms were tough and the filling was cold.  We also ordered the calamari and it was tough and appeared to be prepared from pre-battered frozen calamari.
The pasta seemed like it had been prepared earlier and then reheated.
The tables were really close and we felt cramped.
Waiter was very pleasant, but certainly doesn't make up for the atrocious food,
We've actually had better food at the Olive Garden!!!!!"}
{"text":"Genuine italian old-style restaurant where the food as well the service lived up to my high expectations. Well worth the relatively high prices. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Always good- the pastas are generous and flavorful. The veal dishes are very traditional without being heavy. Cappachio chilled , thin and tasty. I think this is a great place to meet friends or bring out of towners. I have been a fan of Chef Nina and her restaurants for many many years."}
{"text":"Like others, I was brought here by the good reviews; especially those of the gnocchi, which is probably the only type of Italian food I'd pay money to go out and eat (y'know, spaghetti and all that pasta-y type stuff is so easy to make at home. Ever try making gnocchi? I have, pain in the ass).

Run-on parenthesis sentences aside, I wouldn't say I was blown away by the gnocchi as other reviewers. However, I did enjoy it. Along with that, our server was both attentive and actually *from* Italy, which kind of adds to the experience. The complimentary bread is probably the best I've had in an Italian restaurant; very soft and the crust isn't too hard like most places.

One star off for the on-table plates having what looked like grease smudges and the stupid \"that's what she said\" joke one of the bussers at the wait station (which was unfortunately right next to our table) uttered.

Other than that, I'll just add that I don't find the portion sizes to be as great a value as other reviewers suggested, but maybe I'm being a fatty.

All-in-all, a nice place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and these people. Even though they barely know me haha. Ambience is good for dates to dinner parties. The bar is quaint and intimate. The food is fresh and authentic. Ugh the ravioli and calamari are amazing. You won't want any other Italian after you've had some tutti Santi. I send my guests here all the time and they always have a good time and love the food. They never disappoint."}
{"text":"AMAZING! We were sat immediately (since we did have a reservation). Our server forgot about us to the point that we had no water or drinks placed, OR menu's after sitting for about 10 mins. We had to ask another server to take care of us. After this minor issue... we were off...

The recommendations made were right on point! Home made Ravioli was to die for!! that was 1 app & the calamri was so good... House salads were served right before our entrees. No complaints either. All green! I cant stand iceberg lettuce or white lettuce in my salads. 

For entrees I ordered the Linguine with Clams in a white sauce which was delicious! My partner was absolutely satisfied with his meal although I cant remember for the life of me what he ordered! lol

They gave complimentary peppermint sambuca type drinks after dinner... a nice touch for clam & calamari breath. 

It is inside a strip mall which does not add sex appeal, but than again we were there to eat!  

I literally cannot wait to go back. Ok my mouth just watered thinking about the Ravioli! May be visiting tonight!"}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying we have been into Tutti Santi for a couple years... and a couple weeks ago were inspired to brag. The Carpaccio ap is wonderful- if there is a prosciutto melon that is just as good. Don't skip on the garlic bread and olive oil...it pairs perfectly with a Caesar with anchovies. Robbie- stop giving us such wonderful super Tuscan's ... or don't... the wine is wonderful as is your hospitality. Have been in the industry for over 15 years and we can't thank you enough for our experiences there. 

Try the house penne- artichoke and watercress with plenty of garlic... and order the tiramisu ahead of time with your ouzo! It runs out fast. Bon Appetite!

{"text":"GREAT! We found this restaurant near our hotel (the Westin Kierland Villas) on Yelp.  Read the great reviews and decided to try it.  Our family of 4 (our daughters are 11 and 8) went without a reservation.  Turns out the reviews are absolutely right!  Though it's wildly popular, they were able to find us a spot at the bar (which was a memorable experience for our girls who, being from Washington State, can't step foot in a bar), where we had an amazing dinner with service that was as good as the food.  Our 11 year old daughter, an aficionado of ravioli :) , thought this was the most delicious ravioli she'd ever tasted.  (I agree! It's right up there with the best. The chicken parmigiana and spaghetti pomodoro were excellent, too!)  We were extremely happy with the whole experience and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My brother and I dig this place, esp the vibe dining in the bar! This week, Matteo at the bar took amazing care of us (ask him for his secret infused olive oil!) and the cioppino (gotta ask) w/some angel hair was stellar. Not sure the menu suits you? Ask them to make you something - bet you they will!  
Incredible place - incredible people - amazing food - what else could you want??"}
{"text":"My husband, son and I just had dinner at Tutti Santi. We read the positive reviews and upon seeing that it was right near the pointe Hilton where we were staying we went there for dinner. The ambiance with the low lighting and an intimate setting was lovely. The calamari appetizer was very good and the dinner salad was simple and delicious, the main course was excellent. My husband and I each had veal dishes and my so had pasta. The pasta was perfectly cooked. The veal was tender and very tasty. The service was excellent and they even had a magician to entertain the guests. I would highly recommend this resteraunt for dinner."}
{"text":"The best ravioli I've ever had.  And the gnocchi was wonderful as well.  The pasta is all so fresh - anything must be good here.  Great waiters - and flaming shot of sambuca with coffee beans to wish on at the end...nice touch."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by the hotel staff where we stayed while out of town. The place was packed and seemed like it was worth the wait. The food was delicious and everyone at our table  enjoyed their meal. Nina, the owner, greeted all the guests and was lovely. Great meal and ambiance. We liked it so much we went back the next night!!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant upon the recommendation of a friend.  The food was great but the service was really bad.  It took our waiter (Giovanni)at least 10 minutes to even bring us water. We ordered the house ravioli which was perfect. When he told us he would give us a few minutes to order we told him we were ready now. He said I'll be right back but he disappeared to help another party. After about 10 minutes we said something but he still didn't appear. This was a full 40 minutes since we had sat down and it was an 8:30 reservation. His service was so bad that I had to get up again and ask for a waiter that would actually pay attention to us. This ruined the evening for me. He finally appeared but I was really agitated by then.   The saving grace was that the food was great. Our friends did tell us to ask for Maria but we didn't get her.  If I lived here I would go back but I would request that Giovanni not be out waiter."}
{"text":"Yes, five stars. The food is dependably great, staff is seasoned and professional while making you feel at home, and the ambiance works for everything from a corporate group dinner to a romantic night out. The wine list has something for everyone, the bartenders are pros and know how to pour a drink. If forced to \"complain\" I would wish the bread was a crustier artisan variety, but that is kind of pathetic when the house-made veal cannelloni or ravioli is melting in your mouth while your mind is back in Italy somewhere."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Rome and I can honestly say Tutti I Santi has the true Italian flavors and welcoming atmosphere!!!!
The carpaccio appetizer and the burrata are my very favorites to begin an amazing dinner!
The ravioli are definitely a staple, light and flavorful they leave you wanting always more!!!!! The veal cannelloni are amazing as well! 
As second entree I tried the Milanese pork and the prior  to that the chicken Della Casa... Everything was outstanding! 
The service is phenomenal and the staff and Leo ( the owner) are friendly and lovely people.
Before you leave you have to splurge with torrincino dessert..... Your welcome people!!!!! Buon appetito!!!!"}
{"text":"Rude male waiter, receipt charges didn't match menu, under cooked garlic in the shrimp scampi.  Menu said scampi was $16 - receipt said $22.  Nice ambiance, calamari and chicken parm were very good too, but that's about it for this night.  Side waiters were very pleasant and attentive though."}
{"text":"Highly impressed right from the get go.  Perfectly decorated, lighting was great, gave me an Manhattan or chicago Italian restaurant type of vibe.  Server was something else.  Very genuine and personable, felt like we've known him for years.  Proper size and portion of Shrimp.  Tiramisu was to die for.  If  I lived within a short distance, I'd be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"A coworker and I went to this restaurant on the way to the airport to leave Phoenix. We were seated and it took quite a while for our waiter(ponytailed man who looked homeless) to bring our drinks, the restaurant wasn't even very busy. He was kind and did not appear as though he was happy to serve us. I ordered the lasagna, and was very pleased with the food itself. The problem was that there wasn't enough of it! The portions could easily be doubled! We had a flight to catch so we asked our waiter for the check and TOLD HIM we had a flight to catch. We waited about 10 minutes for Mr. Ponytail to bring the check. Then once he eventually came back to pick it up, it took him another 15 minutes to count change and bring it back. While we are waiting for our change to come back, Mr. Ponytail is spending his time watching the magician! What, is somebody else counting our change for him?! Or is he just making us wait on purpose knowing that we had a plane to catch?! I don't know what Mr Ponytail's intentions were, but I do know that he was an awful waiter and the service we received from him was pitiful. However, the Hispanic man refilling our drinks and taking our empty plates was very polite and moved quick to get things done. Overall, the food itself was good, but the portions were way too small. The poor experience was 90% due to the terrible service. Had the service been good, I would have rated this place 4/5 stars, but dirty old Mr Ponytail ruined that review for you."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday, and we absolutely loved it!! The place was an authentic Italian restaurant that looked like it was in Italy. The food was so delicious all 3 courses. The staff was very friendly. Would highly recommend this restaurant, cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I love Tutti Santi on 16th St! The service is always top-notch. The setting is authentic Italian. It is the one place in town where I can get orange roughy-my favorite fish. It is prepared in the most divine lemon/caper sauce with artichoke hearts-truly spectacular. I love the flaming Sambuca at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"This is an old school Italian restaurant. They have the best cheese ravioli! My boyfriend really likes the spaghetti bolognese, and pays the extra $3 to add sausage, it's worth it. The house salad the food comes with is very small, but you also get bread so it all evens out."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. Lovely menu does not produce fruit of Italian cuisine. Orange Roughy turned back for teasing like an omelette. Penne under cooked for someone who appreciates al dente. Service presumptive in the wrong ways."}
{"text":"I was really expecting more after reading all the great reviews but the food seemed very average at best. The Gnocchi was all I tried and it was passable but uninspiring. They were fairly gummy and dense and not particularly pleasing but not completely bad. The serving size was substantial though, so it could be a good place for those looking for larger portions.  The service was pretty decent and probably the highlight of my visit."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian food ever.. I'm very picky and even pickier is my daughter and she in in love with the ravioli di Nina just like her momma!!!  Yummy :)"}
{"text":"Great service and good food for the price.  It has a fairly elegant atmosphere, and the staff is very well trained and professional.  It was a very fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Had a birthday party here, and it was great! We all enjoyed our food, and the servers were very nice when we stayed so late!"}
{"text":"Simple THE BEST ravioli in the state of Arizona. Hands down. Homemade deliciousness in a cream and tomato sauce. The other food is all very good, as well, but it's the ravioli that draws me back again and again. Prices are on the higher side - you don't get great value for basics like apps, salads, etc. - but for the handmade pastas, totally worth it, especially since they come with soup or salad! Service is always attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to this tutti santi numerous times over the past 5 years. Last night we decided it was time to indulge once more. 

We ordered the gnocchi as well as the daily special, lobster ravioli. I normally scarf a plate of gnocchi as they are handmade and delicious. Needless to say, I was scared to venture out my box.

The gnocchi were divine as usual...handmade daily, with the perfect mix of white sauce and bolognese. The lobster ravioli were delicious. Also, freshly made topped with an awesome vodka sauce. Furthermore, the lobster was so fresh, as if it was still swimming in the ocean.

To put the finishing touch on our wonderful dinner experience, our server brought over the signature shots of flaming sambuca, including the \"three flies\" (as they are called), symbolizing the past, present and future...If I had to predict the near future, I would say that we will be back soon.

Finally, our server was awesome and friendly. After all, you can't have a perfect dinner with shitty service."}
{"text":"A group was in there on Tuesday night April 26 during an out-of-town business trip. Five out of eight got food poisoning and all 5 ate the Caesar salad. It's unfortunate because we liked this place. However when they were called on it they were in denial and would not own the issue. Never going back here again.  Sad thing is how many other people got food poisoning that night."}
{"text":"First time trying Tutti Santi at the recommendation of a friend for our 16th Anniversary and it does not dissapoint. The service was great and the food was better. I had the tortellini pana rosa and my wife had the ravioli."}
{"text":"Been there so many times over the years,  Food is great!  and I have always had great service. But our visit this past Monday night was so disappointing.  The server that waited on us does not belong waiting on tables, he had a bad attitude and made our dining experience unforgettable.  His tip reflected the bad service (and very lucky he even received a tip) He followed us out the door and thru his hands up in the air saying \" what the F@#&! \"  I would have given him 0 tip, and wrote in \"find a new job!!!!  Gratuity is earned and should not be expected!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there on a busy Friday night after calling about 45 minutes before for reservations.  We got a terrific seat a booth near the bar which was exactly what we had hoped.  The server was terrific, in fact the entire wait staff was very well trained.  We had a minor issue with a pepper mill which was resolved immediately without a call for help...they just noticed and solved the problem.  The food was excellent.  He had salad, veal saltimbocca and I had soup of the day (mushroom) and the eggplant parmesean.  The eggplant was baked not fried which made for a light vegetarian entree.  Our bottle of wine (brunella) opened up quickly and was a good value.  No room for dessert which looked delicious as we saw it go by.  A complimentary glass of grappa made up for it.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Caesar salad was too cheesy, tomato meatball soup okay. The special Fettuccini n shrimp was delish as was the ravioli. Meal actually ended stronger than it started with the creme brulee and sambuco shot.  Might stop by again if in the area but wouldn't make a special trip. Service was good! Would have done 4 stars but knocking off a star because too pricy for what you get."}
{"text":"Thank you, Tutti Santi, for the best ravioli I've ever had. Great service and fun ambiance also. Waiter had a great sense of humor and made us feel like we were dining at home."}
{"text":"Stuffed mushrooms were to die for, service was impeccable and the specials were original and tasted phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife, as we try a new place for dinner every week. I was recommended this spot by a co-worker. The food and ambiance was great. The service was substandard. The waiter was rude and not very attentive. He seemed as if our presence was bothersome. I hate it when people put their personal feelings out at work. Get over yourself and do your job."}
{"text":"So my guy and I went out for a special evening and decided to eat at Tutti Santi's in Scottsdale and to say that it was disappointing in putting it mildly! Service was not good and the food left a lot to be desired. Everyone around us was offered after dinner drinks but we were not. Our bread was cold. Our waitress and other staff were inattentive. They tried to take my guys plate before he completed his meal. I was very disappointed. The only sunshine in this place was the hostess. She was a wonderful person! For the price I could have done better at Carraba's!"}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant the food is the real deal the service is fabulous the wine selection is average...the bread which I love my bread was just OK but honestly the food is legit"}
{"text":"I love Italian restaurants, and this one did not disappoint. The atmosphere was outstanding - quiet, quaint and relaxing. The service was great as well. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and right there when we needed her. And the food was delicious. Our appetizers, entrees and desserts were just to die for. I honestly can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, just love this place. Family owned and operated!"}
{"text":"I've visited Tutti Santi several times over the past few years, last time at the now-defunct Glendale location about 3 years ago, and the food and service were consistently fantastic.  It was based on those experiences that for my birthday, I selected Tutti Santi - Phoenix for my husband and adult son and I to visit (we almost went to Sassi in North Scottsdale, but were worried about the PGA crowd).  But Tutti Santi has never disappointed...until tonight.

Don't get me wrong, the food was still very good - except that the food we wanted wasn't available (why list Gnocchi on the menu if you're not going to have it?). Given that, I selected the Ravioli, my husband selected the Fetticcini (sp) and Shimp, and my son selected the Tortellini - all very good, except the shrimp had the tails not detached, a personal preference thing. Warm bread was very good, and we shared a dessert of Cheesecake which was delicious.  Wines were all very good, and we had by the glass wine, very nice selection.

The service, however sunk it.  The waiter came over, seemed rushed, and asked if we wanted something to drink, pretty much as we were just handed the menus, we were looking at the wine list at the time.  My husband and I quickly selected a glass each, and the waiter took away the menu before my son could select one (he ultimately ordered the Malbec - wonderful selection).  The waiter, who never did introduce himself, shared with us the specials (Cippino and a Chicken Marsala/Sausage dish), took our order for one Fetticcini dish and two Gnocchi dishes.  He came back to let us know that they were out of Gnocchi (at 6pm?  Was there a rush at lunch for plates of Gnocchi?), then when I asked about the chicken special, he corrected himself and said it was a veal special.  He also had a very difficult time remembering if we had one salad and two soups, or one soup and two salads, but he did bring it out correctly.  Meals came out well-timed....and that was the end of the service.  We had to wait 20 minutes after we had completed our menus to have our plates cleared, another few minutes for the waiter to come back and ask about dessert, and then another 15-20 minutes to get our single slide of cheesecake.  Then another 20 minutes to get the check, which was an interesting experience, as the waiter told us he was doing better because he had taken a 'shot' (of what, we wondered?  Medicine? Booze?  Heroin?  what? TMI) as he dropped off the check.

For not too much more money (we spent $100 for the three of us), we could have eaten in many different places and received great service as well as great food.  

My recommendation - if you don't care about the service, but like good Italian food, try Tutti Santi.  I would avoid this restaurant at all cost for any special occasions - which is sad because it didn't used to be that way."}
{"text":"What a delight to dine at Tutti Santi! The service was so good and the waiter was attentive and knowledgeable.  We didn't have a reservation for a Sunday evening but I think that the next time we do we will make one. We had a salad to start that was made of fresh tomatoes, basil and olives. It had the most creamy cheese with it that just made the whole salad taste amazing. The lentil soup followed with generous portions of vegetables and a very flavorful broth. I had the ravioli and my husband had the mussels and calamari on spaghetti. Both of us we please with our choices. Portions were huge and came out hot from the kitchen. We did no have room for dessert but did enjoy the sambuka  with the espresso beans in it. We did not find the prices that high with all you get in the meal. The soup or a starter salad are included in the meal price and there is a continuous supply of fresh bread brought to the table. Take a drive further down the street to  this little gem nestled unexpectedly next to a Fry's grocery store in a strip mall.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was sad when glendale location closed. The food is excellent. I sat in bar great service the calamari was excellent. I will return."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Truly authentic Italian dishes. From the appetizers to the desserts, everything was perfect. Including the espresso which was the best we have had since being in Italy!  The service was excellent as well. Everyone was very kind and helpful. We felt like part of the family."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a Groupon, which indicated reservations were required. When we arrived at the restaurant, we wondered why it was a requirement, since there were only maybe 3 other couples in the restaurant. Granted, it was a Sunday night, but still, it was a little quiet in there.

The atmosphere was nicely decorated, but still, it was too quiet for us to feel comfortable talking in anything much more than a whisper.

Our server was a bit too clingy and sweet. She kept saying, \"thank you very much, thank you so much\" after everything; after sitting down and handing us our menu, after ordering, after removing the dishes, after placing the bill on the table. She was just a little off-putting. There was another waiter there, and he seemed genuine and friendly, and normal, but alas, our experience with him was only for him to remove some of our dishes.

When we decided on an appetizer, the beef carpaccio, and when we requested it, the waitress responded with a weak sounding, \"Oh, I don't have that.\" There was no apology, or suggestion for another menu item, or an explanation. So we decided on the escargot, and in the meantime, some semi-burned, or over-toasted bread arrived. It was okay to soak up the spinach sauce that came with the already de-shelled escargot (they took away my favorite part!). They were okay, but nothing spectacular.

My boyfriend got the seafood pasta special, which again, was just okay. I had the stuffed pork chop with baked fingerling potatoes, and while the pork chop was delicious, the potatoes were too salty. Both dishes came with soup or salad, and I got the vegetable lentil soup, which was quite tasty. The salad was nothing special.

Dessert was house-filled cannoli, and a mascarpone cheesecake. Both desserts were pretty good, but not spectacular. Two shots of complimentary sambuca, arrived with dessert. The sambuca was tasty, but too strong for my liking.

When we received the check, the waitress said, \"Thanks so much, and have a good evening,\" but we hadn't even paid! We finally paid the remaining balance after several minutes, and left.

The thing that left a bad taste in our mouths after we left, was that they charged our cards incorrectly (we had split the bill). Extra charges showed up on my statement for about a week, including $70 of extra charges. Eventually, the correct charges appeared, but it was just one more thing that felt a little off about the evening.

Maybe if the meal wasn't quite so expensive, and the service wasn't so awkward, Tutti Santi on Greenfield would have been a much better experience. Next time, I'll go to Christos."}
{"text":"Excellent place and food. Good service. Very busy, make a reservation if you don't want to wait even on a week night."}
{"text":"Italian food is typically not my first choice of cuisine, but I had guests in town and they wanted Italian food. I had been to this restaurant about 3 times prior but cannot remember enjoying the food as much as I had today.  This restaurant is truly worth the 5 stars.  
Starts out with a warm greeting and fantastic service through and through.
Yes, Ravioli ala Nina is amazing. They make the pasta paper thin and stuff it with fresh cheese and spinach.  The cream sauce and marinara sauce on top is so delicious.  Love the Veal Francese.  They don't skimp on the veal in this dish.  Food came out so hot and had plenty of the veal, capers, mushrooms, capers, artichokes,  and a savory lemon sauce.  The pasta side dish has a really delicious, really fresh marinara sauce.  
They finish your meal w/ a complimentary Sambuca!  We did not have a reservation, but it's a good idea to make one if you can.
Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Love how consistent Tutti Santi has remained over the years!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have a timeshare nearby and when we were doing a morning walk we saw this place and we asked our concierge she raved. We went and fell in love with the place. The service, the food, the friendship. We go back every time we are in town and the staff remembers you. Also my wife loves gnocchi and says that these are as good as her grandmother's.

{"text":"This restaurant is amazing the staff was amazing.  They were always smiling even though they were extremely busy for valentines day.  They were on top of everything making sure our glasses were filled, dirty dishes taken away and ensuring we were always comfortable.  The food was over the top.  I am italian so i find it very hard to go out to dinner at italian restaurants because nothing is like a home made meal.  But this restaurant made me feel like i was at home.

I am a concierge for a hotel in North Phoenix and will be recommending this to anyone looking for Italian food.  Keep up the good work Tutti Santi."}
{"text":"Found Tutti's through Yelp and thought we would give it a try. Extremely glad that we did. The food is amazing, everything we had! Highly recommend the ravioli and the tiramisu. Our service was excellent and they made the whole dining experience very enjoyable. I did not feel rushed and it was the first meal I've eaten in a long time that lasted more than an hour. Each item was given adequate time for us to experience and enjoy before they came to ask what we would like for dinner or desert or another drink. The waitress was friendly, Lauren I believe, and her recommendations were helpful. The hostess was a little cold and stuffy when we first went in which almost made us double think our choice but the rest of the experience was great!"}
{"text":"Tutti Santi is a solid regular stop for us & our friends.  We probably eat there once every month.  Certainly a joy to go there. It is no Marcellino's, but it is a good value.  I had the veal osso bucco. It came on a bed of saffron risotto.  Very nice!  Flavorful & tender.  Bread is satisfactory, not great.  Service is good. 

I do disagree on their tipping guide.  Nice that they include one, but the amount of the tip includes the tax.  I don't think most restaurants expect customers to tip on a sales tax that has no impact on service."}
{"text":"I'd give 2.5 stars if I could. As others have mentioned, the food here is good. The service, however, was lacking in many aspects. We were so looking forward to dining here after it was highly recommended by a friend whose family eats here every time they are in town as well as all of the glowing Yelp reviews.   Unfortunately, we left with a bad taste in our mouths.  

We were greeted cordially and seated promptly, but then waited for someone, anyone, to approach our table for a long time.  The waiter and waitress both looked over at us several times, but neither came to greet us or ask for our drink order or even to tell us they were busy and would be with us in a few minutes.  I have no problem if someone is slammed, but a little communication is nice.  Anyway, the waitress finally came over to us and mentioned that she was stepping in for the other waiter because he was too busy, but the entire meal we felt like we were an afterthought and she never really listened to how everything was or if we needed anything else. The kicker was that EVERY other table was brought complimentary shots of sambuca after their meals except for us.  

The food was good, especially the ravioli and tiramisu. But I would have enjoyed the meal a lot more if we had had the service given to everyone else in the restaurant. There are enough other choices that appreciate my business."}
{"text":"Another good Tutti Santi in my neighborhood.!   Food is quite good and the wine by the glass has some exceptional treats.   Staff is friendly, available and happy to help.    Too bad Amarone declined and died here but Tutti Santi is a welcome addition!!!!!"}
{"text":"Do not pass this place up just because it is hidden inside a strip mall. 

The dining room ambience is just as high quality as the nicest restaurants in the valley. Low lighting, linen tablecloths and napkins, and light music all make this place amazing to spend a few hours in. 

The service is relaxed and well paced, allowing you to fully enjoy each course before bringing anything else forward. 

The food is 100% authentic italian. I had the Pollo Caprese and it was probably the best I've ever had in my life. Just the right amount of fresh mozzarella over seasoned tomato and chicken. Came with a side of spaghetti, which was also the perfect consistency and flavor. 

As an added bonus, our waiter actually spoke italian! Give this place a shot, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great place for delicious food, attentive service and a charming atmosphere - including a little Italian serenade, if you're lucky."}
{"text":"My family and I dined at Tutti Santi during family vacations to Scottsdale for the last 2 years.  It is an authentic East Coast Italian restaurant in the heart of Scottsdale, AZ!  The caprese salad is as good as I've had anywhere and the beef carpaccio is a can't miss.  The waitstaff is warm and attentive and good with kids.  If you are craving authentic Queen's style Italian in the South West, this is the place!"}
{"text":"The ambience, the service is incredible. Great place for lunch or meeting or romantic dinner.The food  quality is always on point , always consistent.Best homemade Italian food ever."}
{"text":"The BEST Italian food I have had in Arizona, Tutti Santi in Gilbert has everything you could ask for in an Italian Restaurant. The Veil Marsela is outstanding as well as the Capellini del Dottore and the Mussels and Calamari Fra Diavola. From the bread to the dessert everything was delicious.

The service was excellent as well our waiter took great care of us making sure everything tasted good and things were ok. The music was soft and the mood was peaceful, great place to have a romantic night. 

It is the nicest place I have been in a while and I will make sure to return again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is so nice and loves kids. Food is fantastic, especially the linguini with clams - white sauce.  Great atmosphere and feels like you are right at home."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Pointe Hilton and figured to give this place a try after reading all the great reviews and seeing it was close.  I had the Chicken Al Momento , with salad and a cup of cream of  mushroom soup .  The salad was a balsamic vinigerette and it was pretty lame. It only came with one small tomato slice and no onions or pepperincinis like you get at many Italian Restaurants. The soup was ok and the Chicken Al Momento was ok , but it was served on a very small bed of spaghetti , I mean a box of pasta is about a buck and a half , put some more on the plate. The menu at this Phoenix location was very limited and being from Chicago I had higher expectations."}
{"text":"I went here a few months ago for my mom's birthday and I have to say it was great.  I live right by Tutti and I had never been inside.  I loved the appetizers the wine and that great hot food that was served to us.  

The best part was the birthday shot that my mom, dad, myself AND the server took."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Tutti Santi last night. First of all the food was good. I had a veal dish that was cooked exactly as I ordered it. My friend had the lasagna which was good but not inspired. The Caesar salad was fine (delicious anchovies!) and my octopus was okay although I've had better. The bread was generic and it took two tries to get someone to bring us butter. The service was slow and spotty just like it was the only other time I was here. The server could not have been nicer but after the appetizers were delivered she was pretty much absent. My big complaint is about the reaction of two men who work at the restaurant when I pointed out that there was quite a bit of sediment at the bottom of my glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo (which had been ordered as a single glass). When I told the man behind the bar that they should decant this wine in the future he told me they never decant this wine at their restaurant and that the sediment was normal (yes it is but it should not be poured into the glass). A second man chimed in and said that the sediment was in the wine because it was a young 2011 wine. Huh?... I told him I didn't think that was the reason for the sediment and he started to argue with me, so I just turned and left the restaurant (I had already paid my bill). Sediment is not dangerous it is just unsightly and unpleasant if it ends up in your mouth. What I really didn't like was what I felt was an \"in-your-face\" reaction to me pointing out a problem with my wine and suggesting a solution so that it wouldn't happen in the future. Last comment... Tutti Santi uses very cheap \"entry level\" stemware for their wines by-the-glass even though some of their offerings are in the $15 per glass range. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem. The food was fantastic. A little bit of Italy in Phoenix. Everything we had tasted fresh and perfectly seasoned. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"In my line of work I am fortunate to eat quite a bit in restaurants but have to say my visit to Tutti Santi was by far the most awkward and just uncomfortable restaurant visits I have ever experienced  The only reason I am not ranking this a 1 star or below is that the food was quite good. I had the ravioli - the sauce was an exceptionally nice balance of tomatoes and cheese. The pasta was a bit undercooked but not so undercooked the food couldn't be eaten. I ate most of it and actually enjoyed it. My daughter's spaghetti was good. The problem was the service, cleanliness and overall awkward ambiance. 
We arrived around 5:30 on a Sautrday evening. Only one other table was occupied at the time so they were not busy. We were seated and looking at the menu when the waiter ( who didn't bother to introduce himself) arrived at the table and asked what we wanted to drink. I gave my order but I guess my daughter was taking too long to decide and he glared at her and said \"hello\" in a snarky tone then without waiting for her reply, announced he'd return later. He scurried off and moments later we heard yelling coming from what I assume was the kitchen - and not just friendly, kitchen banter - this was full-on name calling and swearing  - it appeared to be some dispute amongst the Staff. There was no attempt amongst them to hash out their issues discretely - their fight was overheard by everyone in the dining room. There were six people in the dining room at the time - me and my daughter and two other couples. It was clear we all heard the cussing and yelling but nobody in management bothered to offer an apology to the customers- there was no attempt to put the customers at ease. 
When our waiter returned, he announced that he had forgotten to tell us about the specials but said he assumed we didn't want to hear about them anyway - another awkward moment as we still don't know why the waiter would have assumed such a thing.
We finally ordered - I originally ordered gnocchi- which I was looking forward to but a few minutes after our order was put in I was advised by the waiter (whose name we still did not know) that the gnocchi was not yet made. I ordered ravioli as a backup. Salads arrived fairly quickly and consisted of lettuce, one slice of a mushy tomato covered in a pretty tasty vinaigrette. 
Food arrived soon after. There was no offer from the waiter to top with freshly ground pepper or fresh Parmesan but there was a bowl of dried Parmesan on the table and salt and pepper shakers so no real surprise there. 
Throughout our meal, our waiter (whose name we still did not know) did not check on us, did ask if everything was ok although to be fair he did acknowledge us once as he passed our table en route to another table ( by this point there were a few more customers). He simply asked if everything was ok as he passed by. Had he returned at any point after that, we would have told him about the bits of food encrusted on my daughters water glass and on the bottom rim of her plate. But throughout our meal we never got a chance to address our concerns with our waiter as for some reason he seemed to go out of his way to avoid us - and we still didn't know his name. About 10 minutes after the bus boy cleared away our plates we asked (the bus boy) to bring our check. Our waiter dropped it off a few minutes later on his way to another table, barely pausing to leave the check as he continued on his way. We asked the bus boy if we could speak to the owner or manager - oddly, owner or manager never came to our table either.
After a few minutes we paid our bill and started to leave. our waiter was stationed near the bar and asked if we had enjoyed our meal. I said we had concerns and wanted to talk to the manager. He said he was one of the managers. We told him our concerns then he told us the restaurant was one of the top rated restaurants in the city (his way I guess of demeaning our concerns). He said if we ever return to the restaurant let him know and he'll \"make it right\" and to ask for him. At that point we finally learned his name - Andreas. 
Tip to restaurant owners and managers - if a customer leaves upset, they aren't coming back. At that point you've lost your shot at another chance."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the very best home made, fresh pasta this side of Boston's North End.  Great atmosphere and wonderfully accommodating servers.  A true gem."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food and service.  I walked in the door and could not believe the interior of this restaurant considering the location and the exterior in the strip mall.   The ravioli appetizer just melted in your mouth. excellent wine list, although we were cocktailing it that night and they also made some out of this world martini's!  The atmosphere is just very comfortable and everyone was having a great time.  I will definately be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this restaurant. The lasagne is incredible. I've been 5 or 6 times and can't seem to order anything else on the menu. It's quiet, romantic and the perfect place to go if you want authentic Italian food. It's very reasonably priced and never too busy that you have a long wait, although it's a good idea to make a reservation."}
{"text":"When reviewing a business I generally like to give them some room for improvement.  I'm not sure how Tutti Santi can improve on perfection.  

Their wait staff is excellent.  Our waiter, I think his name is Brian, was perfect.  He checked on us just enough to be sure we were happy without constantly interrupting our conversation.  The other wait staff never allowed our water glasses to be less than half full and they did so without really being noticed.  

The salad was exactly as Brian (Sorry if I got your name wrong) described, greens and tomatoes with the house vinaigrette.  I knew exactly what to expect so wasn't disappointed by a boring salad.  Oh and the Garlic Bread was perfect.   I don't usually like garlic bread.  Theirs was crispy and chewy at the same time and not too garlicy.  I almost asked for more, but didn't want to fill up on bread.

I ordered the Lasagne and my guest ordered the seafood pasta special.  My lasagne was excellent, the noodles were very light, the cheese and sauce delicious.  I ate every bite and was sorely tempted to lick the plate.  I did manage to refrain but just barely.  Fortunately someone came and took the plate before I succumbed to the temptation.   

My guests seafood dish was quite pricey at around $35 but he said it was delicious and full of all kinds of different sea creatures.  He managed to eat all of the fishy stuff but couldn't finish his pasta.  He was also very happy with the wine he ordered, which Brian suggested.  

Even though I was about to lick my plate and he didn't finish his dinner we still ordered the Tiramisu to share and an espresso to finish our meal.  It was the perfect ending.  

The Tiramisu was light and delicious and the espresso was dark, slightly bitter and very strong.  I've had better, but my guest said that the espresso was very typical of what you would get in Europe.  

Love, Love, Love everything about this place, can't wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Went to Tutti i Santi with a group of friends.....the hostess was very nice and we got seated right away even without a reservation. The server was extremely attentive... we got water and the wine arrived at the table a few minutes after we ordered. The group started with the fried calamari with a side of marinara, which I didn't care for. I ordered the linguine with clams in white wine sauce, very tasty, although the pasta was a little overcooked. My wife had the eggplant parmigiana which was good, but not the best she has ever had. The desserts were Bindi desserts imported from Italy. We had the torta della nonna, a lemon cream pine nut tart, which was very good.  We finished the night with a shot of sambuca flambe'....nice touch.  Overall I like Tutti i Santi, it always feels like you are in an old restaurant in a \" piazza\"in Italy."}
{"text":"We just got back from a romantic celebration and the food was amazing. We had spinach and cheese ravioli and homemade gnocchi and we will be back to have it again. The wine was equally floral and a perfect pairing with the pasta. Our server was great!!! I can say, I will crave the ravioli for days to come. If you want a nice dinner with a romantic setting, you will not be disappointed. I would get a light appetizer for sure as you will be too full to enjoy your entree. And the patio is open for the nice weather!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Chicken Fiorentina and the Agnello is their lamb shank where the meat fell off the bone. Great time with friends and Sambuca after completed the night. If you ever been to Italy, this was home."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Great staff. Great food. Eggplant parm was lick your plate delicious. Excellent red sauce. Great atmosphere. I'm in PHX at least once a month. This will be a regular stop."}
{"text":"Have gone twice since my family found this place a month ago.  All staff members are attentive and kind.  Wait staff is entertaining.  The food is so good and worth the price.  Clam Linguini, shrimp pasta, and tortellini are so good.  I am not sure if their balsamic dressing is house made but makes the salad delicious!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This fine establishment gets 10/10. Our waiter's name was John and he was very friendly and seemed like he genuinely cared about what the customers ordered and how the food tasted, and was great on making sure everyone was 100% satisfied on what they wanted and how they wanted it. 
He also gave us a cheesecake slice on the house because our order took longer than expected because they were having a birthday in the other room/section of the restaurant. We definitely weren't expecting that! 
The food was some of the best that I've ever had at an Italian restaurant. I got the Pollo Della Casa and it was absolutely amazing! 
Definitely will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Probably the most spectacular meal I've had in a while...saut√©ed calamari, zuppo de pesce, lasagna, eggplant parm and house risotto were bursting with flavor, spice and literally everything nice!  Service was stellar and atmosphere was very old school Italian, highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place is where I usually go for family dinners their Italian food is great and they will occasionally have a performance by an Italian singer but what really had me hooked was their lemon sorbet it's amazing it is smooth and creamy and melts in your mouth its great. :D"}
{"text":"One word, Wow! Caught me by surprise. My wife has been bugging me to be more adventurous with some of our local restaurants and I'm glad I finally took her advice. This place is awesome all the way around. Atmosphere, food, prices and service. We both ordered chicken dishes and they were so dang flavorful. Made me want to share on yelp. Don't hesitate to visit this joint, it's good folks!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little italian restaurant hidden in a strip mall one mile from Westin. Delicious authentic italian food. Must try the calamari, ravioli and veal cannelloni."}
{"text":"The food was good, but seriously.....$21.95 for a 6 oz chicken dish. No kids menu. Three servers for a thirty person party and a half full dining room. The original tutti's was much better"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite restaurant!
To the gals who were offended by how they were allegedly cold-shouldered upon arrival in pool party attire, personally I wouldn't go to any sit down restaurant dressed like you described but hey, that's just me.
I have NEVER had any trouble whatsoever with service & this restaurant is one of precious few where I know I can order anything & not be disappointed.
Portion size is generous.
Employees are all friendly and personable.
Definitely suggest you try the ravioli a la Nina - they have appetizer & entr√©e. So amazing, they literally melt in your mouth.
Many healthy choices on the menu if you aren't \"splurging\" that evening. 
Cannot think of anything I didn't care for from the menu.
The seafood is always fresh and prepared beautifully.
Complimentary sambuco after the meal - delicious. Their desserts are positively decadent.
ONLY comment less than excellent is that sometimes the noise level gets a bit high, but...I can't blame a restaurant for diners having a great time and getting a little loud. To me, it shows that these guests are having a wonderful time, right???
Do not miss this little gem of a place!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to dine with friends from California that was not overly expensive but good food was easy. The reviews of this place were great and when we did arrive a couple at another table were cleaning their plates to the last drop. We asked them what they had and they raved about the ravioli and gnocchi.  So that's what we ordered and we were not disappointed! Service was exceptional and food was wonderful. Unfortunately, we did not have dessert since the portions were more than satisfying. Can't wait to try the one on Greenway closer to our home."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to Tutti Santi based on the recommendation of a waiter we met at a coffee shop earlier in the week.  Nice looking interior.... then it went rapidly downhill.  

A wobbly two top ( one of many) shoved up against a bar rail, which I assume they did to expand seating for Valentines Day... pretty tacky, but we were OK with it understanding they were trying to maximize the room for the holiday.

They claim online to have a gluten free menu, it wasn't available this evening, and NO SUBSTITUTIONS.  

We probably should have asked if they were going to offer the gluten free menu when we booked reservations,  so that is on us.

OK... I found the one thing on the menu that I could have, which basically ended up being a tin foil packet of boiled salmon, floating in white wine  with a couple of olives and 4 of the toughest shrimp I've ever encountered.  My wife felt her her ravioli dish was sub Olive Garden.

We saw our waiter once during the entire time we were eating, he came back when we were done to tell us that they had him covering too many tables.  He didn't ask how we enjoyed the meal, if we wanted more wine, if we were done with our plates... just a sigh and off he went.  My wife got his attention long enough to order another glass of wine, 15 minutes later I caught his attention and asked for our bill and cancelled the wine.  

We would have loved to enjoy another glass of wine and look at a dessert menu.... never offered.

A while later our waiter dropped the bill on the table, mumbled something, and disappeared again.  A lady who I assume must have been a host that evening saw the bill and credit card and cheerfully offered to run the check.

We dine out three or four times a week, and frankly I've never posted a negative review , but this was really just bad business."}
{"text":"I love the food here!! I have been here so many times and everything on the menu is delicious. If you are looking for authentic Italian food then you should definitely try this place. Besides the food being yummy, staff is super nice and make you feel so welcome.. Love it!"}
{"text":"We have dined here twice and been pleased both times. The homemade gnocch is delicious as were the ravioli. I can't recommend the escargot, however, they were't great. The waitstaff is friendly and efficient. You are able to dine inside or outdoors."}
{"text":"Every year when my family visits Scottsdale we make it a point to eat here at least once. 

There are so many things on the menu that I always want to try, but I cannot tear myself away from their Gnocchi. 

These Gnocchi are THE best! The softness and creaminess of these are incredible they literally melt in your mouth!! My grandmother is italian and makes her own and even she admits she cannot get them as soft and creamy as these. They come in a white cream sauce with a red sauce on top. I would prefer a little more red sauce compared to the white cream, but it is still a delicious mixture!

We always make a reservation for dinner. This is a small restaurant and it is always packed whether it be a weekday or weekend night. I would highly recommend a reservation to everyone. The menu is pricey, but you will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"2.20.12 dinner.  Excellent in nearly every way.  House chicken, margherita pizza, caprese salad, side salads, drinks, and spumoni and tiramisu.  All presented well and tasted great.  Cool grotto bathrooms.  Friendly efficient waiter. Nice flat tvs in the bar.  refilled drinks without asking.  easy parking.  Ask for the focaccia flatbread which is not on the menu - nice olive oil and fresh rosemary taste."}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars only because the appetizer (melon & proscuitto) was excellent and the entrees (ravioli and osso bucco) were quite good. The salad was limp, the soup was flavorless and the service was virtually non-existent -- seriously, 20 minutes from the time the appetizers were brought  and no server. Finally asked the bus boy to send him over. Noisy. Poor service; what's to like? Definitely not worth the price even if the service had been adequate."}
{"text":"I've never said that Italian food can be ok in Phoenix Arizona. And I've never said that I'm Italian:). 

I definitely think that Italian food is down here in Phoenix at this restaurant you gonna get the real deal with all Italian food & drinks. 

Pls don't think twice before you get an option to eat Italian food. Come right to this place and get the best you can. This the right place with the right ppl to serve you with Italian experience from A to Z."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in one night after a workout, perhaps a bit under dressed in our gym clothing, not knowing what to expect. Despite our extremely casual attire we were treated with the utmost respect and provided with amazing service! Our server walked us through the menu items and even made some personal suggestions to his favorite dishes. Leaving the choice to our server - we were surprised with two great meals that just melted in our mouth.

I was in love with this place: intimate setting, great service, amazing food &... and then it happened. As we ended our night the server asked if we would like to cap the night with a coffee (The wife and I are coffee snobs). What came out was a cup of silky smooth, full of bold flavor, just the right temperature coffee. This wasn't just good coffee. This was GREAT coffee. To this day - it is the best coffee we've ever had in Arizona."}
{"text":"If you are in Phoenix and want a great Italian meal this is it. We are staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak, this place is in walking distance of the hotel in a strip mall. What a fantastic meal and the service was as good!! We have a two year old and came in on valentines day. Not only were we welcomed in by a wonderful lady, I assume she is one of the owners but she took a liking to our daughter and made us feel so welcomed. Awesome...Awesome...Awesome"}
{"text":"Leo is the most absolutely incredible host! We dined there last night again for my godbrothers birthdays and as usual the food was fabulous. The wait staff was exceptional. I had the best seafood soup in AZ! We LOVE you Leo!"}
{"text":"Before going everyone told me to get the raviolis. When we got there the waitress encouraged me to get the raviolis. What did I get? The Orange Roughy. Was it good, yes. But... my husband who followed directions had ordered the raviolis and they were the best thing by far on the table. So, if you go, don't be like me. Order the raviolis!

Ambiance was very nice despite it's strip mall location. Service was great. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing place. The service was 4/5, the prices were 1/5 and the food was 2/5. This place charged me $30 for a pasta dish that had no seafood, or major cuts of meat. Just the pasta itself with red sauce and meat sauce. This is a normal portion size too. Not a family sized food portion. You maybe wondering \"you ordered the pasta, what were you expecting?\" Well, when you are at a Italian restaurant that claims to have really good food, and is worth the prices that's why I ordered it. I'm here to tell you it is not worth the price. The people that work there are nice and well dressed, but the food took awhile. The price of food there is not at all reasonable. The food itself was good, but not extraordinary. Tutti Santi is 2/5 all together in my opinion."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Service was spectacular and atmosphere was conducive for actually having a conversation."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in the valley, as far as I'm concerned. Totally unassuming from the outside since it's in a strip center on 64th St. & Greenway (in the same center as Fry's and McDonalds). But this family run restaurant that has been here for years. Same friendly staff every time...especially love being in the bar area. A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. Must try the ravioli (either as an appetizer or main dish) and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side. All entrees come with soup or salad."}
{"text":"What a delightful experience! I have been in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area for approximately 45 years and this ristorante is by far one of the best I have experienced not only in Arizona but West of the Mississippi. The food and service is outstanding. The Osso Bucco is a \"killer\" and the total experience is over the top! I look forward to returning to Tutti Santi in the very near future to experience their wonderful selection of dishes. I can't wait. I'm only sorry I hadn't found the restaurant sooner for it is a truly wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant In town, there is nothing like a family owned and run business serving authentic food from there hometown San Remo!!! I have had every dish on the menu which makes every visit to Tutti Santi a difficult choice on what to eat because they are all delicious.. To top it off they have an excellent and very personable wait staff serving you these delicious entrees and giving great service!!"}
{"text":"Goodbye Maggiano's
Thanks to Christina, our concierge at Kierland Villas who pointed us here. We spend a week in Scottsdale every spring, and usually get carry out from the great chain restaurant Maggiano's . Instead last night we dropped into this place and fell in love. Authentic, friendly, great wine list, and amazing melanzane involtini.
Trust me, this is where you want to go for really good Italian food."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Italian place!

We moved to Arizona 3 years ago and have been trying to find good restaurants for the different types of food we like. We've narrowed down our favorite Indian and breakfast place and now we've found our favorite Italian place!

We began the meal with an order of calamari fritte. It was very tender and not extra chewy like other places we've had it at. I wish it had a little bit more flavor but nonethless it was still good! I ordered the gnocci although I later wished I had gone with the lamb special. This being our first time there I figured I'd go with a favorite dish instead. So yummy! It came covered with tomato vodka sauce. Hubby ordered his constant, chicken parmesan. I'm not usually a big fan but it was also delish! 

We had our toddler daughter with and brought her a coloring book to help keep her entertained which we appreciated.  We ended up forgetting her sippy cup at the restaurant and I later received a call letting me know they would hold it for us. Most places probably I would have considered the loss a lost cause ;)

My only negative was the 15-20 minute wait even though we made reservations. That and it was loud and hard to have a conversation, but then again with a toddler how much conversation can you expect? It is a bit pricey, but we'll definitely be heading back, just maybe not as often as I'd like! (an appetizer, two meals, two beers, lemonade, and glass of wine + tip =$95)"}
{"text":"Whenever we are in Arizona, dinner at Tutti Santi in Scottsdale is a must.  The atmosphere is fun and lively with those quiet corners if so desired.  The staff is excellent - ask for Brooklyn Johnny or Giovani - they bring an excellent knowledge of food and wine, along with laughter to your meal. 

The food is outstanding - never a bad meal. Whether you have the special or something off the menu, you won't be disappointed.  Don't see something you like, no worries, they will take a menu item and customize it to your liking.  Just to name a few - Veal Caprese, veal canoloni, linguini and clams. It doesn't get much better. 

Follow up an outstanding dinner with a homemade cannoli and a shot of sambuca.  When you're at Tutti Santi you're family."}
{"text":"Wonderful place!! Amazing food and friendly service! Huge portions as well. I highly recommend the calamari!"}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent. Glad I found this place while working in the area."}
{"text":"The lasagna was fabulous !!!! My mom ordered the gnocchi but the white sauce was just ok. It would have been better if they had a pesto or more of a tomato based sauce."}
{"text":"Really really upset... the waiter was horrible! He spilled drinks and did not even apologize, just huffed and puffed cleaning it up. He ruined my new years eve meal... DO NOT ASSUME things mr. waiter. It happened one to many times that night to not post about it and to top it off I have called and left 2 messages for the owner or manager to call me back, nope nothing! I have given plenty of time so now here is my rant. It was a great meal (overpriced) but i would not go there again if they have that same offensive waiter! I will update later if I get a response or find out he is gone."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm not sure how we didn't end up here sooner, but I'm glad we finally tried it!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my most favorite places in town. The food is outstanding and the service is the BEST! You must try it. You will want to go back often I promise!"}
{"text":"If you happen to be in Scottsdale and want Italian this is the place. Excellent service and spectacular food, you will love it."}
{"text":"I personally feel that the \"experience\" at a restaurant has an influence on me as to my judgment on my meal.  At Tutti Santi, the staff truly made my wife and I feel that they were genuinely glad to have us there and they enjoyed taking care of us.  My wife ordered the gnocchi, not usually being a fan of gnocchi, they changed my opinion.  We had a wonderful experience.  Not only was the staff enjoyable, there were obviously several regulars, that was also a welcoming sight.  We even met another couple whom we have made a date to meet again at Tutti's in a couple of weeks.  A local neighborhood place with regulars is a good sign....

My only criticism is that the wait staff was a little too ambitious to remove plates.  They were not trying to rush us, but felt as if i barely finished my last bite before the plate was whisked away.  Personally, I believe servers should wait till all at the table are finished before removing plates unless requested by someone at the table.  Also desert menu too \"common\".  Nothing out of the ordinary, pretty much what you would expect as Italian \"staples\""}
{"text":"I know this place looks like a hole in the wall, being in a strip mall and all.  But honestly, stop in sometime, it is the best Italian food in the city.  It is very intimate inside, and you almost always need a reservation.  The food is fresh, homemade, you can tell they put love into every meal they make.  The service is excellent, a true Italian experience.  Its a special treat to go there, as it can be pricey, but you get what you pay for.  If you want really fresh, delicious, authentic Italian food, please go to Tutti Santi.  You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"As a geezer who never claims Omg. 

OMFG.

This places makes you wish you had Pavarotti's lungs and a full cello suite. 

Great food, great service. Order the Veal Francese or the Veal Marsala, with the inky Super Tuscan; Modus 2006 Ruffino.

The Tiramisu was superlative.

This is the ONLY place in Arizona I would put on par with my favorite comfort-preset phenomena: Flemings.

Do try it.

As for the 'strip-mall' woes below me; note that you're not on the pavement, yeah? Once you're in, you're in. 2 stars is bogus Scrapbooking-PMS whining. Get with the program, lass."}
{"text":"Okay, it's in a strip mall and doesn't look like beans from the outside.   But once you step inside the door you're amazed at the decor.   It's beautiful, very old-world, like out of an old ethnic Chicago neighborhood - you expect Lucca Brazzi to be hanging at the bar - lots of old photographs, great lighting, and best of all, great Sicilian food!

We had a table for 6 in the bar; 5 of us ordered pasta dishes  and one girl ordered the chicken caprese - everyone loved their food!   Our waiter could have 'jollier' and smile a little more, but he's heavily accented French and working in an Italian restaurant, so maybe he feels a little out of his element.    Whatever, it did not deter our dining experience.  

Having taken a multitude of cooking classes and some in Bologna, Italy, my only complaint is that the 'bolognese' sauce on my spaghetti was a 'meat sauce' (ragu) and not a true bolognese, which gets it's complex flavor from sauteed carrots, celery and onions, in addition to  2 or 3 reductions of tomatoes, broth, milk, etc.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not a bolognese sauce.   It did require some hot pepper flakes and lots of the wonderful reggiano parmesano cheese they leave at the table, a generous gesture."}
{"text":"The lovely people at the Marriott Courtyard told me to come here for decent Italian food. Their enthusiasm sold me and I went solo. The ravioli was recommended for which I ordered.... holy cow! I've never had ravioli like this before (and I'm an experienced diner). Delightful, delicate and absolutely authentic Italian! The Caesar salad to start was flavorful and fresh. The service was personable and just lovely. Fantastic wine and homemade tiramisu were sinful. A little gem in a mini mall. Thank you Krista and Melissa for recommending! It was wholeheartedly delicious and fun. Thank you for a fantastic dining experience!"}
{"text":"I ate here awhile ago and it was amazing.  I called in a takeout order, the lady had forgotten to enter the order, but they totally made it up to me with some free salad and dessert and the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is a home run every time!

Always a nice spot for a date or intimate dinner with close friends and family, Tutti Santi is our go-to for authentic Italian.  The service is top notch.   

Their gnocchi is, in my opinion, the best in the Valley.  Try it with their pink sauce (you need to request this as the menu lists a cream sauce with a splash of marinara).  

My husband loves the Ravioli alla Nina.  It's so good. Sometimes ravioli dishes are so darn heavy, but not here!  Nina's sauces 
achieve the fine balance of lightness and flavor and this dish is a prime example.

Finally, try the tiramisu.  Light, fluffy and packed with flavor, this dessert is a great way to end a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"We had a dinner reservation for a party of six on Friday 1/19 at 6:30.  To our surprise there was a camera crew from Channel 12 news in the bar area filming a segment for the news.  We were led to a table in a small room off of the bar area and seated at a very dark table next to the cart with all the glassware and linens, not a very desirable table.  The really nice table was reserved for the news crew who ended up filming their interview with Nina and her granddaughter right across from where we sat.  We had a female waitress who was not very attentive to us, to say the least.  We ordered a bottle of wine, a couple of cocktails and two appetizers. She disappeared for long periods of time.  When my husband ordered his second cocktail, she asked, \"do you want a fresh glass with ice or are you alright with this glass?\"  I was speechless.  Our entrees took over an hour to be served, meanwhile, we had no water, no bread plates.  We were definitely the forgotten table.  At the end of the meal,my husband had to flag her down for the check.  No complimentary after dinner Sambuca, no complimentary birthday cake for Grandma.  It was such a disappointing evening.  Seems everyone was starstruck that night in hopes of making the cut for the news segment.  We will not be back, which is a shame as this used to be one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had a wonderful time. Matthew was so fun!!! The food was excellent.  The Rigatoni Pipitone was absolutely delicious. Such a fun night.  Live music Friday nights!"}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly welcoming and fun staff. This food is incredible and the servers are so knowledgable! I've eaten here so many times! I know when I'm dining here ill always get the best authentic  Italian food In town. My family has eaten here for years we've celebrated birthdays and other special occasions! It's the place you take someone who you want to impress! It's fine dining at its best. We've taken business colleagues to out of town family and plan to continue to recommend it for years to come. Thanks for great experiences! Ralph and Courtney"}
{"text":"Visiting the area for Spring Training and wanted some good Italian food. We found absolutely delicious Italian food. This restaurant is a hidden gem in a small strip mall. Every meal was so tasty, great sauces, fresh salad, great staff (Jimmy is the best!), smooth wine, I could go on and on. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow...best ravioli ever...great calamari...mozzarella salad...red snapper special...ans penne w shrimp speciale... our Server was the bomb...attentive and entertaining...finished up w dessert and sambuca...nice touch!Top 5 Italian Restaurants experience...worth the trip...mangia!"}
{"text":"We've lived in Arizona for over 10 years, and Tutti Santi has the best Italian food.  Its a true dining experience.  The service was very good, and our Pasta was amazing!

From the outside, you wouldn't expect the place to be as nice as it is, since its located in a strip mall.  However once we entered it exceeded our expectations.

Were glad we found this place and look forward to coming back with friends and family."}
{"text":"First time here- fianc√© ordered the chef seafood special... Hands down best Italian dish I've tasted. Yes, he ordered it... And I ate it because it was that good. Sorry babe! It's a long drive for us but we're willing to put on some mileage to come back here again. Oh, our server was great! The whole atmosphere made it seem like we were in little Italy :)"}
{"text":"Honestly this is the best Italian food I've ever had. The only bummer is that it's ruined Italian food for anywhere else I go.  Pretty much anything you order is incredible. The ravioli and eggplant parmesan are my 2 favorites and my husband loves the lamb. Whenever we do go out for Italian, it's only to Tutti Santi."}
{"text":"We came to Phoenix for spring training and stayed at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak resort.  What a terrific surprise that such a Wonderful authentic Italian restaurant was so close.  Great atmosphere.  Attentive staff.  I had the veal Marsala with fettuccini Alfredo and my sons had the spaghetti with meatballs.  All of it was fantastic.  The house salad was terrific and so was the bread they serve.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We visited the 16th St. location.  I gave it 5 stars bacause I can't think of anything to improve.  Food and service were both excellent.  The signature ravoli almost melt in your mouth. Of our party of five, four had the ravoli.  They must have seen me looking at their plates.  They left me 1 1/2 ravoli to try.  Also try the antipasto appetizer plate. We will certainly go back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"This place. 

I was looking forward to eating here. The menu sounded really good. 

The food was disgusting and soaked in oil. You can see the oil floating on top of their canned tomato sauce. 

A lot of regulars were dining, which is fine. Not sure why. The servers seem to know all of them, running over to their tables and giving them hugs and kisses. The two male servers are too much. 

This place is a racist unprofessional joke. We left the restaurant peacefully, kept my mouth shut as to not create a scene and the waiter came chasing after us. Seriously Guido?! Back off! Unprofessional. 

Will not be back. Food is not good and doesn't make up for the horrid behavior of the staff."}
{"text":"The Alfredo was delicious. The veal was not. 
The service was also not delicious.  Too many unassigned waiters means no one is actually serving and patrons suffer. The hostess hustled like she was the one working on tips.  I ended up tipping her and not my waiters.  Cheerfully she sat us, watered us, herded our waiter(s) when they were busy ignoring us and then bussed our table.  
At $24 a plate there should be prompt intuitive service, no varmints, and really I shouldn't have to box my own left overs.  I was really looking forward to my first time here.  Unfortunately this first impression means it will be my last visit to Tutti Santi."}
{"text":"This is consistently one of the best real Italian restaurants in Scottsdale. We like sitting in the bar area & they always accommodate us. More importantly the food is amazing & they make the best cosmos. Although it's not inexpensive we always leave feeling we got our money's worth. The raviolis are so good, last time my mother in law got an order to go!
Hidden gem in a strip mall!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last night with a group of friends without super high expectations.  However, this family-run place gave us amazing service, the eggplant parmigiana was the best I've EVER tasted and the spaghetti bolognese was at least in the top 5.  Best of all, we had a great time with staff who really made us feel like guests in their home.  I'll be back.  As luck would have it I'm going out for Italian again tonight at another place.  I just hope last night hasn't ruined me for tonight's experience."}
{"text":"It is a moderate family style place. Small in size and big in heart. This is the newer location of a restaurant that has been around for a very long time. For some warm Italian comfort food in a friendly setting you simply cannot go wrong here. The decor is basic but the food is really really good. Neighborhood Gem, Special Occasion"}
{"text":"This was such a great meal out while on vacation. Fellow yelper's reviews guided us here.
Our server was very nice, but it wasn't till after we placed our order that we overheard other servers telling their tables about specials and options of salad or soup with their entree. We would have liked to know this information.
So, we started with their homemade ravioli appetizer, a plate of 4. They were so good! They have them as an entree too. Then we had our salads, also good and unexpected. Then our entrees came. I had the Veal Cannelloni and it was so rich and filling. My friend had the Capellini del Dottore. 
We were to stuffed to order dessert, but were treated to a shot of Sambuca.
I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some good Italian food heard this place was  Great 1st arrived pretty busy that seated right away got water within a minute but it took at least  10 minutes could have been a little longer but not too sure  For the server to come over  Asked  F we wanted anything to drink all we one who has water then he got a nasty attitude  I thought that's just the way he spoke by the table next to us was ordering alcohol so he was super friendly and joking around with  Them so I guess for us he thought that his ticket was gonna be lower so why bother So we're looked at started off with the calamary that was really tough and chewy I guess overcooked didn't care for the  Didn't care for the sauce either For my entree I order the   Egg plant parmesan It was decent With the red sauce had more flavor was little bland tried my son's gnocchi that was OK I prefer in pesto by he enjoyed it my wife got the best meal the lamb shank that was really good and a whole lot  Of it Deafening something I would order  If I ever went back but I  Doubt that"}
{"text":"After reading raving reviews we decided to take our 75 year old father here for his birthday. The bread and oil were delicious and the setting is wonderful, close seated tables, lots of people talking and a warm sense in the dining room. Unfortunately, our food wasn't as good as I had expected and honestly Olive Garden probably serves a better spaghetti with sauce. Overall we weren't impressed with our meals (9 of us each had something different from seafood to spaghetti).  Great place to enjoy an appetizer with a glass of wine (nice wine menu) as I said, I really love the setting."}
{"text":"OK. I have to start by saying that not everything was bad during this visit. However my first impression of the staff was disappointing. My husband and I walked in and literally stood there for at least 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. There were 2 waiters that passed us and looked at us but continued on their way. One waiter, an older silver haired man, acknowledged us finally to say to give them a few minutes. The young woman arrived after a few moment and sat us. She seemed very sweet and eager to please. I love Italian food and I understand the wait is part of the experience. However, the bread was late and it took a while for the water as well. 
But like I said not all the experience was bad, The entree was pretty good. The soup was not, it really tasted and looked like it came out of a can, sorry.
I mean, it you dont all the stuff I mentioned please come to this restaurant. The ALfredo and the ravioli was pretty delicious. As for me, this was our first and last venture to Tutti."}
{"text":"The Tortellini with beef was unreal great! The pasta was perfectly cooked and the light creamy red sauce was fantastic. The best Italian food I have had next to Sorrento Italy. The service was great"}
{"text":"Felt like a little Italy restaurant in NY or Baltimore. Great food and nicely presented. Been here 3 times with friends who are regulars there - they come from Chicago and are Italian. So when they go I go too!

The wait staff are attentive and the pace of serving the courses is just right. The veal shank is drop off the bone excellent, the  hef's special seafood was fresh and absolutely divine...I asked for a soup spoon so as not to leave any of the broth behind.

Fabulous. Thank you!"}
{"text":"WOW!  Our friend, who we took to another Italian food restaurant the night before and was horrible, showed us up!  

My wife and her friend got the \"Homemade Ravioli alla Nina\" ... WOW!  (nothing more needs to be said)

Veal Parmigiana with Spaghetti al Pomodoro (...I'm starting to drool thinking about it again!)  The Veal was sooooo tender almost didn't need a knife.  Their sauce was also EXCELLENT!  Spaghetti was cooked PERFECTLY! 

After our bad experience, this is our new Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Being a Jersey girl, finding decent food in Arizona ( besides Mexican ) is next to impossible.  Believe me, 3 stars is very good for this area, especially Italian.  Chicken Della Casa was good although a little too salty.  Deserts were awesome."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner.  Ravioli was wonderful.  Some of the best we've ever had.  Service was great even though Chase was swamped."}
{"text":"Went here through Deal Chicken...$59 for $144 worth of food with a bottle of wine, seemed like a great deal - unfortunately, it wasn't.  White the food and service were both good - portions were miniscule.  We both had mussels as an appetizer, and were given a 1/2 portion each, with about 8-10 mussels.  The main course was OK, but the side pasta was less than about a cup's worth.  Dessert was cheesecake - it was a half-portion cut into two slices- enough for 3 forkfuls.  So, what seemed like a great deal was a huge disappointment.  In these struggling times I can understand that restaurants need customers, but to say they are giving $144 worth of food when dividing portions in less than half left us feeling ripped off.  Perhaps if they would have disclosed beforehand that the portions were smaller than the regular menu this would have been a different type of review.  It has certainly given me pause to consider something like this in the future - before purchasing it might be a good idea to contact the restaurant and ask.....live and learn."}
{"text":"We've been eating here since it was Nina's on 54th St! We love the food, the friendly and very professional staff! It's a great place to come for a romantic dinner, or bring the kids for a special birthday celebration. The specials are to die for, as are all the items on the regular menu. We have one grandchild that only likes noodles and parmigiana cheese, no problem, and she said, \"It was the best noodles ever!\"

Try the Veal Franchisee, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Seriously?   $23.99 for linguine and clams?  

I really wanted to have a closer go-to for well done simple Italian since Baci moved to QC, but this was just awful.   The menu is not extensive; so you'd expect that what is on there to be reasonably priced, and very well done.    My husband and I were turned off by the bizarre scented candle / restroom smell in the dining room, so we ate on the patio... with the bugs.   The restaurant is very recent, so you'd think they'd have the lights outside all in working order.   They're not.    

The service was outstanding; Marcie was clearly a pro - but no level of service can make up for gamey canned clam bits on boxed linguine. 

We'll drive to Baci next time."}
{"text":"So, tonight was my first time here, and being Italian and from the North East, I was skeptical to try another AZ Italian restaurant, but I have to say this dinner brought me right back to Providence, RI. In my opinion, the best Italian Food in AZ! The service was second to none, and ambience was especially classic. I would recommend Tutti Santi to anyone for great Italian food."}
{"text":"This was our first time. Good experience, just won't sit by the entrance to the restroom area.
Very popular place for a reason.
I will return often"}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the presentation's quality and terrific flavours of all the items we ordered. The tiramisu was as good as we are accustomed to in Italy. You can't go wrong at this restaurant. All the details were perfect, from the romantic ambiance to the live music in Italian naturally."}
{"text":"The food is great.  I feel this place is overpriced.  I love my bread and it is average here."}
{"text":"What a great and fun place to visit on this area... I will definetely go back.  The food was amazing and the staff was very helpful and fun."}
{"text":"Here what we had:

1. Eggplant parmigiana with spaghetti.  Requested not to put cheese on MY PASTA.  The last time they did, it had too much cheese on it.  So today I said: no cheese on my pasta.  The result:  No cheese on my eggplant parmigiana either.  How do you leave out the cheese on eggplant PARMIGIANA?  I didn't say anything. I ate it.  The red sauce was good though.  

2.  Ordered chicken cutlet with an eggplant cutlet on top of it, WITH SAUCE  (spicy, please), NO CHEESE.  The result:  A weight-watchers portion of chicken, meaning, it would FIT IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND--AND IT DID.  90% of the plate was filled with penne pasta with sauce.  Hubby did say the chicken was super-delicious---what there was of it.  I never saw anything so small but he didn't complain to the waiter--I would have.  And the cost of this weight-watchers piece of chicken?? $21.50 American dollars --wow.  The last time we were here it was a regular portion and when we go to their Scottsdale location, the portion is quite large so we were shocked by the smallness of the chicken portion in relation to the cost.  
3  The complimentary garlic bread was tasty.
4.  The mushroom soup which comes with the meal was very delicious.   The salad was mostly  greens and one slice of tomato but was fresh.  
5. Were given Complimentary Sambuca at the end of the meal. but we would have preferred more chicken in the dish instead.
6.  I really prefer the on-line menu to match the restaurant menu.  This is a case when it did not.  So you come in ready to order what you want and it is not on the menu.  
7.  Nice piped in music with mostly italian classics.  Nice.  The waiters singing along with the music, not so nice.  
Trace was our server.  
A tad disappointed today."}
{"text":"In an everyday shopping center tucked behind the McDonald's and next to a Blimpies is the best little romantic Italian restaurant in Scottsdale. Just wonderful. Ravioli is to die for. Our server Gilda was fantastic. Live music on Friday nights. We prefer the bar area as we like to people watch. Very often Italian food can bother my stomach but I've noticed I always feel great after eating here -- they make everything fresh and use high quality ingredients. Reminds me of the great little Italian restaurants around NYC where I grew up."}
{"text":"We have been dying to try this place since we moved across the street. Since we work in the restaurant industry we thought a quiet evening at home with some to go food would be nice....Guess what they don't do to go orders between 530 and 830 on the weekends. We have been in the restaurant business for 20 years and that's the first time I have ever heard that. So we will gladly pass and WILL NOT GIVE OUR BUSINESS TO THAT. looks like we will try another local place instead."}
{"text":"The service here is on point.  The waiter that served us was really nice and friendly.  

No complaints on the food.  It was DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"Figured to give it a chance and was very dissapointed by the Lasagna, which was tasteless. Ravioli was decent, and the lobster bisque was good. Salad and bread left lots to be desired, how can you mess up bread? Next time I will stick with La Calabria, more authentic and much better tasting."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for my girlfriend's birthday, and they did not disappoint. Everything from the wine, the appetizers, the main courses, and the dessert were absolutely delicious. Service was excellent. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much because it sits in a strip mall, but it is one of only a handful of Italian restaurants I will dine at in the valley.  The ravioli melts in your mouth. Try it with marinara and Alfredo."}
{"text":"Sometimes you think you have found a restaurant that you will be patronizing for a long time based on one experience.  My prior experience here was a good one but that all changed with today's return visit.  
Here is the question I pose:  

If you order chicken parmigiana with no cheese and ask that a slice of eggplant be added on top of that chicken, should the management charge you for TWO ENTREES, one chicken parm and one eggplant parm?.....Meaning $19 for the chicken and $15 for the eggplant slice.  Does that make sense to anyone?  It didn't to us.  
I can certainly understand an upcharge since we are getting something extra on top of the chicken.  But TWO ENTREES?  That would mean that he had two salads, two sides of pasta along with the slice of eggplant---there was no salad and no extra side of pasta so basically you are charging $15 for a ONE SLICE OF EGGPLANT.   Really?  Is this how you treat repeat customers? Does someone in management think this is rational? 
When the server told us that she was told by the manager to charge for an extra entree, we asked to see the manager. 

We told the manager ( a young, balding man-don't know his name)  that we had had this same dish without being charged for two entrees and pulled up the YELP REVIEW on my phone to show him what I had written about this dish.  
He turns to me in the cockiest of ways and said: \"I DON'T READ THAT.\"  Meaning, he didn't care what was in my Yelp review ( the review described how we had had this same dish on a prior occasion without being charged for two entrees).  

Actually, we wouldn't have  minded paying an upcharge ---we don't want something for nothing.  But on the other hand, we don't want to pay for something we did not receive.  There were no two entrees, no two salads and no two sides of pasta.  
Finally, an older gentleman who may have been an owner, settled for a $5.00 upcharge.  So chicken parmigiana with one slice of eggplant was $24. Would have been $34 had we allowed them to charge of for two entrees.  
My dish was less controversial.  It was chicken cutlet with mushrooms and a brandy sauce with asparagus.  I ate half because I was hungry but left the other half because it was not worth the calories.  
Needless to say,  we were not in the mood for dessert.  

The service was spotty.  Asked for straws several times before we got them.  The salads took 25 minutes to arrive.  Shouldn't some be pre-done considering you have a full house on a Saturday night?  Asked for butter several times before it arrived to the table.  I ended up taking hubby's water because mine was never refilled.  
It was not a good night.  You'd think that when you pick what is supposed to be good restaurant and go out for a nice Saturday night  dinner that it would turn out well.  
Not all the time."}
{"text":"This is the spot for some of the best Italian food!
 Hands down, THE BEST RAVIOLI, with a  lovely marana and a touch of cream, it melts in your mouth, like nothing I have ever had before, it is one of their specialties, made fresh every day, it is A MUST...
 The veal marsala is FANTASTIC, tender and tasty, the marsala sauce is smooth and sweet. Linguini w/ Clams is just DELICIOUS, you can taste the freshness in the clams( Hard to find in Phoenix)
  They end each meal with a sambuca lit on fire, Nice Touch!!!
  They have a great wine list and a full bar.
 I love it, have been going for about 6 years, It is a little pricey, so the visits are not as frequent as I would like."}
{"text":"I moved from chicago and had been on a hunt for good italian food and was really happy to find this place! The grilled calamari appetizer was very fresh and for entree I  got a delicious spaghetti with salmon and cream sauce. The salmon was very fresh too . Even though it was a cream sauce dish, it didnt feel super heavy which was nice.The service was good and you can tell it is a family run restaurant. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Our server was very attentive and the other staff were very friendly as well. Our glasses were never empty. Bread was warm and chewy just like I like it. Great selection of foods. We were both quite satisfied with our dishes. My particular favorite was the gnocchi appetizer. I wanted to eat all of it! Would definitely come back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The food was alright, but the service at the bar was great.  The people who worked there were friendly as well as the patrons.  Small bar, but it seemed to be a place where some of the locals used as a place to hang out and catch up with one another."}
{"text":"Very nice, warm, cozy, inviting atmosphere!  The food was pretty good and the service was great!!  Overall, a very good restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. Service was great. The meal was exquisite. We had a great time. Nice atmosphere and a delicious meal. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went to dinner for New Years Eve and everything was wonderful.  We usually go to Tutti Santi in Glendale but it was closed for renovation.  We were really happy we got to experience such a magical restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood Italian spot. Waiter was from Milan. Great evening!"}
{"text":"Looking for some Italian food after the cardinals game and found this place on yelp. We were not disappointed at all. This place was beyond good. The service was more than I expected and the food was so delicious. The waiter was great and not to mention hilarious. We left there full and happy. Definitely a must have if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I was recommended by my co-worker couple of times to try this place.

So finally i tried it on 4/30/13,with my wife.  The service is impeccable and all the waiters were the best!  

The food never disappoints.  The ravioli is always a favorite.  If they are serving osso buco you have to get it!  And dont miss the complimentary shot at end.  

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I got to practice my schoolboy Italian with a very patient Romanian server. I had the lasagna Bolognese. My wife had the Polo Della casa, and my son had the pollo Caprese. All was buonissimo. All the saints would be proud."}
{"text":"Found this place tonight after searching on yelp for a local restaurant. When we walked in we were greeted warmly by the staff. Vincent was his name and he was quite the gentleman, quite the character, and quite the  waiter. Our food was fantastic. We tried everything from escargot to a couple of desserts. None of it disappointed. Given it's location in a strip mall, you would never expect to find a gem like this. It is one of the top rated Italian restaurants  in Phoenix and one taste you will see why. Make sure to try this place, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best Italian food I have ever ate in my life!!! Definitely one of the best restaurants in AZ. I had the saut√©ed calamari for an appetizer, and an amazing dish for dinner with red snapper and pasta. Their bread also melts in your mouth. Blown away by the service. Gilda was my server, and she was amazing. Everyone was super nice, professional, courteous, and sooooooo hospitable. I've never had service this good at a restaurant other than at Cafe Poca Cosa in Tucson. SERIOUSLY. AMAAAAAZING restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome dining experience! Fun waiter!! 

The ravioli is superb especially with Alfredo sauce!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is Molto bene! ! Absolutely delicious food and amazing service. All the pasta is house made and melts in your mouth. The sauces are are amazing and complement the pasta. The orange roughy is the most delicious dish I have ever eaten!  This is an authentic Italian at it's best!  The creme br√ªl√©e and tiramisu are a great ending to a delectable meal. If you don't try this restaurant, you will miss the best meal in the valley of the sun!!"}
{"text":"Our family just did a mini-staycation this past Saturday at the Westin Kieriland.  We did not want to eat at the hotel, so upon recommendation from the staff, we went to Tutti Santi.  We were only getting take out, but the reception we got was incredible.  Each staff member was so friendly.  They wanted us to stay and insisted that our son Vinny would be fine.  We still got takeout, but while waiting, Vinny was running around the dining room enjoying himself.  The restaurant and staff reminded us of back east (New England) italian joints.  We were instantly in love with the environment and service.

Now the food.  The ride back to the hotel, I kept telling myself, please let this food be good.  It was awesome.  I got the chicken parm.  It is so easy to screw up chicken parm, but it was great.  Wife got a meat tortellini dish which was so good that  she wants to recreate it.  Vinny got the gnocci.  He ate a whole bunch and really like them.  I sampled them too, and I totally agree.  What good italian taste my 16-month old son has.  

It is great to learn that they have a restaurant in Glendale.  It will be a no brainer to visit Tutti Santi when we want Italian food on the West side."}
{"text":"I would say everything was okay.  Nothing special.  The service was a little awkward. We would have different people showing up at the table asking if we had been served our salad or if we needed anything. That is nice but to have to answer it over and over to different people got old.
Past the time I thought we should have been served they came by to tell us that they were out of one of the dished we ordered. They asked us to let them know what else we would like.  We had to ask them for a menu to help decide. They guy brought us a menu and disappeared.  I flagged down the next available employee and told them what we wanted. 
The food was fine. My son got the red snapper as an alternative. It was very mediocre."}
{"text":"We loved Tutti Santi, and had an amazing night here. Like other reviewers, we were visited by the chef, who asked about any special occasions we were celebrating, and seemed genuinely interested in us and our experience there. Service was wonderful and timely, and the food was to die for! I got the clams and linguine (Linguine con Vongole) in a white wine sauce, and my husband got the Trio di Pasta. Their pasta is to die for! I can't remember what we had for dessert, but it was also mind-blowing. We will definitely be back. 5/5 for service and 5/5 for food!"}
{"text":"We have been a repeat client for several years UNTIL today.  We called to see if we could get in for dinner and the hostess said we could sit at the bar.  When we came in the bar was full and she said there wasn't a table available YET the couple that came in after us who admitted to us that they didn't have a reservation either were given a table while we were turned away.  We have now crossed this restaurant off our list because of our poor treatment and their lack of quality customer service.
Be careful...."}
{"text":"Last night in Scottsdale and had another great meal! Tutti Santi has a great ambiance. I was with a group of 7 and the waitress did a great job handling the table. I had the Pollo Parmigiana with a side of bolognese and it was excellent. Ended the evening with cannoli's and tiramisu which we wonderful."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly atmosphere and the food came pretty quickly--perfect with a toddler!"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much as the family pulled up to the strip mall, but the food blew me away.

The place was busy, but with reservation seated quickly.

Table had fried calamari to start and was good as was the free bread.

Ordered the gnocchi (my Italian go to) and it was delicious.  All 3 dining partners had a different entree and all agreed they were delicious.  

If you are in the area, definitely worth a trip to the strip mall for dinner."}
{"text":"Just wow. Every single time. It's impossible for my family to eat here and not order Nina's cheese ravioli. Melt in your mouth. Then an amazing, slmple garden salad that is delicious and light. Followed by the piece de resistance -- veal cannelloni. Best. In. Town. No question about it. Homey atmosphere too."}
{"text":"The family and I stopped in yesterday for a little Italian cuisine. The waitress was great and spot on with her service. The ambiance was very nice at the beginning of our visit as they just opened. Toward the end of our meal it got a little loud music-wise but great if you love Billy Joel. 

On to the food- The food was delicious except for a few setbacks. The Gnochi left a little bit to be desired, a little too thick for my liking. As for my entree, the Lasagna, while very delicious, it's the first Lasagna dish that I have ever seen that had about only two layers of noodle stuffed with cheese/meet. A little lackluster to say the least

Stuffed mushroom appetizer rocks!. As does the Mozzarella Enough said

Final points
1. Taste of some items were great but dragged down by others
2. Pricing - A bit overpriced based on the above"}
{"text":"I just moved to a neighborhood close to this restaurant about 5 months ago and didn't even notice this restaurant in the corner of a shopping center. It was actually Yelp that guided me to this restaurant. We went for New Year's Eve and had their Special NYE menu. 

Ambiance: romantic, dimly lit with balloons EVERYWHERE! The waitstaff and the customers were getting tangled in the balloons, but it was fun. If you wait in the lobby for a while, you will see tons of celebrity photos of those that have been here including Jennifer Lopez, the Diamondback Coach, Charles Barkley and more. 

Customer Service: was good, but we went during their shift change, so they almost forgot our eggplant appetizer and didn't ask my husband how he wanted his steak (rare, med, etc). We would have just skipped it and just eat the main course, but the new waiter asked about it and apologized and gave the appetizer to us free of charge and made sure my husband's steak was rare. His efforts helped and we are so glad he brought it out because it was so very good. 

Food: garlic bread was dry, minestrone was fabulous, dressing on salad was tasty too. The Eggplant with ricotta and spinach appetizer was to die for. Veal Scaloppine was tender and the Steak was juicy. 

We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Despite being located in a strip mall, the atmosphere inside is cozy and authentic. The food is wonderful--best ravioli I've eaten...and we just got back from Rome. The special was delicious, enjoyed the Italian wine options, service was excellent. Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Tutti Santi is a gem! We had a great dining experience (albeit with a long wait for a Sunday night, but we did not have reservations - our fault). The servers have a true understanding of customer service and took good care of us while we waited. We enjoyed the small lounge area with a cocktail until a table was ready. Our food was delicious. I had a salad? starter with a lovely balsamic?vinaigrette?e dressing followed by eggplant parmesan?. This is the good stuff! We will be back. And be sure to make reservations. There's? a reason this place is busy!"}
{"text":"For years, I've heard how good this place it. Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but I wasn't that impressed. The garlic bread was good, very buttery, so if you're dieting beware. My lasagna was just ok. The salas was very good and I compliment their use of leaf lettuce, not plain old iceberg. Service  was pretty good, but I wish they would have come refilled drinks more often or had larger glasses."}
{"text":"We found Tutti Santi on Yelp.  We are from out of town and were looking for a place to eat on the way to the Phoenix airport.

The place was lovely.  My daughter had the gnocchi in a light cream sauce.  She loved it.  My husband had the spaghetti in bolognese sauce.  He said it was wonderful.  Of course portions were too huge!  I had the pasta and vegetables.  I ate the entire portion.  I can't believe I ate the entire portion!

At the end of the meal, the friendly and oh so helpful waiter brought my husband and I a complementary shot of lit Sambuca with three coffee beans.  The beans were to symbolize past, present and future.  My daughter had the chocolate cake and I had the creme brule for dessert.  

We had a wonderful experience and the meal was great."}
{"text":"First time going to Tutti Santi and we were not disappointed. Everything we ordered was delish! The star of the show might have been the Involtini Di Melenzane - tiny eggplant stuffed with ricotta and spinach - it was so good we almost ordered another. I had the veal marsala and my wife had the veal francese. Both were very good and were nice  sized portions. A side of fettuccine alfredo came with my meal and it was top notch. Sauce was creamy and thick with a hint of nutmeg. My son had the Trio Di Pasta and raved about the gnocchi. My daughter-in-law asked if the chef could do the fettuccine with chicken and he obliged. It was also outstanding. Wine list is solid and the prices were not over the top. All in all a great dining experience. We will return to try other dishes that we didn't order but looked yummy."}
{"text":"Had a great meal and good wine last night with friends. I have to admit it was the best Sea Bass I have had since moving to the valley. Pretty good bottle of Italian Red was recommended and we really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"My favorite dish here is simple and unpretentious... Chicken Parmesan. The chicken is breaded and cooked to perfection. The noodles and marinara are my favorite. I rarely have pasta so when I do it has to be WORTH IT. The sauce tastes as if it has been simmered for days and is bursting with flavor. I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was not that great. The salad consisted of leaf lettuce, a slice of tomato, and one dressing selection. And whoever heard of an Italian restaurant that didn't offer minestrone soup?? They offered cream of broccoli ( not Italian ). We ordered the gnocchi and it was way too doughy.  The waiter was cocky and screwed up our order too...Overall we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been coming here with my family since it opened, years ago. The food is consistently good. All of their pasta dishes are excellent. If you like soups like the kind served in fine dining, they are known for their excellent soups of all kinds,  particularly their lentil vegetable, stratetella soup, and minestrone.  On rare occasions they have Osso Bucco roasted veal lamb shank. It is superb.  If you are unsure what to try first on the menu, be sure to order the Penne Bolognese."}
{"text":"I'm not sure that I've ever post a 5 star rating before. My wife and I decide to have out anniversary dinner at Tutti Santi.  The reviews were positive so we gave it a try. We were not disappointed. The meal started with warm garlic bread. The waiter built a rapport immediately. The drinks came promptly. Our food order was the house specialty of ravioli and a veal dish.  Both orders were exceptional. What topped off the experience was Trace, the waiter. He brought us sambuka the was lit on fire with three espresso beans in it. He directed us to drink the shot he while leaving one bean in the glass. He explained that one bean was for the present, one for the future and one for the past. You are to leave the past in the glass. The Rocket was successful but I was unable to leave the past behind me. We finished with tiramisu, coffee and espresso.  It was a great meal but went well beyond that with the service provided to make a special night epic."}
{"text":"Great Italian food!  Tutti Santi is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in AZ hands down.  They have a few locations but this one on 16th St. is my favorite.

Its in the corner of another strip mall.  Inside it is very quaint, lots of candles, dimly lit and inviting.  The service has always been superb and even the price is not bad.

It seems as almost everything they serve is homemade with the best ingredients.  They make the creamiest raviolis that absolutely melt in your mouth.  The ravioli sauce is light and very flavorful.  I also love the lasagna.  The meat, the sauce, the noodles, spice, and size are simply perfection.  All of the soups I have had have also been quite delicious.  The one item I would not recommend is the leg of lamb.  I was not impressed with the flavor, or the price and I would not order it again.  

If you are in the mood for great homemade Italian and remotely near any of the Tutti Santis locations definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"The best gnocchi, ravioli, salmon, calamari and stuffed mushrooms we have had here in AZ. Jimmy thank you for taking great care of my wife and I. You treated us like family. Tutti Santi chefs.... thank you for a wonderful meal, we will be back soon. 

Thank You 
Bob W"}
{"text":"food was amazing.  started with the ravioli and octopus. both were winners. table had the special soap bucolic and I had the ruffy. both were straight from italy. service with gilda was the highlight of the night though.  very professional and gave wonderful mouthwatering descriptions"}
{"text":"Was staying down the street at Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak for a conference and heard several people, including the concierge recommend this family owned restaurant for their great Italian food, including their fresh made pastas.

It was close to 9 p.m.when I arrived be myself to a quiet restaurant. I decided to eat at the bar since the dining room was nearly empty at this time. I was greeted by Robby, the extremely friendly bar tender, who welcomed me, shook my hand and asked for my name, which he addressed me by for the rest of the evening.

I found out through the course of dinner that Robby's family owned the restaurant (one of two in Phoenix).

His family is first generation Italian (although Robby sounds straight out of N.Y. but he says he's never even been), and recipes are family recipes with some ingredients his mom won't even reveal to him.

I ordered the special, shrimp parm, which included a house salad with homemade Italian dressing - delicious. The shrimp parm was a nice portion of large butterflied shrimp, lightly breaded and topped with melted parm, and a side of spaghetti with marinara. Cooked to perfection.

The food was delicious, but what l enjoyed the most was Robby's humor, and the way he made a lone diner feel comfortable and at home. I will be back the next time I'm in the area. Thanks Rob!"}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a place that made you nostalgic of home? That's what Tutti Santi does, takes you home, whether that is Italy or Serbia (in my case). The place reminds me of the good old days when my father and his friends sat around the table drinking good wine and singing songs of the motherland.  

I went to Tutti Santi on a Friday night. The food, the wine, and the music hit all the senses and transported me to a time where music, family and food were one. This harmony created a refreshing and nostalgic experience.  

The food hit all the comfort spots; wine was superb, and the service was much of what you would expect at a European eatery (if you have been to Europe, you know what I mean) not super friendly but friendly enough. 
 
Tutti Santi is a gem in Arizona, I can't wait to return again and be transported back home."}
{"text":"We heard a lot about this restaurant and was excited to try it. We took our visitor there for dinner. The food was alright...nothing unique that will make us come back. The food is more of a 3.5 stars but it gets a point deduction for poor service. When we were having appetizers, the main Italian waiters of ours was anxious to take our appetizers away when we weren't done. When we asked for a Coke, it never came so we had to ask again. The worse part was when we were eating the main course. The young assistance waiter constantly kept wanting to take our food away. My husband was 75% done eating and the young waiter came and took it away without asking if he was done. Then 5-10 mins later he came and wanted to take my food away which I had to tell him I am still eating. Then he came again 5-10 mins later asking if we wanted a to go box and then he came and took my food away. We were rushed to finish up and get out every 5-10 mins. The restaurant was only maybe 25% occupied at most so none of us understood why we were being rushed out. We were all disappointed with the restaurant and would not come back."}
{"text":"A+ service the most Real and authentic Italian restaurant . The best ravioli in the world . Vincent took good care of us!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is warm and welcoming, service is great, my ravioli was tasty though not warm enough."}
{"text":"Great time , great service and food! This place is great for big parties. It's not on high end but it's quite good food! I really enjoyed pasta sauce, pasta and dessert!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Italian food on the west coast! The gnocchi with the pink sauce is the best I've ever had!! The chicken francese is out of this world as well. Anytime I'm on this side of town I make sure to eat here! THE BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  Amazing food and great service.  Best Italian food I've EVER had, hands down.  Robbie behind the bar was great, and the Lamb Osso Bucco was to die for."}
{"text":"Great family run service, spectacular food.  Try the gnocchi, rigatoni or shrimp/pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Surprised by unexpected North Phoenix location.  Attentive but not bothersome service. Antipasto platter shared among 3 people plenty for all.  The Chianti was splendid! The entre arrived piping hot, very impressive.  The food was delicious.  Lovely intimate dining. Reccommend.
 Only down side was it became so dim, had a hard time reading menu.  A bit more uplighting, please."}
{"text":"The waiter tried to be friendly however he was quite annoying. 
The food was mediocre. 
We we not return."}
{"text":"Food was OK but the service was poor.from the moment we walked in, we were treated like we were interrupting a private staff party. Two waiters eyed us like we were on the red carpet and based on their snickering, we evidently didn't meet their standard.  We arrived at 5:45 and happy hour specials were advertised on the menu and when we asked about them the extremely rude waiter huffed, looked at his watch and said the happy hour specials were only good in the bar not in the restaurant, even though the restaurant menu indicated happy hour until 6 pm.  rather than asking if we wanted anything, he simply walked away and did not return to our table until it was after 6pm. we were going to order full price appetizers but opted not to because of how we were treated.  we would have left if we were not meeting a business collegue.  The waiter continued to be sarcastic throughout our meal and he was completely dismissive of me, deffering completely to the two men I was with. I had been to Tutti's on 16th Street many times and thought I could expect a similar positive experience at this location. Unfortunately, I will never go back and I am not sure I will even return to the 16th street location. Something should be done to help the wait staff understand how they influence the entire dining experience for their customers."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have 5 stars all around! One of the best Italian restaurants in the valley. We have tried an array of dishes and each one is spectacular. The cheese ravioli is so die for and the best I've ever had. The service is always great too and the servers are extremely educated on the food and wine choices."}
{"text":"I am 100% Italian and grew up in NY, so I feel rather picky when it comes to Italian food.  Tutti Santi is my favorite Italian restaurant in Arizona.  The owner Robby and his mother Nina are great people and go out of their way to make you feel at home at Tutti Santi's.  The food is incredible and rather inexpensive from my perspective.  The home made raviolis are made fresh each day and I often bring friends and family in just to try them.  Everyone agrees that the Ravioli's are the best they have ever had anywhere! The calamari, mussels, and escargot are also very good appetizers.  My favorite entr√©e is the tortellini panna rosa which is amazing.  If you are looking for authentic Italian food and not some olive garden frozen Italian, you have to try Tutti Santi's.   Their wine list is very good also and if you have room for desert try the cannoli's."}
{"text":"Just went back here and had another fabulous meal - everything was so delicious and clearly homemade with care. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 4.5 star rating, if possible.  

When we come to town from San Diego, we try new restaurants that are highly rated on Yelp.  This one deserves the high star rating.  We rarely go back to the same restaurant but ate there 2 out of the 3 nights we were in Scottsdale.

The first night we had their fresh burratta (from Sicily), sicilian olives, greek olives, large tomatoes, basil and wonderful olive oil that is from Tuscany and gets bottled under their label.  My partner had lamb shank (osso bucco style) over milanese risotto with rich veal sauce - yummy!  I had homemade squash ravioli with four cheese sauce.  We ended up having panna cotta with berries and they provided complimentary sambuca with three espresso beans.  The bread and olive oil were delicious also.  All in all, the food was excellent and so was the service.

The second night we sat at the bar and was served by Deborah (owner's daughter) and met her father, Leonardo.  Great family.  We decided we wanted to try everything so we had four appetizers.  Carpaccio with parmesean cheese, capers, tomatoes, olive oil; gnocci (Iighter than a cloud)  in a cream sauce with a spoon full of marinara; burrata (same as the first night but it was double the size the next day); and the best mussels I've ever had (spicy marinara sauce or you have your choice of white wine/garlic or tomato sauce).  The stuff was like crack and my boyfriend practically licked the bowl.   My boyfriend loves limoncello so Deborah made him a limonello martini and then provided complimentary limoncello after dinner.  The tiramisu - the lightest I have every had. 

The service is excellent and the food is awesome!  I would definitely go back.  

Some Yelpers didn't like the strip mall location.  Who cares as long as the restaurant is nice inside, which this one fits that description.  Owners are awesome and describe the food so vividly."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the bar back in september. The bartender started with a great manhattan then super recommendation on wine. Great starters and specialties from kitchen. Dont let the location scare you. This is a fantastic place."}
{"text":"I got eggplant parm with spaghetti it was cooked perfectly! My aunt got the gnocchi which she said was the best she's had in a while. Also the bread that comes with it was pre buttered and had chunks of chopped up garlic on it. Omg we were in love with it. (Not for people who aren't a big garlic fan because it was loaded with it). You got your choice of soup or salad with the entree. I got a salad which was nice it was pretty dressed with balsamic. Simple salad no veggies on it but still good. My aunt got the soup and said it tastes like one they have at Olive Garden but way way better. Amazing meal for a really good price!"}
{"text":"What a stellar experience!  We were there with a very large group Saturday night and they had the good sense to give us Trace who was a fabulous server, totally rolled with our nonsense and was just a hoot in general.  

My food was phenomenal - I had the ravioli with spinach and ricotta.  Let me tell you folks - this is the REAL DEAL.  I usually avoid Italian restaurants because box pasta is so easy to make at home... this is not box pasta.  It is homemade and the raviolis were light, delicate and practically melted in my mouth.  The garlic bread was uber-garlicky, buttery and sinful.  (I guarantee you this restaurant is free of vampires.)  

We had brought in a birthday cake and I happened to notice that the person who made cake brought in paper plates.  In a classy-as-fuck move, Trace had already brought out plates and forks and insisted that we use those instead.  

I rarely say this about Italian joints but I would really like to come here again.  Thank you Tutti Santi for such a wonderful experience and give our man Trace a raise - he deserves it after dealing with us.  :)"}
{"text":"Had to write them another quick review since my first review of Tutti's.  Tutti Santi has become my only Italian restaurant that I'll go to in Phoenix....folks it simply is the best in town.  I've become a regular here, and the entire restaurant treats you like family...its always a joy coming in here.  If I could rate them 10 stars, I would.  Everything I've tried on the menu is outstanding...their pasta's are some of the best I've ever tried.  I could go on and on about this place, but I'll just keep it simple.....GO HERE!  And sit at the bar with Deb....she will take wonderful care of you."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for our first Valentine's day, and WOW was I underwhelmed!  Do not come to this location!  I loved the Tutti Santi in Scottsdale and Mesa, but this one quite sucked.
The service was terrible and slow, most importantly.  The layout felt like a big grid of cramped tables right next to each other, with no shred of intimacy or privacy, and no decor to speak of.  For the price I expect a bit more, and was totally let down.  My steak special was good, but my girlfriend's lobster ravioli was dry and bland, and the drinks were watered down."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant because of the number of stars it had. Although we went in a bit skeptical of the service based on some of the reviews.  Unfortunately we would have given 4 1/2 stars based on the food, but our experience was tainted by the server.  Our first interaction with the server was him walking up saying \"sup?\".. Not what we expected from a nice Italian restaurant.  Then instead of telling us the kitchen was closing and left it at that, he told us if we didn't order quickly the \"Mexicans in the back would start throwing pots and pans\". The food was delicious though!! The server really spoiled the experience, but with a different server I believe we would have loved the place!"}
{"text":"Nice Italian place in north Scottsdale, small restaurant can get very busy. Fresh bread served as a starter, love that idea. Portions very nice for the price you pay, everything tastes fresh and is served moderately quickly. Each entree is served with a salad, able to upgrade to a Caesar salad for $5. That seems expensive but the Caesar is worth it- cold salad and creamy dressing, huge portion (for a side salad). The wait staff is nice and attentive. We sat at the bar which is a way to get in quickly but very awkward to eat a full meal at. The bar is next to the kitchen so it's very busy and the structure of the bar makes it so you have to lean into your plate, not ideal for a meal but seems nice for drinks. High recommend a glass of Moscato wine, $11/glass."}
{"text":"Always a decent option with friends when I can't cook for them at home.  New locations sprouting all over the valley like tumbleweeds."}
{"text":"This place is the best place around the Hilton Squaw Peak.  Had dinner at the bar, dang it seats 6 people, yes just 6, but Robbie was a great bartender. Just making the experience great. I can say this is the only place to go in the area. yes its in a strip mall but being walking distance from the hilton gives it a ++++++. First night here in the area and will go back a few times while im here."}
{"text":"When I'm in Phoenix, Tutti Sant's is one of my favorite places to go.  I just love the ambiance, the people and the food too!"}
{"text":"Great food, but hit-or-miss service (more miss than hit) coupled with the pathetic \"sorry we screwed up your Valentine's Day reservation\" phone call we received today (with no attempt to provide a solution until prompted, and even then their attempt was weak), we're done with this place.  Too bad, too; the food is fantastic and the location is perfect for us.  Good thing they're not the only good Italian restaurant in the area.  We'll be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Took my husband out for his birthday, to what I had hoped to be a fine dining experience. This was our first time to this restaurant. The atmosphere was disappointing.  White tablecloths do not make a fine dining experience. We made reservations, and upon arriving at our appointed time, noted how packed the restaurant was.  It truly looked like the patrons were crammed in like sardines. We were taken to our table, which was in the bar area - also overly crowded. As such, the noise level in the restaurant was quite loud.  But what ruined any chance of a fine dining experience was the television above the bar broadcasting a college football game. Really?  This is fine dining? 

Our waitress was clearly overwhelmed with all her tables, as any type of small talk was lacking.  So much so, she even failed to mention the specialties of the evening.  I get more hospitality from the local diner. Kudos to the busboy who was very congenial. To be honest, we were so uncomfortable, we didn't bother to order an appetizer, just so we could leave sooner.  

Although our main course dinner was very delicious, the salad that accompanied was only a plate of lettuce with a slice of tomato on the side. If I am spending over $100 for a dinner for two entrees, with wine and a shared dessert, i expect a bit more.  Fine dining experience, no...but good casual dining, yes."}
{"text":"Spectacular food!  We came on the recommendation of our hotel, and were overjoyed to find it a friendly, atmospheric place with attentive staff and excellent food.  In atmosphere, Tutti Santi reminds me of the classic New York Italian sit-down eateries: draped curtains, mirrored walls, walls of portraits, and a familial atmosphere.  Our server, Jimmy, was stellar; our vegan food, delicious (if you're looking to make a great decision, get the gnocchi); the wine, perfectly selected to enrich the food.  Overall, a five star experience."}
{"text":"My friends recommended  the restaurant.  It was not busy at 6.30. The place was empty by 7.00. The waiter seemed annoyed  that we did not order any drinks . The bread we got was toasted and had a little  garlic. Wished there was a little  butter. Soup or salad came with the meal the salad was drenched  with dressing . The potato  leak soup was very good . Portions  could have been larger . We had the gnocchi.  Which was very good,  a little  soft .  I ordered  a spicy shrimp  with angel hair pasta. It was  decent . Prices  averaged 15 to 24 per dish . We did like the tirimisu  which was very good ."}
{"text":"My wife and I met a friend and his wife for dinner here. He had recommended it based of someone from work. It was definately worth the drive out here. Usually I am not going to spend an hour on the road to get somewhere unless its worth my while (Like bobby flay as a guest chef or something) We settled on this place because it was rather equal distance for both myself and my friend from the east valley to meet up. We were all pleasantly surprised how good this place was. This has pretty much become our  meeting place now every few months to catch up, eat, drink and be merry..."}
{"text":"Wonderful late night meal with out of town guests. Great food & wine. Try the Ravioli alla Nina...yum!"}
{"text":"Real, Authentic Italian food in the desert, tutti Santi was the best Italian food I have had since moving to Arizona. The restaurant has an old Italian restaurant style feel which is Authentic and not cheesy. My waiter was great. An Italian guy with cool slicked back hair. Ordered a chicken dish with a bourbon sauce. On point!"}
{"text":"A friend told us of this restaurant, so we drove 40 minutes south to Scottsdale (worth every minute). This is authentic Italian, homemade pasta ravioli to die for! I had the pork chop, delightful! We have been back once and have scheduled to go again with 3 friends, who have never been. All within 10 days!! It is worth the drive no matter how far!!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite Italian restaurant in Scottsdale and Phoenix.  Met the owner at the Italian festival this year and glad we did.  Don't let the strip mall appearance fool you.  What they lack in curb appeal they make up in flavor! 

Any time we want great Italian, Tuttis will be our go to location."}
{"text":"Amazing Food, Excellent Service, and All Around Great Restaurant!!!! This is one of the Best Restaurants in AZ.. Must Try!!!"}
{"text":"Signs of a great restaurant have never included the words \"Fry's plaza and Great clips two doors down\". Tutti Santi is a fantastic place for outstanding service and homemade pasta. We had the lasagna and linguine and clams. Happy hour beers were 3 bucks which is likely to change in the winter, but no big whoop. This visit will be the first of many."}
{"text":"My wife and I use Yelp often and the four star reviews never let us down. We were excited to try this new Italian place which had four stars, but we left hungry and disappointed. The bread was nothing special. The water tasted terrible. Portion size was ridiculously small. Nothing about this restaurant supports its high prices. My wife wants to substitute veggies for pasta and they charged $5 dollars to accommodate the request. The veggies were saturated in oil and over cooked. Another thing that I wish I checked in the beginning of the meal was the bathroom. Had I checked before I would had left and not subjected ourselves to this poor experience. Dust and trash everywhere and the stench was awful. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. My wife and I dine out often and know our stuff. This place was a huge letdown."}
{"text":"Homemade gnocchi that practically melt in your mouth...YUM!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal and outstanding service from  Matteo, a true professional bartender with a fantastic selection of original drinks. Carpaccio, grilled squid and octopus, and veal francese were all soooo delicious!  Octopus was as tender as I've ever had!  We were trying out all the Italian restaurants in the area, but we don't need to go further. Can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Great food, great servers, great wine, great atmosphere. What more could you want?  Tucked back in a strip mall - a Phoenix secret. Great place for special occasions or an intimate date night."}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Ravioli are my personal favorite, cream sauce is amazing. My husband loves their chopino. Soups and salads are great too. Service can range from great to very annoying. But I go there for food so I don't mind it. Whenever I crave good Italian food this is my number one choice. 

Have to add that I went there with a 6 month old baby that would not let me eat. Nina, I believe the owner, came by our table and offered to hold/entertain the baby while my husband and I enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant via Yelp, and was very happy with it. Our party of four enjoyed each dish on the table (ravioli Nina, veal saltimbucco with fettuccini alfredo, veal francese with rotini in a fresh tomato sauce, spaghetti bolognese), along with an appetizer of the gnocci. Gnocci were delightfully lush when shared, but might have been overwhelming as an entree. (Yes, there IS too much of a good thing when it comes to rich calories). Conversation at the table slowed as we feasted--- always a sign of tasty dining. The meal was served with bread/olive oil/balsamic vinegar that was readily augmented by butter to match one diner's desires. House chardonnay and chianti were sipped appreciatively.

Service got high marks from us, as our server was personable and well-versed in the foods on the menu. A nice touch was that used silverware was replaced for each course -- a small thing that nonetheless added a bit more elegance to the evening.

Definitely recommend a visit here."}
{"text":"I don't know much about Italian food.  I assume that in Italy they eat more than red sauce and that it's probably on a par with French cuisine.  What did they eat before the tomato was introduced from the New World?  I have a picture of a barren plate of spaghetti and an expectant diner, kind of like that old Far Side cartoon showing what people did before TV was invented (they were staring at a blank wall).  I had what would probably be considered gringo chow to the seasoned Italian diner: a duo of a veal cutlet with a slice of eggplant covered in just enough marinara and mozzarella and a side of spaghetti with the same marinara.  There was just enough sauce and cheese to enjoy them without having the dish swimming in either.  Everything was well prepared.  My wife had the eggplant Parmesan.  I almost went for the lamb shank and risotto, but in the end decided to save that for the next visit.  For desert we split the tiramisu, which was just OK.  In the end, we were presented with shots of Sambuca con la mosca.  I normally don't like anise-flavored anything, but the coffee beans in the drink helped, and who's going to turn down free shots of anything?  The menu is not online yet, and it differs slightly from the other Valley locations but has most of what is available at the other locations.  We inquired after a kids' menu.  They don't have one, but will do half-plates of some of their pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Another amazing Yelp find!!!  This is our new go to Italian restaurant.  First, you must get John as your waiter - so fun and knowledgeable.  From the outside you might pass by this place which would be such a loss.  The ambience inside is so old school Italian.  Our table ordered the Vitello Marsala and the Vitello Francese, both prepared to perfection.  My side of pasta with alfredo is still dancing in my head.  Can't wait to return and explore the menu further."}
{"text":"OMG. I have not been to this restaurant ion over 3 years and it was always good but never really think about it much. Tonight I visited and it received 5 stars for a number of reasons. The first foremost is the food is outstanding! we sat at the bar like we do at most places and weer quickly greeted by the giddy bartender. I ordered wine husband a lemon drop martini. The bartender made the lemon drop and added a splash of Rasp liqueur in at the end to make it \"extra special. Quickly a hot basket of garlic bread arrived. Yay luv garlic bread. We ordered stuffed mushroom to start. Not my choice but hey they were good. It was so difficult deciding what to order due to their amazing menu. I finally decided on a shrimp fettuccine dish that was prepared with cognac, cream, wild mushrooms and shrimp. Orgasmic doesn't cover it. These were huge lump shrimp that tasted like lobster. By far one of the most memorable dishes I have eaten in years. Husband ordered Gnocchi. Wow amazing delicate covered in tomato cream sauce, made hrs before our arrival. The company of the staff mixed with the amazing authentic food bring me back to this place prob in the next week. I advise to to go this place for some amazing hands down top notch food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go here because the bartender at our resort had recommended it. We ordered two different glasses of red wine and our server brought back a bottle of just one of them so we decided to just share the bottle. We then ordered the ravioli and calamari for appetizers and both were really good. Bolognese was mediocre, I've had much better. Overall it was a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hilton around the corner and walked over to Tutti Santi's based on Yelp reviews.  Food was delicious and the staff was outstanding.  Everything from the salad to the Ravioli and spicy shrimp pasta special was great."}
{"text":"This place has recently opened up in my neighborhood so me and some friends decided to check this place out after a weekend of boating out at lake pleasant (fun time).  When you walk in the place is nicely decorated.  We were quickly greeted at the front door.  We sat down with a server named Jimmy.  I can honestly say that in all my years of eating out, Jimmy is the best server I've ever had.  I always hate how servers are too attentive nowadays and sometimes it comes off as annoying.  I want to eat in peace and I hate how when your mouth is full chewing they come over and ask you how your meal is!  But not with Jimmy, He was perfect.  Now for the food....where do I start?  The raviolis are homeade and they literally melt in your mouth.  The ghnocci ( i think i spelled that correctly) was amazing.  Then I had the Creme Brulee.  Delicious!  Overall this place gets 5 stars.  And the bathrooms were pretty cool also.  The walls are made of some sort of Rock.  Very cool."}
{"text":"Had another great dinner at the bar at Tutti Santi Scottsdale last night. Had the Lasagna alla Nina, which is one of my favorites, although I've never had anything on the menu that I didn't love. With that a couple of glasses of a nice Chianti Classico and an interesting conversation with Dan, who continues to be among the best bartenders in town. The place was virtually full, as usual, and the vibe was just right. One of my favorite hangs in all of Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is a small place but hands down has the best ravioli I have ever had. Prices are low and I would recommend ordering the ravioli as an appetizer.  They give you complimentary soup or salad as well. If you're looking for Italian, Id suggest you go here."}
{"text":"This was great Italian food.  Don't expect Spaghetti Factory.  This is not a family restaurant and I appreciate that.  Maybe the prices should suggest that as well.  Service was attentive.  And plenty of luster and charm that someone else couldn't find.  We used a Groupon on our first visit and were never insulted by anyone.  We returned with our Italian friends and they were happy as well.  We will be dining here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed there wonderful homemade ravioli and their Carpaccio Di Bue. We thoughouly enjoy their perfect food and service. We ordered it for pickup this time. I had to call to show my appreciation! Raw filet mignon may through you off, but the amazingly fresh capers, basil, parmesan and lettuce paired so we'll with it! I am in Heaven!"}
{"text":"For an elegant northern Italian dining experience, this restaurant is an absolute must. The moment you step out of the Arizona heat into the gently lit entryway, you know you are in for a treat.

Hardwood and dark, rich upholstery abounds while Frank Sinatra music serenades you from hidden speakers. A lovely lady who could be your Italian grandmother greets you warmly and ushers you to a comfortable seats around an expansive table. Instead of being in a busy Phoenix resort area, it completely feels like you are seated in an authentic San Remo, Italy ristorante. 

Our server was fast, polite, and made excellent recommendations for both wine and dishes. My companions and I started with the Mozzarella Caprese, which was refreshing after a long day in the AZ summer heat. We ordered a bottle of the Sangiovese/Merlot blend wine which is a must-taste for any red wine fan. I had the fresh halibut fillet dinner and each delicate forkful was cooked to perfection. The filet was topped with an herbed breadcrumb mix whose crunchier texture paired very well with the tender fillet. My perfectly al dente linguine was tossed with tomatoes, herbs, and olive oil and served as a hearty compliment to the light seafood. 

One of my companions had the Pollo Parmigiana and raved about how delicious it was. While I normally skip dessert, I opted for the chocolate mousse and am a little embarrassed to admit that I left not a creamy drop on the plate despite being full and satisfied from the shared appetizer and my entree. The mousse was the finest I have had in a long time with a rich dollop whipped cream on top and a crunchy dark chocolate cracker crust on the bottom.

Escape the blistering Arizona sun and step into a cool and elegantly appointed Northern Italian restaurant with excellent service, delectable dishes, delicious wines and satisfying, sweet desserts."}
{"text":"Great food great service great atmosphere. All the favorite Italian dishes i like and more."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall place with big personality.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  In a strip mall same as gallaghers sports bar but tucked away in the corner. 

We had Seabass special, grilled chicken special and the tortellini rosa.  The Seabass was phenomenal.  The service was fast, attentive, and old school Italian with good humor.  The owner came over to visit and she chatted a while too.  No need to order appetizers as the salad came quickly, fresh hot garlic bread too.  The meal portions are hearty. 

Pleasantly surprised.  Concierge at Hilton suggested and was dead on with this one."}
{"text":"New Year's Eve: crowded, lively, decent food. The live guitarist was a little tacky and annoying--sloppy and loud Brazilian and Spanish ballads (not especially Italian, or charming). The service was quick and friendly, though. Not bad for a fun family dinner."}
{"text":"My husband & I ate dinner here last night.  We both agreed it's the best Italian food we've found in AZ.  The ravioli is unbelievable, wonderful flavor along with the meat sauce bolognese which is amazing also!  We could not stop talking about how flavorful & good every course we had was!  We loved it & we'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! The location of this place is very deceiving. Do not judge a book by its cover. Our server was amazing and everything was delish from the apps to the entree and dessert. I NEVER save room for dessert but I made an exception this time and was not disappointed. You also get a complimentary shot at the end of dinner. Also the price point is very reasonable. I highly recommend trying this place out and I will be coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"I love this place it is small but the food and wine menu is so good!!
We go here pretty regularly so we have had many of the specials and normal menu items and have NEVER been disappointed. The ambiance is so nice even though it is in a grocery store mall.
Have the lobster ravioli it's to die for !
I have had meat dishes and fish as well and it is always superb!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for your review here. I took your advice and had a fantastic meal. Service was excellent and the food was wonderful."}
{"text":"This is not your 'typical' Italian restaurant in the Valley. This is the REAL deal! Every bite was a splendor of authenticity. In addition to the magnificent food, the family of Tutti Santi welcomes you as a family member."}
{"text":"Really great food. Service is impeccable. And the staff is so sweet. Not in a fake way either. Just do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"WHAT A GREAT EXPERIENCE WE HAD!!
I'm now in an electric scooter, and they made me feel like I was 100%+!

The water/waitress service is spectacular there, as is the pasta and sauces used.
Did I tell you the Waitress Service was great! We were insured individual items to our tastes, and she hit that for sure! GREAT food with a good red wine made our night for sure.
Then we finished with a Sambuca w/3 beans and an Espresso to cap.
What a night and thanks for all. Look forward to next trip to Scottsdale.
We wish he was in HB California"}
{"text":"Ok I seen 4 1/2 stars from over a 150 reviews! What are you people thinking? Food was good but damn not 4 1/2 stars I'll give it a 3 1/2 but I'll rate it 3 to bring the avg where it belongs! I ordered the grilled Octopus which was ok on a scale of 5 stars I'll give this app a 2 1/2, it was a lol undercooked, the soup de jour was a white bean veg soup that was offered with your main course ( or salad) for free was the star of the meal I'll give that 4 1/2 stars. I ordered Veal parm which was so tender that it fell apart, problem was it was so paper thin that I felt like I was eating fried bread crumbs without the Veal! I know veal is expensive  but come on! Really? Your remember that burger commercial for Wendy's, \"Where's the Beef?\" Well, \"WHERE'S THE VEAL!\" The waiter was great, I think it was John who says he from Brooklyn, but the way he say Calamari I'm not so sure. The side of spaghetti that came with my veal was pretty good the sauce Es a solid 41/2 stars I give the Veal 1 star because I didn't know where it was! The water did forget my mother inlaws Pasta side which he brought eventually when I asked for it. He was great but I think they were definitely understaffed tonight. I must say my espresso was as good as any I had in Italy I give that 5 stars and I thank the waiter for the free round of Sambucca for the 4 of us which I drank 3 of! I would definitely try this dining spot again, but 4 1/2 stars is a lil much! Way over rated on my 1st time here. And don't sit in the glass room you bake like a bug under magnifying glass. I had to ask to turn the  AC. When there where 2 tables occupied in this room it was ok but when all tables were filled get ready to breakout your swim trunks cause it was en fuego!! Again I'm from NY I know great Italian food, Don Pepe's in in Queens Il cortil in Lil Italy Manhatten , Rao's in Harlem too name a few those are 4 1/2 stars plus but this place no way a solid 3 1/2. Hey Arizona I'm from NY! I know Italian!!"}
{"text":"We had heard good things about Tuti Santi, so were expecting much more than we received here.  The service was excellent, but the food was very, very disappointing.  Bland food that is supremely over-priced for what is served.  Our salads were quite good, but none of our entrees were even vaguely interesting, not only taste but in presentation.  I am a huge supporter of local restaurants, but I have to admit this one is a no-go in its present form."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and a cute atmosphere. We will definitely come back!! Eggplant parmigiana was excellent and the spaghetti with meat sauce was perfection. Cannoli was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Tutti Santi on July 31, 2015, it was a memorable experience.  

First off, this place only serves dinner and if you're interested in a reservation do it online because you'll be lucky to get a return call if you leave a message.

When you arrive, don't expect flattering service.  I suspect Tutti Santi relies on it's regulars because the servers don't go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  They're not exactly rude either, but I saw other tables who were almost ignored until they got up and asked for service.

Speaking of what I saw at other tables... (YOU GOTTA READ THIS) I was watching the server who was working at neighboring table with a birthday cake and noticed something hanging from his face.  \"Huh\" I thought, \"I wonder what this is...\" So I watched closer.  I saw it again and suspected something gross.  On the third sighting I confirmed my worst suspicions, the server had a long watery snot hanging from his nose.  Yes, no joke!

As the server walked away from the table he wiped the snot away from his face with his bare hand, then wiped his hand on his apron. GROSS!  Seriously, I didn't know whether to laugh or vomit, so I laughed.

If you can tolerate the mediocre service, and the potential for snot in or near your food, then I encourage you to try the cioppino, it was great!  Served piping hot it came with plenty of mussels, oysters, shrimp, fish, and I think there may have been some lobster in there too, all in a delicious slightly spicy broth.  The tiramisu was good too, and our server (not the one with snot hanging from his nose) says it was made in house.

On the negative side, the salad was very plain and sloppily served.  Plus, they serve romaine lettuce which I don't care for.  

Thanks for the memories Tutti Santi!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this place on a Saturday evening at 5:30. We were seated immediately and our waiter was really responsive. We had no problems with our service or wait. The food was some of the best Italian we've had in a while, and the price isn't unreasonable. The restaurant ambiance is nice and feels authentic. I highly recommend giving this place a try. If you want to beat the crowds, just come early."}
{"text":"Wow!  Best ravioli I have had anywhere. 

Great experience, the food, the service, and the sometimes elusive thing, the ambience, was all wonderful. Our favorite Italian food in AZ."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and am now able to give this place an accurate review.  The first thing you should know is that this place gets packed during peak hours at all times of the year.  This isn't just a snow bird place and is more of a neighborhood joint.  So, make a reservation or be prepared to wait.  Also, the place is a bit cramped (cozy?) but there is not much that can be done about that.  The service is always excellent and the prices are a bit high.  All the entrees I've tried have been excellent.  It is best to stick with the Italian basics of which this place does the best in my opinion.  They try to be creative with some of their dishes (ex. caprese chicken) which they don't pull off as well as would be expected.  My favorites are he gnocchi and lasagna which are some of the best around.  Their homemade pasta dishes are also very good.

The only thing that pisses me off about this place is their bread which is plain and blah and that they charge you an extra $5 to upgrade their crappy side salad to a Caesar.

Anyway, it is nice to have a cozy, friendly, Italian spot with good food so close to home."}
{"text":"Our \"old broads\" group goes out once a month, and we like to patronize local places.  I was hesitant about this one because of some negative online comments, but all 6 of us loved our dishes and were impressed with the facility and the service.  No, it's not as inexpensive as the super-chain Italian restaurants, but this is a dining experience rather than a fast, cheap meal out.  We were fine with the reasonably-priced house wines, also."}
{"text":"I'm in love, seriously! We started the night with their calamari, tender and delish. The dinner salads were simple but tasty! The ghnocchi MELTS in your mouth and the spinach/ricotta ravioli is just out of this world! I highly recommend this place. We will be back (again). 

But seriously, order the ghnocchi! Hello mommy! 

Oh and if Emily is reading this, GTH."}
{"text":"I love this place. The best ravioli in the city. The gnocchi is also amazing. They are really kid friendly. They prepare a wonderful chicken breast and vegetables for my son with allergies. The decor could use some sprucing up."}
{"text":"Great special occasion place. The wood oven focaccia was so good we ordered 2 extra. Our entres were of decent portions and incredibly delicious. Service was just as incredible as the food itself. A little bit pricy, but as I said. A great special occasion place."}
{"text":"The woman who answered the phone was very rude. I called in and they refused to take my take out order. I've eaten here many times I won't be back although the food is good I will take my business else where to a restaurant that actually isn't too good for people that won't want to eat there."}
{"text":"Welcome to the set of any authentic Italian restaurant scene. From the staff, to the music (not Muzak), to the delicious food - if you want to take a trip down the Italian American culinary memory lane you absolutely will not be disappointed.
     I ordered the special, but I couldn't get past the red sauce without writing something down.  This is the basic building block of Italian cuisine and they hit it out of the park here. The perfectly prepared veal was something I had between bites of my \"side\" pasta.  All caps DEELISH.
     If you are anywhere near this spot deserves a trip."}
{"text":"First off, as a hungry college student, it takes a very special restaurant to give me a full and satisfied stomach.  Tutti Santi did the job.

The party I was in started off with a wonderfully simple Bruschetta, with Prosciutto.  Everything (the tomato, basil, mozzarella) was fresh and had a vibrant flavor.  Even the side salads they gave us were great, especially with their (according to them) homeade balsamic vinaigrette.  

Finally, my Lasagna Bolognese al Forno was amazing.  I've been to Italy and New York, and sampled some amazing Italian food.  This was the best lasagna I've ever had, easy.  In addition to the wonderful sauce, with plenty of meat and spices, as well as the overall heartiness of the dish, my satisfaction with the lasagna stemmed from the melty, perfectly cooked pasta, which I could tell was homemade.  I think homemade pasta should be the pride of any self-respecting Italian restaurant, and wow did this restaurant deliver.

Not to mention that we were in and out of there in under an hour and a half, and the service was speedy, attentive and pleasant.

I will DEFINITELY be back.  Thank you, Tutti Santi, for a wonderful meal and experience."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hilton up the street found this place on yelp. Was not disappointed at any course. We had the ravioli appetizer and demolished it in about 10 seconds. Yes it was that good. I had the veal marsala it was also amazing my wife had the eggplant parmesan and it was equally fantastic. The service was personable and fun at all levels. We will definitely be back when we are in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"ALMOST everything about this place was good. I went there for my birthday to have a nice dinner. We ordered the veal picatta and chicken rosa (forget the exact name). The food was good. Our waiter was great. Everything was good until the end of our meal when we asked to take our $50 bottle of wine home. The manager came to our table and told us it was against the law to let us take a bottle of wine off the premise. Since I had went through the DLLC course only 3 weeks prior, I knew he was wrong. I tried to explain to him that he was incorrect, but he insisted that since he had been in the business for over 10 years that he was right and I was wrong. To make a long ass story short, I didn't take my bottle of wine home. 

That evening I emailed the DLLC and asked them about the law concerning the situation at Tutti Santi, and they responded:

\"Was the bottle of wine purchased with a meal? If so the statute 4-244 (32) states:

It is unlawful for a licensee or employee to knowingly permit spirituous liquor to be removed from the licensed premises, except in the original unbroken package. This paragraph shall not apply to either of the following:

 A person who removes a bottle of wine which has been partially consumed in conjunction with a purchased meal from licensed premises if a cork is inserted flush with the top of the bottle or the bottle is otherwise securely closed.\"

SO, Mr. Matteo, this is to you: You WERE wrong! Your professionalism was admirable, but professionalism can only go so far when you are WRONG!

Moral of this review: Drink all of your wine."}
{"text":"The meal was excellent.  Our server was great.  I would defiantly return again, and we live in the far side of town."}
{"text":"I would say if you are looking for an Italian experience that will put
You in a starch coma you can't leave out Tuttis. Owned by Italians and everything on the menu is to die for. Save room for the dessert"}
{"text":"Dinner with Mom and her friend.  The service was totally inattentive.  Food was served, never asked if we wanted more bread, wine or anything else.  We ordered dessert and coffee.  Coffee was warm not hot and the dessert was a huge disappointment.  Mom and I ordered Spumoni.  We were served 2 mini scoops and the cost was $9 ea.  We did not see a dessert menu so I did not know the price.  I ordered Snapper with pasta which had 2 clams and 2 mussels and they were tiny.  Mom had Veal Francese which was good and very tender and her friend had eggplant parmigiana. (we are not big eaters) but did not have anything left over. 
There are many Italian restaurants nearby which are definitely better and certainly less expensive."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for a nice dinner. Whether it's taking your parents out or celebrating an anniversery, this is the place to go. The ambiance is nice the the food is amazing. It is a bit pricey but you definitely get what you paid for at the end of the day. 

I don't know how it is usually, but when we went, it was extremely crowded. Perhaps consider making reservations ahead of time if possible. 

Expect meal prices to be 15+."}
{"text":"Wonder food and very attentive waiter and staff. Good value for price. Will return here again"}
{"text":"First, I'm a tough reviewer.  A five or even four star review is not common.  

The restaurant is nothing to write home about from the outside.  Very dated entrance and setting.  It's a bit like stepping back 30 years to a local Italian eatery.

Service was very good.  All staff were efficient, friendly, courteous.  

Food was good.  Not exceptional, but solidly good.  

Wife started with the soup of the day, which was okay.  I had the house salad, which was okay.  Nothing special so far.  I liked the basket of bread, my wife thought it wasn't very good.

Had the muscles in a white wine sauce as an appetizer.  It was very tasty.  The sauce was exceptional.  But relatively small portion, and relatively high priced.

The calamari, as you would expect in a higher priced Italian restaurant, was very good.  Lightly breaded, perfectly cooked, it was tender and tasty.  Decent portion.  I would definitely order this again.

For dinner, my wife had some variation of veal scallopine.  My wife thought it was tasty, but the portions were very very small for a $24 entree.  Sauce was good... a common theme here.

I had their seafood pasta ($25).  It was a medium sized bowl of pasta, didn't taste fresh (boiled dried), with a good red sauce and a fair portion of good seafood.

My wife had the cheesecake for desert.  Very thin little piece, nothing fancy.

All in all, we felt that the food was good.  Service was excellent.  Setting was fair... a very dated but still nice setting.  

What we had a harder time with were the prices.  We just felt that everything was about 30% more expensive than it deserved to be.  They obviously don't spend much on the restaurant setting.  So I don't see how they can justify it.  If I had paid $16-17 for my bowl of pasta, then it would have been fair.  But not $25.  Not for the portions or the ingredient cost.

Perhaps that is why they were near dead empty on a Sunday night (not a busy restaurant night, I know, but still).

In other words... I enjoyed my food and time here, but not the check.  And so, as a whole, this place gets 3 out of 5 stars.   It's very likely I won't be back, but if someone else was treating me and wanted to take me there, I'm sure I would very much enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful all around. The service is good, the atmosphere is quiet and romantic, and the food is superb. A must stop on your Italian tour."}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian I've ever had! It was pleasantly surprise! The place doesn't look that great from the outside, but the food makes up for it. The martini's were expensive and not that great. Pasta is made right at the restaurant. Highly recommend getting some pasta! Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"6 of us ate there last week. The food was just ok, nothing special. The waiter was nice. But 2 out of 6 glasses were caked with food debris. So gross. Why wouldn't they look at the glasses while setting the table? It wasn't even a busy night."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had a great dinner at Tutti Santi - know there are mixed reviews.  We had the  starter ravioli, YUM!  A bottle of wine, Tuscan - I had the Pollo House - with asparagus, the sauce was delicious.  Hubby had the Veal - tender and yummy.  We would most definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best Italian restaurants, hands down! We go here for our birthday dinners and other good date nights. Such a treat!"}
{"text":"It was good.  Solid.  But I wasn't blown away.  Maybe it was my selection?  But for the price - there's some other places I'd go for the same amount of money.  Just sayin'.  Tables were way too close and I felt like I was on the 101 with staff and customers whirling around behind me .    Staff were nice and attentive.  Everyone liked their food - but not one of the five of us gushed in anyway about their entree.  My salad (and my dining companions Caesar) were LOADED with dressing.  Yikes!  Oh well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to the Hilton Squaw Peak Hotel at least 7 times over the last ten years.... This year we were going to visit a friend in Yuma however, we wanted to stay in Phoenix so we could dine at our favorite place to eat... Tutti Santi. We will say the food was excellent, but our server, Trace, was poor at best. He was charming and personable to other tables, sharing stories about his recent Birthday celebrations. When my Boyfriend said he wanted water to start with, Trace actually rolled his eyes. He made us feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable.  all of our expectations from previous experiences fell far short of  this last visit."}
{"text":"Have eaten here three times: The first for a large family gathering, the second for a dinner with friends, and tonight for a belated Valentines Day dinner. 

The first time we came it was amazing. The food was great, service was awesome, and it was a great atmosphere for the family gathering. 

The second time I went the food was good, but the server forgot an appetizer (not a huge deal) and it was a mess trying to get it taken off the ticket. 

Tonight was again absolutely amazing. We started with the calamari, which had tons of flavor and wasn't overcooked. My wife got the ravioli and I got the chicken della casa. The chicken was cooked well and the sauce was out of this world. The ravioli was as good as ravioli can get. Service tonight was the best service that I have experienced anywhere in Phoenix, reminded me of eating in NOLA.

Overall great food, if service is on it's amazing, and the atmosphere is really nice."}
{"text":"Most amazing ravioli and gnocchi we have ever had!!! So fresh and tender and the sauces are divine!"}
{"text":"Homemade fresh Pasta!!!! Great... outstanding food from the beginnings to the grand finale!!!!!!!!! One of our favorite Italian Restaurants in the valley"}
{"text":"OVERALL 4 STARS !
(The bathrooms themselves which are a combination of the Flintstones and Caesars Palace get 5 stars for originality)

The only reason this review isn't 5 stars is due to the hit and miss service, 2 times I've gone I was treated wonderfully then like a tattooed junkie, which is pretty bad I think even though I'm not sure what I fully mean by that.  But regardless of how I was treated the FOOD was SO AMAZING that I cant give a bad review.  I had the veal parmigiana (which some people are against and those people 1st off haven't tried veal and\or have watched animal planet so they wont eat it but will still will eat slaughtered meat) and I have never had veal this good in my life, the thinness, the flavor, the spaghetti on the side, the sauce was all perfect.  The salad that arrived before the entree was superb, just the right salad to dressing mix accompanied by high quality fresh ingredients.  Next time I'm dying to try one of the pizza's they make fresh they have a cool looking pizza oven, in fact the decor in this place is nuts and I realize i mentioned the bathrooms which are over the top but the place as the whole is really cool due to the design."}
{"text":"Tutti Santi is a a five banger for sure.   Tucked away in a nondescript mini-mall when I approached I was like is it even open?  Sure enough walked in and it was a busy family style Italian restaurant.  I sat in he bar and got Italian bread and fresh  parmesan  immediately, that's called a real good start.  The friendly bartender got a perfecto dirty martini poured in short order, not too dirty, super cold and generous size, and we were off.  The decor classic cheesy Italian, godfather pics, stars with autographs, Christopher Walken... the salad was delicious super fresh with a light but really flavorful balsamic and olive oil.  Not sure I've ever had that good a salad dressing!   Certain styles of food you just to have to try to get a measure of a place, for me it's linguini and clams.  Tutti Santi Nailed it of course, great flavor, healthy serving of clams, and when u get to the bottom, the absolutely heavenly olive oil butter sauce to soak up with the last bits of bread...wow!  This is food, a family run fresh local place that u would never know is there!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend and her skeptical Italian aunt. She ended up really enjoying her food, not bad for a new store. This place is more like American, Italian fusion. The waitress was really sweet but she had a few hiccups because she just started..... Kinda weird though, they were playing Mexican music haha."}
{"text":"I wonder why there are no reviews already for this newish location of Tutti Santi. This is the 2nd in Scottsdale, the first being on Greenway at 63 St.
THIS was the location of the former Ristorante Amarone, which I liked, although it was fairly expensive.

So I came in here by myself on a Tuesday night, when they were pretty busy.
I asked the hostess if I could eat at the bar, which I could see a few other people doing and she said of course.  So I sat & made myself comfortable and waited for one of the 2 bartenders to give me the menu. And then I waited some more. They were not very busy. FINALLY, I had to wave the bartender over to ask for a menu (he first gave me the wine list - there are VERY FEW wines by the glass here, & nothing that sounded interesting).  I guess there were no specials, and no soup of the day listed, but after asking specifically, he told me of a soup (couldn't quite understand what it was except it had chicken).  

I also was finally given some bread, which was standard supermarket tasteless Italian. No butter, so I used the olive oil at the counter, which was, I dunno, not quite right. Not rancid, exactly....not herbed, either.

I also ordered and received a Diet Coke which was pretty watery, with crushed ice.

Before I even went in, I'd had the urge for something like lasagna, baked manicotti, or ravioli, so I ordered the \"Homemade Ravioli alla Nina\" which I understand is one of their specialties.

Well, I was SORELY DISAPPOINTED by this dish, and I just cannot understand the rave reviews of it given by reviewers at their other locations.  Now, maybe I am too used to northeastern style Italian food (NYC/Boston) but also food in Chicago & San Francisco, and I'm used to not only the traditional, but also to many different restaurants serving \"nouvelle\" or innovative Italian dishes, including in Scottsdale.

So, here were my problems with this ravioli dish:

- the 'ultra thin' pasta shell tasted EXACTLY to me like the cellophane rice wrappers used for dim sum shrimp. Which is to say, not much taste really, but it works for dim sum. For ravioli? I dunno so much.
This pasta was also translucent & white, like cellophane rice wrappers. Only mushier. There were I think 6 ravioli's.
- the thin filling was finely chopped spinach & thin ricotta and not much of it. No seasoning that I could discern.
- the sauce was a nearly tasteless cream sauce.
- & each ravioli was topped by maaaybe a scant teaspoon of what seemed to be grainy unseasoned tomato stuff - almost like plain tomato paste?.  Not quite sure what to call it, but I sure wouldn't call it sauce. Yeah, like a dab of mild tomato paste.

The whole thing was just so tasteless that I had to SALT them to get any flavor whatsoever from the dish.  I've never in my life had to SALT Italian food!

The whole visual impression of the dish was FLAT. Like putting 6 Ritz crackers, each topped with a dab of cream cheese & a slice of pepperoni arranged on a large plate. Actually when they first brought it, I thought it was deviled eggs - all I saw was round white circles with a dab of red on each.

I managed to eat about half of this, then decided why should I waste my precious carbs? So I left the rest. 

On the side there was a small green salad, not bad greens, but the dressing was watery as if they hadn't quite drained the greens enough. I can't quite say what type of salad dressing it was, it had little flavor. There was also a tasteless mealy Roma tomato in it. I only bothered to eat about 1/4 of it.

I decided I better cut my losses - surely the desserts wouldn't be any good, so I didn't bother.

The service was okay after the initial being ignored.  But the food was so mediocre that I would probably never go back. I looked around & tried to figure out if the clientele were to any degree Italian (American) but they just looked generic Scottsdale/Midwestern to me, so I dunno. I am very
sure that my NYC & Boston Italian friends would be turning over in their graves, if they were dead.

*I* myself am not Italian, but I've eaten plenty of good Italian food in my life (some even in Scottsdale). But not here."}
{"text":"Can't believe we waited so long to try this place! Great ambiance, nice but not pretentious. Food was so good, exactly what we were looking for authentic homemade Italian without hype. 

Caprese was a great start. The pasta trio was soooo good. The ravioli was amazing, seriously one of the best I've ever had a I've been to Italy 3 times.

This will become our go to low key date night spot."}
{"text":"It's in a kind of nice area in Phoenix. The dish I got was gnocchi noodles with a white sauce. Kinda plain but my favorite noodles are the gnocchi noodles so I really didn't care. I went for my best friends birthday with her and her parents and a couple who is family friends of them. It's very cute on the inside. But the waiter we had was nice at certain times but mean and annoyed at others and he made it very obvious. I tried to be very understanding because I used to be a waitress and I didn't like it but still. He had explained the specials that night and my best friend asked later if that was one who thing or separate dishes and if it actually had noodles and instead he just repeated what it was and you could tell he was annoyed. And then I asked about the soup, knowing that he had already explained what the special soup was but I asked what it was because I thought there was more than that and then he huffed and puffed so instead of explaining myself to him I just ordered the salad because he was being rude. I also had the Italian cappuccino which I can't handle non flavored so it was a bit hard for me to drink all of it without having two packets of sugar. I shared with my best friend. For dessert I had the tiramisu which is my all time favorite dessert/cake. It was alright. I know every place makes it different but I would have to say I like it better at Olive Garden. Which is sad cause I don't even know if it's homemade there. There is a chance that it's frozen from there. But if you do go there the food is pretty good. Just be careful which server you get."}
{"text":"We ate  there last night- we are vegetarians and had the ravioli and the eggplant parm. Both were delicious! We had Tiramisu for dessert and it was great!  Our server was attentive but not intrusive.
We will go back!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST Italian restaurant in Phoenix. The homemade pasta is to die for! The ravioli de Nina, the veal canneloni, the lasagna. OmG!!!
Entrees come with a salad or soup. 

Ashley the hostess helped us out in a pinch. A.mazing! I screwed up and made a reservation at their other location on Valentine's Day by mistake and she still got us in within 20 minutes. Mateo, who works the bar is so personabke. Love this place! Thank you for an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"What a gem!  Great... I mean GREAT Italian cuisine.  Neat restaurant with a early 20th century feel. Tall ceilings. Dark paneling Southern Italian murals.    Four adults in our party had a variety of entrees.  All very good. Our Waiter was quick and attentive without being intrusive. One caveat to the experience.. he forgot to place our calamari appetizer    He did comp us a couple desserts.  Very good house Cabernet ... four glasses of that and two wonderful entrees....  $115 includes the 20% gratuity.
I little bit of a trek for us West Valley folks, but we'll go back."}
{"text":"Meet the family there for my nephew's B-Day dinner. I was impressed with the d√©cor and the friendly staff. The hostess was very cheerful as we awaited our family. The waiter assigned to us was helpful, professional, and funny. The table ordered the prosciutto and melon and an escargot for appetizers. I had not had a prosciutto and melon plate that good since I was in Viareggio, Italy.
      I always order the veal marsala  the first time I eat at an Italian restraint. They did it right! My wife's lasagna was very good also. The Crem Brule was spot on also.
     Nice experience and we will repeat. Thank You"}
{"text":"This has become our place when we are craving Italian. We've eaten here a handful of times and each time it has been amazing. 

Atmosphere- fantastic, very romantic and beautiful interior

Service- always excellent. We were even served by one of the owners last night and he was amazing, even accepting our restaurants.com certificate (they exclude fri and sat usually) 

Price- very affordable for the quality and portions

The food is always amazing. I've had the special a couple of different times and then ordered off the menu a few times. I always order a glass of wine and the portion is very generous, which i appreciate. We usually get an appetizer like the calamari fritti and then two entrees. The entrees usually come with a salad which is a nice simple salad that allows you to savor the fresh cracked pepper and house vinaigrette. We always take some of the entree home and are full and satisfied.  Unfortunately we have always been too full for dessert...one day perhaps. 

A definite go."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  What a hidden little treasure.  First the service was outstanding, we went there around 5:30 on a tues they were not busy at all.  We got seated right away, and the great service did not stop there.  There were constantly three people waiting on out table in some fashion.  Our waitress Laura was great, she knew the menu and made recommendations based on what we wanted.  Now to the food, my girlfriend had the ravioli and it had to be the best ravioli we ever had.  It was very light not to heavy at all.  As for my dish I had the gnocchi with the vodka sauce with was great.  Overall I give it five stars.  We are def going back again."}
{"text":"You can't fake diarrhea. 

These f*rs gave me VEAL parmigiana when I'd ordered CHICKEN. Until then, I'd never eaten veal and had no desire ever to do so. 

I was so upset and the best both the waiter and manager could do was apologize, say they'd take it off the bill (they better!!! I had two bites!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), then launch an explanation as to how, on a busy night, the kitchen could make a mistake. 

I don't care WHY it happened. That's the restaurant's business. I care THAT IT HAPPENED. Unconscionable.  

To top it off, I had total food poisoning that night and the following morning. Yes, I was completely nauseated that I'd consumed veal, but this wasn't psychosomatic. 

Like I said, you can't fake diarrhea."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place- this family owned restaurant is one of my favorites.



Just went again last night- their Ravioli ala Nina are divine, and my most common choice.  My daughter had their Rigatoni Pipitone, also.  You can't beat freshly made pasta, freshly grated cheeses, and  homemade sauces.  Salads are cold and crisp, soups fresh and flavorful. Desserts are sublime. 

I'm happy to have a glass of House Chianti, which is around $6.50, so you can enjoy a reasonably priced glass of wine as well. 

This is NOT corporate service, so don't expect a \"Capital Grill\" waitstaff skill level every time.  Definitely there are skilled wait staff, but there are also family members working there, and while I enjoy the old-school family restaurant experience, I know that not everyone appreciates the less than polished service.  They are always well-meaning, and that is part of the charm, for me.

They do not rush you out, they are pleased to help you select your food choices if you need.  If you have not been, I URGE you to give this non-corporate, completely enjoyable restaurant a try. 

My children have been here when young.  They are not \"dinosaur chicken nugget and fry\" kids.  The experience was fine for them, and they were treated well BUT they behaved appropriately, and were able to sit for an almost 2 hour dinner.  They ate what we ordered, including vegetables, calamari, stuffed mushrooms, eggplant... you get the idea.  I don't think they have bags of chik nuggets or PBJs in the back.  While they will gladly bring out a dish of buttered pasta or the like for a picky eater, be forewarned with regards to the potential length of your visit, and the no corporate kids menu.

On the dress code- we are in Phx/Scottsdale- an area where people are traditionally casual in dress.  While you may certainly wear jeans here for dinner, most of the dinner crowd was dressed up somewhat.  I would NOT recommend a grungy t-shirt or casual shorts.  If you have a nice top on, and decent jeans, you'll pass."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Tuuti Santi I was welcomed at 5:30 PM by a male/female duck couple, who post themselves daily for a fe months outside the door of the restaurant, eagerly awaiting their daily treat. They are clearly epicures, because the food is astounding. The lobster tail,  shrimp and mussels were cooked to perfection, presented over a bed of angel hair pasta cooked in a tasty tomato-based broth. Service was meticulous. We will return soon."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and engaging service. Ordered the amazing linguine with seafood fra diavola (spicy) style. Dish was loaded with fresh seafood (clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari) and pasta was al dente. I sopped it up with the delicious garlic bread that is complimentary. Carb overload but worth it! I also thoroughly enjoyed the authentic, NY style Cannoli. Incredible casing and filling like my days in growing up in New York. The food was a very solid 4.5 stars. What took my rating to 5 stars was the customer engagement and service. My server was Vincent. What an interesting, engaging, and warm human being. He sat down like a friend and we shared stories about New York, kids, movies, and food. He was like a friend who happen to be serving me a delicious meal. He also shared two shots of Sambucca with me to finish a great meal. He was  supported by excellent teammates like Andreas, another very genuine and wonderful guy. Just a phenomenal overall experience! Thumbs up and may you be lucky enough to enjoy the service of Vincent and Andreas during your meal! :-)"}
{"text":"One can find many an Italian restaurant in the city of Scottsdale.  Tutti Santi Ristorante Italiano by Nina's is tucked away in a strip mall off of Greenway and 64th street.  Very unassuming from the outside, Tutti Santi is a welcome respite from the heat that bears down in the summer months in Arizona. 

Their menu includes both cold and hot appetizers, many pasta dishes, and dishes with seafood or meat.  For a hot appetizer, their homemade gnocchi ($10.95, potato dumplings served with a bit of cream and topped with your choice of sauce) is a tasty appetizer to begin your meal. 

For a filling main course, Tutti Santi delivers a creamy Rigatoni Pipitone ($14.95) to satisfy one's pasta craving.  Their Rigatoni Pipitone consists of rigatoni pasta abundantly covered with creamy vodka tomato sauce and mixed in with ground sirloin.  Smooth and creamy, this is a decadent dish for any pasta lover.

At the end of the meal, you are given a complimentary shot of Sambuca liquor complete with three coffee beans (common serving style of Sambuca shot in Italy). Sambuca tends to have a black licorice taste.  This complimentary shot is good for any fan of the black licorice taste indeed.

Tutti Santi can be on the pricier end of Italian restaurants in Scottsdale.  One though, is given an ample serving for their price.   With a full selection of Italian specialties on their menu, one can find their favorite Italian dish easily at Tutti Santi."}
{"text":"One of the few 'Italian' places in town that gets the seal of approval from Italian friends.  The rich and decadent ravioli has been mentioned several times by previous yelpers.  Worth mentioning again.  The Bolognese is solid, especially the next day.   Prices a tad high for what you get and relative to other spots in town.  But relative to the dearth of similar options, a great addition to anyone's Italian shortlist."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. Vincent was awesome.  May be the best Italian we've ever had.  We had the gnocchi, sirloin lasagna, sea bass/calamari/shrimp special. 

Found on yelp and trusted the reviews. You should do the same.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on Friday night. Service was good everything came out quickly. Food was ok, not over the top. I've had better Italian in Scottsdale. Pleasant environment."}
{"text":"The ambiance was very calm, relaxing, no rush experience.  The food is priced very fair but the food itself was amazing.  We has escargot and stuffed mushrooms for starters.  For our entrees I had the orange roughy and my wife had the chicken fioritina.  Their ice tea is home brewed and one of the best I've had in a while.  We'll definitely be back.  Looking for an authentic Italian food restaurant ... You won't be disappointed!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I just had the BEST ravioli that I have ever had, and with an Italian mother-in law, I have had some incredible ravioli. I was traveling for work, and really hate eating alone at nice resturants, but a co-worker had taken me here for dinner on my last trip to Phoenix, so I knew that the food was awesome, so I decided to skip room service and headed to the restaurant alone. I was greeted warmly as I entered the cozy bar area. Andreas made me an awesome grey goose martini, which was perfectly chilled with ice slivers floating on the top. Robbie, the owner, was very welcoming, and I no longer felt uncomfortable eating a \"real dinner\" alone. 
I want to thank Andreas for the suggestion the ravioli, and I would like to thank him, Robbie, and the other staff members for making me feel like a family member. I look forward to my next business trip in October to see my new friends again. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves homemade pasta, fresh salads, and perfect martinis."}
{"text":"Excellent    Great food   Strong drinks   Excellent service   Homemade lasagne was tremendous     Definitely worth the drive !"}
{"text":"Very nice family operated Italian restaurant. Dinner room is dimly lit - great for a romantic dinner. Service was sub-par (waiter acted new), but the food more than made up for it. Appetizers were very good. Recommend the calamari. All the pasta dishes were delicious - portions were generous. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ate at Tutti Santi while in Phoenix for a business conference.  Met up with a co-workers father-in-law who happened to be in town and he suggested Tutti Santi, which he had visited on previous trips.  Had it not been for that recommendation, I don't know that I ever would have found this place.

They were quite busy that night due to a special promotion and it seemed that they were not quite used to it.  It took quite some time to place our order.  We ordered a bottle of wine for the table and I ordered a salad and gnocchi.  We started sipping the wine while waiting for our appetizers.  The salad was decent and the bread they brought for the table was actually very good.  However, due to the slow service, our wine bottle was empty long before the food came.

When the food arrived, we ordered another bottle of wine and began eating.  The gnocchi was very good, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their order as well. Unfortunately, our second bottle of wine never arrived.  When we mentioned it, the waiter apologized, but that was it.

This would have been an easy four star review but the sub-par service killed it for me. They may have been busy, but 15 minutes for drinks and 30 minutes for salads is still pushing it."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night, our last night of vacation. We were really excited to try out this place based on the rave reviews!  Wow!  We were wrong!!!

First we were seated in a booth which I requested when making the reservation. It took the waiter 12 minutes to greet us and ask for our drink requests. The restaurant wasn't even that busy for a Saturday night. Finally we ordered our appetizers and main entrees. Our appetizer consisted of the shrimp scampi. The absolute worst!  Over cooked, rubbery shrimp in a watered down butter sauce. My husband had the salmon with risotto and my son and I had the gnocchi. About 10 minutes after the waiter took out order he said oh yea, you want soup or salad?  Whatever....this is something that should have been asked when taking the order. The entrees finally arrived. My husbands salmon was obviously frozen and the risotto had zero flavor and was under cooked. The gnocchi was just as bad. Zero flavor in the sauce and quite frankly it was probably out of a jar. No way was it homemade. Honestly, canned ravioli would have been better. Don't waste your time or money on this place....horrendous service and even worse food!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is my wife's favorite Italian restaurant.  I enjoy it too, and plan on dinner here close to Her birthday or our anniversary.  

She usually get a Caprese salad and a fish dish, tonight it was the Salmon with risotto, she took 1/2 home for later.  

I had the Carpaccio and Veal Parmigiana, yeah I know it's not on the menu.  Ask.  MMMMMmmm veal.

We did have room for dessert, I had a Cannoli, She had Tartufo, and Espresso.  It took her two visits to figure-out that you get the complimentary Sambuca if you order dessert. 
Leisurely meal, good service, great food.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"We eat here almost once a month with my wife's family.  The service is impeccable, If you ever get Jill she is the best!  The food never disappoints.  The ravioli is always a favorite.  If they are serving osso buco you have to get it!  My favorite is the clams linguini in the white wine sauce.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been told for a long time that Tutti Santi was a must-try for authentic Italian food in a romantic setting, and I finally got to try it.

The Phoenix spot on 16th St. (there are five locations) is indeed romantic, since the restaurant is darkly lit with candles on linen-covered tables, with Italian decorative touches in its paintings covering the walls. The restaurant is divided into three parts-a main dining room, a smaller private area and a small bar area. If you mention you're having a romantic evening, and the place isn't too busy, they might even put you in the smaller room all by yourself, which is thoughtful.

The service is top-notch. Not only was our server friendly and engaging and made us feel like his main focus, but all the other servers who came to our table were friendly and professional.

We started with the Mozzarella Caprese ($11.95), which had thick hunks of mozzarella and sliced basil atop thickly covered tomatoes, smothered in diced tomatoes. I've never had a caprese dish where diced tomatoes were on top, but I love tomatoes, so I definitely didn't mind! It also came with some spicy peppers and olives, and all the factors complemented each other well.

For my entree, I ordered the Homemade Ravioli alla Nina ($15.95), with ricotta cheese and spinach. I was able to get a combo of the tomato sauce and cheese sauce, and you could really tell the pasta was homemade. It was so delicate and almost melted in your mouth, and the sauces were amazing. I felt like the dish was a little too watery and would have preferred the pasta to have been thicker, but I'd rather have thin homemade pasta over pre-made stuff any day.

My pal got the special, the orange roughy, which looked and smelled amazing. I really wanted to try it even though I don't eat fish, but the aromas were enough to make me know it was a tasty dish-which he agreed on.

We of course had to try the tiramisu, my favorite dessert ever. There was so much mascarpone cream in the giant piece of dessert, and it was served very traditionally, covered in cocoa powder. The ladyfingers were soaked heavily, and the cream was amazing. It was a really, really good piece of tiramisu.

Besides the scrumptious food, I loved that Tutti Santi had something for everyone, whether you want a romantic date night, an evening out with a big group or just want to chill at the bar and talk with the bartender. No matter what you go there for, it feels warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Top notch service, top notch food, it was my first time but definitely not my last, the ravioli and calamari are outstanding and the owners and staff make the experience truly unforgetable,  i felt like i walked into a local family owned restaurant in Italy . If you are looking for an amazing Italian restaurant tutti santi will not disappoint"}
{"text":"*drool*
I don't typically eat Italian but I was invited to go here. The owner is incredibly cordial and hospitable and the food was incredibly delicious. Best salmon and veggies ever!"}
{"text":"Tutti Santi superb food, ambiance, very attentive waiters!! They gave one in our party a free dessert as it was his birthday!! Just love that place!! Been there twice!! Never got anything less than a memorable experience!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant with great hometown feel. The ravioli is the best if you are a first timer here. I had the chicken imperial which was a little heavy on the sauce but it is still good."}
{"text":"This is our second time eating at tutti Santi but the first at this location. This visit exceeded the other one, so we'll be coming back to the 16th st location. Don't get me wrong the other location still has delicious food but I felt like the service in this one was more homie and attentive. Our server jimmy was great and we met Deborah & Roberto who were so welcoming. This night we had the mussels appetizer it white garlic sauce which is one of my favorites dishes here; the broth is just mouth watering! Lol we also had ravioli as an appetizers (thanks tutti santi for this gift) my boyfriend loved the ravioli so much, he order a full plate for his entree. I had the special of the night which was veal with crab meats and Marsela sauce; very tasty. We have only found two Italian restaurants in Phoenix where we enjoy the  food & service; Tutti santi is one of them"}
{"text":"I had heard such good things about this restaurant and was excited to try it for a birthday celebration! First the good: the wine was great :)

the not so good: I have a dairy free diet, so when i asked about butter in the dishes, our waiter said it was in everything! but could probably be removed but would not be so good. (Not really asking for an opinion here, but ok, thanks anyway)
So then, I ordered the pasta with marinara and added mushrooms (waiter said, why do you have the change the menu, you are such a woman. Ummm..ok, again, didn't ask for your opinion, but ok, thanks)

Pasta was fresh and pretty good, better with mushrooms, i suggested they change the menu being the \"woman\" that I am. 

The salad was mediocre at best, just lettuce and one tomato. would like to see more additions here. 

This restaurant serves FOUR veal dishes, I am strongly opposed to any restaurant killing and eating 6 week old baby cows, so I won't be returning here. They have NO vegan options other than the salad, rare for an italian place. I would highly suggest adding more vegan options and doing away with the veal options, it would open your restaurant up to all new clientele. I can't and won't support a restaurant that believes killing and eating babies is ok."}
{"text":"Great spot to take a date, the food is excellent. Try the chicken imperial and ravioli."}
{"text":"I went tonight alone for dinner.  I stayed next door at the Hilton and waled over.  I had a Salad with a good italian dressing.  They brought Garlic Bread.  I  had a Soda and water.  Each beverage was filled as needed.  My main course was Eggplant and Pasta. It was very good.  Owner came over and said hello.  They brought me a shot of Sambuca after dinner.  All for $18 dollars...a great value."}
{"text":"So, what do you do when you are an Italian New Yorker on a business trip in Phoenix and yearning for some comforts of home? Why, you head over to Tutti Santi of course!! After 4 days of Southwestern fare (and I'm a fan) on a recent trip out here in AZ, I was really hankering for some flavors of home, and Tutti Santi just happened to be across the street from the Hilton that I was staying at. This is old school Italian just like we get back home...Dean & Frank playing in the background, some tasty chianti ready to be served up, red sauce with plenty of zing, and all the old menu favorites. Fried Calamari was light yet crispy, with plenty of crushed red pepper in the marinara, the potato leek soup divine, and the chioppino special was absolutely loaded with clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, calamari, and orange roughy, served in a large skillet with linguini and a white wine & tomato broth that did not skimp on the herbs and garlic. Honestly, I was in heaven and had no room for dessert. All the waiters were as old school as it gets (again, making me feel right at home) and extremely friendly and attentive. The place was quite busy (it was a Friday night) but there was no lag time on getting my food. Seeing as I come out to AZ for business fairly regularly, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying.....ohhhhhemmmmmmgeeeeee!!! Ok. Got that off my chest. 

This was some of the best Italian food that has ever touched these lips. In fact, the entire experience was fantastic. My friend has been coming here for years and is well acquainted with the staff, so it was fun getting to know all the servers. We had like 4 different servers waiting on us, so clearly we got plenty of attention! But I guess that's what a table of 5 ladies will do to a place! 

Besides the wonderful service, the food was just delicious. We had calamari, good, and carpaccio, which was the best I've ever had, hands down. For entrees one girl got the homemade gnocchi. Holy savior! I cannot tell you how that melted in my mouth. The sauces were just indescribably delectable! Another girl got a seafood Alfredo thing, chocked full of mushrooms. The Alfredo wasn't just thick and intense like most. This was the perfect combination of cheesy, creamy goodness. The other 3 of us got cioppino. Oh my. No words could do this spicy, seafood pack dish justice.

We spent a pretty penny, but it was worth every cent!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoy this neighborhood spot. Good food and good friends make it special. A good Amarone and the ravioli makes for a most special evening."}
{"text":"Great food and old school Italian food!  Went for my hubby's birthday back in Oct, and will go back again when we vacation in Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here with a party of 7 for my birthday because I love Italian and we wanted to try something new. 
1) service was sub-par. Took several minutes to get someone to take our drink order. It was like our waiter couldn't see us. He walked past us no less than 6 times while we were trying to flag him down. We finally resorted to raising our hands like a bunch of kindergarteners. He still ignored us. If not for the hostess, all would have been lost.
An entirely different waiter took our food order than who'd taken our appetizer order. It took 20 minutes to get our salads. Another 30 to get our entrees. Now we're 1 hour 20 minutes into dinner service. 
2) food was delicious and we enjoyed it, despite the service... until a roach crawled across our table right in the middle of dinner. The Hostess saw the whole thing. Watched us hunt it down and kill it. She apologized and gave the excuse that it's Phoenix in the summer time. They crawl right under the door Sorry about that.
My thing is this--if you know it's a problem, why aren't you taking measures to fix it? A little weather stripping under the door, maybe? 
Anyway, no manager came and tried to make it right. No one but the hostess apologized (at this point). Our waiter was in the wind. The waiter who took our food order brought us our bill. Over $300. No compensations for the roach crawling across our table. Have a nice night.
The friend we were with (who actually suggested the place to my husband) had to go ask for the manager who took  $60 off the bill and gave our party a shot of Zambuka. By this point, too little too late. I'll never come back here, honestly, I'd rather eat at Olive Garden (that should tell you something). The ONLY reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the actual food was great. Everything else was terrible."}
{"text":"I had the lasagna... sampled the ravioli and enjoyed an appetizer. The sauce is one off, and phenomenal! Amazing flavor! Glad we came."}
{"text":"Everything about this place screams authentic Italian food. Went with my family, got this incredible pasta dish, literally everything I have tried so far from them has been spectacular! It is a little pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the valley.  It's locale, in a strip mall, is not elegant, but the food and service more than make up for its location.  It is not a cheap restaurant, but it is by far the best Italian food I've had in Phoenix.  Rivals some of the better Italian restaurants back in NYC."}
{"text":"Decent food that was just down the street from the hotel where I was staying. I got the ravioli entree and it came with garlic bread and salad. They could afford to spruce up the house salad a little bit, but the raviolis were tender and pretty good, even if the sauce left something to be desired.

Attentive service and plenty of seating indoors and outdoors."}
{"text":"Stopped by after a Pilates class in that strip mall and was so pleasantly surprised by this unassuming restaurant. Great service and they were happy to cater to our picky dietary requests. I had a sea bass special and replaced the linguine w perfectly steamed veggies. Delicious. A nice and reasonably priced italian Pinot noir and a complimentary after dinner drink. Oh, and did I mention the garlic bread? Perfection. My friends had a chicken and mushroom dish and a penne dish. Even the caprese salad was special enough to pack up the leftovers. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this restaurant. Always super friendly hostess/host. The owner is a super friendly. The food is amazing and the ambience of the restaurant is very nice. The servers and managers make you feel like you are at home. And when I order take out it is always delicious as well. Love it here!"}
{"text":"This wasn't the first time, but we went to Tutti Santi for a family Christmas Eve Dinner.  All I have to say is that everything was simply perfect.  Not only the food, but the service.  Which to me makes a restaurant with great food go from good to great.  

I ate the lamb shank- Angello Dorato, which fell off the bone and was delicious. I cleaned the plate. 

Dad had the veal marsala with fettuccine alfredo.  The veal was fantastic and the alfredo was just right. The sauce was not too thick-not to thin.  Dad cleaned the plate.  From him being in the food industry for 30+years and eating in many italian establishments both here and Chicago, believe me that says more than alot.   

Mom had the special of the night, which was a cioppino with tons of seafood.  When most italian restaurants serve this dish at least one of the seafood items will be rubbery or fishy tasting (not in a good way) especially the mussels.  Not here. Everything was the way it should be. I felt this was the plate of the evening out of 3 great dishes.   Mom didn't clean the plate, she has a small stomach.  But I will be eating the leftovers in about two hours after I sleep off my meal.

Everything from the bread, the calamari fritti, to the tiramisu was fabulous.  I'm glad we couldn't get reservations anywhere else for this special meal.
  
Gratzi and Buon Natale.

Oh yeah, I didn't get the raviolis this time, but if you've haven't had them it's a must try."}
{"text":"Came here based on the other reviews. We visit Phoenix at least once a year for a race event and decided to try somewhere new tonight. We were all amazingly impressed. Even in the parking lot we could smell the luscious garlic smell radiating from the building. We were seated right away and ordered a bottle of chianti that was to die for! Next came the garlic bread, must have been what we smelt from outside since it was covered in real garlic pieces. We each ordered something different and were each impressed by our food. My gnocchi melted in my mouth and may have been better than my last trip to Italy. My husband ordered the special which was a variety of seafood tossed with pasta sand served in the pan it was cooked in; every part was cooked perfectly, not a chewy piece to be found. Even the veal parmigiana was tender and portioned just right. 

To finish, we will return next week while we are here and hopefully every year we come back. Hopefully next week we get to meet the notorious \"mama\" who started this delightful eatery."}
{"text":"Yum Tutti Santi was awesome! For such a nice restaurant I did not expect it to be in a strip mall next to a Blimpies haha. Went here for a little date night and it was great. I liked the atmosphere, it felt fancy and the little bar area was cool. 
Our server was excellent. He was very informative and even had an Italian accent which we enjoyed! He helped us decide what to order and gave us recommendations. We both started off with a glass of red wine, we both liked it! Also the bread was very tasty, I ate 1.5 loaves..thank goodness I still had room for my entree. For my meal I ordered eggplant parmesan. For some reason it was listed under the chicken section by it's Italian name so I had trouble finding it on the menu and thought they didn't have it! Luckily I did find it, because it was so tasty. I love eggplant parmesan and this one was very good. A good cheese to eggplant ratio haha. The perfect amount of food too, not too much not too little! The spaghetti it was served with was delicious too. There was another vegetarian dish on the menu I really wanted to try but it was a bit pricey, so maybe next time. After we were finished our server brought us a little after dinner drink on the house that I cannot remember the name of, but it tasted like black licorice and had coffee beans in it. I usually do not like either of those flavors but I liked the drink, was a nice way to end a terrific filling meal. 
Overall great service, great atmosphere, and delicious food, I recommend!"}
{"text":"The only reason this restaurant is getting two stars, is because I liked the atmosphere. It's very obvious this place is in love with their patronage and focused on their regulars. 
My friend asked our server (Maria) to sample a glass of wine before purchasing, which isn't considered unusual etiquette in an Italian restaurant. The server proceeded to roll her eyes at the request, and send someone else with the sample. Appetizers came out immediately, but the salads took at least 20 minutes, and the food an additional 30. She barely asked us how we liked our food. We asked for separate checks, and the server brought us one check anyway- at which i proceeded to watch her stand with another server the bar, wasting more of our time, instead of just coming over and picking it up. 
I had high hopes for this place, but I'm embarrassed to have brought in our friend from out of town, insisting it would be great. You'd have to pay me to come back, which is a shame, because I live RIGHT down the road. Underwhelming at best."}
{"text":"I often crave the ravioli.  Little pillos of cheese in a tomato sauce splashed with a hint of cream.  Delicious.  The rest of the menu is standard Italian fare.  They restaurant is friendly and kind, desserts are good and the bread is always hot and garlickly.  (A plus in my book).  Give it a whirl, I always called it my \"compromise\" restaurant when I didn't want to spring for Marcellinos.  It's not as tasty, but not nearly as expensive either."}
{"text":"I've been several times and had a great meal every time. Quite formal, table cloths etc but good quality food in appropriate portions."}
{"text":"Quite good Italian food and a very nice atmosphere. Service was great as well with only a few minor miss-steps (our drink order didn't arrive and our waiter had to go find it). Complimentary after dinner shot of flaming Sambuca with 3 coffee beans was a fun touch."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with my husband, who had eaten here previously. The decor is old style Italian, and the food is amazing. I had the snapper and it was superb. It was served with linguini in a red sauce that had a slight kick. Pasta was perfectly prepared. My husband had the orange roughy which was in lemon caper sauce and was delicious, neither of us had eaten roughy before and we were pleasantly surprised. The desserts were traditional Italian desserts, so we decided to share a canoli, which was a great choice. The shell was crisp rather than soggy as some cannoli's can be. The filling had a hint of sambuca flavor. The only thing missing were the chocolate chips. Delicious meal and very attentive service, we would definitely go back. I would recommend calling for reservations as it is not too big a place and fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Five star food, 4 star service.

I came here for dinner the other day (they are only open for dinner), I really enjoyed my dinner here. Like other reviewers said, they have this old country club type ambiance. Reservation is highly recommended as they get busy.

Their wine list is extensive, I enjoyed a nice glass of Italian red with my meal. 

We started with a couple of appetizers. When a server explained to us that their burrata was home made, I had to try it. It is so soft, it melts in my mouth, together with tomato and olives, it makes as a perfect refreshing appetizer. 

Escargot was okay for me.  It wasn't bad but I had one better somewhere else. 

For my main dish, I really debated what to do. I ended up having tortellini, this one caught my attention first, although there were several more I wanted to try but I couldn't walk away from tortellini. They are home made... How could I resist homemade pasta? My intuition was correct. They were very good. Texture, flavor, portion, everything was perfect.

I tried their tiramisu for desert. Very large portion, good size to share.

So, 4 star service..., obviously it was my first time there and most other customers were in their retirement, and many seemed to be regular there. I just felt they received more attention and personalized service than my table.  Perhaps we looked really young in the crowds.  They were polite but they weren't attentive to our table."}
{"text":"Went here the other evening with my Sicilian guy pal.   He practiced his Italian on Debbie, the hostess, but she knew more than he.   Michael was our server.  Very accommodating but I felt a bit rushed.   We wanted a casual meal, but he wanted us to order.   We finally told him to come back in X minutes, and we'd be ready.

I ordered a glass of one of their cabs.   Very good choice, I must say.   He ordered his customary white.   Sorry.   I don't remember the vineyards of either one.   

He loves eggplant parmigiana, which he ordered.  I love and ordered fettuccine with shrimp.  YUMMMM!   Is all I have to say about my dish.  I think it is the bet I've had.   The flavors and the textures were perfect.  Definitely could not be beat.

One of my friends/clients, who is also Sicilian, works at their Scottsdale location.  She and Debbie are best friends.   One of my neighbors opened the restaurant (as a customer) almost 20 years ago, and has continued as a loyal follower ever since.   Roberto, the owner, was most friendly.   It is like a neighborhood watering hole in a more upscale sort of way.   

The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because of the server, although Michael did grow on me.   I know he was trying his best and has maybe a spastic sort of personality.   I know my guy pal didn't mind his personality.   So I guess I could give it 4.5 stars.

I would LOVE to go again."}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant.  Definitely family oriented and has that small place feel where they know everyone and want to know you as well.  Sat and ate at the bar as I was solo.  Food was well prepared and they followed up to make sure that everything met expectations. 
I'm pretty particulate about Italian food and this place hit the mark.  I ordered something i normally would  not based off of a recommendation and it was very good. Seems like  it is one of those small hidden gems that could do extremely well in the Scottsdale market but hits the mark extremely well where it is.  Surprised I have not heard of it before but will be back."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the food but with their  gift card policy.  BEWARE, not all Tutti Santi's are connected, they are independently owned and operated.  Therefore, the location where the gift card was originally purchased is the only location you can actually use it.  I received a gift card from my grandparents have been dying to go with my fiancee.  The 64th St location is a little out of the way so we decided to try out this new one.  We had a great meal (Oso Bucco and Veal Parm) but it was completely ruined when I went to pay and the waiter took one glance at my gift card and told me it was not valid.  He was very rude and not sympathetic at all.  He kept telling me it says on the gift card that it is only valid at the location of purchase.  After looking over the very simple looking card, it said nothing of the sort.  I complained to the manager as well and she said the same thing.  I was very disappointed in how they handled this situation and will never go to this location again.  I hope they have the same luck as Ristorante Amore and the many other failures that have inhabited that space.  Needless to say, if you want a real Tutti Santi experience, go to the 64th St location and you will not be disappointed.  The staff is way friendlier and the quaint location feels like you are eating in a small house in Italy."}
{"text":"This is a comfortable neighborhood Italian restaurant.  All the staples are here including pasta, veal and seafood. I had the veal marsala which came with a side of fettuccine alfredo.  

We also ordered a couple of bottles of reasonably priced sangiovese wine.

For dessert the tiramisu was large enough that the four of us could share.

The service was prompt and friendly.  Overall it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood Italian place that I forget to visit often enough.  This last visit I had the veal cannelloni which was heavy but very good.  The caprese salad was just OK.  The tomatoes and mozzarella didn't really impress me. My friend loved every bite of her spaghetti."}
{"text":"We were so Mexicaned out. We were staring at the Hilton close by and I'm a foodie so I won't eat at hotel restaurants. We took a chance here. OMG!! So amazing. Everything from the garlic bread to the veal to the dessert and sambuco was OUTSTANDING!!  Great atmosphere with the owner and the servers being so friendly and welcoming.  I was impressed with so many regulars eating here. That says a lot. We loved it. Can't wait to come back!!!  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"What in the World is such an upscale, nice, delightful, charming restaurant doing in a strip mall?

I probably should drop a star because of that location, but I didn't.

I had the vegetable soup & veal marsala.  Companion had pasta.  We cleaned our plates.  A galls of wine with the meal and dessert to top it off (I had ice cream & companion had creme brule).

And we got out the door for under a hundred bucks (including a 20% tip)!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Prices are a little on the higher end, but I think the food is well worth it! Our server was very courteous, informative, and patient in explaining the menu (they have homemade pasta and boxed pasta but the menu was a little vague in describing this). I ended up going with the ravioli which was phenomenal and others in my party ordered the veal cannelloni and Vitelli Marsala - both excellent dishes. Portions are also quite generous as we all had plenty left and took home. The ambience is sort of romantic but still casual and not too quiet. Looking forward to another visit here on my next trip in AZ!"}
{"text":"Oh gosh...

I don't know where to start...  This is on my top 5 restaurants on the face of this earth list.  My mouth is already watering...

Appetizers:  Their calamari just melts in your mouth wether you order it as is or grilled (which I like to request since it's healthier).  The Caprese salad is deeeeelish...I always like to ask for balsamic to go with it.  Finally, the Gnocci is also just delicious.

Entrees:  Ravioli Nina and the Veal Francese (substituted with chicken) is by far my two favorite dishes.  A very close second is their Cioppino....mmmmm.  The chicken francese is cooked to perfection with its lemon, butter, caper, mushroom sauce.  I like to add some of their marinara on top for some more flavor NOT that it needs it.

Dessert:  CREME BRULEE...OMG...it is sinful...the best I've ever had.  Their tiramisu is pretty darn good too.

Don't think twice about going here it is da bomb diggity!!!"}
{"text":"My main course of the tortellini was delicious, that being said, everything else was bad. I think it was because they did not seem to want our large party if 11, that on multiple times they let us know was an inconvenience (the restaurant was only 1/3 full), and when our napkins were mildew smellingand we politely asked for new ones, they treated us like we were rude, smelling the napkin and saying the entire bag came back from the laundry like this (hello, why would you out them on thetable then!) We also asked for new glasses because the store the napkins in the glasses. It was just horrible after that. The bread I was excited about was cold, wrong meals and drinks were brought with no apology. There was a good 30 minutes we saw noone, and we went through 4 different waiters. 
They over charged the gratuity and when we showed them the math they denied it only after asking for the manager they wrote in a new price. I will never go back. Even after all that we were standing out front at the benches saying our goodbyes when 2 different waiters came out and walked around the group. They seemed like they were trying to get us leave but I can't be positive."}
{"text":"Had a \"company\" meal here. The foot was decent but I would not say outstanding. The chicken dela casa OK, the asparagus was cooked about perfectly but the dinner salad was pretty boring. --just lettuce and tomato, nothing else. The dressing was pretty bland too. I don't think I would return on purpose. The only really positive things I can say are 1. I did not have to pay because I was on company business and 2. It was better than Olive Garden"}
{"text":"Best italian food in AMERICA !!!!! If you want to eat good Italian food there is only one place to go TUTTI SANTI !!!! Great service and beautiful restaurant!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Italian food there is only one place to go TUTTI SANTI. Beautiful restaurant and great family environment!!! Must try their beef carpaccio!!!! We will definitely go back with friends and family!!!! Kenats"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great Italian restaurant, you don't have to look anymore. Lasagna bolognese, pollo cabrese and parpadelle were just perfect. We finished our diner with cr√®me br√ªl√©e and tiramisu just amazing. Don't wait to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was decent, however the service was crap. Our server Maria did not take the time to check up on us. We basically had to ask the food runner for everything. I tipped the food runner for being so attentive, something our server did not care to do. I will not be visiting this place again because of their lack of customer service."}

{"text":"Food was amazing! The service was very friendly, i felt like family there. Pasta was very fresh, i wish more restaurants were as good as this one :)"}
{"text":"We cannot believe that this restaurant is rated so highly on YELP & Opentable.
We arrived for a 7:30 reservation and had to wait 20 minutes for a table - hostess was very scattered. When we were seated we received water...and then proceeded to wait for another 20 minutes before we received any service. Finally, a very unkempt & sweating waiter came to the table asking if we wanted drinks - my partner had a glass of red wine (good) & I ordered a Lemon Drop martini. The wine & martini arrived & my Lemon Drop martini was blue because there was blue curacao in it. The 'hits' just kept piling up...we ordered the beef carpaccio appetizer, my partner lasagna (something they're known for) & I ordered veal parm.  Only to have the waiter return & tell us that our carpaccio wasn't available because the 'machine that makes it is broken.' So we skipped the apppetizer. The complimentary salad was slapped down on our table & consisted of dressiing, lots of lettuce leaves & a singular thin tomato. It was ok. 
Our entrees arrived...my partners 'lasagna' was basically 2 tubes of ricotta cheese with a huge amount of red sauce...no meat nor mozzarella chese & a very slight portion. My veal was ok although it tasted more like a ground patty than a piece of veal. 
Thiis restaurant is by far not a 'keeper.'"}
{"text":"As a European this is the closest meal I have ever had in Arizona that is authentic Italian . The Polpo Spagnolo (charred octopus) was like butter but expensive at $17 for one tentacle. And the Costata Milanese  was the most tender piece of pork and served with tomato and capers.  The chocolate mousse cake was so moist and the semifreddo was delicious.
Gilda looked after us so well and all the waiting staff are attentive to your requirements. I highly recommend this restaurant. It's been around for years and it is obvious to me why. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Really awesome pastas.  Amazing sauces on them.  I really enjoyed my dinner.  The soup needed a little salt."}
{"text":"I'm proud to say that I will be their 200th review! To say this restaurant is authentic is an understatement. The waiter sounded very Italian, from his accent to his pronunciation of the word Bruschetta. I was very much under the average age, most were 65+ years old, which is fine by me. If you want to find authentic Italian food, follow the old people. Like a shephard, the senior citizen crowd guided me to the oasis where I could partake in the sweet nectar that is Tutti Santi.

The ambience, oh the ambience. It was as if I was exploring Venice in a gondola, captained by an Italian man with a voice the angels... all of the angels. 

The chef, who I presume is the only 5 star michelin chef in the world, hand crafted our bruschetta with thinly sliced prosciutto cut to perfection. The lasagna was decadent. The cheese, sauce, noodles, and meat created an orgy of flavor, leaving me satisfied. 

They do not aspire to cook authentic Italian food, Italy aspires to be Tutti Santi."}
{"text":"The entire experience was exceptional.  I travel a lot for work and try new places and gamble on a great experience. Let me tell you, this place was a winner.  The host was awesome from when I walked in, the service was awesome.  Not to mention the food, it was perfect.  I tried a variety of appetizers, the lasagna OMG delicious! And ravioli is to die for.... Dessert was great and had a surprise from our server, a flaming shot a some Dort of liquor with coffee beans inside.  A truly great experience, this is my first review but every time I get to Phoenix this is my first choice for dinner always.  Love this place"}
{"text":"Food ranges from delicious (elegant and lovely beef carpaccio) to mediocre (bland chicken rollatini and what might as well have been frozen vegetables).  The servers are lovely and attentive, and sort of distract you from the distinctly geriatric feel in the place.  My husband and I felt like the youngest people in the restaurant by at least 40 years.  I have no idea where this best ravioli nomination came from - they are abysmally forgettable.  I am hard-pressed to believe that a better ravioli cannot be found in Phoenix - there are just way too many good culinary adventures in the area to consider these bland, oversauced pillows of flavorless ricotta worth ordering.  

Unimpressed by everything, we were bowled over by the bill.  How could a meal so forgettable come out to $150 for the two of us?  Was the wine that expensive? No.  Did we order anything extraordinary? No. Are we going back? You already know the answer..."}
{"text":"We were shopping at Kierlands and were hungry so we decided to try the Italian place we saw in the shopping center near there.  What a treat!!!  Tutti Santi by Nina on Greenway in Scottsdale is awesome!  A great find.  It's in a shopping center, so you wouldn't expect an authentic Italian experience.  But we did! Really great food and \"locals\" kind of atmosphere. My husband loved the Veal Marsala and I loved the Pollo Caprese, it was awesome. The owner Leonardo was there. Really great guy! We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at the other location in Scottsdale just a few nights ago. We were not very hungry and shared that gnocchi and ravioli and it was amazing.

Since we both love Italian food we came back for more at the location in Phoenix.   I loved the homemade gnocchi so much I had to order it again. It is made with a cream sauce and has a touch of red sauce on top. For being a slightly more filling type of pasta the cream sauce is perfect. It's light and flavorful without being to heavy. The red sauce is very delicious too. 

I personally am not a seafood fan; however, my friend ordered the seafood linguine and she loved it. She said that there was an amazing amount of seafood in it. She was able to fill up on essentially just the seafood and only had a small portion of the linguine. She did also loved the flavor of the pasta.

Prior to the meal you receive a basket of bread that has been warmed with olive oil and fresh minced garlic. Yum!

Upon reading other peoples reviews of the house salad...we knew to anticipate lettuce and tomato with a balsamic dressing. Although it is a very basic salad the flavors are still amazing. The tomato has a balsamic vinaigrette dressing with small bits of basil. I chopped up part of my tomato and placed on the garlic bread and made a small bruschetta :) also added some of the Parmesan to the salad! I'm not a big fan of salad in general and it was very enjoyable to me. 

We ended our meal with dessert. Although we both like Tiramisu...we love cr√®me br√ªl√©e even more. There cr√®me br√ªl√©e was very good with a perfectly toasted top and a smooth and creamy custard. It had it diced strawberries on top too.

Another thing that made this restaurant  amazing, was our server. He was kind, friendly, attentive, energetic, and fun. He definitely made our dining experience better. The great thing about this restaurant is you can order what you want and the food will be good.

We finished the night here with a flaming Sambuca shot.  This was really fun and on the house!! Did I mention that our server was AMAZING!!! 

If I lived in this area I would eat at this restaurant all the time. it puts chain Italian restaurants to shame!  If I'm ever back in this area I will have to return here. I hope you try it out and have a great experience like we did!"}
{"text":"My family dined at Tutti Santi during our family vacation. I had the Rigatoni Pipitone which was phenomenal. I could tell it was made fresh with quality ingredients. Everyone else enjoyed their meal too. Very delicious and satisfying."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurant in the valley, hands down , the building is kinda old but your not here for that , I ordered calamari and seafood ciopino it's flavorful not like Olive Garden , calamari is not rubbery it soft and fresh we'll definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Best homemade ravioli and gnocchi!!! Absolutely phenomenal!  You won't be disappointed.  This is our 2nd visit in less than a week."}
{"text":"Me and my husband were looking for a good authentic Italian place last night for dinner that had homemade spaghetti. We had never been here before and decided to give it a try. Our server (jillida) who was amazing btw, recommended the ravioli to start out with which was absolutely incredible. I ended up getting it for dinner as well in a split plate that also had gnocchi with a spicy marinara. My husband got a rigatoni dish with sirloin. Both totally exceeded our expectations!! You could tell our server was very passionate about the Italian cuisine and was so knowledgeable about the menu. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. The service and food were top notch. The spinach ravioli, recommended by our server, absolutely to die for."}
{"text":"Thank you! 

To say we were surprised is an understatement. We brought along some family to enjoy it with us. The veal, fuggetabout it. Ravioli... eaten until there was barely a red stain on the white plate. 

The service: awesome. 

It's a relaxed place where they wait until you've eaten your appetizer until you order your entree. Tr√©s European. 

It was spectacular. We became heroes when the deserts came out. And even more awesome when the coffee with the Sambuca arrived. 

When you are looking for an authentic, tasty, delightful experiential dinner, go here. 


Thanks again, Guys. We had an excellent time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, I'm there at least every couple weeks. There is a reason it's always packed, even on the week nights. It's a local place and it's been there for years and their cheese ravioli is to die for, melt in your mouth die for. We always start with those as an appetizer. You will never go wrong with whatever you order but they always have at least two specials, I highly recommend those. They are always amazing, whether it be fresh fish or an Osso Busso  or Rack of Lamb. When they say special they really mean it is something very special for that night only. Tutti Santi is incredible, truly"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, some of the best Italian I've had in a long time. Locals tell me that this is some of the best Italian you will find in the area. It makes a big difference when it's this good!

BEAUTIFUL!"}
{"text":"This delightful Italian restaurant is located in a strip mall, but don't let that fool you. Once you enter the restaurant doors you enter an atmosphere reminiscent of a fine Italian ristorante. The menu is filled with many choices from veal to fish, and obviously, homemade pasta. The food is delicious and will also remind you of Italy. The service is prompt, courteous and knowledgeable. We can't wait to return again and again to try more items in the menu."}
{"text":"great place for a fancier dinner for the family. a bit pricy however big portions so you could always share."}
{"text":"I was craving Italian food while on an anniversary trip with my husband.  Decided to try this place since it was within walking distance of our resort.  Glad we did!  I had the ravioli, which was not what I intended on having, but I'm glad I did.  I normally steer clear of anything with ricotta cheese but decided to go for it.  The ravioli was homemade with ricotta cheese and spinach.  It had a mixture of white and red sauce and was delicious.  The sauce was just enough to cover the ravioli but not over-bearing.  The hubs had the chicken florentine and it was also very good. I'm not exactly sure what kind of sauce it had but it tasted like a wine sauce of sorts.  It came with two decent sized chicken breasts covered in spinach and topped with sauce with a side of penne pasta that had what I assume was a tomato-type sauce.  Very good!  They provide you with a basket full of delicious and plentiful garlic bread.  The service was great and the atmosphere was very nice.  It's located in the corner of a strip mall.  We wore jeans with nice shirts, I saw some people in shorts and others were dressed pretty nice...dresses, collared shirts, etc.  If you're looking for good, authentic Italian food, this is the place!!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience in long time. A table of unruly 8 children while their parents sat at next table acting oblivious. Children ran about including bumping our chairs & table routinely and yelling one another. It felt a Mc Donald's play room.
Manager said it's a family restaurant.
Our last meal."}
{"text":"Talk about shocked, and not in a good way. I haven't been having good luck with Yelp lately apparently.

My in laws just moved to Gilbert and asked me to recommend a place for dinner close to them. Of course I consult yelp and thought this place would be a slam dunk because of the great reviews. Wrong :(

We walk in and the atmosphere is really awkward. It was dead silent and everyone was staring at us because the seating arrangement is super close and awkward. They have white linens, which typically indicates more upscale, but then they have a tv blaring in the background at the bar?

The service was great (until the end). I would agree with other yelpers that they are way too anxious to clear plates. They were on it, but I thought it was ridiculous to ask my sister in law to take her plate away when there was practically a full salad on it and she was still eating it. Get a clue! 

But I was very happy that our waters were refilled, bread baskets kept coming, I dropped my fork and they brought me another in like 2 seconds...very attentive service.

Despite the excellent service and the ok atmosphere (rearrange the seating and get rid of the tv!), it really is all about the FOOD am I right?

This is where this place completely falls apart for me. They simply cannot justify charging the high prices they charge. The quality and execution simply do not match the price. And don't get me wrong, I have NO problem shelling out for great food (I went to Kai for my birthday for crying out loud), but these prices offend me here.

We ordered calamari and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers. Calamari was rubbery and the garlic and white wine sauce had no flavor and arrived luke warm and got cold in like 1 min. Mushrooms were tough and chewy and too salty.

My husband ordered the veal francese. Veal was tough. I just didn't like the combo of flavors but that could be a matter of taste. No excuse for the veal though. His dish came with a side of pasta, which was burned. Totally inedible. I wanted to send it back but my husband hates sending things back and \"making a scene\".

I had the ravioli. It was excellent. I could tell the pasta was homemade and fresh.

SIL had the chicken parmesan with a side of fettucine alfredo. She said the chicken was dry and the breading was soggy. It did appear that way. The fettucine alfredo was very good.

Her husband got the special - veal with gorgonzola sauce. Same problem with the veal, tough overcooked. The sauce was pretty good.

It took FOREVER for our check to come out. Not sure what that was about since they were very attentive the rest of the meal. Our bill came to $123 and change. Keep in mind - no drinks, no dessert, and I had an appetizer for my meal. OUTRAGEOUS for some pretty mediocre food.

If you do take your chances going here, I would only get the pasta dishes. Everything else we got was not good. And you probably won't get out of there for under $100.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice with my dad who is apparently a VIP.  He travels to Phoenix frequently and always comes here for dinner. The staff is exceptional and welcoming. The food is great, may i say...fancy. Some pasta sauces can be a bit on the salty side but not so bad that it doesn't taste good. Desserts are a must so save room!  Also don't forget to get a shot at the end of the meal. 

Make sure you have reservations because this place is small and people love it. It's always packed. They use open table for reservations as well!"}
{"text":"Friday for date night the hubby picked the restaurant.  We had movie tiks @ iPIC for later that night so this was close and somewhere we hadn't tried.  We made reservations the day of and headed into Scottsdale.  We arrived a tad early and had to wait a few minutes.  Lots of smaller tables for the two of us were available but could have been reserved for other parties.  We were greeted by who I can only imagine to be the owner and the hostess.  Both were trying to do the same thing.  Several waiters gave us the stink eye and I'm not sure how much I enjoyed that part while waiting.  

We were finally seated and waited a while for someone to take drink orders or explain the specials they may have that night.  Bread was dropped off.  Literally just thrown on the table and water delivered.  Napkins were placed on laps (which didn't make sense - if you are going to throw bread @ me - don't feel obligated to place my napkin for me)  anyway letting it go....  Our waiter finally came over.  He was either intimidated, on drugs or truly just couldn't be bothered by our table.  He couldn't look me in the eyes the entire time while rattling off the specials.  He would look outside - up @ the ceiling - down @ the floor - other tables - anything from looking me @ directly.  We ordered drinks, appetizers and he went on his merry way.  We waited a while for everything to arrive.  

My melon and prosciutto was amazing.  Perfect sweet to salty in every bite.  Yummy.  DH ordered the gnocchi.  There are no words that I will ever be able to use to explain this stuff to you.  It was like butter.  If you've ever had cotton candy and experienced it when it melts in your mouth.  Without the sweet.  This is what this gnocchi tasted like.  It literally melted in your mouth.  No chewing necessary.  Just savoring it all.  The white sauce with the ever so slight bit of red sauce to accompany it was PERFECT!!  IT was soooo delish.  Two days later he wants to go back for more.  Buckets and buckets he says.  I ordered the lasagna and Josh ordered the tortellini.  The lasagna was pedestrian.  It was ok.  Nothing like the gnocchi.  And the best part of the tortellini was those mushrooms.  Man those were delish!  It was sooo good.  

There was a couple celebrating what I have to assume was her b-day next to us.  We were treated by Mama Tutti coming over to her table and singing to her in Italian.  IT was terrific.  What a treat."}
{"text":"To start off if I could give more stars I would.

We wanted a nice local restaurant and found Tutti Santi.  Oh my goodness.  We had a party of 10 and our waiter was awesome!!! Very attentive, funny, answered our questions, and even one of our teenagers wanted to adopt as her grandpa.

We got stuffed mushrooms and Prosciutto e Melone for appetizers.  Both were delicious!!

Soup - cream of potato and carrot with a hint of kick at the end.  Really liked the soup.

Salad - shredded romaine or green leaf lettuce with a slice of Roma tomato and dressed with the perfect amount of a balsamic/oil vinaigrette. 

7 of us ordered something different with three ordering the same dish: 

Homemade Gnocchi-  to die for, they melted in your mouth and just the perfect amount of sauce

Orange Roughy Genovese with Penne Aglio E. Olio - fish melted in your mouth with the perfect lemon butter sauce with caper and artichoke hearts and small serving of penne pasta with olive oil and garlic sauce.  Probably never find that great taste anywhere else.

Chicken Parmigiana with Spaghetti al Pamadoro - tasted great, but the one who ate it prefers a heavier breading on the chicken. This one has a light breading.

Homemade ravioli Allan Nina - definitely homemade and fresh cheese light tomato sauce.  Good.

Spaghetti el bolognese- added sausage.  It was really good but \"not as good as my moms\".  It was eaten all up.

Veal Parmigiana with Spaghetti al Pamadoro - tender sliced and lightly breaded veal cutlets, served with spaghetti and tomato sauce. Eaten all up. Only complaint was the cheese melted on top of veal overpowered the taste of the veal.

Chicken al Momento with Spaghetti - loads of chunky tomato sauce and spaghetti noodles

Veal cutlets topped with asparagus and
Crab meat, fontina cheese, Marsala sauce without mushrooms.  Eaten all up.

Everyone cleaned their plates, using the bread we were given to \"mop\" up the sauce.

Authentic Italian food!!!!

We even had a magician come to our table for entertainment. He was really good.  Great ending to a wonderful night.

You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Tried to have a romantic dinner at this place with m y wife. Food was great, but the service not so good. Rude wait staff. Maybe a Jersey thing?? but I'm from Jersey and wasn't feeling the love..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is only half a block away from the Pointe Hilton and provided our family with a great dining experience.  Everyone in our party loved their meal.  I was especially glad to have chosen the evening speciality of Cioppino. It came with mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp, and orange roughy served over linguini; a wonderful dish.
Our server, Jen, took great care of us and made sure all our needs were met."}
{"text":"La cena era deliziosa!  The meal was delicious!

I love Italian food, and when I am lucky enough to visit somewhere that does it really well, I am in my own version of Heaven.  

The experience started off with the shrimp scampi appetizer - large shrimp served in a light lemon white wine butter sauce with just the right amount of garlic.  Next came the best ravioli I have ever tasted.  Delicate thin pasta surrounded ricotta cheese and spinach, and was topped with a cream and tomato sauce.  Simple, classic and oh so very good!  My friend had the linguine with clams in white wine garlic sauce which was also fantastic.  Did we save room for dessert?  Heck yes!  The tiramisu was the perfect finish.

Hands down the best Italian I have had since moving to AZ.  Try it, you'll like it too!!"}
{"text":"Anniversary and Valentine's dinner with my wife was outstanding. Excellent waiter service with special attention. The food was to die for. Terrific bread, followed by a green salad with dressing that was light with an unbelievable taste. Dinner was ravioli on her side, and a shrimp linguine with a cognac white sauce on mine. Really really good food and great atmosphere.Thank you all for making our evening special"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants I've eaten at in a while where you feel the true Italian experience from A+ cuisine to the service and attention to each customers needs. My Mother has allergies to a few things food related and Debora (I hope I spelled that right) was extremely helpful and my family & I had an amazing dinner. We are from Philly, so we are picky with our Italian restaurants too. Thanks everyone at Tutti Santi for a great evening all around. I look forward to coming back ASAP."}
{"text":"Dinner at the bar.  I've visited the other Tutti's and enjoyed them,  but this, the original,  is my favorite.  An attentive, accommodating bartender gave me glasses of a wine I love,  even though it isn't listed on the menu as by the glass. This immediately won me over.  Had the house salad with their own very good balsamic vinaigrette.  Opted for the special that night,  a ciopinno that was chock full of seafood and a flavorful broth. Didn't eat the bread,  but fellow diners told me it was great. They also raved about their pasta dishes,  one had gnocchi and the other ravioli.  Convivial atmosphere.  I enjoyed it very much and would go back."}
{"text":"I'm not going to go into as much detail as I normally do in a review.

Bottom line, the food is just really good.   We were there on Saturday night and there wasn't a bad dish amongst the four of us.   We had a veal special, the Veal Francese, the Cioppino, and the Tortellini Panna Rosa and we loved them all.  And I really liked the extra touch of a Sambuca after dessert.

And everyone there is family....very personable servers who seem to remember every client like they are old friends.

Is the restaurant a bit dated, is the salad a little boring....maybe.  But this isn't a chain, its a family owned/operated place, and you'll feel like family too by the time you leave."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family and oh how dark this place was inside. I am surprised that I didn't trip on anything in there. There was a group of 8 and the restaurant was very accommodating in terms of seating. In general, the food was a 4 star. Great flavors, great pasta, and deliciousness overall! Since there were 8 of us, I was able to get a little taste of everything. I would highly recommend getting one of the veal pasta entrees. The meat was cut and cooked perfectly. My sister ordered a gnocchi and this was seriously the best I've ever had! It was so buttery and just melts on your mouth. 

I'm knocking down 1 star because of service. Our server obviously liked the table next to us more because 1) he offered fresh pepper to the other group when he served them salad and soup but he didn't do so for us - mind that this was minutes apart 2) he didn't offer fresh pepper again when he brought out the dinner so we had to ask him for some, and 3) he only focused on serving the other table because they ordered a bottle of wine so he thought he was going to get better tips. He didn't take away our dirty appetizer plates so we had a bunch of small plates at the end of the table piling up. 

From this experience, I would go back for food but if I had the same server a again I would leave."}
{"text":"We had a mixed experience here last night. The interior is pleasant, and we had an enjoyable time most of the evening despite disconnects with the food.

My wife's salmon was perfectly cooked -- cooked through but still moist and tender. Beautifully done. Bravo to the line cook. But the sauce wasn't just tart, it was sour and so thick that it came across almost like a bottled sauce.

We had that same feeling with a mushroom barley soup, which had a smooth and oddly thickened broth for what they claim is a \"homemade\" Italian soup. It was okay, but certainly had no soffritto or fesh base of any kind.

The gnocchi was on the dense side, and the cream and tomato sauce was underseasoned.

Finally, the Parmesan cheese. It's not freshly grated. It's in a little glass jar, and looks and smells and tastes like the stuff out of the green cardboard cylinder. Yet another cheap shortcut.

Despite all this, we were enjoying our wine and having a good time when the check arrived. We'd used a Groupon, and the waitress had already written in the tip for 20% of the full amount. Okay, fine, that's about what she should expect, but it made us feel bad. She didn't trust us to tip her because we'd used a Groupon, so she did the math for us, and to change the tip we'd have had to make a fuss. 

Mediocre food isn't the end of the world, but being made to feel cheap and untrustworthy ruined the evening."}
{"text":"I ate dinner at the Scottsdale location last night, and to say I was disappointed is an understatement!  Our server's name was Sarah and she was horrible!!!  She never checked on us until the food was ready to be served and when the check was being prepared at the end of the meal.  We ordered our food and drinks immediately, however the only order that we received was my drink?  As mentioned previously, Sarah must have decided that she really didn't care about our table because we didn't see here again for almost 30 minutes.....when the salads finally arrived.  I guess you can call it a salad? Five leafs of lettuce and a half of a cherry tomato!!!   I actually had to get up to order a drink for my guest, and the Bar Tender barely acknowledged my request, seemed annoyed that he had to actually make a drink and continued talking to a couple at the Bar.  The only attention we received was from the busgirl, who was great!  The food was good, not great.....however based on the service I received and the cost of the meal, I will not support Tutti Santi at the Scottsdale location again.  I am upset with myself that I left a tip, but the busgirl deserved something."}
{"text":"This was a gem. Looked to Yelp for reviews and they were spot on. Old fashioned Italian restaurant decor for an old fashioned family style Italian meal. The food was excellent, tender shrimp, a pink sauce to die for and cioppino special that was literally filled with seafood that was full of flavor. Not hipster gourmet fare, but hearty, flavorful food with spectacular service."}
{"text":"Friendly, attentive staff and amazing handmade pasta make this a winner!"}
{"text":"First time dining here. The menu is diversified but too pricey compared to other similar restaurants in the Scottsdale area. I asked for the music to be turned down twice and although they weren't busy, it never happened. 

The food was fresh but very bland. Salad was plain and the dressing was non descript. I ordered their evening special-Osso Buco ($30.00 range) and although it was tender, the sauce tasted like gravy. The vegetables in the dish were way over cooked, appared mashed. The sauce can make or break this entree.  I was dining with a business associate and didn't feel comfortable complaining given the circumstance. We were heading to an event afterward and didn't have time to re-order with the service being pretty slow for 5pm on a Weds. night.  She ordered salmon off the menu, it looked good but overpriced at $24.95. There are far better/more upscale places that are superior.  I was disappointed overall and won't be back."}
{"text":"I spotted this Italian restaurant on Yelp when I was looking for something close by the resort where I was staying. The reviews looked good so I booked a table. When I arrived, I saw the restaurant in a nondescript strip shopping center which gave me pause briefly. However the second I walked in I knew I was in something special. When I walked through the door (and through the crowd waiting for tables) I had been transported to Italy. 

When I spotted a chair at the bar, I gave up my table and headed that way. The busy bartender greeted me immediately and asked me what I wanted to drink. He then helped me select a glass of wine. As time went on, I got some advice on their special dishes and ended up with a seafood pasta dish. 

The restaurant was very busy but I never felt ignored. The service was great and the food was wonderful. Tutti Santi is a perfect, small neighborhood Italian restaurant. I highly recommend you visit."}
{"text":"What a total disappointment.  I had such high hopes for this restaurant. Reserved table for 8 one week in advance. A celebration dinner that was supposed to have excellent food and service for our guest and party.  The food was awful, the service SO SLOW, the food took over an hour...yes over an hour to appear and did I say the service was awful?  I will tell you the bread was good.  But that is about it. For the prices you would think the salad with the entr√©e would include more than lettuce and one tomato.  NOPE...don't expect it a plate of lettuce is all you will get.  The chicken parmigiana  was rubbery and very very thin and hard to cut. The lasagna was mush. Three people ordered the lasagna and the consensus was a plate of MUSH.
We called 1 week in advance for this party and the food took over an hour to get to us, why take reservations if you overbook and cant get the food out in a timely manner? Stay away from this place, don't make the same mistake."}
{"text":"I was actually quite disappointed the last time I stew here! I normally have wonderful service, but not this time. I brought a group of 8 people and the service was very slow. In fact, I had to stop someone and ask them to wait on us. I usually sit at the bar, but this time with such a large party we sat at a table. I was embarrassed because I raved about this place so much to these people and it didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"The food was very good but I wasn't crazy about the stuffed mushrooms! They weren't bad but they weren't great either! I had veal franchese and it was very good. The veal melted in your mouth and the flavor was outstanding. It comes with pasta with tomato sauce which wasn't bad. The caesar salad with anchovies was really good and they pour a very healthy glass of wine! I ain't mad at 'em! :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. True Italian ambience. Best Italian food I've had in a long time. Our waiter was the best. Will definitely be going back next time I visit my son."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Tutti Santi is a close knit family/friends restaurant ran by an amazing man names Leo.  His passion for this establishment is undeniable and catches fire to the rest of his staff. 

The food is phenomenal and the service is amazing.  John was our server when we celebrated a family birthday and he was the most patient and genuine being you could ever meet. 

The service and experience we received made our family gathering special and much more memorable. 

Thank you Leo and John! 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the best Italian food we have tried in Arizona. The food, ambiance, and service is phenomenal. The first time we came was for my birthday. We loved the food so much we went back the next weekend and our server remembered us and the fact that I was vegetarian. I can't put into words how amazing this place is. You definitely need to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing personalized service and the most fabulous food! Best Italian I've had (and I've been to Italy). Amazing service started with a phone call around noon asking if they served \"gluten free pasta\" as this was the closest Italian place to our Hotel while we were visiting. The owner, Roberto, answered and said \"No, but I can go out and buy you some for dinner tonight - what time will you be coming in\". I thought - wow, this is a random person calling and the owner, who doesn't even know if I'll really show up, is going to go buy me special pasta. So that's what happened. We came in at 8:00pm and all of the staff was waiting for our arrival, greeted us by name and Roberto had the special GF pasta waiting for me. The dish I ordered was the special that came with all sorts of seafood and a red tomato sauce - it was OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious! The food is awesome, the staff is super and Roberto is GREAT! I will return here when visiting Phoenix again."}
{"text":"My gosh! This food was so delicious I was uncomfortably full, but I still ate the left overs. All week I have been looking for something great and the bell hop at the Hilton pointe suggested this place. It was truly wonderful. The bread was very well seasoned with a large mount of garlic. I had the chefs special with the seafood, a combination of many different seafoods. It was amazing. The rest of our party had the veal and loved it. The tiramisu was wonderful and they threw in a shot on the house with every desert ordered. The staff were so friendly and very personable. The Wine was great! I wish we had gone here every night of our vacation."}
{"text":"Big Bone.....Small Fork! Bet your wondering what I mean. Ill get to that shortly. 
 This was my first time eating at Tutti. it was never a place that bleeped on my radar. I mean, c'mon; It's in a Fry's strip mall. What piqued my attention was the automobiles and the line outside this joint. It looked like Goodfellas. I am noticing a Bently....Powder Blue??? A Maserati QP and an Orange Lamborghini. I told my Wife that there is something going on here. With the line and steady stream of business it was time to try. 
 Again, it is in a strip mall, Which is where often times you find a gem. Found one!! The inside is tiny and quaint. The flavors on the food are bold. My Wife and I went traditional. Linguini w/ Clams for her, and Veal Osso Bucco for me. Now, the rest of the story.....
 My Osso Bucco took a long time to be ready....I actually like that. It was very hot, extremely tender and the stock/gravy was Killer. The Shank was roasted so well that the marrow inside was PERFECT. They put a lobster fork in the shank, something that is done in much finer Restaurants than this. I was pleasantly surprised. The Marrow was so good, so rendered that put this dish at about a 8 out of ten. The only person to come close to my Granfathers recipe of Linguini Vongole is Tutti Santi. It was excellent!! The Canoli was fair but the Sambuca that is served with every dessert  is a very, very nice accoutrement. I will be back to try something different."}
{"text":"First of all, everything in Arizona closes hella early, so as a last resort at about 9 o'clock we went to this fancy schmancy joint for dinner. Little did we know that the food would not be as up to scale as the dimly lit decorations. My sister and I got chicken Cesar salads with chicken that was very dry and seemed and tasted like end of the day scraps. Also my brother-in-law's salmon and muscles tasted like sea water which resulted in bubble guts later that night. On top of all this, Tutti Santi is also pretty pricey. $15 for a minuscule could-have-been-rat-for-all-we-know Cesar salad. Good luck dinner goers."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a classic, traditional Italian Restaurant in PHX/Scottsdale, you won't find but one or two restaurants that can compete with Tutti Santi.  Awesome service, drinks, appetizers and entre options.  Best marinara you'll ever taste."}
{"text":"Oh Tutti Santi.  How I love this place!  Whenever I am in town, my mom and I come here for dinner.  That's mostly because it is so close to her house that we feel we can freely consume copious amounts of chianti.  I'm always surprised by how busy this place is given it's location.  Even if you have to wait for a table, head in to the bar where you can expect a generous pour!  

The food is pretty decent, though not inexpensive.  I would best describe it as Italian comfort food.  For some reason, I LOVE the fettucine alfredo, though I'll admit it isn't spectacular. 

Plan to top your meal off with a complimentary shot of sambuca.  Make sure to leave an espresso bean behind for luck!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Tutti Santi for years!  The food is always wonderful. Service is delivered with old world style and charm. The wine list is fabulous and affordable. Greenway and 64th is just as great as the 16th street original location."}
{"text":"Excellent food with outstanding service and very reasonable prices. I had the chicken parmigiana which was excellent. It included a salad and side of homemade pasta."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great atmosphere. The tortellini in cream sauce is close to the best in the city. The eggplant parm is slice very thin which makes it A+. A must try!"}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting Arizona and stayed at a hotel nearby. We googled \"best Italian restaurants in Phoenix\" and this restaurant came up so we thought we would give it a try. We had a such a great experience at this restaurant! The vibe is very authentic Italian, which my Italian family loved. All four of us ordered different pasta dishes and we loved each and every one of them! In addition to the great food, the service was fantastic! Our waiter was very friendly, and made sure that we were happy throughout the meal. At the end of the meal, he actually bought each of us a round of the shots that are come out on fire! Overall, a great experience and would definitely come back again next time I am in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to see the Tutti Santi sign go up after the last restaurant here closed. The food is just as good as the other locations, and the manager (Jimmy) really cares about doing a good job. 
All 4 of us loved our meals: lasagna, spaghetti, ravioli and linguini with clams. I love that you can taste that the food is homemade. Our server was friendly, fast and attentive- my drink was never empty and I'm one of those people that goes through like 6 waters per meal. 
Others have mentioned high prices- Tutti Santi's isn't cheap, but it's also very good. I'd pick this over a cheaper chain any day."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  My family and I came here for dinner before I had to catch a flight back home.  Vince was our server and I highly recommend him!!  He was so accommodating to the fact that we had less than an hour to eat our dinner.  He was so great to us.  The food was delicious!!  I highly recommend the bolognese with sausage.  Very scrumptious and the bread they serve you first is delicious as well.  Definitely recommend this establishment if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My 3 star rating is truly based on an A-OK meal.  The service was great and compensated for an average meal that was overpriced.  I ordered the Orange Roughy Genovese which was OK at best.  They do have a diverse wine selection that I thought out performed the meal."}
{"text":"By far my best dining experience on my visit to Phoenix.  The waiter suggested a bottle of wine with our dinner choices, Pinot Nero, Sartori - Veneto, it was perfect!!!  Beef Carpaccio for our appetizer, simply divine!!!  I ordered the Chicken Della Casa for dinner, the chicken was pounded out to perfection and the flavors were simply wonderful, I ate it all!!!  Even the marinara sauce on the side of pasta was perfect.  My colleague had the Red Snapper and he was equally satisfied.  We decided to share the Tiramisu  which we were informed was housemade, we were certainly not at all disappointed, the best I have ever had!  Our waiter was great, I actually wrote down his name but now I cannot find it :-(   I have absolutely no reason whatsoever not to give this restaurant 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice for happy hour. Here is what we had:

Calamari - some of the best calamari we have had. The breading is SO light...and with a little squeeze of lemon and the marinara sauce - YUM! (they will do it sauteed as well)

Gnocchi - TO DIE FOR - I've never had such melt in your mouth gnocchi! I could eat it everyday

Ravioli - super fresh - the pasta to filling ratio was spot on and over all very tasty!

Jimmy the waiter/bartender is super friendly and has made us feel so welcome each time.

We hope that more people will start frequenting this restaurant  :) Worth the happy hour"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food!! The Raviolis are a Must! Chicken Parm and lasagna are the Best I've had."}
{"text":"My 1st time here, the food was fresh and authentic, the best Italian food I've had since Ive lived in AZ. 
Make sure you try the ravioli, it's to die for, melts in your mouth! 
Our server, Giovanni was attentive and very friendly.
Giovanni gave us complimentary shots of Sambuca, the perfect end to our meals. 
Perfect place for date night or for celebrations. 
Reservations are a must. 
Would love to come back!"}
{"text":"I discovered Tutti Santi about 6 weeks ago.  I have eaten there 4 times since.  The first two I had appetizer of Carpaccui de Bue.  Excellent both times.  Thinly sliced raw filet mignon topped with diced tomatoes, capers, basil, provolone shavings and olive oil. 
The third time I had Spaghetti Bolognese-excellent.  The fourth time I had the Veal Oso Buco which they only have in November or they don't start serving until November. Not sure which.  Large portion had to take home for next nights meal.  The sauce was delectable but I would add a few more chopped veggies and safron. 
I think the atmosphere is homey and old style Italian.  Service is terrific.
Prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Hostess was awful. Took over 45 mins to be seated for our reservation even though the table was available. Would have left if it wasn't for a friend who traveled an hour to this restaurant. Last time we all dine there."}
{"text":"You must get the ravioli di nina!  The best ravioli I've ever had.  The atmosphere was nice. The staff was so kind and accommodating to find us a table quickly even though we had no reservation on a Saturday night.  They made my birthday very special."}
{"text":"Came here for a graduation celebration.  The family has been coming here since the owner has opened - 17 yrs I think he said?  We came as a party of 30 people and we had the place to ourselves for lunch since they are only opened for dinner.  They knew the owner that well.  
Everything was great.  The owner is definitely a people person and was on top of things.  Even his staff was great.  We started with appetizers.  The ravioli was ok.  Think it was handmade.  I'm not a fan usually so just ok to me.  The calamari was good - pretty standard though.  I liked the mozzarella caprese b/c they had it with sauteed peppers and olives.  Bt those 3 and the bread, we had a meal right there.
For the entree I had the Chicken Imperiale with Mixed Vegetables - chicken stuffed with fresh crab and shrimp topped with a light mushroom sauce.  This came recommended by the mom.  It was SO good!  The chicken with the crab and shrimp were done well but it was the mushroom sauce that had me.  It wasn't too thick or overwhelming.  So flavorful.  I could just eat that with the bread and I'd be happy.  I had leftovers and asked the server if I could have extra sauce.  He didn't think so since they make it fresh.  When he brought me back my food wrapped up, I found out that they had MADE me extra sauce and put it in my container.  BIG BONUS and BIG PLUS for them on customer service!!!  Oh I was a happy camper.  Hence why they get that 5th star.

Had cheesecake for dessert that they make fresh there.  Yum!  Simple.  

I looked at their website and saw they have other locations with dif. menu.  It seems like all the others have the same menu where they do fresh pasta.  This location is the only that is different. Will have to try it somewhere else."}
{"text":"Tutti Santi is one of our valley jewels. Nina is so wonderful, I hope you can meet her -- her hospitality and joy in preparing a feast for you and your guests is very hard to match.

I went to celebrate a friend's birthday, so I started with a bottle of champagne. I know it's very Reunite of me, but I like Spumanti. And there it was on the list. Excellent. Followed with a bottle of Pinot Gris, but it was too cold.

Linguine with Clams was divine. Didn't have the creamy thickness of the lavish dish I had in Venice last month until I dumped half the shaker's Parmesan on top (ok, it was closer to 3/4 of the shaker), but oh, SO good. The sourdough bread was hot and fresh -- mmm, my favorite.

We finished off with a flaming shot of licorice liqueur. I wasted so much time taking a picture of it, the glass burned my lips when I actually got to tasting it. LOL.

Tutti is not pretentious, just very good food and excellent service. A must try."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Tutti Santi's...as usual the food was amazing...

The wait was extremely long....even with reservations we waited for more than an hour. The waiting process was very disorganized and the staff seem extremely overburdened. Once we were sat at the table, everything flowed fairly well...a bit rushed and hectic but the server was attentive and friendly and the food was good."}
{"text":"What a great find! We purchased a deal chicken for this restaurant as we had never tried before. We had an absolutely fabulous dinner start to finish. We started with Caprese salad and stuffed mushrooms both were very good, then for entrees, we had Chicken florentina and Pasta romantico. Both sauces were the best we have had! The atmosphere is like you are in Italy. I would have never figured from the location but we will be regulars."}
{"text":"What an amazing time I had with my husband! We were celebrating 5 years of marriage a night early and decided to try it out here! Loved it!! Not only did I love our waiter, Vince , but the owner greeted us at the end of our dinner.. We had an amazing time, great laughs and everyone in the restaurant was offered a free shot after dinner to honor past, present and future!!! We truly enjoyed this!!!  


To the owner : past, present and behind  hubby and I are still laughing! Thanks for an amazing time :) 



We had the raviolis for an app!!! Amazing!!!!! For dinner I had spaghetti and meatballs ( sausage) delicious! My husband had a Fish special ! We definitely will be back when visiting Arizona"}
{"text":"The best Italian Restaurant in the Valley!  We've dined here many times, and the food and service has been stayed consistent.  They really stay true to what \"Italian\" food is supposed to taste like. Very authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"WOW!!

Some friends of ours invited us out to dinner this past friday. She told me it wasn't far.. LOL!! We live near Anthem.. so to me this was a serious hike. However!!! It was SO- SOOO worth it. I am NOT a big italian fan... or so I thought. 
My husband had the ravioli, and with every bite he would tell me how incredible it was. :)
I went with the salmon and veggies. WOW!! The lemon butter sauce was devine! I rarely am a member of the clean plate club, but I seriously found myself wanted to lick the plate clean. (don't worry I did contain myself) 
So I have to say... I thought I was not an italian fan. Apparently I just haven't been lucky enough to find some GREAT italian food. 
2 thumbs WAY UP!!
Warning.. it is a little on the pricey side. The ambience is very nice and it is worth it."}
{"text":"I brought someone to show the place off because I love it and honestly I felt embarrassed that I talked it up so much.  Tonight 5.8.15 @8:30 

Two reasons why i still have this place three stars and only these two reasons. The food was phenomenal as always! And Roberto who I am almost positive was not our server treated us with crazy good service and mad us feel special and welcomed not the same could be said of our \"server\" who was laughing it up with the table next to us but could even greet us till 10 min after we sat down. The gracious host grabbed us waters. And suggested wine for us which was much appreciated and very sweet. All in all I honestly don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Although the food and menu were impressive I am definitely turned off by this place. WHY why would the owners use that location! It's in a old grungy strip-mall right next to Fry's which more than often omits a nasty sewer stink! The atmosphere of this place is what needs the most work. I mean I don't want to order expensive food while sitting window side with a beautiful view of McDonald's! Please relocate Tutti Santi atmosphere IS important!"}
{"text":"Best homemade raviolis & veal Canneloni. We will definitely come here again. Thanks Trace for your awesome service"}
{"text":"My 1st experience at Tutti Santi was  over Labor Day .  We  stayed at Point Hilton Squaw Peak and wanted desperately  to eat off the Hotel Property and saw Tutti Santi tucked into a small corner nearby.   Everything was amazing! Great ambiance, Attentive Service, maybe too attentive but we were in the Small Room.
 My Daughter ordered the homemade Ravioli.  Raviolis  tasted amazing the  sauce was rich and pleasurable! My Eggplant Parmesan made my taste buds dance and my other daughter had a pasta w artichokes mushrooms in a garlic cream, sauce little too garlicky for her and a little for me as well but she wouldn't ask for another dish so oh well..
 Dessert  was a Tiramisu and a Spumoni Ice cream dipped in  hardened chocolate. They were both amazing..taste and in presentation. Our attentive and friendly waiter offered a sambuca shot after my meal as an aperitif I gladly  enjoyed :) Our bill was pricey but worth every penny.
My daughter has proclaimed this is now Her FAVORITE restaurant. I am on board with this as well"}
{"text":"Great Italian food and served in a super cute atmosphere.  The service was good and our waiter was very attentive to our table. The food was great...we started with the Gnocchi which was wonderful! I had the Chicken Marsala and also tried some of the Lasagna...both were fantastic.  The best part of the night was the wonderful Chianti that was suggested to us and the shot of Sambuca that was brought to us after our dinner, compliments of the house.  i would give this place a try if you are looking for a great Italian dinner...everyone that has been from my recommendation, LOVED it. :)"}
{"text":"As others have written, Nina's ravioli is fabulous.  The snails in garlic butter could have used more garlic.  The gnocchi was better than average.  The wine list was just okay.  Very cozy atmosphere -- unexpected given the way the mall looks from the outside.  Excellent service, including complimentary sambuca with coffee beans as a digestif.  All in all, very good Italian food and a restaurant worth another visit."}
{"text":"Tutti Santi is a beautiful Italian Restaurant.  one of the only true forms of what Italian should be located here in Phoenix.  I had my first experience at the restaurant on Greenway and 64th for my birthday recently.  I was surprised with the size of the restaurant. Much smaller then what i had anticipated but i loved it.  The small place provided the necessary decor and ambiance to really establish bistro as a fine dining Establishment.   I had the Veal Marsela which i had to say was fantastic.  Just the right amount of sauce to really, and the wine i had went great with the veal.  Everyone that i was with loved the food and our waiter was excellent.  I even had the host i believe its the owners mother sing me happy birthday in Italian.  I love the place 5stars. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this place. The service was awesome. Our server was a New Yorker and he really made the experience great. It's just so nice when a server actually knows their product and helps guide you through the ordering process. This guy was great. The food was exceptional too. Antipasto was fresh and exceptional. I had a stuffed chicken dish that was out of this world. I'm hard to please sometimes as I lived for many years in Upstate New York, but they passed my test...We will be back.

We went for a 2nd time last Wed and it was even better this time. Head Waiter Jimmie is incredibly awesome. He reminds me of the Italian waiters from back in NY. Classy-cool! Ask for him."}
{"text":"Ate there last Sunday {Easter} with a party of 8. Even though the place was packed, the food and the service was impeccable. We were not rushed at all.  John, our excellent waiter,  did a fantastic job, as usual. Bene Grazie. Highly recommend this beautiful Italian restaurant. They treat you like family. The Veal Cannelloni was to die for."}
{"text":"Went the other night to celebrate a bday. Started with a combination of the regular ravioli and the special ravioli which was chicken and sausage. We also had the prosciutto with some toasted bread. Then came salads then the osso bucco. We had paired some brunello and amarone to go with the meal. When the dust had settled there is not one thing that could have been better. Everything for the entire evening was perfect. It was easily one of the best dining experiences that I have ever had. I could not have been more pleased. Thank you to everyone at Tutti Santi for making it a special evening."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food at this restaurant.  I must admit I have only dined in twice, and both times were exceptional service and food.  But I discovered this restaurant originally on DoorDash.  I was blown away by the quality, portion size and flavor.  I'm serious.  It is consistently excellent.  One of my favorites is the caprese salad and the melon and proscuitto.  You cannot go wrong.  The pastas are so good you will want to over eat.  At least I did.  Always enough for two meals."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, but the food was so so. Service was fine (sat at the bar), but when they get busy there seems to be a lot of work placed on to one person while a lot of other workers stand around. Pretty pricy."}
{"text":"I'll make this a quick one. Food was really, really good! My wife and I walked In at 5:05pm. They open at 5. 7 people in the dining room. A waitress asked us if we had reservations and we said no. She literally rolled her eyes. Not a good first impression. She said she had one table and we had to be done by 6:30. No worries I said. Place was empty the entire dinner until we left at 6:00. I knew this would happen. I loved the food and the atmosphere was cozy, but why the roll of the eyes? Come on people. It wasn't a big deal. My hat goes off to the chefs but the waitress should lose the attitude."}
{"text":"You will need reservations. Service was excellent! The Escargot may have been the best I've ever had. Seriously, it was perfection. Our waiter recommended the special but I opted for the  Pappardelle ai Porcini & Gamberi. It was good. I prefer just a tad bit more sauce on my pasta. We plan on returning."}
{"text":"Fabulous place! The food really is to die for. Great service at bar. (we always eat at the bar). Best Italian around Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by various websites, so I gave it a shot when I was in Scottsdale. The service was great and the food was good. 

We sat in the bar area which was lively. It feels like a neighborhood hangout, so everyone looked like they were friends and having a good time."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian Experiences I had in Phoenix.Would recommend to anyone who loves a fine dining place."}
{"text":"NEVER DISAPPOINTED!  We visited the Tutti Santi on Via Linda last night. It has been about six or seven months since my last visit to Tutti Santi. My husband and I adore this place. The food is exceptional. I started out with Malbec Amado Sur Trivento and it was lovely. We both love italian food and I wish our place back home was this good. My husband ordered spaghetti and I ordered Involtini di melenzane (ricotta cheese and spinach filled eggplant in a marinara sauce topped with mozzarella). Oh my gosh, it was delicious, and my husband's spaghetti was out of this world. The salad we had was very good. They are very generous with bread and dipping oil as well. The staff has always been very friendly but not intrusive. I love the atmosphere with the chandeliers and I found a wine cellar where there is an intimate table for two to enjoy different wines. The decor is very nice. I just love going to this restaurant. I did not think prices were too expensive. My dinner was $10.95 and my husband's was abouh $16.00. Well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Great food. So, why the 1 star review? Walked in and the restaurant was so stifling that I couldn't breathe. Asked for the air to be turned on. I received a snide comment. Then they cranked the air on so high that everyone in the restaurant was shivering. Someone at another table asked for it to be turned down. The waiter said \"well, if it wasn't for those people over there (us) it wouldn't be so cold.\" Thanks jackass. Waiter was rude rest of the night."}
{"text":"I am so grateful to Deal Chicken for featuring this place, otherwise I never would have come here. I visited here tonight with my husband and another couple. We had SO MUCH FUN!!!!  It may have been the wine, it may have been the euphoria of having real Italian food, I don't know, but the conversation was so wonderful, the ambiance was great, and the service was all I could have asked for. I have never had \"authentic Italian food\" (my only experience was the Olive Garden) and now I know what I was missing. The food was so delicate and quaint, yet full of flavor. I upgraded my penne pasta for the infamous gnocchi, and am so glad I did. The Chicken della Casa was wonderful and I have enough left over for lunch tomorrow! My friend had the lasagna, and it was nothing like any type of lasagna I've ever had in the past. There was more than enough food but I didn't walk out of there feeling weighed down, instead we enjoyed several courses over a period of 2 hours and I felt like I truly could have been in Italy."}
{"text":"food was great. no clue who our actually waiter was...different people jumping in and I think the hostess filled our drinks more than anyone else. not sure if the management has changed but this was awful service and rather chaotic. we had one incident that I will save the restaurant the embarrassment but it got some money knocked off our bill. probably won't go back."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, the sauce is what makes or breaks an Italian restaurant.
Having said that, tutti santi has got their sauce down to an art form. It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory but still maintained the freshness of the tomato flavor.

I always get the lasagne anytime I try a new restaurant. I liked their lasagne but i felt the noodles were too soft giving off a mushy texture. Otherwise, very good.

Loved the ambiance and make sure you check out the pictures in the entrance way. And the gentleman who's either the owner or manager to do the lighter thing to one of the pics. You will die laughing and leave with a huge smile on your face. 

Two thumbs up. I will be back!"}
{"text":"\"Great food and service. Would be good to have a kids menus to make it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I know this is a long time area favorite. Frankly, I find the food more 'reliable' than impressive, and the atmosphere dark and dated. We made a late nite decision to stop in for the mocha cheesecake...which is wonderful. The dining room was winding down. We shared we were just in for dessert. Sadly, the waiter seemed miffed that we didn't order drinks or dinner. He was overheard complaining to the kitchen as we left.  Seems a $8 dessert / $3 tip is reasonable given you didn't deliver the item or properly clear the table.  Such a disappointment.
Confirms my preference for Marcellinos"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing and the service is is great, but do not come here on a holiday. We booked our reservation through Open Table at 7:00pm, walked in, and there was a line out the door for RESERVATION check-in. It could be that they overbooked, but It felt like they accepted walk-ins prior to our arrival. If you're going to use technology like OpenTable or even take reservations the analog way, you should expect to honor those first like any normal restaurant. Just put in a policy that if you don't check-in 5 minutes after your reservation time your table will be released....simple. I was expecting to give a 5-star rating after a fabulous Valentine's Day dinner, but cancelled and went to the bar next door. Huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"Upon entering the place has a cozy home feel to it. May be a little too cozy for some as the tables are fairly close to each other. The menu isn't very extensive, lots of pasta, some calamari, chicken and veal.  

My boyfriend and I were seated and had napkins laid on our laps. We were left there , forgotten for about 15 min, while other tables around us were being attended to.  The whole meal went that way, it was not a very pleasant experience and we will not be returning.  Other patrons were offered choices with their entrees, we were not, others were offered sambuca after the meal, we were not. 


I don't want to say that our experience was racial, but it felt that way as I was the only non-white customer in the establishment that night."}
{"text":"This family has been in the valley for years and brought amazing food to the valley!  They have moved around location wise but the food is always the same.  Super rich and yummy."}
{"text":"Drove by many times before dining in one night with 2 kids, and a mother in law. The place is small but well appointed and has dim lighting, just like you'd expect for an Italian place.  The house ravioli is excellent, the recommended starter.  I think I had the tortellini, it was good, big portion, flavorful. After desert, the trimisu and chocolate gnash desert, our waiter dropped off a round of sambucca on the house.  They must do this for everyone, their way of saying thanks.  The service was above average and the cuisine hit the spot with me, so I'll be back again."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The food is amazing as is the service. Get the stuffed mushrooms...but honestly there isn't a bad dish on the menu."}
{"text":"Had a great experience! Went with boyfriend and my parents. I asked for a special request to change up my entree and the chef was perfectly okay with it. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for great Italian!"}
{"text":"My family ate here on the evening of New Year's Eve. The food and service was amazing!  Very family friendly...my kids loved it!  We would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and great atmosphere. Will be going back soon. I was also surprised by the location in a strip mall. But then that's Phoenix for you. When you get inside, all of my apprehension melted away. Perfect calamari, amazingly soft gnocchi and tortellini and veal prepared in a great lemon caper sauce. Next time I'll get the Branzino of its on the special again."}
{"text":"Tutti Santi has been our special family dinner go to place for a few years now.  Each person, even the kids, can find something on the menu they love, and the food is always well prepared.  Nice touches, like a warm greeting when you walk in, the professionalism of the wait staff  (though sometimes inattentive) and sambuca for the adults at the end of the meal, make everyone feel special.  If there's just two of you, the cozy tables in the bar are perfection.

Why not more stars?  It mostly has to do with value.  Other restaurants in Tutti Santi's price range aren't  in a run down strip mall where you don't want to park the nice car you usually take for speical occasions.  It's just not the same in the pick-up truck.  You never ever have to wait long for that first drink or basket of bread at the other places, you can get a better glass of wine, have more choices for the healthy eater, and they pay more attention to things like how close together tables are and room acoustics.  HOWEVER - no one - and I mean no one - can match Tutti Santi's ravioli!  So we'll be back when another special occasion calls for it."}
{"text":"Decided to take a chance on visiting this place after reading Yelp reviews.  The food was okay but our waiter didn't seem to be happy and wasn't very helpful.  Our overall experience is perfectly categorized by the star rating. I've CERTAINLY experienced bette. It would've been better if I walked to the kitchen myself and placed my order to save time dealing with him, and just being more efficient. 
Part of our choice was choosing this because of its close proximity to our vacation home.  Next time, I'll drive further in hopes to not sacrifice on the experience."}
{"text":"I just moved near this location and after driving by it a few times, decided to try it.  I just picked up take out of lasagna with meatsauce for myself, and chicken parm for my hubby.  Both were terrific, and they gave us a huge salad to split and bread as well.  Can't wait to dine in, small but very cute restaurant.  When I stopped in to place my order, it was a Sunday around 5pm and they had a nice crowd.  Very friendly staff.  The server who assisted me with my order suggested that we come in and try the ravioli, their signature dish.  She also said that it's the only dish they don't have available for take out.  We'll definitely check that out!

I loved the sauce on my lasagna, and also that they didn't have one of those awful inch thick layers of ricotta in the lasagna.  There was just the appropriate amount.  Nom!"}
{"text":"Have been trying to get to Tutti Santi for some time. Well last night was the night. 
My only question to myself.... what the heck took us so long! 
This is by far one of the finest dining experiences my husband and I have ever had. ( and we are serious foodies)
We had the privilege of Debbie ( the owners daughter) to be our server. And I hate to say that because she was so much more. 
We started with a beautiful bottle of wine and the escargot. Wonderful... with the garlic bread they bring and fresh Parmesan on the table. 
Debbie told us about the specials. 
Well okay.... we want one of each. 
Veal Cannelloni with homemade gnocchi. And the Ciopinno . 
Watching the food come out and the smells.... oh this will be amazing. 
We each had a Caesar salad. Fresh and crisp.  Not overly dressed. 
Now onto the dinner. 
It has arrived. Devine. The homemade pasta and sauces were to die for. 
The seafood Ciopinno was loaded with salmon/mussels/clams/squid/scallops. Over fettuccine and a beautiful light red sauce. With all the seafood juices . 
Another bottle of wine a must!! 
This was delightful. 
What appears next is the tiramisu. Light... creamy... can't believe we ate the whole thing!! 
But wait there's more..... 
2 shots of Sambuca  with 3 coffee beans.. lit on fire. 
Perfect end to really one of the best restaurants in town. 
Thank you . Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Secretly hidden in a strip mall behind a McDonalds is one of the best Italian restaurants in the Phoenix / Scottsdale area. Extensive wine list, fresh fish entre' daily and a wonderful selection of traditional Italian dinner dishes. Wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. And, the original art work (paintings) throughout adds a big touch of class!"}
{"text":"The freshest pasta I think I have ever had. Cooked perfect al dente with smooth light flavors throughout the course. Excellent service. Jimmy is awesome. This my single and only recommendation for authentic Italian food. I literally reactivated my yelp account just to write this review."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding!!! My love ordered the pasta dish ( diavola) with calamari and mussels, which was so flavorful and spicy. The calamari was cooked to perfection and the mussels were big and tasty. I loved the sauce! I ordered the Chicken Della Casa, which had prosciutto, mushrooms, asparagus, and a side of penne rosa. We also ordered wine, tiramisu, a cannoli, and coffee. We were impressed on how great everything tasted. The Service was good. We normally take pictures of food but forgot and once we started eating we wanted more."}
{"text":"Ambiance was very nice. Service was really good. Very expensive which wasn't the worse part, the food was horrible. My husband just got chicken parmesan which so bland. The kids got basic spaghetti and hated it. They didn't like the taste.  I got some dish that had Angel Hair pasta, spinach and shrimp. Horrible!!!! The shrimp was horribly cooked and rubbery. Just not good food!!!"}
{"text":"After living in New York for 4 years, Italian food in Phoenix definitely pales in comparison. However, the food here was not what I had an issue with, the service was lack luster/borderline horrible. I call it my 3 hour tour, which ended instead of crashing into a foreign island, sipping a free shot of sambuca. My reservation was for 7 and I was seated almost immediately. I ordered my drink and waited a good 15 minutes before it arrived. Then I waited a close to 20 minutes before the next order of drinks arrived. This continued. Listen, I get that you are busy and it is Friday, I get it. But please have someone run drinks to their tables, a continuous flow of alcohol always keeps patrons happy, especially when the food is taking a long time. The waitress was slammed, had too many tables and VERY forgetful. If you want to spend 250 dollars, have great food and not great drinks or service, go here. Otherwise, I recommend you go to a restaurant that can accommodate you in all regards. That, or go here at a time when you are sure to miss the traffic. 

My comments on the food are as follows: 
-Antipasto for 2- Love, love, love! The plate is enough for 4, big portions and big flavors. 
-Gnocchi marinara-Love it! Little fluffy clouds of potato wonder. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Attire is not casual, was thinking twice about our decision when we arrived to find the location was in a strip mall. Place looks like a total dive. We had tried the location at 59th Ave and 101 and it was really nice, don't know why they closed it down and kept this location open instead. We had a 5:30 reservation and the hostess asked if I had another shirt, needless to say we were happy to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have never been led astray by yelp until now.
I wouldn't send anyone I know here, how it has 4.5 stars is baffling! 

The decor is probably 20-30 years old, which has its own charms and is passable for a traditional Italian restaurant. 

The biggest issue was our waiter Andreas, who looks like Ron Jeremy. He wouldn't take our order without making us ask four times as some sort of poor joke. Then he was shouting across the dining room to check that he had our order correct \"did you want the white wine sauce or the marinara?\"
He would toss silverware on the table in passing and remark \"everything okay?\" Without waiting for a response or caring.
I didn't want to ask for things that we needed for fear of him antagonizing us further. 

The second big issue: the food. We started with the mussles in white wine sauce, they were okay. The salad was super plain, one tomato slice, in store bought balsamic dressing. Not even worth eating. I got the penne pasta and it arrived with chunks of wilted romaine lettuce on it. My boyfriend got the veal in Marsala sauce that was flavorless boiled fatty veal. 

We each got a glass of wine which was good, on the warm side. Getting a bill for $90 for this extremely sub standard service and food was the final insult to this awful experience. 

If you're looking for good Italian food I recommend Tomasos or North."}
{"text":"Loved! Boyfriend took me here for Valentine's day, they were packed. I thought it would take forever to get our orders. The server was really friendly and the food came out wonderful. Would love to come back :)"}
{"text":"Rarely do I eat at a restaurant where I haven't a clue how to start making the dish; but Tutti knocked my socks off. I tried a shrimp dish with a white cognac sauce ... yeah ... cream and cognac ... I get it, but this was the lightest white sauce I've ever had. A perfect compliment to the shrimp ... just perfect. The wait staff was attentive, but didn't hover trying to turn the table. They assumed you were in for the night. A little on the pricey side ($140 for 3) but worth every penny."}
{"text":"If you are looking for genuine Italian food, this is your place. The pasta was tender, the sauce flavorful, and the creme brulee was smooth with just the right amount of crust. We ate everything that was put in front of us and that was no small feat as the portions were generous too! We tried the ravioli, gnocchi, calamari, and creme brulee and enjoyed every last bite. The only criticism is that the bar could use a simple cocktail program to keep up with the trendier restaurants. They have plenty of wine but just 3 or 4 premium cocktails would would send it past the tipping point. That didn't take away from our 5 star experience though. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the masseuses nearby gave us this place as a recommendation for dinner over the weekend. WOW was it delish! I got the Chicken Imperiale and my friend got the homemade ravioli. Both dishes were incredible. Our server Marco was lovely (anyone who calls me \"bella\" is :) ). 

Tutti Santi is tucked away in a corner in the small strip area at North 16th Street and Morten, near the Hilton Squaw Peak. I get my nails done in here and somehow had never noticed this quaint restaurant. 

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pasta!!  I actually dined at their new location on 90th and Via Linda (old Amarone's).  I was there with the wife, kids, and in-laws and every single one of our dishes was out of this world.  I had the osso buco special, which was rich and delicious.  My wife had the tortellini which was great.  Other peoples' orders included fettuccine, gnocchi, and penne (all great).  We also ordered their ravioli as an appetizer and it was some of the best ravs I've ever tried!  There are not too many restaurants where everyone at the table loved their food, but it was the case this time.  Not being from Arizona I am disappointed that  I will only be able to dine here the once or twice a year that I visit.  This has now become a go to place when visiting the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My new favorite Italian restaurant! Homemade authentic Italian food. So delicious! We had each of the specials, I had chicken in a tarragon & brandy cream sauce with mushrooms and linguine, and my other half had crab and shrimp stuffed ravioli with a saffron cream sauce. Both dishes were amazing and you can tell they were made from scratch!  We also had tiramasu for dessert which was also made there and equally as wonderful. I am so glad we decided to stop in and try this place last night!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal.  We made a reservation and unfortunately to wrong restaurant - but on a busy Friday night we were squeezed in.  So glad we were.  Our dinners were fantastic Chicken Parmesan and Pesto shrimp special.  It was so good we finished the rest Saturday night. The Service was spot on as well.  If your from he North East and are looking for a fantastic Itialian spot look no further.  tutti Santi your going to have a few more regulars!!!!"}
{"text":"I have no comments about this place i came here to eat dinner with my wife evrything was great from the service to the food i wish i could give them more stars"}
{"text":"I usually avoid chains, particularly Italian chains, like the plague.  However, it was my mother-in-law's birthday and this is her favorite place.  So we go.  And I was more than a little surprised (pleasantly).  

The good:

- Great for kids (if you get the table in the little room off the other room)
- Very friendly service
- The osso bucco was the 2nd best osso bucco I've ever had and I've had my fair share (a few bites weren't as tender as it should have been, but the mixture of savory fat, rice, butter, and marrow has me craving more)
- The ravioli was delicious  
- Did I mention that little room off to the side is great if you have little kids!

The bad:

- Can't think of anything"}
{"text":"We have eaten here perhaps a dozen times thru the past 4-5 years.

Sadly, the table cloth was not changed from the prior guest and was soiled. The bar drinks were not close to par and the service abysmal.

The food remains very good though drinks and main courses now overpriced.

Regrettably now removed from our list of great Scottsdal restaurants."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian food spot in town. The gnocchi and ravioli are incredible!"}
{"text":"Way to pricey for that quality of food. Our \"mixed greens salad\" only had lettuce and everyone got one tomatoe on top, one. The risotto was hard, so not cooked well enough. Nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Casual dining for Italian cravings. I appreciated the salad appetizer with fresh tasting vegetables and dressed lightly with a vinegarette. 

I ordered the Vitello francese which is veal scallopini with a side of penne pasta. I misread it, because I thought the veal would be served over a bed of penne pasta. Instead, it came with a side of penne pasta with a red sauce, which was just okay. 

I also pointed to a 7.00 glass of wine, but looking at the receipt, he charged me 9.00. Which wine he actually gave me, I am unsure.

Despite that, my entree was delicious, and had a pretty good experience overall"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!  It was my husbands birthday and we decided to order take-out since we have small children and it would be more difficult dining out then eating in.  So I called in to order the take out, first the man who took the order had no clue what was on the menu, he was rushing me when I was trying to ask information on some of the items and stated 25-30 minutes.  I had him repeat the order as well as when it would be ready to pick-up and he said 25-30 minutes again.  So I get there, he said its not ready it would be a few mor minutes, 20 minutes later I had to ask where my takeout order was he said it was coming.  Being it has been over an hour I am getting a bit anxious as I know my husband and children will be starving if I do not get back home.....So an HOUR later they come out with only HALF the order and proceed to say the rest is coming.  At this point I know I had to just get my husbands birthday dinner to him.  It has been an hour and a half, no apologies, no recognition whatsoever, and I say I will just take what I have and go could you please refund me the rest of the order, he responded NO just wait!!!   I should of left because as I tried to waiti the additional time I saw two cockaroaches scurry pass my feet by the bar!  WHAT!!!!!!!!!  I left and I will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"So my family and I came into town for a hockey tournament.  A good friend of mine highly recommended we come here to Tutti Santi for a dinner.    The first free night we were going to have was a Sunday night which happened to be Valentine's Day.

I called at 1030 that morning to try to make a 7o'clock reservation.  I spoke to Robbie (I hope I got that right).  We chatted for a good ten minutes, most of that time laughing.  Robbie was able to get us a table reservation for five at 7 PM. Yes, same day reservation for five on Valentine's Day; miracle worker.  Robbie said he wanted to meet my family and me when we got there that night.  I was hoping to meet him too but didn't expect to.

When we were seated, our server Vincent, greeted us by asking my youngest son if we were from the San Francisco bay area.  Clearly Robbie had taken notes during our phone call.  Then Robbie showed up at our table and introduced himself, embracing my wife with a hug and kissing her cheeks.  What a reception.  We felt so important and like we were family.

Our night just kept on getting better from there.  Vincent was so great.  He and my father were comparing their days in the military.  For a moment I thought he was gong to pull up a seat and have dinner with us.  So that was the customer service. We weren't actually customers, we were treated as family.

Now the food.  My friend recommended the veal so that's what I ordered.  No let down here, Superb!  My wife had the Cioppino which was a special for the night.  Keep in mind that we are from the SF Bay Area ( the literal home of Cioppino). This should be on the menu everyday it was so wonderful.  One of my sons asked for the raviolis minus the sauce.  He loved them and I swooped one for myself.  The cheese was so creamy.  My other boy had a huge plate of spaghetti which he gobbled up after a long day of hockey and swimming.  My father had the Gnocchi at Vincent's suggestion saying he was taking a chance on something he usually would not order.  My father is a very lite eater but his plate was clean when it was time to leave.

Cost; family of five, my wife and I both had beers with dinner (we are not wine drinkers).  Our bill was about $120 before tip.

Departing words: If you are in the area, I highly recommend you go here; you will not be disappointed.  Our experience was worth every penny and then some.  A warm welcome, a great meal, and great memories."}
{"text":"While visiting family in Prescott AZ, we drove into Scottsdale and had a fabulous dinner at TUTTI SANTI BY NINA. The restaurant is full of Italian charm, with a big menu of appetizers, pastas, and main dishes - and a very good selection of wines, beers and cocktails. For starters, my wife and I shared a Mozzarella Caprese (tomatoes, basil & mozzarella) - it was very tasty.  For entrees, my wife ordered a Rigatoni Pipitone (pasta in a creamy tomato vodka sauce with ground sirloin), and I ordered the Veal Scaloppini saut√©ed in a lemon butter white wine sauce with mushrooms, capers and artichoke hearts, along with a side of pasta.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious!  For dessert, we shared a mouth-watering Tiramisu. Service was excellent, and prices were reasonable for the fantastic food and ambience. We noticed several families with mature adolescents, but none with very young children. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the way a restaurant should be. Very fresh and light.  Seriously the best Italian food we've ever had.  Great service, great food."}
{"text":"Fabulous authentic Italian cuisine in a loving Italian environment! Delicious food and impeccable service that makes you feel like family hugging you! Viva Italia!Bravo Tutti Santi!"}
{"text":"From the pastoral wall mural and the wine bottles lining the shelves to the vintage ad posters, Tutti Santi is exactly what you envision when you think EYE-TAL-YON. And by that, I mean the decor is a little cliched.

What isn't cliched are the authentic homemade pastas and attentive service.

Without a reservation, we were greeted and sat immediately on a Saturday night. The server told us a bit about the place and seemed near bursting with pride as he described the house specialties. I almost expected him to bring his fingers to his mouth and make an exaggerated smacking kiss. He didn't, but that would have been awesome.

We started out with salad greens and cream of asparagus soup, both were simple and flavorful. The gnocchi and ricotta spinach ravioli that everyone on here is raving about? The best I've ever had. We couldn't decide between the two, so our server offered to do half and half- brilliant.

We also had the special of the night, Veal Oscar (veal cutlets in a Marsala sauce topped with fontina, asparagus, and crab meat), with a side of penne pomodoro. The pasta outshined the veal for me, but I thoroughly enjoyed both dishes. The portions are on the generous side and left us unable to even contemplate dessert- still we left with enough leftovers for an entire meal.

I'm not sure when I'll be back, it's a bit pricey for a casual dinner (for my pocketbook), and the ambiance was a little too lacking to make it a special \"date night\" spot. I do know I'm going to be thinking about those ravioli for a long time, though."}
{"text":"We ate here during a stay at the Hilton Squaw Peak (posted a review for our horrible stay there but I digress)... The BEST part of our stay in Phoenix was this restaurant. Service was on point. Food was AMAZING... I'm a Brooklynite -- born and raised (not a transplant who lived there for 5 years and says I'm a Brooklynite... a real born and bred Brooklynite!) and grew up eating really really good Italian food, not to mention I can throw down in the kitchen when it comes to Italian food --  so I'm really picky when it comes to Italian food... This place served up some DELICIOUS stuff.  And -- the best part -- they have tartfuo dessert! Go here -- eat here!"}
{"text":"A marvelous little place tucked into an older strip mall. It feels like a little slice of Italy. 

Vincent was our waiter and took good care of us... And yes. He looks like Al Pacino and purportedly attended acting classes with the real Al along with DeNiro in the 60's. 

The Escargot and dinner salad were good but the best of the night was a Veal Francese. Tender and in a wonderfully prepared sauce of white wine, butter and capers. The Eggplant Parmesan was delicious as was the Cannoli for dessert. Excellent all the way around. It's a small place and can get intimate really fast if you have loud neighbors. Great choice and worth a visit when your looking for baci di dama."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic but what really stood out to me was the service. From Lucky the bar tender to our waitress Gildra (I know I butchered that sorry!) everything was incredible. They were personable, attentive, and friendly. They really made you feel like a part of the family there. I loved it. One of the best dining experiences that I've had since moving to Scottsdale. I particularly recommend the Ravioli De Nina. So good! The wine was excellent as well."}
{"text":"This is weird. All the Tutti Santis are the same. Yet, the other one has 4 stars and this has 2? Don't understand and it made me skeptical to try it, but I had a restaurant.com gift card and it was too late. Plus, my bf wanted some Italian food. I personally don't like the American Italian food that isn't authentic, but rather creamy and fattening. Well we went on a Friday night and it was full. They still sat us in 15 minutes, but didn't take our orders for another 15. I was happy though as the most delicious herb bread and butter came out hot onto our table. We started with the caprese salad and the ravioli. There were 4 pieces of ravioli and 4 servings of the caprese. The prices are a little high for Italian food as the ravioli cost $10 (remember there were 4 pieces) and the caprese was $12. It was good though. For the entree I got the spaghetti bolognese and my bf got this pasta with a ton of vegetables and chicken. The entrees come with a salad that consists of romaine and a slice of tomato. The service was good even though they are incredibly busy. I loved how it was authentic Italian. They even spoke to you in Italian and made it very comfortable. The major downer came at the end. The waiter brought us the check and pointed the the % of tip that he recommends. He said he didn't add it in there, we can do that (well duh), but he still recommends this one. I do not appreciate people telling me how to tip. I can decide for myself. That left a sour taste in my mouth. Overall, the food was good though pricey for Italian."}
{"text":"I must admit, I had my doubts about this place. I went because it was my classmate's surprise 25th birthday so I even debated on ordering anything. I did however enjoy the place! They serve unlimited bread and it is delicious with olive oil. One of the girls at dinner is a bread-fanatic. She will only eat good bread, and our side of the table ordered 3 rounds of bread bowls! I ate the homemade ravioli and that was also delicious. The sauce was a mix between Alfredo and tomato sauce. I did enjoy the place and if i didn't drive, I would have tried their wine also. Kudos to this place!"}
{"text":"This is a good neighborhood traditional Italian restaurant. The food has been great and consistent. Nice ambience with fun Dean Martin standard music. But the last few times, we've had a \"crabby New Yorker\" type as a server (my family is from New York, so I feel OK making that generalization) who is not particularly helpful with any questions we ask him, condescending and rude even.  While that might work at a hotdog cart in Manhattan, it doesn't work for me. I think we deserve better given that our meal was over  $75, and that is without wine.   We like the food here but this time we thought we might not come back due to the attitude of the server.  If we had a nice server, I would definitely give Tutti Santi 5 stars."}
{"text":"Our favorite Italian restaurant in Az and maybe our overall favorite place of all varieties.  The food, service and ambiance reminds me of our special NY places that locals go to.
We are always greeted with a big welcome and seated in the lounge which we prefer.  The menu covers all the bases and it is hard to pick a dish that is not Italian perfection.  All meals come with a complementary soup or salad. When is the last time you have seen that?
All of this comes with extremely reasonable prices.
Go, I guarantee you will be happy."}
{"text":"cant go wrong with this place excellent service and food, I live in San Francisco and they have great restaurants there, This place is on par with any Italian joint in SF."}
{"text":"Amazing experience from start to finish! In town for work and staying at the nearby Hilton and had a craving for Italian. This place is very close and had good reviews so we gave it a try. The restaurant was not crowded or loud, was nice to be able to chat and hear the conversation without screaming over the table. Large selection of wines (both white and red) for reasonable prices. Had the mozzarella capresse. I'm a picky eater and was unsure but my coworker ordered it so I had to try. It was really good. A great light appetizer. They was no soup option, so we got the salads. Again, delicious,  light but flavorful. There was grated cheese on the table and I enjoyed that on top. I ordered the gnocchi because the reviews were so good and my colleague got the veil parmasean. I was worried if the gnocchi would be filling since it had no meat and Debra assured me it would be. She was SO right! I was so satiated once I finished my plate. The white sauce with a hint of the sweet red sauce had me savoring (& scraping my plate) with each bite. The gnocchi were the perfect texture, I may order again before I head back home (don't judge). My colleague enjoyed the veil dish, it wasn't too heavy and drowned in sauce. There was a good crispy coating and felt \"very authentic\". I agree 100%. The moment we walked in and smelled garlic, we were sold. The great service by Debra and the amazing amazing food definitely deserve 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I must say this is the best Italian food I have tried since I went to New York City. The staff was very friendly and the orders were always made fresh to order. My daughter is a picky eater and she devoured the salad and well as the fresh mozzarella. The waiter was very friendly and had a bubbly and warm personality. This place is great for a date as well as anniversary. Will definitely come back to this place for good food and a happy vibe"}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place and decided to try it with my husband for dinner. The food was GREAT! The Orange Roughy and the Veal was what we ordered for Entree...excellent! The Creme Brulee was to dye for! It may have looked like a mall restaurant from the outside but once you step in, it is cosy and nice. Plan on hosting a corporate dinner there! Must try in Scottsdale if you like Italian."}
{"text":"Guy, our waiter, was patient and kind.  Took all our requests in stride.  Best ravioli I have ever had.   Seriously the best.

Spaghetti was great, chicken parm and Alfredo great!

Gotta go see these folks!  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Delightful and charming atmosphere tucked in the kierland area ( Scottsdale) area.

Four course meal was exceptional with homemade mozzarella, salads with delicious house dressing,  the signature ravioli and Lasagna di Nina and traditional Italian deserts. On a personal note the ravioli was so delicate and light it melted in my mouth, so full of flavor. Appropriate wine list to compliment the menu selection. 

Portions are suitable and the prices are modest in comparison to the fantastic quality.

A lovely family owned restaurant in the heart of Phoenix worth multiple visits. Traditional European dining experience. 

Impossible to find an equivalent quality Italian restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"Everything and everyone is amazing here!! Tres was our server with excellent recommendations and loved the final sambuca treat as well!! Robbie topped my night off with my special \"VIP\" card! I loved the fettuccine Monte mare with shrimp so much, that I had to have it again the next day.  Thank you so much, we will definitely visit here often!"}
{"text":"I try and post something positive for every negative that I put out there so here it is!!!! 
We have been going here for years and don't know why I have never reviewed it. Family owned and operated. I have never had anything but exceptional food here. Sit at the bar and be treated by Mateo's attention to service.  Everything is amazing! 
Known for ravioli but we love the bruschetta, cannelloni, Bolognese and chicken Nina!  This place is in a strip mall but don't let that fool you.  Once you walk in the elegant family atmosphere envelopes you.  Superb!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great smell of Italian cuisine, friendly service, good cocktails, good menu and of course great food."}
{"text":"My second time at this location and another 5 star experience!

Both times I've come here with my uncle (who knows the owner, so maybe my experiences here are bit bias ) and we've been treated superb.. Never an empty water or wine glass, fresh warm bread right away, informative and detailed recommendations from the waiter, and last but not least .. Amazing Italian food!

I've ordered the salmon and risotto dish twice because it's simple and so fulfilling! Smokey and moist salmon paired with melt in your mouth risotto, topped with two pieces of grilled asparagus. 

It is a bit hidden within a shopping plaza, but the inside is nice, dimly lit, and has a wealth of character. 

Excited to (and needing to) try out some different dishes next time we're in the area. Would also be curious to see if we would have similar treatment without my uncle."}
{"text":"My lord. The food here has got to be the best I have ever had. To start, the bread was to die for and to kill for. So crispy yet not burned, each bite melted in ny mouth. Their Lasagna was so perfect and flavorful. The tender Lasagna topped with a mozzarella so perfect words cannot describe could easily be called the crown jewel of this restaurant. The spinach stuffed ravioli was second to none. Each bite was a teip to heaven in a buick le sabre driven by God himself. The service was easily the best I've ever had, anywhere. The waiter was hilarious and a other staff was friendly and helpful. Before we left I believeit was Mama Santi walked me out and pinched my cheekies! I am absolutely in love with this restaurant and highly recommend that if you live in or are visiting Phoenix, you must visit. This restaurant really does make you feel like family."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY overpriced. $21-23 per plate. Tiny portion sizes.

The food quality is OK, about on par with Olive Garden if you are into that type of quality.

They touted fresh made pastas when we entered. When we ordered the Spagetti side dish was definitely not fresh made. The Canneloni was. 

The Escargot which was highly spoken up by the owner was absolutely horrible. Definitely had been reheated and rather than swimming in butter it was swimming in a luke warm lemon water with spinach. GROSS!!!!

Service was average. Nice enough staff. The plates at this place should be $8-14 at most. They are dreaming thinking they can keep charging these prices with the tiny little portion sizes they offer."}
{"text":"We are so happy that we found this place.  Reminds me of my favorite Italian restaurants in Brooklyn and  New Jersey. Food was amazing and the service was outstanding. We will return."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's hard to find authentic family style Italian food in Arizona, but this one hits the right spots. My parents visited and it satisfied my Italian mother who generally only accepts Italian food made by my grandmother."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale on business, Yelp directed us to this little Italian restaraunt down the road from our resort. Both the food and service were a treat. Great meal. - 6/28/2009"}
{"text":"Not a memorable experience. The server asked salad or soup. Soup was Italian wedding. Was. I ordered it and they ran out. They also never mentioned lemoncello gelato but said they had almond gelato. Then they came back and said no almond gelato but now they have lemoncello. Our server left half way through without telling us and we couldn't pay the bill fast enough because our replacement server was walking around hugging people. Hey also brought an extra coffee and charged for it even though we did not order it. Two stars because the food was good, but the entire experience was awful. If you go here, you're better off getting your food to go. The ravioli is awesome. But get it to go, unless you enjoy being disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently enjoyed dinner here with some friends who rave about this place. We were not disappointed. As soon as you walk through the door, you feel like you are in an old Italian restaurant. White table cloths and authentic decor. The staff was very friendly and attentive. They have a number of signature dishes. I had the Eggplant Parmesan, and it was excellent. My wife had the Rigatoni Pipitoni, which is pasta in a creamy vodka tomato sauce with ground beef. It was outstanding as well. Our friends had the Trio di Pasta, three pastas as the name suggests in a Gorgonzola sauce, and Veal Cannelloni. Both looked delicious. All entrees are served with salad or soup at very modest prices. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Way to ruin Valentine's Day. 

2 hour wait for people with reservations???? Seriously. 

You owe your customers much more than a half a** apology. 

I was really looking forward to this dinner I made reservations a week ago. 

The saddest part was the family of 6 waiting outside with kids that was told they too were going to wait over an hour as well. 

Shame on you tutti Santi"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sat there for almost 2 hrs saw waiter 3x and took an hour to get our soups and salads.  Would not go back bc of service.  Table was never cleaned off from drinks and water never refilled"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was under-whelmed. The ambience of the restaurant was old world Italian and kind of interesting. But, someone needs to get in there with a high powered vacuum and get the caked on dirt off the heavy curtains hung around the dining room. Yuck!

On arrival I mentioned that I'd dined at the other Valley location. I was told they were both family run. But, separately. And, that this location was the original and \"the best.\" Bravo for the confidence of the hostess - perhaps she is family.

Well, I kind of remember having a really good experience at the north Phoenix location which is what brought me here. But, that was years ago with friends and I was probably paying more attention to friends than the meal at that time.

Here, we arrived late. Play off baseball was on the TV in the bar. So, too, were all the staff. The server was polite and friendly. But, more interested in the game. Service in the near empty dining room was slower than made sense.

The pollo caprese was not worth a to-go box for the 50% left uneaten. The lasagna bolognese wasn't impressive though acceptable in quantity for the price.

Willing to give the other location another try. This one is a no-go for me."}
{"text":"How different can two Valley locations of the same - family operated - restaurant be? Very!

Come to this location and give the north-central Phoenix location a pass.

First off, this location is clean! No caked on dirt clinging to curtains that appear centuries old in the Phoenix location.

Nice people in both locations.

The quality of the meals here - Lasagna Il Forno and veal canaloni were both far superior to the meals had in the other location. It seems the pricing here is a bit better, too. But, perhaps that is just bias because of being much happier here than there. Very interesting mushroom soup. 

I know that bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar is not \"a thing\" in Italy. But, it's a nice touch. This location served it. The other did not.

The chocolate mousse cake was a bit dry. The creme brulee was nicely done. Both, at $9, are over-priced.

Happy to have my faith in this place restored. Definitely a \"be back\" for this location and will gladly pass the other one by forever more."}
{"text":"I went for dinner last night with a group of friends, and it was such a wonderful experience!  There were four of us, and we split the ravioli appetizer, which is their signature dish.  We also had the stuffed mushrooms, and the special for the night (burrata).  Everything was spectacular!  The ravioli had a wonderful sauce and richness to it, and it is easy to understand why this is their signature dish.

For dinner, I had the tortellini and it was very delicious. The sauce that came with it was rich and wonderful, and the pieces of ham were a good size.  

One of my friends ordered the gnocchi, which had the same sauce that came with the ravioli.

For dessert, we had the cannolis.  One of my friends wanted vanilla ice cream, and they were able to bring it out for her despite it not being on the menu.

Overall, it was a great experience, and we enjoyed ourselves for 3.5 hours catching up and eating great food!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  This is amazing... my new favorite place.  

I went with my mom, brother and his wife to celebrate my sister-in-law's birthday.

My mom had been raving about the ravioli and she was right - they are amazing!! 

I had looked at the menu and was torn between ordering the homemade ravioli (cheese & spinach filling) with a cream/tomato sauce or the homemade gnocchi with the same cream/tomato sauce.  So, I convinced the table to order the gnocchi appetizer (a small version of the gnocchi dinner).  It was amazing!!!  The best gnocchi I've ever had.  Really light and melts in your mouth.  And the cream and tomato sauce is really fresh and creamy at the same time.

The garlic bread that comes with the dinners is good - even better dipped in olive oil and balsamic (which they will bring you if you ask).

The dinners all come with either soup or salad.  I had read on Yelp that the soups were really good.  So, my mom and I got their soup of the day - a cream of vegetable soup - cauliflower, brocolli, carrots, potato.....  Really, creamy and flavorful and light - it was amazing!!!!  My brother and his wife both got the salads.  They both ate them but said they were just so-so.  Nothing special.  They should have gotten the soup!

Then, we all ordered the ravioli except for my brother who must have loved the gnocchi as much as I did and he got that.  We were all suprised he didn't go for a meat dish - he's usually a pretty big eater.  

The ravioli were just like the gnocchi - light and just perfect - in a cream and tomato sauce.  

For dessert, my sister-in-law picked the creme brulee.  It was a good size, with sliced strawberries on top.  Our waiter brought it out with a candle on top and it ended up being free (nice touch from the restaurant).  It was very good. 

And the little shots of flaming sambuca (black licorice flavored liquor) at the end is a nice and fun touch, too.

The service was excellent as well.  

The atmosphere is fine - very cozy, dim lighting and traditional with white table cloths, etc.  The decor is a pretty outdated but I've seen worse.  It wouldn't deter me from coming back.  But, I would probably go even more if it was updated.

I'm so excited to have found it - my new favorite Italian place - and really reasonable prices, too."}
{"text":"I came to this location a few times. Once in 2010 and just recently a few days ago. My hubby and I shared the fresh mozzarella appetizer and immediately were impressed. The cheese just melted in our mouths. 
I ordered the Tutti Santi pasta Trio and he ordered the lamb chop. With every bite the plates got even more flavorful. There was not one morsel left and I was ready to lick the plate clean (but didn't).

Even though we do not live close by, we will definitely be making the drive to this location more often than we would like to get our Italian fix."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place at first, but after having the food I was a fan.  The service was very good and the food was outstanding.  I will be back soon.  Grazie Tante!!"}
{"text":"Very food and very service. They do a good job for the price of a meal. Nice pour for wine and drinks. Nice place to dine at."}
{"text":"Could have been 5 stars but wait for food was long waiter did say sorry and didn't lie, kitchen lost ticket, now food the veal parmigiana was amazing real authentic it's been 3 years since I've been here and food was still spot on good."}
{"text":"This is what Italian restaurants in the valley should aspire to be. Tutti Santi, You had me at first bite. That perfect bite of al dente spaghetti noodles with a rich sauce. Some restaurants fail to capture this simple concept but not here. 

There wasn't a disappointed member at my table. We had a a couple items from the menu; Lasagna, bolognese, vasuviani, the sampler-all were a hit. 

The service was sincere and not a single member of the staff failed to greet us and they all ensured a great dining experience. 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very delicious Italian food. I had the Veal Francese, and the sauce was so good that I dumped my already deliciously seasoned side of roasted carrots and zucchini onto my plate, so I could soak up every last drop of it. My only complaint was that we were one of the only tables there....pretty empty, so not much atmosphere. Too bad, since the food was so good."}
{"text":"This place is right next to our house so my wife and I were very hopeful that we would have an enjoyable experience. Such was not to be. I should probably mention that we used a Groupon that had been offered two days prior so it is possible that they were simply overwhelmed.

Service: We waited for 10 minutes before our drink orders were taken. The server was so unfriendly that it actually made us uncomfortable. I believe that there was one server for about 9 tables which is probably why she was so grumpy. When we received the check she had circled the portion of the check that showed the 20% tip. I was annoyed by this, but I can understand that they don't want to get ripped on the lower check price (due to the Groupon). But then when I got my credit card receipt SHE HAD PREFILLED THE TIP AT 20%!!! This was just ridiculous. Out of principle alone, I scribbled it out and entered 15%. Now I'll have to check with my credit card company to make sure that they don't mess with the total.

Food:  I got a cream-based chicken meal with asparagus. The chicken was way overdone and the sauce was a bit bland. My wife got the Chicken Imperiale. The flavor was actually pretty good, but once again the chicken was WAY overcooked. 

Conclusion: I would have recommended that people wait for them to get their act together, but the issue with the check was just too much for me. I would stay away from here- there are much better options available and you won't have to check your credit card statement to make sure the server didn't \"adjust\" the tip."}
{"text":"Me and the girlfriend stopped by on a Sunday night. I noticed that the restaurant had just changed names(ownership) So I thought we would check it out. 

We went around 8:15 on a Sunday night so there was not that many people there. The quality of service was excellent. Usually most places at this time are a little pissed you are there. 

The bread they offered was extremely tasty with a garlic butter. 

The garlic noodles I got were extremely tasty, they had a lot of flavor for having a butter sauce. 

I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Holy cow. This place has glorious tasting food and the service was very quirky and top notch.  

My hubby and I went here for the first time to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  I was excited after reading all the reviews and went in knowing we \"had\" to try the gnocchi.  I've had gnocchi a few times in my life and it was ok...nothing to write home about.

We arrive and the place was cram packed, busy.  We had an open table reservation so we didn't have to wait.  We were seated in a little room, off the main dining room, that had a few tables in it.  It was nice to be off to the side in a more quiet area so my hubby and I could talk and feel more \"secluded\".  

Our server was Trace and he was a hoot.  So dang quirky that it was totally odd at first.  I had never experienced server personalities that were were as if you were their buddy and in their house.  The first moment it started was when my hubby asked Trace about their beer selection.  Upon listing a good lineup of their beers my husband decided to hold off and not order one. Trace threw his hands up and said \"Damnit!\" as he went to grab our menus (after we ordered our meals). lol.  I was very confused and thought, \"that is pretty....unprofessional...\" I then began to think that I had remembered tons of yelpers raved about the service as well and figured this \"culture\" was so unique, like the food, that it just added to the greatness about this place.  Trace had come back into the room to care for a few more tables and I just really realized that was truly his server essence and I quickly fell in love with it.  He kept all of his customers smiling and laughing.  He was a total kid when it came to his customers.  He cracked semi-sarcastic jokes about my husband to me and vice versa.  Nothing brash...it as all in great taste.  He was awesome.

The same can be said about the bartender.  He was sent over to give a more extensive list of beers that they offered that Trace wasn't/coulnd't rattle off automatically.  Even the bartender as totally quirky and I really realized from then on that THAT'S just how it is there.  It feels like FAMILY in there.

Got the gnocchi app and holy friggen cow.  Everyone is/was RIGHT.  Uh-may-zing! Their garlic bread was good.  Great balance of butter and garlic on it.  I got the split pea soup and my husband the garden salad.  The soup I liked and my husband thought the garden salad was \"ok\".  

For the main courses, I ordered the orange roughy w/ pasta dish.  When the plate arrived I was in love with the size of the fish!  It was HUGE.  Upon first bite I instantly felt like I was eating an omelette.  I took a few more bites and wasn't happy.  All I could taste was fried egg and no fish.  Trace came to check on us and I asked him if the fish was coated in egg then pan fried.  He told me they do a light egg wash on the fish before cooking.  I told him all I could taste was egg and I was bummed because I absolutely love orange roughy.  He gladly brought me a menu to order something else.  I tried ordering the ravioli but they had ran out.  Bummer.  I then ordered the tortellini and was very happy with that dish.

Husband got the veal parm and he liked it quite a bit.  I had a bite and it was good.  

All of their food tasted very fresh and the textures were spot on.  I can't wait to return to this place soon.  It's a 40 min drive from my area to the restaurant but it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Italian in the entire valley. It's a quaint place with really nice atmosphere and friendly staff. The food is where it really shines. I can't say enough about it. The Pasta di Trio and Lasagna are amazing! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. It is a bit pricey however."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dining establishments.   Small, intimate setting.   Reservations are recommended as we had a party of six.   We got seated on a timely manner and our server, Michael, was on point.  Very efficient considering they were really busy for a Wednesday night.   We were served the warm garlic bread right away and 
started our meal with a bottle of Chianti and Stuffed Mushroom appetizer which was tasty.   
All of the entries- Eggplant Parmigiana, Chicken Imperiale, Penne Della Casa, Linguine with Fresh Clams, Linguine del Marinaio, and I had the Chicken Marsala special- were ALL fantastic, perfectly seasoned.  
To compliment our meal, with coffee, we tried the Tiramisu, Cannoli, Creme Br√ªl√©e, Spumoni Ice Cream and Chocolate Cheesecake - FABULOUS.   We just about licked our plates.    
DEFINITE MUST VISIT TUTTI SANTI for a delicious dining experience!!"}
{"text":"This place is ok but not worth all the hype.  I've eaten here a couple of times and been consistently underwhelmed.  The food is ok but not anything to write home about and the service is a little on the arrogant side."}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD!!! My first time here and I'll definitely be back I got the spaghetti romantica with shrimp....my life might be changed forever tbh"}
{"text":"I had wanted to try Tutti Santi for a long time, and am very glad we got to try it tonight.  We shared the gnocchi and the fettuccine mare.  Both were exceptional!  The sauce on the fettuccine was rich, and I'm glad we were sharing it, but it was delicious.  The service was excellent, and the ambiance was nice as well.  The house salad was good but aesthetically has room for improvement.  The garlic bread was very good as well!  Hope to get to go back again!"}
{"text":"We had a large party at Tutti Santi, in the dining room which was to the right upon entering. We had the room to ourselves. Our server was friendly and efficient. He handled the large group with ease and kept us stocked with beverages throughout the meal. This alone made the night a great experience since dining with a large group can often become painful if the staff are not able to handle it. 

As for the food, it received the satisfaction of both the carnivores and the vegetarians in the party. I wouldn't say it was amazing, but it was good, solid Italian food. We ordered a variety of appetizers - by far the best was the grilled calamari. For entrees, most people had some variation of eggplant Parmesan or meat with pasta on the side. I tried the mixed seafood in a white wine and butter sauce. It was great and satisfied my desire to avoid spaghetti. 

For dessert, we just ordered platters of an assortment of desserts. With dessert, our server sang an excellent rendition of happy birthday, which simultaneously embarrassed and delighted the birthday person. The tiramisu was the favorite of the group by far, but the items were all quite good. I might skip the meal and go straight for dessert so that I have room for it. 

Overall, our dinner at Tutti Santi was a good experience for our large party, thanks to the quick service and attention from our server. The food wasn't my favorite but given the satisfaction of most people, which is hard to do in a group, we will probably be back."}
{"text":"I love this place -- very romantic and great food. I had to laugh at janette e.'s review --- \"Titti Santi?\"


LOL!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 13 to celebrate my daughters graduation from ASU and could not have chosen a better place!  The food was absolutely delicious.  The minute we walked in the door we felt like we were welcomed into the \"Tutti Santi\" family.  We had impeccable service throughout the meal with our server and Robbie continued that wonderful customer service and welcoming our group by entertaining our 12yr old with some special magic tricks.  He's amazing and our celebration was made so special because of Robbie and the staff.  If this place can impress college students, a grandma (who's bringing all her sun city friends back!), 2 teens and the adults, you know this place has all the right components going for it!  Amazing job Tutti Santi! We will be back each time we visit the Valley!  You are the best Robbie and staff!"}
{"text":"This restaurant gets 5 stars!!!  

We went here for Father's Day, and I wasn't sure what to think at first.  I looked over the menu before we went so I could decide what to get.  

After getting to Tutti Santi (cute, quaint, family owned place) I was excited to sit down and eat.  They had some specials, so we got some ravioli appetizer and bread, and it was amazing, everyone had seconds! 

Our salads came out promptly with delicious dressing and fresh lettuce and vegetables.  

We waited a bit for our entrees, but we werent even really worried about it, and then the manager came out to apologize for the delay, and about 10 minutes later our food arrived.  I got Chicken fiorentina, which was lightly breaded chicken with a white cream sauce and sauteed spinach.  OMG, it was the best thing I have tasted!!!!

When we were all finished, the manager came out with a complimentary slice of cheesecake for the delay and offered my dad a shot of sambuca.  

Great service, fun atmosphere and I will definitely be back to enjoy another one of their delicious meals."}
{"text":"What a fun place to go for Italian food on a Friday night!

So I checked out Tutti Santi with my aunts, uncles, cousins and other relatives, there were more than twelve of us, and I was expecting the service to be a little bit slower because our party was big but instead we received excellent service. Everyone ordered very different options from the menu, my cousin ordered the chicken special, and we were all very happy with our meals. 

And we were consistently checked up on by the waiters, our glasses were always full, and we left stuffed from the pasta. 

And their spaghetti and meat sauce was delicious! My favorite!"}
{"text":"Took my dad here for his birthday and OMG, so good!!My lord. The food here has got to be the best I have ever had. To start, the bread was to die for and to kill for. So crispy yet not burned, each bite melted in ny mouth. Their Lasagna was so perfect and flavorful. The tender Lasagna topped with a mozzarella so perfect words cannot describe could easily be called the crown jewel of this restaurant. The spinach stuffed ravioli was second to none. Each bite was a party that started in my mouth and ended in my belly! The service was easily the best I've ever had, anywhere. The waiter was hilarious and a other staff was friendly and helpful. We got sent on the house Sambucas (which my dad loves) and tiramisu for his birthday. I am absolutely in love with this restaurant and highly recommend that if you live in or are visiting Phoenix, you must visit. This restaurant really does make you feel like family."}
{"text":"Nice meal here.  My lobster ravioli was extremely rich (not surprising), but I managed to force myself through it.  Good appetizers and salad, and a reasonable tiramisu.  Nice, neighborhood place."}
{"text":"We like Tutti Santi a lot.  It's in our neighborhood and we normally order for take-out.  Their food is really quite good.  We have tried a number of different entrees and everything has been really consistent quality.  Although I frequently see older children there (above 8 years old), I wouldn't recommend eating-in with small children because it's a bit of a quite and more intimate setting for small kids who could get restless.  But the food is great and they happily do take-out!"}
{"text":"Exceptional meals. We had lasagna, mussels & calamari, and tagatini dish. We loved them all. Service was friendly and helpful. Reservations highly recommended. The restaurant was full on Monday night."}
{"text":"Food excellent, entrees large enough to share, don't skip the desserts, Staff also very friendly and tentative.  Only thing I wish they would have catered the conference we had at the Hilton, it would have been a much better week."}
{"text":"Walk ins NOT welcomed. Decided to try a new restaurant for an early meal one afternoon at 5:30pm.  The place was 90% empty. Rude welcome from front staff.  Hushed conversations and looks my way while the hostess decided if and where they could seat me. Uncomfortable meal as I was made to feel I totally destroyed their yet to come reservations.   Food overpriced.  The salad was laughable. The pasta bolognese very good, service average.  Drinks not refilled.  When I finished the place still essentially empty.   Obviously they depend on regulars and guard their reservations, probably expecting only one table turnover during 6:30-8:30 and don't have interest in new patrons.   Will not be back.   There are much better and less expensive Italian places to eat."}
{"text":"This place the girlfriend likes because of the Tiramisu.   We arrived, weren't very hungry anticipating desert, but ordered a main course anyway.  The Chicken Sausage Ravioli was overly salty, and the waiter openly balked our request to split a plate - - - after ordering two glasses of wine for $28.  I found this rude.  The waiter was overly attentive to the only other table in the place, yet ignored our table.  I had to get up and ask for the check while the waiter took a cell phone call outside.  I thought maybe I just had a bad day, but the girlfriend commented on waiter's attitude before I had mentioned it.  Not the type of service I'd expect for a $92 dollar check.  I'll  order takeout Tiramisu from here from now on.  Oddly the temperature in the dining room seems high (over 80+ degrees)."}
{"text":"Great, seemingly family-owned, traditional Italian restaurant tucked away in a strip mall right across the street from the Hilton Pointe Squaw Peak resort.

I had a frisson when they seemed surprised I was willing to sit with my back to the door in this old-school Italian place that had kind of New York vibe to it. Once we worked through that and settled into a nice glass of Chianti we were off and running.

Nice traditional (Southern) Italian menu including items like stuffed mushrooms, carpaccio, and tomato/mozzarella for starters as well as old standby's like lasagna, linguine with clams, and veal parmigiana for the mains.  On top of the menu (which is more diverse than I'm describing) they offered nice specials as well.

I had the carpaccio of beef (very good) followed by the veal parmigiana (outstanding).  The entree came with garlic bread (fresh and very good) and a side salad (less fresh and not as good).  

The ambiance is fun, casual, and a bit noisy if you're in the small, low-ceiling room next to the entrance on the right.  

They finished me off with a free sambuca with coffee beans in it, one representing the past, present, and future.  (Along with special instructions to leave the past behind.)

While the food was perfectly good, I knocked it up a full rating point for the attentive, friendly, and warm service."}
{"text":"First time i had been here, but it's my father in laws favorite place.  I had veal parmigina which isn't even on the menu, but he was happy to make it for me.  I also ordered the calamari fritta (be sure as they have many calamari dishes)......awesome.  I found it to be tender and not like a mouth full of elastics.  good local find."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, but never left a review..and I'm not sure why, as I love this place. So..let's fix that. Tutti Santi is one of my favorite places to dine in Phx. Tonight I brought a party of five close friends to this restaurant; none had ever been there prior. Long story short: food was outstanding as usual, service was great and my friends thought it was some of the best Italian food they've had. When you recommend a place to meet up with friends, you're vouching for the quality based on past experience. There's also that nagging concern that you might catch them on an \"off\" night and end up explaining to your friends that it's usually better than this....well, none of that tonight. Tutti Santi was perfect and my friends enjoyed everything about it. By the way, try the Linguine del Marinaio (seafood pasta dish). It's ridiculously good!!"}
{"text":"Holy ravioli is all I have to say....AMAZING! I'm an Italian girl from Jersey....I've had my fair share of ravioli in my life and this is the best I've ever had. Their green salad is really good too - simple and good. No iceberg lettuce here. Service is great. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because last time we were in, I tried a chicken dish that was just OK. Next time, I will just stick to the ravioli..."}
{"text":"What a marvelous venue for a Valentine's Day dinner....or any other day for that matter.
   
     Though the restaurant itself is relatively small in terms of physical space, it's enormous in terms of friendly, efficient servers. Tutti Santi produces probably the finest Italian cuisine in the Valley...quite probably in the entire region.

      I sampled the nightly special on that special night..a veal cannelloni. It was a revelation compared to the numerous other fine Italian restaurants in the Valley. It's obvious that the food quality and preparation are the main focus here and the execution is wonderfully successful.

       Love-of-my-life had a scrumptious Chicken Marsala and declared it equal to that of that presented at the Ristorante La Pergola in Rome...the three Michelin Star gastronomic heaven we were privileged to dine at while visiting Roma last fall.

        Kudos to the kitchen staff from the Chef on down...because they have much to be proud of.

        This place is definitively on the 'keepers' list."}
{"text":"Outside: Unassuming.
inside: The best damn Italian food in the valley. 

We typically call in to take home rather than dine in just because we live around the corner. But the warm, at home atmosphere makes it comforting to have a glass of wine at the bar while we wait for our take out order. 
Start off with the Mozzarella Caprese and Gnocchi app, then for dinner the Rigatoni Pipitone. Can't wait to try the Ravioli, they keep telling me to try. We come back again and again. The food is heavenly and pure. Deserves all five stars and then some."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, food and drinks! Debbie treated us as we were dining in her home with the most delicious Italian foods and wines! Love this place...our only regret is that we hadn't tried this place sooner! This is definitely our new go to for Italian!"}
{"text":"You have to let be the food at Titti Santi!! Have been going there for 20 years!! Started as special occasions turned into the best place to go for Italian food!!! Food- staff--Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and isn't real Italian. I was shocked by all the 4 and 5 star reviews of Sutti Santi. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food.  I had the homemade ravioli, really good. Boyfriend had the grlic pasta, lots of flavor.  The canoli was so good we got another to take home.  Will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have frequented here many times. If you want a great homemade Italian meal, this is the place to go. It is not fancy, it is not brand new, but the service is impeccable and the food is delicious.  Even if what you want is not on the menu, they will try their best to prepare it for you anyway."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite Italian restaurants! I have yet to find one that comes close in the Phoenix area. So sad that they closed the Gilbert and Mesa locations!

It's in a strip mall, which is odd since it's such a nice restaurant. Don't let the exterior fool you!

I always start off with the ravioli for an appetizer. I don't even like ravioli but I'm obsessed with this dish. It's light and delicious. I'll order one for the table and everyone always raves about it. I'm not a fan of red sauce, so I like that this is a white sauce with a dollop of red. Just the right amount!

The chicken fiorentina is my go-to. The chicken is light, the sauce is flavorful and delicious, and the spinach and cheese (not too cheesy!) are perfect additions. I can't get enough! I recommend saving some bread to wipe up the rest of the sauce with...yum!

I live in south Chandler, so the only downside is that there is no longer a location near me. I've made the trek up to the Scottsdale location once. Such a shame as I'd love to go there much more often!"}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for more,  great service, lovely ambience and superb food! Our waiter couldn't have done more for us, the shrimp cocktail was as expected, divine. My husband had scampi to start which was delicious, so flavorful. I had the Zuppa pesca de Mediterranean which was out of this world and I will order again. My husband had linguine con vongole for his main course and in his words \"delicious\". He had the cannoli and I had a Gelato with a crust (? ) which was phenomenal. Can't recommend this place enough. We'll be back soon. Why can't every restaurant understand customer service and food quality like this."}
{"text":"Had dinner there again last night !! It's like a wonderful family restaurant in the \"old country \".  If you visiting and staying at a local hotel this is a 100 percentage hit! If your a local and you don't have your favorite Italian spot this is it!!! I'm 100 percent Italian and I love it and I'm a great cook!"}
{"text":"Wow. This used to be the best Italian restaurant in AZ. Now it is mediocre at best. The service is mediocre, the food is mediocre; it's like they lost their pride. What a disappointment."}
