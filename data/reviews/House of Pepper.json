{"text":"RANT REVIEW:  I haven't written a bad review on any restaurant, that I can recall.  Really because, I get that this is their livelihood... and I understand all of the trimmings that come with that. I also want to add that I held off on  this review, until I got a chance to speak with a couple of my colleagues that have been to the same restaurant. It was important for me to determine, that I wasn't the only one that had this experience. They had similar experiences... so here is the story.   Story: I asked for a Kung Pao beef, and recieved what appeared to be deep-fried (black and candied) flour with two microscopic pieces of beef inside of the entire meal. (Take me literally, because I mean this literally.) I called the lady over and asked her  what it was. She said flour, and started yelling something to the cook, in Chinese... watched me, as I sat there breaking open my candied flour to discover that there was virtually no meat inside of any of it. When I was finally  through and moved all the Kung Pao Flour off of my container, clearly disgusted with their fraudulent behaviour, she comes over and asked me if I'd like some more beef.  At this point, I have zero trust in this restaurant and obviously decline.  I mean, what is their cost of a single portion of beef for this meal? $1? I paid $6... 600% Gross Profit, seems like a fair trade. No attempt  was given to refund me my money, not that this had anything to do with that because it didn't. However,  that would have been  a decent thing to do, but I guess if you aren't selling people what they're paying for you don't really have the moral compass to do the decent thing. I can't even give them a good rating on the flavor of my Kung Pao 'Flour', because it just tasted like it was deep fried in soy sauce or something. I firmly believe, that trickery and food are a dangerous combination. Tricking me into thinking that there is meat in my dish is a very insulting behaviour.   TLDR:  Our standards for food in the GTA are high and we pay good money, for good food... places like this need to close down and make room for businesses that respect their food and their customers..."}
{"text":"I always get their spicy chicken wings / squid / fish fillet and ask for the chili oil to go. Can't go wrong with their teriyaki beef / chicken ad well. Their house special fried rice is quite tasty too. In all for the prices, their food quality are very good - they never overcooked my spicy squid and always fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Great bang for your dollar . The meal are  huge almost to big for me. All items under $6.50  average price $5.50. The taste a bit like Canadian Chinese.  This is a food court.  A must try if you want a low budget lunch.  Verdict: If you are looking for fake Asian food, with plenty of grease and MSG - go ahead, come here (but please don't call it Chinese food, at least have the decency to call it Westernized Chinese), but if you want authentic, don't bother."}
{"text":"This place not only does not taste good, but it also engages in false advertising, unethical business behaviour, and has poor customer service.  My family spent a lot of time outside their shop, examining the menu in great detail. We were very much attracted to the sizzling pan on which the dish is offered, which we saw many customers in the food court enjoying. The worker there interacted with us many times, trying to persuade us to change to a set meal, but we were adamant in ordering separately. Despite the total being much more expensive, we were vocal in our desire to receive the sizzling pan.  When our food arrived, it came packaged in white Styrofoam boxes. We immediately asked why, and requested that it be changed immediately. They refused. We didn't understand why it didn't come in the sizzling pan, as promised by the photos and as enjoyed by the other customers. The worker said it was because \"we never asked to have it explicitly, nor did we pay an additional amount to have it served as such\". Throughout the entire ordeal, she had an attitude that reflected a mentality that we were wrong - that, as customers, the onus was on us to ask and request. What kind of messed up logic is this?  Another worker then chimed in, stating that we wouldn't want the sizzling pans anyway since \"they're dirty, and the Styrofoam boxes are much cleaner\". How idiotic of her to say that, since it means that they're running an unsanitary business that preys on customers unethically. By this point, we decided that it was pointless to argue, and just left.  The food was utterly nasty. My satay fried udon had no satay flavour whatsoever, and the Singaporean noodles likewise had no curry flavour. We had to go home and refry the two dishes, adding in more satay and curry. The company is shameless in its desire to make profits by decreasing the quality of its ingredients and increasing its revenue through the aforementioned means. The pad thai was a poor excuse, and the flavour was flat. It literally tasted like ketchup.  I rarely write scathing reviews, but I had a dismal and poor experience here. I will never return, and discourage others from coming here. There are many better options in the food court!"}
{"text":"John C is on point about the bang for your buck. Ive gone here to eat for years, and have always remembered the plaza as \"Cheap & Good\". Not only do I come here for Lunch & Dinner, Ive ordered tons of party trays from them over the years for my kids birthday's. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"As the name would imply they do make some dishes on the spicy side.  I had ordered a fried pork chop on rice and was asked if I wanted it spicy and I had said yes.  Honestly I don't know if they accept other forms of payment but some of the places I know only take cash so I assume most of the places in the food court only take cash.  After paying you are given some sort of \"stub\" for your pickup so they can pick up your food when it's ready.  When this food court gets busy it's understandable that they'd need to do this.  Other places you can hear them over a PA system announcing numbers for pickup.    This place we just hung around waiting for it.  (#21) which is the fried pork chop.  I had a bunch of people with me and we just ordered a few dishes from a few different places in the food court.  This dish was good because seriously it's a deep fried spicy pork chop.  The rice wasn't anything special.  Most of the menu is fried it seems which is fine because fried tastes good."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this food court in a while but had a rare craving for fried food after a so called friend told me to \"grow up\" after I opened up to her about some issues i was having.  So I went to a dingy food court.  Anyways, I ordered the spicy fried squid with fried rice.  Squid had the perfect amount of batter , good saltiness level and was freshly fried (ie crispy) and came with a generous portion of fried rice.  Best of all, is that it was under $7, tax in."}
{"text":"The complex where the food court is located is affectionately called \"China Mall\" as all the tenants are Chinese. This is all good as there are 7-8 food stalls to choose from and the one with the longest line is this one.  My buddy always has the fried squid on rice and I usually mix it around. This time I had the seafood noodles.  They serve it up fast and prices are about $6. be careful as some specials include a drink and soup and some do not depending on which menu you order from. hey seem to have 4 menus so look at the photo and tell the pretty girl which one you want. The specials come with the drink/soup but are more basic items like beef chow mein.  This is cheaper than McD's and may have less salt, fat and sugar than the fast food joints.  if you can get there before 1145am then you beat the other coworkers looking for a chinese fix, or take a later lunch. No fun 15 deep in a line and there are 4 EMS guys, and 3 cops in front of you."}
{"text":"Yeah I come here like once a week - defs a favourite spot. Their teriyaki chicken with rice is so tasty and comes with mushrooms and broccoli. The fried pork chops and beef with rice noodles are also so good, and so savoury (but definite eater's remorse afterwards, as they're both pretty greasy). The 8 delight tofu (8 different veggies and meats) is very tasty with much less grease. Regardless of what you pick, you get a solid meal with generous portions for ~$7...can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My second choice in the Dixie park food court. They have great fried rice dishes, awesome teriyaki chicken and their meals are like $6 each not bad at all for all the food you get. Always fresh and fast. Lunch gets busy so come early or call and order ahead."}
{"text":"I originally came here because I wanted to order from Pho Tai Loi (based on favourable reviews), but by 6pm on a Monday evening, it was closed.  Arigato & Lemongrass were also both closed.  Perhaps they're just closed on Mondays, I dunno.  Anyway, being an indecisive mood, this place was a bit of a nightmare for me based on the stalls that were opened.  Other than the Chinese BBQ place, the offerings consisted of Fried Rice, Various Fried Noodle Dishes, Pork Chop of Rice, Fried Fish with Sweet Corn Sauce, etc. etc.  Basically quick stir fried meals that can be served within a few minutes.  I just decided on a stall based on the lady who hawk me in order to set her stall apart from the others.  I asked her how the Pad Thai was, she said, \"Good\".  I could tell by the colour that it was far from authentic.  It was edible, but no tamarind, no wedge of lime, no lemongrass.  Just some pho noodles with 2 shrimp, slices of either pork &/or chicken, bean sprouts in a sweet & tangy sauce.  Friend's Chilli Chicken was better, but heavy on the rice, light on the protein.  More garlicky than chilli.  Both dishes were ~$7 and portions do come in that large rectangular styro container.  And I'm pretty sure both dishes were chalk full of MSG, but again, what do I expect?  Lady at Honey Pepper grabbed food from the Yogi Noodle stall.  So I'm thinking their both run by the same owner."}
