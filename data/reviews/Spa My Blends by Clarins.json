{"text":"Came here for a girls night. There were 7 of us, and it was an AMAZING experience.
Through beginning to end, the service was superb. The robe was very comfortable, so was the sheet/blanket in the massage room (I wanted to buy them, and they do sell, but it's too expensive) They also have a variety of snacks in the lounge. They offer Clarins products (both skin care and make up) for you to use/try in the powder room. 

The facilities are fantastic - they have this dryer, which will dry your swimsuits in a couple minutes.
My therapist was very attentive, it was a truly relaxing session. The sculp massage at the end was a highlight."}
{"text":"We've been to pretty much all the spas in Toronto and this is easily the best one we've visited. 

The facilities are clean and relaxing and the shared common space is great - it gets natural light and has big beds that you can lounge on (great for couples). Massage staff are wonderful and the entire experience is very relaxing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had been to this spa before, and really liked it, especially the sun room.  Regrettably, my friend and I will not get to go here.  We made about five calls between us, and no one called back.  It has been four days since we tried to book our appointments, and still no response.  It's a nice spa, but not worth six calls."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing spectacular about this place. very pretentious and mediocre. I went with my husband and we both agreed that compared t oother places we have been (Four Seasons, Hammam, Trump Hotel) this was all show and no substance.  Everything was nice and clean and everyone was courteous. But it was so cold, and mediocre compared to the rest of the spas in that class. The two masseuses we had couldn't be bothered to work harder!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my time here. I enjoyed my couples massage. After the massage, we were invited to spend the day at the spa- pools, sauna, steam room, and lounging center. I would definitely check this place out if you're visiting in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This was the first place I got a massage ever so it has set my standards high and needless to say, I have been back many times! It has always been classy. The service is spectacular. Once, they made a mistake booking into the wrong month and made huge amends correcting it and compensating us and made us feel important. They have great tea and snacks as well. Best for an all-girls outing because there's lots of girls-only areas but there's a lovely co-ed lounge and pool too."}
{"text":"Beware! If you buy any products the cost is factored into the automatic tip applied when you leave! I had a a 225$ facial which was AMAZING! But they applied the automatic 15-18% tip to the cost of the service and the product. 

I wasn't paying attention and ended up leaving a 70$ tip for one $225 service. 

Ritz, this is a really shady and not a nice way to end a perfectly delightful service."}
{"text":"Getting a massage at the Ritz-Carlton was an amazing and luxurious experience. I came to my massage very early to enjoy the facilities (mostly the pool and jacuzzi). There are waiting rooms where you can read a magazine, enjoy the fruit, and have some tea (it was so good that I ordered some later). The bathrooms have lockers and lots of toiletries. There are many products from Clarins that you can sample. For my massage, I ordered a 90-min deep tissue massage, plus an additional 15 minutes of the foot ritual. The massage therapist was excellent, and even showed me particular stretches for helping to remove muscle tension at the end. The deep tissue massage can be painful, and is meant to be more therapeutic, so try something else if you are aiming more for relaxation (i.e. hot stone massage)."}
{"text":"I had a very generous gift certificate for Spa My Blend so I decided to try out their HydraFacial. The spa grounds are absolutely stunning, especially the pool area and the sun room. Definitely a luxurious experience. The robes, spa slippers and anything you might need are at your fingertips. The pool area was quiet and the water temperature was warm enough. The little snacks in the sun room are great for munching while you lounge; the general layout of the room and the couches are especially perfect for a group spa getaway or some alone time. 

Now onto my actual procedure; I had tried the HydraFacial before at Beauty Bar in Toronto and loved it so I decided to try it again here. For such a mark-up, I certainly did not get the same experience or results. The esthetician was way too rough with the hydrafacial wand that I thought she was going to scar my face. It was not a relaxing or a pleasurable experience. Thankfully, my skin didn't suffer too hard but you could tell that this wasn't a well-trained nurse or esthetician but pretty amateur hour in my opinion. She was not thorough and my \"procedure\" lasted for less than 45 minutes. 

The entrance was also a bit underwhelming. There were too many unnecessary gift shop type chachkas on the adjacent wall; I would have liked to see more skincare products or lines. I would come back here and maybe try one of their massages and take advantage of the facilities."}
{"text":"Had a WONDERFUL day at the Spa with my Mom during my last trimester of pregnancy. They were so accommodating and I got to enjoy a lot more of the amenities than I thought I would be able to. The massage was one of the best ever and my facial was wonderful thanks to the fabulous aesthetician Naomi, who even went as far to surprise me with a little gift bag for baby and I upon checking out. The service is incomparable to any spa in Toronto I've experienced, and I am a spa lover! Going to the spa is a luxurious experience and a nice treat so if you're going to spend some money and pamper yourself then do it where you are guaranteed to have your expectations exceeded and where service is their utmost priority! They truly make their guests feel like the most important people there! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I loved the Ritz Spa. Amenities are great and very relaxing. We had a bachelorette here and everyone enjoyed their service and perks.

Robes, slippers, hairbrushes, clarin hair and body lotions, razors, feminine products, anything you need - they got it.

Very sweet lady who did my pedicure, one hour of relaxation!

Oh yes, I did go ham on the free snacks - white choc pretzels, dark choc bark, nuts, dried pineapples and peaches, bite size carrot muffins and granny smith apples. Sloane tea was a delight too. You leave with a mini sample gift bag.

Was going to deduct one mark for the price but you're at the Ritz, you should know. Would become a regular if not for their $$$$. Parking is \"valet\" at $15 instead of regular $35 for spa customers."}
{"text":"I love a nice spa and this one did not disappoint. Had the jet lag treatment which gives you the best of all worlds in 90 minutes- exfoliation/back massage, foot massage & tired leg treatment, mini facial. I added the eye treatment as well since I've never met a product by Clarins I didn't like. Lovely staff, beautiful facilities- perfect relaxation on a rainy day in Toronto. Go. Spend the day. Enjoy."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here to enjoy a nice spa and massage experience. This spa is located in the Ritz Carlton so you know it's going to be quite fancy and you would be coming in with high expectations of this place.  The hotel is quite nice and loved the d√©cor here. We arrived about an hour early to take advantage of the amenities prior to our massage. We went to the main reception to check-in and fill out the necessary paperwork. After that, we got a tour of the services and amenities available to our spa by one of the staff. They have a swimming pool, steam room, sauna, hot tub, showers, and lockers. They provide you with slippers, bath robe and a towel. The men's change room was quite nice equipped with some basic toiletries for you freshen up after your spa such as mouthwash, hair gel/spray, comb etc...
My friend and I took advantage of the amenities. The steam room was quite hot. They also have a water station where you can stay hydrated as being in such intense heat can cause dehydration. They have men's lounge with a tv, comfortable couches and tea. They also have a lounge area where you can wait prior to your massage. Spa my Blend by Cairns is in one of the nicest hotels out there. My masseuse Salvatore was great. He went through the whole experience very detailed and in a professional manner. I booked an aromatherapy/Swedish massage for an hour. I was given the choice of 3 aromatherapy oils to use for my massage. All of them smelled great. Salvatore was super strong and I could feel his arms and hands dig into body which was great because I love that pressure exerted onto me as I was super sore and tired. It was good that he also checked in with me at various points to see if the pressure was alright. At one point, I was so tired that I actually dozed off. I just felt so relaxed and felt like a million bucks after the massage. Make sure you ask for Salvatore if you want a nice powerful massage! After the massage, my friend and I hung out in the lounge area. They had nice comfy beds and they also had snacks!! Great way to unwind and relax even more after your massage. If you arrive early for your massage, great area to relax and enjoy before your massage. They also have a menu where you can order snacks and food if you want to grab a bite.  After relaxing in the main lounge area till it was nearly closing time, we went back out to pay for our massages. They don't do direct billing so the spa staff gives you an insurance receipt and the transaction receipt to submit to your insurance. Overall, a wonderful experience here from the spa. Definitely on the more expensive side than most spas but if you got insurance coverage then its worth it!! Will definitely consider coming back in the near future!"}
{"text":"***not gluten allergy friendly***  I expected that somewhere conscientious as the Ritz in combination with Clarins would help me with creating a spa day for my cousin and I that would not leave me sick and aching. After being asked on the phone about specific allergies, I told at least six different people on staff during our day that I had a gluten allergy, but no one had actually researched which Clarins products were okay for me, so I couldn't purchase any to take home as planned. Even the masseuse seemed surprised by my allergy and had to alter my service. I'm not sure what she skipped, but it wasn't the best service I'd ever had. Not even close. We ended our day with a snack in the lounge, where I was glutened by the \"gluten free\" spa menu. My wonderful day was overshadowed by stomach pain, diarrhea, hair loss and vomiting that followed that evening and three days after. Waste of $900, won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few spas in the city and this one is definitely my favourite! I love the co-ed lounge space, it's nice and bright because of the skylight. There are day beds for you to just hang out for a few hours before or after your treatment. In the women's change room there's a separate room with about 6 adjustable beds if you want to nap or just to have some peace and quiet. There's a good selection of snacks and Sloane tea - if you're hungry you can order from their menu as well!

As for massages, I've only had good experiences here - they're very professional massage therapists and extremely courteous. I love how they provide you with tips and advice at the end of the session to help ease pain or tension. They even demonstrate the stretches you will need to do - I haven't seen this elsewhere yet. The rooms are really nice, I did a couples treatment once and went in the cloud 9 suite which is a large and beautiful space! 

It gets kind of busy on weekends, usually all the day beds are taken and the bathrooms get a bit more crowded - which can be annoying when you want to get your things and people are just standing around in there looking at their phones. Other than that, try to book during the weekdays. (I came around noon on a Tuesday and I had the place all to myself!)"}
{"text":"18% gratuity on spa services - yuk. Luckily we have benefits so its not that bad but for that reason alone i probably wont go back. The massages we got were great. The food is expensive but thats what you would expect from the hotel. The hot tub is tiny, the pool was really cold. It doesnt't have the zen spa experience i was looking for. There are only two showers so dont go with a big group...
It was just okay.. i prefer elmwood or body blitz"}
{"text":"This is the best spa in town, it must be the Ritz.

Although super expensive, you do get what you pay for.  If you're looking for the best, do spend.  I had the 60 min massage. O M G

And! the staff is courteous and friendly, the opposite of snobby!  

Because we had the 60 minute massage, we received a complimentary spa day pass which granted us all-day access to the salt water lap pool, hot tub, sauna, experience showers, eucalyptus steam room, green tea infused vitality pool, relaxation lounge and co-ed sanctuary.

Indulge yourself.  Spend the day at the spa!!"}
{"text":"This place is the definition of luxurious. 

We started our day off at the gym which was extremely clean and well kept. Next was our 60 min massage - I chose West + East. My RMT did a thorough job of explaining the massage and getting to know what I was looking for. I found the massage very relaxing but also informative as she went through stretches I could do at home and how to care for an existing injury. Next we went through a couple cycles of the steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, lap pool and hot tub. Afterwards, we met in the coed sanctuary and enjoyed the cozy blankets, complimentary snacks and tea. 

The attention to detail here is exceptional - orange infused water, towels over ice and cucumber, friendly and helpful staff, pristine locker rooms - I could go on. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his 35th bday surprise. We had a couples massage. The massage was great and both RMT seemed very knowledgeable and experienced. The ambiance was also really nice. The good part is that you can use their facility pool / gym after as well. There's a common area where you can lounge which was really nice. My only complaint is that they should offer better fruits and snacks since its suppose to be a nicer premium spa."}
{"text":"One of the best spas in town, their service is excellent. Change room is big and clean. We arrived early to use the pool before our RMT massage. The pool is actually a bit small, so don't expect to be able to swim lengths. The RMT massage was great and I got more pressure when I asked for more which really hit the spot. I love that their massage beds can be heated as do a lot of other high end places because I tend to get cold easily. After the massage we stopped by the lounge to enjoy some Sloan tea with honey and some light refreshments which was nice. I have to say the lounge was quite packed though and we were only able to find some chairs to sit on instead of the nice lounging beds/ sofas. We then continued to the green tea vitality pool which is really just like a small hot tub that you can lie down in. This is where I took off a star because my bikini bottom got a bleach stain from sitting on one of the openings that shoot water out for massaging purposes and it's not something you can avoid. I now have to replace them as the stain will not come off."}
{"text":"The Ritz-Carlton spa is my favourite get away and go to place in Toronto, but be prepared to spend a full day, take your time and enjoy all the amenities that are there for you to relax, The plush robes and slippers are very nice, feel free to have a glass of champagne before your massage, I always request to go see Melissa she is the best massage attendant there, she brings you into a very tranquil room and has a fantastic touch, I personally do not like reflexology done on my feet but the way she touches my feet with a firm hand I don't feel tickled but relaxed, be sure to get a consultation from the make up lady  from Clarins specializing in all skin types they have skin creams and serums  that specialize in antiaging ECT, there more than happy to give you samples anything that you're interested in, when making a full day of it it's great to go with your best friend or even your partner, as it's a great escape and you feel that the staff at the Ritz-Carlton are there to make your visit wonderful, if it is your first time be sure to ask for a tour of the place so you are aware of what is available for you, i've been to many spas before The reason why I get this five stars is because it has everything, and it really gives you the feeling of elegance, I could not afford to go here every day so I do make this my special vacation inside the city, everybody deserves this, if you're thinking of giving a gift to a person a gift certificate from the Ritz-Carlton spa makes a great gift, thank you Ritz Carlton for doing your best always"}
{"text":"For our birthdays, instead of buying something, Gord and I take each other to the spa.  Last week was my birthday and today we went to the Spa My Blends by Clarins at The Ritz-Carlton to celebrate.  It's the first time we'd been there.

Because we were having a 60 minute massage, we had a complimentary spa day pass which granted us all-day access to the salt water lap pool, hot tub, sauna, experience showers, eucalyptus steam room, green tea infused vitality pool, relaxation lounge and co-ed sanctuary.

Before our massage, we waited in the co-ed sanctuary, where there were chairs and beds so you can relax while you wait.  There were complimentary treats such as almonds, dark chocolate almond bark, apples, tea, water, etc.  You can also order wine and a light meal (at a cost).

Then it was time for our couples massage in the Cloud 9 room.  Elena was Gord's masseuse and he said she gave him a really good massage.  Salvatore was my masseuse and he was excellent!  He found spots that I didn't even know I had issues with.

After our massage I went back to the women's area and had a short snooze on one of the beds in the relaxation lounge.  Then I spent some time in the steam room before heading for a shower.  The shower was fun.  There were eight jets in the walls pointing at me, a regular shower head and a raindance shower head ... and I had them all on at the same time!  

The staff was very friendly, always saying \"hello\" and asking if I needed anything.  They supply everything including shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, razors, hair gels, deodorant, etc.  You just have to bring yourself and your bathing suit!

Because we were celebrating my birthday and our anniversary, they sent us home with a gift bag.
 
It was a very nice experience and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Absolute perfection. Treated myself to a birthday massage. My RMT, Miranda, was absolutely delightful. She knew exactly what she was doing - listened to my concerns and tailored the massage to my preferences. 

The front desk attendants were super friendly. When they learned it was my birthday they gave me a small 'treat bag' filled with great sample gifts and a gift card. An excellent end to a wonderful half day at the spa.

The relaxation room is co-ed and it is bright. VERY bright. White and grey marble and white walls. Still relaxing but most spa waiting/relaxation rooms are 'warmer' in colour scheme to encourage relaxation. 

You won't regret the spa services at the Ritz-Carlton. It's the Ritz, HELLO. A nice oasis to combat the Toronto hustle and bustle. Yes, it's on the higher end price-wise, so a once-in-a-while treat (and if you have work benefits, even better. Ask for a receipt.)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best. Spacious clean and sophisticated. The service is amazing and I love that it has the private relaxation area as well as a large co-ed area where you can order drinks and dine in your robes. Went with a fellow new mom for a treat and we enjoyed it very much perfect retreat."}
{"text":"Sooo if you have $300 to spare, to blow, to indulge, I say you drag your behind to this spa at the Ritz Carlton Hotel. I did and was completely blown away be the ritziness and makeup of their facility!

I had a 1 hr hydra facial and their 90 minutes Art of Touch body massage. They were both done by Elizabeth..to me she is Elizabeth The Great! Both facial and massage were done in this majestic room with a gorgeous chandelier and coffered high ceilings.

All of their 60 minute services include a Complimentary Spa Day Pass which grants all-day access to the Salt Water Lap Pool, Hot Tub, Sauna, Eucalyptus Steam Room, Green Tea Infused Vitality Pool, Fitness Centre, Men's & Women's Relaxation Lounge and Co-Ed Sanctuary.

They serve white chocolate covered pretzels and Sloane fine teas in their relaxation rooms which blow away the relaxation rooms at the Shangrila Caudalie by Paris Hammam Miraj Spa.

Hands down this Spa is the most luxurious and the customer service is the most exuberant in the whole city!"}
{"text":"Oh boy. I know where all the savings are going to go. Hubby and I went for a couple's massage. Excellent therapists, beautiful room with high ceilings. This facility is truly upscale. Excellent toiletries, amazing jet spa shower, great service. Their unisex lounge was great with some fruit, dried fruit and organic teas that are complimentary. You can lie on one of their lounge beds there, look at the beautiful skylight and order some wine. I used to go to Elmwood Spa, but this is leagues ahead in ambience and quality of therapists."}
{"text":"This location is found inside the Ritz Carlton.  Once you step off the elevator, it is like you are transported into an entirely different world.  I like the fact that with any spa service there is complimentary parking.  From stepping in and being offered a beverage to the full use of the gym/ green tea infused pool, to the spa facilities (sauna/ whirlpool) and I really enjoyed the break room where you can just kick back and chill out.  The massage was very nice and the therapist explained all the aches and pains I was experiencing and how to self help.  This has to be one of the better run spas I have experienced in Toronto."}
