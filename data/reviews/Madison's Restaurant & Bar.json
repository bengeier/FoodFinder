{"text":"My friends and I just recently went in to madisons for a friends birthday weekend, and although we didn't eat anything, the waitress we had was just adorable, and the renovations they underwent really spruced the place up to a Moxie's level. Way to go madisons!"}
{"text":"I don't care for this place. Directly next to Madison's is a lounge which used to be smoked in, filled with VLTs. Even more so, I dislike the staff. However, the 15-year-olds in the kitchen cook up a mean ( and formidably greasy) Mediterranean and Greek God pizza."}
{"text":"Best pub in my area. Clean, friendly service and great food. Newly renovated in 2011. I recommend honey bacon burger with yam fries, Rueben sandwich and lobster Mac n cheese. Great place for a work or birthday party. Would book in advanced especially for weekends or evenings gets quite busy. Love the fire place comfy chairs on a cold day."}
{"text":"Today we took our work team here for lunch. The idea of eating lunch in a bar is not that appealing at least not for me. Let me run down what we had and the comments I gathered from each. 

Burger and fries - the request was to have mustard on it, it didn't come with it to the waitress had to go find some. I think she went to safeway to get it as by the time she got back the burger was cold ad dry. He say the fries were good. 

Nachos with the homemade salsa, not sure why this took so long to get, must have had to go home to make it. 

French onion soup - this one had what looked like a piece of meat in it. When the waitress was asked, she took it to the back and came back with the comment \"it's a crouton, French onion soup is made with croutons, you know\" okay, who knew croutons taste like meat also. I guess if your looking for some mystery meat that supposed to be a crouton, this is your place to go.  
The others had the Lobster Mac and cheese and they said that was fine.

The service was a poor girl trying to cover two tables of 8 each, way too much for one girl. Well one girl here today. This place misses Tracey, a girl they had this past spring. She works at Scotsman Well and is amazing. Next time we need to take our team out I think we'll go to the Well."}
{"text":"Since getting renovated, this place has become more appealing - both in atmosphere and the food. I've had the chance to dine here a few times over the course of the summer and every time it's been great. Their basics like wings and pizza are pretty tasty, and normally I don't venture off the basics but I decided to try pasta (lobster mac and cheese) and I was thoroughly surprised!  It was oven baked, gooey with cheese, crusted with bread crumbs and had REAL chunks of lobster in it! I only managed to stuff myself with half a serving before packing the rest up for a much anticipated next-day lunch . . . midnight snack (who are we kidding here? Lol)

They have daily specials for both drinks and food which is pretty awesome. And even if you're not into the specials, you're not forking out more than $20-30 for a decent meal and drinks."}
{"text":"Get the tables close to the fireplace on cold winter nights. Hot toddy and Bison burger to keep warm.  Great sliders plain and fancy.   Madison lager house draft made by big rock brewery. 

Great brunch on weekends as well. I used to get a huge Shepard's pie but the bison burger is huge and filling."}
{"text":"For the holidays the bf and I went to Calgary to visit his family and on one of the evenings we took some time to go for wings with a buddy of his we haven't seen in two and a bit years.  It took 2 hours of online research to determine where we wanted to go for wings, and we settled on Madisons despite some of the reviews as the wing variety seemed worthwhile.

First impression: it was a nice clean, relatively quiet place - the sports guys were all sitting at the bar near the odd assortment of gambling machines (something you don't see in BC), and we were on the other side of a pseudo wall that toned them down a bit.  Our server was quite nice, she took our drink orders and we went over the menu.

Between the three of us we shared a bunch of wings and relaxed.  Here's what we tried:

1. Greek = delicious, love the added cheese and great seasoning
2. Lemon Herb = needs a bit more lemon but otherwise tasty though the greek has more herb flavour so I would love the lemon to stand out more
3. Thai Peanut = love the added peanut bits, nice thick sauce with rich flavour!
4. Szechuan Hoisin = great spice, not huge on the hoisin taste compared to what I expected but it's got great heat and the sauce proportion is just right
5. Maple Bacon = not enough bacon and the maple is just syrop that hasn't been thickened enough to stick to the wings, might not get this one again unless they can make the sauce stick better
6. Salt & Pepper = you can tell they do a good job of cooking the wings from the taste of this one, very light on the s&p but the cook on the wings were so good i'd eat them again anyway
7. Sweet Thai Chili = VERY pleasantly surprised by this one!  it's not your typcial 'bought the sauce at costco and dip the wings in it' sauce like everyone else does.  It wasn't super sweet, had great chili flavour, and the heat was subtle.

All in all i'd order most of those flavours again, the service was prompt and pleasant, one basket was forgotten but when you order 7 on wing night that's going to happen, at least when we asked it was recovered right away (we knew they were confused as to which table had ordered them).  The drinks were good, I tried the Orange Creamsicle drink they make with whipped cream vodka and it was lovely.

Definitely a return-to choice for us when we visit Calgary again!"}
{"text":"Madison's has been around for quite a long time. They renovated a while ago and it's really quite nice inside. I've been here lots of times and when I lived up in Beddington, I used to order pizza from them all the time. It's one of my favorite places for pizza. They make it thick and loaded up with a good helping of ooey gooey cheese. That's the way I like it!

A couple of years ago, I took some out of town relatives here for brunch. It was great. They had a good selection of items.

The service at Madison's has been consistently good which can make or break your dining experience. I've never had anything to complain about service or food-wise. It's one of my favorite restaurants in Calgary and wish I lived closer so I could go more often."}
{"text":"#113 As a well-traveled American (shut up!, we do exist, though we are rare as a US hockey gold medal in the Olympics) whom has been living north of the 49th parallel for 2 years 1 month+, I have struggled to find a good pizza anywhere in western Canada (other than Lorenzo's Pizzeria in Calgary west to Vancouver) and only one good pizza place west of the Mississippi River in the United States (which happens to be in San Francisco's Castro District, at The Sausage Factory (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-sausage-factory-san-francisco?ob=1)).

For several months now, we have had pizza delivered to our workplace, XACT Downhole Telemetry, Inc., in a mysterious white box either with numbers on them or a description of the type of pizza that is in each box. No flyers; no labels anywhere. No way to know whom made the pizza. Odd for a business not to have their logo anywhere much less everywhere possible but okay.

Then, today, as I boldly went where no man has gone before, I \"caught\" the pizza delivery guys in the act. I surrounded them forcing them to tell me the name hence this review. They promised to bring flyers on their next trip (since so many people here including myself love the pizza). I uploaded 3 pictures of the pizzas but not before my co-workers had already started eating the pizza!

My favourite is a deep dish Chicago style BBQ Chicken variety that has BBQ sauce, chicken, red onions, cheese (but not too much) (apparently, #25); I also like the deep dish Chicago style pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper, beef, and red onion as well.

For those vegetarian types, they do offer that and that was present but I did not partake of that.

The delivery guys are nice and pleasant to deal with and pretty quick considering we ordered 10+ deep dish Chicago pizzas plus a vegetarian sandwich for the lone vegetarian.

So, for now, I have three total pizza places that I have graced the walls of my stomach and left it very happy:

The newly discovered Madison's Restaurant & Bar in northwest Calgary
Lorenzo's Pizzeria in the Mission/17th Avenue/Red Mile District in central Calgary
San Francisco's Castro District's The Sausage Factory

It's good to see the food fare in Calgary improving; I know Calgarians like to eat and party hard.

The one thing I cannot figure out is how someone found out about their delivery (and pizza).

Time to call Leonard Nimoy and go 'In Search Of'....."}
{"text":"horrible.  had a date here.  pizza was like puke on a plate.  pasta was snot in a bowl"}
{"text":"We come every Friday just about always friendly and great service.. We have tried almost everything lol.. So glad to see the fish and chips back on special I have yet to find a place in Calgary that has good fish this place has the best.. Being from NB we can be picky about our fish and chips but they are awesome and the pizza is amazing as well.. Definitely somewhere people should try.."}
{"text":"Based on one recent visit, Madison's Restaurant and Bar in North Calgary - between Huntington Hills and Country Hills - stood out as a great place to eat and drink. The service our group received was exceptional down to every little detail. Our server was timely and friendly, going out of her way to make sure our visit was one to remember. The inside of the restaurant is very clean and has a higher-end pub feel, with seating offered at regular tables, booths, and high chairs, as well as the bar. They also have a bunch of TV's that are conveniently placed for watching a game. Based off a quick browse of the menu, Madison's seems to charge standard prices for their food and drinks. Gone are the days of $7 pub burgers, but quality and innovation have replaced cheap and quick plates. That's totally cool by me!

For $16 I ordered the Lobster Mac 'n Cheese as I hadn't had it in years and had mad cravings for it. The portion is much larger than it looks and comes with garlic bread on the side. The sauce was delicious - creamy, cheesy, smooth and not too heavy. The penne wasn't overcooked and remained its firmness during the baking process. Nothing I hate more than soggy pasta, so this was a real treat seeing as how many pubs screw this up. What I loved the most was the chunks of baby lobster, which tasted fresh and mild and accompanied the cheese perfectly. I had a few Kokanees and they arrived nice and cold!

With a few options in the adjacent plazas, Madison's Restaurant and Bar might be the best bet for food in the area. The wings next door at The Tipsy Pig are unbeatable, but for elevated pub grub, this one takes the cake! The entire group said their food was top-notch!"}
{"text":"Being called a joke by a restaurant manager is definitely a first for me. 

I've always liked Madison's. Good food, fun, cold beer. So I thought \"why not work here?\". The kijiji ad had been posted for about a month without being filled, and said please apply in person in the evening.  So I get dressed up nicely, drive up there, and ask for the manager. He comes out, listens to what I'm wanting and says \"I'm not going to take your resume. I don't take resumes on Friday nights. NEVER bring that to a place like this on a weekend night, because people are going to think you're a joke. Have you ever even been in the industry?\" 

Now, granted, I should have perhaps thought better of going into a bar on a Friday night. But the ad said evening. It didn't specify which evenings were acceptable or not. And at 6:30 pm when your bar is half full? Yeah, okay. Regardless, berating me and making me feel like an embarrassed idiot for bringing you a resume in good faith and good will was not necessary. My taste for Madison's is pretty much soured now, and I'm quite thankful I got to hold on to my resume so as not to work under such a disrespectful person."}
{"text":"My first poor yelp review.   The chicken tortellini is rediculously salty.  I couldn't eat more than 2 bites.  My Husband's fish and chips -  less than impressed.  One long strip of fried, over cooked fish along side greasy fries.  The MIL gave good reviews on the seafood lasagna.

But here's where my poor rating comes in.... We ordered this as take out. Husband specifically asked if they could just make Mac and cheese out of lobster Mac and cheese for our 4 year old.  Was told by the female order taker that it should be ok and would talk to the manager to decrease the price as it wouldn't contain lobster.  We arrive to be told that they made Mac and cheese but were charging us the full value of the entree!!  Seriously... 17 or 18 bucks for Mac and cheese!  Yeah, they didn't even give us the lobster on the side!  Highway robbery.  Avoid this place as they don't do fair business and have horrible food."}
{"text":"My Grandma and I decided on Madison's one afternoon for a nice lunch and chat.  Well, the chat was nice, the lunch was not.

When we walked in we decided that, since it was pretty empty, we'd receive quick, efficient service.  We weren't very pleased when we were finally seated after waiting five minutes for someone to come up to us.  Our waitress never smiled, and wasn't very friendly.  She was quite introverted which made her seem unhappy or pissed off.  The only time she came around was when she came over.  It was up there with the worst service I've ever had.

The only thing that slightly redeems this place is the decor and the food.  Our meals were pretty good, not great, but pretty good.  The decor is nice because it feels very comfortable with a home-like touch to it.  It was a great atmosphere for the afternoon.

I can't decide if I'll go back to Madison's or not.  The service really threw me and the food wasn't good enough to make me endure another afternoon here."}
{"text":"I like this bar, they have pretty good food and you definately get what you pay for lol (they give you TONS!) and the drink specials are similar to other pubs. They don't have any pool tables, just VLT's, a bar and tables. It's a good place to go out for a dinner date just for a few drinks and a bite to eat."}
