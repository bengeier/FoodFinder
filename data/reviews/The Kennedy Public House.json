{"text":"Sharkey's is no more! And thank God for that. I mean, I know the restaurant options in Bloor West Village are limited, but I really have no idea how that place hung on for as long as it did. With horrible service, brutal food, and staff that spent more time admiring themselves in the mirror than their customers, they created a place that was meant to be avoided. Yet somehow, it managed to exist on that corner for years.

So, imagine my surprise when I saw the beautiful sight of a building permit and brown construction paper covering their windows one day...

A few months later, The Kennedy Public House was born. And boy-oh-boy, this place is exactly what  BWV needs. BWV is virtually void of restaurants serving great food. Ok, so there's earth and Dr. Generosity, but other than that, your choices are pretty limited compared to the tons of options available to other Toronto neighbourhoods. That's why seeing something as untraditional in BWV as The Kennedy is such a welcoming sight.

The Kennedy has a cool vibe that, if you know the neighbourhood, you wouldn't expect to see there. It seems oddly out-of-place while at the same time seems oddly comfortable being there. With a laboriously nice interior space, the entire design is well-thought out a nice to be in. But surprisingly, The Kennedy isn't just nice to look at; it also has exceptionally good food.

The Kennedy's menu doesn't serve your typical pub grub; it's much more imaginative than that. Non-traditional items, like polenta burgers, calamari po'boy sandwiches, and pork belly casoulet easily compliment more traditional pub fare, like wings, macaroni and cheese, and thin crust pizzas. Their menu does a fantastic job of covering everyone while still remaining concise and well-thought out.
Working with a number of local businesses, the Kennedy also proudly sources bread and meats from places you're probably familiar with, like Cobs bread and Wellington County Beef. Nice. I've always found that knowing where the food comes from somehow makes it taste better.

One other thing worth mentioning: The Kennedy has unisex bathrooms. And they've incorporated them into the place really nicely, except for the hand-dryer. The bathroom hand-dryer must be the loudest dam one in the entire free-world. If you happen to be sitting in the back-half of the restaurant, it might even ruin your experience. Hopefully they'll turn to either cloth or paper towels, or they'll just find one that is quieter.

Keep in mind though, if you're looking for a relaxing experience, this isn't the place. With strollers and screaming babies during the day that makes it resemble a Montesorri school, and lineups and loud music in the evening that makes it resemble something at John and Adelaide, The Kennedy doesn't provide a quite and relaxing experience; what they do provide is a killer take on the food you wouldn't expect to find in a typical public house."}
{"text":"A  little rough around the edges, but it has potential.

We went for lunch/brunch on a Saturday around 1 and got a table right away.

Our server was attentive but a little green.  She came offering to clear our plates when we were about 80% done, with no utensils laid on the plate indicating we were done.  No big deal.  She was good otherwise.

The food was hit and miss, with really excellent and crisp sweet potato fries sharing a plate with bland, limp cole slaw.  The chicken sandwich they came with was fab.

The omelette came with a cheese-covered crostini, and when I say it came with, it came with the crostini *inside* the omelette, which didn't do the omelette or especially the crostini any justice.  

The romaine salad was delicious but a little boring.

The decor and ambiance were modern and comfortable, and I can see it being good for a group or a date in the evening.  

The open concept, communal, unisex hand-washing area in the bathroom is a lame trend that needs to die, as are the hurricane-force hand dryers that can be heard from the other side of the restaurant.  

I would definitely go back, especially since it seems like the service and the food might be on an upswing."}
{"text":"We have been there at the first time after moving in, the food is delicious and the service is nice. We want to try every dish in the menu. It became one of the best restaurant! The patio now is open and it's very nice for such a good weather day. The only thing we're concerned is just the proportion of food comparing to the price. But we would love to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"I was here tonight for a first date. My date and I split 3 appetizers: the Pickerel Tostada, Smoked Chili Tiger Prawns, and Sweet Potato Fries. 

The Pickerel Tostada was rich with flavour and ingredients and was my favourite of the bunch but the Smoked Chili Tiger Prawns were a close second. The actual prawns themselves were excellently seasoned and tasted amazing with the spiced honey and tomato cilantro vinaigrette sauce but the lentil quenelle that came with it left something to be desired for me. Perhaps if you get a really good dollop of the spiced honey sauce on the quenelle the flavours improve but eating the lentil quenelle alone left a bland almost cardboard like taste. I think the key is to get some of everything on the fork and then maybe the flavours and consistencies blend nicely together. The plate would have satisfied me much more had it been all prawns and sauce no lentil. The Sweet Potato fries were ante'd up a notch with a dip I'd never had with sweet potato fries before. Unfortunately it's not described on the menu and I didn't think to ask the waiter but it tasted almost like a ranch and blue cheese combination with what looked like green onion mixed it. It was delicious and a welcome change from the traditional chipotle mayo sauce we're all used to. 

Not sure if management pushes the staff to get people in an out ASAP but our waiter brought us our bills while our plates were only half eaten (we had been there maybe 30 minutes) and came back ten minutes later and grabbed our plates (which still had food on them) in a manner that lead me to believe our time was up. He did ask before he walked away with the plates but when the waiter's hand is possessively holding your plate and then they ask you if you're done you say \"Yes master! Sorry master for being so slow\". This as I said was with food still on the plates AND half consumed beverages. I left that restaurant having not finished my cider; a feat that I assure you has never occurred before. 

It was nowhere near closing time and it was a Monday night. 

Though hustled out the evening was enjoyable and we went on to a pub nearby for more drinks. Had we not been rushed, the restaurant would of got at least one maybe two more rounds out of us. 

I'd go back but I won't be hurried out like that again."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for brunch and it was great! The service was excellent. There were $5 brunch caesars, always cause for celebration. I had the braised chicken club and it was packed full of flavour. The chicken was moist and cooked perfectly. Tomato relish was a real treat! My dad had the Kennedy Benedict and was very happy with the Kennedy's twist on this old classic. I can't comment for the atmosphere in the evenings, but at lunch time it's a perfect spot to have a restful meal."}
{"text":"LOVED their MAC and Cheese!!! It's a great place to meet up with friends to catch up or to watch a sports game."}
{"text":"This is a great example of a place that tries too hard with their food and comes up short. The food sounds good and sometimes looks good - but woe, they just can't make it taste good!  I keep trying this place and hope it gets better given the lack of good restos in Bloor West but it always disappoints. Go for drinks on their patio but leave and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Kennedy Public House has become a regular weekend brunch haunt for my husband and I. The staff are always really friendly and quick to help, we've never had a problem with the service. The menu offers good selection, although we have only ever eaten from the breakfast and lunch menus, so I can't speak for dinner.

The food itself is nice and the quality is consistent. I like the fact that we don't always have to head downtown to get a reasonable brunch and we've suggested this place to a number of friends who live in the area. Will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"Went here after taste of danforth to have a couple drinks and watch the Jays game. After ordering our first round of drinks our server nor did anyone else come over to check up on us for a hour an a half before I asked for the bill. The most frustrating part was that the restaurant was dead and they were over staffed. Employees were standing around at the bar chit chatting, and our table was in the bar area so we could be seen clearly. Only stayed as long as we did to watch the rest of the game or else I left a lot sooner. Terrible experience will not be returning and on another note the food was overpriced and the portions looked small"}
{"text":"Nice place decor wise with a good patio. Good service, although a little slow on the drinks side. However the menu really over-promised and under-delivered. Everything sounded amazing reading it, but the execution was disappointing. 

Our table had the calamari which was disappointing as wasn't proper calamari (reformed sticks of it rather than proper rings & tentacles). Also the mac and cheese was a bit of a let down (quite dry, not much cheese sauce to it). I had the steak and tomato salad, steak was cooked well and the goats cheese and blueberries combination worked well. But throwing a big dollop of olive tapenade onto it? That is just not a taste that goes at all well with blueberries."}
{"text":"we've visited here a lot.....lately i notice they're 'letting themselves go'....the too familiar spiral from a solid place to mediocre and now i will probably go elsewhere. More house flies and fruit flies than guests. Washrooms are untidy and more flies. Lack of upkeep in the dining room. food was okay ..... get yourself back together!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent here. Loved their calamari appetizer! I have honestly never experienced calamari without it being rubbery, so props to them on this one. Great spicy flavour, too. We also ordered two pizzas--pulled pork and PBP (pear, blue cheese, pecan, etc)--and enjoyed them. The texture and thickness of the dough (not too thin, not too thick) and the toppings on each were flesh and flavourful. I know another yelper wasn't too impressed with the PBP, but we were fans of them. 

Server definitely fell into the snotty end of the spectrum. Competent enough, sure, but it really left a bitter impression. Never once did she smile at us or give me any assurance that we weren't a major pain in her a$s. (Which we weren't. We aren't fussy diners.) This definitely lessens the chance that I'd go here again, which is a shame, since we had a positive experience with the food. When you're in a city as big as Toronto, I think you can hold out for places that have BOTH great food and service. 

As a side note, the bathroom situation really confused me at first. There was a row of sinks and a few doors alongside these wash stations. When I took this in I thought that this must be some kind of new, hip unisex bathroom thingy (and wondered if I was hip enough to use them, since they clearly threw me off). But venturing closer, I found that behind the doors were individually equipped bathrooms (each with their own sink), so that relaxed me a bit. And then I rationalized that the row of sinks were there for ONLY handwashing---why tie up a bathroom stall if you only need to wash your greasy palms, right? Bloody geniuses...!"}
{"text":"horrible food, horrible service! Ordered the traditional pizza (barely had anything on it) kids mac n cheese (which was just Kraft dinner) nachos, wings both not the greatest. Our server was horrible..had very little patience when we asked questions. We asked if he could recommend a fruity drink that had little alcohol...he's response \"well this is the cocktail menu..\" Definitely won't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! It was busy even for a Tuesday night, although there was a basketball game on. It's a cool atmosphere with unisex bathrooms. The service was a little slow, but wait staff was friendly and polite. Would recommend on a night when you're in the neighbourhood and want something a little different for food but a cool, familiar bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked out and left the restaurant after being lectured by one of
the waitstaff of how they \"run\" things in their restaurant. We asked two other staff if we can move to the next empty table after the other guests left. They said yes it was okay, and so we moved. Then this rude staff came over and and told us we shouldn't have moved yet because she still needs to set up the table. And we said SORRY, and we said we don't mind that she wipes the table while we're there sitting. She then continued saying \"this is not how we run things in this restaurant, next time you have to wait\", in a very demeaning manner-as if we committed a crime! We lost our appetite and just decided to leave. She must really have a very bad day to treat us that way!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times the food and service were very good.

The first time I had the steak and tomato salad and it was just sooo good. There are so many flavours in this dish that every bite is different and delicious. Someone else in our party had the mushroom mac and cheese and although it tasted good, it looked awful. Brown mushrooms don't make a good mac and cheese, I don't think. We were a party of four and our waitress was very attentive despite the fact that the restaurant was full.

The second time I was there I had the same steak and tomato salad and while it wasn't as good as the first time, it was still good. We were a party of three and the restaurant was not very full and our waitress was very friendly but less attentive. When our orders came, there were two errors and both times, the manager came out to apologize, corrected the order, and did not charge us for the mistake.

Wow.

I have to tell you, I will be a patron at a restaurant that makes mistakes and graciously fixes them over a restaurant that has less than stellar food and service or, worse, makes mistakes and doesn't care (are you reading this Locomotive?).

I was really impressed during my second visit and I hope KPH keeps up that quality of service."}
{"text":"Was here for brunch...food was tasty but considering how small the portions are for what you pay, it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Dropped in for brunch today and had a great experience thanks to Jenny who was tending bar.

First of all, I found my prosecco to be flat.  I felt really precious about complaining about it but Jenny offered to open another bottle and pour me a new glass.

We ordered the calamari poor bo' and chef's breakfast.  When our order came out Jenny immediately spotted a problem and diverted the French Toast.  As happens, another server had scooped one of our plates.  She delivered the Po' Boy, explained the situation and assured a Chef's Breakfast was coming on the fly.  Since we'd planned to share the dishes this worked out fine.  The sandwich was delicious as were the sweet potato fries.  When the breakfast arrived, steaming hot, an extra side of the blueberry cornbread was provide for us.  The breakfast which included homemade sausage, eggs and cassoulet was fantastic and worth that little wait.

As a former server, I get that mistakes happen and can be made better or worse by how they are handled.  Jenny's service was spot on and we enjoyed a wonderful brunch thank to it.  

The combined great food and great service is the reason we will be back and will tell our friends to try The Kennedy."}
{"text":"We waited for almost an hour for our food and it was only almost an hour because we decided to walk out. A restaurant with fantastic customer service would proactively tell you that the kitchen is taking a bit longer than usual, instead we had to ask where our food was - twice! by the second time we said forget it since our 14 month old was cranky because she has been waiting to eat her lunch too.

I have never walked out of a restaurant before and with so many other restaurants on Bloor West we decided to leave and get food elsewhere. The staff did apologize and offered free appetizer (gave us the owners business card) for next time we go (that is if we ever go back) but too little too late.

We went to Bread & Roses instead and our daughter enjoyed a turkey pot pie. I really did want to try their food since our friends told us it was good, so it is unfortunate that the service was so poor. And at the end they all said \"the kitchen was backed up and we are so sorry and there is nothing we can do.\" If this was a restaurant that values customer service, there is always SOMETHING you can do to fix it because giving you an appetizer for next time just isn't good enough. Why would I come back next time, when there are so many other great restaurants on Bloor? Shame..."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a group of buddies to celebrate a birthday. We decided on a local place that had a decent beer selection. Thank goodness the company was great, because the experience certainly wasn't. 

Service was spotty. They were out of a couple of beers on their menu, so somebody isn't doing their job. $15 for 6 chicken wings??? Nachos hardly had any toppings. Blue cheese on poutine? Just nasty. Burgers were decent. 

Not worth the money and so loud we were yelling at each other. Third time here but first time in over a year. Unfortunately we won't return. Too many better options in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Lots of fruit flies! Was not a pleasant experience having all these extra \"guests\" constantly flying around you. Food was ok but expensive. Price doesn't justify the establishment. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere here and the location, and the menu is good. But the service is so uneven that you never know what's going to happen. If you're willing to wait a very long time for food, go for it. You may have to, or you may not. At our last visit, my party did not get served for over an hour. When we first asked the server about the progress of our order, she looked annoyed and said they were busy. She said it had been twenty minutes. It had been longer. Ten more minutes passed. I asked for bread or something. She brought some scones. Ten minutes later, she came to the table and apologized and said the error was hers. We accepted her apology and were all ready to move on. But our meals still took another fifteen minutes and my meal never arrived. After waiting two hours and watching everyone else eat, I said to forget it. The funny part was they said they wouldn't charge me for it like they were giving me a gift. Why would you charge me for something that was never served? After I pointed this out, they made other reparations on the bill, but whatever. It's good to acknowledge there was a problem, but I would have rather had someone try to get me a meal. Last but not least, after acknowledging the problem it took a full 30 minutes to settle the bill. It was inexplicable. It will be a long time before I go back after this last experience. I think the owner needs to spend some time in their restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere. Burgers and sandwiches are particularly tasty but also the only fare I've sampled. Patio opens up to the inside, nice vibe!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but the patio and atmosphere is what you are going for. They also have live music on certain nights."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and patio. Haven't ever been blown away by food or drinks. Service is a bit slow at times. Overall, a good place to meet up with friends but not a go-to if I'm trying to impress someone with a great meal."}
{"text":"It's still very new, so I'm willing to cut them some slack. 
The menu looks amazing, but I haven't had the food actually live up to the descriptions once. I ordered the Po'boy, which looked amazing, and tasted more like a frozen fish stick in a sandwich. I could've gone next door to No Frills for the same effect. 

As a nearby resident, I love the upgrade, compared to Sharkey's. The clientele is much better, and they've done a fantastic job with decor and service."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!  Wife and I had pizza here on July 4th and we're violently sick from food poisoning.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Gross. I went on Labour Day with my family and we waited 15 mins to be approached by a waitress. The drinks (beer, mimosa, coffee) were fine. The food was just disgusting. My caesar salad tasted fishy and the lettuce was limp. My mom's shrimp lettuce wraps were grey. Nothing was seasoned. My Dad ordered a vegetable sandwich with an egg on it - the wrong thing arrived, not once, but TWICE - which he eventually finally just ate because he was starving. They comped it at his request. Extremely expensive for very low quality food. This place is on the end of my parent's street, so I really want to like it, but I've been over 5 times now and every time have had the exact same experience. Kennedy, you have potential - hire a new chef and redo your menu."}
{"text":"Hairy wings anybody? I understand that chicken wings have feathers and hair but I do expect them to be removed before being served to me, particularly in this type of establishment where you pay a premium for the environment and service. I felt like I was being served discount wings with out the benefit of the discount. Server knew about the issue hut shrugged it off. They were just ok flavour wise. Service and food are generally ok here but I expected more and think they can step up the quality of the food as its a great space with a great patio."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 12. Table was reserved in advance and we were seated promptly. That was the extent of my positive experience. 

Atmosphere: Stuffy and congested. Me and my friends had to step outside multiple times because the place was a damn sauna. We sat at the long island table in middle on stools. Ridiculously uncomfortable. Everyone at our table switched the stools up for tall chairs. 

Food: I had the \"Chef's Mac n Cheese\". Don't be fooled, there is nothing appealing about this, unless you enjoy oily macaroni in cheesy pesto-ish sauce. VERY bland. Couple friends grabbed salads, and they were half-eaten. Nothing to brag about. Others walked away satisfied with their meals, but nothing they'd want to try again. 

Service: 
-Seated within a couple minutes. Great. 
-20 minutes to take our drink order
-15 minutes for those drinks to come 
-10 minutes later she asks if we want food. Ok. Takes our order. 
-30 minutes for food to arrive. By the time half our table's food arrived, the other half of our table already finished their meals. 

This place has a live band at night. Good for the ambiance, but I think the venue's a little cramped for a band, and it just makes for a loud night where no one can hear each other. But that's just my opinion and isn't part of my score. 

Overall, definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"Don't go here for brunch-- you are better off going to mcdonalds.

Service was fine- drink was ok... food not so much."}
{"text":"Popular local hangout. Awesome people, great food and good times. Family friendly yet popular for business professionals to unwind after a long day at work."}
{"text":"74% would not recommend. 

My server was JH Mackenzie. I am sitting in this restaurant while I write this.  Mistakenly I tipped 20% - and she sure didn't earn it. 

I had the Brie and bacon pizza. It needed some chillies - but she didn't come by the table to ask how the food was until we were all halfway done. 

She had dropped off a pitcher of water for our table of ten. I had to request one for our side of the table when I requested chillies. 

She brought us the pitcher - but she didn't bring the chillies. 

She then asked for it to be packed up once it got too cold to eat while I waited for the chillies. 

She's the devil. Her red hair - ginger - no soul.  

When my bill came, she charged me for the pizza. I'm all class of course so she got her 20%. But I am here writing this review to say this:

Food is 7/10
Drinks were 9/10

Service was a 2/10. 

Do not sit in this chicks section. It's easy to sport her. Red hair... Tail and pitchfork."}
{"text":"Great food & service. The food is standard gastro pub fare, but it's a friendly local spot that I will always think fondly of."}
{"text":"We visited this place for brunch on June 17, 2017. We were greeted at the reception with warmth and seated right away. The waiter Kayla was cheerful and attentive but not obtrusive. We ordered the skillet breakfast with 2 eggs, Chorizo sausage, French fries and some beans. It was the ugliest sight of all times I care to remember, Everything brown heaped on top of each other housed in a small skillet. The fries were soggy, the entire breakfast was oily and it appeared that the eggs were deep fried in the bacon fat. I could not stand the sight of this ugly preparation. Kayla knew what I was talking about and volunteered to take it back from both my wife and I and replace it with traditional bacon and eggs breakfast. Again, no colour except brown and brown, floating in oil, chorizo sausage in the form of meat balls were foul tasting and eggs, in my opinion, were fried in bacon fat, home fries were either stale or refried. All in all, the brunch was a disaster with everything fried and soggy or stale. No colour, all brown, no garnishes, no nothing. $46.78 for two with tip, taxes and coffee included. Kayla was cheerful throughout and obliging. Service gets top rating and food zilch, zero.

{"text":"I have actually been here three times with being the most recently twice in one week about three weeks ago.  

I can speak of my most recent experiences.  The first one was where made a lunch reservation for a business meeting.  The server was very accomodating.  We looked for an outlet to plug our laptops.  We actually had a business call, although being loud with some music and the chit chat from some patrons, it was still an ok environment to do our business.  Our server came around to check up on us but was very subtle respecting what we were doing.  Not ideal but it worked. 

The second time, the debit machine was down for some reason.  Our server seemed like she had an attitude.  

Overall, they have excellent items on the menu.  I had ordered pizza and hamburgers previously and they were pretty tasty.  They have a decent drink menu as well.  It does get jammed on weekends so either get there early or be prepared to wait a long time to get a table.  

Maybe the next time I will try their brunch, but definitely one of the better eating establishments of BWV."}
{"text":"Great service! If you are a fan of mushroom take the house mac n cheese! Their wine selection is average, ceasars are made with tap clamato (ew). Ambiance is good. Good selection of tapped beer (average of 7$/pint)"}
{"text":"Terrible Sangria. 90% water, no fruit, no wine... no flavour.

Tacos el pastor... 45' wait and one of the worst tacos I have ever had. 

First and last time."}
{"text":"Shirt service and over priced. I've been several times. Breakfast is shit. Dinner was plain. Let's face it not a good place to spend your money."}
{"text":"Went here with my friend, we were both incredibly hungry and honestly would have been ok eating anything so we ordered a pizza, which came to us undercooked. We asked for it to be cooked again and they seemed ok to do it. While waiting my friend and I noticed how complete shit the atmosphere was. Wait staff on their phones in plain sight behind the bar, one waitress was wearing practically nothing, half her chest was showing which was really disturbing. 
By the time we got the pizza back it still wasn't cooked all the way through so for lack of a better menu option we begrudgingly sent it back again which made the waitresses seem confused, one of them brought it back and made a snide comment about it being \"well done\" with a condescending smile. It came back burnt around the edges but raw in the middle. My friend and I quickly ate what we could of the pizza and promptly asked for the cheque as soon as we could get someone to look at us. We then waited what felt like forever just for the cheque and left as soon as it was paid. 
The wait staff that night were completely incompetent and had no sense of common decency or courtesy. No apology or anything just snippy attitudes and uncomfortable looks. All of this happened while a fly endlessly circled our table.
The whole time I was wondering how you can mess up margarita pizza but I now realize it's because 3 of the 4 pages that make up their menu are just alcohol. 
Would not recommend. Maybe their drinks are good, or at least you would hope so since they are priced at $10-$15."}
{"text":"came here with friends this weekend for brunch and it was great. i had the Chef's Breakfast and was full till dinner! the place was really busy so i suggest getting reservations if you are intending to come with a big group of people."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and have always been impressed with the food and service. But I went again last night for my birthday dinner and was beyond disappointed. 

I ordered a glass of wine. The server sheepishly told me they were out of that wine. Okay, fine.

My boyfriend inquired about the avocado sandwich. They were out of the avocado sandwich (whatever that means). Well alright then...

I ordered the halibut. THEY WERE OUT OF HALIBUT. What a joke!

The first thing the server should have done was inform us that they were out of half the menu, instead of waiting and hoping we wouldn't order the items in question. So unprofessional. Had I known I wasn't going to get the wine I wanted, and neither myself or my boyfriend would get the entrees we wanted, we would have taken our business elsewhere.

We ended up ordering the mac and cheese (always yummy) and I had the shrimp appetizer (very average). But after this experience I will never go back.

One more display of unprofessional behaviour to note: Another server standing indiscreetly in the bar area STUFFING HER FACE. I understand they need to eat, but the way she went about it was completely undignified and off-putting."}
{"text":"First of all, have a good set of lungs because it is so loud you'll be speaking over everyone and guessing what your company has to say. 
The nachos, which were recommended as one of the best in town by a couple of places, were a tremendously dull disappointment. Their chopped romaine was good, we enjoyed the extras and it is not your average ceasar salad. I would not recommend going just for that. They have an extensive drink menu - lots to choose from on tap."}
{"text":"I came here last night for dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere of the place. Looks gear on the inside and they have a nice patio. We decided to sit inside right by the patio because they had opened the doors so that you got a little bit of both!

All the waitresses were very nice and friendly. We ordered vegetable pakoras to start, which were delicious, but I thought $10 for 4 small pakoras was a bit much. 

For entees, she ordered the Kennedy Burger and I had the Mac and Cheese. Both were VERY good. I had a bite of her burger and the meat was very tasty. My mac and cheese was also delectable - waitress said it was the most popular dish they have. So creamy, I highly recommend it. Portions were very generous, I couldn't even finish my meal. 

Not sure why my Mac and cheese was $18 when her burger and fries was $16. That's my only complaint, some of the pricing.

We both decided we might come back if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"I found this place lovely. Our server was lovely! And the atmosphere was such a great environment! I loved how on the hot hot day they open up the siding beside patio so even if you aRe not sitting outside you get the nice breeze and open air. The food was delicious and huge portions! For very good pricing too! Drinks wize I was nicely surprised that it was a very good deal, some more expensive than others depending on what you get which is typical. Overall it was a lovely lunch we had! Extra points for our service giving us the option to still have brunch when it was edging close to it finishing and she let us know beforehand so wed silk be able to grab something breakfasty!"}
{"text":"First and last time diner here.

This will be prefaced with the full disclosure I am a server elsewhere and have worked in restaurants for years.  I also have to admit, I had heard good things about the Kennedy so was expecting quite a treat.  Perhaps I set the bar too high?

I went with 3 others and two kids on a Sunday evening with a reservation.  No wait, no fuss, seated immediately.  Our server came over, took drink orders, brought back drinks for those who ordered and (sorry to her) we ended up asking for more.  No problem there, very accomodating with taking the order, offered up the helpful warning that the Duck entree  was actually a pasta (my wife didn't realize).  We still went with it.  (Please keep in mind this 'helpful' exchange.)

The poutine was shared as an app, and was great.  The drinks were pretty good too.  When I finished mine, I ordered a beer to go with my meal...  Unfortunately it never arrived. From this point on in the evening, she dropped off our food and didn't re-appear until we were ready to leave.

Which unfortunately did the meal in.  Other people on here have spoken about the duck Bucatini and how good it is.  We obviously had different people preparing it.  Of the 4 adults THREE ordered the duck (not me) and each tasted like someone had dropped an entire box of salt in it.   It was inedible.  My chicken with the cornbread was pretty tasty, and since there were four pieces of that, everyone took a piece and shared.

If she had returned to actually check to see how the meal was, we could have changed it quickly without issue.  Unfortunately four adults ended up sharing a (admittedly delicious) poutine, leftover kids meal fries, and one order of fried chicken for dinner. 

When the server arrived to check on it we informed her about the duck, and she was very apologetic, handled it well, offered to get something in exchange, but unfortunately this was too little too late, since we had waited quite a while (and of course the kids were being kids) so we declined.  She came back with the bill as we asked and had deducted the food (which I hadn't asked for but appreciated.)  I'm pretty sure the kids meals we had ordered technically came with dessert, but this wasn't offered.

I had prefaced ALL of my criticisms about the food with how I understood the flavor wasn't her fault and wanted to make it clear that I wasn't upset with her about the taste.  The deal breaker was (and I'm paraphrasing here) when we were told that unfortunately their \"A-Level\" cook wasn't in the kitchen this evening and she wouldn't have recommended the duck tonight.  Huh?  Meaning, you knew that 3/4 of our guests were going to be underwhelmed, said nothing when you had a chance, and THEN threw the cook under the bus?  And your restaurant knowingly hires poor cooks, AND serves awful food to guests?  Let's face it, passing the blame on wasn't really her best option here, particularly considering she was not blameless in the situation.

I have a sneaking suspicion that if I went back, had a different server, and a different cook things would have gone swimmingly.  Unfortunately thanks to this experience, it will remain suspicion."}
{"text":"I came here this past weekend for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and although the food was nothing to complain about, we both agreed we had the worst service of our lives. Aside from the table being strangely sticky, our server simply \"forgot\" that we had ordered our entrees, so after an hour of wondering where our food was, we let her know we were still waiting and she denied that we had ordered it in a very rude tone. Toward the end of our meal, said server left without telling us or switching us off to another server. No one would come bring us our bill, so we might as well have dined and dashed! However, we have more courtesy than that, so we tracked down another server who then also was rude to us as we asked for our bill. Not planning on returning! (The two stars is only because the food was good and the live band was very talented)."}
{"text":"Pictures of the patio got my attention so I decided to stop in for brunch. Well the patio was even nicer in person, however the metal chairs weren't particularly comfortable. The server was very nice and friendly, and I was able to make a substitution on my order no problem. The $6 Cesar was a great size! The meal I ordered was good, but not great. The chorizo was a bit tough and the potatoes were over-seasoned. The price is also a bit higher than average for brunch. Overall, it was a decent meal. Probably not memorable for the food, but definitely memorable for that patio."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming back here.  I guess because it's in my neighborhood and convenient. They change the menu all the time but it still always overpriced and the food has become mediocre. Wine is so overpriced as well. The service is hit and miss.  I have to get over it and stop coming here."}
{"text":"Went here for bunch with 3 friends on Saturday around 11am.  Waiting a very long time for our food despite the fact that the restaurant was basically empty.  Once our food came out the food was cold!  All 4 dishes.  We had to send it back.  It was barely heated up and given back.  The manager was our server and apologized but did nothing beyond that.  Food was mediocre. Paid full price, didn't even comp our coffees.  I've worked in the industry for a long time and expected more.  Unfortunately we will not go back despite living in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Out of stock of wine, burgers and fish & chips. How are your doors even open?

We dropped by the Kennedy Public House yesterday to meet up with a friend, have a few drinks and a bite to eat. To be clear, it was a Sunday mid-afternoon. And there was an \"Open\" sign on the door.

We started with ordering a couple of drinks. We tried to order Pinot Grigio, your basic light afternoon wine. Since we both wanted a glass, we ordered a bottle, to be told they only had a glass and a half left in the last bottle they had. Seriously, you carry one Grigio, and you have none available. FYI, there's a liquor store across the street!

Now, let's not shoot the messenger - our server was very nice, and genuinely felt bad every time he told us they had none of what we wanted. 

Did I mention this place is largely a bar, that also offers food. Oh, and as such, you might expect clean glasses. Apparently not. The glasses our drinks were served in looked like they hadn't been washed in a week. And as I glanced across the empty tables, one look at the water glasses across the room suggested cleaning glasses isn't really something they do there - yich!

So, back to the food. I was craving fish and chips - and was told they had none.
My wife was craving a burger - and was told they had none (which was weird since 20 minutes later I saw 3 burgers being served to other patrons). 

So we were stuck ordering pulled-pork poutine - it was so average. I think poutine seems to be a kitchen's excuse to just jam anything into a bowl, and it doesn't really matter how it turns out. If you're ordering poutine, I guess you probably don't care what it tastes like - that must be what they're thinking when they make this. 

I had something called \"Baked Gringas\". And, upon reflection, I got just what the menu says: \"Chopped flat iron steak, cheddar cheese, chipotle sour cream & salsa verde wrapped in a flour tortilla\". Needless to say, it wasn't very good. If you're really hungry, you can eat this. 

These experiences leave me sad, and frankly, when they said they didn't have the food we wanted, we just should have walked out. But we were settled and who really wants to move about. But we should have. The last thing I like doing is eating lousy food that I didn't want in the first place. 

Will never return."}
{"text":"Had an atrocious experience here last night. Will never go back again and do not recommend! 

Took over an hour to get our pizza order. No apologies from the wait staff. Given an insulting comp. of $6.00 off our order when asked after another 30 minutes of waiting. 

Waitress and management did not offer any apologies and acted like this was a big hassle on their part. This is truly heartbreaking as I have been a loyal customer for almost a year now. If you want to be treated with respect, AVOID!"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks after dinner!  Hopping band and if you really feel like it you can dance around a tiny bit.  Did not eat but the food looks really good.  Will try again next time."}
{"text":"For my first time in Bloor West village, I got to try this place out, thanks to a suggestion from my friend. It's more like a bar, as the name suggests. The interior is quite nice and the ambiance of the place was fun.

At first, we both ordered an entree and also nachos for the 2 of us. The waitress politely told us that the nachos were huge and asked if we were sure that we wanted to get them. We decided to save the nachos for another time and we were glad - our entrees were more than enough!

I had the pork two way sandwich with a side of romaine salad. I really like how they offer you different sides with your sandwich - fries, two types of salads - for no extra charge. I feel that sometimes restaurants offer fries as the side, but if you want a salad they charge more! Also, these salads are smaller versions of their regular salads on the menu. So my romaine salad came with bacon, roasted artichokes, and cheese. It was sooo delicious. I love having variety with my food. The sandwich was quite good too, but messy. There was roasted pork belly and also pulled pork in it. A huge portion! They also included a small cup of coleslaw on the side. This was $15.

The washrooms are also quite clean and spacious. They have a communal sink, too.

Service was average as I think the server could have been friendlier. Overall a good experience, though, because of the food. I definitely want to come back again and try their nachos as an entree to be shared!"}
{"text":"Why do I like this place? It's so loud at times you have to YELL to have a conversation yet I keep returning whenever I'm in the area.   This visit occurred on a Thursday--we came specifically for $5 martini's and to listen to the DJ who got us moving in our seats when he started his set with Prince's Raspberry beret--nice choice.  

We ordered the Duck bucatini and chicken nachos.  The duck was impressive with roasted garlic and caramelized onions.  The garlic/onions didn't overpower the duck but gave the dish an delicious savory flavor.  

The nachos, were serviceable--the portion size was enormous--more than enough to share between several people.  Service was a bit slow but we were so well entertained by the DJ we hardly noticed.  Martini's were a good deal for $5 the lemon drop and strawberry rhubarb we ordered were well prepared--the bartender knows her stuff."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now with friends, normally on a Friday or Saturday night.  All times I've called to see about reservations, being told they're full but to stop by anyway.  All times we have stopped by because we were walking by & been given a seat no problem...don't know if that's good luck or what but makes me happy.  Unfortunately a lot of people probably don't go if they're told the same thing.
The food & drink has always been pretty good.  The drinks are pricier than some other places but the beer is on par.  I had the steak & tomato salad when I was there last & it was pretty delicious.  Everyone else with me seemed to be content with their food as well.
One issue that was not cool was a few of us ladies went to the washroom & NONE of the toilets were in service...so that was great & we actually ended up leaving.  It was only around 9 so no clue what was going to happen when everyone starts needed them as the night went on.
It is a really loud place so be ready for that if you don't like noise, especially on nights when the band is playing & the patio doors are closed.  
It's in a convenient location, pretty consistent & my friends like it here, so I will be going back."}
{"text":"\"Meh\", I believe is the appropriate expression.  Place survives due to the limited choices in Bloor West plus the largish patio's a draw.  On the pricey side with portions on the small side, though usually the food is well prepared.  Beer selection is slight especially if you want something aside from the usual roadhouse taps.  
I've lived around here for years and, in context, it being Bloor West, there isn't a lot of choice so this review should be read as an \"OK - nothing special\".  Some competition would improve things."}
{"text":"PROS:
-Yummy drinks! Try the white freezie, really tastes like a freezie! 

-I had the classic breakfast and it was yummy. Not mind blowing but good. 

-Cool interior and great service. 

CONS:

{"text":"Came here for the brunch and did not get what I expected. The spinach in my salad was half SOGGY and tasted really weird. This dish really confused me. I wish I ordered where else"}
{"text":"This is another local pub we like to go to for a quick dinner. Food is interesting and there are twists on all the classics. The steak sandwich is absolutely delicious. Beer and wine list is very interesting & fairly reasonable. Service has been both good and bad, but mostly pretty good. Pizzas are 2 for 1 on Mondays and they are delicious.
My critique of this place is the chairs on the lounge side are unbearable. Is it just me or does anyone else have a hard time sitting on them? I am not a big person so I could imagine that the tiny little seats and no foot rests on the stools would pose a real problem for a lot of other people too. Also, the loads of children and families that make up the majority of the clientele make the atmosphere more suited for a quick dinner than a nice meal or late night drink spot. Nevertheless, we'll be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in today for lunch as a group of 4. The decor is nice and the space is big. The lady that sat us was rather unfriendly. No big deal. Our server made up for the hostess as she was cheerful and friendly. As a group we ordered the two hamburgers on the menu, the pig out sandwich and the crudo salad. The burgers were great - the cobbs sesame bun was amazing and the quality of the meat is top notch. The fries unfortunately were just adequate as half of them were soggy. The pig out sandwich looked pretty good. The crudo salad, at $14, is the size of a side salad and not worth it. I want to say rip off but that seems mean. 

The burger is worth coming back for, but with so much choice out there, I probably won't."}
{"text":"With the amazing weather today, we checked out the cherry blossoms in High Park and decided to walk up to Bloor West Village for some beer on the patio. 

Having grown up in the area, it was certainly weird seeing this bar in place of Future Bakery over the past couple years but I can definitely get behind more variety in bars and alcohol choices in any neighbourhood so I definitely wanted to give the place a shot. 

We didn't have time to wait for a seat on the patio but it did look to be a fantastic and bumping patio. With the garage doors open on the side of the bar facing Bloor St, there was a lot of natural lighting in the place and a great summery atmosphere in general. We were at the table closest to the street so we were practically on the patio too. 

When we sat down, we were immediately told of a few things which weren't available. It was nice that they told us but I was surprised at the number of items which they couldn't make - including bar staples like sweet potato fries and nachos. They also told us the kitchen was short-staffed and that food would take at least 30 minutes. All in all, it wasn't a great start to my pending review of the bar. However, the food actually ended up taking less than 15 minutes so it turned out great - good idea for them to set the expectation low and over-deliver. 

We ordered a couple pints of beer and ended up sharing the calamari dish and side fries. The calamari came with hummus, pickles, zucchini and eggplant. I must say that the combination seemed odd to me at first but it went very well together and I'm a fan of the dish. The fries were decent and so was the mayo that came with it. 

I'll definitely check this place out again when I'm back in the area, especially if it's a patio weather kind of day."}
{"text":"Visited here with coworkers on Thursday night.

A few coworkers wanted the seafood linguine. The first person's order was taken, and then the second person was told the kitchen could only make one, as they were out of the ingredients needed. 

One coworker asked for his sandwich to be made without bacon... and he was brought a sandwich with bacon.  

The food was actually tasty. The nachos were a really good portion size, visually appealing, and a hit with everyone. I asked for guacamole with the nachos and didn't receive them - later overheard a server advise they were out, but I wasn't told this at any point.

I had the mac & cheese which was loaded with a decadent mushroom sauce. 

There was one dessert option only - raspberry pie. Not sure why they wouldn't have a more commonly liked dessert if they're only going to offer one."}
{"text":"Fries and burger good. Romaine salad too heavy. Fish and chips no good. Very very loud (hard to have a conversation). Slow but friendly service. Won't go back."}
{"text":"My second visit I ended up with a stupid drink bar tender. That's the way it is . 
You never know what you get ."}
{"text":"The Kennedy is a local standby when you're pals are in town (or the hood) and you want to grab a reliable meal. They change things up periodically, but I stick to the Kennedy Burger, any of the pizzas, or the mains.

Their brunch offerings are great as well. 

Important note for those dining on the cheap: they have deals every weeknight. Monday is especially good! 2-for-1 pizzas!

Finally, I don't recommend venturing to their newer menu items. For example, some of the new sandwiches are awful. The Best in the West Steak Sandwich tastes like burnt everything. I don't recommend that."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend who told me that she has had consistently good food here on prior occasions. 

My first thought though was that the restaurant was freezing cold inside, but the atmosphere was nice and the waitress was lovely.

She told us the soup of the day, which was potato garlic and said it could be ordered as a side dish. My friend ordered the salad and the soup and I ordered the calamari sandwich and soup as the side. The sandwich had some great aioli on it and the calamari was nicely done, however I wasn't a huge fan of the bun it was in. It had a sort of sweet taste you might enjoy as a french toast, but not with something savoury and some of the calamari was a little tough. THat said, the sauces covered the taste from the bread and the texture was good and overall it was tasty.

The soup I found to have too much black pepper mixed in. The waitress asked and I mentioned and she brought back a small container with grated parmesan cheese and suggested I mix some in, because it cuts the pepper taste. 

She was right! It really helped the soup. She said she does this with soups here all the time...which I'm not sure if a very complimentary review of the soups.

My friend said her salad was great and she liked the pepper, but agreed the cheese in the soup made it better. 

So while everything was overall A-Okay, it wasn't fantastic. It's solid though and I would go back and try something else another time."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, here's my thoughts:

- The decor and seating arrangement is top notch. Love the layout, the feel, the look, the seats are comfy, just overall a great vibe.

- The food is good but a bit hit and miss. The pulled pork sliders are great, but the coleslaw they serve with it (and other dishes) is really boring. I like acidic coleslaws, but even I could make one better than this. 

The chicken wings are great, crispy, meaty.... but I made the mistake of choosing the \"cajun chili oil\" as the sauce that came on mine, and it was bland and just made them oily. Avoid that sauce and you should love the wings.

The braised chicken parpadalle was fantastic. A bit salty by the time you're done the whole thing, but really rich and flavorful.

The pizza we had was the Momo Verde. Love the crust and the fact they go really easy on the cheese, flavors were good but overall it was too dry, needed just something more to brighten the whole thing up a bit.

- The service is hit and miss as well. Food and drinks come quickly and at great temperatures, but the staff are either really friendly or kinda snotty/rude. Very weird.

- The wine list on the menu is completely wrong, most that we ordered wasn't available and wasn't going to be any more. The staff had trouble figuring out what they did and didn't have. They explained they are switching to smaller batch wines and are in a transition... that's great, I know a lot of places are doing that, but you should change the menu, or give a supplemental wine menu until new menus are in, or at the VERY least make your staff aware of what the options are. The guy we had was confused and had to make several trips to figure it out. Kind of a bummer.


Some highs and lows both times, but overall I will definitely be back. The atmosphere is great and it would be a good place to have a quiet dinner with the wife at the back, or have some wings and beer with the boys while watching the hockey game at the front.

I would give this a 3.5 but since you can't give half stars I\"ll be generous and give a 4."}
{"text":"I don't go to Bloor West Village a lot, but this place seems like a great place to hang out! It has a great patio, but not when it rains (which is what happened when we went). Luckily those guys are quick to grab those cushions from getting too wet!

So this place has an interesting feel. It has this old-new feel that everyone likes. Modern seats, black and white pictures, some old. The washrooms had the same feel, it's a shared bathroom with stalls. A shared sink in the middle. I'm always iffy on these shared sinks. I think they look great, but do I want to see what's coming off your hands floating past me in the sink? nope.

I ate an \"All Beef Classic\" burger. I could hardly tell the difference between this burger and the Kennedy burger. Apparently Kennedy burger has two extra sauces. Might make a difference, but I was satisfied with just the classic. I thought the burger itself was solid. It held together between what I assume is a Cobb's bread bun. The sauce inside didn't make it so wet. I'd eat this burger again.

Also got a try of the Spinach bacon & brie pizza. I thought this was good. But I liked the Summer Daze pizza. It has tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto and arugula. What the menu does not tell you is that it has whole cloves of garlic on top, cooked of course. Not everyone is a fan of the arugula placed on top after cooking, but I like it.

The crust has this crunchiness like a crouton, but surprisingly the ends of the pizza look kinda limp. Nevertheless, these were good eats!

So about the service, this might be a one time thing. So we got there and one waitress was helping us. Then time went by and I'm like, where'd she go? I look around some more and I see she's sitting on the bench drinking so I flag her down. She see's me and then waves at the waiter/bartender. Apparently her shift had ended, someone else was supposed to take over but they didn't know. If I hadn't waved her down we could have been sitting even longer! I'm sure it's one time.

The menu must change since it'd be odd to have Summer Daze in winter. Though I mean I guess we all dream of summer in the winter."}
{"text":"I hope to come back again to the Kennedy Public House in the near future. Prices were reasonable, food was interesting and good - with different takes on a variety of standards - drinks were good quality and well priced, and the ambiance was cozy and intimate. The service staff was a little less-than-attentive, but friendly. And the split bills, which is always a plus.

Went for dinner and had the butternut squash salad (excellent) and the PBP pizza. I had trepidation initially with the pizza (pear?) but everything worked together really well and it was fantastic.

The beer selection was standard, but the mixed drinks were a good price and well made - notably the bourbon old fashioned variation."}
{"text":"We ordered the nachos and wings figuring you couldn't go wrong. The dips that came with the nachos tasted a little funky, and since they didn't have sour cream they offered us \"housemade\" dill flavoured sour cream instead. Both my boyfriend and I got stomach sick the next day after eating here. Avoid!!!!"}
{"text":"The Mac and Cheese is overpriced. Portion size is TOO small.

Hostess is very attractive."}
{"text":"I decided to check out this gastro pub with my meetup group. The place has a modern decor to it while still attached to its heritage. The wall are decorated with photographs of the area long before modernization, but remember, Canada is not old, so the photographs are from early 20th century. The bathrooms are unisex with a common hand washing station - again, a modern touch and quite lovely.

I ordered the Kennedy lager which was light and refreshing, and the grilled chicken tandoori sandwich. It was well cooked - still tender and juicy and the tandoori marinade only added to the flavour. It came with chutney, which unfortunately no longer recall what type. But it was complemented the tandoori. The sandwich can get a bit messy given the amount of food in between the bread slices. You've been warned! The dish comes with chicken fritters (overkill), a coleslaw served in one of those small butter dishes, and I ordered fries. It was delicious and filling.

The other meetup members ordered the steak and tomatoe salad, and judging by the dish and their reactions, I am ordering it next time. 

All in all, if I lived in the area, this would be my neighbourhood pub!"}
{"text":"The menu is trying a bit too hard to be trendy and missing regular decent food. There is nothing on the menu that is overly appealing.  I got a dish of seasonal vegetables that turned out essentially to be a garlicky bowl of Brussels sprouts, broccoli and cauliflower.  There are many more appealing seasonal vegetables in Ontario outside of this trio of yuck.  My mac and cheese was filled with mushrooms but quite greasy.  I would not rush back any time soon."}
{"text":"We did not have a good experience at Kennedy this past Sunday. 

We arrived for brunch just after 1. It was busy but not packed. We ordered the French toast and a club. When the club arrived we noticed that the bacon on top of it was barely cooked. Pink. Raw. Gummy. We pointed it out to the waitress and she made the comment \"some people prefer it that way\". Who are these people?  Please raise your hands. 
She took the sandwich back and you can tell all they did was just - I want to write re cook but seeing as it never really was I'll just leave it as cook. The rest of the sandwich sat soaking the bread and wilted the lettuce so needless to say it wasn't any better off when it returned. (I won't get into the French toast. It was okay but hardly worth the price) At this point the waitress was obviously avoiding us so when we final caught her we just asked for our bill. 
This is actually a good spot for some drinks. Too bad the food is such a hit and miss."}
{"text":"I went for brunch today and they must have had a management or kitchen change in the past six months.  Disappointing, both in quality of food and menu options.  The service was good but the food was maybe one step up from a mediocre hotel breakfast.  I ordered a kid's meal for my daughter, it was huge and the homefries were overly spiced for a children's option.  Bacon was completely dry.  My \"huevos rancheros\" had only one egg and was overly soggy.   In general I was disappointed.  Will likely not return."}
{"text":"The location is great and the staff is decent but the food is just not good. Not good. BUT if you are just looking for a drink (especially an overpriced drink), then it's a fine spot. The decor is very lovely, especially on a sunny day.  The best reason to go there is if they have live music. And you've eaten dinner beforehand."}
{"text":"Went back last week and remain in love with this place. This time we made reservations and sat in their dining area. Thursdays are $5 Martini's and they fill a crown royale glass halfway so you get your money's worth. This time I had their butternut squash salad and it was fantastic! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The Kennedy Public House is a step up from your typical pub that serves fish n chips, burgers, wings, and nachos.  IT does have those types of things, along with several additional salads, fish, mac n cheese, and some decent sides.

It is a relaxing place to come for a casual dinner, meet friends, or watch sports at the bar.  The Kennedy also has a nice patio area.

Here are the high points....

1. The food is good, but not great.  The one great thing is that the place is consistent across the board.  Everything is good, but nothing is great.  If you like a burger, get a burger.  If you like a salad, get a salad.  The other thing you considered won't be something ten times better you missed out on.  Go with what you feel.

2. Service is slow.  The bar especially bogs down on $5 cocktail nights, when the cocktail glasses barely reach half full.  Food comes out of the kitchen at a fair pace, but the table service is far from stellar.

3. The KPH has a nice list of cocktails and a great selection of beer.  AS a place to grab a beer and some nachos and sit at/near the bar, KPH is really quite good.

4.  Overall this place is 3 and 1/2 stars."}

( another 40 mins) no real apology and no compensation for serious inconvenience ( and beer all over by husband ) never coming back . After this visit confirms my suspicion they don't  value customers that much"}
{"text":"The avocado sandwich was magnificent. Wow.  I loved it. We added a fried egg on top which made it extra good.  The service was terrific as well. I will do itself be back soon."}

{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. Caesar salad was tasty and pizza was awesome. Had the spinach, bacon and brie, and also had a bite of my friend's traditional pizza. Have to say, I prefer the Kennedy pizza over Queen M. Atmosphere was good too - not too loud but still felt like a happening spot. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here a few weekends ago and it was fantastic. Highly recommend the Chef's Breakfast. That Jalapeño Blueberry Cornbread is killer. I also love the Bourbon Peach Iced Tea.

\"Happy Hour\" is 3pm-5:30pm (Tues-Fri) and its 1/2 price appetizers. $5 martinis on Thursdays too, mmm. They have some fun drinks."}
{"text":"We went to The Kennedy a few weeks ago to try it.  I quite liked it.  I had the cheeseburger, my companions had the pulled pork sandwich and the Scooby Doo pasta.  The steamed veggies that came with the kid's dish were nice and healthy but really hard (i.e. I should have asked for them to be steamed until soft).  Wine and beer were nice and cold although my husband thought a bit pricey.  Looks like there is a nice patio in the good weather.  Good atmosphere, even if you're with kids."}
{"text":"Sadly we have been repeatedly disappointed here. The last thing we ordered was the pakoras which were a mash of gross, and the veal sliders. .They don't seem to know how to make ceasars anymore unfortunately, and often we have waited ages to be served but staff who seem more interested in socializing by the kitchen. And then there's the amount of children in the place. It seems to now focus on the hipsters with kids sect, and let them run wild through the place while your trying you enjoy a martini. We aren't going again."}
{"text":"Two of us stopped in for drinks and appetizers on a Saturday evening around 7:30/8. It was busy, but not packed (i.e., several tables were available). We were seated at a table right away and given menus. The server took our drink orders, brought our drinks, and never came back. We drank slowly and chatted for about 15 minutes, but still no server. After finishing our drinks, it took us another 10 or so minutes to finally flag down our server, We ended up paying and leaving without ordering anything else. If the server had stopped by our table even once more after dropping off our drinks, we would have ordered an appetizer and probably another drink just because we were already there. The atmosphere is cozy, but the prices are high for the quality and service was very inattentive. There are plenty of other, better bar options in the Bloor West area."}
{"text":"We go there often foe drinks. It's always busy but most of the time you can find space. Two times we ordered food and both times the food was disappointing. One time it was some kind of a fish sandwich as a main meal and one time french fries as an app with the beer. The sandwich I would rate as lower than average and it is expensive and the french fries were soft and even soggy rather than crispy as I would expect from a fresh batch of fries. I would recommend this place for drinks but not for food."}
{"text":"This place was a real disappointment. Very expensive. Looks real pretty, but there are plenty of hipster bars in the area to pick from. Took forever for our waitress to take our order and then we ended up placing it with another one. 

The drinks were good, but incredibly expensive for three mouthfuls. The gin and tonic taste like your average gin and tonic, but the pear and tequila margarita was delicious. Beer was beer. 

Tacos were extremely disappointing as they were dry and under-flavoured (strange as they were the daily special). The muscles in garlic white wine sauce were tasty, but the bread was stale and untoasted, and they were tepid. The only fluids that are tepid are bodily ones!! 

Their online presence is not an accurate representation of their current menu, which was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Went there with group of friends, as there big patio got our attention. They don't have pitchers of beer so we got sangria which was without any alcohol and fruits. It took them 45 minutes to bring our food, their bread was terrible, looks like it was there from weeks. Never going back again"}
{"text":"I like this place because they have a special every night of the week. Really cheap drinks and my husband loves the fact that they have so many televisions, so he can watch the game. Reading all the reviews, I'm surprised by the number of negative reviews. You don't go here for fine dining. It's a gastropub. The food is not going to be out of this world, you have to adjust your expectations. It is solidly good every time we go. We've even been here for brunch and the food is always good. It's always packed at night, it's where the twenties and thirties crowd hangs out. Nice atmosphere to boot!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint little but famous pub in Bloor West Village. Place was fairly busy when we got there but really filled up later on in the evening. The food we decent but not outstanding. Had a couple of Steam Whistle Lagers which are always good. 

The appetizer was a standard Caesar Salad but this one was a little dry but I find most are. The main was the \"Stinky Italian\" Pizza. Had blue cheese/ Prosciutto/ green olives & lots of garlic. Delicious but a little salty. Otherwise this was a decent place with good food. It's a do-over."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, looks far better than it is. Far too expensive - like $12 for a salad of literally only greens, cucumber, and four tomatoes, drowned in dressing. Watery Caesars, overly salted soup etc. 

Staff is nice, the space is good, and the patio is great in the summer. But not at all worth the price tag."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is busy. The food was sub par. When I asked the waiter if the the kids chicken fingers were freshly made or frozen he told me fresh. Does the staff think we can't tell the difference? Won't go back."}
{"text":"This establishment has gone down hill and continues to spiral out of control. Day Staff is always sitting at the bar. Lots of their staff (but not all ) ignores patrons by chatting with each other. More often than not they are out of beers on tap and always out of food on the menu. Stay away on Thursday and Sunday evenings as that's when they have their worst staff in."}
{"text":"Kennedy Pub is no longer open. Went there just before Christmas and it was all closed up. No lights and windows papered over."}
{"text":"On the weekends they serve Brunch from 11am till 3pm. Brunch options were so so, they didn't have anything Kosher and there were no substituted available like Turkey bacon etc..Food arrived after 35 minutes and it was Disappointing. The only thing great was our waitress who continuously apologized for the food delay and topped up our coffee."}
{"text":"Great patio, good service and awesome Ceasar's! Duck Cassoulet was delicious.  Calamari was disappointing - it had no flavour and we were pretty sure it was frozen."}
{"text":"A new pub in Bloor West Village and in my opinion, BWV can always use more of those!

Met a friend for dinner on a rainy night.  Was hoping that the weather would be decent so we could take advantage of the patio but those plans were dashed.

We were seated inside at a table for two.  Noticed that they had a few long, communal tables as well.  Perused the drink menu and eyed the decent beer and booze selection.  Pints, mixed drinks and martinis all priced between $7 - $7.75.

Food-wise, I chose the Calarmari Po'Boy sandwich with fries ($13) and DC chose the Pulled Pork pizza ($15).   

I'm not a huge fan of sandwiches, and I usually have lowered expectations for them.  When the bread is super hard or gross, I'll just pick out the innards with my fork to eat and leave the bread behind.  

I was actually pleasantly surprised by the Po'Boy!  Size was not monstrous, the bun was super soft and crusty (I think it came from Cobbs across the street).  The calamari pieces were lightly breaded with a tasty peppery coating and it was not rubbery or fishy at all.  Sandwich came with a side of Canjun dipping oil but I think a squeeze of fresh lemon would have been perfect.

Pulled pork pizza looked great as well with enough leftovers for next day's lunch.

Service was friendly and attentive.  

Kennedy Public House is a nice addition to the BWV strip.  I'll be back to try that patio!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Kennedy Public House eight times for lunch, each time with an entire table of mom's with strollers and young babies. The staff have been very accommodating to all our gear and our (sometimes) noisy children. 

They have pizzas, meal-sized salads, sandwiches, and full entrees. I have had the steak and tomato salad three times, and each time it arrives a bit differently with meat of varying doneness.  They serve fried artichokes on top, which is perhaps the best part. 

Avoid the steak sandwich unless you want to eat it with a fork and knife, the meat is far too thick for chewing through and attempts at it make for a disgusting show of mastication for your dining partners.  The mac n cheese with dried porcini mushroom is a miss in my books - i felt like i had drank a cup of cream after - not enough depth of flavour. 

Kid-friendly? During the day, it's all a go. They are waiting on a delivery of a change table for the unisex washrooms, which feature the loudest hand dryer known to man."}
{"text":"Bar Crawl #4: Kennedy Lager ($6) and Kronenberg Blanc ($7.75)

Love the set up and the deco of Kennedy Public House. The Communal tables set up at the bar area are just perfect for big groups!

Drink menu is quite diversified including imports/local wines and beers. There are even some interesting mixed drinks (Martinis and Cocktails) from $8.50.

On this snowy Saturday evening, there was even a live band!"}
{"text":"I agree that KPH is a big step up from Sharkey's.  It's a great place for a late afternoon pint and solid food.  The menu was full of appealing choices that would fulfil appetites of those looking for substantial pub food or lighter fare.  

I had the calamari po'boy with house salad and was very impressed: the calamari was tender, had the right amount of breading to be served on a sandwich, and they nailed the chewy-crusty French bread (from Cobbs) that a po'boy needs to be a po'boy.  There was a mildly hot cajun dipping oil that cut through the dryness of the sandwich really well.  

I was happily surprised at the quality of the house salad--roasted macadamia nuts, a nice pear dressing, etc.--definitely above and beyond the standard-issue \"fistful of greens from a bulk salad container\" sides you typically get at restaurants.  A side salad this nice makes abandoning fries a preference, not a health-minded compromise.

Bffff got the special, a pan-fried pickerel, which came with some good-looking veggies--a couple of thick slices of corn on the cob were a nice addition.

The service was friendly and prompt--nothing remarkable to report, which is usually a good thing.   The restaurant is not trying too hard to individuate itself much from an image perspective: it's a nice, modern pub decor-wise.  There's a really nice patio on the west side of the restaurant--a vestige of the venue's Sharkey's past--likely one of the draws that kept Sharkey's going.   The draw with Kennedy Public House, however, is the great food--and I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I was just there tonight and I really enjoyed the evening. The price was fair and the food was REALLY good. I had the Kennedy Club and it was one of the better club sandwiches I've ever had! Our waitress was really friendly and didn't seem to mind that we were slow to order. Overall it was just a great experience.

My only complaint would be it was a little loud for my taste. As the night went on the it got noticeably louder to the point where it was hard to hear across the table. It's not going to keep me away, but maybe I'll try a different time (we were there 8-11pm).

Definitely going to be heading back here!"}
{"text":"The Kennedy is typically the spot I recommend if I have to meet a friend close to the subway in Bloor West Village.  Food is OK, they have a decent beer selection but all are extremely overpriced (happy hour specials are a good deal, though!)!  That being said, staff are friendly, and you can't beat the patio in the summertime, as well as the location, so I'll likely be back again."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food however I really enjoy the space for drinks.  It is modern, spacious and easy to talk in.  I've caught the live music on a Saturday once and the band was actually really good - covering a a huge amount of music in vastly different genres spot on.  Great choice to hang out in the west end."}
{"text":"Out of our first wine choice. Cocktails were decent. The food was very disappointing. I've been to this place 3 times before and the food was always great. This time, dry flavourless burgers, overly salty and garlicky mac and cheese (I love salt and garlic but it was too much). The pork tacos were also dry and bland, and the soft taco shells they were served on were soggy and fell apart when you tried to pick them up. The fish and chips....just meh. The waitress-who was also the bartender didn't check on us until we were about done....we just ate the food because we were starving. We were honest with the server and did get a 15% discount on the food, but we won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Looks like a nice place. They had a lot of seat available but supposedly they were all reserved. They weren't so accommodating about where I wanted to sit. Ordered food and after 45 mins still didn't come out.  So I paid for my drink and was about to leave when the manager rushed out my calamari appetizer and said it's free on the house because it took too long.  So it kind of made up for it a bit..."}
