{"text":"It was overly priced for food that looked like it sat there all day! Dry meat and not a lot of choices! I couldn't even make a decent salad! Worried about even trying the fish and the deserts looked gross!"}
{"text":"Hostess Heydi was rude and wouldn't even make eye contact when I asked her a question. She presented as if she was annoyed that I was even asking a question. Server Myriam asked us for our drinks, brought them and then proceeded to serve everyone around us, except us! I had to track her down to re-order my drink. Then, as we were planning our activities for the day, we lingered at the table. The place was empty and they kept staring at our table and talking. They weren't closing for another 45 minutes, so I know it wasn't that they were waiting on us. I asked my best friend if he noticed what I had noticed, and he he agreed. We have always enjoyed coming here but now, we will be going to other places thanks to the poor customer service of Heydi and Myriam."}
{"text":"A Vegas buffet is usually average at best, at a typical pricing range ($15-$25). Plate is that with some above average food and a nice Modern atmosphere. Regular prices are $15/$20 for adult and $10/$15 for up to 10 year olds. With 25% off via Player's Card, and points. It was about 50% off the total. ($7.50/adult). The variety is average with some nice touches (the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Sunday September 28th 2014,We visited the buffet for the champagne brunch which included crab legs, I feel it was a great deal for the price. I had the crab legs, roasted turkey, potatoes, fresh fruit, loved the garlic bread it was toasty like a crouton but delicious, my opinion.  The mimosa's were great and the waitress brought them out 2 at a time. I finished with a slice of cheese cake I believe it was raspberry or blueberry that was delicious too."}
{"text":"One star because the brunch is do-able with the DONUTS!!! But otherwise, forgettable....and quite regrettable."}
{"text":"I don't know about other reviewers, but I had an excellent time here.. We have all major cuisine from the world like Mexican Italian Chinese American ... All the way from soups salads, carving station , burritos, tacos lasagna , Mac and cheese .. Innovative salads, breads, dressings and sides .. I am very choosy when it comes to taste.. Here my search ended.. Good for dinner .. Have a vast variety in desserts , even the sugar free ones..   Do try this restaurant... Don't go for others review ... The only thing missing here is piZza for which am a great fan... And of course an extra large stomach"}
{"text":"None of the food was exceptionally tasty except the mexican selections and the macaroni salad. It was just an average buffet. Desert was  a little disappointing. I just nibbled on some cookies. It was a nice attempt but needs to be updated"}
{"text":"Came in hungry and leaving hungry. Horrible food. Everything they are serving is old. Stay away! Better to go eat at the restaurants than to step a foot in here."}
{"text":"Vu qu'on passait quelques nuits à la Stratosphère c'est le premier buffet que l'on a essayé lors de notre séjour à Las Vegas  Rien n'est réellement mauvais mais dès que vous aurez essayé un des autres buffets vous aurez vite fait d'oublier celui-ci tant les propositions sont banales et peu variées... Surtout qu'au final il n'est pas beaucoup moins cher (comptez 15$ par personne pour le breakfast)  A noter que cet avis se base sur un test d'il y a deux ans, cela a pu changer depuis, mais je n'en suis pas sûr vu certains avis anglais..."}
{"text":"They were very rude ! They were watching us eat and you have to pay $21 for it ! I don't recommend going here ! Rip off and invasion of privacy !!"}
{"text":"i thought this buffet was one of the best ive had. unfortunately we didnt even know it existed untilo our last day in the hotel. the stratosphere advertises their 50's diner like crazy (which we were very unimpressed with) i didnt see one single sign that advertised the buffet, the directory leading to it happened to catch my eye as we were checking out wondering where to go to eat, we went there and everything tasted really good. there wasnt one thing we put on our plates that we didnt enjoy. and i thought the service was nice. and this was on a monday morning"}
{"text":"it was really reasonable. i stayed here one night so i didn't have any expectation on this buffet. however I really recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Saturday. I enjoyed drinking bottomless mimosas and the great service that bobby provided. He kept the mimosas coming!!BUT the food lacked flavor. They also didn't have a variety of foods. I mean you get what you pay for..I paid 20 which is much cheaper than other buffets. Would I come back? No I wouldn't. I recommend you go to a different buffet and avoid this one. The only reason I came here was because I was staying at this hotel and wanted to give it a try."}
{"text":"3.5 rounded to 4 stars. No wait on a Friday evening and 25% off with the ACE Rewards card (free signup) brought the total down to about $15 each (also a great deal for a Friday night buffet).  The food was very fresh at the time we went (5pm so it had just opened). Everything from cold cuts, to salads, and even cold cereals if you're in the mood. Plus the usuals like Mexican, Asian, Italian, and American fare. Carving station had semi-decent prime rib, and the desserts were okay.  Not the greatest, nor the worst per a few reviews had stated. I guess if you feel like spending close to three times as much across the street at Wynn, that's your choice. But if I'm going to spend $40+ on dinner, it sure isn't going to be at a buffet, no matter how good it is."}
{"text":"My family ate here for dinner. What a mistake! One of the hotel employees said it was no good and we thought, \"it can't be that bad\". Should have listened.  The selection was limited and the taste was disappointing. Everyone tried a few plates of different food types but couldn't finish any of them. One positive- my 11 year old liked the mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Unlimited eating for $30 per day. Go to Belagio buffet for lunch at 3pm instead. $20. Much better. \"}
{"text":"It's not bed, u can not hv this many selections at this rate, and the food is decent, with great meat and a lot of vegetables"}
{"text":"This place was dead at dinner time. We should have known what awaited us. It was hospital food--flavorless and depressing."}
{"text":"I am not a buffet connoisseur by any means. I did enjoy this buffet. The food was good with a good selection. I had the champagne breakfast. Wasn't in the mood to drink after the night before, but because I was forced to pay for it, I had a couple of bubbly champagnes."}
{"text":"Very bland, had one to two bites of everthing I put on my plate. I made a ceasar salad, and it was the best out of all the different foods I tried. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Nothing is super fresh. Seating was okay, drink service was friendly. Other patrons were loud, lots of kids. Not really somewhere I'd go again or recommend to others."}
{"text":"I gave three stars for the food. It was pretty average for a buffet, decent price compared to other Vegas buffets I suppose. The roast beef was pretty tough but I enjoyed the prime rib, especially since I got the last thick slice of it which made it really enjoyable. It's clearly more about volume than quality.  However, I gave the extra star to them for their customer service. All of their servers and chefs and busers had excellent service. Friendly, courteous, and with a touch of humor at that."}
{"text":"You definitely get what you pay for here: good quality comfort food. We came to the stratosphere to go up to the observation deck. After seeing everything we wanted to see we decided to eat at the buffet for the first time. Me and my wife were both surprised on how clean the buffet was and how good all the food was, nice,fresh and hot. Even the service was excellent. We will definitely be visiting the buffet at the stratosphere again."}
{"text":"I would go as far as saying this could be the worst buffet in Vegas... Food dry, over cooked, and over seasoned... When I  paid $16.99 i was only paying for the costumer service so that's why I gave a star!"}
{"text":"I really don't like this buffet.   Even the chinese buffet near the gas station is better than this one. This one is nothing related to your LV buffet fantasy.   One thing interesting, you could only get juices through waiter."}
{"text":"Food was old and wrinkly. Came out of the place hungry because there was nothing fresh to eat. This is the last time I will visit the buffet.   Before the renovation, this place was decent. Maybe worth 3 stars. After the renovation, this buffet sunk to the worst in Vegas. Would not recommend!!"}
{"text":"Worst buffet in Las Vegas  The Stratosphere as a hotel is what it is: decidedly average, geared toward the guest trying to enjoy Vegas on the cheap. The Courtyard Buffet should be an affront to any guest's sensibilities. It is undeniably the worst buffet in a city loaded with buffets, and one of the worst I have ever experienced. I only ate at the buffet because I had a free voucher as part of a promotion.   I felt very alone in the dining room surrounded by the host of aged gamblers and tacky tourists taking a break from the tables and slots and eat their one meal of the day; they seemed more interested in the Keno numbers than the slop on their plates. I cannot blame them for liking the food; I am not sure that anyone of them knew better. I would never eat here again--even if it were free. None of the food was fresh and nothing was palatable."}
{"text":"Misinformation at Ticketing and Groupon Buffets not honored  This is the second hotel along with Treasure Island that did not honor buffets that were reserved on the phone and in person which were booked through Groupon. Paid $200 + Tax for Buffet and Show for 4 people.  I called and was told to come around 9pm and book in person, when I did i was then told by ticketing booth that buffet is after the show.  Show was 9:30 and ended around 10:45 and much to my surprise and embarassment to my guests, the buffet was closed!  The management at ticketing booth downgraded us to the Roxy's Diner for burgers only and we were then turned away by another manager there.  It was more embarassing having gone inside and be turned away.  When I went back to ticketing booth all i got was SORRY WERE NOT ABLE TO HONOR THE BUFFET OR ACCOMMODATE IF THE DINER HAS ALREADY TURNED YOU AWAY.  It became a lively debate and people were looking, another manager said she'll try to email higher personnel to get an approval for us to go back to the DOWNGRADED DINNER AT ROXY'S DINER, made it seem like she was doing us a favor.  I was already done ready to go and just write bad reviews as well as inform Groupon of all the inconveniences we received from these two hotels not honoring and misinforming us over the phone when we booked with them directly."}
{"text":"Das erste Mal in Las Vegas, das erste Mal in den USA - und was macht man in den USA? Mampfen! Und zwar bei einem ordentlichen Büfett. Das The Bufett war im Erdgeschoss unseres Hotels, wir mussten also nicht weit laufen und hatten daher auch eine leichte Entscheidung, hier hin zu gehen.  Der Preis betrug soweit ich mich erinnere 15 US-Dollar pro Person. Es gibt auf jeden Fall günstigere Büfetts in Las Vegas, aber für das Geld wird eine Menge geboten. Vor allem natürlich zum American Breakfast. Die Speisen werden alle zügig aufgefüllt, außerdem füllen nette Mitarbeiter stetig Getränke nach. Amerikaner werden diesen Laden sicherlich anders bewerten, aber ich habe dort gut und viel gegessen. :)"}
{"text":"Nice buffet, good value for money, Came here for brunch. Lots of selection. Cakes,breakfast foods and some other items like Chinese, tacos etc. Good service and recommended."}
{"text":"We've stopped by Vegas for a night and stayed at Stratospher.  We ate At the hotel's buffet.  The food was very fresh ans although it wasn't espetacular, it was well prepared and delicious.  It had a good selection of good stuff but stay away from Chinese station."}
{"text":"We ate at the Buffet at the Stratosphere for dinner twice while we were in Vegas.  The first time was on Thanksgiving day.  The place was PACKED.  The poor waiter couldn't keep up with bussing tables, filling drinks and clearing plates.  The food selection is decent.  If you get a Player card, you get 10% off.  The next time we went, it was on Sunday after Thanksgiving.  What a difference.  We got there about 9:00 PM and the place was pretty empty and we pretty much had the buffet to ourselves which was nice.  The buffet included a baked potato bar, pasta bar, taco bar, nacho bar, salads, desserts, etc.  The carvery included prime rib, roast beef and turkey.  The asian food available was okay, not realy that great but okay."}
{"text":"They had a good selection of food and our server was great. Price was fair for what they have. I got my moneys worth."}
{"text":"Definitely not a gourmet las vegas buffet. Average at its best. If you have kids it is fine otherwise spend a few more dollars and go somehwhere else.."}
{"text":"Dinner buffet....HORRID!!!  Only thing that was descent about this buffet was the soda.  Thank goodness we did not have to pay.  I would caution anyone about eating here, especially if you have to pay for it.  Everything I sampled was disgusting or had some strange taste, like the melted cheese for nachos.  How do you mess up melted cheese?  Oh wait, the carnitas taco that you make yourself were tolerable....but everything else was so disappointing.  If I were given passes again I would throw them away, I wouldn't even torture someone by giving them away.  Spare yourself!!!"}
{"text":"The buffet is great - good variety! all the food is really good - but not FANTASTIC. Worth your money! We did a 24 hour day pass for $29.99 you can go in an out as much as you like - drinks included (no alcohol) so from 7AM to 10PM you can go in as much as you want.   The variety is great - mexican, soul, italian, etc. Lots of meat and veggie options.  Best decision we made - good for food spending."}
{"text":"This actually used to be a pretty decent buffet many years ago. Don't know what happened.  Mediocre to the max.  Pros are that the service is very good and there's a self-serving soda fountain which is very convenient since you don't have to wait on the waiter to refill your drink. There's also never a line, but there's also a reason for that."}
{"text":"Breakfast is $20, but some nice lady clued us in on saving $5 if you sign up on the Stratosphere's Ace Play card at the Player's counter.  That's what we did.  10 min later, saved us $10.  There was no wait at either the player's counter nor The Buffet line.  Must mean something.  This place is very ordinary even though they served snow crab legs during breakfast.  It served it's purpose for the day.  Since we were riding the roller coasters on top of the stratosphere, it was a one-stop shopping place.  I can't see any other reason to eat here."}
{"text":"I like eating in casino buffets as I feel like I'm beating the casinos at the money game and getting one over on them as I don't gamble. I had worked up a good appetite on my 2 visits to the Courtyard buffet at the Stratosphere!  The normal dinner buffet is $14.95 but they have special seafood nights at $18.95. The lines on this visit were both short and it didn't take long to be seated.  There's a good variety of food ranging from American favourites to oriental and Mexican fare. There's a good amount of meat for carnivores at the carvery - prime rib, brisket of beef, roast chicken, roast turkey. On seafood nights, you can have as much shrimp, oysters and crab legs that you can manage. Sodas are available on tap. There was a good selection of cakes and ice cream but I stuck to the fruit, especially the lovely selection of melon.  Despite passing on salads and other 'fillers' and concentrating on the entrees I love, I still end up eating too much but a nice rare feeling of getting one over the casino as I leave the buffet!  I think the Courtyard is a reasonbaly priced buffet with a nice selection of food."}
{"text":"I came here for the breakfast buffet which was really delicious, but I wasn't very pleased with the dinner buffet."}
{"text":"This buffet was worth it. For anyone looking for food. Came in at around brunch time. Food options were pretty much good, nothing crazy amazing I can remember, (besides bacon), but nothing I hated. All you can eat of course so why get mad? Unless everything is terrible. Orange juice was really good. We have a server that picks up our dirty plates and is attentive to our drinks. So that's good. Worth it for the money. 3 of 5 because it wasn't memorable or exhilarating. But not 1 because food is usually food unless it's terrible."}
{"text":"Really not bad as hotel buffets in Vegas go.....  Relatively inexpensive, not much of a line, decent selection and, for buffet food, not bad."}
{"text":"kinda confused about the bad reviews.  So it's not some $60 buffet, but it is damn good for the price.  I went for lunch one day...best part was there chinese food, roast beef and clam chowder.  Then....sunday brunch...where do I start.  I had all you can eat crab legs and champagne.  I couldnt be happier.  The crab was big and meaty.  Yum..so upset I dont have that nearby.  Chinese was good again.  Only thing was they had krispy kreme doughnets and they were cold.  No good but a good buffet and I will be back.  Oh yes...good servers tool"}
{"text":"Do NOT eat breakfast here, husband and I came for brunch paid 21.99....to expensive for the mediocre food...deserts were old, food was bland, nothing to rave about...better off eating in the Diner located in the Casino....perhaps the lunch or dinner is better??"}
{"text":"It is just okay. It was not as bad as other reviews, but not the best on strip. We got 25% off for signing up for a PLAY card.   The omelet bar is probably the best thing here besides unlimited crab legs and mimosa. I left full, so I'm happy."}
{"text":"THE absolute worst place I've eaten in as long as I can remember. Some friends and I had free passes given to us by a manager at the hotel so we decided to try it out... Yuck! I had a bite of French toast and literally spit it out, the nastiest I've ever eaten. I figured the dessert bar couldn't be bad considering most of desserts aren't actually made but instead taken out to thaw out... Wrong! I found one dessert I liked and I have no clue what it was but it had a little candy button on it. The place needs an entire redo on their cooking staff Bc it sucked more than any place I've eaten before. Save yourself the trip and go anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"The food quality was just okay. It wasn't bad by any means, but you can go to other higher quality buffets in town. The bananas foster however was pretty good. As for the other desserts, my sprinkles on my yogurt tasted Luke garlic salt... I was begging people for gum for the next few hours."}
{"text":"Only if you're starving. At 16.95 too much $ for this food that seems to have sat out too long. Everything is hot but dry and tasteless. I would have clicked less than one star, but not available- RUN the other way."}
{"text":"I was back at the Stratosphere Buffett last week.  No real changes to food quality.  I can only assume the cheap poor food quality is profitable as it has not changed over the years.  For free and convenient I'll do it but I do not recommend it.  Especially with all the wonderful food choices in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Way too expensive considering the food is not so great! I expected a lot more for it being the Stratosphere!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review before, but I had to write one for this buffet.  I got the tickets free for visiting some resort, and thought I'd check it out for brunch.   Selection was minimal, and the carving station was closed.  I love buffets and rarely find nothing that I like. I didn't finish a single piece of food here. I'm not sure how some people are rating this at 4-5 stars, but do not come here, it barely passes as edible.   I wouldn't come here if they'd payed me money to."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. I have spent the last 30 years visiting buffets in Las Vegas, and this ranks as one of the lowest on my list. The food selection is very poor considering the price. For a few dollars more, one can savor the tastes at a quality buffet, or for the same quality, should be able to find something much less expensive. I have been to the Courtyard Buffet on a number of occasions over the past few years, and the only reason I would go there by choice would be the result of a comp. Even the dessert bar is lacking. Many of the selections were either dry or lacking in taste. Some were both. The pizza crust? was very chewy and rather tasteless. Unless it were free food, I'd move along. There's nothing to see here."}
{"text":"This place was just ok.  Approx. $15 for breakfast buffet.  I have had better but I guess how bad can you screw up breakfast?  It wasn't very crowded and the service was just ok.  Never stayed or been to the Strasophere before so didn't know what to expect.  If you are staying at the hotel and don't feel like leaving, it is there and is ok.  Nothing to brag about.  I am not a big breakfast eater so it was a bit of a waste of money for me."}
{"text":"We received a coupon to try this place upon signing up for the Stratosphere club, so we figured why not try it. Worse mistake of the trip. I usually write lengthy reviews, but this will be short.  The cost, even with the coupon, was way too much, the food was mediocre at best and we were sat by a screaming child, even though the restaurant was mostly empty. When asked to be moved to be able to relax, they moved us over 2 tables, approximately 10 ft. Ugh never again"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! Breakfast was the best breakfast buffet I've had in a very long time. Definitely would recommend it to anyone wanting a good variety."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here during our recent trip to Vegas.  We were staying in the hotel and were given a coupon when we checked in.  There was a pretty big selection of foods available however none of it tasted very fresh.  The ribs were too tough to chew, the egg rolls were mushy and lacked any actual meat inside, the pastas were over cooked , and the black forest cake was the worst I have ever eaten.  Our server seemed out of it, she couldn't seem to remember our drink orders even though we were just a table of two and there were only 4 or 5 other tables seated in her section, and come on its a buffet so bringing the drinks is about the only thing they have to do.  The only thing I really did like were the pot stickers- I have a soft spot for pot stickers.  Overall I've had worse but I've definitely had better too, much better.  I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Good is actually pretty legit. The have breakfast and lunch til 4pm. If you have the hangover munchies and don't wanna travel far stop by here. Bring your players card and get 25% off the $20 price tag.   They have \"make it yourself\" omelets, regular breakfast selections, Asian cuisine, taco bar, basic dessert selection, and free refills on mimosa's.   On a personal note, try wrapping a piece of watermelon in bacon, it will change your perspective on life =)"}
{"text":"In a town that is second to none for buffet choices, I would advise all who read this to make another choice.   They're not even trying. Seems the Stratosphere is far enough south of Fremont St., and far enough North of Wynn Dr. that they can charge for the worst (Casino) buffet in Vegas. If you're at the Strat and looking for a buffet, you'll probably settle.  The variety of offerings is fine, but everything seems to have been there too long. In the center where the desserts are is a door for employees to get in and out. On a table, where patrons cannot go, were really nice looking oversized slices of Boston Creme Pie. We laughed, and figured the staff had squirreled away the only item worth eating in the whole joint.  There are a thousand better choices in Vegas.  For the same $15 lunch price, the Palms has a much more appetizing buffet a couple miles away on Flamingo."}
{"text":"We have been at Vagas for 2 weeks and have eaten at many buffets. The one at our hotel (stratosphere) was by far the worse. Limited selection and food was just so-so. Would not recommend it. The feast buffet at red rock casino is really tasty and a great bargain"}
{"text":"Horrible dirty very old you have to see the dishes they have the food in cracked black very old and dirty looking. Very low end buffet. The bread for breakfast they have still in the bags you buy it in they don't even take the bread out of the bags and place the bread in a platter everyone's dirty germy hands are in and out of the bags. I didn't enjoy anything the donuts even tasted stale extremely disappointing thank goodness it's was only 16 bucks a person.  The service was good and it did fill the hunger void, but not someplace would ever want to come back too."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that the circus circus buffet gets a slightly lower rating than the stratosphere buffet.  Circus isn't that far away, and offers better food IMHO.  The strat breakfast had crumbly powdered eggs, hard-boiled eggs Benedict, and not much meat that wasn't deep fried.  They did offer crab legs (not really my cup o' tea) and the corned beef has was pretty good, but we all know that comes pre-made.    Some would argue that even a bad buffet is a pretty good deal for $23, but considering the Wynn lunch buffet is only a few bucks more, and worlds apart in terms of quality and variety, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Seriously don't know why people are shitting on this place. It's actually quite great! What a gem.   We were a little scared coming here since the price is astronomically cheaper than all other buffets in vegas, especially this xmas weekend (all buffets DOUBLE in price, this one doesn't). So at $16/pp you don't think the quality will be great, but you're wrong.  Yeah, there wasn't a huge selection, but I can't eat too much nowadays, so it's not like it really matters anyways. What they did have for brunch was a nice assortment of foods which I enjoyed so much. The desserts were also quite delicious and everyone was nice. Best of all, this place was on the emptier side, so no having to push and shove or wait in lines for anything.  I do highly suggest, especially if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"Food was just decent. Not enough variety for the price, compared to other buffets. Probably won't return again."}
{"text":"For their buffet price, I'd give them a 4. Lots of dishes and pastries to choose from me. Spacious place and pretty neat. Staff was always going around checking on finished plates to pick up to clear up our tables and so we can get new plates of food. lol"}
{"text":"The buffet was pretty good. Not as many choices but okay for me. The place was real clean and well furnished and lit.   The cucumbers and tomatoes were good, as well as the lo mein.   The price of the buffet is mid range and some discounts offered with club card."}
{"text":"Came here a few times when I stayed with friends. The lines were never too long and I believe there's a good reason. The quality of the food used to be great quality but eventually like most Vegas buffets, become very disappointing.  The place is huge and there's tons of dining tables but reduced staff to help and attend to patrons.    Plates were never cleared which made it difficult to enjoy our meal.  I honestly haven't been here in a while and always joke with friends and family as we pass by thinking we've enjoyed this buffet and hotel when it was in its prime.  I know the Stratosphere is pushing a new ad campaign so I'm hoping things change. Maybe one day I'll revisit this buffet and be blown away but for now, I'm content with providing a 3 star rating.  I will add that he majority of my visits here I was fortunate to have my meals comped."}
{"text":"For the life of me, I don't understand the negative reviews of this place. Sure, it's no Bacchanal, but you're not paying Bacchanal prices, either! We went for brunch on a Sunday, and it was better than both the Mirage and Mandalay Bay buffets, without a doubt!   Wide variety of food- they have a station with breakfast breads and pastries, a fresh egg/omelette station, as well as a vast array of other foods: Chinese (fried rice was awesome), Mexican, Italian (decent lasagna), and a carving station with turkey and ham. They had plenty of crab legs available, although they are cold, and I prefer them warm. There's a huge dessert island with lots of different cakes, pies, cookies, and tarts. I particularly enjoyed the tiramisu!   Service was awesome. Our waiter was the most pleasant server I've ever had at ANY buffet. He kept the drinks filled, including the mimosas- which I found to be especially tasty, and I'm not a champagne fan. Empty plates were removed quickly, and this place was BUSY. There was a high school basketball tournament in town the weekend we were there, and despite the crowds, this place was clean, well-stocked, and service was friendly.   If you have an Ace Play card, you get 10% off. So for less than $40, you get an excellent brunch with crab legs and mimosas... how can you really complain? If you want high end food with Prime Rib and Lobster- this isn't your place- go down the Strip and pay twice or three times as much. But if you like GOOD, hot, and tasty food with great service, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Every decision must be made in the context of an alternative. If your alternative is combing the hills of Croatia in search of edible plant scraps or standing in a 1970s era Soviet bread line, then this buffet's endless flow of greasy micro-portions will indeed be heaven on earth. But a civilized person will take a dim view of being herded like cattle amidst screaming children, shuffling tourists, and indifferent hosts who will let people cut in front of you. Or the contrivance of a waiter, as if to say you are trusted to create your own Frankenstein meal concoctions until your stomach ruptures but not to get your own silverware or drinks; please tip generously. Speaking of money, don't stubbornly try to get your $21's worth through repeat sorties to the French Toast pile. It's a battle you can't win, and as everywhere in Vegas, the house has stacked the deck. As a Stratosphere guest you are never more than a two minute drunken stagger away from several barely-okay food options. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"I overheard it was closed until December. We didn't even bother trying to make our way into the buffet. I'm glad I didn't after reading the reviews. Very sad I didn't get the vegas buffet experience but if this was in comparison to hometown buffet I'll gladly pass..."}
{"text":"There wasn't anything here I actually enjoyed.  I'm not a food snob but much of the food was cold, the meat at the carving station was so overdone they were having problems slicing it and pretty much everything was bland. The waiter was attentive and my glass was always full, so there's an upside. Honestly not worth the money, even if my company was paying. Eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"Excellent food selection and preparation.      Delicious crab legs, perfect eggs Benedict and incredible Mexican food station (best chicken tamales EVER and menudo!), awesome desserts ....Sundays $20. Champagne included."}
{"text":"I'm going to provide an update to my review, as I visited this buffet again on Friday, December 22 at about 12noon with a party of two.  I was lured back in with a Buy 1, Get 1 coupon.    My rating pretty much remains the same, and my opinions unchanged about this buffet.    Here is the issue:  I don't find this to be a \"bad\" buffet.  I thought the food was \"average\"; however, in the world of Vegas buffets, there are a lot of inspiring and great buffets.  Is this one less expensive?  Yes!  However, we have to remember that sometimes \"cheap\" doesn't fit the bill.  Sometimes, \"Value\" is what you are looking for.    I believe the buffet area got a \"visual update\" since I was last here; however, the food really didn't get the upgraded status."}
{"text":"Won a free buffet with my players card, so we went for dinner one evening. Service decent, the selection was alright. The veggies were really fresh, however the salad bar selection was lacking in variety. The mashed potatoes were da bomb- shocker for a buffet, but these were really good. Ribs- meh. Prime Rib- OK selection overall was good. Closes at 10pm."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever eating at this location.So many other good buffets that are a lot better than this one. Several different stations of different food stations throughout the buffet area.I would have to say that the only thing I really enjoyed was the craving station.The had a Tri-Tip steak and it was delicious,along with some mashed potatoes and gravy and a corn on the cob.  The salad bar was in two different area's of the Buffet.Fresh fruit on side and the other side had all the condiments for your salad on the other side.  The desert station was in the middle and their where a lot of different desert's.My favorite where the cupcakes and the carrot cake.  The Buffet came with all you can eat and your choice of beverage.Alcohol was an additional cost   The Buffet cost $19.95 per person and if you had a rewards card from Stratosphere and enough points you could receive 25 percent off.  The employees that are working the floor where very nice and very attentive."}
{"text":"I probably expect too much from a buffet that is visited by tourists from all over the world. I dont know, maybe it is just me. I was there a couple weeks ago and honestly i didn't like it at all.  Salads are okay. Desserts are okay, but not really.  American food wasn't good, I only liked the ribs.  Mexican/Hispanic is just horrible!!  Pastas/Asian food/pizza... in can go somewhere else and eat better and probably pay less, but price is not important when you get good food which I didn't get here and don't. Like the customer service at all.  I do not know, but the quality of the food is just veryyy bad.   Do not waste your money or time.   ** And I've been here a couple times and everytime there is always something that is worse than the previous visits. .."}
{"text":"Yuk!  Yuk!  Yuk!  I went hear with a friend for lunch and the food was gross beyond belief.  This was the second worse buffet I have ever been to (the 1st is the one at Buffalo Bills).  I am not kidding when I say that you can eat better food from a can.  I would rather eat dog food, than the food served here.  What a joke.  And the prices are ridiculous!  I think lunch was $16.99!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with many of the reviews here. Sam's Town Buffet has more food choices for half the price."}
{"text":"This buffet isn't bad at all...honestly. There was a wide variety of food to choose from. $19.99 per person for a weekday dinner, I got full PLUS my family and I did not encounter any stomach problems. So that's a good thing, right?? =)  Perhaps I'm not spoiled when it comes to buffets. I don't care about crab legs, clams or any of those \"expensive luxurious\" food because it'll all gonna come out of your system anyways. ;) *ahem...tmi...i know* I'm a simple kind of girl when it comes to food. Give me the simple stuff....pizza, spaghetti, eggrolls, sushi, soup, salad, bbq sausage, red velvet cake, cupcakes, cookies. Seriously...food is just food. I rather spend my $30+ that some of these newer buffets are charging on a mini shopping spree. =)"}
{"text":"We went in for breakfast at around 11 am, I was initially a bit worried about them switching to lunch only but to my surprise, the breakfast goes on along with lunch untill 4pm. The eggs, menudo and tamales were horrible, the salmont was fairly decent, desserts section had nothing special. The mimosas, champagne, coffe and soft drinks are included with free refills. The staff is ok and very attentive. Overall 2 stars because of convenience and price. If you can, avoid this place and go to  Ruby's dinner, not a buffet but portions are large and food is awesome."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I went through a wormhole before coming to this place or if all the other reviewers are just super picky. I came here with my partner during the week of Christmas. We were staying at the Stratosphere and wanted to try a buffet, but unbeknownst to us, every buffet jacks their price up during Christmas week. Luckily The Buffet didn't increase its price at all, it was very cheap comparatively, and it was right down stairs.  I read the reviews on Yelp and it greatly deterred us from going right away. We discussed where to go if not here, but after much debate still decided to go with Stratosphere's buffet. We walked in cautiously, expecting it to smell, or have poop covering the walls, or for there to be awful people eating there after reading the awful reviews. Fortunately there was none of that. The place was relatively empty and everyone eating there looked normal.   A server quickly arrived at our table to take our drink order. I got a cranberry juice. I got up for the food and immediately walked over to the breakfast (we went for the brunch). Breakfast food is number 1 in my book. I'll admit that The Buffet doesn't have the largest variety of breakfast food, but what they did have was some pretty nice choices.  I grabbed a biscuit, threw a sausage patty on top (patties over links for me) and then smothered it in biscuit gravy. I took a scoop of the chorizo + scrambled egg combo, picked up some French toast, rested an eggs Benedict on my plate, and then piled on the bacon. When I got back to my seat there was a my giant cup of cranberry juice.  The sausage and chorizo was great. The eggs were a little over cooked (common at buffets) but the chorizo had tons of flavor. The eggs Benedict was delicious! The hollandaise sauce wasn't too overpowering and it didn't have a funky taste to it like I sometimes get. It was creamy and the egg was perfectly poached. When I stabbed it all the yolk poured out. The French toast was a little bland and it wasn't fluffy. Needless to say I wasn't a fan of that. The bacon was perfectly cooked to my taste. Not rubbery and not too crispy where it tastes like a salt lick. My definite favorite was the biscuits and gravy. The biscuit was soft with a crispy outside and the gravy was rich with that smoky flavor in it. The sausage patty that I put on top just completed the combo and made it a favorite for me. I immediately ran back up and grabbed seconds of everything I liked.  After having seconds of the breakfast food I scouted the lunch/dinner food. There was much more variety when it came to that, but still not huge amount. A lot of the food looked tasty, but because I was already three-quarters full, I had to pick and choose. The mac and cheese looked good, and I got some ham. The mac and cheese was tasty, but very typical (nothing wrong with that) but the ham was too dry. It was a little leathery which was most likely from it sitting out and no one eating it due to there not being a lot of people.  I can't say I ate a lot of dessert, but I grabbed a cookie and cake. Both were very typical and average. They had a good amount of choice surprisingly along with an ice cream machine. My partner loved the desserts and had a huge plate full of them.  Overall I thought the buffet was great. It had a the most affordable price at the time when compared to other buffets, the breakfast food was delicious, and the whole place was pretty clean. It lacked in variety though. I walked away sickeningly stuffed and very happy with our decision to give it a try. If you're on a budget and you're not picky like everyone else seems to be then definitely give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Food is pretty standard buffet food, but the price is great. If you are looking for a great Sunday brunch come here. 19 dollars for bottomless mimosas and good food. If you get an ace play card and you're a first time fard holder the cost is only 16. Good value. Especially when you spend so much money in vegas, it's nice to save a few bucks."}
{"text":"I would not touch this Buffett at the Stratosphere with a eight-foot pole stick.  I eaten here  for free  two times because i get comp offers at the Stratosphere. While the service here is good, the same can't be said for the food. Most things look distasteful and as if it has been out in the open for a few hours. Besides the buffet prices aren't even that cheap considering the quality of the food.   You want breakfast food? Go to the diner on the main floor or head on up to the McDonalds in the second floor!"}
{"text":"The carnitas tasted like pulled pork, very scrumptious, deserts included bananas foster, cakes galore, and clam chowder was nice. It's all good when your on a budget."}
{"text":"It was ok. Nothing to special the food was a hit or a miss ."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to be lazy and come here for breakfast around 9:30 am on a Sunday. I'm a vegan so this was a very tough choice for me since I knew I'd be super limited and be paying $21.99 for basically fruit, toast, and potatoes.   I was pleasantly suprised though - I was able to get some steel cut oatmeal with brown sugar and granola on top, breakfast potatoes loaded with onions, bell peppers, guac, and salsa as well as a plate-ful of fresh fruit and sourdough toast. The meal came with unlimited champagne but I didn't drink. If you do - you'll definitely get your money's worth. The way I see  it - if we had gone somewhere like a divey diner I would've spent the same amount, possibly more, if I ordered seperate sides and orange juice/coffee. The wait staff was nice, she brought us our coffee and orange juice, as well as champagne for my friend.  They offer EVERYTHING from breakfast to crab legs to pastries to cookies to pasta to burritos to salads. It's an overwhelming amount of food.  If you're vegan, and in a pinch - this will do. Just load up on carbs and you'll be okay."}
{"text":"We stayed at another hotel over the 4th of July weekend.  We stopped here to eat because we read that the food here is pretty good for the price.  The buffet price at other hotels on the strip is a lot more and they raised up the price due to the holiday weekend.    We were completely surprised by the quality and variety of food here.  The service was excellent and our server was super friendly.  Just based on our experience dining here, we will probably choose to stay here the next time we come back to Vegas.  We paid $40 bucks per person to dine at a hotel on a strip and the food was terrible and the staffs seemed stressed.  We paid less than half the price to eat here and we were satisfied and left happy."}
{"text":"I came to the Stratosphere for my 17th wedding anniversary. I had \"free Buffet\" tickets - however, when we showed up we found out that it was \"Specialty night\" and had to pay a $5 surcharge per person. Sadly the \"specialty\" was seafood - a food \"specialty\" I loathe to order even at a fine dining establishment. Unfortunately, that was my only option. Our \"server\" asked us what we wanted to drink and then told us to grab a plate and get some food, no small talk, no 'enjoy your meal'.  I do not eat shellfish, most especially not in a buffet style setting where other people are picking through the food and there is no way to gauge the freshness of the entrees - I did try some tuna - and found there was ONE way to judge the freshness of the meal - it was dry, overcooked and basically unedible. Everything I tried was a huge disappointment and nothing warranted a trip back for seconds. I thought a dessert might be alright - but all of the toppings were stiff and stale. Most of the desserts were served in tiny plastic cups that were impossible to eat out of. I believe the only good to come of my experience is that I now know one place I need not bother recommending to others."}
{"text":"Every hotel in this town has to have one...  The buffet at the Strat isn't very big, and it's not making any gourmet claims, but it covers most of the bases at dinner: a modest carving station, a small Mexican, Asian, and Italian section, and American stuff like mac & cheese, bbq ribs, and the like.   The hotel seems aimed at a middle aged Midwestern crowd, and this buffet is dialed in to that. It's quality food that isn't fussy, and it's at least half the price of the high end buffets on the strip. So it delivered what I expected, and I'd go back."}
{"text":"Came here for the buffet around lunchtime. Decent food for the price (~mid $20 dollars range). Great assortment of food. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I love buffets. I visit them each time I go to a casino or a hotel I stay in has one. So I've been to a lot of them.  This is hands down the worst one I have been to.  It was expensive, which I expected. The food was just gross though. It all tasted like prepackaged frozen mush. The only things that were edible was the mashed potatoes, which you almost can't mess up, the noodles from the Asian cuisine section, and a few of the desserts. Between my boyfriend and I we made a point to try basically every food available and it just kept getting worse.  The server, I think he actually was a busser, who took care of us was extremely kind though and the main reason I gave a second star. He was friendly and quick to refill our drinks and remove plates.  If you were considering coming here I would definitely suggest going to one of the other restaurants in the building."}
{"text":"WOW and no not in a good way. This place was really bad. The staff was really nice don;t get me wrong but the food was like leftovers from 2 days ago. We visited this buffet last year in May and I hope they have improved since then. We won;t ever find out because we aren't going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Do NOT....I repeat do NOT eat here.  The food is the absolute worst quality you can get in Vegas even though its not that cheap.  We went for the breakfast buffet.  Everything that was supposed to be hot (sausage, bacon, pancakes, french toast, etc.)  was ice cold.  The quality of everyting was so bad in fact  that I kept askiing my guest where could they possibly get such low quality food.   It's bland, tastless and as previously mentioned not hot when its supposed to be!   Thank GOD I talked my guest out of getting a all day pass to this horrible place ($20) because I cannot imagine how bad dinner must be.  Stay away - you'll be better off somewhere else...even if it's McDonalds."}
{"text":"It is a buffet.  Selections were eh.  They didn't have the seafood selections I am accustomed to at buffets in Vegas... the crab legs, smoked salmon, and prawns:)  But for the price you pay, one can't complain.  Its under $20/pp.  I blame this judgment call on eating at their buffet to laziness.  Too lazy to drive out elsewhere at that moment in time.    Service was ok.  She was attentive.  The place looked clean and well maintained.  My palate as well as my cravings were just not satisfied at all."}
{"text":"We went to the buffet our first night staying at the stratosphere . Me and my boyfriend both thought it was absolutely disgusting. It was hard finding something that even looked semi appealing. My boyfriend definitely is not picky and even he had taken one bite of most of the stuff on his plate and couldn't take a second it was just gross. That was $50+ down the drain."}
{"text":"place seems like a hospital cafeteria: food was mediocre and the servers were really slow. if I recall, they only had 1 older gentleman as a server and we went on a Saturday night. total waste of money"}
{"text":"This was pretty disappointing, I spent $18 for mediocre breakfast and poor quality lunch. The lunch menu was worse than what I remember being served at my lunch cafeteria in middle school.  Biggest complaints:  - No lox/salmon, but they did have unappetizing deli meats?  I expected a lot better for Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"We went to the Stratosphere buffet as part of the dinner/show package deals. For only $5 more, we ate at the buffet before seeing the American Superstars show. Because of the price, I thought it would be one of the cheap buffets on the strip with a very limited selection of food items. I was pleasantly surprised at the selection and the taste of the food at the Stratosphere Buffet. Their rolled up bass fish fillet was very moist and tasty. The only drawback to this buffet was that our waiter did not come to clear our dishes until we have accumulated a small pile of dishes on our table. Other than that, it was good."}
{"text":"It was OK. Went for breakfast, nothing really exciting. It was cheap, you get what you pay for.  Runny scrambled eggs, overcooked poached egg, flavorless Bearnaise sauce and had to saw through my English muffin.  Ordered mimosa (not included with meal). Server freaked out and wanted cash on the spot...I'm guessing they get a lot of chew and screws."}
{"text":"You know people must still be drunk when they rate this place anything over 3 stars. I'm giving it a two because of the awesome service we had from our waiter.  The food is pretty terrible. Don't get me wrong, there are a plethora of options here. It's just that very little of it is any good at all. As in rubbery, old, tired, barely being able to be passed off as edible food. The salad and the super sweet and sticky chicken wings were my favorites out of this delightful meal. The carving lady (must have lost her job as the cafeteria lunch lady) did me a real favor when she cut me the most anemic piece of steak. Must have been saving the rest for tomorrow's buffet.  Only come here if you are extremely hungry and have absolutely no concern about taste or quality."}
{"text":"I went for dinner back in March, around 6PM. It was mediocre. I didn't have anything really terrible, but nothing was amazing either. I wish that my drink had been refilled more often, but that's my only real complaint. They had a good variety of food, so whatever you are in the mood for they'll probably have. None of the food that I had was really dry or flavorless like other reviewers have mentioned, but again, I went shortly after opening. I felt a little sick afterwards, but I think that's because I was STARVING when we got there and waaaaay overate. So that's my own fault and probably isn't a reflection of the food.  I probably wouldn't go back for dinner, but I might try their brunch. It's convenient if you're staying at the Stratosphere, but I don't see any reason to eat here if you aren't. Also, make sure you get the Ace Card for the discount (as everyone else has said)."}
{"text":"I am sad to read all the bad reviews for this place, but come on I had an amazing experience here!    After eating at the Circus Circus buffet the prior day this place was golden.  The servers were friendly and the food was absolutely delicious!  They have anything and everything you could want to eat!  The fruit is fabulous (watermelon so so sweet!), the donuts were yummy, the breakfast foods were scrumptious, the soup was awesome, and pretty much everything else was delicious!  The desserts were so pretty but I was too full to try them!  Although the people in my party said the chocolate cake and cookies were delicious!    If the buffet seems too expensive, get an ace card and that will get you like 25% off your buffet.  I think you need to give it a try and you may have an awesome experience.  We went on a Thursday so it wasn't as expensive as a weekend buffet, but try it and you will most likely love it!"}
{"text":"If your in the hotel or casino and looking for a decent meal than this will do. Food is okay just typical buffet food at a decent price."}
{"text":"We took the deuce down the strip and ended up at Stratosphere early in the morning...not expecting to stay long we ended up hanging out here for several hours.  We joined the ace club and won a free buffet so we obviously had to try it out.  We didn't eat dinner because it was so early but we did get \"brunch.\"  It was not bad at all.  I wasn't expecting it to be nearly as good as Monte Carlo but it actually wasn't too far behind it.  The variety of food was excellent and the dessert bar was actually better than the other buffet's in town that we experienced.  Honestly, I may have liked it because it was free though...I tend to like things better depending on my mood and the price.  I do remember loving the bananas foster!!!  The one thing I thought was disturbing that has nothing to do with the stratosphere was I seen two different people filling their purses with food.  Very shocking."}
{"text":"Food is horrible 10/10 do not recommend. Also in the picture they have for google maps it shows they have crab legs which is why I went there and they only serve them for 10 to 12 2 days a week. They suck. Food sucks. Do not go here"}
{"text":"Decent buffet. We went for brunch. Nice selection of food for breakfast or lunch. Its not super big but there are enough items to choose from to satisfy whatever you may have a taste for. Very clean with good service.  Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Not good at all!! Went there for dinner tonight!!! Most stuff that is suppose to be hot was at best luke warm. A baked potato was cold. Couldn't even melt the butter I put on it!!! The strip steak at the carving station was cold and really tough! The best thing I can say about it was the salad bar was ok! My husband had the bread pudding with whiskey sauce and he liked that but the sugar free desserts didn't look appealing at all. Never again!!! Save your money!"}
{"text":"One of the most affordable, large buffets on the strip! It has a good selection of cuisines you'll want to stock up on for the long walks on the strip! Bon Apatite"}
{"text":"This is actually my third time eating at this buffet & wasn't satisfied with the variety of food choices also it wasn't tasty like before maybe new chefs if they want competition with other casinos they need to improve a lot not only wasn't the food good my boyfriend & I were gonna have dessert but there were a few flies on it bad environment that's why there rating is 2 1/2 that explains it the only good thing about Stratosphere is nice rooms"}
{"text":"My husband and I always come here the morning we're leaving vegas.  Why? Mainly because we're too cheap and don't have a dime to spend on extravagant buffets. Plus, if you have the Ace Card you get 25% Off and you can use the points on your card to deduct the amount.  The second reason is I like their Egg Benedict. =P   Honestly, don't all buffets serve eggs, pancakes and such in the morning anyways? How can any other buffets make better eggs? EXTRA SPIT PLEASE?!?!  I don't dare come here for dinner though! =P"}
{"text":"During our stay at the stratosphere we got to try out the crafted buffet for lunch.  Food was pretty decent!  Lots of variety to choose from.  I'm a mashed potato lover and there's was on point. My daughter and niece said the fried chicken was really good.  My least favorite thing was the eggs Benedict but everyone's taste is different.  I loved all the fresh fruits     Buffet was clean and service was good.  Kids 5 and under eat free and it was 15$ for the brunch.  So much food you would definitely have to go a few times to try most of it.  Can't wait to try it during dinner hours next time!  Use your players card to receive discounts!!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced for unlimited Crab Legs & Champagne. The staff is super friendly and loss with the bubbly. The food is all on the average side nothing screamed out at me but I was quite satisfied. I was quite happy to see they had Minnie Fruit Tarts.... I love me some fruit tarts. I think that and the Strawberries and whip cream mad it worth it for me. We went for the weekend brunch so it had breakfast and lunch options, which I enjoyed. The only thing there was none of was pasta choices but there was pizza. I could see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"Was craving a breakfast buffet at 11am and all the others were switched to lunch. Lots of selection for the price and the majority of the food was good. Made to order omelets was an added bonus. Minus for no Belgium waffles."}
{"text":"I would never go back to this place.  The food was dry and not good.  Not worth the $25 I paid"}
{"text":"Service is good here HOWEVER , the food has been sitting out wayyyy to long. Instead of changing it out, they just add on mixing the old with the new.   I have been to this place twice. The variety is better on the weekend. I came on a Sunday, there were crab legs, steak, fresh fruit etc. I went the next day paid $10 less and was left with burnt pancakes and under cooked salty potatoes."}
{"text":"We had our dinner here 2 weeks ago for my birthday. Foods are not worth the price. The foods are simple and salty. The white rice that we had was uncooked. The fried rice that we had was super salty. The pasta that they served tastes like the ones from costco. But, I can say that the servers were nice."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect definition of average in every way. Which begs the question \"when in Vegas, why go average?\" It's brimming with all your typical fixins' in a buffet, with tons of filler trough of corn, mash potatoes, bread, soups, and salads. And I can't help myself but to gorge on this stuff when I really should be doubling down on the expensive meats. Though even the expensive meats are average. Sure there's shrimp, beef, and even crab legs. But I swear that these creatures were at best average in life at the bottom of the ocean, spending most of the days watching Netflix, and still living in their parent's basement in their mid 30's. At least, based on taste, that's what I'm assuming. I won't lie, I went back for 2nds, 3rd, and 4ths. It's a buffet. You'll hate yourself more if you didn't."}
{"text":"Cheap. Totally get what you pay for. Buffet was your standard cheap buffet. And it's definitely in the ghetto."}
{"text":"The buffet wasn't great- and we didn't even have to pay because it was comped by the hotel so I shouldn't really complain.  It was just \"OK\" food, I've had better for sure.  Others who said that hot items weren't kept hot were dead on... we actually read the Yelp reviews before heading to dinner but we figured if we got there right as the dinner buffet started (4pm) we would get the food while it was hot and freash. No such luck.  The Bread Pudding was REALLY GOOD though!"}
{"text":"This buffet was the worst buffet I have ever had in Las Vegas.  I took the family - dad, sister, brother-in-law, nieces and nephews.  They had never eaten at a buffet in Vegas before and we had just been up the Stratosphere tower to see the sights and enjoy the rides.  That was a great experience.  The buffet was just the opposite.    First of all, it was $20 per adult and $15 per child.  Not too extravagant but I was expecting a much better meal.  The place was clean and the server was efficient, but it all comes down to the food.    Terrible, awful, disgusting.  The prime rib was chewy and tasteless.  There was no shrimp, crab legs, or any kind of shell fish.  The deserts tasted like they had been sitting out for days if not weeks.  All the food was bland.  I don't have the words.  The chicken Marsala was so tough and dry I couldn't cut it with my knife.  I could go on and on.  We made the most of it by inventing a contest to see who could produce the worst food at the buffet.  Needless to say we all won - the only thing I won in Vegas last weekend!"}
{"text":"The seafood night was atrocious. You are paying for the snow crab alone, the other selections are either prepared hours before they are served out or the ingredients are suspect. I've had several meals up until this point in Vegas and I honestly feel like Ive wasted my money by attempting to eat here. The staff is great though.."}
{"text":"I think the description of 3-starts (\"A-OK\") is appropriate. Honestly, this place isn't bad. Stopped in for a late breakfast with the family. Some things were fresher than others, some things had more flavor than others. The only \"bad\" thing on my plate was the \"breakfast burritos,\" which were actually breakfast egg rolls, and were a little gross. But it was overall decent breakfast; and at $16/person, it was a fairly reasonable price. Also the coffee was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here on a weeknight. I was worried the food would be cold, as it was after 7:30pm, but this wasn't the case. Is this a buffet that specializes in fine dining and exotic food? No-but it also doesn't claim to be.  There were several dishes to choose from, for several different ethnic groups, and it was good! Not out of this world amazing but good. My daughter couldn't get over how good the Low Mein was.   Service was really great, and not once did I eat anything that lacked flavor or was cold.   Tip: Sign up for a player card at the casino to get a discount!"}
{"text":"Don't like the service it took me over 10 minutes to get a refill on my beverage each time the workers came by it looked like they did their best to avoid eye contact I would never come here again. Food isn't much better either all the meats I tried were dry and flavorless, the dessert was the only positive thing that came out of this buffet. Do yourself a favor and go to Luxor's buffet long line but they have such a selection"}
{"text":"I honestly didn't expect to be impressed. The food was okay, it wasn't clear about what was vegetarian which would be helpful although I know the majority of people here are coming for the meat. The price is too high for this quality of food and it doesn't seem worth it. It just seemed like cafeteria style food."}
{"text":"Large selection of food, but everything was so bland that it was barely edible. Would not recommend this buffet. Too many more in Vegas to choose from."}
{"text":"The unlimited mimosas make it bearable.  The eggs are powdered and disgusting.  I was excited for the crab legs, and they were great. The 'melted butter' was not butter. It stared to harden and I dipped a piece of crab meat in it and suddenly tasted like powdered gelatin. I literally almost vomited. The crab legs also had a waxy substance all over the outside of them as well as a slimy gray substance coating them.  I mean, I still ate them, but it was kind of gross.   But, unlimited mimosas."}
{"text":"I have had better food at Golden Corral. My buffet was free, so based on that, it wasn't so bad. I ate a few items that you normally wouldn't see in a buffet, but over all, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"By far the only restaurant I have been to that does not have a restroom inside. I had to walk out of the buffet and to the casino to find the nearest restroom. It was an absolute inconvenience to walk around the casino trying to look for a restroom nearby. Other than that the staff was alright, nothing special here. My suggestion is build a restroom IN the RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"It's true that there was enough good-looking food to make four trips, but out of the four, let's say one trip the food was just not worth taking a second bite. The best part was dessert, nothing to write home about though. The look of the place the restaurant decor and earthy color scheme to the casino floor and even the parking structure-all of it screams \"has been\". I felt too bad for the nearly geriatric staff to keep hassling them for refills and napkins. There just wasn't enough staff there or a more effective way of getting things to and away from the table. If this is what Las Vegas has to offer in terms of buffets, I'll just stick to Southern California where it's not only cheaper, but there is no comparison between quality and service."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding! One of the best buffets in the area. Waiters was very nice and kept our drinks full the entire time. Do not know if they do military discounts."}
{"text":"We've been to this buffet a couple of times during our stays at the Stratosphere.  The decor is nothing spectacular, and the service at the front desk isn't always the most welcoming, but the price is good, and the options are plentiful. The quality of the food is not always the greatest and not everything gets replenished frequently leading to some very stale food.  Overall, our service has always been good, we get our plates removed, and our drinks refilled without having to ask which is a plus.  There are several stations to choose from and a nice variety of desserts including an ice cream machine.  Don't expect to be amazed by anything here, but the price is reasonable and the food is not bad.  You can get 25% off by signing up for the player's card, so sign up just for that!"}
{"text":"I dined here basically out of convenience during a stay at The Stratosphere. It was an odd contrast from dining at Top of The World the night before. Vegas is big on buffets so I wanted to give several a try and figured I should include this one. I would liken this buffet to Golden Corral. It's not like anything was awful or inedible, but the food is basically flavorless and boring. I'll categorize this as you can find better in Vegas if you're willing to spend a little more (Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal)."}
{"text":"Good food, good variety. We have only eaten there once as we have only stayed at Stratosphere once. It's a bad part of town at night. We were approached by a street level hooker at the nearby gas station when we stopped in for a soda. Sure lady, come shower in our room...NOT. If it weren't for the bad area we would stay there again. But this is about the buffet. We had breakfast. It was good and affordable."}
{"text":"The buffet was a huge disappointment as was most of my stratosphere experience. If it weren't for the thrill rides I'm sure this place would go under. Shitty room, poor service, over priced and shitty food. Buffet food was for the most part overcooked. Chicken so dry it wasn't edible. Most staff barely spoke English. Bent forks. The manager is delusional and thinks it's great. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The worst buffet I have ever tried. It was too expensive for what I had. Everything was just cold and terrible. The hotel was nice except for the buffet."}
{"text":"I heard that the Stratosphere had revamped it's buffet. I thought it would be a good time to give it a try since I had two free buffet passes. The last time I was here all I can remember were their desserts . It wasn't because they were good...it was because the cake slices were hard like toast! I was hoping that wouldn't be the case this time.   The Buffet was pretty good but I would suggest you don't eat any of the Asian food because they don't do a good job with it. My husband was happy they had a Nacho bar that won him over quickly! I liked that they had a baked potato bar because I do love a loaded potato. My husband said the carving station had three types of meat. I failed to notice because I always go straight for the prime rib. The prime rib was pretty good but a little too red.   I'm happy to say that not any of the desserts were toasty this time around. I liked the fact that they had a nice selection of sugar free options. My favorite was the apple tart which was really tasty!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded up for value.  First, I think you have to come in with regular expectations.  If you come in expecting a Four Seasons type buffet, of course you will be disappointed.  I stayed at the Stratosphere and tried the dinner buffet once ($21) at 4pm and breakfast buffet  ($18) once around 8am.    Both were totally acceptable and fine.  At dinner I tried the Mexican bar, the Chinese bar and Dessert section.  Pork tamale was flavorful, there were flour tortillas, condiments, etc.   Chinese food (fried rice, chicken wings, beef, noodles, etc.) was good---beef  and chicken were very tender (I was pleasantly surprised).  I was especially surprised by the dessert bar.  Cake was moist, as were the cookies and bread pudding.  At breakfast I tried the chorizo eggs, various types of hash, biscuit with gravy, a dollar sized pancake and french toast.  Biscuit was fairly dry but that is not a surprise at any buffet but the pancake, while not made to order, was also nicely soft.    I am frequent patron of high end buffets in LA  which cost $70-$100 per person (Four Seasons, Ritz, etc.).  Stratosphere is of course not on that level, but it IS a great bargain at $21.  If I stayed at the hotel again, I'd absolutely eat there again as well."}
{"text":"This buffet was way better than than the circus circus no doubt!  Thanks server bobby for making it enjoyable and for getting everybody to sing for my ten year old!!  The food was ok but...my favorite is the eggs benedict and the crab legs!"}
{"text":"This is the worst buffet I ever met in Vegas! The waiter and manager are extremely mean to customer s and guests.  We bought a discount ticket from TIX 4 TONIGHT for  todays brunch. The ticket is apparently wrote \"12/24--1/3  7am--10pm\"?even if a strange \"dinner only\" also printed in the ticket. We asked them to double check if it can use for bruch. TIX 4 TONIGHT told us we absolutely can use this ticket cus it printed \"12/24--1/3  7am--10pm\" as well.  PS?they are very polite to explain every ticket for us. However?when we come to the buffet restaurant?the manager and waiter there only grasp the\"dinner only\", completely ignored the \"12/24--1/3  7am--10pm\", whats more? they are in a very bad treatment and attitude to  ask us to go back ! even without a\"sorry\" or \"Merry Christmas\"! Today is 12.24!  THEY ARE FORCING THE CUSTOMOER TO TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY TO THE MISUNDERSTANDING WHICH THEY MADE WITH OTHER COMPANY!"}
{"text":"It was simply okay. The vegetables were fresh, the soups were good and service was good too. Not too much food to choose from. Very limited seafood selection which is weird. Most buffets have a seafood section that has boiled shrimp and crab legs but they didn't have anything of the sort. No pizza either which I think is odd for a buffet. Some of the food was super fresh but some tasted like they had been out for hours. The dumplings were super tough and dry and they had a very limited Asian food selection. I didn't even want to try their sushi rolls because they looked old.    Honestly, we only went because my fiancé got a free buffet being an ace play member and when we accumulated 50 additional points that day we got the 2 for free buffet deal. Free food so why not. I did enjoy the frozen yogurt bar though."}
{"text":"Went here because we were so close by and on the weekend all the other casinos seem to have Champaigne brunch, we didn't want to pay for liquor that we weren't going to drink.  Also figured with 2 good reviews out of 3, it shouldn't be bad.    Nope...it was blah!  No different than Old Country Buffet....It gets two stars for having damn good ice tea and some awesome desserts."}
{"text":"There is nothing positive to say about this buffet.  In the city where every hotel has one, I'd expect that excess competition would breed quality.  Clearly, this isn't the case.  The choices were few.  Hardly anything was very fresh.  Not a single selection stood out for it's flavor or, at least, appearance.  I usually have a hard time walking upright after leaving a buffet, but this time, I left still feeling some hunger.  I've sampled a number of buffets in Vegas over the years, and while there are some that offer much better experience than others, Courtyard buffet is the first that I would definitely avoid. There is only one reason to eat there, if you're staying at the Stratosphere, don't know your way about town, and are hungry.  I fit two and a half of the three.  While I'm somewhat familiar with Vegas, I was too hungry and tired to look around."}
{"text":"This place was leagues better than Sahara.   We were there during brunch, so it was your typical breakfast food.  The highlight was the omelette station, but there was only one guy making the omelettes and the lines were long.  Another plus was they had both sausage links AND sausage patties.  Right on.   And pork in a third form,  I was inhaling bacon like no tommorow.   I normally don't eat a lot of bacon, but when there's bacon, it's on!  By the end of the meal, I was baconed out.   I also tried the eggs benedict.   Pass on it.   There was also a Mexican food station and a Asian food station.   Pass on both.  The salad bar is always safe.  (I hope)  And the deserts seemed as if they were sitting out since last week and tasted a little stale."}
{"text":"Worst buffet experience of my life.  I personally feel like a school cafeteria is better than this place.  The food was bland and old.  We were there for dinner and the place was empty for the most part.  Apparently everyone else knew better.  We had complementary tickets so at least we didn't have to pay for this horrible food.  The taco meat wasn't even ground beef.  I couldn't really tell what kind of meat it was because it was in this greasy sauce with lots of peppers.  The bread products were all hard and old and the Asian soups were not prepared properly.  The fruit bar only had watermelon, cantaloupe and honey due.  What happened to pineapple, grapes and strawberries?  Most fruit bars at least have that.   Anyway the food was bad but they had a good selection of juices and soda."}
{"text":"The wait staff are really just bus persons to clear tables.  We were continually bothered by the continual sound of plated being cleared behind a screen that runs along one side of the buffet. Many of the \"waiters\" were dressed down and untidy, but the general area is clean."}
{"text":"A little pricey at $19.99, but I had a 25% off perk from getting a ticket to a show (Frankie Moreno - see him!) so we did dinner at the buffet.  The selection was pretty good, solid and well planned out.  The Prime Rib was VERY good as was the Chicken Marsala, though it could have been warmer.  My husband loved the sushi.  Big fan of the carrot cake, as it was moist and fresh and very well made. Over all, a solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast. Decent food for the price. It's nothing to write home about, but it's worth the few extra dollars to have variety over the other breakfast places in the hotel and nearby (Roxy's, IHOP, etc). Don't expect anything amazing and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Soooooooo, there's a lot of people eating here at this buffet.... Why? I don't know... Maybe I've been spoiled but I want to give this buffet a two thumbs down and no stars.  I sampled everything on the menu, even the prime rib(which the host told me \"if prime rib is out it's a 5 star buffet\" that was a lie).  Granted I ate here on a Monday evening, so the crab was not on the menu, but like I said, I sampled EVERY item on the buffet and was thoroughly disappointed.  Luckily I ate here for free from a timeshare presentation but I swear if you pay for this buffet you will regret it.  Everything tastes like it came out of a box...  No authentic flavors...  Don't do it, you can leave this buffet off your bucket list...."}
{"text":"Slightly above average buffet.  ( I'm not a buffet person ). The omelet bar is the best choice. And on the weekend the champagne is free."}
{"text":"Food was disappointing.....as well as the service. Not many options. You come to Vegas for gambling and buffets, at least I do,and the food was so bad. Be warned, not worth it."}
{"text":"No no no, never try this buffet. I paid 20 bucks for a dinner buffet but came out with nothing. No seafood, no donuts. Nothing special. This buffet didn't worth the money. Service was not good."}
{"text":"$20pp for all you can drink champagne and all you can eat crab legs.  I don't even care about everything else.  That gets five stars alone.  Our server was also so friendly and engaging, especially to a drunk, obnoxious group.  The crab legs were cooked well and so delicious, even better than the last buffet I visited where it was $35pp.  There may not be as many other options, but everything was still pretty tasty.  I was also a fan of the salmon and mussels."}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet is definitely worth the money. We stayed five days and wanted to try different places everyday but I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Ugh, why did I eat here!?  Oh yeah, the boyfriend wanted to (convenience).  Not necessarily the worst buffet I've ever eaten at, but too far down the list to care about how close to \"worst\" it is.  The one thing that was edible was the omelet and that is only because they made it fresh and I picked out the ingredients.  Oh, and the pre-packaged fortune cookies have great fortunes and taste pretty good.  Salad bar was easily the most pathetic I've ever seen (even OCB is better).  I went during brunch so I picked up some french toast and the boy picked up mini waffles (such a cute idea!).  The waffles were so hard they were in penetrable with a fork so the waffle pucks were tossed aside.  The french toast was pretty good, but the options for topping (questionable strawberry goop, molten 20-day-old brown liquid) weren't so hot.  Get the french toast alone.   The only reason I didn't get up and walk out was the cute baby sitting at the table next to us making eyes at me.  omgsocute.   PS-I was sick to my stomach all day after that.  Joy."}
{"text":"We got an all day pass, I like this buffet.  Good solid food, $35 all you can eat all day.  Mimosas in the morning and crab legs at night. Our drink server (Lillymae)was fantastic at what she does. It's not a very fun job but she did it well. I see no reason not to do the buffet again."}
{"text":"The only thing that, I liked about this buffet place was the seafood and the prime rib and the rest of the food was pretty good!!!"}
{"text":"Get the American Superstar and buffet package. It's a great deal.  The buffet is good, not great or bad, just good.  OK selection, good deserts, nothing noteworthy, but for the package price, I was happy.  Best buffet for me (see my \"list of Vegas Buffets\") is Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Average buffet but great omelet bar and good selection of desserts. Good price to fill you up to start your day."}
{"text":"I was starving getting of the plane and had to wait about 5 hours to check in this crappy hotel so my family had to sit in that buffet for 5 hours...and the food was eatible but I wouldn't eat there again. Just regular omelet,  burrito,  soup. There was not even small steak or something worth the price.   Water was kinda treasure since the waitress had too many people to take care of so we only had 2 cups of water and thats it for 5 hours."}
{"text":"Everything was good, soul food, Mexican, Chinese and etc. Seasons were on point! Ugh... I was stuffing myself in order to at least taste everything. The dessert was mild to me  was into all that fly stuff."}
{"text":"Could have better servers that will actually fill up ur champagne -and mimosas. Leo SUCKED but food awesome."}
{"text":"Not a big fans of buffets but this one was okay. The food didn't all taste microwaved like other buffets do. They could use a bigger selection of food. The service was decent. One star for the food being okay, one star for the service, and one star because the last buffet we had was atrocious, so this place seemed worlds better."}
{"text":"Horrible. I have eaten at almost every buffet in vegas, and this was \"the\" worst. We saw roaches crawling on the wall, food was dry and the people were very offputing.  This may be the worst Buffet in American history. If you want the dumps, runs or quirts, eat here!"}
{"text":"Honestly haven't been impressed with food options here in Vegas. This place has a lot of variety but not really tasty. Seems like they get all their food from the same place."}
{"text":"They are terrible, charge more money on Xmas and sushi was out since 6 PM , I wait lit bit then ask ppl work inside the kitchen , they told me there will be no more sushi for the night, Waiter Tony provide great service, and that is it ... Casher is not friendly at all with attitude, one star is only for the service .Its totally waste of money"}
{"text":"HOLD IT, STOP STOP STOP THE PRESS!!!! DO NOT ENTER, DO NOT CONSUME, DO NOT PARTAKE IN THIS GARBAGE. Went here because the line at Ihop across the street was way too long and it was in the hotel I'm staying. Even though other yelp reviews said it was bad, I figured how bad could it really be. Well well well all those bad reviews were on point. The day before I went to the buffet at Caesars palace which is one of the top ranked in Vegas and it lived up to the hype. Needless to say I did not come here thinking they would compare.  1)First all other hotels give discount to their guest at the buffet, except for these guys. It was only $20 but after the garbage they served. They should charge no more than $5, maybe even free. 2) All of their food is either out of a can, bag or box. There are no chefs their and you can tell by taste and presentation that the food was not prepared by any chef. 3) OLD FOOD, AS IN A FEW DAYS OLD AND REHEATED. You can tell by looks, texture and taste the food is more than a day old. The food is supposed to be fresh but you won't find that here. 4) Lack of staff, there is one person in the entire buffet to attend all the tables. This little lady, she clears the tables, brings the drinks etc all the above and more. And the rest of the folks are walking around from dishwasher to dining area.  5) Prepare for the bubba gutts lol. Really you will be on the toilet within five minutes after leaving and most likely loose your appetite halfway through."}
{"text":"I came to this buffet since I was participating in an activity here at the stratosphere. I was beyond disappointed. From not having croutons out for simple salad, to the lack of meat they offered. (NY strip steak) friend chicken and some assorted fish. No seafood except a small dish of sushi, No eel sauce. No crab legs. Lack of service for drinks. Desserts were stale."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Stratosphere for my birthday. The buffet is certainly not Waterfront or Borgata Buffet-like but they do have a decent selection of carved meats and veggies. I came here for Breakfast and the breakfast was OK as I had the french toast, eggs and sausage. The dessert options were disappointing."}
{"text":"Taco Bar, Baked Potato Bar, and Sandwich Bar: occupied half of the buffet.  How lazy.  I'm so glad this is was an expense paid business trip otherwise I'd be pissed."}
{"text":"Food is good but overpriced, and no discount even if you stay at the hotel. Ambiance is more of a cafeteria type setting and servers wear t-shirts. Service was good."}
{"text":"The dining room had a lot of empty tables. I agree with a lot of the below average review. Food was definitely uninspiring. I had the creamed corn soup, it was way too thick. It was more like thick gravy than soup. Their sushi, forget it. The entrees were just below average overall. Will never come back."}
{"text":"SUCKED...disgusting wannabe Chinese food and sushi.  Taco trucks taste better than their taco station, yuck!  At $20 a pop, it was absolutely not worth it.  Kids are the same price; we should have gone to their burger joint.  If I had more time, I wanted to try the buffet at The Cosmopolitan, but we had to head back to Primm.  Of all places, I figured Statosphere would have a decent spread, NOT!  Everything was salty, the potstickers were probably from Costco Ling Ling's, total blah & big disappointment!"}
{"text":"Hey, am I a buffet fan....NO!  But we went to the Sunday champagne brunch and it was very good.  If you show your ACE play card you get a discount.  We have an orange card and rec'd $5 off I believe per person.  Plus Stratosphere sent me a buy 1 get 1 buffet coupon (along with some other offers).  So we gave it a shot because it was only $16 and change for the 2 of us.  It was VERY good.  The made to order omlettes were very good.  There was a lot to choose from.  With drinks included and having a couple of mimosas, you couldn't beat it!  Now, would I pay $20 plus tax per person???  Probably not.  But if you have an offer or get the $5 off its a pretty good deal and was not busy at all for a Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food. Cold, and old. No wonder not many people were there. You get what you pay for, this food is cheap and it tasted that way. Bottomless mimosas were awesome, but otherwise yuck. Do not go here!"}
{"text":"Expensive and the selection was really sad for a hotel buffet. definite lack of seafood... the desserts are the reason why it gets 2 stars. Lots of selection even though it was mediocre. I would not come here again since i can get better food for less else where."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Have champagne breakfast buffet with mimosas, made to order omelettes, crab legs, biscuits and gravy, sausage, bacon, roast, tons of fresh fruit; As you can see lots of variety, and great price."}
{"text":"Sad Buffet, food quality was terrible (even for a buffet). When you walk in the buffet line seems like it would have a lot of food selection because of its size but when you actually get in there you don't end up with a whole lot of choices. I'm a desert person and I didn't like a thing on the desert buffet. The dinner buffet wasn't too terrible but with all your choices in Vegas I wouldn't stop here again."}
{"text":"Very underrated buffet. Went for dinner. The choices were endless. So much stuff, everything hot & fresh. Nothing I tried I didnt like. Workers were fast and friendly, place is so clean and price are reasonable for vegas buffet standards now a days. I had a free aria buffet which is like 45 bucks. Everything was terrible, food dry and not warm. Left after 15mins. Thank god It was free.Stratospheres buffet was 22 and was 100x better. Jyst shows you newer, fancier and expensive isn't always better. Will keep returning here ."}
