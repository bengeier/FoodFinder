{"text":"I should have reviewed this establishment long ago living only a block and a half away.  Crown is take out only. It is owned by Kashmiris and if you have ever eaten Kashmiri naan, then you know full well what I mean when I say a treat is in store for you when you taste the crust of their pizzas.  Being originally from Toronto, I grew up in city where true Italian pizza is available. Calgary falls pitifully short. Pizzas are made backwards here in Calgary with the cheese above the toppings. As a result, your ham, pepperoni or whatever toppings you choose, do not carmelize and taste bland bland bland. It's like it is a plague. This city also has a facination to put enough cheese on one pizza to feed all the mice on this planet. I am sorry, but simply put, that is not real pizza.  Crown delivers and when they custom make it for you with the techniques used in Toronto, Montreal, New York or Naples, they get it right on the money. Deep dish pizza they do not serve and it is not Italian, it is American.  My favorite pizza is a delicate, but not thin, crust with spicy tomato sauce, light on the cheese with a blend of provolone, asiago, and mozzarella, topped with anchovies, mushrooms, ham, and onions and ABSOLUTELY NO CHEESE ON TOP. Crown caters to my exact requests and is close to perfect. I would give five stars if they would stop making the sloppy soggy cheese pies they normally serve. Pizza that falls in your lap or where the crust sags instead of remaining firm would start a war in Italy.  Crown cuts no corners, all the ingredients are fresh which means you do not have to put up with disgusting tasteless canned mushrooms."}
{"text":"During a dog walk, I passed by this tiny little store in a small, community strip mall. From the outward appearance of Crown Pizza and Grocery, you would think it had been closed and not in operation since the 80's.  Despite this, it popped up during my \"nearby\" search for pizza.  The few but glowing reviews were enough to get my bf and I to give it a go. 45 minutes from our initial phone call and one soggy trek by the bf later, produced a surprisingly delicious, thin crusted, medium veggie pie.  The pizza came very easy on the cheese, which I always prefer, as well as a ton of fresh veggies. We added feta and banana peppers on top, and the total came out to a measly $15!!!  I don't know where else in the city you can find a deal like this. The menu isn't extensive, but the quality makes up that small short coming."}
{"text":"This is real pizza. Calgary does not have good, authentic, dirty pizza, but Crown Pizza is working slowly to change that. Anyone who says they have a favourite pizza place in town hasn't eaten pizza outside of Calgary. Because it's a big world out there and I've had some really good pizza back in eastern Canada and no place in Calgary comes close. Crown Pizza is at least trying. It's not fancy, it's not expensive, but it is delicious. They have the basics in order: soft crust, strong and tasty sauce, lots of cheese (some even sprinkled on the crust). That's all it really takes. Forget about fancy crusts and bizarre toppings, this is as good as it gets here. The shop doesn't make for good ambiance, but it's worth a phone call for delivery if you live in the area. What makes it more authentic is that it's made in the back kitchen of a convenience store by men of indeterminate ethnic origin. This is how the best pizza I've ever had is made. By people who care, not carefully measured doses of sauce and cheese and toppings like at chains. It's cheap, too. A large 16\" pizza will run you something like $12. Give it a try, if you think you might like real pizza."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The pizza comes with 5 toppings and taxes are included in the price. Pretty tough to beat the value.  The guys who served me were very friendly and promised the pizza would be great. And it was. One of the best pizzas I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh ingredients. Very, very good price... try the House Special. $16 for a 16\" home made pizza... price can't be beat. Super nice owner - please support him. Love this place... don't support the fast food chains... go to Crown Pizza!  PS. This is take-out only... there is no sit-down portion."}
{"text":"Holy crap, hands down best pizza in calgary. New owner is very nice and they are always extremely generous with toppings. Doesn't exactly look like a classy joint, but definitely delivers with the flavour. Pepperoni pizza is absolutely covered with meat, and the crust / cheese is baked to perfection. There's something about the pizza dough that makes this place unique. Donair pizza is to die for, juicy meat, fresh tomatoes and onions.   Definitely give this place a shot!! Great deals for parties and they also have pizza by the slice if you need a snack on the way home."}
{"text":"Yum!   We picked up a donair pizza from here last night and I was so impressed! The crust was thinking, crispy and so flavourful! The donair sauce on the pizza was sweet and creamy. For $12, this was such a great deal!   This place may become my go-to for those cozy nights when I want a nice comforting pizza to bring home and enjoy with a side of Netflix."}
{"text":"Only discovered this place a short time ago but wish I had sooner!   The pizzas have a generous amount of toppings which taste good.  More importantly, the pizza has a great crust and is comparatively cheap.    Definitely a gem in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Best pizza for the price, kicks the crap outta Dominos!"}
{"text":"CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP!  Used to be 5/5 but now 1/5.  New owners are cheap and don't put any cheese or sauce on.  Barely any toppings.  It's a shame because the guy who previously owned this place was great."}
{"text":"Always dependable, delicious, down right perfection!  I have been a fan for 6 years. I do miss Kahn, but the new owners are fantastic and very talented."}
