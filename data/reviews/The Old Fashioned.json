{"text":"Great place right on the Capitol Square. Very good food and good beer selection. Pretty good prices as well. Expect to pay anywhere from $8-$10 for a sandwich/burger with side. Didn't end up having the fried cheese curds like other people recommend but they did look delicious!  Only gripes for this place are that you can expect to wait a while for a table and they do not take reservations. Second, when it gets busy the service can be slightly spotty and it seemed to take a while to get our food.  It's such a great place though that's probably why it's so busy!"}
{"text":"YES! Just all around YES! I lived in Madison for a few years before moving up north and the Old Fashioned was one of my absolutely favorite places. So when Bob and I returned to Madison after years of being away, it was the one place that I absolutely had to return to. This is the place, after all, that gave me my favorite drink - the Old Fashioned. We arrived on a Saturday and the place was PACKED! Not unusual, we were prepared. We put our names down and they have a neat new system where they text you when your table is almost ready. So you are able to leave and grab a drink somewhere else (I would strongly recommend Merchant) while you are waiting. We waited for about 45 minutes and were quickly seated near the window in the main front room. Our server was fast and friendly and brought us our drinks lickety split. I (of course) had the Old Fashioned and it was just as good as I remembered - but different than I drink them now. They use Korbel Brandy and Sprite, I am used to having Bookers and water. They are sweeter than what I am used to - but still really good. We had the cheese curds, which are far and away the best cheese curds in the Midwest... maybe tied with the ones at the MN State Fair. There is less breading and more cheese than other places and they are SO good. Bob got the slow roasted pork shoulder and I got the house burger. They were both SO SO SOOOOO good! The burger was a sloppy, messy, drippy concoction of deliciousness and the sandwich was the perfect balance of spicy, sour and sweet. The food has an \"upscale down home\" quality to it. It's not super traditional fare, there are some surprises with the food but it's still familiar enough that it's really approachable. Everything about the place felt familiar and awesome! My only (TINY) complaint is that the tables near the host stand are subject to the door opening and closing, so during the winter it can get a little chilly there. If you are in Madison and really want to experience some exceptional Wisconsin food, then you NEED to come here. As Nick Offerman said, \"It's the only place where you can get a Bratwurst in the form of a burger, and to me -- there is no finer comestible than a deep-fried cheese curd.\" And who can argue with Ron Swanson?"}
{"text":"Excellent cheese curds, good menu of burgers and great drink selection.  The service can be good, but the way of ordering at the bar can be a hassle with larger parties and/or kids.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places in all of Madison!! Everyone is really friendly and the atmosphere is really cool. Although it is always crowded they are usually pretty good at getting people in ahead of the wait time. They have plenty of beers and the best burgers!! Definitely should try it!"}
{"text":"I love the Old Fashioned. It has a great atmosphere, and they serve up comfort food at its finest.  My favorite sandwich is the pulled pork. It's a huge pile of pork on big soft bread topped with relish and muenster cheese. I have never been disappointed by this delicious thing.   I recently had the Friday cod fish fry for the first time and I thought it was great! Well seasoned, crispy, and served with a heap of fries, rye bread, and coleslaw.  And of course, you can't go wrong with the Apple Jack Old Fashioned!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here.  And while I wouldn't say I've had a mind-blowingly great meal here, everything I've had has been a well-executed, slightly-upscale take on the \"supper club\" food I grew up with.    Well, one exception on that \"mind-blowing\" thing - the fried cheese curds are amazing. It's a feat to elevate something as heavy as fried cheese to a crispy, transcendent little morsel, but they do an excellent job (and offer a wide variety of tasty dipping sauces.  I prefer the smoked paprika).  Breakfast, lunch, dinner - always solid, always delicious.   Breakfast/brunch here is a hidden gem - fresh scrambled eggs, house-cured smoked salmon, granola with Door county cherries, and other takes on brunchy classics make appearances, and there's even a few actual good options for vegetarians.  I've always had fresh ingredients, excellent preparation and seasoning, generous but not overwhelming portions.  Oh, and they have one of the better Friday fish fries in town, especially the walleye.  I've heard their Saturday prime rib is delicious, too, but I've never actually been able to get a table on a Saturday night to try it.  And therein lies the restaurant's main problem.  The Old Fashioned is a victim of its own success.  Even after the expansion into the old L'Etoile space, the restaurant is seemingly always uncomfortably crowded, loud, and the waits for a table are often unreasonably long.  If you do choose to wait, you can either pack into the bar area, stand outside, or try to cram yourself into the tiny vestibule.  It's not really something they can do terribly much about (although I do wish I didn't feel like I was running a gauntlet past the bar to get to the restrooms), but it is uncomfortable enough that when they say \"it'll be about an hour wait for a table\" I usually go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Every time I go to The Old Fashioned, I leave feeling the same way. It is always extremely crowded, and the service reflects that. I love their bar menu and appetizers, which is what I think brings me back again and again. Once we get seated, my experience seems to go downhill. We always seem to wait forever for our server to acknowledge us, then once we finally order it takes even longer to finally get our food. Again, if it weren't for the bar, I don't think we would keep going back again and again."}
{"text":"I have gone to The Old Fashioned for their beer cheese soup or a sandwich, The Old Fashioned burger is my favorite, but I did not know they have fish fry. We went Friday night and the lake perch was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. And of course I had to have an old fashion while I was there. They do not take reservations and they are always busy but worth the wait. Always good food."}
{"text":"I just ate/drank at the old fashioned for the first time saturday night (4/22).  I can personally vouch for the deliciousness that is the macaroni and cheese.  oohhh man...if you are a true wisconsinite at heart, then i encourage you to try this cheesy goodness.  i just drank my favorite spotted cow, but everyone else at the table had old fashioneds, and liked them.  nice vibe...very laid back and chill.  not trendy at all.  and the server was very attentive even though it was busy.  the atmosphere is very wisconsin, but it was missing one thing - no hunter orange :)"}
{"text":"I'm totally new to the city- an interloper from the South, I guess you could say. A friend suggested having lunch at the Old Fashioned to try their cheese curds. The interior of the restaurant is cozy but modern. Luckily there was no wait for lunch around 1 PM on a Wednesday and I was in a pretty large group. I ordered the grilled cheese with a side of cheese curds. I thought, \"I'm in Wisconsin. If I'm going to order something cheesy I might as well go all of the way!\" The grilled cheese sandwich was fantastic- filled up with cheese which was accented by some grilled red peppers. The cheese curds were phenomenal. It was my first foray into cheese curds so I guess it's only downhill from here. Oh well, at least I got to try the best in Madison. The menu prices are very reasonable for the quality of food served here."}
{"text":"So unimpressed. Not from Madison but referred here by a local, as the drinks were great and food till 2pm. Walked in to a surly barmaid at 11pm and told \"kitchen closed and the bar almost is\". She had no knowledge of the bourbon they carried and plopped down a list. After serving our drinks never did a last call. SO unfriendly. I can get bourbon anywhere - never again."}
{"text":"Burgers very good... beer cheddar cheese soup was awesome... popcorn found in the bad snacks menu was eh...  The spicy burger the gf and I split was nice and spicy. Burger itself was nice and juicy. I just had the mixed greens salad which had a lot of greens for the price. Loved the dressing. Cheese curds were really good as well.  Lots of beers and good food with decent service. Solid 4 star place. Only thing I didn't like was the cheddar popcorn. I didn't know it was just popcorn in a bag and wasn't homemade. Such a shame in that."}
{"text":"Cheese curds are a must! Walked all over looking for a place for both teenagers and grandma, and this was it! Absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"You come here if you can find a seat.   Or you wait.   You get the burger, and for an appetizer, you get the cheese curds with Tiger sauce.   Don't ask questions.   Put your phone down.   Do it now! GOOOOOOOOOO! GET TO THE CHEESE CURDS!"}
{"text":"Great food! Good environment and great service! The onion straws were really good too."}
{"text":"Very busy and still great service. I couldn't give it 5 stars because the constant door opening and closing created a very cold effect. The server was awesome and the food was great!"}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a popular college bar in Madison, Wisconsin. Well-known for their food (especially their cheese curds) it is a popular place amongst the students.   The Wisconsin Burger consists of local grass-fed beef grilled over a live fire, cheddar cheese, olive oil mayonnaise, raw onion, and is served on a buttered and toasted bun. I added bacon to my burger for a little something extra. The Wisconsin cheddar, bacon, and two slices of beef made an amazing combination. Add in the mayonnaise and a little ketchup and I had a creamy, cheesy, salty, and beefy burger on my hands. The burger was quite manageable and everything was well portioned. The stand out ingredients were definitely the cheese and bacon (which I am assuming are some of the Midwest's finest).   Old Fashioned has the best burger I've eaten in Madison to date. High quality ingredients, a well-known blend of flavors, and the option to add-on some very tasty bacon. Compared to the best burger I have eaten the bun and beef fell a little short, but at the price point it's sold at I wouldn't expect it to compare. If you're looking for the best burger in Madison The Old Fashioned is a good bet."}
{"text":"SERVICE: Service here is very good. Never have had an issue.  FOOD: We've been several times for both brunch and dinner and it's always been great. Recommend the beer cheese soup and the old fashioned burger. However, the walleye sandwich is also excellent and don't forget to try the cheese curds. Some of the best in Madison. DRINKS: Recommend the classic Wisconsin brandy old fashioned though they have a well stocked variety. Keep a look out for the rotating beer of the month.  ATMOSPHERE: A Wisconsin institution. One of the best Madison has to offer. Love the retro decorations on the walls. Ask about upstairs seating. It's not as well known but it offers a whole different experience. Constantly crowded so it can be a little overwhelming plus they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious. Went here with a few couples, and the atmosphere was great for everyone. Will definitely be going back here next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great draught selection, KILLER curds, classic vibe and awesome historic tavern culture present in bar snacks, beer signs and uniforms. Definitely try the walleye sandwich!"}
{"text":"They have the best cheese curds in town. The service is friendly and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"This is a spot that Nick Offerman loves.  So, there's that.   I think this place is a fun spot to take someone who isn't originally from Madison or if you want some good fried cheese curds.  However, the eating environment leaves something to be desired. That, and the wine list. With as focused they are on the quality of their beer list, I was extremely disappointed in their grocery store selections for wine.   Service was slow at first, but ended nicely and I was pleased overall.   I think this is a spot that I will only frequent once per year as it gives me the same anxiety that I get when I go to the mall."}
{"text":"A classic joint with a great beer selection and the best of Wisconsin bar/supper club food. Try their walleye sandwich!"}
{"text":"Quaint bar on the square that was decorated for the holiday season to add some cheer. Quieter bar during the holiday week resulting in it closing early. But, good apps and drinks (with over 50 WI beers on tap) and great for just a chill hangout with friends/family."}
{"text":"Beer batter cheese curds. with tiger sauce. i don't know what tiger sauce is, but its delicious. The cheese curds are to die for. my husband, who is lactose intolerant, eats a dish each time we go by himself and believes it to be well worth the bonding time he later has with the bathroom (caused by his lactose intolerance and should not be taken as a fault of the cheese curds).   That being said, the rest of the food is A-OK, as is the space. Nothing special. Just salads with a bit too much dressing, sandwiches and fried fish-- all of which i've had better at other places.  :"}
{"text":"Pretty much everything on the menu is good, but just do yourself a huge favor and order an Old Fashioned burger with a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned or one of their many beers.  Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"It gets one star because the waitress was sweet.  We start with cheese curds! We went there because everyone said they're sooo good!! WRONG!!! I am a lover of deep fried cheese curds and have indulged in them at many establishments. Never before have I experienced anything like this!! They came delivered to the table in a pool of grease! It was ridiculous so I asked the waitress she could send them back to have them cooked a little better she said they would give us a fresh batch. So she comes back shortly after with a new batch; however, they were just as greasy! I used my napkin to blot the grease off of 3 and my napkin was full. (ps- I had a total of 10 and was sick the rest of the afternoon)  The wurst platter came served lukewarm?! I thought that kind of meat supposed to be served warm or hot!!!!  We also ordered two drinks the Mamosa was made with what appeared to be high pulp orange juice!!! It was gloppy and awful!! The Cosmopolitan was the worst Cosmo I've ever had in my life. It tasted nothing like what it was supposed to.   At the end the manager was kind enough to comp the curds from the bill.  The place wasn't busy, we sat down at 11am, plenty of open tables and an empty bar.  I'm not sure how the four things we ordered all came out so awful, but it was truly a bad experience!!"}
{"text":"Good Madison staple but a little overrated at this point. The beer selection is great and atmosphere is top notch, but the food is just your everyday pub food. Not bad but not phenomenal either. Burgers were good, but the cheese curds...every single time I order them they are sitting in a pile of oil or grease and are very soggy. Great place to drink and hang out, but I would rather eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"We showed up to this restaurant described as a \"staple\" in Madison because it showed up on the \"dog-friendly\" list. Sadly, it was not dog friendly. I guess at some times they have patio seating, but despite it being a lovely day, the patio was closed. That's all good and well, but the host was fairly cold bordering on rude when we asked if there was any way they could seat our party on the patio. Come on dude, throw us a bone! Just a warm, \"I'm so sorry, we just don't have enough servers to cover\" or whatever the case might be. A cold \"No\", and a blank stare don't really leave you feeling great. Oh well, the Irish pub around the square was great  and had plenty of space for us and the dog on their patio."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned has good food and great beer. Their cheese curds are delicious, but the Tiger Sauce overrated. Difficult to find something healthy, although their side salad option is an excellent one."}
{"text":"Had dinner on trip to Madison/UW. Meal lived up to all the starts and reviews on yelp. Glad we stoped by."}
{"text":"What the F is in the ranch sauce with fried cheese curds???  That is some nasty, yummy stuff!!!!   At lunch I had the bloody mary and it was also the sh**!  I am not from the area, so, to see a bloody done right like this is a treat, and almost a meal!  I had the prime rib sandwich, and although tasty, I thought it could have been trimmed a bit better so it wasn't so chewy. I wish I could come back more often to experience the rest of the menu and the large tap selection."}
{"text":"No as fashioned as the name. The food is so salty. But the environment is good. So many people went there."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and was not impressed. The burgers were over seasoned and not that great. The cheese curds were the worst that I've ever eaten, all mashed together (try Craft table & tap in Middleton for good cheese curds). The warm potato chips were good once you added a little salt to them. The beer list was exceptional, which was needed after the meal I had."}
{"text":"Grabbed a beer post-farmers market. Great spot with Wisconsin roots and solid service."}
{"text":"One of the places you have to try in Madison. The old fashioneds are fantastic and the cheese curds are the best."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the Old Fashioned is one of the most overrated places in town. Always busy, forget going out with a group on a weekend night unless you want to wait an hour and a half.  Yes, the curds are good, but I've had better (try the Rigby). The best thing is the sauces that come with the curds (you have your choice of 4, all of which are pretty good). You can also get the sauces with the shoestring onions, which I probably prefer to the curds. The lazy susans are fun and different, and in my opinion the most exciting thing that this place has to offer.   I may be biased because I am not a meat eater, and therefore the Old Fashioned menu does not have much to offer, but I've talked to many other friends who agree that its reputation is overblown for what it is. If you want to have a casual lunch at a Wisco style pub for lunch during the week, the OF has decent salads and sandwiches. But with so many far better restaurants, gastropubs and bars in Madison, I can't imagine why you'd choose waiting in a cramped space at the OF just for the sake of the curds. Does not compute."}
{"text":"this place is ridiculous! call in to see how long the wait was, they said 10 minutes over the phone before we headed out there. by the time we got there, we went in unnoticed by the wait staff and later was told there was a 25-30 minute wait! like wtf!? i nearly blew up in there considering i have to drive from the other side of the city, while gas is 3.49 a gal!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night and was surprised to see so many people here. There was a short wait for a table, so I ended up ordering a beer. I think it was called \"exposed\"...I do remember that it's brewed by the Horny Goat Brewing Co. After being seated, I had a tough time deciding what to order. The menu was rather big. In the end, it came down to the fish (tilapia) tacos, or the bratwurst sandwich. I couldn't make up my mind so I ordered both the bratwurst sandwich and a fish taco, for good measure. Overall, I was satisfied with the food, beer, and service. The food wasn't spectacular by any means, but seems like a cool place to hang out and have a few brews with good food. Also, the food seemed reasonably priced, but then again, I'm a Californian."}
{"text":"Overpriced, loud and drafty but great cheese curds...and old fashioneds."}
{"text":"My memory of being here is a little hazy, but I know I had a great time. My husband and I were in town from Chicago with my aunt and uncle, and stopped here after dinner. While munching on unbelievable cheese curds, we consumed many, many beers. My husband and uncle are both brewers, so we drink a lot of craft beer in our family, and they were really geeking out over the menu. The place was packed, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The #30 is a good Hamburg. I ordered the salad instead of fry to reduce the carbohydrates, but what consisted of s salad was just greens on the side of the plate. No fixings or shredded cheese."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and flying solo. The place was full but I got a seat at the bar right away. Bartender was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, and even willingly explained his busted up nose and forehead (I know that's random, but it's true).   This was also my introduction to Wisconsin beer. The Old Fashioned has 50+ WI beers on tap, and many more in bottles. The bartender poured me samples without me even asking, and nearly all of it was very good. I went light foodwise - beet salad with salmon - but it was quite good.   Also the location is great - right on the square of Madison's beautiful (and lately famous) statehouse. Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"A five-star establishment represents the highest possible level of service across the entire spectrum of the dining experience.  Personally, I value a friendly personality and humble attitude in a server above all else.   No positive vibes in this place, I wish I could say I had a better experience here on a Friday night... Sadly, the employee we interacted with seemed annoyed that we wanted two of Old Fashioned's Old Fashioneds.   I will probably still be back, because it was a phenomenal cocktail- but I deducted two stars for lack of human propriety.  Cheers!  Victoria"}
{"text":"Ah, The Old Fashioned. This is Madison... and Wisconsin, too. I think of the food as Wisconsin staples, one step up. The ingredients are local and fresh, and I always leave happy. I'm a fan of the walleye sandwich and Green Bay chili in particular.  The bar and beer selection is absolutely fantastic... well, save for that one \"import\" brew from Minnesota :D I kid. Grab a beer, an Old Fashioned, anything you'd like, and just enjoy."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner when in town for a conference. I came with a coworker per an Uber driver's suggestion.  We had cheese curds, supposed to be some of the best in Madison (although I don't think I've ever had a \"bad\" cheese curd). They were great. Coworker had prime rib sandwich and I had a turkey sandwich. Large portions and food was delicious. Great selection of local draft beers, we each had a flight.  Server was awesome, we didn't feel rushed to leave at all, despite the place getting pretty busy, we chilled and had another beer after our food. Price was great too!"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on the Cooking Channel where they were doing a half hour show on the best Mac and Cheese.  The Old Fashioned was the first stop.  I happened to be in Madison, WI for work and had to try it.  I sat at the bar and Billy helped me out.  He made a great suggestion for the Mac and Chesse and it was fabulous.  I highly recommend the Mac and Chesse here."}
{"text":"The first place I ate when visiting Madison was the Old Fashioned, right down the street from our hotel and at the corner of the capital building. I liked it enough to go a second time for drinks and snacks in the evening. This review encompasses both trips.  Obviously, as a burger connoisseur, I had to try the Old Fashioned's rendition. For lunch we ordered at the bar, a typical burger and beer combo. The beers available are all local to the area, which was nice. You can get the burger with onion rings, fries or cheese curds -- I chose the curds. The burger itself was overcooked (I ordered medium, but what came out was almost well done). Still, for being overcooked, it was still a tasty burger. Combined with the beer and curds, it was a fine lunch in a nice location.   Later I went back for a cheese plate and drinks. The cheeses were also all local, and there were several combinations to be ordered. Honestly, the selections offered seemed like nice pairings, and it was very nice to try some local dairy considering I am not from Wisconsin.   The drink was, of course, the Old Fashioned. Warning, here an old fashioned is made with brandy, and also had crushed cherries in the bottom. The result was a drink overly fruity and sweet, though the staff gets points for warning me about the brandy.   Overall, Its a good establishment that offers local food and drink, but the burger was overcooked and the cocktail mediocre."}
{"text":"Served cold soup followed by cold chilli.  Had the chilli replaced by another cold bowl of chilli.  Wait person never asked about the second bowl. My experience with this place is hit and miss."}
{"text":"my husband and i both really enjoyed lunch here. ben was our server and he was very attentive and speedy! i had the salmon salad and it was amazing! salmon so fresh and tasty. my husband had the chilli. it was some of the best chilli we have ever had! and let me mention they have a build your own oldfashion, needless to say we each had one. we sat outside and got to look at the capital building. great place, you should go!"}
{"text":"Cheese curds!  Beer! (And some very cheap beer that changes every month!)  What more could you ask for?  Great burgers?  Okay, they have that too.  Really affordable food if you stick to the burgers and various sandwiches on the menu or visit on days they have specials like fish fry night and two-for-one burgers.    HOWEVER, the tacos they serve on Tuesdays are NOT tacos.  They just put whatever protein you choose on a tortilla and take it to your table.  I lived in Austin, TX for two years and the tacos at The Old Fashioned just made me sad.  Sorry, WI, but you don't know tacos!  Stick to what you know :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Food always comes quickly. Everything is delicious. Prices are very reasonable. Environment is jovial and nice. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Brandy Old Fashions is a must. This place is a traditional Madison staple. Come early and often because it fills up quickly.   MUST GET THE PRIME RIB SANDWICH!!! Melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Definitely worth eating at while you're in Madison! I had their fried lake perch for lunch and it was deeeeeeeeelicious! The fries and coleslaw were extremely tasty too - you're going to leave full. Mr. H and I ordered a Rye Whiskey Old Fashioned and split it, it was very good and worth the price."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy burger, fried cheese curds and a beer for lunch at the bar. Everything tasted great, I enjoyed the large beer selection. Seems like pretty good pub menu for location."}
{"text":"Oh The Old Fash... how I love thee, even on those nights that you have to wait a bit for a table, WORTH IT.   This restaurant is as the name would suggest a throwback to all that is Wisconsin and our love for food and beer! (And cheese curds, haha.) While they don't brew on site as some pubs, this gem of the Capitol Square has one of the larger selections of microbrews that is sure to hit the spot. Oh and make sure you have them make one of their namesake drinks... The old fashioned.  The food is very Wisco and a great blend of variety that you want from a downtown restaurant but with the flair and flavor of what small town Wisconsinites have enjoyed for years.   The atmosphere is a bit eclectic and busy but it fits the mood of the restaurant, a place to come hang with your friends and family while taking in Wisconsin. The one downfall is that this place is almost too popular for its own good, especially during tourist season. They DO NOT take reservations, btw.  Wait times can get pretty high but one nice perk is that their seating cue pagers allow you to go hang out on the square and not in the doorway. (just don't go too far, as the pagers won't work if you get busy shopping.)  I love this restaurant and am glad that we have it here in the Capital City of WI to be a beacon for visitors that don't have time to explore the small cities and little intricacies that make Wisconsin WISCONSIN!"}
{"text":"If you go anytime between 5 and 8 you will wait an hour minimum for a table. You can get drinks while you wait and they are very reasonably priced. The cheese curds are the best I've ever had. The food never disappoints."}
{"text":"Went over Labor Day weekend. Very busy! Had to wait but they text you when your table is ready. Had a beet salad. Boyfriend had huge fish sandwich. Both were good but surprised to see this place written up in so many places as a place to go. It didn't seem unique."}
{"text":"Really good food and atmosphere. The house special burger was excellent-- the fried egg and bacon just add an excellent finish to the juicy burger. Cheese curds are well done, slightly crispy on the outside with moist cheddar within. Onion strings were pretty good-- got an enormous portion of them too. Prices reasonable, and an enormous cookie for a buck?! Gotta love that."}
{"text":"These are the best cheese curds I've ever had. I literally will dream about them. Their burgers are also top notch. I ate every bite. The only thing they don't have that I wanted was a milkshake. They should really consider adding them to the lineup."}
{"text":"The alcohol selection is HUGE and awesome. Something for everyone! (And we appreciated that it was mostly local/WI breweries).  The beer battered cheese curds are amazing *drools*  I had a prime rib sandwich and my man had the pulled pork, which we enjoyed. I wouldn't say it's a great restaurant like if you're looking for somewhere to sit down at a table and revel in the food, but hey, it's tasty, mmhm! Great fries, monumental portions of onion strings, and the staff was knowledgeable and attentive.  Not the cheapest place but for the experience, I was damn pleased."}
{"text":"I think this place is a little overrated. I mean I know I live in Wisconsin, but I think you could do better fired food and beer. The proportions are too big. Expect the cheap version of much of your meal. If you want comfort food that remind you of comfort food you could make at home, this is your place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. Grilled cheese and tomato soup lunch special is super filling, and worth the $8. Nice atmosphere, casual attire. Burgers are really good as well as the cheese curds! Waiters/waitresses are hit or miss, have had good and not so good."}
{"text":"Weary from studying all day, searching for the truest of true Wisconsin experiences, my friends and I (self-aware pretentious visitors from Chicago) were lured to The Old Fashioned by tales of fried cheese curds, cheese, cream, burgers, more fried things, and bountiful Wisconsin natives.  We waited for a bit over an hour for a table for 3 at 7PM on a Saturday night.   It was worth it.   I'll never forget about my first bite into the burger I had.  I could do nothing but exclaim, \"This is the best burger I've ever had!\" and promptly fall into a rapturous food coma.  The bun is blissfully soft, but sturdy enough to keep the burger together, rather than deteriorate as some other hefty burgers are wont to.    The fried cheese curds are also delightfully squeaky - as we were promised - and were served with some kind of interesting sauce.  My friend sampled the eponymous drink and was pleased.  But, let's be honest, the burger stole the show."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places in Madison.  The food is really greasy and it gets really busy in there.  For the most part, I like how the general age groups seems to be post-college.  I heard someone say that when I first moved here and that was my original reason for checking it out.  Wednesday night karaoke is fun.  A female manager was really rude to me one night and I have not been back since."}
{"text":"It is what it is - an edible monument to the best food and drink of Wisconsin.  The food is carefully chosen from the best local meat, cheese producers, often organic as well.  It is (how to say it...) indulgent, certainly.  They offer updated, creative versions of classics, and have resurrected some long-lost foods.    DO NOT MISS: The cheese curds are, quite simply, a masterpiece.  As a life-long connoisseur of these delectable bites, I am now ruined for any other.  After eating the OF's, I can't bring myself to eat cheese curds anywhere else.  And the delicious, hearty, flavorful sauces (tiger blue, paprika, garlic) make them all the more wonderful.  And the homemade chips, fries, and onion haystacks are marvelous too.   Food:  Fish fry, brunch, egg-and-bacon-topped-burger, OH MY!  It's hard for me to understand the problems people had with the food.  It's not delicate food but it is delicious.  They offer several different kinds of fish for the fish fry at three different price levels - walleye, perch, and maybe bluegill?  (I haven't had the walleye, but the other two are awesome - and the tartar sauce is cool and tangy.)  I've had brunch there a few times - the bloody mary is a must-drink, garnished creatively and with a classic Sconnie beer chaser.  I've had eggs benedict, omlettes, and some type of amazing french toast and been pleased with all of them.  The burgers, grilled chicken sandwich, and mac and cheese are also too yummy for words.  I'm not a fan of their brandy vinagrette dressing, but the specialty salads are yummy - one with cherries and another with beets - for those that would prefer to avoid a heart attack.    Service: The bartenders know how to make a good drink, and their service is wonderful.  I've had pretty good luck with the servers and never waited too long to be seated.  I think they were understaffed several months ago but they have been accomodating of me when I have needed to get in and out.  Like any popular and new restaurant, they have their growing pains.  On the whole, it beats many of Madison's restaurants in service, since irritated and uninformed servers seem the norm in this town.  (Or maybe it's just my east coast sensibility that expects a bit more.)   Atmosphere: The lighting is beautiful, the mood friendly, the seating comfortable, and the music is unobtrusive but interesting - honkey tonk and bluegrass during the day and everything under the sun at night.  The best part is the huge circular booths across from the bar, which is the perfect place to gather with friends.  The bartenders are friendly, so if you're just in a two- or three-some, consider sitting at the bar.  They also occassionally have live music at night, which can be great fun.  All in all, it's a hit.  If you're looking for an expensive, fancy, refined meal or a fast food experience, you won't find it at The Old Fashioned.  But if you want a fun restaurant experience, a great meal made with excellent, fresh ingredients, and good value for your money, you've got it."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of The Old Fashioned, but I don't get there as much as I'd like because it's ALWAYS packed. Service is always friendly and attentive, huge selection of beer, great food (amazing cheesecurds), and of course a craftily delicious brandy old-fashioned). Overall, always a great experience.  RATINGS (A+  --  F) Service: A Food: A Drinks: A+ Price $: B+ Atmosphere: A Overall Experience: A"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8-10 coworkers after work. Food was good but the service was odd, at best. One of said coworkers was being loud and joking around, and apparently said something that upset a hostess. We found this out when our server, after we paid our bill mind you, told us that we should apologize to the hostesses because they were upset about what was said, and then he quickly walked away. Two people from our party went to the stand to apologize, not knowing exactly what was said that was offensive, and both hostesses were then rude to them when they tried to apologize and still wouldn't say what was offensive. Like I said, odd."}
{"text":"Maybe we just got the wrong things... But the chili I would NOT recommend. And the veggie sandwich was only ok.   Great beer though with an amazing selection. Would definitely come back for the beer."}
{"text":"Located on Capitol Square, this place has a very extensive menu. Anything you want, they got it. The drink menu might be as long as the Bible. This is a great place to go with a big group, try a flight of beers and toss back some cheese curds. They do not take reservations however, so make sure you put your name in about thirty minutes before you plan on eating and grab a drink at the bar while you wait."}
{"text":"Awesome service & best cheese curds! Had the walleye sandwich, dipped the bread in my wisconsin cheddar soup"}
{"text":"Love the ambience and how cozy it is. Also, they have some of the best burgers in town alongside Dotty's and DEFINITELY the best cheese curds. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  They also have a great selection of booze and the waitstaff is friendly. It's a really well-rounded establishment in general."}
{"text":"Terrible service and snotty people! The food is average but for some reason Madison people go crazy for it. Their cheese curds are supposed to be the best but maybe people are only saying that because the rest of the menu is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"If you live in Madison and you are trying to think about where to bring visitors, this IS the place.   Pros: -Best fried cheese curds on the planet -Their paprika dip could be it's own food group -Their prices are really phenomenal $5 for a burger and crispy perfectly cooked fries? A steal -Their drinks are tasty! -Great beer list -Sits right on the Capitol Square   Cons: -It can get downright loud in there where you can't hear what the person next to you is saying (but the pro to this is great people watching) -Sometimes can have a long wait (but again, such is the curse of great restaurants)  Eat here. Period."}
{"text":"Obsessed with the cheese curds gahhhhhhh! highly recommend."}
{"text":"the sunday brunch is well worth trying. they open at 9a, so if you get there early, you'll avoid the crowd during this popular weekend pastime; or at least you'll be ahead of the game.  the walleye is crisply fried, not with the beer-batter you think of when imagining every other fish fry; but a darker, thinner batter that allows you to still taste the fish. the sunny-side up eggs are never under or over done. they also feature two daily scrambles, one vegetarian, and one meaty. i've yet to try the scramble as the walleye has me every visit.  their bloody mary's are made with very veggie tomato juice, as opposed to a bland tomato mix; which makes them taste like they used fresh-squeezed tomato juice.  they also have a coffee bean roasted by ancora especially for them, and it's never weak. it's worth the $2 for a never ending cup.  expect to spend $25 for brunch and coffees for two; add more for a bloody or mimosa."}
{"text":"This place is one the best in Madtown. It has super hardy food and great meat selections. Incredible beer on tap and great service. This place is perfect in the winter for a comfort meal. I would recommend the ribeye sandwich which is amazing. Also the shoe string fries are so good."}
{"text":"Great local pub with wonderful food!"}
{"text":"The long waits for a table at almost any time of day is a bit annoying, and while the carnivorous food is excellent, possibly the best pub food in town, The Old Fashioned is perhaps slightly overrated. That said, this place should hit the top of the list for anyone stopping in Madison for a short while. The bar is ridiculous in the number of taps, and the salads are good enough that they should keep any vegetarian (and many carnivores) happy."}
{"text":"Such a great place. I'm new to the area, but grew up in Wisconsin, and this is traditional Wisconsin fare done right. The selections of brews (and other beverages) is extensive, and the bar is packed after work and on the weekends - beware. The menu is great. The beer-cheese soup is a fave, the cheese curds are freshly made, not pre-packaged and defrosted.  The portions for the sandwiches are entrees are huge, and they are delicious. The prices are very reasonable. A sandwich entree goes for as little as $8. Their desserts are also great. Inquire into the specials. Just beware, parking is difficult, as it's on the Square, and crowds after work and on the weekends are crazy. Hours of wait time are not unusual. Still, the Old Fashioned is iconic Wisconsin."}
{"text":"This is a sample of what was sent to the email address provided on The Old Fashioned website. Was sent 6/15 and have not heard back from anyone in management. Decided to post to Yelp in hopes of providing a service to other potential customers that do not want to be disappointed with service. Food is always good, but service is horrible 90% of the time. My suggestion is to sit at the bar and not a table. It's a better experience and you aren't ignored by the staff when at the bar. After this experience all I think this establishment cares about is your money. I will now be frequenting restaurants that provide an enjoyable experience and not a train wreck.   Please enjoy a snippet of my frustrations towards The Old Fashioned. There is a character limit on Yelp reviews and that's why it might not flow perfect. I couldn't include everything ;-)  To start off, we had to wait 7-8 minutes for our server (Jesse) to even acknowledge that we were a table of his. Did the host not tell the server he sat his table? Was the server overwhelmed? Or was he just plain ignoring the fact that he had a table? These were all questions that we were asking ourselves as we sat there and watched as almost every staff member in the building walked by and noticed that we were sitting there with our menus closed waiting for someone to acknowledge that we were even in the restaurant.  Finally, when he did come to the table, he made it seem as he was completely oblivious that he even had a new table.  That is where I became upset, as I work closely with management around the state of Wisconsin and see first hand how table service is KEY!  All he had to do was come by and acknowledge that we were his table and say that he was a bit busy and that he will be with us shortly...that would have calmed the storm from the beginning.  But, we were never acknowledge by anyone that walked by.  If it was that busy, we should not have been sat by the host and we would have gladly waited at the bar for a table to be ready.  In this case though, we needed a server to be ready and not a table, as there were multiple tables open in the dining room.  Now, after ordering our round of drinks and appetizers we were hoping that the server could redeem himself slightly, but again, FAIL!  THE FOOD BEAT OUT THE DRINKS!! How does this happen?? Not only did we wait 7 minutes to order our drinks, we waited another 20 minutes to receive our drinks!! How do you expect a customer to be happy when it takes almost a half hour after sitting down to have a drink in their hand? We had to ask the two girls that were running food to find our drinks for us.  (They were great by the way.) Obviously our drinks were watered down and most of the ice had melted by the time we got them, but nobody offered a solution to our issue of waiting 20 minutes for drinks. Never saw a manager, never had an apology from the server, not even an explanation of why it took so long.  Again, either the server was completely unaware of his mistake or just ignored the fact it took as long as it did.  Either way, not good for customer service.  After receiving the food and drinks from our nonexistent server we were satisfied with our choices and were hoping again, that the service could be turned around. We waited for the server to come back and check on us and ask about the food and drink and to order another round of drinks. We had to flag him down to order our next round, because either he was unaware of basic serving techniques and customer service, or just didn't care that we were a table of his.  When we flagged him down to order the next round, we then put in our order forour dinners.  He seemed surprised that we wanted to order food and wasn't even ready to write anything down.  Why would you be surprised that someone is eating at a restaurant? Luckily, this time the food didn't beat out the drinks, but we still had to wait 15 minutes to get our second round.  We had to go up to the bar and ask a bartender to make them for us because we still hadn't received them.  They were made right away, but again, no apology, no explanation, and no acknowledgement by our server. The bartender that helped us, also looked to possibly be a manager, as she was not wearing The Old Fashioned T-Shirt.  Why wouldn't the manager at least ask us if everything was ok, because if we have to ask for drinks that we ordered through the server at the bar, there are obvious issues.  I never expect for an establishment to give anything away for free, but in this case, we had to pay full price for our two rounds of drinks and they took 20 mins and 15 mins and we had to bother another staff member to even get them that quick.  If you can call 35 minutes for two rounds quick."}
{"text":"Our experience was really good! We came right after an 11am Badger game. It was about 3:45/4 when we got here and they quoted 30-45 for 2 people, which was closer to 20 minutes. We ordered 2 drinks at the bar. My dirty martini was perfect, except I had to ask for an extra olive (nbd). When seated, my husband and I ordered the cheese curds with paprika sauce- yum!! Then for dinner we ordered the Old Fashioned Burger with a side salad. Amazing!! My second drink was also really good-- the Brandy Slush. Couldn't even taste the brandy, but definitely felt it ;) overall, great experience but we have to give a lot of credit to our server Ali who was amazing!"}
{"text":"Large selection of beer and good food. Problem is that this place is very popular and you always have to wait for a while before you can get seated."}
{"text":"There's a summer sausage sandwich here that, while it's probably terrible for you, is one of the food items that I strongly associate with Madison."}
{"text":"Not sure why it's taken me this long to review this place. It's definitely in my top 5 restaurants in Madison. They absolutely nail the more traditional Wisconsin style dishes, as you'll see in a minute.  I eat here pretty frequently, easily once or twice a month, and I don't eat out that often!   I'll start by stating what I DON'T like about the place first, since this will be short: - It's really really loud. - Occasionally spotty service (very occasionally)  That's it. My only complaints. Not even complaints, really. Both are understandable side effects of an extremely popular restaurant. The loudness really isn't avoidable. The service spottiness I think is more a function of how crazy the place can get when it's busy. You may have to remind your server you need water.  I will also mention that a few months ago they opened an \"annex\" of sorts. They took over the space L'Etoile Restaurant used to occupy, combining the two spaces into the same restaurant. This added a bunch more seating which helps alleviate some of the crowding, but it doesn't eliminate it.  I've eaten here for breakfast lunch and dinner, and I can easily say that I've never had a bad meal here.  I'll also add that the fried cheese curds they have here are the best I've ever tasted. I think the breading contains narcotics. :)  Otherwise, some general notes:  Breakfast: - Wonderful bloody marys. I tend to order them extra spicy, and they never disappoint. - There's always a daily scrambler on offer, and those have always been great. - A huge piece of breaded Walleye for breakfast? YES PLEASE! - The potatoes that come with most of the breakfast plates aren't really my cup of tea, I'm a hashbrown kinda guy. But they are absolutely edible and typically well seasoned. - Breakfast served until 2PM.  Lunch: - Get there toward the early or late end of the lunch rush. In my experience, if you show up at noon, you WILL exceed an hour.(For those with somewhat strict lunch periods at their job)  Dinner: - Easily one of the best fish frys in town. - It's super busy on the weekends, expect to wait. Just drink delicious Wisconsin craft beers while you wait. - They absolutely NAIL the Sheboygan style bratwurst. My family is from there, so I know what the real ones are like. They do em right.   I'll finish by saying this place has one of the better selections of Wisconsin-brewed beers that I've ever seen. Beer heaven!"}
{"text":"What else can you say about this Madison landmark? Our first visit here exceeded our expectations. Try the spicy burger with a Packerland Pils. Classic combo! Highly recommended when in Madison."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Ordering is interesting in that you write on card and pay at register. They missed our appetizers and as a result they paid for them!!  Cheese curds are a must, even if you are healthy eater... The are so good they haunt you later. Great selection of Wisconsin beers."}
{"text":"I hate to give The Old Fashioned such a negative review because I'm a lover of all things Wisconsin and I love their beer menu.   HOWEVER I came here for brunch with my friend and her fiance and were SEVERELY disappointed with the (lack of) service we received from our waiter and my food (ham and eggs) was served cold. In hindsight I probably should have sent it back to the kitchen but I was probably too fed up to try to flag down the waiter yet again, as I had somewhere to be that afternoon.   First, my friend's fiance order a cappucino. Nope, the machine was \"not turned on yet.\" (odd). So he ordered an iced tea instead, asked for it sweetened.  My friend ordered a lemonade. Nope, no lemonade.  I ordered a coffee, said I took cream and sugar. (I was half expecting him to say \"I'm sorry, we don't have coffee.\")  Our waiter continued to screw everything up, take forever, and couldn't even split our bill accurately. Worst dining experience of my life - that waiter should be fired.  *note that this post was from 2009 or 2010 and I made an edit - I didn't actually eat here in 2011. Hopefully the brunch waitstaff has improved!!"}
{"text":"Great place and great service at the bar - was helped by Kurt - who had an encyclopedic knowledge of all things food,drink, and local to boot - just a great experience"}
{"text":"Everyone seems to love this place but it's pretty average in my opinion. Brunch was even less than average. I'm not a huge drinker so maybe that is what I'm missing. There is always wait. The service is good. The food is just ok though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast on a Sunday morning... very impressed with this place! The restaurant was packed but we were able to grab a spot at the bar with full service. Ordered the Belgian waffle with a side of bacon and a coffee. My friend ordered the country fried steak and I tried a bite. So flavorful and delicious, albeit a little heavier than I like to go for breakfast. The service was fast and very friendly, and price is reasonable. Oh and I grabbed cheese curds to go... very tasty!  I will definitely keep this on my list to go to. I saw their beer list and want to go back when I can stay longer for drinks."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch as we were passing through town. It was super busy, but we were able to find a table in the bar immediately. Our waitress was really good, seemed to love her job. My husband had the Old fashioned burger, and I had the BLT, which was unbelievable! The heirloom tomatoes were huge-the kind you can only get in the Midwest, thick handmade bread, crisp bacon. Honestly, the best sandwich I've ever eaten. We were seriously bummed that we weren't staying closer so we could come back. We'll be there the next time we're in the Madison area."}
{"text":"I used to think that there was no where out there that could possibly match or surpass how awesome Michigan beer is. I like to think that it has everything to do with fresh water and the Great Lakes. The Old Fashioned makes me reevaluate my choice. Great selection of taps, killer happy hour (bogo), and piles of cheese and sausage inspired foods followed by nectar like rye whiskey drinks. Take me drunk I'm home! I need one of these places in my neighborhood. I tip my hat to you Madison. Yet another amazing watering hole filled with new and previously undiscovered delights. Count me in for happy hour next time Glassroots Tradeshow is in town."}
{"text":"This place operates strangely.  When I was there for lunch on a weekday, we had to wait in line for a table and then immediately get up and wait in line again to place our order at the bar.  The food was brought out to us, and though the grilled cheese was fine, the brandy vinaigrette on my salad was DELICIOUS.  I will be back even though I cursed the weird line system."}
{"text":"We visited in a Saturday night.  A table for three an were told it would be a 20 minute wait.  Not bad, but we didn't even wait that long.  Our server was very attentive and nice.  Out a appetizer arrives very quickly.  We ordered the beer battered cheese curds.  They were good, but a bit greasy & could have cooked a bit longer.  Our entree's were cherry salad, brat sandwich & turkey sandwich.  All were wonderful!  This was our first time here & definitely would return!!  Great food, quick service!"}
{"text":"I gave their fish fry another try this week to make sure that I was not being unreasonable. And this time, I did it on a weekday evening so the kitchen was not as busy as on the weekend (still plenty busy though). My disappointment with the fish fry continued - batter was not crispy enough and overall, the flavors were just not there.   A Wisconsin classic cannot be called a classic if they continue to mess up their fish fries. That will be like Packers quarterbacks not able to throw successful hail mary's. Just not acceptable."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. The bar cabinets were beautiful. The retro beer paraphernalia made me know I was back home (grew up in Madison ('62-71).  The Wisconsin' Best Wurst platter was unbelievably great. My wife loved the onion straws. Loved the place."}
{"text":"great Friday fish fry (try the perch) and great cocktails.  Curtis is an incredibly skilled bartender."}
{"text":"Stopped here twice on a business trip. Great selection of local beer (I'm a craft beer enthusiast from NH). I kept getting beer samplers, they were served on a board shaped like Wisconsin. Fried cheese curds were great. Highly recommend the number 30, the egg on a burger sounds weird but is to die for! Friendly waitstaff, (beer) knowledgeable server."}
{"text":"Cheese curds with tiger blue sauce.....doesn't get much better than that"}
{"text":"Meh. I don't understand the draw. Yeah, they have good cheese curds. But they also have lots of greasy, uninspired food. And it is ALWAYS incredibly busy. I don't particularly like waiting in line for over an hour to have an ok burger. There are too many other great place on the square. Go to Coopers Tavern or Graze."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST walleye sandwich I've EVER had. Battered and fried to perfection, between two lovely slices of artisanal, toasted bread and with a sauce to DIE for. The kicker is that I've been a vegetarian for the past 6 years and I STILL make an exception for this mouthwatering sandwich. UGH. I want one right now.  They also have great service, amazing atmosphere and decor, and other wonderful menu items. Great craft beer selection."}
{"text":"I've been here on numerous occasions, half the time I've just been there to drink and I had a marvelous time.  The other half have been to eat, have a beer, watch a game or so.  Not the best.  They attempt to do the classic Wisconsin supper club, but with a Madison twist.  I'd say they more or less accomplish that, to good and bad ends.  Let me explain:  The interior is full of classic Wisconsin beer signs, the food is full of classic Wisconsin supper club food replete with fish fries and burgers  (and one with an egg on it).  The bartenders are friendly and the place is usually really full during evening dinner rush.  Very good selection of Wisconsin beers.  But... Wisconsin supper club food is a fatty, heavy, salty affair.  If you're into gut rot 40 minutes later, then that's awesome.  I was hoping they'd keep the Wisconsin attitude and type of food, but lose the grease.  They didn't.  It's a bit much.  And their namesake drink?  Well, they offer a couple interesting alternatives to the classic Wisconsin drink.  They even offer it with whiskey, ha!  But it's not the best old fashioned I've had.  It's probably not even in the top five.  I don't know how you mess that up, but I wasn't a fan.  So it's a cool interior but the food is really greasy.  So, yeah.  Good luck one hour after you've scarfed down that burger with the egg on top.  Wash it down with a mediocre old fashioned."}
{"text":"Great place to take friends or business partners from out of town.  Great food and drinks and a fantastic location.  Always a good time."}
{"text":"I had so many old fashioned's on the night I ate there that I forgot what I ordered.  I remembered it was very good.  I also remember seeing the Mac and cheese and thinking that I needed to come back for that."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a staple of Madison, and will continue to be one for many years to come. It is the epitome of a classic Wisconsin restaurant with over fifty beers on tap and a variety of dishes with great Wisconsin cheese. In addition, the Old Fashioned is a great place to go with a group of people since the atmosphere is filled with boisterous laughter and conversation.   In my opinion the Old Fashioned burger is the best burger you can get in Madison (yes even better than Dotty Dumplings). The soft-cooked egg tops off a burger with fried onions and bacon. I was skeptical at first it truly is something everyone should try once in their life.   The Wisconsin Beer Cheese soup is also a great dish, especially for those long winter months when you need something to stick to your ribs and warm you up at the same time."}
{"text":"A good place for burgers and fries. Try the old fashioned burger if you're ready for a mess. The cheese curds with paprika dipping sauce are addicting.   The Tom's Porter on Draft was a great choice, and the beer selection is pretty extensive, if you're looking for a local brew."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with some friends from out of town - the outdoor seating was nice and they have counter service at lunch instead of a waiter to take your order. We had the \"House Burger\" and the Sheboygan brats (doubles). Everyone was happy with their entrees, although with the soft-cooked egg on the burger the bun couldn't handle all the liquid - it quickly turned into a knife-and-fork meal."}
{"text":"I heard that this place had good burgers so that was enticing enough for my husband to come along and of course, for the beer too. The wait wasn't long and I like the atmosphere. I ordered some chicken tortilla soup and the fish taco special. My husband ordered a burger with bacon and hot pepper. Someone in the kitchen had a heavy hand with the salt because my soup was salty. My fish was not great either. In fact, it had a chewy texture and may have been possibly freezer burned. I could tell already my husband didn't like his burger since he only took a few bites and ate only the  bacon. I tried the burger myself and it wasn't anything special about it. oh, well. Service was good though and lots of beers to choose from."}
{"text":"Although I have read so many good reviews on this place, but I must say I was very disappointed.  The main reason is because it takes almost 40 minutes for our food to arrive.  And for some unknown reason, the table next to us (who ordered 10 minutes after us) got their food faster than us.  We went there on Sat. noon, and it wasn't terribly busy.  Sad face."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast, haven't had a dinner here but I'm sure it's great.  They focus on quality ingredients and serve a great Bloody Mary.  The daily scramble is a pretty great way to go, and why not have cheese curds with breakfast- it's Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  Great place to go with friends or with clients.  I work on the capital square and we order from The Old Fashion for all of our client meetings over lunch, clients LOVE the food!"}
{"text":"Good food, huge tap list & fun location. Parking is not convenient, but if you are going up to square you already know that."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Whenever we have guests visit us in Madison, we take them here!  Great environment with some traditional Wisconsin food.  We have eaten here 5 or 6 times and have never been disappointed.  The only downside is the incredibly long wait if you go during peak times (Friday and Saturday nights).  They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait at least an hour.  In terms of food:  Definitely need to try the cheese curds with tiger sauce.  Still have not found better curds.  All of their burgers are tasty, their cuban sandwich, sausage platter and mac and cheese are also winners.  If you're looking for a healthier options, their salads are also usually quite good.  If you're in Madison, you have to go here at least once!"}
{"text":"CHEESE CURDS.  All you need to know about this place? CHEESE CURDS.  Seriously, the curds at Old Fashioned may be one of the ten greatest foodstuffs in the United States of America. Their signature Old Fashioned (which they sell A LOT of) and regional/national beer list are pretty stellar too. But if you prepare yourself for the 45 minute wait, in which you should pull up a barstool and order the aforementioned Old Fashioned or a Spotted Cow, your taste buds will thank you later.  CHEESE CURDS."}
{"text":"cool atmosphere, great food, superb service. Real Wisconsin food! Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent Wisconsin food, great drinks and our service was absolutely amazing. They were so quick and kind with bringing out food promptly so our toddler wouldn't destroy the place. We loved it."}
{"text":"These are the best cheese curds in town, hands down! I was looking forward to less of a wait now that they've opened up their extension, but no luck. People love this place, and rightly so. You will have trouble getting a table. It is busy. However, if you are able to sit down, you will enjoy their delicious sandwiches (the pulled pork and grilled chicken are very good), platters (friday fish fry--yum!), lazy susans, and salads (delicious spinach and grilled salmon salads). A word of warning, the food can be a bit greasy/heavy, but it is comforting and craveable! If you sit at the bar, they have fantastic beer specials ($9 pitchers of a different wisconsin beer each month) and delicious drinks (house-infused organic raspberry vodka, anyone?). The bartenders are super nice, as are the servers. Only downside is the wait times, but hey.. the people have spoken."}
{"text":"After sifting through many Yelp reviews, we decided that The Old Fashioned would be the best place to stop for Sunday brunch. When we arrived there was about a 40 minute wait- they took our phone number and we were able to walk around the capital and State St. for awhile.  The restaurant was definitely busy but the staff handled the amount of customers wonderfully. Our waitress was quick and attentive to all her tables. I settled upon the bratwurst with fries for lunch. The brat tasted delicious and was served with brown mustard, onion and pickles which all complimented the flavors. I also picked some roasted garlic dipping sauce for my fries and it was so tasty. The decorations really add to the allure of The Old Fashioned. Great food, service and atmosphere make this a wonderful place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"UW grad. This is my go to place when visiting Madison. Doesn't take reservations but worth the wait and enjoyable at the bar."}
{"text":"So, were in Madison for a show at the Barrymore and had some time to kill walking around on a beautiful Fall afternoon.  I had to hit up Yelp to find some places to eat near the Capitol.  It was 5pm and we were starving (like \"I will cut you if you don't feed me now\" starving).   The 2 well respected and well reviewed restaurants on my list (L'Etoile and Harvest) were not open for dinner yet.  However, smack dab between these 2 restaurants was the unassuming, shining jewel of Wisconsin eats.  Enter: The Old Fashioned.  Immediately upon entering, I am greeted by one of my favorite smells: the wood-burning fire stove.  They had me at woodsmoke.  Then, we are completely overwhelmed with joy at the sight of the menu: totally classic and yummy Wisconsin food stuffs.  I may be biased since I am from Wisconsin, but this place is like total nostalgia, and it actually made me proud to be a cheesehead.  Word, Wisco.    Who knew there were so many beers brewed in WI?  We tried and enjoyed several.  And, we started off with one of the tempting and yummy (locally produced!) cheese plates.  Well played.  Then, we moved on to the main course: the house special burger (the one with the egg on top).  The hub chose a side of cheese curds (yes, they were very good), and I tried to retain a semblance of health with a side salad.  Fail...because then we ordered dessert.    People, you really need to try the \"Grasshopper\": vanilla ice cream with a few shots of creme de menthe (my dear old Dad used to make us the blended drink version).  So simple, yet so amazingly good.  And, the mint is really refreshing and palate cleansing after the super rich and fat laden meal.     We were totally stuffed, a little buzzed, but really happy and wood smoky by the time we left The Old Fashioned.  So, give it a go if you're in Madison and would like to sample the cuisine de Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because I was craving their cheese curds. Their cheese curds are actually one of the most amazing in the entire state. They don't use mozzarella cheese like other places, and their cheese just stretches and stretches. I got their macaroni and cheese, as well, which wasn't that tasty, but was a good price."}
{"text":"The place to go in Madison, if you want a tour of WI beers and good cheese curds. There on-tap list is impressive. It can get very noisy. Not a good place to go if anyone in your party has a gluten allergy."}
{"text":"Food was good, served quickly. Their Old Fashioned is decent and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The wife and I loved this place. We're not from Wisconsin, so having New Glarus beer on tap was a definite plus for us. The cheese curds were amazing and the food was pretty good too. We loved the service while waiting for a table. We gave them our cell phone number and they texted us when the table was ready. We loved the atmosphere, the quick service, and the food. We'll plan on going again next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Went to the OF to have dinner on 9/14--it was very busy but we got a table right away and ordered drinks.  While trying to decide what to order we noticed we could not hear each other from across the table.  Also the menu lacks dinner items and we were in the mood for real food.  Paid our check and ran to Tornados which was wonderful, as usual.  Doubt I'll ever come back. I don't need a restaurant to eat cheese."}
{"text":"The #50 is the way to go - Wood-grilled 16 oz. Rib-eye completely out-of-this-world. Great, friendly staff. The place was busy and non-stop for a Thursday night and we never felt crowded or overwhelmed. Had to try the house special Old Fashion Bourbon cocktail... delicious. Overall, a great spot for dinner and drinks right next to the Capital in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, but it is worth the wait.  They have a great atmosphere and good service.  Breakfast on Sundays is always fun."}
{"text":"Solid. Just love the concept and the menu.  Have been there twice in the last week and really enjoyed a tour through their menu.   Cheese flights were exceptional and the Lazy Susans were huge!  Their signature burger is WONDERFUL, but must pack about 3500 calories (Burger, Bacon, Cheese, Creamy Garlic Sauce, Soft Fried Egg... you get the picture). Overall the food is SIMPLE but Very Well Prepared and the service is impeccable. Can not say enough about their beer selection, something like 150 Wisconsin beers and like 30 are on tap.  What a great place!"}
{"text":"Okay....if you're into Old Fashioned drinks then this is the place to go! They have various Old Fashioned drinks and you can even create you're own! You can have it sweet or sour. Also, the food is pretty tasty. Since it's summer we went with the Summer Sausage sandwich with shoestring onions. It was yummy! The service was also excellent! We will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Totally amazing breakfast. Not crowded, awesome service. Sat at the bar. Cool old cafe style coffee cups and saucers....the best corn beef hash I've had in Madison. The jam was phenomenal as well. And as if the food wasn't good enough, they had Bob Wills playing at a modest volume on the speakers and espn and cable news on the flat screen TVs. I'm coming back for another breakfast very soon  Update: Had breakfast here again this week - and it was just as good."}
{"text":"Service here is extremely poor.  This place does not accept reservations so there is always a 40 minute wait for a table.  No doubt,the food is good but the hostess is always snooty and impatient.  I love their cheese platters and burgers."}
{"text":"I visited The Old Fashioned in Madison with my mom and my son after a long day exploring the nearby children's museum. There was a long wait at the door (which tells me that it would be good), so I grabbed a pager and waited outside.  After about 25 minutes (not too bad) we were paged and took a sit across from the bar in the back. I liked that this tavern had a coloring sheet for my son which he liked, but not as much as he loved the mirrors behind the booth. He watched himself and had his own little \"buddy\" for the longest time.  As for the food, it's great. We couldn't visit WI without ordering some delicious cheese curds and I had an Old Fashioned Burger - so good! All kids menu items are served with fresh fruit and my son also had yogurt - definite plusses for moms coming in with kids. In my opinion, The Old Fashioned is a MUST in Madison."}
{"text":"Had the spinach with bacon dressing salad for lunch, not so good. The hard boiled egg was so hard I couldn't cut through it with a fork. Very blah. Ate there once for dinner last winter and had a great experience. Sat in the window, watching the snow come down, with a sausage and cheese plate to munch on. Can't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Not good for groups. We had 23 walk in when the doors first opened for lunch. It took 75 minutes to get our food. Tables were being served and turned that came in 45 minutes after us. The food was good, our server was nice, but overall this was an unacceptable experience at an otherwise good restaurant. The manager comped our table's one appetizer and didn't seem concerned about the experience otherwise."}
{"text":"Good food, good staff. I've had good experiences here. The food is definitely a bit overpriced for how much food you get (especially with the cheese board) but overall I like this restaurant. I just wouldn't order the cheese board again. It's extremely expensive and you get a very small amount of cheese."}
{"text":"I ate here twice in two days. It was my first time in Madison and we were in town for the Ironman and needed a place to grab a quick lunch. Well, we ended up waiting 45 mins for a table, but it was worth the wait (and realize that I'm with three young kids!). Had a delicious cheeseburger and it was one of the best bar burgers I've ever had. Came back the next day and had another cheeseburger. High quality cheese curds too. EAT HERE."}
{"text":"This place is great. We waited about 45 min on a saturday night. We were able to go to the bar, have some drinks and wait. The whole time there we had great service. The food was amazing too."}
{"text":"A great place to meet and greet, but be prepared for a wait. I hit just over an hour on a Tuesday night.  The old fashioned Burger was a true taste of local grub."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was okay, but nothing special as I'd been led to believe. Fennel bisque was also just okay. Service was good, and I liked the atmosphere, but it's gotta be about the food. I'll give them another try at some point."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, a little bit nosy,nice food~the service is good as well~good for friends union"}
{"text":"Cheese curd heaven!  Great service too. Visited yesterday for lunch and George was our server.  This was my first time in Wisconsin and this place will be what I will miss the most!"}
{"text":"If you really really want cheese curds, ok.  Great.  Otherwise the noise will batter you into a headache.  Hard to believe people really love this annoyingly obnoxiously loud venue.  We simply won't put up with it."}
{"text":"Went here for their Friday Fish Fry and was it was a bit of a let down. The service was good but the food was definitely over-hyped. I know the cheese curds are supposed to be one of the best but for our group they were considered to be on the lower end of the Madison cheese curd spectrum. The quantity of food you get for the price is decent but the fish fry plate seemed to consist mostly of fries. Had 2 old fashioned's here- the first one was very sweet and weak but the second was a lot better. Overall it has a fun atmosphere and I'd go back to get a pitcher of beer but wasn't worth the hour wait for fish fry."}
{"text":"Excellent place to take anyone visiting Madison, food- and location-wise. Great selection of everything great in locally influenced food, but up a few notches in quality from usual bar food. Tends to get quite loud, however, so iffy if you really want to catch up with a visitor without perfect hearing."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, owned by personal friends.  That said, I know how much thought went into this place and it shows.  The best cheese curds in town, which should put them high in the running for best cheese curds in the universe.  The Lazy Susans are a great sconnie take on meze.  Egg-topped buger was fantastic.  This was my first liquid old fashioned experience.  They are tasty and come in various permutatations, the table favorite was made with applejack.  Ho-maid ice cream an excellent finish, recomend the buttered beer nut.  Lactose intolerants, veg, maybe vegans can find something."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed.  I remember this place being much better during my undergrad days.  Recently returned for a long weekend.  Old fashioneds were way too boozy.  Don't get me wrong, I can handle a stronger drink but this just tasted bad.  As for the food, the burgers were bland and the service was nonexistent.  It pains me to say this but I probably won't be back or recommend this once beloved Madison institution."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that if you're looking for authentic, hearty, quality \"Midwesterner\" food (or what I've dubbed a combination of lumberjack-style eats and German cookin') , The Old Fashioned is the place to go! It seems that most (if not all) of their food and beverage distributors are Wisconsin-based, which is nice for someone visiting the state's capitol. It has the look and feel of a Door County pub, without the bad cell reception and northern accents.   The food was tasty--the burger came out hot and the salad came out chilled. My husband claims that the old fashioned classic burger was one of the best burgers he's had in a long time (although he drowns pretty much everything in tabasco, so....your opinion may vary). I got a mixed greens salad which was basically like a salad you could get at any restaurant.   I gave the restaurant only four stars, however, because of a couple of things:  1. Very (VERY) poor selection for vegetarian and/or vegan patrons. Since the place isn't at all advertised as being vegetarian or vegan friendly, I guess we should have expected this, but usually you can find at least a few things that (with slight modificafions) are safe. Not the case here. All of the appetizers are meat or cheese based, and only a few entree selections (all salads) can really be considered a substantial entree after removing the chicken, fish, or beef. Seriously, vegans BEWARE. in the land of cheese, this place really makes no exceptions.  2. As a former waitress and bartender at multiple sports bars, I know how annoying it can be when people complain about the noise level in a restaurant (if you wanted a quiet evening, you should've STAYED AT HOME)! However, this was hands down the loudest restaurant I have ever been in. The place was almost full (but no wait list), and the tables were fairly close together, which wouldn't have been a problem if the music wasn't blaring in the background. My husband and I couldn't even have a constructive conversation because we couldn't hear each other over the sounds of our neighbors yelling across their tables trying to be heard over the noise. That DEFINITELY took away from the backwoods, mom-and-pop atmosphere of this place.   All in all, I wouldn't personally care to go back, but if I had guests in town looking to experience \"Real Wisconsin,\" this would definitely be a contender."}
{"text":"we popped in here for pre-dinner drinks.  I'm not an \"old fashioned\" drinker, but my husband is.  I had a glass of wine, which was nice, and my husband really enjoyed his Old Fashioned.  Very friendly here!  Our bartender was awesome."}
{"text":"BURGERS MADE IN HEAVEN, with cheese curds (which I've never heard of, maybe this is a Wisconsin thing? but they are gooooood) and onion rings (thin, crispy, couldn't stop eating those) on the side.   I have never cared less about table manners and gobbled down a burger this fast in my life."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast a few times.  Great food, reasonable prices, and a good Wisconsin atmosphere."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but this restaurant is amazing. My husband and I always come to this restaurant when we are visitng Wisconsin (we live in Illinois). The most favorite dishes that we love are the beer batter fried cheese curds and the award winning cheese platter. We also love the burgers that have thick patty and cooked medium-rare. Their drink options are so many, and they also do custom drinks with a reasonable price. On our last visit, we ordered fried cheese curds, award winning cheese platter, beer cheese soup, Wisconsin burger, the old fashioned burger, and brandy slush. And we spent less than $40 for all of those. This place is always crowded and packed though, but we will definitly visit this restaurant again when we are coming to Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"Before even stepping foot into the Old Fashioned, the joyous atmosphere is already palpable.  People waiting in line outside seem more like they are casually hanging out than waiting for a table.  I'm told that a table typically takes 20 to 30 minutes to open up, but it's possible to sit at the bar and order food as well--a much more attractive option if you are there alone or with one other person. The interior is dark wood, making for a tavern-esque feel.  The lighting is bright enough to see clearly, but dim enough to encourage socializing.  It feels a tad cramped, partially due to the sheer amount of people in the restaurant, but the skilled servers are able to deftly navigate despite the crowd. The service is prompt and friendly.  The bartenders are alert, and look around constantly to see if they can be of service.   I'm told that this particular restaurant serves over fifty different microbrews, all on tap, as well as the popular name brands as well.  Furthermore, they offer a beer of the month for only $2.50 a pint--a bargain! I started off with the cheese curds, which were made perfectly.  The breading was fried crisply for great flavor and textural contrast and was thin enough to let the cheese be the star.  The cheese itself was a perfect elasticity and size, with great flavor.  The dipping sauce I chose, paprika, was good but not fantastic; I had hoped for a stronger paprika taste. While waiting for my entrée, I ordered a spicy pickled egg of the bar menu, and it was the best choice I made all night.  The egg was presented plainly, but the taste spoke for itself.  The spiciness was infused into the egg and released slowly.  It did not overpower the egg, and the slow onset of the spice really helped to enhance the flavor of the egg and really synergized with the pickling. The specials for the night were tacos, pulled pork, roast chicken, and fried tilapia and I order one of each.  The tilapia was superb--really, I think the Old Fashioned has deep frying perfected.  The chicken was tasty, but was overpowered by the salsa roja; the pork, on the other hand, was dry and did not have enough salsa to cover up the dryness.  However, for the price of $1.50 per taco, I was well-satisfied. In terms of drinks, the Moon Man I had was delicious--a tinge of fruitiness and a little bitter counterpoint made for a very refreshing drink that helped to lighten the rich cheese curds.  I of course also had to try the namesake drink, a brandy Old Fashioned, which was as delicious as it looked.  The mashed up orange in addition to an orange slice garnish really helped to accent the brandy.  The Old Fashioned is definitely worth a visit, no matter who you are.  I have heard that their burgers are where they truly excel and I am eager to try them.  With very reasonable prices, especially for such tasty food, I have a feeling that this is place I will return to often."}
{"text":"Service was timely, food was excellent. #35 sandwich and cheese curds with Tiger sauce is highly recommendable"}
{"text":"A great Wisconsin restaurant.  Tons of local brews and great local fare make this a must visit.  Great fish fry, and a really cool atmosphere in the heart of Madison.  Offers good selection of beer, and some great local foods."}
{"text":"Admittedly we came here on a relativity busy night. When we arrived, we were told it would take 45min-1hr to seat us, wound up taking a full 2:15 hours (wtf?). We asked three times to make sure we hadn't been skipped, even though a party of four that arrived after us was finishing their food as we sat down. Once we finally sat, the host put us at the wrong table and asked us to move. Twenty minutes later our waiter showed up to take our food order. This was lackluster service to the max. Everyone apologized, but did nothing to make it any better. Having been a cook, I hate to review based on poor hosts and unresponsive wait staff alone.  Enough about the service, I came here based on the Yelp reviews for the food and beer. The prices for food are really cheap, and the quality of the meals are a marginal degree more worthy than the price of the food (if the prices are 'cheap' the food is 'not bad'). It was OK for a $9 plate of Mac and cheese, and the cheese plate had pretty good options on it. The food came out extremely fast relative to the rest of our experience here. All in all, it's alright in that regard, nothing to get too sweaty and excited about, definitely not worth 2 hours.  The beer selection is pretty solid, and I had a few glasses of beer which were fairly pleasing. The bar tender was really nice and very helpful in selecting brews while we waited for a table. She's the reason I didn't leave 1 star.  All in all the speed of the cooks and the decent beer kept this from being a total waste of time, but it was really, really close to being a waste of our entire evening. Would have rather just gone to a sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Excellent food in very generous portions plus stellar service!! I crave their chicken and biscuits! Love the atmosphere and the views of Capitol Square. The drink menu is very respectable."}
{"text":"They get 5 stars for their cheese curds and beer list alone!   We went on some what of a curd crawl and their's definitely stole the show! They had a perfect crust, a gooey center, and a dip sauce that didn't remind you that they are really just glorified mozzarella sticks, like marinara sauce.   They're beer list was praise worthy! It was really hard not to get an old fashioned like the rest of my group but the beer list had too many good looking sours, which happen to be one of my favorite styles! I settled my sour fix with Dave's Funk IV. I did try a taste of an old fashioned and loved the use of brandy in it.   We also tried the lazy Susan because it sounded different but after a night of drinking and curds, the pickled herring, eggs, and liverwurst were probably not the best mix!   I only wish I could have taken this bar home with me! So many beers I still wanted to try and cheese curds to later binge on!"}
{"text":"Call me boring, but I love the No. 37. Just a chicken sandwich, but a GOOD chicken sandwich. Perfectly cooked, wonderfully tender chicken on yummy bread. I made a few modifications, swapping the swiss cheese with cheddar and nixing the mustard, but it was still delish. Also love their haystacks and ALL of the dips. Have also had good service every time I've visited."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds in town! The rest of the menu is lack luster, IMO. Great place for an Old Fashioned, and some curds."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it has always been good! Would not recommend the chicken tacos (special on taco tuesday) very spicy and dry."}
{"text":"I was in town for a concert so I thought I'd give a local staple a try, but in the end I really had no clue why this place has such high ratings.   The service was decent but still somewhat aloof.  Now, onto the food. If all I said was that it was disappointing that would be an understatement, this was some of the most bland food I've ever had. I ordered the \"spicy\" burger, I'm using quotations because I don't consider just throwing some jalapeños on a regular burger making it \"spicy\". The fries were boring and below average, they reminded me of the kind you buy frozen at a grocery store. I tried some of my friend's mac and cheese and it was decent but I wasn't blown away. This is Wisconsin for Christ's sake, you guys make the best cheese in the country and this mac and cheese was barely better than Stouffers.   I will relent they do live up to their name and make a great Old Fashioned, but that alone was not enough to redeem this dining experience."}
{"text":"It has a great atmosphere. When we were there last two times, most tables were full. It seemed like a happy place, especially around 5-8 pm. Food is good. Service is immaculate. The prices are right."}
{"text":"Nowhere around the square is more Wisconsin than the old fashioned. When it is available, I've gotten the heirloom tomato BLT for lunch and dinner are more occasions than I would like to admit. The Wisconsin Benedict might be my favorite brunch meal in existence; especially when paired up with the Wisconsin bloody mary to start. Be warned though, brunch ends at noon on the weekends."}
{"text":"I read the 2/26 review posted by Jessie H. with interest, as on several occasions my family and I have experienced rude service from a female bartender at the back bar of The Old Fashioned.  I wonder if this is the same person who assaulted your friend??   It is too bad that one employee an be allowed to repeatedly ruin the experience of many.  We too will not be coming back until something is done about the service."}
{"text":"I really love the Old Fashioned!  They have my favorite burger in town with their signature burger. Bacon cheeseburger with an egg on top!  This place knows how to proper cook this type of burger and the key is how the egg is cooked!  The have it down perfect!  Also a great atmosphere, although a little loud when it is fully packed!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Incredible selection of Wisconsin (only?) beers. I tried Bedlam by Ale Asylum, at the bartender's recommendation, and was not disappointed. The fried cheese curds were worth getting but I could feel my arteries clogging as I ate them. I got the house burger, which comes with a fried egg on top, and was really good. I gave 4 instead of 5 stars only because the beef was merely above-average and the bread a bit crumbly."}
{"text":"We are Madison residents and this is our favorite restaurant in town.  It has a great balance of menu items, drinks, food quality, service, and prices."}
{"text":"AMAZING cheese curds and a great beer selection. A definate staple in Madison!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch on our long drive from Louisville, KY back home to Fargo.  All I can say is YUM!!  He is a fan of Shinerbock but tried the house Huber Bock and really liked it. I'm a bourbon barrel stout girl and tried the pumpkin spice bourbon barrel stout. Not a fan. Not because it wasn't presented well, I just didn't expect such a strong citrus flavor.   Husband ordered the house burger and was excited to find they serve an excellent dusseldorf mustard. He said the burger was very good but I'm thinking it could have been terrible and he'd have said he liked it because of the mustard!  I chose the roasted eggplant, Portobello , etc. sandwich and I have to say it's one of the better veggie sandwiches I've ever eaten. I could only get through half of it and it was still tasty the next day when I reheated it in a skillet at home!  We both had cheese curds on the side of our sandwiches and needless to say, they were fantastic!  Good service, great atmosphere and food at a decent price. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to get acquainted with Wisconsin's pride: Beer and Cheese.  Their tap selection is nearly intimidating for a non-local that's just diving into the wide array of charmingly named microbrews. My husband and I each had a flight of four snits and each one was more delicious than the last.  But what nearly had me making inappropriate noises in my seat was the Mac and Cheese. I wondered, \"How good can a NINE dollar Mac and Cheese be?\" I think I would have paid nineteen dollars for it...the creamy, buttery crunchy topped dish was incomparable."}
{"text":"One of the best stops in Madison for a burger, beer, and cheese curds. Wait can get long at times, but this place is a gem for anyone traveling or just wants some classic Wisconsin grub."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds of my life. Same goes for beer cheese soup. Basically, if you're into cheese, run don't walk to this restaurant.  Things to note: -Fairly large portion sizes, so keep that in mind when you order.  -Cheese curds -They have gluten-free bread, and 3 choices of it at that! -Prices are amazing. We had a FILLING meal for 4 people for under 70 bucks. -Did I mention cheese curds?"}
{"text":"Overrated on the square. Good if you want something deep fried down. Huge portions for brunch."}
{"text":"I've been to the Old Fashioned a bunch of times. The food is good, the beer selection is awesome, and it's a fun, lively place. But my last visit really sealed the deal for me. I ordered a dish at lunch that they only have on the dinner menu. They mistakenly charged me for and gave me the kids' version. When I told the server, they instantly took care of replacing the dish with what I had wanted, and would not allow me to pay the difference between the two. All done with total grace and courtesy.  There are a lot of places with good food, but the Old Fashioned adds in exemplary service. We'll be back. (Even though there are STILL long waits for tables, even after their expansion!)"}
{"text":"Third time may be the charm.  The last two visits were a disaster - 30 minute wait for my food or my meal was served uncooked.  The staff is friendly and apologetic but management don't listen.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a late lunch after touring the Capitol.  They had a 51 beers on tap (!!) and close to 100 in bottles.  We tried a local beer and ordered some grub.  The food (salad for me), was fine but nothing special.  The location of the restaurant and all the beers on tap (along with the ambience) definitely makes up for the food."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Old Fashioned.  The food was very good.  I had a chicken sandwich with dijon mustard, swiss cheese, and smoked bacon.  It comes with a side, I picked the salad, which had an awesome dressing.  We also got the cheese curds, which I highly recommend.  It was very busy, and the service was great regardless."}
{"text":"Really nice selection of local beers. The special was a very good deal, and the chosen beer (a seasonal New Glarus when I was there) was very good. The cheese curds were, as everyone says, really tasty and it was nice to have the choice of some interesting sauces. My meat eating companions assured me the burgers were really good. Got the eggplant and portobello sandwich which was nice, but not particularly special and I would probably not get it again. But I'll definitely be back for beer and cheese."}
{"text":"Overrated is the first word that comes to mind here. Often crowded, very few vegetarian/vegan options and a hit-or-miss wait staff. The major pro here: showcasing local, Wisconsin ingredients!"}
{"text":"Pretty casual bar-type place, with really good bar food."}
{"text":"We come quite a bit for lunch.  Friendly service....very good \"comfort\" food.  The chili and walleye are pretty friggin' good.....so are the Bloody Mary's.  I don't think we've ever had anything that sucked there.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Madison. Delicious drinks and favors locally sourced foods. Would highly recommend to both locals and visitors!"}
{"text":"Sweet spot for beer lovers. Brats good too & bartenders very friendly & knowledgable."}
{"text":"Loud and crowded place. We waited for almost two hours in the chilling Madison wind and finally got a table by the door. The food is simply amazing. One star down for the waiting time."}
{"text":"The cheese curds are one of the best you'll find in the entire state.  Burger with fried is egg is messy but PHENOMENAL!  Fries are also excellent.  Would get 5 stars instead of 4 except service can be iffy at times and if you get a table near the door (in winter) it is cold and drafty.  Be prepared to wait if you go during lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent bang for you buck! Good pub style food. Great beer selection. Loved the atmosphere. Perfect place to meet up with a few friends on a weeknight and eat good food and have drinks on a cold wintery evening. The food was great and definitely comforting on a snowy day. Loved it. There are gluten free options as well!"}
{"text":"We watched many an old fashioned being concocted as we sat at the bar in this establishment.  Upon walking in, we were told there would be about a 40 minute wait.  It was a Saturday evening, and, as there were many beers worth trying on the menu, we were fine with the wait.  A few minutes after we stood near the bar area, a set of seats opened up that could accommodate the four of us.  The bartender (Curt?) informed us that he was a \"big deal\" after one of us expressed concern that we should stick with the first bartender who tried to wait on us before we had decided upon what to order.  This bartender, who could tell we were knowledgeable about beer (after all, the beer list was what attracted us to this restaurant in the first place) offered many samples to help us make our selections.  If we asked for one sample, he often returned with two.  More than one of us ended up picking something he had recommended.  My favorite, by far, was the mudpuppy porter with ice cream.  If we had been hungry for dessert at the end of our meal, I would have just ordered that.  It was absolutely delicious.  As for the dining experience, when our buzzer alerted us to the fact that we'd have to leave the bar to be seated, we decided to just stay at the bar to eat instead.   One member of our group ordered a lazy Susan.  It was way more than one person could eat, but filled with delicious munchies.  Two people had burgers, one of them the Old Fashioned burger with the fried egg.  Both of those people enjoyed their selections.  I had the summer sausage sandwich.  While I did enjoy it and would order it again, I expected the sausage to be cut thicker.  It was also heated, which I did not expect.  The fries were thin and delicious as well.  If I visit Madison again, I'd definitely come back.  The location on the square is convenient, service was excellent, and I thoroughly enjoyed the evening."}
{"text":"Best place in Madison if you eat there once a month. Not so great if you eat there every day.  Drinks are beyond amazing and priced beautifully in the Wisconsin fashion. Waitstaff is plentiful. Atmosphere is perfect.  Everything has cheese in it, and I mean it. I will go there for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at the Old Fashioned! The cheese curds are the best in Madison, and the dips they come with are delicious! The restaurant is quite busy at dinner time, but it's the perfect location for an afternoon lunch or late night drink. Also, karaoke!"}
{"text":"Many of the ones that I mention The Old Fashioned to always commented \"very Wisconsin.\"  Well, I don't know exactly what that meant, but I was most impressed by the cheeses.  The Cheese Curd was really good.  We also had a platter with 3 different types of cheeses.  One was cheddar; the other one had a beer flavor; I forgot the other one, but they were all very good!  If great cheese is what is meant by \"very Wisconsin,\" then I am all for it!"}
{"text":"I had my first certified grass fed beef burger here and I must say it does taste different though I would not say it tastes better, just different. I have sampled the old fashioned burger and cheese curds with varying dipping sauces. The food was good. Hefty portions. This is definitely one of the better burger joints in town.  The place itself is a pretty small establishment so they really pack everyone so its not the best place to bring many children at the heavier trafficked times of the day but don't let that deter you. Just wanted to give you a heads up."}
{"text":"I love The Old Fashioned! The fried cheese curds are probably my favorite in the entire city of Madison. The drinks are really great and I love the environment. I've been coming to The Old Fashioned for 8 years now and it never gets old."}
{"text":"The food there is excellent and not expensive. The only down side is that we have to wait for one hour and half in a thursday night...Hope things can get better after their expansion work."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection (all Wisconsin breweries).  Had an amber ale that really hit the spot.  Stopped in for lunch, so all I  looked at was the sandwich menu, and it all looked great.  Good prices too.  Most under $9.  I was in the mood for something light, so I got the grilled vegetable sandwich (okay, I admit it).  It was very good, except the eggplant skin was too tough to bite through, so I had to take it out and cut it up with a knife.  Still I would recommend this place. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  View of the capital building (site of all the political protests recently about teachers collective bargaining rights being stripped).  Still a lot of signs up of people supporting the teachers."}
{"text":"I loved the energetic atmosphere but the food was just ok.  The thin fries are out of a freezer bag and taste accordingly like any fast food fries.  The salad was generous and nice.  The turkey sandwich was mediocre, large but no pizzazz, it seemed just turkey and cheese, no avocado, nothing fresh, no bacon, truly old fashioned but not in a good way.  I would compare it to a Denny's."}
{"text":"I resisted going to The Old Fashioned because every person I met in Madison (I'm new here) had asked me if I had been yet and I hate things like that. I finally caved in for date night about 2 weeks ago and now I get it. We arrived at 6 pm on a Wednesday and got THE LAST TABLE open... at 6 PM. ON A WEDNESDAY. Amazing. Once I sat down and had impeccable service with even more comforting & delicious food, it all made sense. The house salad dressing is out of this world good and the fish fry was delicious. Crispy, fresh, and homemade without a hint of fishy-ness. The coleslaw was crisp and not gross. My boyfriend's burger was cooked perfectly to his liking. My only regret was that we didn't save room for dessert, and next time we will surely split an entree so that we do."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is definitely a popular restaurant with what seems like a constant flow of people. We visited on a Thursday night for a late dinner (around 8:30) and still had an hour wait in front of us because of how busy the place was! But, the restaurant was highly recommended by several friends as a place to get good, traditional Wisconsin food so we decided to wait it out.   When we were seated, the staff was attentive and nice.  We shared a cheese plate as an appetizer and I ordered No. 36, a beer battered walleye sandwich, as my entree. The cheese plate was unique and a good sampler of four local cheeses. On the other hand, my fish sandwich lacked flavor and salt. My co-workers ordered the Old Fashioned House Burger and No. 56, the Thursday Night Special (a HUGE portion of food). Both seemed satisfied with their meals. Overall, good food but nothing amazing.   Also, if you are vegetarian, be warned that there are very few options available here for you!"}
{"text":"Been twice for lunch. Always busy , but has great food and speedy service!"}
{"text":"We stopped by late morning one Saturday for a bloody mary, having read they have one  of the best in town.  The place was pretty busy - lots of people crowding tables for breakfast, but we were able to find a spot at the bar.  We ended up waiting about 10 minutes before we were noticed.  Strike one.  The bloody mary itself was the absolute worst I've ever had.  I fully admit I'm not a fan of horseradish, but I can handle it in moderation.  The Old Fashioned bloody, however, was just teeming with it.  That wouldn't have been the end of the world, except that the mix had only the slightest hint of tomoato flavor.  Overall, the drink tasted like water and horseradish.  Gross.  I pushed the drink aside, as there was no way I was going to drink it.  The bartender came back about 20 minutes later.  She asked if we were done, and I said yes.  She then took the completely full drink away without saying a world.  Wouldn't you think to maybe ask if something was wrong with it?  Yeah, I would too.  She dropped off the check, we paid, left, and will never return.  Yes, I should have said something about how terrible the bloody mary was, but I also believe that any halfway experienced bartender would also know to ask when a patron is obviously not pleased with a drink.  I'm sure this is a great place for breakfast, and I've had good beer & reasonably good food her in the past.  But if it's a bloody mary you want, please take my advice and go elsewhere.  Unless you really, really love horseradish & water."}
{"text":"Love it! Whenever we have visitors from out of town, we take them here. Love the beer cheese soup and the cheese curds! Also their burgers are delicious. If someone is looking for a good \"Wisconsin\" eating experience, The Old Fashioned does not disappoint..."}
{"text":"I love this place for brunch, but am not very impressed with their dinner menu.. They only have a few entrees and the rest is mostly sandwiches, which isn't ideal for dinner. They have really great cheese curds though.   DO NOT get the chili, it is absolutely disgusting and basically just meat sauce/sloppy joe. Very disappointing.. And it was served cold."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Wisconsin. The cheese platter did not disappoint. Definitely served Midwestern style with store bought cheap crackers, but then again, it is a cheese platter and the cheese was awesome.   I also ordered the house burger. It was delicious.  Great place to go with friends. Very upbeat and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant to grab a beer and a sandwich. Everything I've ever tried has been stellar. The beer list is the best in Madison. It is a must-bring to everyone that comes to visit."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned a été le lieu de notre premier repas au US. La barre a tout de suite été placée très haut pour les hamburgers.  Le restaurant est fréquenté par un clientèle d'habituée, des étudiants (à Madison c'est le moisns) et autres. C'est grand et plutôt chaleureux. Le service est gentil et prévenant. Et les hamburgers sont très bons ainsi que les cheese curds  (cheddar frit) et le choix de bières parfait. Bien sûr tout est très copieux ! Execellente adresse"}
{"text":"Best beer selection on the square and amazingly affordable for the location.  Any person new to the Madison area needs to add this place to their \"places to go\" list.  Keep in mind, you have to order an old fashioned at the Old Fashioned.  When they ask, you want it brandy and sweet."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch and left extremely happy. The cheese curds with tiger sauce were the best I've ever had. I loved the New England clam chowder, which I normally don't care for. The Old Fashioned burger is something I wish I could bring back home. It was perfectly seasoned, and the complement of the garlic sauce and yolk of the soft egg made me fall in love with this burger. A seat next to the window also provides an amazing view of the Capitol building."}
{"text":"Hey hey whadda say, it's a great place for a drink today!"}
{"text":"I was there friday night, it was packed and amazing. Environment was very nice, bar tender was very nice. Best cheese curds ever, never had a burgur like this, fresh and juicy."}
{"text":"Dined here Saturday, February 11th and the cheese curds were excellent, sandwich was great and they offer an impressive beer selection.   However, we were seated next to 4 intoxicated 'adults' that chose to throw food at each other as well as other tables. They were loud, rude, confrontational and oblivious to the scene they were causing with their childish behavior. Once their drinks were cut off at the bar they became even more combative and belligerent. I can't give enough credit to the manager and wait staff as to how they handled the situation. They went above and beyond to be nice to these deplorable delinquents while also apologizing to nearby patrons for the disruption.   The confrontation lasted over 30 minutes and ruined the atmosphere and experience for everyone within 15 feet of these gross people. The courteous, calm staff set an example of basic human decency that the children of these patrons will never experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the Midwest.  Always make it a point to visit whenever I'm in Madison. And, like most excellent restaurants, there is often and almost always a wait.  It's just great comfort food and hands down the best deep fried cheese curds I've had.  Here, too, I've brought many a coworker and customer and everyone has been a fan.  All the food has been decent from the salads to the burgers, brats, BBQ pork and turkey sandwiches to the tuna salad and fish.  Nothing that blew me away, but all good and all consistent.  My favorite part of the place is the bar. Just a really cool, old school/antique bar that runs 30 feet or so towards the back of the place.  An amazing beer selection as well as an outstanding selection of very original \"WI foods\" like beef jerky and pickled eggs.   Great location as well with a view of the Capitol building across the street along with being in the middle of a bustling area of other restaurants and bars."}
{"text":"LOVE their breakfast scrambles, potatoes and grapefruit old fashioned, especially after meandering the farmer's market. Service is generally fast even though they are usually busy. The noise level can be sometimes high however, the food is well worth the small annoyance."}
{"text":"The old Fashion is a great local burger and bar place with a great ambience and atmosphere to all!! The service is great and friendly! The food is good with many local Wisconsin options!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Madison, by far. Go early to be sure you can get a table; if you try getting in at prime time on a Friday or Saturday, you're SOL. But once you're in, you're definitely in for a treat. They have the best cheese curds in town, hands down. For an entree, you can't go wrong with a burger, salmon salad or the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The warm mini donuts, mimosas and bloody mary's are delicious for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Beer battered walleye sandwich and deep fried cheese curds were excellent! Tons of local beers on tap. Bar service was great as well. Will be back again on my next stop in Madison."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous :)  On a weekend trip to Madison with some girlfriends, we stopped at this place. Three separate times, actually.  Highlights: beer cheese soup (we actually used it as dip for the french fries, SO GOOD), fried cheese curds (manna from cow heaven), and $9 pitchers of New Glarus. (coming from the NY/NJ area, this was reverse sticker shock for me)  Bartenders are extremely efficient and friendly, wait service is great. There can be a long wait on the weekend, but it's worth it! Great hangout!"}
{"text":"Fun, signature Madison restaurant. Prices are very reasonable too for the Wisconsin sized portion."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is of the most delightful restaurants in Madison.  A 'Sconnie-style restaurant?  You got it here.  What you'll find here is tasty food that'll probably clog your arteries--but well, who cares!  Because the food at The Old Fashioned is so good, that eating healthy will be the last thing on your mind.  Everything served is local--from their cheeses, sausages, meat, and beer.  I will admit that things have changed a bit since they first opened (the No. 30 Hamburger is a bit smaller than I remembered), but I will still keep coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Overall, the food here was okay; it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. The cheese curds were good although they were pretty greasy and salty. The bread on the veggie sandwich was too buttery and the amount of fries that came with the dish was disappointing, especially when the people next to our table had a plate full fries on THEIR veggie sandwich! The mac and cheese was bland..nothing awesome about it. This place was okay, but not somewhere I would go back to because the food was quite mediocre."}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried the famous Wisconsin beer cheese soup, and it was delicious. So cheesy and sooooo good. I had the regular burger, which was delicious with the fried egg and bacon on it. The patty was so thick and it really tasted like quality beef. Also the beer selection was awesome, with numerous local beers and at least 30 beers on tap. It was quite hard to decide but the Spotted Cow beer was a nice compliment to all of the cheese I had."}
{"text":"Excellent service very friendly and courteous staff if I am ever in Madison again I will be there. Highly recommended !!"}
{"text":"Best cheese curds of any place in Madison. Hands down."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned, totally rocks for its bar, restaurant, and awesome location at the epicenter of Madison.  It goes without saying that their Old Fashions are awesome, every food item I've ever tried in my 3 visits to the place has been delicious (especially the cheese curds).  A kick butt selection of Beers from Sconee to boot!!! Great place to come to meet friends or with the family. I'll be back the next time I'm in MadTown for a game or a visit."}
{"text":"Greasy, heavy food with no plant-based options. It's where the obese Madisonites stop to graze when their angina starts bothering them as they attempt to walk the capitol.   Switch to plant-based foods and overcome your diabetes, heart-disease, and obesity epidemics, Madison."}
{"text":"Had Brunch on a weekend. The wait time was 5 mins;  The food was served hot and quickly.The waiter helped with the menu choices and kept the coffee cup full. We had the Cheese platter, eggs and toast, Eggs Benedict with bratwurst. Really good value."}
{"text":"Best Old Fashioned I've had, with a great price. Great food with a great atmosphere. I've been here for lunch and dinner and loved it both times! Ive had the spicy burger and the prime rib sandwich and both were beyond good! The spinach and stravecchio salad should not be missed! I'd drive up from IL just to go here!"}
{"text":"Consistently good. Flavorful burgers, good beer, nice armosphere. I have been there twice,  and plan to go back."}
{"text":"We sat by the window and had a nighttime view of the Capitol! Pub food is easy to come by in Madison, so we didn't feel like we were getting anything special here. We had no complaints though."}
{"text":"Given our experience on the evening of 26-Jan, I was very surprised to see this place get 4 stars.  Granted that the food was between good and very good, however the service was between bad and very bad.  Waitress attention was minimal, a meal was requested without onions but came with onions, and the bill was asked to be split between food and drinks and was not.  When the onion issue was pointed out the waiter set the plate down anyway.  From just the one experience I could not recommend this place to out of towners."}
{"text":"My Family of 5 is never disappointed with the food, service or ambience. Best cheese curds ever!"}
{"text":"What the heck do you say about a place with 1200 reviews and an overall 4-star rating that hasn't already been said?   Without going back through all of them, let me give you two words: Lazy Susan. I honestly think this is the best-kept secret of The Old Fashioned.   One night awhile back, I was partying backstage at the Bartell with my castmates from Misalliance. We were STARVING, but didn't want to leave the cozy confines of the green room (and, more importantly, the beer and wine in the backstage fridge) to get something to eat. A couple folks said, \"We'll go get some stuff from the Old Fashioned and bring it back.\" I handed them some bills and said, \"Get a No. 6.\" \"What's that?\" \"It's one of their lazy Susans.\" \"Their what?\" \"Trust me - just order it.\"  Basically, the number 6 is everything you'd find set out as an appetizer before a holiday dinner in Wisconsin - cheese spread, braunschweiger, smoked trout, creamed herring, salami, deviled eggs, pickles - plus crackers and rye bread. It actually comes on a lazy Susan - so you can twirl it in the middle of the table for easy sampling. If you order it to go, they have a special lazy Susan go container for it, too. It doesn't twirl, but who cares. What's on it is going to disappear so quickly, it won't matter. And you will be very, very happy.  One word of caution: it's a lot of food. Depending on their appetites, a few people could make a whole meal out of the thing. Two people will not finish a number 6. Three people will not finish a number 6. You get the idea.  So why not five stars? Well, frankly - as many times as I've been to the Old Fashioned, I can tell you that sometimes the service isn't the friendliest. I know the place is always hopping and, by the end of the night, their servers' puppies have to be barkin' pretty loudly. But please smile at me - I will tip you well."}
{"text":"Great place for cheese curds and their namesake drink. Most of the food is enough for two people to share, especially the Friday fish fry. I've had most of the fish and vegetarian things on the menu and they were all good. Only downside is it is pretty loud around dinner time so sometimes it is difficult to talk and there is often a 45 minute wait for a table."}
{"text":"I recently have found a new love for old fanshions and thiers didn't dissapoint.  More about that later...A friend of mine were driving back from my lake house and we decided to stop here for some drinks and food.  The place was packed when we walked in and had about a 30min wait for a table...this doesn't bother me because I work in the same industry and you really need to piss me off for me not to like you...That being said we walked around their two bars trying to find a couple open chairs..no luck.  Soo..what do you do?  GRAB A BEER!  I starred blankly at their menu of beers for a good 10min before ordering and was plesnely suprised by lake fronts ipa.. delishious!  My friend got the new glaurs totally naked and it was on special for $2.50!  SWEET!  Eventually a couple bar stools came available and we scooped them up extremely quick.  By that time it was time for...yep another beer...seeing how long it took me to order the first i decided to grab a flight of 8..hehee..all WI beers and all were pretty good..the barback was cool and chatted with us a bit and didn't mind running from bar to bar to pour the flights (i guess you can only order beer flights from one side..hmm..whatever)   Food:  fried cheese curds..bomb...lake trout...bomb  night cap was an old fashion ordered by my lady friend so it was a sweet but frickin good!    The Old Fashioned is a must stop if in Madison!"}
{"text":"The hype about the cheese curds is true.  They are that good.  The place would get a 5-star from me on them alone if not for all of the other great meals they served up.  They're all about being Wisconsin, and I can't imagine anyone else doing it better.  Get there early, but get there somehow.  This place is a real treat.  Also, if you don't get to Wisconsin often, make certain that you get a flight of Wisconsin beers.  Your server will select them for you if you give a little direction.  Oh, and don't forget the fried pickle spears--crispy on the outside, pickley good on the inside."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review with \"I am not a native Wisconsinite\".  I don't even drink Bloody Marys.  The food is pretty good.  You have to be in the mood for sandwiches or a greasy food.  The cheese curds are good, but not my favorite in town.  The bar food menu is interesting and I do love their popcorn."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds in Madison! Great menu. Lots to choose from. Friendly service. Great selection of beers, too. Went here straight from the airport."}
{"text":"I would definitely stop by again when i'm back in wisconsin =)   i went there for lunch and it was getting really crowded. it was a neat restaurant that offers a TON of beer selection!!!  the service was ok.    i ordered the Old Fashioned House Burger.  Their burger was sooo big that i had to eat with fork and knife!!!!  soft cooked egg oozing over thick slices of bacon and topped with fried onions.... it's a perfect combo!!! garlic sauce enhaced the whole experience... oh so good!!!! their bread was so yummy... oh gosh i'm drooling as i type this! i usually don't rave about hamburgers but i'm totally raving this one!!!!  Mmmmm... cheesecurds... that was the main attraction and i'm so glad i did~  i had to bring some back to California!!! it was quite tasty!!!  it was a bit salty in my opinion, but loved the chewy inside!! almost reminded me of fried mozarella but with more flavor!! i wonder if i can make this at home =)   If you're in the area or driving through the capital, totally should stop by this place and try their food!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at The Old Fashioned for several years, and have never been disappointed!  It is good old Wisconsin comfort food at its best, with appetizers that include Wisconsin's Best Wurst Platter, Soups that include Wisconsin Beer Cheese Soup garnished with Popcorn (yes, really!), Entrees that include The Old Fashioned Burger, grilled over a live fire and topped with fried onions, Bavaria's hickory-smoked bacon, aged Cheddar, garlic sauce and a soft-cooked egg on a buttered and toasted roll...  How good is that!  Don't eat here if you worry about cholesterol!  They also have great cheese curds!  The ambiance is of a bustling and lively place, with a great selection of beers.  It just doesn't get better than this!  Another Madison great!"}
{"text":"A little overhyped in my opinion.  Good burgers but not the greatest I've had.  Fun atmosphere and solid experience but could do work a little on diversification of their menu items."}
{"text":"Was there with large group Sat in front and every time some one came thru from door we got a frigid breeze Awful!!!! Wedge salad with grilled chicken good Homemade chips excellent 2 people in our group had to send spilt pea soup back because too salting Friendly wait staff"}
{"text":"The burgers as well as the Old Fashioned drinks are really good. Parking is hassle (as with anywhere downtown). Be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Seems to be living off of its institutional status. Most everything has been said.   The burgers are amazing. The grass fed beef and commitment to local produce is impressive. This might just be the best grass fed burger we've ever had. Quite unbelievable.   Why not 5 stars? $1 up-charge for tomato on a regular burger. That's a bit cheap. Especially when you ask for no cheese and you paid for the cheese. At least it turns out this is an heirloom tomato because it is in season. So that's a plus. It was a really good slice of tomato!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere for Badger game day!  Great cheese curds and chili!  Great service too!"}
{"text":"The service was almost as great as the food. We had an incredible server who made great recommendations and suggested specials. Good thing because everything was the best. There was an amazing Sunday special of impecibly seasoned chicken, stuffing and potatoes. YUM! We also had fried cheese curds. Duh, it's WI. And a house brew beer to accompany. Will be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Came here two days in a row for breakfast and brunch- Enough said?  Eggs were perfect, toast and peach jam and rosemary potato!! Yummy"}
{"text":"Delicious food, but do not expect to run a mile after enjoying a buttery sandwich with cheese curds on the side. The name describes the ambiance, especially in regards to the bar. Expect it to be fairly busy, as it is on \"the square\". They also serve breakfast, but I find the lunch/dinner menu more unique."}
{"text":"I really love the Old Fashioned's atmosphere and their food.  They are part of the slow food movement, relying on local, organic produce whenever possible, and they take great pride in what they do. The restaurant is a gourmet showcase of all things Wisconsin with prices to fit all budgets.  The generous cup of Green Bay chili costs only about $4.50 and will come very close to filling you up.  Get a tap beer while you are there and you've escaped for less than $10.  They have a long, luxurious wood bar, and nearly everything on the menu is very good."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, service is slow and not the most friendly bunch I've ever been around."}
{"text":"great cocktails and food! a must place to visit if you visiting town!"}
{"text":"Wow this is really not worth the wait.  Everyone recommends it I guess because it is so well known.  Staff are very rude.  They seem to think they are \"all that\".  Mediocre experience, way to loud and not worth the wait to get a table."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a great place for groups. They have a variety of sandwiches and daily specials that cater to whatever need you have. Our table ordered a side of cheese and crackers (came with three types of cheeses that were all fantastic), and a variety of sausage that came was also awesome. They make some very soft macaroni and cheese that is topped with bread crumbs. It comes in a mini boat style plate that comes with a large quantity of macaroni and cheese. Their prime rib sandwich is average (the meat is fairly tender but doesn't go too well with the bread and it also comes out extremely juicy which makes the bread a bit soggy).  They also have a wide range of drinks. Their hard apple cider shot is really good. It balances that cider taste with a slight bit of alcohol."}
{"text":"I have only been for brunch but it is very good.  They have a version of eggs benedict using a brat patty instead of canadian bacon which is out of this world.  Also their potatoes are awesome, I think they are battered and deepfried with rosemary.  I also had the special which involved sage sausage and onions scrambled eggs and cheddar, much of which supposedly came from the farmers market right outside the door.  Its more casual than I expected after reading reviews here."}
{"text":"Absolute...... Best old fashioneds on this side of the Mississippi!!!! If you come to Madison you absolutely have to come here! They also have really good cheese platters!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the most underrated burger in Madison (the one that comes with Bacon and a fried egg).  Just try it and thank me.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Great location, cool ambiance, attentive staff, FANTASTIC beer selection! My husband and I just stopped by for a few drinks, The Old Fashioned has a great two for one happy hour. There are tons of beer on tap (maybe a couple dozen?) and they're all Wisconsin brewed. I'll definitely go back next time I'm in Madison to try some stuff off the really good sounding menu (lots of cheese, no surprise there!!!)."}
{"text":"Service is always slow, and it's always packed, but the food is worth it.  Try the cheese curds, even if you think that's not your thing.  They're heavy and you feel stuffed, but they're the best cheese curds in Wisconsin (and trust me, I've hunted!).  YUM!"}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is so Wisconsin. The food is great and so is the beer! They are known for their cheese curds, so if you love cheese and you love anything fried, try them! This is the go-to place for when you're visiting Madison, or you have friends in town - great atmosphere (can get loud) and it's right on the Cap Square. They also offer a rewards card, though I always forget to use mine. Ha!   One warning, no matter the time or day of the week, expect a lengthy line - people are always waiting to get in. Regardless of the wait, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"awesome steak and great time.. tried the cheese curds and cheese platter followed by steak. aviation martini at the end. food was really good. great ambulance. would come here again.."}
{"text":"This was one of our first experiences upon moving to Madison, and even a takeout order of two sandwiches and cheese curds was amazing! Service was very friendly and everything was ready in time and hot. We look forward to trying more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Nummy nummy num! Deliciousness is everywhere, from the bar to the tables. Don't miss the Saturday morning brunch during farmers markets! I've never had anything that wasn't wonderful. Just don't go there if you're in a hurry, because there's almost always a wait for a table!"}
{"text":"Visited here with some colleagues last month. As someone not from the WI area, it seemed like a very typical bar and restaurant. It is located near the Capitol, and was definitely crowded and we had a bit of a wait before we had a table. A few of us got drinks and cheese curds while we waited. I will remember the Old fashioned and the first place I have ever tried cheese curds as well the first time I actually enjoyed a beer! Since it was the first time I ever had cheese curds, I didn't really have anything to compare it with. While anything fried is always good, their cheese curds were intense and a bit on the saltier side. I prefer the cheese curds at other locations in the area. Even though I normally don't like beer, I also decided to try some of the WI beers they had, and the bar tender let me try a belgian red cherry beer from New Glarus that was delicious! For dinner, I ordered a Mac and cheese which while good, did not stand out for me."}
{"text":"The old fashioned can be ordered in many variations, and is delicious. The beer cheese soup was really good, and the salad with door county cherries was tasty too. Great service even though it was super busy. Great Madison ambience."}
{"text":"While I am not obsessed with this place like some people are, I do really like it.  The menu is not huge, so it is a bit hard for a picky eater (and not so much meat lover) like me to find something to eat sometimes.  That being said, everything I have had there has been very good.  The things that I do really love there: The drinks, and the cheese curds.  Definitely top notch.  Also worth noting:  the place is so popular that really whatever time you go to eat it will be crowded, and it will be a bit noisy."}
{"text":"First off, I really hate waiting around for a table, so the fact that I go here even when they don't take reservations should tell you something.  The Mr. and I have been here several times, weekends mostly, and I'm always up for their Friday fish fry.  Can't remember which night (Tues, mayhap?) but Taco Night is also interesting, in a good way.  You must order whatever the drink special of the evening is- each time I've been amazed at old Wisconsin drinks I've never heard of before.  Bartenders are attentive and friendly, the location's great and I've never had a bad meal or experience here."}
{"text":"There is just soooo much here....the menu is vast, the beer and liquor is vaster.    But since I've been coming here on the regular for the last six years, the singular item I have come to appreciate is the $1.50 beef jerky.  This has got to be the most under appreciated item on any menu in any Madison restaurant.  The saltiness revives your palette for the next craft beer.  The protein sates you.  The leathery texture builds jaw strength.    So while I could ramble on about the curds, the burgers, the fish-fry, the whiskey, the lazy susans - I am just going to leave you with two words:  bar meat."}
{"text":"Get the fish fry every time, whether it's Friday or on the sandwich any other day.  It's simply the best there is!"}
{"text":"High quality low brow eats. My first time in Madison. I went for the deep fried cheese curds - creamy and delicious - then a BLT with farm fresh lettuce and heirloom tomatoes. Fantastic. There's a great craft brew list but I washed mine down with a couple of bottles of Miller High Life. Perfect."}
{"text":"What a dumpster!  I've been here twice.  Will NEVER COME AGAIN!  I came with my wife and a friend of hers to have a drink while they ate dinner.  I brought my own food due to my food allergies and I was told I had to leave.  I came here once before all of my food allergies and had cold terrible food and was seated by the door in the winter and froze my butt off.  NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots in Madison. Great for lunch or dinner. Get the Wisconsin cheese soup!  Evenings the bar is a good place to take in some Wisconsin microbrew's."}
{"text":"I believe it was Public Enemy who said \"Don't believe the hype!\" The place is good. Good concept. Good service. Good food. But a 2+ hour wait for two? A 1.5 hour wait for two on a Saturday at 2:00 PM? I mean, the place is good, but I have to suspect that something is amiss with table/time management. For all the good it has, I don't think I'd wait more than half an hour with all the other fine establishments nearby. That's exactly what my friend and I did both times. We were pleased with our meals and service elsewhere - including a nearby vendor cart. Honestly, don't wait more than 30 minutes - otherwise, you're just a fool."}
{"text":"Love the cheese curds!!  Best in Madison. Menu selection is huge but everything is so good. Waited 30 min for a table last Friday we went, but worth it!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great drinks! Great beer on tap! It's very hard to have a conversation at TOF. Bouncy sound."}
{"text":"Typical Midwest Bar, bar food and of course Old Fashioned in 8 different variations. Crowd is mostly college students and some \"professional drinkers\". Great place to inhale the Wisconsin tradition of drinking. The prices are very reasonable ( cocktail 5 to 7 bucks) and if you happen to be here at happy hour you almost get paid to drink."}
{"text":"Recommend this place for folks who visit Madison. Awesome beer selection. The weekly beer special was really tasty and reasonably priced. Enjoyed the Wisconsin burger. It was very crowded, but the wait was not bad."}
{"text":"really good food and drinks, well worth the 30 minute wait.   We were told the wait would be 1.25 hrs but it turned out to be much shorter.  It's loud, had to shout a bit. Sausage appetizer platter was amazing."}
{"text":"First time I came here I had the grilled cheese which is lot memorable. I also had the cheese curds (obviously) which are great with the garlic sauce!!  Second time I had the Mac and cheese with their matchstick fries. The Mac is so so so good!! Would definitely recommend. Wait can be long but they text when your table is ready.  Server was really friendly (:"}
{"text":"We stopped in here while walking around the capitol. It drew a good crowd on a Wednesday evening; we probably waited half an hour to get seated. I had the lake perch and it was delicious.   The menu has a good variety, and they have a huge selection of beers. I would definitely recommend it if you happened to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is popular. You will be waiting! That being said, I'm a college student from California and here's what I think:  Interior/Ambiance: Dim, but not too dim. Very inviting, yet busy...you'll be needing to speak up.  The food: There's something for everyone, and it's ALL great, and it is ALL very reasonably priced. Full-sized burger and shoestring onion fries for $10. What more could you want? Don't let the price fool you--the food is of EXCELLENT quality.  Service: I've learned that everyone in Wisconsin is super nice, and these servers are no different. Yes, they'll be busy, but once you get their attention, they're very concerned and helpful and pleasant.  BOTTOM LINE: Come here. Just come here."}
{"text":"While the food at the old fashioned always tastes great, the service is always so poor. There have been multiple ocassions where my party could not get a waitress, drinks, or even the bill. Last night I brought a party of 6 and was seated and brought out waters by the host but after 15 minutes and no server we took our money and went elsewhere. On a separate night with the same party we ordered a pitcher of beer only to see our waitress had pulled up a seat at the bar! Realizing she had checked out for the night a member of our table ordered our pitcher directly at the bar, 20 minutes and half a pitcher later guess who comes to our table with our pitcher? unbelievable.  Yes they have great food and a wide selection of beers which is why I keep coming back but I would love to leave the old fashioned feeling like we had great service as well."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on their brunch.  The food that came out seemed to be prepared well enough so as far as taste goes I have no complaints but I felt that the brunch menu itself was very limited especially in vegetarian options.  And it's just my personal opinion that an egg scramble is simply the lazy man's omelet but I can't really fault them for that as the egg was tasty enough.  The food was prepared very fast though and the general atmosphere seemed okay for the type of place that seems to be typical student fare.  I won't return for brunch but I'll try the dinner menu some time soon to see how that holds up."}
{"text":"Best Cheese Curds on the planet.  Meals are good as well.  Solid place all around (quality, portions, price, atmosphere, etc).  Very good."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already said about The Old Fashioned? Probably nothing.   This might be Madison's most popular restaurant. I'm genuinely surprised when it's not full and people don't seem to have a problem waiting an hour to get in.    Pros: -Top notch service  -Sets the standards for Madison's bar food scene  -Excellent atmosphere that's the right balance of kitsch and class   Cons: -Man, this place is always busy. Expect a wait for a table."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is far from its name. It's full of energy and in the midst of a college town in Michigan. They offer great mixed drinks at a decent price and their food is fantastic. The one item I will suggest, no matter what your pallet, is the cheese curds. They are one of the best appetizers I've had in any restaurant and come with a multitude of sauces for dipping (provided you pay a little extra for each). Well worth it."}
{"text":"The was a nice casual restaurant near the Capitol. It was busy when we got there, but they gave us discounted drink tickets, and what's not to like about that. Plus, our wait was only like 10-15 min, which wasn't bad at all. The place is noisy, not because there is blaring music, it must just be the acoustics of the building and all of the people. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The food was delicious. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The burger with the egg, which I believe is number #30 is amazing! I always say if your burger/sandwich isn't messy, it isn't good. And this one drips down your hands and forearms with deliciousness. I've never gotten anything else at the Old Fashioned, and while I'm sure everything is good, I have no plans to try anything else."}
{"text":"My go-to is the wedge salad with blue cheese and door county cherries. Love the Apple Jack old fashioned and you can't go wrong with a little bit of their famous small batch Cherry Bounce during the winter.  TIP: Tiger sauce with the cheese curds"}
{"text":"The cheese curds are hyped up. It's a solid place, and their mac n cheese is a good option. The cheese curds were solid but again hyped up. I felt like I had them before... and finally remembered, this tastes like T.G.I. Friday's mozzarella sticks that you get frozen from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Solid heavy handed pours and an awesome selection of cocktails.   They muddle hard...and I respect that!"}
{"text":"This a top-ten restaurant in Madison, which has more restaurants than is reasonable for a town its size. Great for brunch on weekends - their scrambles use local ingredients and are always tasty with excellent rosemary potatoes. Excellent bloody marys as well. It's very Wisconsin - Wisconsin beers that are reasonably priced, pickled meats and veggies, and cheese boards. The cheese curds are to die for."}
{"text":"Place was absolutely packed but they got us in very quickly considering. Ending up ordering the Wisconsin burger, one of the best burgers I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I come to Madison a few times a year, and I always find time to stop by this place, which I think is one of the best bars in America.  Start with the ridiculous beer list, which has about 50 brews on tap and all of them are from the state of Wisconsin. It's epic.  The food is also excellent. I've had the cheese plate, the sausage plate, a burger with onion straws and cheese curds, and they've all been terrific.  Love the atmosphere in here. It's far enough away from the campus hangouts to attract a more adult crowd. It's casual but not too casual. There are a couple of TVs but it's a place you can have a conversation. And there's a great view of the Capitol right across the street.  Service has always been top notch. Love this place and how it always makes me feel like I'm in Wisconsin. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great Wisconsin choices. If you are looking for a down-to-earth, comfort food meal, look no further! Bar staff was amazing as well. Good people and very kind."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and only had these things: beer, cheese curds, and fish & chips.  That being said, I am a fan.  Though I am almost always a fan of these things.  The shining star for me is the cheese curds.  Though, cheese always shines for me.  I love you, cheese.  Don't ever leave me.  Our party of 10 ordered 1 basket, then 2 baskets - and they were gone in the blink of an eye.  I'm salivating a bit just thinking about them.  Service is good, except they won't split your checks.  So keep that in mind as you overpay for your dinner because someone at your table is being cheap - or worse, left without paying.  Ugh.  They have karaoke on Wednesdays, with an impressive collection for a traveling act.  Karaoke for me gets old after a couple hours, but it was fun while it lasted."}
{"text":"Food was ok, I was expecting more in terms of taste, fish I ordered a bit smelly, the drinks were great, price was great, very reasonable"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, deserves 5 stars!!  I had the corn beef and hash.  This was amazing!  My husband had a omelet and it was also delicious!  We started with the fresh made donuts with powered sugar.  I could have eaten 3 plates of these.  Server was great as well.  We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Long wait but the food was very good.  Cheese curds were wonderful.  They ran out of hot dogs which was surprising."}
{"text":"Good solid Wisconsin food and popular watering hole. The cheese curds are a staple for anyone's first time."}
{"text":"Out of towners from Florida here (but originally from Wi). Came for dinner, but were also hoping to have an interesting beer. This place has 52 draft choices, and all crafts from Wi!! Had a few while waiting for our meal.  I had the No. 30 which is a burger with sautéed onions and a fried egg on it. By far the best burger I've had! I could have licked the plate!   I am now hoping my son chooses UWM so I can come back here more often!"}
{"text":"So overrated. It's very sad to hear people recommend this place to out-of-town guests because it's representative \"Wisconsin food\" or something. Greasy, mediocre food is NOT doing a great job representing Wisconsin. There are many wonderful restaurants just a block (or less!) away that do much better justice to Wisconsin with fresh, local, innovating cuisine... why would you waste your time on a regular greasy cheeseburger or just-okay fried cheese curds.  If you're going to go, go for the Wednesday night karaoke and two-for-one, not for dinner. If you're looking for food, please do yourself a favor and walk in either direction."}
{"text":"I am delighted that two years later I love this place. Great atmosphere and  yummy food. We went on a Tuesday night and the $1.50 tacos were surprisingly yummy. Not to mention the mac n cheese is pretty incredible. Everyone including the kids were thrilled with their dinners. Definitely a great place for after work drinks, dinner with friends or the whole family. A Madison must!"}
{"text":"The good, atmosphere, menu & service was great.  I had the fried cheese curds, which were excellent.  Next visit I'll try some brats or a Wisconsin cheese plate."}
{"text":"This was such a cool treat!  There was a 45 minute wait on Saturday morning, but we grabbed 2 seats at the bar from brunch.  Short version- food was great, bar tender was a trip, and price was really reasonable!  Great experience !  I have the chicken fried steak and my wife had a cheeseburger while we shared cheese curds. Both were were memory makers!  Homemade goodness but it's very best.  Our bartender was an absolute hoot - he was like Nick Swardson - but still trying to figure out being funny - more organic.   He kept singing hall and Oates songs.   After our meal we grabbed a bar side, locally sourced beef stick that was somewhere between indescribable, and indescribably good.  Nothing I can say will give it the due it deserves... The only thing that would've made it better would be if I were totally hung over when I ate it and I eat it for three days a little bit at a time because it was so rich.    We will be back and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom!  I love the lazy suzans and the burgers here.  The walleye sandwich was also good, but oh, my, the lazy suzans are fun!  We also like the vodka variety.  Be prepared, though, this place always seems to be packed, and for good reason."}
{"text":"I've been to the Old Fashioned quite a few times since it opened in 2005 and I've never come away disappointed.  I especially enjoy how the restaurant has improved on the traditional Wisconsin fare that is found in supper clubs throughout the state.  I enjoy the classic supper clubs as much as the next guy, but in my opinion the Old Fashioned exceeds these establishments by using higher quality local ingredients and a fresh dose of experimentation.  Now it should be stressed that the Old Fashioned is NOT a supper club.  I've gone there with friends that were under this impression, and it lessened their opinions of the place because they were expecting the usual prime rib specials and relish tray.  No, this is a downtown restaurant and bar on the Square, with food that combines the traditional with modern flavors.  The food at the Old Fashioned is the main reason I never hesitate in coming back.  I'm especially fond of the roast beef tenderloin sandwich (#42) - maybe my favorite roast beef sandwich of all time.  The turkey breast and the pulled pork are also perfectly balanced sandwiches, and the chicken (#37 - sans the mayo) is another stand-by.  I haven't screwed up the courage to order the summer sausage sandwich quite yet, but every time I inch a bit closer to doing so.  The Old Fashioned Burger, with fried onions, bacon, cheddar and an egg, has always looked to be too much for me, but my friend ordered it last night and he indicated that I should not miss the opportunity in the future.  The side salads that come with the sandwiches are very good, but I have a hard time passing up the fries, which are perfectly salted and crispy.  I would also suggest trying one of the cheese platters before a meal, especially if someone else is buying.  The bar is well-stocked and there is an excellent tap selection of local brews.  There always seems to be running specials (last night was pitchers of Tyranena Honey Blonde for $9).  I have not tried the signature cocktail, however.  I'm not partial to brandy, but my mother, an aficienado of the brandy old fashioned sweet if there ever was one, enjoyed hers, though she was quick to point out that the drink at \"her\" bar will always be the undisputed king.  The only drawbacks to the place are that it can get loud and that it is seemingly always busy.  Fortunately you can order from the bar instead of wait for a table, and the meals tend to come quickly when you're at the bar, which helps speed things along if you're in a hurry.  The entree prices are a bit on the high side but balance out with the drink specials, so overall the place is a pretty good value for downtown."}
{"text":"The last time I was in Madison I ate here twice in one day.  That, I believe, is a testament to my faith in and adoration for this establishment.    The burgers are reliably first rate and the paprika sauce is so good that I would bathe it in.  It would probably have good effects on the skin anyway.  The drink specials are usually pretty great too - each month they  feature a local-ish brew which they sell for cheap and the \"double bubble\" special on some weeknights from 10:30pm to midnight allows you to get  2 for 1 taps and rail mixers.    This restaurant encapsulates my profound love for Wisconsin."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place and with some of the best drink prices for a nicer place I have seen.   Get aged cheese curds...they're worth the price. Enjoy more than one old fashioned brandy (sweet) as you cannot drink enough of these while in Madison. Brandy old fashioned has completely raised the bar on how good a cocktail can taste."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal today. My wife and I shared the Lazy Susan platter and the Sausage platter. Great samples of German sausages, fish, pickles, cheese spreads, liver sausage, deviled eggs, sour kraut, pickled green beans and breads. We both had old fashions which were also good. A must go place."}
{"text":"Be patient at lunch time, excellent food, great drinks, craft beer, convenient location."}
{"text":"We love the Old Fashioned for Sunday brunch, lunch, cocktails or dinner. Do I have everything covered? Friday fish fry is great. Cheese curds and rings are terrific. Brats are vintage Cheboygan. If I am in the mood for brats I usually get the double.  If there is one restaurant/bar in the Madison area that will provide the true Madison experience this is the place. As an added bonus It's also right across the street from our beautiful state capital and, from April to October, the capital square hosts a world class Farmer's Market on Saturdays from sunrise until early afternoon. If there's a long wait for a table try to grab a spot at the bar for your meal. Bar service is top notch!  One more thing...DON'T leave without trying an Old Fashioned. You will order a second! I prefer mine with Maker's Mark and sour! Simply Awesome!"}
{"text":"Super location across from the Capitol building with lots of people walking about. I went on a Saturday for lunch at 12:30 and the place was packed. We put our names in for a 30-minute wait but found two seats at the bar right away. We took those instead and I'm really glad we did because Nick, our bartender was a good guy to have serving us.  I ordered the Old Fashioned to help get rid of my cough (HONEST!) and my friend ordered the House Brew which is a dark, rich and flavorful beer, kind of dunkel-y, maybe?. Anyway, both were delicious but I wish I would have ordered the bourbon old fashioned instead of the Korbel. The brandy was OK .. I just missed the bourbon taste.  Since The Old Fashioned prides itself on providing the Wisconsin experience, we ordered the house-made cheese curds to start. Holy heart attack, those suckers were good, cheese oozing out of a lite batter, with some ranch on the side. I imagine they sell a boatload of those things late at night when folks have reached a certain level of intoxication. Continuing with the Wisconsin theme, I got the #32 brat with some potato salad and pretty much devoured it. I got a nice grilled brat with some raw onion and pickles with mustard on a bun. Great flavor, snap from the brat and mustard, and texture from the raw onion and pickles. The potato salad was creamy and slightly dilly .. a good choice for the well-seasoned brat. My companion ordered the summer sausage w/muenster on rye and really enjoyed it. He got the onion straws and they were super crispy and sweet, the perfect compliment to the summer sausage. He said he wished he would have ordered the sauerkraut with his sandwich but the mustard provided a little kick and I liked it just the way that it was. After the curds, the main course and another old fashioned, I had no room for dessert. But my cough was better, so there's that.  There's a lot to love about The Old Fashioned, most of it because they're everything they claim to be. With it's location alone, it could easily have gone the touristy route but I found it to be completely authentic. I love that they stick to the Wisconsin roots and that a fair amount of food is locally sourced, which is important to me. Their beer selection is phenomenal and despite being super busy, our service was friendly and fast. Looking back, I almost wish it would have been delayed because there's a lot to take in at that place and since I was only there on a day trip from Iowa, I wanted to savor the experience.  The good news is that it's only a couple hours away and I can easily come back!"}
{"text":"I had to try deep fried cheese curds...it was my first visit to Madison, after all. I asked for the best in town and went where I was told.  Parking was not easy ...but that's a Madison thing...and the cheese curds were even more awesome than I'd expected. Like mac 'n cheese without the mac.  Yummy enough to join the Badger brats n' curds bandwagon."}
{"text":"You gotta try the crispy onion strands, they are the best! Such an extensive beer menu,, only problem with it is that it only has Wisconsin beers, would be nice if it included some micro brews from our neighboring states. Love the layout of the space. If your only in town for a few days this is a great place to experience Wisconsin on your table. Karakee night is a little loud, but I just dont enjoy karaokee in the first place so that would be a hard sell for me."}
{"text":"New favorite: #35 Veggie sandwich  So I know I said the meats here are great - AND they are! But for summertime, this veggie sandwich is amazing. Yes it has the typical boring veggies: portabella mushroom, red pepper and zucchini, but where it really shines is the perfectly grilled eggplant (texture is similar to the portabella and intakes surrounding flavors when done correct), goat cheese and BLACK OLIVE tapenade. These last 3 flavors combine perfectly. It's not a simple pesto item, it's more thoughtful. I can't have the cheese (my partner swears by it), but that olive tapenade  - I mean, I could just eat that on bread and be perfectly happy. The veggies add filling.   I still love: Old Fashioneds Huge tap menu #37 chicken breast with bacon, mustard/mayo French fries Pickled egg Eggs Benedict - veggie or ham, with/out hollandaise sauce"}
{"text":"Love their cheese curds!   This place is the definition of Wisconsin food."}
{"text":"Food is superb to say the least. I went there based on past reviews. The place was packed and the aroma was enticing. I had the Sunday chicken special since the bartender recommended it. It was one of the best chicken I've eaten. I went to work bragging on the great food and staff."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and great Old Fashioned and Bloody Mary.  Grilled Summer Sausage was great, cheeseburger with egg was very good.  Cheese curds are worth the extra $3.00 cost as a side.  Only one our party needed to upgrade to the curds in order to share"}
{"text":"Exactly what I wanted on my trip to Madison. Fried cheesy goodness on a plate, great beers, and friendly service. An enjoyable experience in every way."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with some colleagues.  It was a pretty decent lunch.  I had a battered walleye sandwich.  The fish and batter were excellent.  I really enjoyed the lightness of the fish with just the right seasonings and crunch.  The accompanying sauce was about average, a good compliment to the fish.  The bread used was nice, but I think it was a bit too buttered in the toasting process.  It made it a bit too greasy.   I was impressed with their beer selection and would be interested in going back some day to try a few more."}
{"text":"Had a really great time at The Old Fashioned while passing through town. The wait for a party of 3 was about 45 minutes on a Monday, but they have an excellent system that texts you when your table is ready, and have two full bars you can order from while you wait.   There are 50 different Wisconsin-brewed beers on tap to choose from, as well as many more in bottles. Even though it was busy, the bartender was very attentive and had great beer suggestions.   When it came time to sit down, we ordered a pitcher of a regionally-brewed Mexican style beer  (on special for $11!), a plate of fried cheese curds with a horseradish dipping sauce, and the wurst plate - three different sausages made with Wisconsin beer, served with two delicious mustards, sauerkraut, pickled green beans, and fresh-out-of-the-oven dark bread. The curds were tasty as expected, but the sausages, bread and mustards stole the show. Each sausage was perfectly cooked and well complimented by the sauerkraut and pickled beans.   For entrees, we all ordered burgers. The Monday special was two classic cheeseburgers - Wisconsin cheddar, onions, mayo, pickle, and lettuce - for $8.95. Two of us did that, and our third party ordered the spicy burger with jalapeno cheese. The burgers were flavorful and juicy (cooked medium to medium-rare) and the cheese is not to be beat.   Our whole bill, excluding the beers while waiting for our table, was just under $55. On the value scale, The Old Fashioned ranks near the top. I'll be back my next time through Wisconsin."}
{"text":"If you go for nothing else then go and try their delicious and reasonably priced cocktails. I personally had their Brandy Old Fashioned and their Manhattan. Their old fashioned was one of the best I've had, and while I wasn't a huge fan of the Manhattan, I think that has more to do with my personal tastes for bourbon.  Then since you're already there, you may as well go ahead and eat since the food is all delicious, especially the burgers."}
{"text":"Burger and cheese curds? Yes please! This is a higher end place where you'll get a juicy burger and fried cheese curds with a melty inside but not overly greasy.   Order takeout for lunch (they get really busy so call ahead) then go find a place to sit on the capital lawn or bench and listen to the musical performances as you enjoy your food!"}
{"text":"Was visiting for work last week with two coworkers. We had to try this place since it had 4 stars and so many reviews. We had the cheese curds of course which were amazing and the beer cheese soup which was also tasty. For our entrees we had the rib sandwich, the burger, and the chicken and swiss sandwich. The sandwiches were just ok but I liked that they came with the choice of mixed greens. The fries were also good. Everything was very reasonably priced and the service was great."}
{"text":"Great cheese curds, we enjoyed the paprika dip on them. The perch was good, it had a very nice breading, not too heavy like so many places.   The location is fun. We went on a Friday evening, so it was about an hour and 15 minute wait, but we were able to get drinks at the bar while we waited."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place - but decided it came out to yelp's A-OK.  We ordered the No. 30 (burger with egg) with cheese curds and the No. 36 (beer battered wall-eye sandwich).  The burger was a bit overcooked.  The cheese curds were too oily for me.  We noticed that the guys sitting beside us barely touched their cheese curds, and I'm guessing that may have been the reason.  Every time you take a bite, your mouth fills with oil.  I'm such a cheese lover, so you can imagine how disappointed I was.  My favorite part of the meal was my fish sandwich - although I think using a softer bread for contrast would have worked better than the crunchy toast they used.  Flavors were good, maybe they were off on the cheese curds that day (needed to drain the oil longer?)...unfortunately, I won't have the chance to return (out of towner) to give them another chance."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is the quintessential Madison restaurant. An enormous beer selection (props to the abundance of hard to find microbrews on tap) and the cheeeeese!! The cheese curds are heaven!! And although I've yet to personally try it, I've heard from two fellow restaurant-goers that the walleye sandwich is \"The best fish sandwich they have EVER tasted.\"   Aside from the excellent food, the old Schlitz memorabilia and general nostalgic Wisconsin decor make for a memorable visit. I agree with many of the other reviewers- this is definitely THE restaurant to take someone who is visiting from out of town. It truly highlights the best things about Wisconsin. And by best things, I mean beer and cheese of course!"}
{"text":"We were descending in the hotel elevator with the hotel chef. My hubby asked him where he likes to eat and he told us to go to The Old Fashioned! We've been here several times since, whenever we're in Madison, and we like it every time. It's lively, crowded, noisy. Yes, you will wait for a table or spot at the bar, and yes, you will order an Old Fashioned and be delighted. There's many permutations of this drink here, so try a couple. The food is not the biggest draw - I've had the Wisconsin cheese beer soup, cheese plate (now that's a good choice for sure), the prime rib sandwich (good), fish fry. Just don't ignore your neighbor at the bar who says \"Pass on the Green Bay Chili, it's not that good.\" I didn't take her advice and she was right. But it's so great in here, pretty good food is good enough."}
{"text":"Not a bad place at all.  We stopped in for dinner and there was a wait - over 60 minutes.  The wait seemed a bit excessive - especially for a Monday night.  But we were i town for a convention so that may be why.   Before I begin - think of this as a nice college beer joint where you can get good pub food.    We started with the cheese curds - nice but those are some serious belly bombers.    Then we had a veggie platter and that was nice.  I had the burger special and it was cooked exactly to order.    The wait staff was very nice and accommodating.    If we didn't have over an hour wait - add a star."}
{"text":"Very good food, lot of beer selection. Got the old fashioned house burger. Only downside to this place is it can be crowded and loud."}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks and snacks!  I made my own old fashioned and it was delicious. Such a neat idea!  We also tried the cheese plates and spreads.....all super yummy.  This was my first time in Madison and everyone said  I had to go to Old Fashioned....they were right!"}
{"text":"I was between a 3 & 4, but remembered they have the best cheese curds I've ever had. Good fries too. MAC & cheese is usually pretty good. Fish fry's not the best I've had. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Took a little 2 day vacay to the Madison area and The Old Fashioned was our find for lunch.  To say the parking was ridiculous was an understatement, but it was around 12:30 in the afternoon on a weekday...parking around the capital is going to be a disaster on a weekday afternoon.  When we walked in there seemed to be a long line, but it was just a party of 13 that walked in off the street and seemed surprised it would be a 45 minute wait to seat a party of that size with no notice...hint: NEVER show up at a restaurant with a party of that size without calling first!!  Once that group was over there huffiness, we arrived at the hostess stand and were immediately seated.  Our server arrived quickly and informed us of the lunchtime ordering procedure.  It seemed odd to walk up to the bar to order when we were ready; however, seeing the system in action, it made a lot of sense in the end.  We started with the cheese curds (of course!) and were not disappointed.  Now, this isn't an app you want to order a couple times a week, you'd want a cardiologist on call if you did that, but it certainly is a nice treat every once in a while.  I ordered the BLT special with haystack onion rings on the side.  The BLT was delicious...the bread was tasty and grilled on a flat-top to perfection, the tomato was heirloom and sweet and juicy.  Everything you need for a great BLT!  The haystacks were very good, as well.  My GF ordered a burger and fries and said it was very good, as well.  All in all, the service was good, the server was attentive, but not overbearing, and we were in and out in about 45 minutes...which I thought was great considering it was lunch time directly across the street from the capital!  Also, the lunch bill for 2 people with beverages and an app was only $32, can't beat that with a stick!  Looking forward to our next visit to Madison, The Old Fashioned will definitely be on our list!"}
{"text":"I'm only kinda a fan of The Old Fashioned.  The food was delicious.  The drinks were meh.  And the service was snotty.    The food was delicious.  We had the cheese curds because what else do you eat when you're in Wisconsin and we hadn't had any since dinner the night before.  They were very good.  I had a BLT with either fresh mozzarella or burrata (I don't remember which) on it and it was fantastic.  It may have been the highlight of my trip.  Actually, I was so focused on my sandwich I don't even remember what anyone else had.    The service when we sat down was great.  They were there when you wanted something but not annoying.  We did have to wait for about 30 minutes for a table, which isn't a problem when there's a bar to grab a drink at.  The Old Fashioned is definitely a Wisconsin treasure.  I'm pretty sure everyone in Madison was there for dinner that night.  The décor just screams \"WISCONSIN\" which could be a bad thing, but they've done it just right here.   Now, sadly, the service and drinks that mad me think \"meh\"... We showed up around 7 on a Tuesday night and there was a 30 minute wait, so of course we decided to get a drink while we waited.  Being an old fashioned lover I figured I should order one of the namesake drinks.  The bartender who looked about 23 asked if I wanted it sweet or sour or with brandy.  I looked at him like he had two heads.  I said \"An old fashioned please\".  Aaaannnd we repeated the same process.  The other bartender recognized this look of confusion and started to explain that in Wisconsin things are done stupidly, I mean, scratch that, \"differently\".  Bartender #1 said \"Ok, just tell me what you want and I'll make it\"  So I gave him the ingredients for how the rest of the world makes an old fashioned.  Bartender #2 acknowledged that the rest of the world makes them one way; then explained how they make them in Wisconsin is the original recipe, which changed around 1880.  I replied \"I was barely drinking age in 1880 so maybe that's why I've never had one like that\".  He did not find that as humorous as I did.  The drink was how it would be if I made it at home: Meh.  I'm sure we'll be back at The Old Fashioned next time we're in Madison.  I will not be ordering an Old Fashioned though.  Maybe I'll try the Spotted Cow..."}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER AGAIN EAT HERE SOBER!!! I'm a vegetarian, so I can't say much about the burgers.  I can, however, vouch for the fact that the grilled cheese and roasted veggie sandwiches were the most tasteless, greasy things I've eaten in a loooong time.  The dressing that comes on the side salad contains bacon, which is something people should be made aware of.  Even the cheese curds were nasty.  I'm not sure if they ran out of their usual curds, cuz the ones I had at Taste of Madison were delicious.  The curds I ate last time were flavorless and greasier than cheese curds should be.  In addition, the ceiling is so high and the place is so warehouse-like that decent, sober conversation is nearly impossible.   I might head back to The Old Fashioned for drinks sometime, but I certainly won't be the person suggesting it!"}
{"text":"We stopped into Madison for the evening.  We were looking for some local fare. The hotel desk clerk recommended The Old Fashioned.  It was a short drive to the capital building.  It was Sunday night, I was amazed that the place was packed.  That had to be a good sign.  We had the following the Old Fashioned burger, fried cheese curds, the Wurst platter and two kids meals.  The burger was likely the best burger I have had in my life.  Absolutely incredible.  The cheese curds are battered in house, not frozen.  They were incredible.  We have a German exchange student with us, he has been sampling sausage all over the Midwest hoping to find something as good as home.  The Sausage on the platter was \"exactly like home\" however the sour kraut was not to his liking.  We also had the beer cheese soup.  It was more beer than soup, it was good but not what I expect from a cheese soup.   This trip was great"}
{"text":"I am so glad we decided to wait for a table during busy lunchtime. They said 45 minutes, but it was more like 25.  The tables are a little close together, so not much privacy. Their kids menu is actual food, my kids loved the Wisconsin beef hotdogs. My slow roast pork sandwich was FANTASTIC.  My husbands green salad with chicken was generous and not over dressed.  The beer selection is overwhelming, but our server provided some great suggestions. The service was quick and accommodated our kids (brought their food first, asked what kind of cups to bring).  Waiter Ben V. was great."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on our last night in Madison. I really like the atmosphere at this restaurant. The vibe here is great and I really got a feel of the Wisconsin culture and vibe here. It has a casual, friendly, laid-back and generous ambiance - much like the Wisconsin people that I have encountered on my first trip to the state.  My husband tried the bourbon old-fashioned, just to get a taste, but ended up ordering 3 of those because it was so good. Needless to say, I was the one who had to drive us back to the hotel after stuffing ourselves with the brats and chili and beer cheese soup (which I've never heard of before). It was delicious, but not so good for the arteries.  But eh, you only live once. I heart Madison."}
{"text":"Day 506: Wisconsin Road Trip Part 5: The Old Fashioned: We rolled into Madison around 5pm and, after checking into the AirBnB, walked downtown to The Old Fashioned, an eatery that was recommended by just about every Madisonian on Facebook. This is possibly because it appears to be one of the few things after 5pm on a Madison weekday. (I'm going to blame Walker for that, since he seems like the kind of guy who races home to watch an hour of CBS before turning it at nine.)  Anyways, The Old Fashioned was great. I started off with a Wisconsin Beer Bomb, which was a goblet of Pabst Blue Ribbon with a pickled egg in it. I don't know if the flavors just meshed well together or if locally-sourcing your PBR makes a big difference, but it was probably the best glass of it I've ever had. And also the only pickled egg I've ever had.   From then on, there was a titular Old Fashioned (the \"Northern Exposure\" variation), a plate of cheese curds with smoked paprika dipping sauce, and the No. 30 Old Fashioned House Burger, topped with fried onions, bacon, cheddar, garlic sauce and a soft-cooked egg. It was all delicious, but definitely made me regret not driving there. There's deciding to walk to a place, and then there's deciding to walk home after having consumed your weight in fried cheddar. Highly recommended, but dear god, don't try to be a hero."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned's reputation stands strong, a testament to the glory of hearty Wisconsin eats. Do yourself a favor and order the famous curds with smoked paprika sauce as a starter.   I've ordered the Green Bay style chili before - piled high on top of noodles. Flavor is okay, but it's basically spaghetti.   I would recommend going for a burger (veg options too)! Last time I was here I ordered the spicy burger, which has quite the kick with jalapeños and pepper jack. Choice of greens or French fries as a side.   Just know coming into this place that there's likely a wait. They don't take reservations!! But it's worth it, it always is."}
{"text":"Cheese curds were very good, extremely friendly bartender. Also got the pork shoulder and it was delicious."}
{"text":"If you love beer, you've got to come here. This is especially true if you're not living in WI and want to try some delicious WI-made brews. They had 52 of them on tap when I was here, many form breweries I haven't heard of (and I try to stay on top of such things from my home state). They also had many in bottles, including bombers. And the prices are crazy cheap for such awesome beer. My brother and I were there on a Thursday night and they were doing 2-for-1 pints of anything...anything! Plus you can do tasting flights in case you feel like a kid in a candy store (that would be me).  Want to see what WI has to offer in the form of craft beer, and hang out in a cool dark wood tavern? The Old Fashioned is your place. Plus, how can you not go to a place with the name \"The Old Fashioned\"? I rest my case."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds in the country. Hands down. I wouldn't go anywhere other than the Old Fashioned to get a taste of Wisconsin. I always bring my out-of-state friends here to fill them up on cheese curds and put a good Wisconsin beer in their hands."}
{"text":"I am really middle of the road on this place. We waited an hour which is expected at 6pm on a Saturday. My take on this place it i s a throwback to a generation of let's fry everything. Very noisy very hectic atmosphere. Which is great if your out with the boys but not a dinner with the wife.  I ordered a medium ribeye and fries. The wife really wanted a burger so she had one also. My steak was cooked perfectly and so was her burger. We both spoke about it and split our meals and decided that the meat seasoning is very heavy handed. Also a very very intense grilled flavor that makes it so you can't taste the beef. Otherwise overall the food was good. The atmosphere was not my cup of tea. So I will try it again someday."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more than I did. I love that is it like a classic WI supper club- complete with pickled eggs and pork hocks. We sat at the bar, and although the service was friendly, I felt it was really slow- it took a very long time for them to initially acknowledge us or for us to receive our food or be checked on, but at least they nice!  They do beer flights for $1/beer sample in increments of 4, 8, or 12- what a good deal! And you can choose any of their over 40 beers on tap. Of course we ordered the cheese curds, which were greasy and delicious. Otherwise I was kind of disappointed in the food. I ordered the Wurst platter, two of my sausages were under cooked, and they all were just overall bland. My boyfriend ordered the chili cheese dog- the hot dog was very good, but the chili was the worst chili I have ever had- literally no seasoning at all (and I have very low chili standards) There was also barely any cheese on it at all. I think that maybe they were just having an off day, or we just ordered the wrong items of the menu, but based off their food alone I would not come back.   A great place to try some WI beers and cheese curds, but maybe go elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places in Madison!  I love coming here for breakfast or brunch.  Their brunch menu is delicious and surprisingly affordable.  They serve a great old fashioned (obviously) but my favorite is definitely the Wisconsin bloody mary."}
{"text":"This place is a tourist trap, be warned. Everyone tells you have to go here so you go. You can expect to be given a 1-3 hour wait time no matter when you go, even if you go solo. So, this is where the fun comes in-- hang out at the bar for a bit and drink! It's a fun bar scene with very little seating, so standing is to be expected. They have tons of great brews on tap for a decent pint price. This place is always packed, so standing in a tiny bar with people all around you can feel stressful, especially when the kitchen is on the other side so the servers are forced to wade through a crowded bar area with trays of food constantly. That being said, we had fun drinking here.  Once we finally sat, we all got cheese curds and BBQ plates with our beers. The food is 100% average, exactly what one would expect at a tourist destination. I would never return here for food. I feel like once you experience this place, there's no reason to ever return really.  The BBQ was generic. Nothing to write home about. The cheese curds were good not great. This place is hugely overrated and probably not worth the wait honestly, but if you need to experience it because people talked it up as THE place to try, don't go into it with high expectations."}
{"text":"Best fried curds I've had in my few trips to Madison, and the burgers are SOLID.  I had he Spicy Burger - a tasty patty with jalapeños, Jack cheese, and bacon - but wanted to try the House burger (with cheddar and fried egg) that my friends got as well.  Next time."}
{"text":"Good food with giant portions and reasonable prices Can't really match their cheese curds anywhere in Madison. The only thing that makes this a 4 star place is the ridiculous waiting time. They don't take reservations and their hosts aren't really the best at managing available table."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a great place for food. I love the cheese curds. I ordered the Walleye sandwich which was good. My friend ordered the Prime Rib sandwich. It was blasé. Could've been better. They make a good Old Fashioned. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Don't need to say too much, let the reviews of the other restaurants speak for themselves. This place is as good as it gets in Madison. The did get rid of the apple pie with sharp cheddar, which I was VERY dissapointed in... But, plenty of other amazing options."}
{"text":"So, the other reviews were right when they said you weren't going to get seated right away. The hostess took our names down and said the wait would be 30-45 minutes long...yet...we looked around and saw there were many empty tables.  Before I started to take it personally, my sister and I asked a couple near the bar to see if this was a common thing. They were actually waiting for literally, 50 minutes before they were called to their table (in the middle of our conversation). Apparently, they tell everyone it's a 30-45 minute wait no matter if it's more or less.   We actually got seated about 15-20 minutes after we arrived and we also got a free sampling of the local beers thanks to the awesome bartender who took the time to explain his favorite beers from around the area.   We got to our table and ordered the Wisconsin burger (their beef is grass fed locally apparently) and also ordered the mac & cheese (you got to...it's Wisconsin!). The food came out in excellent time and the burgers were DELICIOUS! Nice, melt-in-your-mouth burgers. They weren't overwhelmingly greasy...just juicy. Yum. And the mac & cheese, to die for. I forgot what kind of cheese combo they had but it was light and heavenly. This place is definitely a fave in downtown Madison! Also, the price is amazing for all the food you get.  Also, as far as atmosphere, the capitol building is literally across the street...great scenery!"}
{"text":"I no longer live in Wisconsin, but when I visited recently I made sure to visit The Old Fashioned to enjoy classic Wisconsin fare. The cheese curds here are probably some of the best in the city. I absolutely love them! For my meal I had a salmon salad, which was also absolutely delicious. They have plenty of other great menu items that source from local farmers and businesses.  Additionally, the vibe and location are great. Located on the Capital Square The Old Fashioned is situated right in the heart of Madison. The restaurant is cozy and inviting with lots of Wisconsin decor and plenty of that Midwest niceness!"}
{"text":"UM SERIOUSLY THE BEST FOOD IVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE. my mind was literally blown.   (also, we went next door while waiting and had HUGE martinis at Harvest .so like my dining partner and I had the drunk munchies by the time the food arrived. take that into account.)   Anyway, the food is INCREDIBLE. not healthy. but it's delicious wisconsin fare made by someone who knows what s/he's doing.  we had an appetizer of cheese curds in spanish parika sauce. SO GOOD. then. i had the friday night fish fry. holy crap!!!! so good. also my dining partner had a hamburger with an egg on it. most delicious hamburger on earth. extremely delicious meat in the hamburger.  oh also, everything in wisconsin is basically free. we had two entrees, two beers, and an appetizer. the bill was THIRTY SIX DOLLARS  how is that even POSSIBLE. it was like being in heaven.   there was about a 20 minute wait and the place was REALLY crowded due to a favorable review in the paper the previous Sunday.   but srsly, it was worth it. it was like the best meal in recent memory."}
{"text":"Was up in Madison apartment searching and went to the old fashioned with my family. Great food and beer selections. The cheese trays are also a must try. The only real bummer about this place is that you can't call ahead for a reservation. However, if you're 21 you can go to the bar and try some of the wide variety of beers they have on tap."}
{"text":"I didn't try much of the other food here other than the fish fry as well as cocktails, but I had quite a good experience here.  I started off with the fried cheese curds which were excellent, not too greasy, yet with a delightfully crisp batter. Probably the best fried cheese curds that I've had yet in Madison. I had the lake perch fish fry when I was here, their Friday special. The fish was delicate in flavor and texture with a nice light batter. A bit pricey as compared to other fish fries, but the quality of the fish was excellent.  In terms of cocktails, they make an excellent Wisconsin-style old fashioned. Well balanced in terms of brandy to mixer to muddled fruit, this drink is supurb. I would highly recommend the applejack old fashioned. They also have a wonderful seasonal cocktail menu with specials such as the brandy slush, a very \"girlie\" sweet and alcoholic slushie as well as last year's spiced-pear-tini featuring Hangar One spiced pear vodka, fresh lemon juice, and fresh cider. I recently went and had their \"Purple People Eater\" that was composed of house infused Concord grape vodka and lemonade. This cocktail truly brings you back to your childhood days of sipping on a box of ice cold concord grape juice... simply delightful. The in-house mixologist at this restaurant truly knows what he's doing.   If you're around the capitol building and especially would like to try out some exquisitely crafted cocktails, The Old Fashioned is a great stop."}
{"text":"Drinking a Brandy old-fashioned at the Old Fashioned? Check that off the bucket list!    Living outside of Wisconsin for almost a decade, in a state devoid of Friday fish frys, this restaurant sure brings back the nostalgia of 'Sconnie.  Even though it wasn't Friday, I ordered a Friday Fish Fry-ish meal- the fried walleye sandwich, and it was fabulous. I knocked it back with 7oz Rhinelander shorties (only $1) because its all about looking cool.  If you don't come for the food or drink come to stare at all the shit on the walls.  They had a plethora of Blatz, Schlitz, Hamm's and Pabst collectibles on the walls.  There was one, either Schlitz or Blatz that had a Hispanic dude on it saying \"Te Gusta...\" - I tried to take a picture (it didn't take due to the glare), but its gotta be one of the earliest examples of an ethnic pandering advertisement from a Wisconsin brewery.  Bonus: they sell postcards for $1, with postage included.  Buy them and send them to your friends, after all the post office could use the money."}
{"text":"Go to the Old Fashioned, have an Old Fashioned your way, some cheese curds with the Tiger Blue dip, and the walleye sandwich. You'll be happy. Can be super busy and they don't take reservations, but you can stop in to put your name on the list and they'll call you when your table is up. Or you jam in behind the bar and sip something while you wait."}
{"text":"We stopped here after the Badger homecoming game and the place was packed. We had a couple of their signature Old Fashioneds, (deliscious!) but unfortunately could not wait for a table due to some other plans. We came back the next day for brunch and were not dissappointed. The Tenderloin Benedict was wonderful! My husband enjoyed the Trout and Eggs. Very fun, very good, very Wisconsin restaurant."}
{"text":"The wait was only 45 minutes for lunch and they had a nice texting system where we could go anywhere while we waited and we would just get a text when our table was ready. They gave us an excellent table with a view of the capitol and service was friendly, although the waitress seemed a bit frazzled because it was the \"farmer's market\" lunch rush on a summer Saturday afternoon. We definitely did not feel rushed while eating, though, and we all had satisfying and relaxing meals.   The cheese curds totally lived up to the hype. Some of the best I've ever had. They also had a great special on New Glarus Totally Naked. Only $2.50/pint! The mac n cheese looked good, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the flavor, which is why this isn't a 5 star review."}
{"text":"I love the Old Fashioned. Located right on the capitol square it is perfect for lunch for the downtown workers. It is also great brunch spot after attending the Farmer's Market. The bloody mary's are a must for brunch! I love sitting at the bar because it is so long and has several HD Flat screens and lots of different types of liquor and trinkets on the wall. My Old Fashion Favorites: Cheese Curds with Tiger sauce (yum!) and The Old Fashion burger (1/4 beef, cheddar, bacon, onion, fried egg) with fries!"}
{"text":"Went here on thursday to show out of towners what a real cheese curd is. Food wise, obviously not disappointed. One of the best in Madison!!  However.  The out of towners are older, and the matron of the group has bad knees and hips. We were obviously dropped off while the \"boys\" parked the car. We go in the restaurant and I remember that they typically don't seat unless the whole party has arrived, but at 5pm on thursday their restaurant was empty with over 2/3 of their tables up front empty. The hostess asked us how many, and told us business policy wouldn't seat us until the whole party arrives. To which I responded, so you're whole restaurant is empty and you can't giver her a seat? She responded no. I took the seat from the table next to the greeters station and told my party member to sit down and rest. The chair was pulled out from the table and flipped \"backwards.\" The hostess said nothing. She told us there was two barstools at the bar, and my guest told her she can't physically sit in a barstool... IE requiring medical accommodation. We asked to speak to a manager who came out at once. I explained and he responded three times that it was company policy to not seat, but then had the audacity to say that it \"looks like someone was able to take care of us\" and indicated the chair she was using. I snapped back that that chair was NOT from an employee, I pulled it out for her on my own. He \"made an exception\" for us, and seated us in the right corner booth of their front room ( there were three tables all by the window being used). He had to wipe the table off to seat us, and proceeded to explain twice more that this isn't company policy.  We would have left if we weren't waiting for our group. We had planned on 4 adults sharing at least two appetizers, ordering most likely double rounds of drinks, and 4 entrees. Instead, we ordered the cheese curds, and the home chips and drank water. We left, and I doubt we'll be back. I have gone there on packed friday nights, so I recognize the policy being needed. However the example they gave us of people sitting and hogging tables for an hour before ordering is unacceptable. We had someone who needed so accommodation, which was no where close to unreasonable. As a Madison native, who's been there ton's I was really disappointed. The Old Fashioned is a Wisconsin gem... but so much for Wisconsin nice."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Madison. I come here every time I'm in town. Such a nice up-scale twist on classic Wisconsin food. I love the cheese plate appetizers! They have great breakfast options and great salads. As a vegetarian I have lots of things to choose from here! Great bloody marys with lots of veggies and beer chaser! It can get very busy on weekend mornings during the summer since its right across from the farmers market. And it's a great night life spot too!"}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is the quintessential embodiment of Wisconsin food and drink. They have reasonable prices, an extensive beer list, great (brandy) old fashioned cocktails, and tasty food. Whenever we have guests from out of town, we take them here to experience some of the best cheese curds in town, and a classic Madison dining atmosphere. I specifically recommend their salad with dried Door County cherries, as well as their burgers and sandwiches.  The inability to make reservations means that there is frequently a long wait, so this may not be the place to go on a weekend (or even a weeknight) if you are in a rush. However, they will take your name and phone number and send you an automated message when your table is ready. I've never had a problem going down the street for a drink or two while I wait, and the wait is always worth it."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is 100% Wisconsin (great selection of Wisconsin beers, Schlitz signs all over the place, lots of meat and cheese on the menu) but does it in a gourmet way. Stopped by for brunch, good service. The rest of the party had creative burgers or the top-notch macaroni and cheese, while I had the Wisconsin Benedict, featuring a bratwurst patty and mustard cream sauce. Delicious, very well cooked! Will definitely be back to work through the beers and the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a modern take on a couple Wisconsin staples:  the eponymous cocktail and the supper club.  In my book, the Old Fashioned gets 5 stars for it's beverage service, 5 stars for it's food and also 5 stars for service.  For beer aficionados, they have a huge assortment of beers, but note they only serve beer made in Wisconsin. You're in luck, beer drinker. Wisconsin makes a lot of awesome beer.  For cocktail drinkers, you must order an Old Fashioned. The Wisconsin way is with brandy. [Wisconsin consumption of brandy dwarfs any other part of the world, stemming back to the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 where Korbel's Brandy had its coming out party of sorts.] Of course, there are many ways to have an Old Fashioned, and they have a customized menu so you can have them craft a perfect one for you.  Most reviews mention the cheese curds for a good reason. They have some of the best hand made fried cheese curds on the planet. I lived in Wisconsin for 23 years and consider myself an authority on the subject. These things are outstanding.  As for food, I don't have specific recommendations, but I've never had a bad dish, and I've never left even remotely hungry.  I try to fit The Old Fashioned into my schedule whenever I'm back in Madison. It's truly an Isthmus Icon."}
{"text":"Now this place says Wisconsin, with a capital W! Seriously folks, The Old Fashioned (named after that drink that every drinks up here, the brandy old fashioned, I'm sure) will bring you back to your Wisconsin heritage or make you wish you had been brought up here!   Fashioned like the old supper clubs that populate Wisconsin towns, the Old Fashioned serves only the food and spirits that made Wisconsin famous.   The extensive beer list both in bottles and on tap- are all brewed in Wisconsin. There are at least 30 beers on tap and countless others in bottles. And the prices on some things made me giddy with joy. How about Blatz for $1 a can? Or Hamm's at the same price? $2 will buy you a horny goat (hey- what can I say? I didn't name them!) And $3.25 will get you a Stickey McDoogle.   Like cheese? They have a variety of cheese flights with all the cheese from the BelGioioso dairy in Denmark, WI. Check out their Burrata- it's mozzarella wrapped around cream and mozzarella pieces amazing! Or try their Mac and cheese . . it comes with a piece of ring bologna . . . .now when was the last time you had that except at your grandma's house?   They also have nightly specials. On the Monday that we were there- all burgers were buy one get one for $5.95. The place was packed and everyone was eating burgers.   We took a different path and went with the walleye sandwich served with your choice of fries, potato salad or salad and the grilled cheese with bacon (no tomatoes as they grow their own and only have them in house in August according to our server . . . .interesting) We also started with a Wisconsin tradition of deep fried cheese curds that were so fresh and good- I thought for a moment that I had died and gone to heaven! All the food was quite good- but what can be wrong with fried, cheesy food?   Our server was great- patient as we looked over the large menu and allowing us to customize a few things.   I haven't lived in Wisconsin for years. But with one push of a door- all those years came flooding back to mind. Now if I could only find my bowling shoes and Green Bay Packer jersey, I'd be all set!"}
{"text":"Went here twice on a trip to Madison, ate at the bar both times. Service is friendly and helpful. The fried cheese curds are amazing - eat them hot for the ultimate in delicious gooeyness. Their burgers are also great. The food prices are reasonable, particularly given their location and tourist appeal. With 150 beers available and many of them local made, this is a great place to familiarize yourself with the local brews. Bartenders are happy to advise you and let you sample before ordering a pint. I'd recommend this to anyone coming to Madison. Has a family-friendly vibe during the day but turns into a cool night spot."}
{"text":"Good food.  Great menu items for kids!  Cons: Busy (which explains the 4 stars), and Loud.  Overall, worth the trouble it takes to find a parking spot!"}
{"text":"Our hotel van driver recommended this place.  It's fun because it's right down by the capitol.  It's very popular and noisy so don't come here if you're looking for a quiet evening out.  We came for the Friday night fish fry.  We has a sweet server with a small voice who was a little hard to hear. But she was very attentative.  We got the the #2 cheese plater to start.  It was quite good and came with crackers, sliced apple, honey and walnuts.  For our entres, we split a spinach salad (very good) and a combo fish fry.  The cod was just \"ok\", but the walleye and the perch was quite good.  The fries were average and so was the cole slaw.  Overall, the food was pretty good and it was a fun place with nice people.  Get there before 5:30pm or you'll have a wait."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: Wisconsin bites and libations, done right.  Short and sweet, The Old Fashioned serves Wisconsin staples and prepares drinks to local tastes better than most. Their titular Brandy Old Fashioned cocktails are the best I've had and a steal at $4. The Cheese Curds are gooey and greasy. Their draught beer selection is hard to beat. The Beer-Cheese Soup comes with popcorn on top.  It's my #1 recommendation for non-Wisconsinites in Madison for a bit."}
{"text":"What's not to like about the Old Fashioned, it has an up north like layed back atmosphere when it's not busy and it's right across from the state Capitol, with a handful of old fashioned and Bloody Mary options for brunch.Try the Summer sausage sandwich and the Northern Wisconsin bar snacks, I just wish they had Blind Robin's, does anybody remember them?"}
{"text":"Their check in tech was nice. They text you when a table is ready. Having a drink and hanging out in the mean time was easy to do. Their Spicey Burger was awesome! Service first rate. Atmosphere fun!"}
{"text":"We go to Madison about once a month for various Badger sporting events. Sometimes we do double-headers and have to find somewhere to kill some time between the two events.   Let me put in here that I was a little disappointed by Yelp Madison - the top 10 reviews are for bakeries and coffee houses, making it difficult to find what locals think is a great place to eat.   Anyway, we ended up choosing the Old Fashioned a few days in advance, so I spent some time looking at the menu online and was really looking forward to trying some of their food.   Because of the timing of the events, we got there about 4:30. The place was still pretty busy considering it was pre-dinner time. It's a good thing we got there at that time, since it was absolutely stuffed to the gills by the time we left at 6.   Despite having like 140 beers, they carry just one hard cider, which I think is a little ridiculous. But I ordered it. It wasn't very good.   So I perused the giant beer menu and went for an apple New Glarus I'd had elsewhere and loved. They were out of it. And before I could even go back to the menu, the waitress let me know they were out of 2 other fruit beers. However, the waitress suggested a beer on special that, based on the name, I'd never had tried, but it was quite good. So good on her for knowing the flavor profiles of what they had available.   Since it was early, I was still pretty stuffed from lunch and the meals there all looked huge. I knew from Yelp that the fried cheese curds were a must and I couldn't imagine how I'd handle a whole meal, so I decided to piece on together.   I ordered the curds for us to share, then ordered a side of the dill potato salad and a bowl of the beer cheese soup.   The curds were as advertised - spectacular. But everything else was a disappointment.   The beer cheese soup is clearly made with sharp cheddar - it had that good, sharp bite. But it was also incredibly gritty because hard cheese like that doesn't melt well. You could see the gritty pieces all over the spoon. It was just an unpleasant texture.  Also, because it was so sharp, it was kind of a lot - if you know what I mean. It needed some bread or a pretzel or .... something to break up the strong flavor. It came with a small packet of oyster crackers, but those just soaked up the soup and didn't accomplish anything.   And the dill potato salad didn't taste anything like dill. It was ok, but not great, but I as someone who loves dill, I was really looking forward to it so the lack of flavor really disappointed me.   So I think the food was probably pretty ok, but after reading the menu I was really looking forward to these things and they failed to meet my expectations.   The boyfriend, incidentally, had the Saturday night Prime Rib special and it was delicious. He ordered the \"small\" and the plate was huge, with a giant mound of onion strings, which I don't think he even touched, plus a baked potato and the Prime Rib. The Prime Rib was melt-in-your-mouth.   I wish my meal had lived up to the promise of one bite of his.   We were in the room off to the left of the hostess station and there is a long bar there. As the restaurant got more and more crowded, so did the bar and there just wasn't room for all those people. Folks were bumping into the back of the BFs chair and the servers couldn't even get through."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of 8 on a Friday night. I put my name down around 6pm and our table was ready by 6:45pm, which was not bad at all considering I've tried to come here several times before and been deterred by the wait! The snowy weather might have kept some crowds away though.   We started off with a round of old fashioneds because it just seemed like the right thing to do. I had a yummy whiskey old fashioned and was also surprised at the reasonable price for the cocktail - just around $6 which seems fair considering they're so busy that they could probably charge more.   The Fish Fry I ordered was also yummy and reasonably priced - just under $10 for a couple of perfectly battered and fried pieces of cod, a heaping portion of fries, cole slaw, and a couple pieces of bread. The service was prompt and friendly, and they were able to split our checks for us several different ways without batting an eye. Definitely a great place to go with locals and out of towners alike as long as you plan ahead and know you'll likely be waiting a little bit."}
{"text":"I was in town in business and I told a guy who works for me that I wanted to go to a local joint and he brought me here. I have to say I wasn't disappointed. The location is great right by the Capitol and the restaurants has a great feel to it. We had an appetizer of cheese platter and a sausage platter and they were excellent. I had the burger with egg on it and the meat was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. Of course the drinks were great especially the apple old fashioned. If you are in town looking for something that is not a chain give this place a shot"}
{"text":"I really used to love the Old Fashioned, but when I was there recently, I was super disappointed. Granted, my friend and I were there around 10pm, they were gearing up for karaoke, and we were seated outside, but the service was positively lousy. The server wasn't told we were out there, and we sat for at least 20 minutes before someone came out to us. We continued to feel mostly ignored for the rest of our meal.   We ordered a cheese plate (the #1), two salads, and fries. The fries were the only item that didn't disappoint (crispy, salty, and hot). The cheese plate had three very small pieces of cheese (though they were very good), some walnuts and crackers, and none of the fruit that the menu promised. I ordered the salad with salmon, which was mostly a bunch of mixed greens that hadn't even been dressed/tossed properly, with a little bit of cucumber, onion, and a tiny sprinkle of bacon bits. The fish was a bit overcooked as well. My friend ordered a large green salad, which didn't even seem to have any dressing on it at all.   Our press brandy Old Fashioneds were delicious, but not quite enough to make up for the overall disappointment of the meal."}
{"text":"Popular eatery right across the street from the WI state capital. It's always a good sign when the place is packed and there is a wait. We waited for about 15 minutes and they paged us via cell phone.   The menu has some great options as well as daily specials. It seems many items are locally sourced and they were featuring a BLT made with local tomatoes. I love a good farm-to-table restaurant. Of course we had to get the fried cheese curds even though this goes against most of my eating principles, but hey, this is Wisconsin and it's mandatory to eat cheese curds!  They were delicious.   For my entree I ordered a local trout over a bed of spinach. The fish is served whole: head and everything - this may scare some people like it did my dinner companion. However it was very good and fresh. I have to say that the spinach was WAY overdressed with the sauce. So much so that I could not eat it. Too much sauce!  The Old Fashioned also features beer from 150 Wisconsin breweries, which is cool.   If you are ever near the WI state capital give The Old Fashioned a try."}
{"text":"Is it any surprise that the star of the show are the Old Fashioned's?  I tried the House Infused Cherry Old Fashioned, which uses Door County cherries.  Let's just say, if ever my friends or family can't find me, they should check here and I will undoubtedly be sipping away on these.  I don't even have the words to describe how truly tickled my tastebuds were on this one.   My friend tried the Apple Jack and Sweet Corn Old Fashioned's.  The Sweet Corn one was very unique.  It wasn't bad.  Just unique.  She was a fan of the Apple Jack one for sure.    Since her dad had not ever had cheese curds before (I couldn't believe it either, but in his defense, he is not from the area), we ordered some to share.  I really loved the light airy batter on them.  They also offer a variety of different dipping sauces.  I personally loved the blue tiger sauce, but the garlic and paprika sauces were also delectable.  I will just say that we did not stop at 1 round of cheese curds, we definitely ordered another.  YUM.  Our server (well, both servers, since one was in training) was fantastic.  He knew how to read our needs and had the most outstanding personality.  This is a must try for out-of-towners, which is why I brought my friend and her dad here.  They were definitely impressed!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm grade inflating here. After a five-day experiment with veganism, which is probably not advisable on a two-day Amtrak ride or for the ensuing visit to a state that names its beers after cows, maybe I was just really hangry and sick of tofu and fried mushrooms. But the Old Fashioned treated us right, and after a lot of mediocre pub and food truck fare in Madison, this place seemed about as good as it gets.   Situated  right on Capitol Square and ideal for general people/tourist watching, OF has a small sidewalk seating area in front and a bar and dining are inside. It's, well, old and woody looking, but in a classy way and not a divey way, and it's a good atmosphere to eat in, sans trendy music and with the sole TV over the bar turned down. The giant front windows allow for fun staring at the square and its goings-on.  Because everything is about goddamned free in the Midwest, something I forget when I've been away for a while, I bought a giant, table-share appetizer plate (pickled beets, sliced pickles, pickled green beans, two cheese spreads, deviled eggs, potato salad and crackers); three pints of local craft brew (two West-Coast-style and an English-ish IPA--all very good) and a whole freakin' rainbow trout with sides for $50. I sometimes recycle my oh-so-pithy aphorism that \"I've paid much less for much more,\" but this one's the inverse: I've paid a lot more for food, drink, and service not this good.   So, the menu scorecard says that the  legendary fried cheese curds dipped in cheese are damned cheesy, in the best way. Mac-n'-cheese (in case you missed the \"we're in Wisconsin\" bit) with asparagus: shizzle, man, I don't even like macaroni and cheese, and this was magical. And my whole trout was the whole haul for my hole. Sometimes, some thyme and some spinach and some more beets really hit the spot, and, awwww yeah: it was awwn. (Okay, I will stop doing this review in 1997 faux-urban slang. I'm old and have been drinking and sometimes I can't help it.)   Our server (Steve, I think?) was cool and gave good beer advice. The staff  collaborate and run each other's food and bus and refill water, the way that brothas and sistas oughtta. Okay, I promised to stop that. Anyway, this is a low five, but still a five. If you're in Madison, or live in Madison, for that matter, you should come here."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!  The atmosphere was so welcoming; sat at the bar.  Nate was our bartender and he was great!  We each had an IPA draft and we ordered the Lazy Susan #7 and added a side of sausage.  When the food came, we laughed out loud because it was A LOT!!  It definitely would have been more appropriate for a group of 4-6 people but we had plenty to take home!!  Definitely think this is a spot to add to your travels if you're ever in Madison!"}
{"text":"I had the cheese curds which were very oily. You could tell the quality of cheese used was much better than others I have had. For the entree I had the Bacon Mac and Cheese. It was very heavily, but the bacon made it overly salty. Overall, not bad, but not great either."}
{"text":"How could I resist the $1.50 beer of the month - mind you, it was served in a 8oz snifter, but still!  It provided a fun opportunity to sample something I might not otherwise have tried.  Their beer list was quite extensive, with lots of tempting options.    I liked the setting and friendly atmosphere of The Old Fashioned.  Our server was quite personable and knowledgeable.  One downside is that there really are not a lot of vegetarian options on the menu.  You're really limited to a couple of salad choices or one sandwich.  The sandwich was good - Grilled eggplant, portabella mushroom, wood-roasted red pepper and zucchini, with goat cheese and black olive tapenade on toasted country bread, served with a generous portion of either fries or a salad.  The house burger (which no, Mom, I didn't try, I'm still a vegetarian, quit getting your hopes up) got good reviews from our table, after the surprise passed of it being served with an egg, bacon, and cheese.  BOTTOM LINE: A fun, casual spot downtown.  Huge selection of great beer options along with good service and reasonable prices.  Add a few more vegetarian-friendly options to the menu and I think we'd have a hit!"}
{"text":"A gal like me would be found in a place called \"The Old Fashioned.\"  I'm a lover and collector of typewriters, Polaroid cameras, anything old and fogey-ish.  Add in the Wisconsin culture, and I am sold.    This place screams 'Sconnie from the curds to the selection of local beers to the ability to add Braunschweiger or ring bologna to menu items.  Pickled egg anyone?  I didn't partake in any of these goodies, but I did get curds as well as sample several beers (go with the sampler glasses set in a little wooden Wisconsin).  I also tried the Wisconsin style old fashioned with Korbel.  It's sweeter than the traditional one, but I have a spot in my heart for it nonetheless.  My sandwich was good, the curds were better.    This place is popular and does get crowded, but I do hope to brave those crowds on a repeat trip sooner rather than later.  Hold the pickled eggs."}
{"text":"The food I've had there has been relatively good.  The Wed/Fri night fish fry was great.  They have quite a few interesting drinks, so I don't have to stick to the vodka & soda routine that usually have to.  I like the place a lot, though, as far as service & environment.  It's really casual, and any Wisconsin sporting event (Packers, Brewers, Badgers, Bucks) will be on their TVs.  My boyfriend LOVES the food, maybe I've just had a couple mediocre rarities.  He gets the Old Fashioned Burger, which has a cooked egg on the top - I think it sounds gross but he swears up & down that it's GREAT, and he's an expert :)  All of the servers & bartenders I've interacted with have been polite, accomodating, helpful, and went out of their way to accomodate and be nice to us.  The mac & cheese is also excellent ;)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here while passing through Madison. Unsurprisingly, the old fashioned's here are quite good and very reasonably priced for a city. We had the fried cheese curds, beer and cheese soup, a sausage platter, and a bacon grilled cheese. Entirely too much food for a couple of people. The beer and cheese soup was our favorite. The cheese curds were also good, but the order is so large you may not be able to eat anything else if you finish it."}
{"text":"This is a must-visit every time we're in Madison, so long as we get there early enough to snag a table for dinner.  While perusing the beer and cocktail lists, enjoy a basket of fried cheese curds with the tiger sauce - its horseradish kick is a perfect complement to the all the gooeyness, provided you can put up with the grease pooling in the bottom of the basket.  I can't stomach a real old fashioned, but the orange version, which is rum-based, is deliciously dangerous.  The beer list is lengthy and focuses on local craft brewers, so a FIBer like me can get some New Glarus and other brews that aren't in Chicago.  As for food, items can be hit or miss.  The lazy susans offer a variety of small, snacky portions that quickly add up to a meal (bread and crackers, cheese spread, baby beets, hummos, etc.).  The pulled pork sandwich is excellent, as are the salads and burgers, but stay away from the disappointingly bland turkey sandwich.  Even with tiger sauce, it is flavorless."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned could possibly be Madison's most famous restaurant. Their pub style fare, is good...but not in my opinion, worth the usually horrendous wait times because they also don't take reservations. They have a humongous beer selection, but I had the cranberry spritzer (a holiday cocktail special). That was super tastey. If you come here, getting cheese curds is a must! We did this in addition to getting a cheese spread and crackers appetizer. My boyfriend got the ribeye and I got a pork sandwich. We were both too full to finish our entrees. I will be back, I would just say this experience with our wait time, bar service and table service was very slow and did not leave us feeling we we're appreciated as patrons. Considering other Madison restaurants that priotize this, it was an unusual feeling."}
{"text":"I feel it's super over rated. Both my and my fiance's food was bland and the service was mediocre"}
{"text":"We came for a late dinner so no wait. They sat us in the front room where our table faced the capitol building. Although it was a drizzly, cold night, we had a beautiful view.  The drinks... strong AF... I can't even remember what we got--we took the server's suggestions.  I ordered the No. 30 The Old Fashioned House Burger: grilled over a live fire and topped with fried onions, Bavaria's hickory-smoked bacon, aged Cheddar, garlic sauce and a soft-cooked egg on a buttered and toasted roll.\" Upgraded the side to House-made fresh Wisconsin beer-battered cheese curds +$3. Huge burger and tons of curds. If you have small appetites, you could share this. Curds were standard. Burger was juicy, messy and good.   Our server was not the friendliest. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt; it was nearing the end of the night and we were indecisive on what food/drinks to order."}
{"text":"Great Place for lunch! Of course we tried the cheese curds that were written about in every review on here!  They are good - not sure if they are the worlds best, but they def are good! Had a great lunch, sat outside, enyjoyed the views."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place so much we went there twice.We also started drinking Wisconsin brandy old fashions at home."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best breakfasts that I ever had! The breakfast old fashioned was incredible and the portion sizes were huge and beyond delicious! I cannot say enough good things about this place. No wonder this place has had a line out the door every time we have tried to get in!"}
{"text":"Occasionally for work I find myself in Madison, and stay near the Capital. Walking distance is The Old Fashioned. What sold me initially was the curiosity of cheese curds. By far the best in Madison (been to several other places around the square). It's classy dive with dim lighting, tons of seating, and even more beer choices.  The food is all around phenomenal. The beer cheese soup with popcorn on top is a favorite go-to. The iconic Old Fashion drink is nothing short of impressive. Even their selection of dipping sauces will blow you away.  Every time I have gone it's been crowded, but always a fun crowd. Was there Halloween night two years ago and the atmosphere from the costumes was hilarious and upbeat. For being a college town, some might be weary, but I can assure you it's nothing to worry about.   I hear locals love it just as much as out of towners. I don't think a trip to Madison is complete without stopping by."}
{"text":"I came to Madison to visit my brother recently and this is where he took me. He said, 'we need to go to The Old Fashioned because it's December and they'll be serving their cherry bounce'   so I said, 'what is a cherry bounce?'  Apparently all year they soak cherries in separate jars of vodka, brandy and bourbon. Yummo!  We tried each kind. To be honest, they all just tasted like cherry pie to me - so no difference between the different alcohol mixes. But! They were all AMAZING! If you're in Madison in December at all, be sure to check this out. Delicious! Also, there's nothing like a seasonal special - especially when it's seasonal because it takes all year!  I had their mac and cheese to eat which was delicious. My brother and I also got a cheese plate (the no. 1) in advance, and that too was incredible. The staff was friendly and sweet.   Tip: on a Friday you have to get there probably before/at 5:00 if you want to get a table."}
{"text":"greasy wisconsin goodness.  the vegetarian sandwich is REALLY greasy.  The salads are awesome.  I mean, who really goes on and on about a salad?  I never did, until I ate here.  I love the brandy vinaigrette it is so good!!  I wish they would bottle it and sell it cause I'd buy it for sure!  the onion strings are horribly amazing.  then the cheese curds, duh.  wow.    the cheese platter is pricey, but good.    Bomb Bloody Marys.  Now I have to go get myself one.  Right now."}
{"text":"Very good. I like that I know exactly what to expect when I go. Love the atmosphere of the place and I never really mind waiting for up to 45 minutes to be seated. I've had brunch, dinner, and drinks/cheese curds here. I want to try new places and come here less... but I just end up here all the time especially when there are visitors because I know they won't disappoint. Protocol for me is to put my name down, go to the back bar, drink a beer and hang out, and time flies~ Dinner is served pretty quickly. Food and drink menu is extensive. I've seen ~20 of the food items (I've eaten like.. 5...) and no one was ever disappointed. Their old-fashioned drink is pretty tasty too.. and I'm not that big on old fashioneds usually..."}
{"text":"Went for bloody Mary's and lucked out and got seats at the bar. This place is always busy on the weekends and has a wait to get in. The bloody was really good and it had a meal in it. The beef jerky was of great quality and was the star. It came with a huge piece jerky, hard boiled egg, pickle, mushroom, olive, lemon and cheese curds. This is my favorite bloody place in Maddison, see my pictures."}
{"text":"I am giving The Old Fashioned a 5 star rating, not because it's the best restaurant I have ever eaten at but because it is best at what it offers - Wisconsin comfort food and drink.  I don't feel the need to reiterate what most have already said about the excellent beer selection and many menu choices.  I will say that my favorite is the #22, the wedge salad, a huge dinner sized salad that will leave you craving more (who knew you could actually crave a salad?).  They serve it up with French AND Bleu Cheese dressing and it's a combo that makes this salad unbeatable.  I always have to get an order of the fantastic onion strings and a couple servings of Tiger Blue sauce.    Besides the great food and drink selections, the atmosphere is fun and inviting. A great place to meet a group of friends and just enjoy.  Welp, writing this review has made me really hungry... maybe I'll hit The Old Fashioned for lunch."}
{"text":"Very, very busy & crowded but fun.  Had an absolutely perfect meal, best Friday night fish fry dinner of my life.  Be prepared to wait for a table, it will be worth your time!"}
{"text":"Supposedly the #1 place for cheese curds in Madison. While they are very good, and don't skip out on the cheese (as opposed to some places, where you're basically eating fried batter), I'd say DLUX or Graze has much better curds.  This restaurant is pretty typical of Madison eats. American pub food that is pretty greasy and  unhealthy. Everyone at my table ordered different dishes and I couldn't find anything remotely forgiving on any plate.   My friend ordered the prime rib (medium well) and said it was delicious. It looked perfectly done, came with a side of toast and fries.  Another friend got the walleye with onion strings, which was greasy and came with 2 pieces of bread that seemed unnecessary.   I got the mac & cheese which was piping hot and a bit bland - definitely would try with either ham or bacon next time.  Service was alright, food was okay. There are other places around that are better for you - food wise, and health wise."}
{"text":"This place is about as Wisconsin as it gets.  Awesome curds, huge meat and cheese plates, and a great selection of beers and cocktails.  Definitely come here for something to fill you up, not if you're on a diet.  This has been one of my go-to places since moving here!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait. Accept that you will have to wait during busier times and build your appetite. Farmers Market, football weekends, state government sessions pack the place understandably. Patience."}
{"text":"Great Walleye fish sandwich and cheese curd. Never had either, but I enjoyed them both. I guess I'm a rookie when it comes to Madison, Wi. I would definitely go back if the opportunity arises. Enjoy..."}
{"text":"I was honestly expecting more given the mostly positive reviews.  It's good food at a reasonable price.  It seems like a more refined version of a WI/MN supper club, especially the Old Fashioned Burger with the fried egg as a topping.    I didn't try the beer or the curds - those are for another time."}
{"text":"First of all, the fried cheese curds are sooooooooooo delicious!!!! Order the before you even look at theresy of the menue! They are fluffy, chewy and just perfect. Never thought I could write that about cheese curds!  Overall, the experience was great!! We came in and got seated right away. The service was super quick and the staff was very friendly. The portions were pretty big and could be shared between two people. We got a bowl of chili and a roasted turkey sandwich with side of salad, which was delicious!  I would for sure come back and would recomend you check it out if you are in the area.  Didn't get to try but the drink menue looked good too!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch.  Had the house burger with a side of beer battered cheese curds.  Hands down, top 3 burgers I have eaten in my life.  May be number one.  Burger was cooked perfectly and the beer battered cheese curds were simply amazing.  Bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable and helped make a few great choices in local beers.  I wish there was a place like this back home."}
{"text":"My burger was overcooked and the cheese curds were pretty salty."}
{"text":"We kept it simple... a cheese plate & the Wurst Plate.   All of it was outstanding, great cheeses & the various meats went well with the cheese.      The service here is surprising good considering how jammed packed it was during a Sunday Brunch.   Our drink glasses never came close to being empty and when we did need something, the wait staff was on top of it.   If you happen to get a window seat, it's actually a nice view of the Capitol Square!"}
{"text":"Great cheese curds for those looking for the real wisconsin.   Stopped @ the Old Fashioned while driving across the country and it was definitely worth the time. The hostess did write in our phone number wrong and created a bit of a mix up when waiting for our table, but they resolved it quickly. The wait staff was friendly, but not too in our face. And the food was super tasty - great place to try cheese curds for the first time. Make sure you eat them while they are piping hot, they are not as yummy as they cool. Super reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was very crowded. Staff was attentive and friendly. Cheese curds were the best I've had. Ordered the double down hotdog and fries. Fries were hard and cold. Hot dogs were standard faire."}
{"text":"Here for dinner and drinks on a busy Saturday afternoon/night.   If there is another establishment in Madison with a better Wisconsin beer list, I haven't found it. Hundreds of beers to choose from with prices that are phenomenal (Average price $4 for a regular bottle and a 750 ml bottle of New Glarus Belgian Red was just $11!) and a very solid combination menu for crafting your own Old Fashioned (complete with Ginger Beer for an extra $0.50 - nicely done) and that pretty much concludes the highlights from our visit.   Unfortunately, it seems that every time I visit the area, every decent bar/restaurant downtown is packed, and this place is no exception. We had an hour and a half wait before getting a drafty table by the window and the server appeared to be having a rather bad night as I don't believe she said more than 10 words to us while we were there (and that includes \"good evening\" upon her first coming to the table). Food arrived quickly though, drinks a short time later (it would have been nice to have the drinks first, but the bar was absolutely jammed). Overall, the food is ok, not great, not terrible, but the overall combination of the great Old Fashioned drinks and the beer selection/prices make up for the other inconveniences of coming to this place.  We would likely come back if it weren't so busy, but if there is a wait, this place wouldn't be on our list of places that we have to come back to check out."}
{"text":"I have been to the Old Fashion many times and have always been pleased.  Today's visit was no different.  Delicious!   I ordered a whiskey old fashion sour and it was made perfectly!   We also ordered the fried cheese curds which were super yummy and quite a generous portion.  My friend ordered one of their salads that cherries and blue cheese, it was very good....the salad was huge fortunately,  because I helped her eat it   The service was very quick despite having a full dining room and bar."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed  I have heard many positive things about this restaurant over the years, and unfortunately it did not live up to the hype.   We ordered cheese curds and two burgers. The cheese curds were pretty greasy. I think this is due mostly to a very thin layer of breading that doesn't hold the oil in. I prefer cheese curds with more substantial breading, so these were not my favorite.  Our burgers were also greasier than I am accustomed to. After cutting mine in half, I had pink grease sliding around my plate. The flavor of the burger was disappointing--an overpowering amount of pepper masked the flavor of the meat. The fries, though hot and crispy, were nothing special.   Overall, I wouldn't go back to eat. It's probably a better place to meet for drinks."}
{"text":"I realized that I forgot to review this spot!  I visited in the summer for brunch (I was very excited to slightly divert from a somewhat in the middle of nowhere location for food!).  We started off sitting inside, but the air conditioning was overwhelming and so we moved outside to the patio.    We tried the cheese spreads and a bunch of food since everything sounded delicious.  I also tried one of the specialty mimosas.  The food was ok, definitely delicious, and I enjoyed the cheese spreads.  I wasn't overly impressed, though.  It could be my lackluster love for Ritz crackers, or just that I ordered incorrectly.  So, while it was tasty, I don't know if I'd drive the hour again to eat there (though I think I'd like to stop by for lunch as the menu looked delish).  Service was really friendly and people watching was fun on the patio.  Good for a stop if you're in Madison and I would expect that it would be fun for a drink in the summer as the bar area was cute.  Go for lunch/dinner and I think you may be more wowed by the food."}
{"text":"Quintessential Madison spot to recommend or to which you bring any of your out-of-town visitors. Awesome vibe. Great beer list and brandy slush. Tough to live up to being widely credited with having best cheese curds in town, but they do a really good job. Onion strings are sneaky awesome too. Burger gets a lot of hype but don't be afraid to branch out."}
{"text":"This was all it was hyped to be. A friend from the area had given me the recommendation and I'm glad that I took him up on it. Just a great meal from the start and the service there was good. You have to realize that you don't order at your table -- so if you are seated at the bar you can order from a bar tender, but if you are at a table with your group, you will go up to the counter and order that way.  Food was excellent and plenty of folks were having bloody marys' or other beverages during lunch time on a Tuesday. I enjoyed it enough to go back a second time later in the trip."}
{"text":"Stopped in Madison on our way through to Wasau for a softball tournament. Delicious. I had the grilled vegetable sandwich which was outstanding. Bread and vegetables grilled to perfection and the black olive spread was the perfect condiment. I got the tossed salad as my side and it was perfectly dressed. Not too much, not too little. My daughter had the grilled chicken, bacon, and Swiss cheese. It came on the same grilled bread as my sandwich. She, too, thought it was tasty. My husband had the tacos since that was the Tuesday night special. We were all pleased with our food. We were shocked at how busy the restaurant was for a random Tuesday night. This place was hoppin'. Well priced for the amount of food served. Roughly $8 per meal."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Wisconsin's finest. The place was busy, huge selection of local beer at a fair price, cheese curds great, service, specifically bar tender Nate and Katy were very good. I'll be back. Wonderful taste of Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Ok food with traumatizing service. When we asked for silverware we were told \"there should already be some on the table\". Waited 35 min for a 5 top and felt unwelcome the whole time. Bar service was good but hostess and wait staff are inhospitable. Waitress didn't ask us if we wanted to split the tab."}
{"text":"Wow the curds are phenomenal !! Great place friendly staff with awesome service!! Will definitely go back for sure. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best cheese curds in Madison.  Awesome food and great beer selection too.  A Madison must."}
{"text":"Second time visiting while in town for the week. Food is amazing! Atmosphere is fantastic! Beer is great! Location is perfect! Both times I went I had the old fashioned burger, it is one of the best burgers ever. Side salad was good and fries were really good too. For appetizers we had the cheese curds! Best we have had while in Wisconsin.  Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the Beer Cheese soup. Just wasn't great.  Wife had the prime rib dinner on Saturday special. Best prime rib ever. Shame  I didn't get it :(.  Next thing we had was the Mac n cheese with Bologna sausages. It was very rich but very good! Favorite beer on tap is the local cherry wheat, awesome! Tip... The paprika dipping sauce is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great spot for casual dining.  Stopped on a Monday and was able to get a seat at the bar.  Friendly and prompt service and consistent food.  Excellent cheese plate.  Wish they could do more with their deviled eggs.  Salads don't disappoint.   Beer drinkers will love the selection.  They also have a bourbon flight - fun for all of us bourbon lovers."}
{"text":"house burger was pretty awesome. me and my buddy were a little bit apprehensive about the fried egg on the burger, but when in rome...great place to settle in and enjoy local food."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place, unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations.  As usual, when visiting Madison, the hubby and I check Yelp for a cool place to chill, sample some local brew, and get away from the relatives.    As a native Wisconsinite, I was excited about getting some deep fried cheesecurds.  I'd heard really good things about the curds here, but unfortunately, they let me down.  They would have been outstanding if they'd been fried to a crisp.  Unfortunately, they were soggy and blah.  Next, we tried the New England Clam Chowder (not very Wisconsin, but hey).  I'm certain that it was straight out of a can.  It was fine...if you like Campbell's, but we were hoping for something more fresh, and less bland.    At the suggestion of my brother, the hubby ordered a walleye sandwich and fries for his entree.  I'm not a fish purveyor, so maybe this is typical, but it had no flavor.  None.  The fries were clearly not made onsite, and they too, were not done as much as they should have been.   I ordered the #40, a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon on Texas Toast and a side of onion strings.  The grilled cheese was so good!  It was gooey, the bacon crisp, and the toast was buttery.  Score!  The onion stings were not fried enough.    My hubby ordered a flight of beer to try the local offerings.  The server told us that when ordering, you have to stick to one page, since the pages don't communicate.  it's almost like you're ordering from a different establishment if you order from one page or the other.  Weird.  The hubby enjoyed the vast selection.  Our bill came to around $50.  Normally I don't mind paying that much for a good meal, but I walked out feeling disappointed.  If the soup had been fresh and the curds, fries, and strings had been done enough, this would have been a great meal.  The atmosphere was loud and crowded.  We sat at a table that never should have been placed where it was.  It was near a door so every time someone came in or left, we were blasted with WI winter air.  Also, there was no flow for the servers or the other guests who were waiting so we were frequently bumped and had people breathing over us.  Not cool.  (I'm a huge fan of personal space.)  Like I said, I wanted to like this place.  My sandwich was reasonably priced at around $7, but that and the beer selection are the only things I'd go back for.  I have a feeling the next time we're in Madison, we'll be looking for a new place to try."}
{"text":"I love this place so much I bought a water color painting of this historic building and hung it in my home. I would give them 5 stars but their already too busy..  Used to love it , now I avoid it like tap water in Mexico. 45 minute wait with 4 empty tables and a snotty hostess...Good Bye!!!"}
{"text":"I swung in here for breakfast one morning in Sept. while in Madison for a conference my husband was attending.  I had bookmarked them for dinner, but was excited to see that they also served breakfast.  My breakfast was excellent!  Server was friendly and quick and the food was hot and fast to the table.  Next time we are in town we will try for dinner too!"}
{"text":"My family and I drove to Madison yesterday from Chicago just for a day of relaxing & good eats. I googled, \"Best cheese curds in Madison\" and The Old Fashioned came up as #1, so we figured we might as well give it a go.  We were astounded with how busy it was. I mean, the was a regular ol Monday evening and the place was jumping! My dad made a joke and said that there was more people in that restaurant alone then cars on the road lol. We ordered The Lazy Susan, beer battered cheese curds and fish sticks. We weren't to hungry, but wanted to try a little variety of stuff. I've had cheese boards from some of Chicago's best establishments: the publican, soho house, avec, longman and eagle, lula cafe I mean the list really goes on & I kid you not -- this $12.95 charcuterie plate takes the cake!! I know it doesn't have the same visual appeal as some of the other restaurants I listed off, but the flavor!! Everything was so fresh and yummy it really wins by long haul.  Def recommend this place for families visiting Madison. They accommodate large groups really easily with no discrepancies."}
{"text":"Classic Wisconsin food - cheese & sausage plate, cheese curds, local brews,etc.  Love to take my out-of-town guests here."}
{"text":"This was good, real good.  If I were you, I would make plans to come two days in a row, because we ordered way too much food because everything looks so good.  If you already have a second visit planned, you won't be tempted to over-order!  This food is delivered with plenty of style and flavor, but is plenty fatty and heavy, and you need to leave room for some of the 20-odd beers they have on tap.  We ordered a sausage platter to share, and I got their signature burger for myself and an Old Fashioned cocktail.  Everything in the burger was great - superior quality and individually delicious.  The overall effect was overwhelming - garlic spread, the great beefy taste, the bacon, the egg, the buttered bun, the sweet onions, and more, were all competing for attention.  Next time, I'd get a much simpler burger and enjoy it very much, I'm sure.  I'd hoped for an \"authentic\" Old Fashioned from a restaurant which takes its name from the cocktail, but the cocktail snob in me was a little disappointed.  It was very well executed for a \"modern\" Old Fashioned, and I enjoy the Wisconsin style with brandy, but 'twas not an old fashioned Old Fashioned.  Alas."}
{"text":"First time at The Old Fashioned, I very much enjoyed the delicious soup of the day of Creamy Potato as well as their fresh salad topped off with the perfect amount of dressing to balance it out. The soup was thick and creamy (however it could have used some more potato pieces or more bacon sprinkles) and the salad was young, fresh and tasty. I definitely look forward coming back to check out their burgars next time.   Service was great, our server was on top of it making sure our food was great as well as refilling our drinks."}
{"text":"Great local Madison spot for food and drinks. The cheese curds are amazing! It can get pretty crowded around lunch and dinner time so you should expect to wait a little bit for a table"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here a number of times in the last year. (She likes to get different entrees; I usually end up with the \"Spicy Burger\" because it's f'ing amazing.) The food is simply outstanding. We usually end up having to wait for a table, but it's worth it for the cheese curds alone. The burgers are the best I've had in Madison to date (and I've lived in the area for over 30 years). The french fries are addictive. So many tasty beers on tap (some of them rotate, so keep an eye on the list!). On top of all that, the service is superb. They are a little bit pricey, but I've never felt like I didn't get my money's worth. $35 (with tip) for two meals, an appetizer, a Coke, and a premium beer is really quite reasonable when it's all so delicious and there's no way you'll leave hungry. As long as they keep making those cheese curds, I will keep coming back. One of these days I'll try their breakfast, too."}
{"text":"Every fried cheese curd from anywhere else is compared to the Old Fashioned...and they are never as good.  Bad for others, good for Old Fashioned.  Their drinks and their cheese curds keep me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and was pretty packed. Sat at the bar and was greeted within minutes. Decided to try this place out because of their beer battered fresh cheese curds. They were absolutely amazing, especially with the paprika sauce! Plus they have a great beer selection of mainly Wisconsin beers! Would highly recommend this place! Awesome service and awesome cheese curds!"}
{"text":"A great Madison staple! A perfect place for visitors to Madison and families. The food is good, the staff is great, overall just a good experience. Cheese curds and a traditional old fashioned drink, don't forget!"}
{"text":"The food at the old fashioned is great. Wonderful Wisconsin food with bold and one of a kind taste. I would love to give it 5 stars, but it is next to impossible to get in here without arriving an hour + ahead. They don't take reservations either. I've actually only been here 2x and I've lived in WI 26 years, and in downtown madison 4 years. The seating here is also not very comfortable."}
{"text":"Probably Madison's most famous restaurant and with good reason. If I have a friend coming to visit me, I will always take them here, and they will always be pleased. The menu is all-american with a Wisconsin twist (lots of cheese, brats, and pretzels). While I think they could do a little better as far as offering healthy options, this is also Wisconsin. Lastly, every time I have been here, the staff has been very friendly and given great service. Which is no surprise because  they have such an intense vetting process for prospect employees. They  have two callback interviews and have their candidates to work one shift before they know if they were hired!. Overall, I love this place."}
{"text":"Great food (burgers).  Nice atmosphere and just steps from the Capitol."}
{"text":"If your looking for great food and drinks in an upbeat energetic atmosphere with a great view of the capital... this is the place. Great for date night or groups...\"out of towners\" it is a MUST! Try a lazy suzan for a crowd pleaser of local fare or grab the cheese curds they are the cheesiest... Extra tiger sauce please! Earlier or later there will be a wait so put in your name and grab an Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a Madison staple. It's usually my go to spot to bring visiting guests to. I have been there more times than I can remember and always find it enjoyable.   The old fashioned burger is one of the best in Madison, the spicy burger is just as good and highly underrated. The pulled pork sandwhich is also very good. Another one of my favorite things about the OF is their sauces. The tiger sauce has a horseradishy kick to it.   You can't get more Wisconsin than this place."}
{"text":"When the family comes to visit, this is our go to dinner spot!  Without a doubt you will have great service, exceptional cheese curds, high quality burgers and sandwiches (don't knock the vegetarian options until you try them), side dishes and everything else. I have never had anything less than a positive experience here.  The 21+'s in my life have also told me that the Bloody Mary's and the Old Fashioned's are exceptional. I'd expect nothing less!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I see a trend forming in my new home of Madison... I like to go to bars in the middle of the day, therefore I end up having the place to myself. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but I find it a little interesting and VERY different from Philadelphia. I arrived here on a Monday at 4pm. The bartender was friendly, he made me an amazing Tom Collins. I ordered the cheese curds while I waited for my fiance to arrive and they were excellent. I can't wait to come back during a more peek customer hour and see how the atmosphere is. The bar is beautiful and there are some really cool historic Madison pictures on the wall. I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent chili and cheesecurds, not that great of service. Burger was well done when I ordered medium."}
{"text":"Let's just get this out of the way: I am very aware that Madisonians consider this place a \"staple\" of downtown, and I frequently hear people rave about their cheese curds and, obviously, their \"old fashioneds\"; that being said, maybe back in the day this place WAS the \"go-to\", but with so many options popping up around the square, you can have a more unique, pleasant, less-packed, and potentially cheaper meal somewhere else.   I do not dislike The Old Fashioned. On a weekday it tends to be less busy and a decent place to stop for a drink and a cheeseplate to share amongst friends. In my experience, these are the days you'll have exceptional service, especially from the bartenders (who are usually REALLY friendly, but also REALLY busy on a weekend or during a dinner service, naturally). Their beer selection is great, and they do feature unique drink specials that are worth giving the place a try!  That being said, the menu is not very creative in contrast to many of the restaurants along the square and the food is alright, but not really something to write home about.  I would strongly suggest checking this place out for a drink, not so much for dinner."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place in Madison. I absolutely love their gluten free selection of beer, mead, and cider. Their food is consistent and such a great value. We always get their fries with the tiger sauce and the door county cherry salad. Sit at the bar and have the time of your life! It's a staple in Madison and I just feel lucky to be able to experience it."}
{"text":"Hubs loved his cheese curds and burger. I loved the chili spaghetti. When you go definitely get some cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Great fried cheese curds and beers specials! Great daily specials and beer selection."}
{"text":"So, you thought you'd try Heritage Tavern but you don't want to spend $40 a person? Go right around the corner to a Madison institution to The Old Fashioned and make sure you order their synonymous drink or one of the specialty versions they offer. The cheese curds are among the best in the city (I personally prefer the curds at Essenhaus but that's just me) and are not to be missed. Get a double order right off the bat!  You can't go wrong with an order of the Fish & Chips, the Old Fashioned Burger, or the really tasty Grilled Cheese sandwich. The mac & cheese is also a delicious coronary waiting to happen.  You don't go to the Old Fashioned to eat light - you go for the comfort food and the incredible beer selection. There's a great bar and lots of seating (a lot of corner booths) so this is a great spot for larger groups.   Use the Bartell Theatre next door as an excuse to get out and make the Old Fashioned your before, after, and if it's a crappy show- during, performance drinking and eating spot."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not incredible either. We came here with company that spanned two tables and we could barely squeeze ourselves in. We had to hunt for a spare chair, which in my opinion, tooked too long. My other complaint was that their so called fried cheese curds were the worst I ever tasted...too greasy, not flavorful, and served with blue cheese dressing (gross).  Granted, the Walleye sandwich was tasty. It honestly was so big that it nearly provided \"a wall\" for my plate. I got major props for finishing it and filled me up just so! Whatever the salad dressing was, I enjoyed it because it was light - yet not vinegarette which I despise. In addition, I tried their fallen apple cider brewed on the premises and it was a nice thirst quencher. I would return, but I wasn't blown away. Too bad this restaurant is always packed!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Excellent service by all the bartenders.  We were waited on right away in this busy place.  Excellent beer selections andthe bartenders make a mean old fashioned.   Our food (the fish fry and the pork shoulder sandwich) were both very tasty.  Makes me sad that I don't live near Madison."}
{"text":"Quintessential Madison restaurant. If you're from out of town, I suggest you go here for drinks and cheese curds.  They also have a great brunch. Their dinner menu is okay. I've been there many times and really think the best thing on the menu is the cheese curds.  Note that wait times can go as long as two hours for a table on Friday and Saturday nights. They do not take reservations so make sure you plan for a long wait."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, Wisconsin at its best! If you want delicious not overly greasy cheese curds please come here ! The beer is place has a great Wisconsin burger and steak sandwich ! Two thumbs up along the way around !"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Spotted Cow and some cheese curds. I am now in a greasy-fingered Wisconsin coma. Go Badgers!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Great service and great food! I ordered the deep fried cheese curds to start off with and oh. My. Gawd. Amazing. I wish I lived in Madison so I could eat them every week. The ambiance of the restaurant was super fun and quaint. I ate in the breakfast part. The display behind the bar showcased beers and beer signs from all over Wisconsin. Highly recommend you go!"}
{"text":"Please go here!  Great selection of beer, mixed drinks strong, and their old fashions are made at the bar every minute.  I had all of them.  Cheese curds are great, but hey I was in Wisconsin.  Cheese platter was on point.  The chips were great thing to snack on while drinking everything on the drink menu.  Get the old fashion beer, come on $3, for a good beer, I'm sold.  I had the old fashioned burger and it was also amazing, should of just gotten fries because it's an extra $3 for the side of cheese curds.  As you can probably tell, I was here for a long long time.  If I had time to kill all day I would have stayed there from afternoon to close."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat and/or drink anytime of the day downtown on the square.  I recently discovered they have an awesome breakfast menu and they open early at 7:30.  I lunch there frequently and always find the wait staff to be organized, helpful and courteous.  Great beer selection and not as noisy as some downtown bars can be.  Some of my favorite things to eat there are the fish fry on Fridays, cheese curds (of course!)  I have always had a good meal there!"}
{"text":"As my plane landed, I asked the person seated next to me for a lunch recommendation, and he suggested The Old Fashioned. I'm so glad I experienced it. An old tavern on the square of the state capitol, it was busy, but service was great. I had the Wisconsin Bratwurst Benedict. Thank goodness the waitress pointed out I could get a half order because that was plenty!  The flavorful brat patty on an English muffin was topped with an over-easy egg, lightly covered with a seed mustard, which added a great kick. The rosemary potatoes are lightly breaded and perfectly seasoned for my taste. I also appreciated that the hostess seated me at a table by the front window, where I could people-watch with the farmers market across the street. Very nice to have a view when dining alone."}
{"text":"You can't beat this place. Absolutely delicious food, very reasonably priced, amazing beers (usually the beer of the month is great and cheap). My favorite is, of course, the Old Fashioned burger. Cheese curds are fabulous. They have a good brunch too. What more can a Wisconsin girl ask for?  Not good for larger groups, and there's almost always a wait. I once waited 1.5 hours (but that's how much I wanted to eat there). And unfortunately, no reservations."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Burger with over-easy egg on top plus bacon is ridiculously delicious.  Plus, wonderful atmosphere.  I would come here for dinner every weekend if I could."}
{"text":"Simply one of Madison's best and a classic! Cheese curds are top 3 in the city. I always have to talk myself out of ordering one of my two staples: the summer sausage sandwich or the basic salad of greens, candied walnuts, and the yummy dressing (this salad is huge!). TOF is great for groups or a late night, last minute meet up. They even have karaoke once a week."}
{"text":"Great breakfast !! The market price on eggs and meat is a bit frightening..but ended up not bad..corned beef hash excellent not out of the can  granola very fresh and rosemary potato's yum ! Chocolate milk super, veggie juice thick and tasty."}
{"text":"So it's taken me a long time to write this review because I wasn't sure if I was lit or if The Old Fashioned really was that good. Problem is, I'm only lit while in WI so I'm going to have to just go with \"it's really that awesome\" and you're going to have to fact check whilst sober for me, ok?  Anyway, we ended up at The Old Fashioned for dinner because I decided I needed to have a steak for dinner but I wasn't about to go get all fancy to do so. Enter The Old Fashioned. It's got my steak, but it's served with fries and toast to keep it real. And let's talk about that toast for a hot minute here.   That was the best toast I have ever had in my entire life. I bet you thought to yourself, \"Toast is toast. It's all the same.\" WRONG. I literally, and I mean LITERALLY, talked about the toast the entire rest of dinner. I had a text conversation about toast with my sister. I imitated Nacho Libre over and over and over. I was just really impressed with the toast. I kid you not. The steak, fries, drink list, service, and everything else you can imagine were good too. I promise. That toast, though? I don't know, man. I think I'd drive back to Madison just for that.   I'll be meeting you again in your quarters for some toast, Old Fashioned. And if it doesn't come with my meal, I WILL be asking for it. Hope that's cool."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and a bloody and it was really good. The cheese curds are excellent. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. It wasn't busy so we received our food in a timely manner and it was just as ordered. I'll visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"Across the street from the Capitol with great food and a wonderful atmosphere! Highly recommend you check out this Madison staple!"}
{"text":"First time to Wisconsin, recommended by shuttle driver, thought it would nice to try it out as I had flown in and was starving. Airplane pretzels only keep you full for so long...   Ordered the House burger with a locally brewed cider- probably one of the best burgers I have ever had. Eat bite packed a flavor punch. I might have to come back before I leave. Great and fast service. Deeeeelicious. What a gem!"}
{"text":"I've been to The Old Fashioned a couple of times and I really love it!Once after the farmers market at the capitol and more recently last weekend for date night. The Old Fashioned is a wonderful showcase of everything local to Wisconsin. It would be a great place to take someone from out of town. They have an extensive beer list which I appreciate and obviously a nice selection of old fashioned drinks. I'm not a liquor drinker normally but my boyfriend likes the old fashions here. I had the #19 salad and added salmon. I'm glad I did because without a meat the salad would have been pretty plain. It was about 85% mixed greens (which were soooooo good) onions, a deviled egg (nice touch), and an awesome warm bacon dressing. Really yummy! Everything on the menu is incredibly reasonable price wise especially when you consider the quality of the food. The beers are around $4 (they always have a $2.50 special - mine was Kiss the Lips IPA, Lake Louie Brewing Co) and the Old Fashions were $5-$7 unless you wanted to get really fancy. Most of the menu items are under $10 but they always have a special which is more expensive but well worth it. Be prepared to wait at the bar for a table. Both times Ive been here was during peak hours and we waited well over an hour so pack a granola bar in your purse or order some cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Well worth the 5 hour drive !!  Are here last year during the Art on the Square and had to come back. Love the orange old fashion and the pickled lazy Susan is great !  Will come back every year !"}
{"text":"Solid food, solid service, a wide selection of local beers, and reasonable prices. The \"spicey burger\" comes with a side dish of jalopeños so you can heat it up to your taste. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Always have good food and very reasonable prices. We went with a party of 13. Had a very nice time. Worst part is they are always so busy. Never anywhere to sit and standing you are in the way.  Just plan on extra time.  That being said we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's no wonder they don't take reservations, this place is usually quite busy. Their food is great, and they have HUGE portions. Their multiple types of old fashions are all great, and their cheese curds are amazing (get them with the tiger sauce). Definitely the #1 place I go to show newcomers the Madison experience."}
{"text":"what a great place, true Wisconsin supper club, not to mention great old fashioneds.  Great atmosphere and the walleye is great.  You will have to wait but it is worth it.  Great prices too."}
{"text":"First order of business while visiting Madsion- down some cheese curds! The Old Fashioned came highly recommend from a local we spoke with and hotel staff. Sure enough due to it's infamous popularity we were faced with an hour wait but we quickly found bar seating. Known for it's array of old fashions, we didn't order any, but viewed the cocktails being crafted by the mixologist. I had the BLT sandwich and cheese curds. Cheese curds def lived up to the praises. Fried, crispy and gooey. A treat for the soul. BLT was well above average. Probably the juiciest tomatoes I've ever eaten. Tomatoes were dripping all over the place and it was topped off with high quality bacon! Prime rib sandwich was equally enjoyed by my fellow diner. In the evening, a Supper Club menu is offered. Now I fully understand why the The Old Fashioned is long standing! Yum!"}
{"text":"Solid food. Best beer selection in town. Awesome cheese curds."}
{"text":"Disappointment.  I've heard so many good things but none of it was true.  The restaurant was nice with solid wood furnishings, but this shouldn't be the only highlight.  The service on a weekday afternoon was lacking.  We were seated and then told that we had to order at the bar. I do not like getting up after I'm seated, especially for something I pay to get: service.  I ordered a burger and a side of fries and some fried cheese curds to share.    Cheese curds: they were not completely fried. They were soggy with oil and not gooey.  Burger: it was not hot.  It was dry and not juicy.  Even the bun was dry.   Side salad: The greens were wilted and drowned in salad dressing. All I could taste was strong pepper and salt.  BOO!!!!!!!!  And I read on their outside menu that Monday were buy one get one free burger but this was not true. LAME."}
{"text":"I think the mac and cheese is their best dish.  Get it with the bologna.  Good comfort food.  Their cheese plate looked good and their onion rings are great if you like heaps of the thin cut type (which I do).    The perch is my favorite of the fish selections.  I had that tonight while there.  Ordered a bowl of the beer cheese soup, too.  Somewhat flavorless and they garnished it with popcorn.  Bleh.  The rest of the menu is passable.  They try too hard for down-home Wisconsin cooking.  Whatever that is."}
{"text":"This place is like a legend as we heard about it in Milwaukee and it was recommended to us separately by a few other folks.   Two friends and I dropped in for drinks and what turned out to be a late dinner.  Service was ok (not great, not bad)...but the \"old fashioned\" drink was the best my friend had ever had and I loved the cheese curds!  Mac and cheese was a little disappointing, but the burger and grilled cheese rounded the order out.  Fun environment.  Youngish (20-30's) crowd.  A MUST stop for an \"old fashioned\"."}
{"text":"Great Wisco bar.  Tons of Wisco beers on tap of all flavors; excellent food (try the three cheese spread platter of one of the awesome lazy susans with cheeses, meats and relishes/pickles); and freindly and good servers/bartenders."}
{"text":"Cheese curds, Bloody Mary's, Old Fashioned's, Burgers...If these are what you're looking for, I highly recommend this place. The cheese curds are excellent, beer battered, and fried perfectly. Blood Mary's are like a breakfast in a jar with a pickled egg, big piece of jerky, cheese curd, etc. The Old Fashioned isn't too sweet. Burgers, like the Wisconsin burger are great. The cheese plates leave a bit to be desired, and are a bit on the pricey side, so start with something else if you want a starter. Service is a bit slow, and you have to flag down a bartender, even if you're sitting at the bar, and right in front of them. It's like they aren't in tune with what their guests are there for. It's not a place I'll frequent, but when friends are in town, I'll take them for the \"Wisconsin Experience.\""}
{"text":"AMAZING! I'm in Madison for just a few days and this place was highly recommended for everything and it didn't disappoint. Being a SF native currently living in NYC, I was shocked at how affordable everything is! Definitely get your $'s worth here.   We started with 4 snits. The number of craft beers on tap is a bit overwhelming but the snits (flights of 3 oz samples) is pretty perfect for being able to try lots of things. The chocolate stout was great as were some of the red ales and lagers. Snits come in orders of 4,8,12 and they are only $1 for each.  We then shared a plate of cheese curds...seriously the best thing ever and by far the best curds I've ever had. The Tiger Blue dipping sauce will change.your.life. If you do one thing in Madison, go to Old Fashioned and eat cheese curds.  I had the spicy burger and it was divine! Among the top 5 burgers I've ever had in my life. There's pepper jack cheese and jalapenos on the burger but it's not overly adorned. The meat is grass-fed and juicy...cooked perfectly.   I had a bite of a friend's apple pie to end the meal and will definitely eat here again before we leave (we have 3 more days here).   One thing I was impressed by is how much of a loco-vore town Madison is. It doesn't come off as pretentious either but it's just a matter of fact that the restaurants here take their food seriously and everything from the eggs to the beef to the cheese are local/organic/free range/grass-fed. The quality makes a huge difference (Old Fashioned even makes their own ice cream!).  5 Stars!!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food! Got super crowded as soon as we ordered and once we got our food we could totally understand why! The fried cheese curds blew my mind with deliciousness!!! Highly recommend this place. Will for sure be back on our next trip to Madison! It was perfect and the service was great."}
{"text":"A few locals recommended this place so I checked it out. They said to order the burger and I did. WOW!! Delicious! And the bartender recommended I upgrade to the cheese curds. They were amazing!!! Everything was very good and the service was quality as well. Definitely a place to visit if you're in Madison!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a stop for anyone visiting the downtown area. Great food and atmosphere that seems to capture true Madison spirit. Also, great price for HUGE portions.   Items I would recommend! - (1) cheese curds seem to be the obvious favorite. My sister tried about a dozen places in town and claimed this to be among the best, especially for the price (2) old fashioned house burger (3) prime rib sandwich  The following were alright - (1) pork shoulder sandwich - not bad but it was a little dry for my taste and I thought it could definitely use more sauce and relish. (2) Norwegian salmon salad - huge heap of salad was great but the salmon was definitely overcooked  Service was wonderful! Everyone seemed to work as a team and staff were friendly despite a busy night."}
{"text":"Cheese curds are the best I've ever had. The #29 burger is great as well. Huge beer and liquor selection. Always a long wait and is loud but worth it."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Old Fashioneds, you need to check this place out. If you're not a fan, you need to come here to see what you're missing!! Love the variety of Old Fashioneds you can order. Went with a group of 4 and we all had a different version. It was fun to try everyone's and see the differences. We had the cheese curds and they were pretty great.  One problem would have to be seating and the influx of diners. When we got there, we were seated immediately but after our arrival, 5 other parties were waiting and were jammed into the entrance of the restaurant. People waiting were jammed against the tables of people that were eating which made for a few uncomfortable encounters. It's better to go on non-peak hours so you're not waiting and also so you don't have someone leaning on your chair while you're trying to drink your Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service and good beer selections. Definately worth the waits for brunch on weekends!"}
{"text":"Just had the cheese curds. Living in Wisconsin, I have tried several but these would have to rate at the top. Light & fluffy goodness with awesome spicy dipping sauce. YUM!"}
{"text":"Me and the fellas stopped here after visiting the town while traveling through and stopped here for a little bar action during the Badgers game.  Setting was nice enough, plenty of space, but oddly only one small TV in the second bar area which was enough but not ideal.  Had the cheese curds which were off the charts delicious.  If I lived local I would have an addiction problem with these things.  I will say that the rest of the menu was seemingly what I would describe as old world.  Definitely an acquired taste for a huge portion of the menu.  I'm talking exotic forcemeat, odd fish items, exotic cheeses and such.  I'm sure they do a great job but just browsing the menu didn't make me want to full-on dine here.  Bar service was adequate, maybe a little on the slow side, but for the cheese curds alone I am a fan of this joint."}
{"text":"I'm not really a vegetable person but their NO.20 salad ROCKS!!!! I'll go for it again soon."}
{"text":"One of the best old fashioned drinks in the city along with an incredible order of cheese curds-can you get more Wisconsin than this??? Yep- they also have bratwurst!!!  Not only this but there is an amazing selection of Wisconsin beers to boot!  Looking for something a bit lighter- I love the Door County Cherry salad with chicken... so good!"}
{"text":"Good bar food.  It is, what it is.    A brewery with decent , dependable food.  Moderately priced and in good locations."}
{"text":"Coming to Madison from Chicago, I figured I'd find a good burger spot. This place delivered. Plus they have $9 pitchers of beer! That's pretty awesome in my book. The service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions good prices! Loved this place"}
{"text":"Burgers & cheese curds were fantastic! The Tiger Sauce (with horseradish) on the burger made it even more awesome! Upbeat & friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's funny how things happen.   We were just in Madison for the afternoon and evening on our way up to our family camping experience in Northern Wisconsin, so we wanted to find some fun things to do in a short amount of time.   During a stop to another great local business - the Chocolaterian Cafe - I picked up a magazine which featured a story on the owner of The Old Fashioned and it hit a nerve.   Being the (somewhat) savvy Yelper, I did check the reviews first, and it did live up to expectations.    Located in the heart of the Capitol Square, we found the restaurant easily and I was  impressed instantly with the service.   My daughter put our names in and she was treated with respect by the host.  Nice touch.    After a reasonable wait, we arrived at our table and made our selections.   For the beer fan in your group, there is a sizable selection of local options from all over the great state of Wisconsin.   I went with the Fatty Boombalatty from the folks at Furthermore - that's could be the subject of a separate review, of course.   Cheese curds.  Yep.   Homemade - fresh - beer battered and so delicious they just couldn't be good for you.   A treat like no other.   They are the benchmark to which all other appetizers should be measured.   I think if you put an order of mozzarella sticks next to these little nuggets of goodness, they would first become sentient beings...and then begin to cry knowing that they would never measure up as a side dish.    As for my main dish, I ordered the vegetarian option:  the grilled eggplant with portabella mushroom, roasted red peppers & zucchini and my new favorite - goat cheese.  It was like nothing I've ever tasted before.  Just the right balance of complimentary tastes.   Humbling, knowing that to try to replicate it would be a challenge.   Many happy returns, Old Fashioned.   Another example of a local business providing excellent food and equally outstanding service."}
{"text":"We had another place in mind but when we walked by we noticed it was packed solid. I was pleasantly surprised to walk in and find that it was a classic place, sort of like the name implied. We sat at the bar and I immediately noticed all the beers came from Wisconsin, period! How cool is that! Not being in Wisconsin for a while, I was leaning towards getting some cheese curds and brats. Instead, I found myself sipping on some Sassy Cow Chocolate Milk, which is probably about as amazing as amazing gets!  I couldn't resist the idea of fish n chips when the bartender told us they had walleye and perch. Sold! I got that on a bed of curds and I was set. Absolutely amazing and some of the best I've had in a long, long time!! No disappointment here.   It was cool to reminisce looking at all the old Schlitz signs and they even had the beer on tap! Whoa! I just loved the feel of the place, everyone was so nice, and, of course, the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place opened a few years back while I was making my exodus from the Madison area and then from the country. While making the occasional visit to family over the past couple years, I'd heard good things. And being back in WI for a few months, I thought it was time to check it out.  The other reviews are spot-on: this place is great. Although a bit fancy-looking to really live up to its supper club heritage, the food is absolutely great. Even my Scottish fiance was enamoured.  Great food (try the beer cheese soup!), an amazing beverage selection, and very attentive & friendly service.   We're recommending this place to friends coming to town for our wedding. Especially the foreigners - it'll give them an amazing taste of the best state. :)"}
{"text":"Must stop when in Madison. Awesome local beer selection and of course the best Old Fashions Iv ever had.  The thing to order is the Old Fashioned Burger with one if their many drink selections."}
{"text":"I'm a filthy worthless tourist, but I thought this place was incredible. The bartender was amazing. I'm basically a drooling idiot when it comes to beer, so I asked him to give me a flight of whatever he would recommend. I asked him not to give me any IPAs, and he looked me in my face and said \"No.\" Then he poured my flight and took the time out to explain every beer including where it was from, the local history, and what I was supposed to be tasting. It was unsolicited and TOTALLY AWESOME. This selection included an IPA that made me totally rethink my stance on IPAs.   The food was also great. I'm a gourmet burger hound and this one is in my all-time top 10. I could not get enough of the fried cheese curds, and they were still great several hours later when I was sleeping in my car in the woods."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers and the food is great too. If I wanted to have a conversation with friends, I would try and arrange to go during an off time, as 11:30 to 1 pm and 5 until late, every table is taken or spoken for and it is LOUD!!"}
{"text":"Best.  Mac.  And. Cheese.  EVER. No need to add bologna."}
{"text":"The food is very very bland.  I ordered the Fried Walleye Sandwich and the Cheese Curds.  Not great.  The fish was fried very well but had no flavor.  There was cole slaw in the sandwich to balance it out, but it needed more acid to balance out the greasiness of the sandwich.  Tthe cheese curds were ok.  The garlic aoli sauce that came with it was underwhelming and didn't complement the cheese curds well.  The best part of this restaurant was the nice view of the Capitol building.  The service was also very average."}
{"text":"The Good: beer and food selection, menu prices overall, cheese curd appetizer  The Bad: house burger was just ok, bloody marys were a house \"veg mix\" that tasted like clamato and horseradish/cocktail sauce - personally did not care for"}
{"text":"They make Old Fashioneds with brandy-weird. The Old Fashioned is, in that way, rather fundamental in its menu choices. Serving only Wisconsin made drinks and classic dishes from the area like Cheese Curds, Trout and Walleye, bratwursts and burgers it is Wisconsin culture and food in a  Capital neighborhood sized package. I loved the number 41: Wood-grilled and slow roasted pork shoulder. A tender and well spiced roast pork shoulder between buns with pickles and muenster, like a pulled pork with a mustard spice about it. The Curds are soft but slightly chewy to that squeak I'm told they aspire to. The lazy Susan platters are truly appetizers for a crowd. Try anything, the 11 diner table I was part of ordered nothing I wouldn't try again. Don't forget the nightly specials, they run the gamut from fish fries to prodigious prime rib."}
{"text":"If you ever make it to Madison, you gotta check out this spot. Right on the capital - if you can sit outside in the summertime, even better.   I will advise that this place is ALWAYS packed. If you think that you're going to walk up to this place during normal lunch and dinner hours and just get seated, your kidding yourself. That being said, they did just expand into the spot that L'Etoile used to be, so it's probably not as bad as it used to be.   Still, this place is RE-DIK-U-LUS. You can't beat the burger unless you head east to the Caribou. Melt in your mouth.   The bloody mary is also solid if your working on your hangover.   Outside of that, keep it up Madison. For a small city, the food joints can hang."}
{"text":"I've now been to The Old Fashioned twice. I know this is a Madison staple and a big deal. I'd hate to say it, but I don't get the craze for it.  $1 Old Fashioneds once a year? Sure, why not.  Full price Old Fashioneds the remainder? I will pass. My wife and I, along with a friend, stopped by and we ordered three different Old Fashioneds. They were \"okay.\" We weren't blown away by the namesake cocktail and they really weren't all that good no matter where they came from.   The menu is creative, but either we had a less skilled bartender or the quality just isn't there.  There are a lot of better bars or or near the square. Try Cask & Ale or Merchant.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"The beer menu here is no less than 5 pages long. Enough said. I cannot actually vouch for their burgers because by the time I receive my burger, I am always too drunk to objectively judge it as anything other than \"the best goddamn thing I have ever eaten in my entire life.\" The onion strings do make for an unrivaled burger topping.  Do not come here on a Friday/Saturday night without a death wish. Reservations are not accepted, and wait times are sometimes upwards of 1-2 hours."}
{"text":"Take into account I am not from WI so I've never had fried cheese curds before but heard all the buzz so I had to try some.  Got the cheese curds with an ice cold root beer and it was perfection.  The cheese curds really are amazing.  They have a great cheesy, salty, flavor and it really paired well with my ice cold root beer.  I can see why everyone talks about them.    On a side note, I just don't understand how this can't be the fattest state in the nation with fried cheese everything here, greasy hamburgers loaded with cheese, dairy and ice cream everywhere and last but not least breweries EVERYWHERE.  The second I got home, it was exercise time to pay for being in this state.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This seemed like a nice local place to go. My friends took me here as a chance to taste some local fare.   Walk in and it is your typical bar/restaurant nothing fancy. I had some of the tap root beer to drink and I enjoyed that. For my meal I had the bratwurst; the sausage was delicious and had a nice grilled char to it that added to the flavor just how I like it. The only complaint I would have is that I got a double bratwurst and it came on a hamburger bun which isn't too conducive to eating effectively.  My friends had the ribs (Thursday's special) and they looked good; I didn't hear any complaints about them. They also had the fish sandwich, which so must say was a pretty hefty sandwich and something I would probably try next time.  All in all, a nice place in downtown Madison to go if you are visiting."}
{"text":"Hands down, best cheese curds in Madison!!!!!!!! The burgers are awesome (you must get it with an egg!), their fish fry is yummy, i heart their mac n'cheese, the brunch is amazing... I'm also in love with one of the milk stouts they carry, I think it's Veruca? omg... yummilicious. And the cherry bounce! The owner goes up to Door County and hand picks the cherry they use! It goes quickly so RUUUUUUN to the Old-Fashioned when you here that they've opened it. Bottom line- you just can't go wrong with pretty much anything they have on their food and drink menus =)  Ohhh but avoid Wednesday, i.e. karaoke night. ugh. My ears bleed every time I accidentally end up there on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"The food/drinks at the Old Fashioned deserves a bit better than the 2 stars I'm giving. The food would probably get 3.5 stars. It's got a good selection of your standard pub fare, and let's face it, who wouldn't love a burger with a fried egg on top. The cheese curds are what you'd expect from WI, fried goodness. Beware of the onion straws, they are delicious, but they give you such big portions and don't take the time to let the grease drain from them, it ends up making you want to throw up. So make sure you have someone to share these with, maybe more than one 'someone's would be even better. The drinks are ok. Not my favorite place to grab drinks, but if someone suggested to go there, I wouldn't object too much.  So, the reasons why this place lost stars for me. First off, I have no idea why this place is constantly packed. it's not that special, but hey, not everything has to make sense. But the wait time is not worth it in my opinion. When you finally get seated, things generally go pretty well for the rest of the evening. However, if you're here just for drinks, good luck. I swear, the bartenders ignore you on purpose! The last time I was there, my friends and I were empty glassed and staring, hoping to just even make eye contact with a bartender for about 15 minutes before anything happened!!! That is absolutely RIDICULOUS! We were right up on the bar, not standing behind other people waiting for drinks and it took 15 minutes for someone to just make EYE CONTACT with any of us! I don't care how great the food/drinks are at a place, waiting that long for just eye contact is unacceptable. Not to mention, nothing there has ever knocked my socks off. They are a nice establishment with a good selection of drinks and competently prepared food items. But the service could definitely use an upgrade."}
{"text":"Good food and beer. I like going here for celebrations or for brunch."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmarks forever. I got a tip from a friend saying they had brunch so I came here with my wife on Valentine's day.  First of all, it's a great location in Madison, right on Capitol Square with a great view of the Capitol Building. Parking is limited but there are plenty of garages near by. It also be crazy if there's an event going on (like the Farmer's market during the summer).  We had mimosa's which as a tip, you can order by the PITCHER. Jackpot! As a side, I order the Apple Fritter Puff...holy moly. This is only 1/4 of an Apple Fritter from Greenbush bakery, sliced in half, and sandwiched between is free whip cream. Seriously delicious.  For the main meal, I had the Country Fried Steak and my wife had a scrambler. Lemme tell you, come hungry because the portion sizes are massive! This was probably the best country fried steak I've ever had.  Overall, I would highly recommend the brunch. I'll have to come back for their regular food. I enjoyed the brunch, the atmosphere and the service!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the hostess discriminated against us in seating. As the only minorities in the restaurant, and what felt like all of madison, I didn't really appreciate her service. I wrote up the full story on my traveblog here: http://bit.ly/1vxQ2Vs"}
{"text":"Yummy and reasonable price! Been there twice , I ordered Walleye sandwich ( very very good !!) and grilled chicken sandwich ( very good 2). bread are all pan-fried with butter( kind of heavy, but really good.)  soft curd was OK. If u like mozzarella cheese, u would love soft curd.   its ice tea is very good. it has a scent of rasberry. I did not even add sugar, and I love it!! A beer called Rebuen something. My waiter recommend to me as a light beer. It does not taste light! but it certainly is good!"}
{"text":"I like The Old Fashioned for its atmosphere-Its busy, the servers are friendly and you can catch some good local conversation as well as meet people who are traveling through Madison.   My first visit was to just check it out and have a beer on the 4th of July. My second visit consisted of a beer and the Wisconsin Burger. Although the burgers are not huge, they are still pretty tasty. Buns are soft, buttered and fresh. Meat is thick and juicy-done just right to my medium well request. The fries are thin, which are not my favorite, but they were nice and hot.  The place has about 150 beers on tap AND serves the traditional Midwest cocktail: The Old Fashioned. They mash theirs by hand here so if you want to get a little entertainment while the bartender serves up your drink, this is the place to be.  The prices here are awesome too! $7.95 for my burger and $3 for the bottle of Miller Lite.    I heard the cheese curds were off the hook. This is for sure my go-to spot when I am down around the Capital Square!!"}
{"text":"I went to the Old Fashioned for lunch this week. I had heard good things about it from friends and it did not disappoint. There were a variety of sandwiches and salads on the menu as well as sides, cheese-boards, and a number of entrees for dinner. I had the prime-rib sandwich with onion strings and my dining partner had the reuben and salad. The portions are huge, the prices are reasonable, and the flavors were all delicious! One unusual thing about lunch, was after they seat you at your table, you go up to the bar to order. (Similar to an English Pub.) Runners bring your food to your table. Everything we ordered was cooked perfectly and delicious! I couldn't have asked for anything better. I highly recommend the Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"I think this is one of those rare occasions where the hype has been earned.  I will now list some things I adore about the Old Fashioned: The onion strings and dipping sauces, the salad with door county cherries and salmon, the Walleye Sandwich.  You know the kind of the place- you have a favorite dish or two, and occasionally their beckoning calls creep into your dreams.   The downside: CROWDED, difficult parking."}
{"text":"Everyone seems to be out their minds enamored with the Old Fashioned...  I liked it, just wasn't obsessed. The absolute best aspect was on Mondays, burgers were $5! Exactly what students needed! Though a bit far from the campus itself where I was at, great deal worth walking for."}
{"text":"I've been here countless of times, and this is the first time I'm actually writing a review.  The thing is, all my other times have been for drinks, and not their actual food.  Today was my first time actually eating at The Old Fashioned.  If I were to purely judge this place on their alcohol, they'd get a 5/5 automatically. If you throw in their food, I might have to start petitioning Yelp to add more stars on.  First things first. Their most famous drink, The Old Fashioned, is absolutely delicious. The fact that it comes in different varieties only makes it better. But don't worry, because if mixed drinks aren't your thing, they also have a wide selection of beer.   Now, time to move on to their food.  We started off with their Lazy Susan appetizer to share, which consisted of garlic salami, smoked trout, creamed herring, Dijon mustard, dill pickles, deviled egg, liverwurst (pork liver sausage), Brick spread, Sharp Cheddar spread and crackers & rye bread.   If that seems like a lot of food, it's because it is. Their cheddar spread and crackers were basically those lunch packs you used to get as a little kid, where you dip ritz crackers into the cheddar cheese sauce. Is this a good thing? Absolutely! Who didn't like lunchables?!   The garlic salami wasn't bad, but it didn't really stand out either. The smoked trout was flavored perfectly, without needing much sauce for additional taste. The creamed herring, on the other hand, was doused in delicious sauce that really brought out the fish's taste (just beware, it's really, really fishy though). The dill pickles were great, combining sweet with crunchy. The deviled eggs also delivered, providing the perfect egg to mayonnaise ratio. Oh and finally their liverwurst, which was my favorite part of the appetizer, was sooo good. Just be careful though, because liver is usually a hit or miss. I loved it, while my friends didn't nearly enjoy it as much as I did.   Now onto the entree. I ordered their spicy burger, which was probably the best burger I've had in Madison thus far. I got a side of green salad instead of their fries, and I think I made the right decision. The salad was actually quite tasty, as opposed to every other salad side-dish out there, which usually is completely devoid of taste. The sweet vinaigrette really made the salad shine. The burger itself was massive, topped with smoked bacon, pepperjack cheese, fried onions and jalapeno. The jalapeno is quite strong and might be overwhelming for some people, so I suggest taking it off if you can't handle the heat. Everything else about the burger, however, was made to perfection. I got mine medium rare, and this might have been the first time it actually came out the way I wanted. The patty was extremely juicy and tender, with the pepperjack cheese and onions adding some extra layer of flavor. Not to mention the bacon, which was smoked and fried just enough to provide the burger with enough of a different taste.   Ok well, I just noticed how long my review was becoming, so I'll stop here.  Long story short, 5/5 for The Old Fashioned!"}
{"text":"I would love to give the old fashioned 5 stars for its food but the price isn't the best. German American Wisconsinite is the best way to describe this food. Their burgers are pretty delicious and juicy I never had one that's bad the fries are pretty crispy the look of them reminds me of when you get a good batch of fries from McDonalds. The beer cheese soup is an adventure to try anybody that isn't from Wisconsin but likes cheese should really try it, just be sure to get lots of extra popcorn. They have a cheese board that is good too got over a wide variety of cheeses and really expresses Wisconsin cheese flavors. A lot of times while I'm waiting I'll order a beef jerky from the bar, the large piece of delicious salty smokey goodness for a little over a buck. Their cocktails are a lot better than some of the places around here and overall it's a good place to take a date just expect for there to be a wait especially at night. They have an upper floor that can be booked I believe but they don't often use it normally during their busy hours I've noticed and it leads me to really question why I've never been seated up there except maybe once or twice when it wasn't that busy. The old fashioned is name for the cocktail the old fashioned definitely recommended specialty. Despite its drawbacks I would say this is one of the top places to eat in Madison especially if someone's from out of town."}
{"text":"My daughter was DJ-ing for ESPN's Game Day in Madison, Wisconsin and starving after a long morning of entertaining the crowds.  We looked up \"The Old Fashioned\", found parking and waited an hour to get a table.  It was crowded!  We ordered and my daughter, who cannot eat cheese, ordered her sandwich specifically asking that cheese be omitted.  Service was extremely slow and we had to wait a very long time to get our food.  When she looked at her sandwich, it had CHEESE.  The waitress was kind enough to resubmit the order, but once again, it took a very long time to get it.  When she got the corrected \"version\", it had mayo, which she also can't eat. It  may have been her error in this case if it was noted in the description, which she didn't see.  Alas, it was a lost cause and we ended up just tossing it .... after I tasted it and found it rather unappealing.  She did get the creamy chicken soup , which, by the way, was fantastic."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life!  I love The Old Fashioned.  It is straight out of Father Knows Best, yet updated for modern tastes.   The interior decorating is classic '50's, down to the old Life Magazine ads on the walls.  The menu is full of old favorites, many of them updated.  I started with an Elderberry Old Fashioned, a delicious take on the traditional Wisconsin favorite.  For dinner I had the No. 65 - chicken and biscuits while my daughter had the No. 51 - mac and cheese with bacon.  Both meals were huge portions (and leftovers went home with us) and delicious.    I'm looking forward to my next visit to Madison to have lunch or dinner at The Old Fashioned!"}
{"text":"The \"best cheese curds in Madison\"are good, but I do think this whole thing is overhyped.  It doesn't help that the cheddar is dyed orange (why do companies still do this?), but it is a good snack to go with your beer when you're look for something superheavy.  I'm sure the Wisconsin weather helps with that a bit.  The Old-Fashioned borders the capital which makes it convenient, and the menu is very approachable emphasizing Wisconsin specialities.  It's pretty big so you probably won't have to wait long for a seat at their long bar or at a table.  I think the best part might be the build-your-own old fashioned menu.  I'm not usually one to order an old-fashioned, but I have to say that theirs were amazing."}
{"text":"Two words: CHEESE CURDS.  The Old Fashioned is probably my top meeting and date spot in downtown Madison.  That doesn't mean I don't go to other places, but this is a huge favorite. :)  Highly recommended, love the food, the atmosphere and of course, it's one of the best places in Wisconsin to introduce your non-Wisconsin friends and family to our cheese curd overlords."}
{"text":"I read about The Old Fashioned in Madison Originals, I think. Honestly, the beer selection alone instantly made me want to check this place out. First time I went, we started out with two orders of cheese curds (group of 5). There was a choice of ranch, smoked paprika, or garlic dips; we chose smoked paprika and garlic. The first one had great flavor; but the garlic one oddly tasted more lemony for some reason. Still good though. The cheese curds were perfect; easily my favorite I've had anywhere, hands down.I had the No. 29, which was a Spicy Burger topped with pepperjack, fried onions, jalapeno, bacon, and smoked paprika sauce, rare. I liked that the jalapenos weren't pickled, since that is the most common way I've had them in burgers. Way spicier and better flavor overall. Second time I had the No. 30 since my husband kept telling me how good it was. He was right. I admit, the idea of a fried egg in a burger has always put off but I don't regret trying it all! The garlic sauce really tops it off."}
{"text":"If you're looking for your typical American food, this is the place for it. I'm a healthy eater, so the heavy stuff is not much eye appealing. Although, their cheese curds were pretty good.  I would recommend this place for groups that are looking for a casual place to chill and catch up. The food overall was alright. Would I go back there again? Probably not, but I wouldn't say it was a bad experience."}
{"text":"From out of town for EPIC and first time in Madison. I was looking for a good place to grab a bite and a drink at the bar. Since I love Old Fashions, I thought I'd try this place as it was also highly reviews and recommended. The bar staff were very nice, welcoming and offered local suggestions on things to see and do. I got the house burger on a gluten free bun and it was divine! Big juice burger with perfectly cooked, chewy bacon, some kind of fantastic garlic sauce and a sunny side up egg. It was a downright tasty burger! And the gluten free bun is one of the best I've had. It had a nice texture that held together even when the juices from the burger were coming through. They have a variety of old fashions, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the choices, I asked the bartender what he recommended. He suggested the basic recipe.. it was one of the best old fashions I've ever had! To wrap it up, I got the check and was wowed... only $17!! I would have paid almost that for my cocktail or burger alone in Philly!! If you're in town and looking for a great place to go... GO!"}
{"text":"Our second night in Madison, after we'd passed The Old Fashioned several times, we decided to check them out for dinner.   We each started out with an Old Fashioned (so appropriate, right?) and one of the cheese plates. I'm a HUGE cheese lover, but I wasn't entirely impressed with the selection. The camembert was served cold, which doesn't do it justice at all. The other 2 were just fine, but nothing outstanding.  We also both ordered the Old Fashioned Burger. Seriously delicious stuff, but so incredibly messy! Make sure, if you can get your servers attention, that you ask for a few napkins. This is not first date food.   I would love to have tried a few other items on the menu, as everything looked fantastic, but alas, it was our last night in town. Next time, Old Fashioned!"}
{"text":"Went recently for breakfast on a Sunday.  We were going to go to Sophia's and then Marigold, both were totally packed.  Walked down to Old Fashioned and got seated right away.  Had one of the scramblers and it was awesome!  My son had the belgian waffle from the kids menu, which came with a bowl of fruit.  So good."}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently with my wife and 4 month old. The staff was very accommodating of our giant stroller and extremely friendly. We split the No. 7 and 8 for dinner and it was excellent -- great to get locally produced/inspired foods. The beer list is long and Wisconsin focused. All around a great experience!"}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review because I have worked in the restaurant industry for years and know how much they suck. This is not based on the food or atmosphere at all. Old fashioned has great food and is a really cool place to go to overall. The service though.....my god. I have sat at the bar a handful of times and the bartenders are friendly and fun. But the server staff is ridiculous. I went purely to dine there for the second time and had the same server in the bar area that I had the previous time (I was with a different group) and both times the group I was with felt uncomfortable and taken aback by her. I don't know her name because she never introduced herself I just saw the server number on the receipt 1102 I think...GIRL would it kill you to crack a smile?? Super cold personality and acts completely irritated that we had the audacity to walk into the restaurant. It was my friend's bachelorette party and I get it, it's annoying i hate acting excited for people I don't know as a server. But you just do it! At least say congratulations. Then just dropped our checks off and didn't say a word. Last time was exactly the same and she spilled water and didn't even say sorry just \"I'll bring a towel\" and then casually dropped it off in front of the person I was with for them to clean up. Wth. And it wasn't just her, another staff member dropped off the drinks (at least she smiled) and when a friend asked for a drink she said sorry I'm just dropping them off. No. You say \"oh sorry I'm not your server but what would you like I can let her know.\" I mean is there no training here or no emphasis on how to act as a server?? I wouldn't say I'll never be back because I do love the food and drinks but I will never recommend it as a dining experience to anyone."}
{"text":"If you're coming just for the cheese curds give this place 5 stars.  Otherwise this place is nothing special.  Cheese soup- very one toned, not much depth to the flavor. Got hard to eat after a few bites because it was monotonous (and I LOVE cheese) Old Fashioned Burger (signature)- very dense, was hard to eat it all and had to rip it apart at the end, not much flavor Grilled Cheese- fine, a little boring, could have made everything more evenly distributed  All in all I think there are better places to go. If it wasn't for the curds I'd probably give it 2 stars"}
{"text":"It's all right.   Easily found street parking in front of The Old Fashioned on a Wednesday afternoon.    We ordered the heart clogging fried cheese curds (Wisconsin staple) and hay stack onion fries as appetizers.   We shared a jalapeño burger(super spicy, I recommend you remove a few jalapeño slices off).   The fried perch and fries were ok.  Actually the fish wasn't crispy and rather limp. Not a fan.   Service was slow.   Our waiter disappeared, when I really needed a refill of my ice tea for my super spicy jalapeño burger.  He didn't come back for 15 minutes.   By that time my tongue was on fire. Ugh.  Conveniently located across the capital building, which is a great location.  However, when you're from out of town and need a bite after a city tour, you look to Yelp to guide you.   The 4+ rating really is misleading .I would  give this place a solid 3 star and would have preferred honest ratings from yelpers.  Popular places don't always mean good food and value."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Madison restaurants.  It's fairly cheap, got an outrageous beer selection, and has a few really excellent pub food choices.  The burgers and curds....out of control.  The let downs?  You're going to have to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated and they don't take reservations for small parties.  But you can just spend that time drinking at the bar!"}
{"text":"Great local beer selection, a decent burger, a few solid cheese items, and can't forget the delicious, perfectly fried cheese curds.  A bit dim inside and a little noisy, but not too bad. Attentive staff considering how busy the place is, and everything was very prompt despite the late hour."}
{"text":"Some people turn to chocolate, some to alcohol and drugs, when I find myself feeling a little low, I head straight to The Old fashioned- time to devour a House Burger! I think it's the bacon, garlic, cheddar, and the soft-cooked egg that speak to me the most.  Should I be concerned that meat and dairy are beckoning?  Maybe, but I'll be back.  Amy the waitress is very nice too."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned was the place we had to go to while in Madison. Overall its a a decent place to get cheese curds and an old fashioned. We split the fish fry dinner special for Friday night, not really all that special. Cole slaw was weird texture and no flavor, two of the three fish were fried to long, and the fries okay. Saw some people eating some burgers and salads that looked good. I would try something else next time. Just be sure to get the cheese curds and one of their signature drinks."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned House Burger is the second best burger I've ever had.  I'd like to comment on other food, but honestly I've never had a reason to try anything else (though I've heard good things).  Only downside is the number of people this place attracts on the weekends.  Its tough to get a table in under 30 minutes and there usually isn't a place to park yourself while you wait since the bar is typically full."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is one of my go - to dinner places in Madison, since it's always an exceptional meal at an affordable price. Staff is always very friendly and attentive, and the restaurant really gives off the home-y Wisconsin supper club vibe."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go in Wisconsin do not be intimidated by the fact that it's on the square. Great beer specials, they had two women for $2.50 today heirloom blt for a special with the fresh mozzarella was absolutely delicious. Best cheese curds and ranch around!"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. We were in Madison for the weekend, and a friend recommended it to me. And after my great experience, I recommend it to you yelpers.  Great beer selection and some very good food, in addition to a large variety of old fashioneds (the cocktail). It's a pretty large location, but it definitely gets busy fast on the weekends.  What we ordered: - Old Fashioned: Can't remember which variation of the old fashioned that I got, but I don't think it was the original. This was a strong one, which is what I really appreciate in a cocktail! - Fish Fry Friday item: This was the perfect portion of fish and chips for me (maybe a few fries left at the end). BIG fan; not too fishy and tasty fries. - The Old Fashioned House Burger: My friend said that this is one of his top 3 burgers. Ever. My boyfriend was not as impressed, even after choosing to add an egg. It was a good burger, but not mindblowing.  Great location - wonderful place to walk around afterwards to walk off that food baby. I suggest coming here before the dinner rush. We came around 4:30PM on a Friday and were seated right away with no issue. By the time we left, it was very busy.  The one thing that blew my mind was how cheap all of the craft beers were. Maxed out around $6 for a craft. Very impressive!"}
{"text":"My friends say these are the best fried cheese curds in Madison. It was my first time trying fried curds, but I have to say...they were incredible! We got the delish paprika dipping sauce. (Tip: eat the big curds first while they're hot, otherwise they get weird when they're cold.) It's a good thing that the lighting is so dim in here, and they come out with your entrees quickly, so you don't have to see the little pool of grease that your curds were soaking in....ignorance is bliss.  Went on a Monday and they have BOGO burgers a la carte. Random, but awesome! Tons of veggie options. They have other specials every night of the week. Great selection of beers on tap, most are $4 or less. I had a Downtown Brown and some cherry beer that tasted like cherry pop (I cannot remember the name, but it came served in a snifter). I just wanted a big straw to suck it down!  We snuck in just before the dinner crowd at 6:30, snagged a table, but after that, the place got packed! I would love to come back to this place. This week is a tribute to mac and cheese and I gotta say, I'm tempted to go back to get some...they really know how to do flavor pairings!"}
{"text":"delicious restaurant on the square - get your fried cheese curds, mac and cheese, and other fatty wisco classics all in one place.  if you want to pretend to be healthy, their salads are pretty decent too.  try the minnesota beer \"hot chocolate\" - dark beer with cocoa powder and chili powder.  spicy, tasty, and unique!"}
{"text":"Must start off with saying that I love their cheese curds. However, I'm here to write about their weekday breakfast. I've gone for breakfast twice and both times I have gotten the \"Huevos Rancheros.\" The dish consists of two over easy eggs atop beef chili and a tortilla. This also comes with delicious roasted potatoes. The eggs are topped off with two sauces. One is a red sauce and the other a green tomatillo sauce. Very flavorful and filling. By the way, the eggs I eat here always have a gigantic healthy looking yolk! Must be because they are organic! I definitely plan on returning yet again for this breakfast dish. Service is always great too. I never have to ask for a coffee refill because before I know it, the server is already at my table asking me if I would like more!"}
{"text":"This is a burger and fries place, but the amount of hype it gets makes it seem like you can trust the steak. Go for the atmosphere and treat the menu like you're at a greasy diner for a good experience."}
{"text":"Mmm. Where else can you get fried cheese curds, cheese beer soup, a spotted cow (beer) and a bratwurst sandwich all at once? Here! And that's what I got. Food was amazing. Just a warning if you get the cheese curds, they are so rich and filling you may not even feel like eating your entree. We came for a \"brunch\" around 11:30am, and I wasn't hungry again until 10pm. I'd come back in a heartbeat if I am ever here again."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to experience the Old Fashioned while in town for the IRONMAN Wisconsin. A woman standing near me heard me say \"I just have to try fried cheese curds while I'm here\" and she immediately turned around and replied \"the best are at Old Fashioned.\" So off we went to eat fried food while people outside were working out for the entire day.....  The beer selection is pretty good. I wish I could have tried more Wisconsin brews! BF got an old fashioned and said they lived up to the name. On to the cheese curds....SO GOOD!! I agree with previous reviews in that they are a bit greasy, but the size and flavor is perfect.   I also had the mac n' cheese which was amazing--really creamy, cheesy, and perfectly cooked pasta. The brats had good flavor, but didn't come out as hot as we would have liked. The #20 salad was perfectly dressed and delicious. I highly recommend you finish your meal at Old Fashioned off with root beer float, it's one of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"brunch only until 1PM on sunday and noon on Saturday?  is it just my spoiled Chicago self, or does that seem a little early to stop serving brunch?"}
{"text":"Food, beverages, prices, service.....all awesome!  Double brat with side salad was perfect.  Side of braunschweiger for $1.50 was so good. Would have been 5-stars but it is incredibly loud (wasn't even a busy time of day) but you can barely hear the person next to you it's so loud. This place is a must for anyone in Madison!"}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned was fine...I would say the food is average and the service is below average. We went on a Sunday afternoon, and it was decently full. I guess I say the service was bad because it was a long time before the waitress ever came to take our order. She seemed totally overloaded on tables, so shame on the restaurant for not staffing appropriately. Also, one of our dishes was forgotten, which at this price point, I find unacceptable.   What we liked:  -My husband loved his bratwurst. So he'd probably give this restaurant way more than three stars! We also both thought the Mac and cheese side was phenomenal!  -Variety of cheese plates. I got the #1 and they were all delicious, fresh, and made a great snack for the next couple of days!  Average:  -Decent Bloody Marys...nothing standout when you're in the Bloody Mary capital of the world! Some horseradish, but very well balanced.   -The entree salad. All of the salads looked good and had pretty minimal ingredients. The white whine vinaigrette was great, and overall, made for a fine salad: spinach, cheese, croutons, some nuts.  What annoyed me:  -The table next to us tried to order a standalone side of Mac in addition to a side salad. The waitress said that wasn't possible, so one lady had to order two entrees (one being a full salad) and add the Mac as her other entree side to share with her friend. This whole situation resulted in a ton of wasted food due to the multiple entrees ordered to get the additional sides. The whole thing was weird and convoluted, and I just don't like when restaurants are difficult. It's much more enjoyable when they can be flexible and cool!   Overall, nice spot, cool location, worth checking out for decent food and a gorgeous view."}
{"text":"Came in from out of town, in the mood for brunch. Had the daily special of a morel mushroom scramble with rosemary potatoes and toast with homemade jam. Everything was fabulous, the portions were extremely generous and the prices are very great for what you get. Definitely coming back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"YUM - the food was excellent, light and delicious, generous portions and beautifully plated. AAAH- the drinks were poured to perfection and our bartenders all worked to make a good presentation while serving a delicious cocktail or pour.  YAY - we stopped in during Art Fair on the Square and were pleasantly surprised to get seated immediately, to relax as long as we needed as we took shelter from the heat and the crowds to relax and enjoy our much needed drinks and savory lunch. We will definitely return and always recommend The Old Fashioned"}
{"text":"I had the bratwurst platter and a beer.  It was good but 4 stars seems a little overrated."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now on visits to Madison and each experience was awesome. Never that long of a wait, great location next to the capitol building, and a varied menu of 'wisconsin fare'.  Based on my limited exploration of the menu, I can confidently recommend the house burger and the brandy old fashioned.  The house burger has bacon, cheese, and an egg on it... so it was almost a guaranteed winner. Add a few adjectives in front of those ingredients (e.g. berkshire or aged) and you've got yourself a slamdunk dish.  The Old Fashioned's are surprisingly strong and sweet without being coyingly so, I had two and needed an afternoon nap. (an admission you probably shouldn't make around Wisconsin folk, they will judge your lack of alcohol tolerance as a sort of moral failing.)"}
{"text":"A beautiful place. Only Wisconsin beers on tap or in the fridge. And they have a lot. The food quality is great. Curds, onion rings soups are awesome. Had 80% of the menu and it has been great. Been Here 80 times. Not a place to watch s game unless you can get to the bar. Even then, the sound won't be on. Not a sports bar. Even so, I recommend so many out of the area peeps here."}
{"text":"Probably best cheese curds of my life. Everything else was just good to really good with a top shelf excellent beer and drink menu. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went there once for Trivia.  I found their drinks to be watered down and quite expensive.  My wife and I ordered some apps as well, and I was not impressed at all.  I don't see what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Wow, I was really not impressed with the food here. Maybe I made a mistake of coming here for lunch instead of dinner and for ordering a burger, because it was one of the worst burgers I've ever had. Interestingly enough, what it shares with the other terrible burgers I can recall is that they were all made from grass-fed beef. I thought that would taste better, not worse! The warm chips that come with the burger were pretty good, but they could have served a third of the amount and been fine. There's no way any human being could consume that much grease in one sitting.  Based on my experience I really don't understand the appeal of this place.  Visited: May 17, 2012"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service and ambiance. The Wisconsin burger was so flavorable. You can tell that it was good quality meat. The cheese curds with smoked paprika sauce, horseradish, and garlic sauce were also quite delectable. We also had the salad with beets and Gorgonzola- super yummy! I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Melty, gooey, amazing cheese curds. The lemonade bourbon slush was delicious. Burger and fries were simply delicious. I loved the pennant flags on the second floor. Great restaurant, I'll be back. Maybe the only thing would be to have a martini special. The next door restaurant had patrons drinking amazing looking martinis at the outdoor seating, and I had a craving walking in. But, the slush made me forget all about that craving ;) Thanks for the memories!!!"}
{"text":"If you are a Madison visitor, this is a must stop before you go.  After dinner a group of colleagues and I hit this bar to get, what else, an Old Fashioned Sweet and some CHEESE!!!!  The waiter was awesome and the drinks  were phenomenal.  Here's where it got a bit fun - think a cross between Fear Factor and Fraternity Hazing.  A senior leader at the company decided to test the meddle of the group and ordered the following (all out of a jar, mind you): -Turkey Gizzard -Pickled Egg -Ham Hock -Beef Jerkey -15 Year old cheddar -Weird other cheese -Cheese curds  Well the beef jerkey, curds, and 15 year old cheddar were outstanding.  As for my eating of the gizzard, hock, and others - let's just say this, I DESERVE A PROMOTION!    Definitely check this bar/restaurant out - good vibe, good drinks, and a good menu."}
{"text":"Such a great dining experience. Went to dinner with a friend. We got the Wisconsin cheese plate which was great but probably too large for only two people. I got the Walleye sandwich with fries which was FANTASTIC. I had trouble deciding on my entrée but was happy with my choice. I am excited to head back and explore the Old Fashioned's menu more!"}
{"text":"Let's get the reason why you're here- Deep fried cheese curds. They are perfect, with a crisp golden breading, and a deliciously melted center. If a mozzarella stick and a chicken nugget had a baby, this would be it.   The bratwurst was delicious, but not especially unique. I have had similar quality bratwursts elsewhere. The burger was incredibly flavorful, but needed a bit more structural support. I'd recommend a knife and fork."}
{"text":"As a New York transplant in Utah, I was suffering through a dry spell of good beer, a drought so perpetual I was beginning to accept it was no longer a drought but just the climate. So you can imagine my giddy anticipation to visit Madison, WI where finally, I could quench my thirst. Turns out, I had to visit only one bar: The Old Fashioned.   With 52 local beers on tap and 98 bottles available, this haven for beer lovers felt like home as soon as we walked in, so much so that we returned the following night. And as if their beer selection weren't enough, they also had Curtis, the most knowledgeable and skilled bartender ever. Flipping glasses with one hand and spearing cherries with the other, he had the expertise--and coordination--to explain the history, taste and ingredients of their best beers. He even let us sample a Sasquatch Stout mixed with ice cream! After we ordered a flight of eight beers and a few nitro stouts, he then made the most delicious recommendation (Peruvian Morning Stout)--it's as if Curtis knows us better than we know ourselves.  So thank you for the beergasm, Old Fashioned. I'll be thinking of you many a cold, lonely night back in Utah."}
{"text":"Came here for the cheese curds and lunch.  The cheese curds were good albeit slightly greasy.  My roasted vegetable sandwich was good, but didn't come with too much roasted vegetables.  I combined the toppings from the second side into the first and made a half sandwich with the right amount of roasted vegetables.    Solid restaurant that I would return too."}
{"text":"It's good but nothing amazing. I like that it's grass fed beef.  Some burgers make you sad that it's over and you feel bad afterwards for stuffing yourself, but here it's just I'm going to eat this since it's not awful and it's a burger. It didn't leave me wanting more. I haven't had anything other than the burgers.   Ambiance/service: They consistently have good service and it's a good place to get drinks. It will be very busy on the weekends and you'll have to wait. During weekday dinners, it's usually only busy if it's warm out.   Where to go instead:  My favorite all time burger and fries are from UW's Memorial Union and Union South. But I haven't had it in a couple years since I'm a vegetarian now. It still looks good though and everyone who eats it per my suggestion says it's great."}
{"text":"The menu has so much more potential beyond sandwiches and old fashioneds. Sit at the bar to avoid the wait and to get the best service."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. Very nice inside and a great atmosphere. We stopped in for drinks and dinner around 10pm on a Saturday and it didn't feel too crowded. The food was great. I had the Wisconsin burger and warm potato chips. Absolutely best chips I've ever had. My husband was in heaven eating his beer battered cheese curds as he is from Wisconsin and misses them dearly. The classic old fashioned is a must try drink as is their root beer! Great staff and great evening of fun."}
{"text":"I went to the Old Fashioned for a friend's birthday.  It's not some place I would have chosen, because it seemed kind of \"uppity\" I guess.  But I could not have been more wrong.  First of all, the beer selection is amazing and prices start at $1.50 for a can of Pabst Light (I do not recommend Pabst Light, unless you already water down your Pabst).  They had both great bottle and tap selections.  But the greatest thing was the cheeseburger.  I ordered a cheeseburger with pepperjack...and it was...scrumtrillescent.  The best burger I've ever had.  Juicy.  Flavorful.  Not greasy.  Made with local grassfed beef.  I savored that burger.  Savored the sh*t out of it.  And the price was very reasonable...I think it was like $7 for my burger and fries.  I hope to go back again!"}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned highlights some of my favorite Wisconsin things:  1. A Brandy Old Fashioned 2. Cheese Curds 3. Burgers with fried egg 4. Microbreweries  5. Walleye  1. For those of you who are sheltered and do not know what an Old Fashioned is let me divulge:  Place sugar, a slice of orange, a cherry, and bitters into a glass. Muddle this mixture so the sugar can dissolve. Add ice, brandy, and top off with a little seven. What you have is the most fantastic mature beverage. I have been drinking them since before I was 21, and yes my friends all call me an old lady for it.   The Old Fashioned does not disappoint with their beverages, and they soak the cherries in the brandy (a must). They stay true to Wisconsin with a menu full of meat and cheese (they recently added a hot dog menu).   2. Cheese curds... fresh curds dipped in homemade beer batter and deep fried to PERFECTION. Anyone visiting Wisconsin MUST MUST MUST have some. Note: Eat within the first 10 minutes of delivery to your table, they are the best when hot and fresh!   3. In Wisconsin we love meat, and cheese. A Cheeseburger isn't complete without more meat, specifically bacon, and if you are lucky, a fried egg. Don't knock it til you try it and be ready to make a mess. Soak up all that yolk with your bun, YUM  4. Capital Brewery and New Glarus are my favorite local microbreweries, I wish I could have spotted cow in San Francisco!  Their list is extensive and inexpensive   5. While I get plenty of great fresh and raw seafood in SF,  my heart will always lie with the lake fish and Walleye takes the cake. You can get the walleye sandwich, or my recommendation skip the bun and just eat the delish fillet! (and don't forget Friday night Fish Fry!!)    Even the woody smell reminds me of Wisconsin.   The Old Fashioned, where Wisconsin is king!"}
{"text":"I visited the Old Fashioned on Election Eve and it had a great atmosphere. My friend and I chose to grab seats at the bar for dinner and we engaged in great conversations with locals. We started off with beer fried cheese curds which which sinful. We then took advantage of the buy one get one free cheeseburger deal for Mondays. Everything was delicious, fast, and local meat!! Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Yes just yes  This has to be the ONE place you eat in Madison if you are only there for a short time. This place is the state of Wisconsin all in one compact package.   Since moving to this state I am of course on the search for the perfect cheese curd, and my friends I think I have found it. In addition to there yummy cheesy goodness they are offered with like 6 different dipping sauces, and I do like my sauces.   Their beer selection is fantastic and they even have a grilled summer sausage sandwich on the menu. I didn't even know that was a thing here! exciting times!   Be warned they do not take reservations, and because they are so awesome it can be busy so expect a wait during the usual times."}
{"text":"This place gets great reviews so my wife suggested we go here for lunch.  We arrived by walking and it was already pretty busy around 11:45 on a Friday.  A host seated us at one of those booth/table combo seats in the front window area.  We were handed menus and then asked if we had joined them for lunch before.  When we answered \"no\", it was then that we found out that they do some kind of half-ass table service for lunch.  The customer is expected to read the menu, and remember the number of the sandwich.  Then go up and stand in line by the bar cashier to order.  Oh and if you want a beer from their extensive list, then you also need to remember that, but that list is not on the menu they handed you at the table.  I saw a sign hanging with the list, but then a passing waitress noticed me reading it and handed me a beer menu saying that they weren't all listed on the sign.  There are numbers next to the beers, but don't bother remembering those, because the cashier was confused by them, explaining that they change all the time.  So we eventually ordered and paid.  (How do you determine a tip on a credit card when you haven't actually been served yet?)  My beer was handed to me at the bar.  For some reason, my wife's chosen beer was not immediately available and we were told it would be delivered to the table.  I wish mine had been as well.  The beers were served in ICE cold glasses.  This is NOT a good thing.  I had to wait forever for my beer to warm to drinking temperature.  So back at our table with a little number on a stick, we waited for our food.  It came out promptly and we dug in.  My turkey sandwich with onion strings was delicious.  My wife also enjoyed her grilled cheese with Swiss and cheddar and peppers.  Because it was a \"work\" day at lunch time, we appeared to be the only ones drinking beer at any of the tables that I could see.  Maybe the bizarre service style better accommodates the in and out lunch crowd.  After we finished our sandwiches, we sat and enjoyed our beer, but we felt no desire to extend our stay by going through the trouble of getting another beer.  Overall I wanted to like Old Fashioned.  The food was very good and the beer selection was an impressive list of Wisconsin breweries, some of which I had never heard of before. Unfortunately, the service was so disappointing that it sullied my opinion of this place.  I hope they are better at dinner time."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. I ate no 37 chicken breast bacon and cheese with cheese curds side I love it. I also tried the October fest beer that was amazing. Good and fast service."}
{"text":"After a recent dinner I am less enthused by the food.  Curds are good but the rest of the menu is extremely heavy and not very high quality.  Drinks, location, appetizers all nice but I will avoid it for an actual meal from now on."}
{"text":"**Update** Just another reason this place gets 5 stars, it is pup friendly!!! Me and the bf were looking for a place that wouldnt mind if we brought the pup to eat next to us outside and the Old Fashioned was extremely accomodating... they even bring out water dishes!!! Yay to the OF!  This is the place I bring people that are new in the area, or out for a birthday.  Great, great, diverse menu with WI/German grub. BEST fried cheese curds in the area and the best mac n cheese as well. There beer selection is truely amazing for someone looking to sample some good WI brews!  And every month they have a beer special running, with 2.50 pints and $9 pitchers (this month was stout)! Its also fun to sample their lazy susans! My friend swears by them!"}
{"text":"Get there early! But if you don't have reservations the wait is absolutely worth it. My gf and I stopped by with no reservations for dinner at around 5:15pm and the place was PACKED. We waited for about 20 minutes and were seated. The staff were very friendly and patient with us. We got beer and hamburgers. THEY WERE SO GOOD. I love eggs on my burgers and they nailed it. DELICIOUS DELICIOUS. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing cheese foods! I loved the mac/cheese with bacon here. It was gooey, cheesy, sharp, smooth, creamy, and salty. Provided the perfect base for the cheap beers and old fashioneds. The beer cheese soup and cheese curds are also not to be missed. Who needs vegetables anyway."}
{"text":"Just based upon the amount of reviews for this place, you know it has to be good. and i'm here to tell you it is! Definitely try and either make a reservation beforehand or come at an odd hour. If neither of those works for you, check out the bar for first come first serve seating. Its a full menu and you get to have some nice conversations with the bartenders!   Must gets! 1) Cheese Curds with Ranch 2) Spinach Salad with salmon  YUM! I also had the prime rib sandwich, which was good, but nothing too amazing. Their side tossed salad however, is to die for. I don't know what dressing they use, but it is refreshing and savory all at the same time.   As for drinks, you have to get an old fashioned at the old fashioned. Try and play around with your palette and also get it with Brandy!  This place is always busy and must for anyone visiting! on my list to try the next time is the Wahoo sandwich and Mac and Cheese!"}
{"text":"This is the \"go to\" Madison stop for locals and recommendation for out of towners. For me, it's just ok. Food is consistent but the atmosphere is loud. Go to say you've been and stop by one of the other GREAT Madison spots."}
{"text":"Lots of beers from Wisconsin available, but only one cider.  Food was OK; we were directed here from a cheese shop because they offered fried cheese curds.  Pretty hopping place!"}
{"text":"How do I love the Old Fashioned? Let me count the ways... The burgers kick so much ass, especially the one with the fried egg on top. I even really dig the jalapeño one as well. An absolutely perfect burger, not to be missed. An ever changing, evolving, extensive beer selection and not to mention the different varieties of old fashions. Cheese curds with tiger sauce, I mean come on. Its just a really great place to enjoy a real nice time."}
{"text":"Aaa yes the old fashioned. This place was highly unique. It had a ton of beer selections from the local breweries. I met some friends down there for drinks and dinner. The drinks were great and well priced. There was only one problem the dbz level was crazy. I really could not even hold a conversation across the table because it was so loud. We were there around 9pm on a friday night, did not help the matter."}
{"text":"You know how some bars have an odd assortment of appetizers for people to munch on?   Things like picked eggs, turkey gizzards, etc...  Things you might not eat if you hadn't just put a few beers down?  My buddy ordered the turkey gizzard one night.  Expecting a horrible slimy taste, it was actually a chewy, salty, a unique taste that can be described as similar to a strong chicken broth.  Then our friend brought some back to our house and tried to make our high-school aged babysitter eat them.  She won't babysit for us anymore.  True story.  Seriously, though.  This place is awesome.  The cheese curds are the best in Wisconsin.  I still haven't found a better draft beer selection in Madison.  That said, cheap PBR on tap?  Count me in.  I still haven't found a bad thing on the menu.    Only downside is unless you're an early bird special type, prepare for a wait.  This is where that huge draft beer selection plays in their favor.    There's not much else to say that other reviewers haven't said.  Other than you need to be here.  And eat turkey gizzard.  Just don't push your babysitter to eat them later."}
{"text":"I can vouch for the cheese curds, so wonderful when they are fresh, otherwise, much like other places' cheese curds, they become sluggy traps of oil and blah.  I trudged through my Old Fashioned even though I am a beer dude. It was strong and packed a helluva punch, but totally worth it. I first thought it was a Wisconsinan sangria.  Enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place has what may be one of the best burgers I've ever had!  I also had a sample of the Friday Fish Fry which was also really good! Atmosphere is very unpretentious and welcoming. I went there with my wife, her cousin and some of her cousin's friends. We all had a great time with great food. If I'm ever back in Madison I'm DEFINITELY stopping by here and next time I'm going to try the beer cheese soup, too."}
{"text":"Food is good. I am not sure I understand what the hype is all about. I am not a big meat eater - so my thoughts should be taken with a pinch/handful of salt."}
{"text":"Went here a while back while visiting my girlfriend, loved it, then came here again a different time. It seems like this place is always busy, but if you don't mind waiting a half hour or so, then you can partake in the awesomeness that is The Old Fashioned. The first time, during our wait we referenced a menu online and planned out what we were going to get, so that we could order immediately. Once we were seated we started off with some delicious cheese curds as an appetizer. After that, I had the old fashioned burger, which was awesome (except for the cold egg on top, but I'm pretty easy to satisfy). My girlfriend had a chicken sandwich with bacon, which she also loved. If that wasn't enough, both of our plates came with a ridiculous amount of fries (which were even good cold hours later).  The atmosphere is pretty fun. Very busy, with a bar and sports on the TVs. It was a little noisy because of how many people there are, but it didn't really bother us at all. In addition, the staff was very friendly both times, handling the constant flow of customers very well.   Probably my favorite restaurant in Madison. The Old Fashioned left us craving some of their food at all times on the rest of my visits. It's odd, over the course of writing this review I've gotten progressively hungrier...I wonder why."}
{"text":"I am heavily loving on Madison and The Old Fashioned just topped off my experience here!  My colleague and I had the cheese curds and of course a round of Old Fashioneds (duh!) and I tried the pork sandwich with beer cheese soup as my side.  It was alll soooooo good.  Especially that soup.  And those curds!  I had the horseradish dipping sauce, which went perfectly with it.    Ambiance is cute.  Service is beyond friendly.  So get this: I collect matchboxes everywhere I go.  They only had a plain matchbox, but the hostess MADE a special matchbox just for me with one of those plain matchboxes and a sticker with the restaurant's logo.  Doesn't get much more thoughtful and creative than that!  I really can't wait until I can come here again."}
{"text":"What to say about the Old Fashioned...  This is has been my favorite Madison spot for years. I was introduced to this restaurant by my dad when my brother went to Madison. From that very first experience here, I was hooked. I took my family here when they were in town for my graduation, spent countless nights here with friends eating piles and piles of cheese curds, drinking Moon Man and old fashioneds. So many great times here and the great times continued this past weekend when I went back to Madison for the Ohio State game.   Tried to come here on Friday night, but the wait was 2.5 hours...no thank you. You cannot make a reservation here, which is the only downside of this wonderful restaurant. You give them your name and # and they text you when your table is ready. The wait this time was only 30 min (Monday night). Usually I don't even mind waiting an hour because they have a good bar area where you can hang out and order drinks and apps (cheese curds here are the only option - best cheese curds I've ever had in my life to this day). Bold statement, I know.  We went to the bar while we waited and ordered an old fashioned right away. After a little while we got a text and seated at our table. Our server was awesome, super attentive and sweet. We of course started off with the cheese curds with ranch. 2 years later and still the best cheese curds EVER. For the main course, I had to order the Old Fashioned Burger (burger patty, fried onions, bacon, aged cheddar, garlic sauce, and a soft cooked egg on a roll). BEST. BURGER. EVER.   Well clearly I could go on forever but basically if you're in Madison, you need to check out The Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"We came here - as directed by, well, everyone we know - and couldn't have been happier with the choice. At the end of December - with no school in session - it was still PACKED! However, there was only a 20 minute wait for a table. (They text you when it's ready.) Walking through, we found a nice spot at the bar. So much for waiting!   We had THE Old Fashioned which was fantastic and a variety of local beers as recommended by the busy but very polite and helpful bartender. The deviled eggs were To. Die. For. The cheese curds were also good. But those deviled eggs.   We will be back next time we visit Madison."}
{"text":"I love this place mostly for the spicy pickled egg, other bar appetizers, and their beer specials. But the old fashioned burger is loved by my friends, and I have to agree it isn't too shabby."}
{"text":"The food at the Old Fashioned is very good - I haven't really been disappointed any time I've eaten here. The beer selection is fantastic, being one of the top pubs in the capitol area. The old fashioned cocktails they serve are very good, as well. Overall a fun place to eat.  However, the service leaves a lot to be desired, and the size of the establishment is much, much too small for the demand this place is constantly in. I don't think I've ever had a wait time that was less than 45 minutes, unless I want to have dinner at 3PM.  I understand that it is difficult to meet demand when you are as popular as this place... but seriously? Is it an image thing, to be so overbooked all the time? Why not open up a secondary location? It seems a waste to turn away as much business as this place must each night.  Pros - excellent food, excellent drink. Cons - small location, everyone crammed together, loud, noisy, slow service, and long wait times.  If the cons don't bug you, you'll have a great dinner. Otherwise, consider going somewhere else for your night on the town."}
{"text":"What can I say about The Old Fashioned that hasn't been said in the 571 other reviews?  Probably nothing.  But here are my thoughts...  The Old Fashioned opened in Madison a couple of years after I graduated from UW Madison and left for Chicago.  I'm pretty much bummed that I missed nine years of eating here.  I mean come ON.  52 Wisconsin beers on tap???  A new beer every week of the year!  (Maybe I should plan on this.)  Apple Pie made by a local FFA? Locally made items up and down the menu?  This place is awesome.  The cheese curds - pretty damn good. (Am I allowed to say \"damn\" on Yelp?)  Great flavor, not too greasy, perfectly fried.  Mac and Cheese - pretty good - not the best in Madison. I kind of consider myself a Mac and Cheese connoisseur.  This one had al dente noodles and rather runny, creamy sauce.  The flavor was good, but it just didn't meld together into a cohesive dish like I think Mac and Cheese should - iI know this sounds ridiculous - just go with it.  So yeah - tasted good, but definitely not my favorite.  Fish Fry - husband says, \"it was great\" - he is clearly a man of many words. ;)  After a little prompting, he added, \"the fish was light and perfectly fried.\" So there's that.  Now that I've moved back to the Madison area, I hope to visit The Old Fashioned often - I've got 52 beers with my name on them!  I realize that many other Yelpers say that The Old Fashioned is not as good as it used to be, but for this first-timer, it was a hit."}
{"text":"If you live near or in Madison, there is no way you have not heard of The Old Fashioned before. It's one of the most popular hangout and food places in the area and it's always on my list of restaurants to bring friends that visit from out of town to.  I love their specials and my favorite is the Monday special -- buy one burger, get one free. You could always share the second burger with a friend. Or if you're like me, you'd eat both of them and feel super stuffed.  My go-to items at The Old Fashioned are the Old Fashioned burger and the double bratwurst sandwich. The fried cheese curds here are to die for and if you go here, you cannot leave without having tried this Wisconsin delicacy. The dipping sauces add to its greatness.  Finally, be aware that reservations are not taken and that weekends require super long waits. It'll be worth it though if you have the time to spare."}
{"text":"Friday fish fry and cheese curds! GO NOW!  Large, large selection of craft beers in bottle. And good selection on tap, too.   My only complaint is that Friday is so crowded, I was irritated that people were bumping my arms. And, not to mention I felt as though I was in everyone's way. Our table wasn't ready and we were instructed to wait outside. In the f'n heat way, NO!  Check the second bar for seating while you wait for your table."}
{"text":"It pains me a bit to only give 3 stars, but my recent experiences here have been subpar on service. I used to love dining here. Food remains good as a place to take out of state friends who want the look and feel of an old supper club and to experience good, house made cheese curds.   My recent experiences have included curt, unfriendly and hurried bartenders and servers. I had my husband, parents, brother and nephew with me during my most recent visit. The waiter was very abrupt with us. For example, instead of asking how we'd like our burgers cooked, he just said \"cooked\" after each order was placed.  My mom was excited about the cheese soup with popcorn on top. When it arrived without the popcorn, she asked the waiter about it. His response was that the popcorn was absorbed by the soup. I've had this soup before, and my mom had already stirred up the soup looking for the popcorn. It clearly wasn't there, and, frankly, wouldn't have been a big deal if the waiter hadn't argued about it. After a brief exchange, he finally said he'd bring her a small side of popcorn she could use to garnish the soup.  Everything about his body language told me he couldn't wait to be finished with this shift, and I actually saw him walk out of the restaurant during our meal and his tables were taken over by someone else. When this has happened at other restaurants, the first server usually stops by our table to say there's been a shift change and introduces the person taking over. The second person was much more friendly, but took a long time to produce our check after we requested it.  There are a lot of great places to eat and drink in Madison, and after my recent experiences here, I'll take my out of town friends and family to other places in the future."}
{"text":"cheese curl, well fried, is pretty good with beer.  almost like biting into cheetos and the melted goodness come right out. lol."}
{"text":"Came here while vising Madison for Great Taste. We came for lunch, so it was hybrid waiter/counter service which was thoroughly explained to us. I don't generally care to tip before I eat my meal, but I'll try not to hold that against them.   They had an excellent beer menu. Ordered a local brew and they obviously have clean tap lines (a concern of mine with places with large draft lifts).  The food was tasty bar food- I had a steak sandwich with cheese curds and a side salad. Definitely go for the tiger sauce for the curds (horseradish based).  Overall: Great service, great bar, and good food."}
{"text":"Wow, love this place. The salad with dried cherries, blue cheese with a salmon filet on top was incredible. Other things I've had in the past was a chicken dish, cheese curds, and a burger. The beer selection is great, and I actually ordered a PBR with a spicy pickled egg in it that really worked.  For dessert, I had the huge chocolate chip cookie for a buck.....delicious.  Staff is always friendly and helpful, just a great vibe here all the time. The half hour or so wait on the weekends is well worth it. There's so many restaurants I love in the area, and this is now tops on my list."}
{"text":"I know they can't control the crowds but the restaurant stays constantly overcrowded and gas wait like 45 Minutes's on weekdays. Friends have tried on other days and report the same wait.   With that said they offer affordable prices and standard pub food. The highlight was the old fashioned sundae which was blended ice cream with brandy. It was STRONG for sure, but good."}
{"text":"Came here specifically for the cheese curds, but my family was not impressed.  Maybe it was an off-night for them, but we've had much better at some of the other locations in the surrounding blocks such as The Tipsy Cow."}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders. Huge Wisconsin beer selection. Great cheese plates and fried cheese curds. Pretty average old fashioned."}
{"text":"Best place for cheese curds and an old fashioned in Madison! This is a great place to bring friend and family visiting out of town, and hands down my favorite restaurant in Madison! The staff are always so friendly and helpful and the food is delicious. I always have to get the No.21 salad--the dressing is to die for."}
{"text":"I always love stopping here when I'm in Mad-town. Brunch, lunch, dinner, and drinks; they got it. Lots of great local flavor here with Wisconsin influences all over the menu. From brats to mac & cheese to piled high green salads to those tasty deep fried curds...there's a bit of something for everyone, and lots of local ingredients. And yes, they have fish fry! Like other reviewers have mentioned, there's an amazing drink selection here, including a super yummy root beer option (served in a frosty glass for good measure). Warm and inviting on the interior, quick and friendly service, right off the square...solid!"}
{"text":"After two visits, I can see why other Yelpers complain about the service.  My first experience was much better, but when I brought a couple of coworkers here the second time, we all agreed that we have had better food and MUCH better service elsewhere in Madison.  Yes, this place has a great location: just steps away from the State Capitol.  It is located in a historic building.  When we asked them to turn the AC down (mind you: it was December and snowing outside), our server told us it was actually not the AC making it cold, it was the windows we were seated next to.  I told her that I begged to differ because the cold windows don't blow napkins across the table (I then demonstrated to her several times) and she walked off.  We asked a busboy, a food runner and then a manager type guy about turning down/off the AC - all of whom said it couldn't be done, etc.  One guy said \"it makes it hot for the servers then\".  Nevermind that four guys were freezing and when our beer cheese soup was delivered, it instantly became cold.  The food both times has been good.  The aforementioned beer cheese soup is a bit tart (think swiss cheese), with a garnish of popcorn and a side of oyster crackers.    The cheese curds were good - not the best - but when in Wisconsin...  The second time I decided to try something different and had the Green Bay Chili - which is like Skyline Chili from Cincinnati ... only if haven't actually had Skyline Chili.  I would not order it again.  It was basically normal chili over a small amount of spaghetti.  Oh, and for some reason, they don't serve it with oyster crackers like they normally do in Cincinnati.  The drinks are what most people come here for.  Both visits, I have been here on a week night and it was packed (wait times of 20-30 minutes, and they don't take reservations).  Lots of Locals, and the crowd skews on the younger side.  If you are looking for a watering hole downtown, this is the place.  If you are looking for a good meal with good service (and not a snotty attitude), this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Cheese curds are super greasy and delicious and there's a great beer selection but when I went they double charged my credit card so make sure you check your statement. Our server was pretty awful too.  Otherwise I would give them four or five stars."}
{"text":"The wait was long and the whole restaurant was busy- even for lunch on a Friday. The food was okay. I was most excited to try the cheese curds as a substitute for fries but they were super greasy. Delicious, but I couldn't finish half of them."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always a wait situation and with so many excellent restaurants in Madison/Middleton we never wait. We planned to arrive at this restaurant between 2:00 pm and 3:00pm so we didn't have to wait and got there at a slow period on a Tuesday afternoon. Upon entering the restaurant no one greeted us right away, when the hostess did come around my husband asked for a booth. She gave us a small table for two right next to the hostess stand and where customers come in and wait around for their table. One of the worst tables in the entire restaurant when there were many empty tables. I don't like hostesses that don't know how to do a good job. We spoke up and said we didn't like that table and she moved us to another table, she was obviously annoyed with us. But who care? I'm the customer and I brought my wallet into this restaurant! You should always seat customers at the best tables FIRST. On the bright side, our waitress was pretty good, although I asked for salt on the rim of my margarita glass and it came with none. The food was very good. My husband ordered the Walleye sandwich and I had the House Hamburger. The table next to ours had a 4-5 year old child who was bouncing off the booth next to me, fell down, hit her head and stopped. The parents, of course, were not watching their child. They left shortly after that episode and we enjoyed our lunch. The food is good, drinks aren't watered down. If you can visit during the week between 2-3pm it's the best time to go to this restaurant.  Don't settle for a bad table."}
{"text":"We were in Madison when the Blackhawks were in the playoffs. Who knew that every bar in Madison did not have the hockey game on?! Well, everyone in Wisconsin knows that. It is Chicago folks do not. In any case, we found the Old Fashioned and they had the Hawks game on. We were lucky and got seats at the bar and did not have to wait for a table.  Solid beer list. I has a local Wisconsin beer. Someone in our group had an Old Fashioned and it was good.  Food was basic but good. Cheese curd appetizer was crazy good. Saturday night prime rib sandwich, burgers, chicken sandwiches all made for good choices.  Bartender was helpful, attentive and friendly. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Service is always on point. Best tomato soup in town (only served on Mondays!) great burgers, good hot dogs-for the price, can't be beat."}
{"text":"Overrated. Incredibly greasy and underwhelming. I've had multiple bad visits that included a walleye sandwich (No. 36) that was full of bones. Not just one or two bones, but FULL of bones. A complete choking hazard. I did email them and they did refund my meal, but it was still a terrible experience.  I usually end up going there only when other people insist. And recently it was as greasy and unsatisfying as ever. Even when you try and make one of the sandwiches healthy by skipping the bacon, it's still a greasy mess. Even the salads have bacon!   The beer selection is stellar and the service is usually fine. There are some great bartenders, but here are also a couple annoying ones. It's usually way too busy for what they offer, and wait times can be long.   The food will clog your arteries like no other, and there is often a wait for a table. There are plenty of other places in Madison that offer better food and a better experience."}
{"text":"Update: don't get the egg scramble special on the brunch menu. It just doesn't taste good.   I visited the Old Fashioned again with a few friends. It was pretty easy to get a table, and four of us ordered the same thing: the number 7, the daily special egg scramble. Three of us ordered the veggie version, with spinach. One of the plates was straight up cold. My plate, though warm, really lacked flavor. The eggs were bland, and Cholula and salt only helped so much. It was amazing: the friend to my left ate this fantastic waffle, and the rest of us were poking at the eggs wondering what we did to deserve such bad luck. Long story short, if I'm back and not chowing down on curds, I'm ordering the waffle."}
{"text":"Amazing food - always great customer service!  A must if you are stopping in Madison!  This was the first restaurant I ate at in Madison and it really is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"A nice atmosphere, good service, decent food and a good selection of beers. I tried the cheese curd and a vegetarian sandwich, both were delicious and I didn't regret any bite."}
{"text":"I've come to Old Fashioned both times I've been to Madison, and I have not been disappointed either time!  The Cheese Curds here, from the limited places I've tried, are the best.  I'm sure someone from Wisconsin will disagree with me, but man they are good!!  The service is always friendly and the beer choices are plentiful!  As far as the rest of the menu, there are plenty of choices although I stuck with the same dish both times I've came here which was the breaded Walleye sandwich.  It is YUMMY!  Be warned, it is very big and can easily be shared.  If you are in town because you are passing through, or for an event, give this place a shot! I have not been disappointed yet and plan on returning again next year."}
{"text":"We were passing through Madison on our way from Minneapolis to Milwaukee and decided to use our trusty Yelp app to find some lunch.  The old fashioned came highly recommended.  There was a few comments made about their lunch counter service.  I honestly think it made it quicker and easier to get out during lunch, so no problems here.  We were still waited on as If there had been table service.  We were excited to try their homemade jerky! It was excellent and only $1 a piece.  We also tried the chili...different but very good.  The meals are all very fairly priced and a lot of food for the money.  I had the spinach salad.  I highly recommend it.  The hot bacon dressing was awesome.   My husband had the shaved prime rib special.  There was not a crumb left. This place was definitely worth going out of the way for.  Great view of the state Capital."}
{"text":"This is one of the best experiences I've ever had. Period. Waiters name was Josh and was EXTREMELY pleasant and very helpful. The food came EXTREMELY fast and was EXTREMELY good. The experience itself was extreme without even being over dramatic. It was such a nice surprise. The only thing that I disliked was that I eventually had to leave. Not only recommend this beautiful concoction of Wisconsin culture and great food, but can't stop raving about it. It does run the average consumer $15 a meal I'd say so do consider that but this place is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Our fave place in Madison. Yes, a lot of people go here, yes it's always packed, and yes, it's wonderful.  I've tried different items each visit (but always get the curds!) Burger is great, the BLT with heirloom tomatoes is wonderful, and the beet salad is awesome.   Beer is king here and you won't be disappointed. It's one of those places that has great reviews that deserve it! Go. Now."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at The Old Fashioned. I travel to Madison a lot for work and always come to The Old Fashioned when I'm in town. They are the BEST cheese curds that I've ever had (although my only experiences have been at various Madison restaurants). The sarvecchio salad is delicious as well. The bacon mac and cheese is also a must have (if you can handle that much cheese- but it is Wisconsin, after all!). Drinks are also on point! There's pretty much always a wait though. If you go in the evenings, you can expect to usually wait about an hour (and that's on weeknights, not much experience with the weekends)."}
{"text":"Went here after a hockey game last winter 2013-14 in subzero temps. Got to see an ambulance pick up a homeless individual (presumably) from the curb. Glad to see that because it was dangerously cold. Didn't get an old- fashioned but tried a local beer on tap. Fish fry was good. Cheese curds were great. Burger was good. Had to wait  about 30 minutes awkwardly standing at bar sort of in walkway.. Two- tops are very close together and we heard the entire conversation of the girl at next table pretending to be a friend but totally hitting on the guy having girlfriend problems.  Wait staff decent but we were seated by the door and froze because they allow bar patrons to stand pretty much anywhere including smoking halfway in and out the door."}
{"text":"On a Saturday evening my 4 dining companions and I made a visit (first time my myself) to the Old Fashioned at 5pm. The place was not too busy yet but a decent crowed had begun to make its way in by this time. We were seated upstairs where its a bit more quiet. I was not aware they had an upstairs until this visit. Our waiter was very informative and knowledgeable of the menu items and the preparation of the foods and sauces, and the way several drinks were made and how they taste. The others in my group all got either  beer or an Old Fashioned of their choosing, I passed on drinks to save room for what I had been reading reviews on over the past week. Yelp gave the menu overwhelming positive reviews across the board so I was pretty sure I was going to have an easy time finding something both filling, tasty and affordable on this visit. Lets take a quick walk through this visit so prep your senses for some teasing because that's just what your in for!  My appetizer was the soup of the day($3). I got the bowl sized serving of spicy black bean and pork with corn. This was a beef broth based soup with a slight peppery note to it. The pork was shaved and very tasty. The black beans could have been cooked a little bit softer but a great soup none the less.  My main course was the No 30. Old Fashioned House Burger. ($9.95) A 6 oz burger (ordered mine medium) with fried onions, hickory smoked bacon, aged cheddar, garlic sauce, a soft cooked egg and a buttered, toasted roll. I upgraded my side item to the very highly recommended (yelp) beer battered cheese curds ($3 extra). The burger was absolutely phenomenal! Messy but not like sloppy-joe messy, simply so much substance to the burger that it becomes hard to handle. But worth it of course! My only comment here is that my burger was cooked well done (I checked after a couple bites in) vs the medium I had asked for. Outside of that, a hit for sure! The cheese curds were so good I could feel myself becoming more and more connected with all things Wisconsin on every bite I took I swear! Like small peaces of golden softness that melted in your mouth. The nice part about them is that they use a very light and thin breading leaving mostly pure Wisconsin cheese to hit your pallet! These are a must if you have not had cheese curds before or have not had them in a long time (such as my case).  If that was not enough read on.....I did go and ask to see a dessert menu (the only one in my party with room to dare ask for more). The waiter told me that the Fruit Crisp with Vanilla Spice Ice Cream ($4.95) was currently stawberry-rhubarb. That sold me right there! The ice cream was spiced with cinnamon and was good but not amazing. I was expecting a cold ice cream topping with a warm pie underneath and perhaps a crust at the bottom. Instead the fruit portion of the pie was also cold as well. Not a bad thing just not the contrast I expected. Nor did I find the crusty top or bottom I would have liked either but still, a very sweet, fruity and satisfying end to a great meal indeed!  My bill which came to just under $24 was a fair price to pay for the portions, quality and service my group and I received on this visit. I will be looking to make a return to The Old Fashioned soon to try several of their other burger listing but also to try what looks to be (and has been reviewed as) a fantastic brunch menu which for this food blogger always gets my attention!"}
{"text":"Should I chalk this up to a night of mishaps?  - Gave name at host stand. Quoted 15-20 minutes. Given buzzer. Went to bar for drinks. 45 minutes later, check back at host stand to see what's going on, and hey, our names have been accidentally crossed off the list.  - Due to the mishap, we were offered the next table that became available. One by the door on a cold and drafty night. And yes, I understand this place has double doors, but that doesn't mean people understand how to use them.  - Ordered food. It was decent. I wasn't screaming \"OH MY GOD THESE CHEESE CURDS\". (Try Bad Apple in Chicago). The Lazy Susan with the herring was mostly great, but the deviled eggs were terrible. Beer cheese soup was overly salty too.  - Lastly, all I really wanted to try was the chocolate milk...which was forgotten (obviously, to go with the theme of the night).   Actually, chalk it up to inattentive service due to the crowds of people that want to eat here. Next time, I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Local staple. Good beer/bar options. Yummy curds. Rich good food. Come hungry, but expect to wait. Giant portions.  1st time in Madison & EVERY person recommended we go here. Brunch for 4 people on Saturday (game day)= 2 hour wait, which we didn't do & Sunday= 40 minute wait, which we DID do. 2 bars available that are \"first come\" while you wait. Extensive drink menu but we stuck to the \"Wisconsin\" Bloody Mary (jerky, curds, pickled egg, horseradish) & beer! 60 draft beers available, all of which are Wisconsin breweries. To start, Cheese curds w/ sauces (tiger, tiger blue, smoked paprika) were the best curds of the weekend! Entrees were Walleye & eggs, Walleye sandwich, & Wisconsin Benedict (w/ wurst pattie)... all delicious but giant portions & heavy in general. Shareable for sure! For a group of 4 we could of split 2 entrees. A \"lazy Susan\" sampler (PHOTO) of local meats, cheeses, snacks & such was ordered. Again lots of food & good EXCEPT for the creamed herring (SOO fishy)... must be an acquired taste."}
{"text":"The burger here was delicious.  That burger (and all the other food) would get at least a 4.5 star rating from me, which is impressive because I am often a bit of a snob when it comes to ground beef patties.  Why the three star review then? The awful awful awful service and complete confusion.  Lets go back to the beginning.  We went to The Old Fashioned for 2 for 1 burger night.  We had a 30 minute wait, but we were able to get spots at the bar.  We loved the ambiance of the place, I was beyond happy with my $2.50 beer of the month.  While I had asked to close out our bar tab, a bill never came (in the 20 minutes of waiting for it).  When the hostess called our name, I left some cash on the bar in hopes that it covered our tab.  After we were seated, this continued to go downhill.  It took a while for our server to come and he was really confused by our order.  Two of us got the #30, the other two got the #31.  Those are the two burger options on the menu so obviously it was rather apparent that we were there for 2 for 1 burger night.  He asked each of us what we wanted on the side and we had the option of salad or fries.  Fairly easy, right?  Wrong.  Our food came and mine was the only order that wasn't completely messed up.  Everyone else had questionable things with there meals and the ended up having to take everything back and rearranging it all.  I was a little confused because myself and my other friend who got the 30 had massive sides whereas our friends that ordered 31s got sides that were normal portions.  When our bill came there was some serious confusion.  Those of us who had ordered 30s got 2 for 1 burgers, the 31s were normal price.  But those of us who had ordered 30s were charged for our sides. While the menu says that all burgers/sandwiches come with the choice of fries or salad, apparently that doesn't always apply?  Displeased.  The reason I got so frustrated with the bill is that we obviously were trying to take advantage of the deal.  The server easily could have told us that only certain burgers were 2 for 1 and that if you got those burgers they didn't come with sides, but you could order some to share (which I would have done).  It was the first time in a very long time that I didn't tip at least 20%.  Go here for the food, but don't expect good service."}
{"text":"My wife and I went Saturday night (7/30/16) for our anniversary. We expected loud and raucous, and were not disappointed. The food, also, was uniformly good:  My prime rib was delectable, and cooked perfectly. My wife's rainbow trout, likewise, was incredible (her words). The Dark Helmet Schwartz was tasty, as were the desserts: she had the brownie with ice cream, I had the seasonal fruit crisp.   Our challenge was the service...  At the check-in stand, the hostess was interacting with me as if she were an employee at the DMV. No \"how can I help you?\" No \"welcome to the Old Fashioned.\" Certainly no smile. The exchange was: \"How many in your party?\" Followed by \"phone number?\" In fact, the DMV has better service than we were greeted with. We were quoted a wait time of 30 minutes. It was 45 before we got a table. No apology for the extended wait was offered. Probably not a problem for five or ten extra minutes of waiting. But for 50% longer than quoted? You probably want your system programmed to send out updates, and your host staff to be apologizing.   Once seated, we waited another 10 minutes for our server, Hannah, to show up. She took our drink orders, and returned with my soda, and the bartender followed with my wife's beer a few moments later. I liked the taste of her beer, so I ordered one. Our drinks were not refilled for the entire evening, nor was any offer was made to refill them. Additionally, the server rushed my wife to order dessert while I was still eating. She also \"checked\" twice with us during dessert to see if we were ready for the bill.   We understand that The Old Fashioned is a busy place, especially on a Saturday night. When I'm dropping $70 on dinner for two, I expect better service, even if the food is superb."}
{"text":"The best cheese curds in the state of Wisconsin can be found here.  Cool location - on the capital square in Madison."}
{"text":"So the place was packed Friday night. We decided to start with Brandy Old Fashioned. What a wonderful cocktail. It was so good I chased it with several more. Then we ordered the cheese curds. By far the best I have ever had. I had the Old Fashioned burger and it was great. If have not been you should try it out and if you have been you know what I am talking about"}
{"text":"Yummy cheese platter that we split as an appetizer. However, I got a too too large salad consisting mostly of spinach and was sub-par. My fiance got a very good hamburger though. I would go back but just order the cheese platter as a meal."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to visit if you're in the Madison area. This was my first trip to Wisconsin, and few people recommended this place. Sure, it may not have been the home of the original Old Fashion, but that's up for debate. Otherwise, they still make a pretty good Old Fashion, and they have four different types to choose from. They have a full bar, and plenty of beer options, bottled and tap. The portions are large, and fill your belly up. I do like the numbering system on the menu, which makes it easier to order, especially if you're not familiar with certain dishes. Also great place to get cheese curds for first time. The portions are almost too heavy, and probably not great to eat on an average. We had a big party as well, and our table seemed a bit too cramped; they could've accommodate just a bit, because the place was empty when we arrived. Good place. Will return."}
{"text":"Hands-down my favorite Cap Square restaurant - it's so refreshing to have a non-snooty affordable option!  Excellent before a Bartell show.  Try the summer sausage sandwich - it's AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"The cheese curds were yummy.  I had the spicy burger.  It was a solid burger.  The fries were okay.  The beer selection was very good.  Had the Pumpkin beer that was fantastic."}
{"text":"There is a reason there is a line around the block when you get there~ Best Fish fry anywhere!"}
{"text":"First Cheese curd I have ever eaten.  It was absolutely delicious. Was in Milwaukee a few days after my trip to the Old Fashioned and insisted a friend try the cheese curds.  They were not from the Old Fashioned and were nowhere near as good.  Will only have cheese curds if I am here!   Had a great burger here as well."}
{"text":"BEER, BEER, and more beer.....  This place is top notch - the beer selection alone should allow for the five star rating but then you couple the food choices on top of it and PRESTO!!!  Right on the Capital Square, this beautiful little restaurant has options for everyone including some excellent vegetarian choices!!  Charming, cozy, atmosphere - two huge bars - you may have to wait a few minutes to get a seat but it's well worth it.  Stay classy my friends!"}
{"text":"A great gem in downtown Madison, just steps away from the capitol building. Getting around this part of Madison can be a little crazy for a first time visitor but if you have patience, this place is worth it. While I don't drink there are a large variety of craft beers in tap, in addition to root beer on tap that is delicious. For lunch I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was amazing. The sandwich was a dry version and had a pickled relish on it that was amazing. The pork was so moist that there was no need for any additional sauce. I also got the deep fried cheese curds which were fantastic. So good, bite sized mozzarella sticks!"}
{"text":"The curds are great. The sandwiches are good. They have a meat raffle (what's that? you'll just have to go to find out). Beer is always great and they mix a mean cocktail.   It's a busy restaurant, so the wait can get a little long at times. I guess that's not a good reason to deduct a star, but I'm an impatient person and there are equally good options nearby.   But really, get the curds. Second best in Madison."}
{"text":"A old friend recommended that we meet here last night and I'm so glad we did! The Old Fashioned has absolutely delicious food! I ordered the cheese curds with garlic sauce (highly recommend!) and a hot dog (also very delicious). My husband got the #30 burger and some fries, along with a beer. Our bill was about $30, so the prices are great. Particularly, their drinks are super reasonably priced (although I'm not drinking currently). The place was a little loud and we did have to wait for a table, but that's to be expected on a Sunday night. My only complaint is that the hostess was rude while we were waiting. There wasn't much room while we were standing around and she copped an attitude as my friend was trying to get out of her way. Also, they asked for my number as a way to reserve a table. I couldn't hear my text message go off....and found it strange that they didn't announce that my table was ready considering that I was standing right in front of them. I'll make sure to have my phone ready next time. Our server was friendly and OK in terms of being attentive. Would definitely recommend The Old Fashioned to others."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is what can only be described as the perfect Wisconsin pub.  Weekends always seem to be full of people, as the food is good, and the location is great being right on the capital square. This is a perfect place to grab good (as the name suggests) old fashioned pub food and a beer.   I've gone to the Old Fashioned quite a few times, but most recently I went for the fish fry with my sister.  Being born and raised Wisconsinites, we know a good fish fry.  This definitely was one of the best.   Also as with most fish fries, it comes with coleslaw.  I have never been a slaw person in my life...  this was the first time I actually enjoyed and ate all of the coleslaw on my plate.  So A+ for that!!   Favorite item on their menu: The Old-Fashioned House Burger.... Trust me it is a MUST. Prices: For food and drinks - Completely reasonable - similar to that of prices within the Madison area."}
{"text":"As a post interview treat, I invited a friend I was staying with to join me here for dinner. SO GOOD. We started with the classic old fashioned cocktails - not too sweet, not too overwhelming, and beautifully presented with an orange slice and maraschino cherry stabbed with a sword. Nicely muddled together and only $5.50 each.  It was a little rough to catch the bartender's attention, but he noticed easily once i flopped my arms across the entire bar table top. He was swamped with orders.  Next we were seated in the loud restaurant, complete with dark mood lighting, and ordered a batch of cheese curds with roasted garlic sauce even though the paprika sauce is most popular. They were melty warm balls of cheesy love, the batter/breading not overwhelming so you could appreciate the cheese for its own delightfulness.  There were a little greasy on the fingers but light to snack on. The garlic was weak in my opinion but the curds didn't even need it.  Overall, the BEST curds I've ever had!  My finally was a light spring green salad next to my spicy burger - pepperjack, potent raw jalapenos, thick sliced bacon, and the spicy paprika sauce.  I couldn't see my burger in the mood light (but I could see my greasy looking waiter [he was polite so I forgive his need of a shower on such a busy and unseasonably warm night]) but it was AMAZING: juicy, thick, perfectly cooked to my rare-medium order, and with enough spicy to make my nose run and tongue tingle.  My one regret is not trying one of the many beers offered.  I recommend everyone visiting Madison stop in for classic Wisconsin tastes!"}
{"text":"The name really lets you know what kind of a place this is - this isn't a hip, trendy new place. It's old-fashioned! But it's charming in that way, when that's what you're looking for.  Excellent beer list - about 50 on tap, and all from in-state (I think they said they might have had one Minnesota beer at one point, but pretty much all Wisconsin all the time). I think their flights are the way to go. Great way to try a couple of selections, and the bartenders are more than happy to help you pick out some beers (or even give you tasters before you get your flight, which is awesome!).  For me, what really made this place stand out was some excellent service. The bartenders were happy to chat beer with you (or anything else), and really just wanted you to have an excellent afternoon there. It gets busy during brunch time (can't speak for anything else, since I was there on a Sunday afternoon, but there were people waiting for tables when I walked in), but if you want a seat at the bar, it's first-come first-served. Worth noting that there are two bars actually, so if you don't see a seat at the first bar, try going around the corner!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place! A friend recommended this restaurant and we're glad we stopped by on our way home from the Dells. The cheese curds are very tasty as was the salad we split for an appetizer. Both my wife and I ordered the Tuesday special: a taco platter consisting of 3 different tacos, rice, and beans. There are many Mexican restaurants who don't achieve that level of quality - the fish taco was one of the best I've ever had. We would be back sooner if we lived closer to Madison."}
{"text":"Update- If I could change this to 3.5 stars, I would. Went back and had the cheese curds again and enjoyed it. I also had their walleye sandwich and was happy with it. A tastier dining experience compared to my first visit. Their onion string fries are quite good too."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place better. By the looks of the photos on here I think I just had a below average experience.   We went this July - knew it would be crowded and it was. No biggie, we were prepared to have a drink while we waited anyways and found two barstools open at the bar! I ordered the Brandy Slush - a past favorite of my wives. It wasn't mixed right - was way too sweet and didn't have the right mix - and the bartender was a bit of a jerk. No big deal, but probably won't get that again.   Saw a co-worker at the bar who told us they love love love the Cheese Curds here. My first mistake was not ordering any. I guess I wasn't in a fried cheese curd mood - plus I ended up ordering the Mac and Cheese with Ring Bologna and figured that would be enough cheese. Maybe it had to do with the fact that it was Summer and hot - but I did not enjoy the Mac and Cheese and Ring Bologna. The cheese sauce was not yummy or impressive and although the Ring Bologna may have been of good quality - it wasn't what I expected. Might have been better on a super cold wintery night. My wife got a sandwich and that looked much better.  Service was OK considering they were packed full and had a good waiting list. From the photos online and other dishes I saw around me, I think I'll give this place another try - but from this first visit I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Madison. A solid selection of WI beer on tap (usually about 30-40 available), complemented by an array of bottled craft beer. The food is also excellent - can't pass on the cheese curds and Old Fashioned burger!"}
{"text":"When a friend highly recommends a place to go to when you're in a different city. You take his/her advice and go with it. There's a very good reason why they're totally compelled to tell you that their cheese curds here are the shiznit,,, Because it truly is.     As coney dogs is synonymous Detroit, MI , chicken wings is to Buffalo, NY ,, Cheese curds is the official currency of Madison, WI. The ones served here in this very restaurant is not to be missed if you are visiting. Make sure you order the garlic dipping sauce,, trust me,, it is the perfect pairing to battered and deep fried nuggets of cheese.     I was blessed to experience their Taco Tuesday special, I had the pork, the chicken and the fish. The best tasting out of the three,, FISH. Yummy crunchy good stuff in a soft taco, it is very very delish.     The rustic feel of the place seems hella authentic and I bet it is. Plus you can't beat the location with a stick. The staff is amazing, prompt and very accomodating. The beer is cold, the food arrives hot and served in a plate. Life could not get any better.   Weeeeeeeeeee"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and food. Upbeat atmosphere. One of must-visit Madison restaurants. Service can be pushy or slow sometimes."}
{"text":"All right, I' am sure I am going to catch some flak over this review, so let me just say read through to the end before passing judgement. I've been to The Old Fashioned twice and while my meals have been good, it hasn't been anything to shout about. Maybe I'm ordering wrong, or my expectations are too high.  The first time was on an early Saturday afternoon around 3pm. There was no wait, but it was fairly crowded nonetheless and we sat at the bar. I had the beer cheese soup and the spinach salad with hot bacon dressing. The salad was large but a touch out of balance; it sort of felt like a big pile of spinach. In addition, it was delivered with no dressing and took well over 5 minutes to flag down a server to get it. The soup was great in flavor and thickness but I found the popcorn garnish a touch contrived and honestly distracting in flavor; oyster crackers would be better. Maybe I should have just asked?  (Aside: I don't recall what my companion had.)  The second time was on a busy Sunday evening, and I went specifically to get the Scandinavian roast chicken special since it sounded so original on my first visit. I'd say it was a bit of a let down. We started with the cheese curds and they're a little salty, but easily the best I've had. Great stuff, particularly the dipping sauce that came with. The smashed red bliss potatoes were good and the gravy flavorful. Accompanying roasted carrots and parsnips were great.The sausage currant dressing was wet enough to have been stuffing (I am not sure it it was cooked in the bird or in a dish) and splashed with a good ladle of gravy. It was ok; the sausage and currant flavors were mild and I think those flavors could have been more assertive. The chicken was a good portion but if the menu didn't tell me the spices I would not have known. It was supposed to be cardamom, cinnamon and juniper which are all strong flavors but they were unnoticeable in the meat and barely noticeable on the skin. The skin itself was not crisp at all and perhaps a little oily; the flesh of the bird a touch greasy. Maybe they're using some kind of organic / local bird and I'm not used to it? I almost felt it was a capon rather than a chicken. Hrm.  My partner on the second visit had the salmon salad with tarragon vinagrette. I got to sample that and thought it was excellent, with crispy bacon, cold poached salmon and finely sliced red onions over mixed greens. There may have been some pecans, but I do not believe my bites had any. The tarragon vinaigrette was spot-on in flavor and surprisingly thick; it makes me think of cold Bearnaise in both appearance and richness. It seems unlikely, but I would definitely recommend this dish.  Dessert was a brownie served with grasshopper ice cream separately and we shared both. The brownie itself was nothing to write home about but the ice cream came drizzled with creme de menthe and was very good.  As I said at the start, I think I'm just not choosing wisely here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm used to non-jazzed-up versions of these things at real supper clubs up in the northwoods and am a little put off by a quasi-hip reinvention. I suppose I'm going to have to try the burgers, which all look fabulous. Prices seem remarkably good across the board now that I think about it. They could probably raise prices a buck across the board and it would still be a good value. I'm going to give it another go and see what happens.  Cocktails:  Visit 1: Brandy Old Fashioned, sour. Good, flavorful, strong. Visit 2: Brand Old Fashioned, \"press\" (soda and sprite). Not as good; weaker in both alcohol and flavors. I blame the soda. Stick to the classics, right? =)  One final note: I'm a modern guy and sometimes fail to carry cash; it's 2012, you know? So I got a drink at the bar my companion simply wanted water. I asked to have it placed on my dinner tab. I was told they don't do that here. Ok, no problem, here's my card, just charge it. I was told there's a $10 minimum for a charge. It's not the bartender's fault those policies were in effect, but perhaps when the hostess indicates you can wait for your table at the bar she should mention these (frankly ridiculous) policies. I was pretty embarrassed in front of the woman I was dining with. While I really should have had some cash on me -- I was running late and it was pouring rain so I missed going to the ATM, so I'm partially at fault -- it still doesn't excuse it."}
{"text":"Being from the Midwest, the Old Fashioned is legitimately one of my favorite pubs to visit. Great food (cheese curds + #30 burger) and great beers. No complaints at all. Don't miss it when you are in Madison!"}
{"text":"Very typical American food I think...nothing to boast about, but lots of people like to come here when they visit Wisconsin, or even those who live here find it extremely popular. The one unique thing I saw on the menu--aside from the regular burgers and french fries and stuff--was a chili spaghetti. I had never heard of this before, and my friend said that's how it's served \"Green Bay\" style, so of course I had to try it! It was good, but not something I would order at a restaurant again...simply because I can easily boil spaghetti and a can of chili at home myself. The cheese curds which are quite unique to Wisconsin were amazing though! It was my first time trying cheese curds here and I liked it...but the rest of the week I went around ordering cheese curds from all kinds of places and I realized that the ones I had at Old Fashioned weren't the best in town. But it is a decent place to sit and have a beer with friends and snack on good ol greasy American foods! =)"}
{"text":"How can you NOT have an Old Fashioned drink and an Old Fashioned Burger!!??  Both proved to be well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is well-located, however, it missed the mark for me.  Nobody, that I was with, liked their food, including me.  It was all very low-quality food.  The prices were very reasonable, especially given the location, however, I've had better food at fast-food establishments.  Also, the hostess and our server were very unfriendly and borderline rude.  We didn't appreciate the bad attitudes.  I understand that we all have bad days, but, when I reviews places, customer service is part of the overall experience.  However, first and foremost, for me, the food is, definitely, the most important part of the experience, and, given the fact, that nobody liked their food, it is what it is."}
{"text":"If you're taking an out of state person to eat, and they say...show me what wisconsin is all about...the old fashion has it.  it's got pabst and blatz on tap, servers brandy ol' fashions and some of the best fried cheese curds around.  the burgers are good to gooder and the walleye sandwich always gets good reviews.  over all a good experience.  it's not overly pricey, they have good specials (see 2 for 1 burger night) and a great beer selection.  as well as a great location.     (yes, to get 5 stars you really have to work hard in my system and they were pretty close.  the burgers tho are just 4 star material tho)"}
{"text":"As an airline pilot I can say that I eat out quite often. And I can say this was the best breakfast ever. I had corned beef hash, two eggs, potatoes and bread. The corned beef was amazing! Chunks of beef, not some unidentified microscopic thing on your plate. The service was great. I asked for a second cup of coffee and the waiter leaves me the whole pot and says, let me know if you want more. I'll be back to The Old Fashioned on my next layover."}
{"text":"Best place I went to in Madison. So good that I came here twice while on a business trip. The place just reminded me of an college town bar. The decorations are cheesy and old school, but add to the charm of the place.  The food here was what stole the show. First of all, they have probably around 30 beers on tap and almost all of them are from Wisconsin. My co-workers and I had cheese appetizers, which were great! The cheese was soft and delicious. Out of all the fried cheese curds I had over the week, this place had the best ones! The burger I had was incredible and at the end of the night, my bill was under $15. It doesn't get better than that!  FYI- this place is popular, so you will probably have to wait. We only waited 20 minutes for our table when they originally told us 40 minutes. Just grab a beer at the bar and time will go by quicker than you can imagine!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get the cheese curds. You won't regret it!  Great selection of beers, too. Solid place to grab a few beers and some snacks to share."}
{"text":"I'm a traveler and this is the place to be in Madison... Ask for Jay or Lisa if you sit at the Bar and tell them Alister sent you.  I eat here even if I'm driving through Madison."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with a friend. We ordered a cheese plate (no. 3), the Old Fashioned Burger with cheese curds and two cocktails.  First off, it was a hour and a half wait. Not surprised given that it was dinner time on a Saturday night. Was not in a rush to eat so we decided to wait it out. Now, the cool thing (that is very new to me) was that the establishment utilizes an app, called \"The List,\" which tells you exactly where you are on the waiting list. Then they text you when your table is ready. Technology these days!  Next, the food is superb. Everything was so yummy in my tummy. The staff are attentive and quick.   Lastly, the cocktails were disgusting. I got a Berry Seabreeze and my friend got a Hummingbird Nectar, but they were both very strong and all we tasted was the alcohol. Apparently, Madison has a very high rate of drinkers so I guess my taste buds are different than the locals here. However, I will be forgiving and still rate it five stars because I had a good experience overall."}
{"text":"Definitely the best cheese curds in Madison and maybe the best I have ever eaten! A wide variety of menu items that will make everyone in the family happy. Also, very friends staff and they put the customers first. Can't wait to go back! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not much left to say here but how about some small tidbits! If you come at 4pm there isn't a wait. They have an app for if you are waiting which makes it nice to see how much time you have left. The mini beer tasting platter is amazing. Stick with their signature drinks and don't go crazy and order a moscow mule. Portions are gigantic - come hungry! You won't spend all your money here - prices are great."}
{"text":"Went for New Years! Will be back. Dancing, fun atmosphere, huge bar, booth seating. Had a tasty old fashion, beer, and free champagne!"}
{"text":"Love their cheese curds. The tiger sauce is BOMB. they also have great burgers. I take any Madison visitors here! Obviously you have to order an old fashioned"}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here on a Friday night, promptly seated on the second floor, where the ceiling is strung with brightly colored pennants. Our server was polite and prompt but seemed a little down. Not a complaint, I just felt kinda bad for her. Anyway, knowing I was about to eat my way through our Madison weekend, I ordered something on the lighter side - No. 35, the grilled eggplant and portabella sandwich. But I got it with cheese curds. Because it's Wisconsin, and I had to. Anyway, the sandwich was filling and good, although the eggplant was on the chewy side. My husband was very pleased with his No. 27 prime rib sandwich - note that you can't get it without onions though. I think he got it with a cup of the clam chowder soup of the day instead of the usual fries. A bit of an odd combination but that was tasty too.   A good place to stop if you're near the Capitol and want well done, local fare but without the fuss of some of the fancier spots around the square."}
{"text":"Go for lunch! Speedy and efficient service. You are seted at a table with menus. Then, told the specials. The service staff prompts you to order your drink and food at a quick and efficient line at the bar where a chashier takes your order and runners bring them out to your table. This is a really unique concept because Old Fashion gets really busy for lunch because of its location on the square. We had a group of 4 of us. The beer selection was imense. All of us had old fashions too. Cheese curds were some of the best in town. My walley sanwich was delicious. Very lightly breaded and crispy. I can't remeber what everyoneelse had because we didn't share our plates. it was a business lunch and we did more talking and discussing business than raving about our food. Really reasonably priced and quick service too. Try it. It is a must if you are new to town."}
{"text":"696 reviews cannot be wrong.  Get the fried cheese curds and a beer flight, and you will not have any complaints.  Not that fried cheese curds are ever bad, but these were phenomenal.  Your choice of sauce comes on the side, or you can get them as a side to your sandwich.  Personally I chose to get them as a meal with a side salad.  When in Wisconsin!  The beer choices are amazing.  You can get flights of 4, 8, or 12 I believe.  Plus they come in little boards shaped like Wisconsin.  Tons of options from breweries all over Wisconsin, and a handy little map on the back of the menu shows you where each brewery is located.  We went on a Thursday night and were seated in about 10-15 minutes despite an initiate estimate of 20-25.  They text you so you don't have to hover and wait for your name to be called, plus they introduced me to the app called 'The List.'  I wish more restaurants used it because it shows you where you are on the list.  Less guesswork for you and less hassle for the hostess.  Don't think this is an overrated tourist stop; it was definitely one of our faves of Madison!"}
{"text":"What is there to say about The Old Fashioned that hasn't been said before?  The cheese curds are really good. The fish fry is pretty nice as well. The haystack onion strings are also salty and delish.  However, I'll have to say that my experience at The Old Fashioned was forever changed when I got their No. 50. Oh yes. It is a \"wood-grilled 16 oz. Rib-eye of beef topped with a pat of Wisconsin sweet-cream butter and served with matchstick fries, tiger sauce and grilled Texas toast\" for $27.95.  But wait. The rib-eye sits atop the fries, which means the fries taste like meaty goodness. The Texas toast is so buttery and delicious. And that pat of Wisconsin sweet-cream butter? That really makes the meat melt in your mouth.  Also, if you're going for a drink or two, hit up the bar in the second room (not the first bar you see when you walk in). The bartenders there are great!  Oh, since they don't take reservations, try to get there early and put in your name. They'll take down your phone number and text you when a table is ready. That means you can walk around the Square or go grab a drink elsewhere before meandering back."}
{"text":"Great. cheesecurds, burgers, mac and cheese, and other pub favs are very good. If only getting a seat didn't take soooooo long."}
{"text":"Ate there last night. So good! Cheese curds were amazing and the onion straws are everything an onion ring wished it were. I had the brat and was presently surprised. It had been 28 years since my last visit to Madison when I graduated from U W and I had missed brats and cheese curds and this restaurant made we remember why.  It is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I see what all the fuss is about. Loved this place.   The Old Fashioned was packed so we ate at the bar. The traditional old fashioneds were really delicious. The deep fried cheese curds were some of the best I've ever had. We split a burger and a fish sandwich; both were prepared with care and skill. Nom!   Known as a place that is always busy. It's noisy, busy, and frenetic. Not good for a quiet dinner or a first date. Service wasn't super slow, but it's wasn't fast either."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit. LOVE the Wisconsin products and focus with a modern twist. We will be back when in Madison!"}
{"text":"The food is very good here, and I would definitely say this is one of the more popular places in Madison. I suggest dropping by for brunch, because dinner and late night drinks get packed.   Portions are generous, and they serve all of the Wisconsin essentials: cheese curds, beer, and whiskey. There is definitely better food nearby, but The Old Fashioned is the \"go-to\" restaurant whenever you are in doubt. It's a busy, warm, and sometimes rowdy restaurant/bar which caters to the diverse crowd located in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love this place for an after work cocktail (Old Milwaukee and Schlitz on tap!) but I recently had a fish fry that was pretty bad. I had the combo platter and the walleye was burnt. I asked for a replacement and they brought out a slightly less burnt piece. My friend had a turkey sandwich which he was not thrilled with. I had a stomach ache the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Delicious! A great selection of cocktails and draft beers as well, plus friendly service (at least at the bar)!"}
{"text":"Not bad - lunch is easy. Beer is cold-ish. It's a place that doesn't vary in quality much - that is to say, the quality is high and consistent. That's worth a lot in my book. You can count on good food, drinks."}
{"text":"Not the best cheese curds in Madison, but probably the largest serving.  Didn't get enough ranch to match the amount of curds in the basket.  I had one heck of a sandwich, which I thought was priced fairly at $8.95 and included fries or tossed green salad.  The salad didn't have nearly enough dressing, and was just lettuce.  There were other sides available for an extra $1-$3.  But the sandwich was good enough that I would come back to try a few more menu items.   PS-  the best cheese curds aren't in Madison; they are in Monona."}
{"text":"I love the MAC AND CHEESE at the Old Fashioned! Nowhere can beat it!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant you recommend to Madison tourists who want to eat \"Wisconsin\" food. This is also a good spot to eat, drink, and repeat. I can't count the number of times I've stopped at the Ol' Fash for a drink and dinner only to stay for an hour longer for just \"one more drink\" and a plate of cheese curds (with tiger sauce!) to share with friends. Servers are fast and to the point, and there's a whole lot of comfort food. Whether it's their low-key isthmus famous cheese curds, Friday fish fry, or a burger, I'm a BIG stickler for their Walleye sandwich. It is probably my FAVORITE thing to eat when I am hungry and my bank account tells me I can't afford to get dinner over $10. I probably get it 95% of the time when I'm here because it's so gosh darn good. Beer battered walleye with shredded cabbage, shaved radish, and house-made lemon-caper tartar sauce on toasted country bread. The crispy deep fried fish, tart and creamy tartar sauce, and thick toasted bread combination is delicious.  It's the best. I pretty much rave about it anytime The Old Fashioned comes up in conversation. That and their mini donuts at breakfast which are just...so warm and sweet and and perfect to share while you're waiting for the rest of your breakfast to get there.  At the end of the day, The Old Fashioned is what you want for an easy going dinner experience. Good comfort food for an affordable price, and a nice old fashioned to go along with it, of course."}
{"text":"This place is so great - it's easy to see why it's always so busy. They have one of the most impressive bars/tap lists I've seen to date and the atmosphere is so nice. Also, their cheese curds are some of the best in the city.  Have yet to try a single thing on the menu that wasn't incredible. If you've got any room left after dinner, get a cookie - yum!"}
{"text":"A little pricey and their menu isn't the most extensive, but everything is tasty. Just be warned you WILL wait for a table pretty much every night, which is kind of annoying, but overall it's a Madison staple so everyone should try it once."}
{"text":"Awesome first stop for us in Madison- in for the CrossFit Games- first time to Madison. Will be coming back this trip for sure! The Cheese Curds are delicious with the paprika dipping sauce and the best BLT ever with super fresh heirloom tomatoes."}
{"text":"This place is great! I came here with 2 of my gfs for lunch and we were already full from breakfast so we just ordered a few things and just shared like appetizers. We ordered a cheese plate which was really good. We also got their chili with spaghetti which was my personal fave! All i all, I would def be back here when I'm in Madison! Such a great spot to eat and mingle with friends. They have outdoor seating which is nice!"}
{"text":"I think the best summation of The Old Fashioned is Welcome to Madison, Wisconsin! Anybody who visits me must go here, because it is the number one iconic restaurant/bar of Madison. Incredible variety of beer selection (and all from Wisco), great root beer, great mixed drinks (it is called the Old Fashioned, after all...), great food. A personal favorite is the good ole Turkey Sandwich #33 and/or the #20 Salad (especially if they're willing to sub the bleu cheese with goat cheese!). They're cheese curds are also some of the best in Madison.  The place gets very busy on weekend (and often weekday) evenings and for lunch. I have never been to a weekend brunch but very frequently go for the weekday breakfast. They have rotating egg scramblers which are to die for and when you order a mimosa, they ask you if you want it in a pint glass! Need I say more?! (fear not, you can get a boring old champagne flute if you prefer). The bar staff is always very friendly and I love coming here to sit at the bar and hang out and chat when they are not super busy. I imagine most Madisonians already know how great the Old Fashioned is, but in case anyone didn't... IT IS! A must do for Madison."}
{"text":"One word: cheese curds. That's really all you need to know. DELICIOUS! The absolute best, and that says a lot coming from a Wisconsinite. I really enjoyed how I could pick and choose what goes in to my beverages, down to the bitters they use. The only thing I dislike about this place is the long wait every single time due to the small space."}
{"text":"I'm changing my rating to 5 stars!  I've now visited The Old Fashioned a handful of times, and I love the place. The Old Fashioned has also found itself a spot on my personal \"must eat\" list for out-of-towners. My husband and I have taken his sister, some of my cousins, and my parents to The Old Fashioned when they've been in Madison visiting. We think it showcases Wisconsin food wonderfully, and we like taking non-Wisconsinites there to eat.  We've tried several different dishes and have enjoyed them all. I'm not even much of a beef eater, but the Wisconsin Burger is really to die for. (The egg on top? Yummy!!!)  Side note: stop by The Old Fashioned booth at the Taste of Madison to grab a handful of cheese curds! :-) I do this every year."}
{"text":"Delicious drinks.  Apple fritter puff...omg delicious, but share with a friend or four..."}
{"text":"The food and drink at The Old Fashioned never disappoints. The hand muddled old fashioned cocktails are excellent. All of the local food items that they use on the menu give you a true Wisconsin food experience.Be prepared for a wait to get a table, but that gives you time to enjoy another cocktail."}
{"text":"A trip to Madison would not be complete without a trip to The Old Fashioned! The burgers, Mac and cheese and cheese curds are quite lovely. Obviously the highlight of this restaurant is the menu of unique old fashioneds! I enjoy the apple old fashioned, but the traditional is also fabulous."}
{"text":"Came to town to teach a seminar and to work at the CrossFit Games. This place came highly recommended by a number of locals. Probably the bets burger I've had in a long time and the cheese curds were outstanding. Will be in town for another week and definitely gonna eat here again before I leave!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  Very good old fashioned's, as the name would imply. Fried fish combo was good. Good portion and nice mix. Fun bar food. Small sizes but you wouldn't want a lot of these. Turkey gizzards for example. Bacon mac and cheese was solid. Bacon taste was a little overpowering even tho I love bacon. Would like to try it without bacon. I would definitely return here and recommend."}
{"text":"I love the Old Fashioned for their breakfast brunch. Amazing food and a relaxed atmosphere. However, the parking situation leaves a lot to be desired. Be prepared to walk if you want to go to the Old Fashioned and be prepared to wait for a long time for a table. Their quality menu items makes them a highly desirable place."}
{"text":"Ever have an upscale bratwurst? Well, my friend, are you in for a treat. Pair it up with Wisconsin's staple cocktail, the Old Fashioned and you have yourself a great little bar/restaurant. The decor is super cool as well... I was impressed with the back wall behind the bar with all of the really sweet vintage beer signs and with the comfy leather booths. We were in here with a group for a nice relaxing dinner one night and then again a couple days later for some pre-wedding reception drinking and dice throwing. When you pop in here, you have to try the deep fried cheese curds, they are the best I've ever tasted. Easily one of the best additions to the capital square I've seen in years. Next time I'm back visiting my college town, the rumor is the walley sandwich can contend with the best Louisiana po' boy sandwich any day."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the Wisconsin classics, and aren't worried about feeling terrible and slow after you consume a ton of calories, then this is the spot for you.   The girlfriend and I were passing through Madison after attending a wedding way upstate, so we decided to pop in and stop for a late lunch.  The cheese curds here were some bring OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Oh man... Living and growing up in New England, I had never experienced anything like them before.  Just amazing texture and taste, so unreal how good these were.   I also had the burger and the lady got the grilled cheese, both quite good. Only reason why I knock 1 star off is the aftermath.  I'm not used to the Wisconsin cheese overload so I felt real lazy and slow afterwards. Overall a really great meal, but if you have a heart condition or are on a diet, you may want to look elsewhere due to the succulent nature of all the food here!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Definitely expect wait times on weekend evenings. However, if you love good beer selections and craft cocktails it is worth the wait. One of the best burgers in town."}
{"text":"What a fantastic little place! Just had time to fit in breakfast but wishing I could have gone back in the evening for the bar scene. The corned beef hash was amazing... but the apple fritter was as big as my head, and so delicious. It was crunchy and sweet. Perfect! Service was attentive and the food came out hot."}
{"text":"Food's pretty good, but  generally not worth the wait as this place gets very crowded. If you can get in, great, but if the wait is more than 20 min, move on as there are lots of nice places in the area."}
{"text":"8/10  Cheeseeeeeeeeeeeee curds. OMG. They are amazing. Make sure to get the paprika dipping sauce. I recommend getting one of their great burgers and substituting fries for cheese curds for an extra fee. They are absolutely amazing. First time trying cheese curds and Old fashioned did not disappoint. I was just so shocked as to how it maintains its chewy texture even at the end of the burger :)  Also their beer draft list is extensive.... Great burger and beer joint. I will come back again Madison!"}
{"text":"It's good but always very crowded. I think there are better fried cheese curds elsewhere. Seems a bit overrated to me."}
{"text":"My Husband, me, our daughter and a friend took a road trip to Madison we decided to have lunch at Old Fashioned because of all the great reviews. Maybe we had really high expectations but we were not very impressed. It wasn't bad but it was not spectacular either.   The outside of the restaurant is very cool looking and eye catching. The inside has the original hardwood floors which adds to aesthetics. Most of the decor fits with their theme but one thing that threw me off when we entered was the Chinese lanterns above the bar which were a little weird made me feel like I was in a Chinese restaurant.   The place was packed which was expected for a Sunday at brunch time but seeing little kids sitting at the Bar to eat is a little off putting I think the bar should be for adults only. We did not wait very long for seating which was nice. All of the staff was super friendly and they all had a smile.  They have a great beer list and their menu has a lot of options which. We ordered 2 bottled beers and a mimosa it took a while to get our drinks which was a little annoying. But we just let that one slide since it was so busy and our waiter was very nice.   My husband ordered the grilled cheese and the cheese curds. The cheese curds were very good but the grilled cheese was lacking because the cheese was not even fully melted. My daughter got the Chicken tenders from the kids menu. Let me tell you she loves chicken tenders but she barely ate them. She said she didn't really like them but she loved the fries. I got the old fashioned Burger and it was ok it's supposed to be their signature burger but it wasn't bursting with flavor which I had expected, the fries were very good they were crispy and fried perfectly. Our friend order the sausage and for her side she got the homemade potato salads which I tried a bit of and it was spiced just right and had a lot of flavor. She said her sausage sandwich was good I didn't try it.  Overall not super impressed with their food it was average in my opinion. They have the sides down pat but their main components are lacking. Not sure we would return."}
{"text":"Being a smug Minnesotan like I am, Wisconsin food falls into one of those quaint curiosities. \"Cheese curds along side of your hamburger? That's just crazy.\" \"Pickled eggs? How cute!\" Yet I had to change my tune after a recent weekend in Madison.  I'll start by saying that I am jumping-up-and-down-on-Oprah's-couch-in-love with The Old Fashioned. You Madison types ought to hold onto that one - it's a keeper! I wish that we had something even half that awesome in Minneapolis, so embrace and cherish it.  Let's start with the taps. 28! 28 different taps, all priced at or below $4. That is simply incredible. It's a nicely thought-out list, at that and one that I expect changes a fair bit. The bottle list comes in at a hefty 140 bottles and nothing priced above $6 - also impressive. I'm also tickled that Grain Belt is their sole \"import\".  I was equally impressed with the food. Between the two of us, my husband and I tried the beer and cheese soup (complete with popcorn!) that was rich, hearty, and thankfully not the least bit gluey; the cheese curds with smoked paprika aioli (a welcome twist); the house-made beef jerky (tougher than expected, but beautifully seasoned), and the Sunday night chicken dinner. Everything was well-executed and earnest. Prices were astonishingly low for the portion sizes and the quality of the food.  After spending an afternoon partaking in such time-honored Sconnie food traditions, I have a new-found respect for them. Let there be peace between our people."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE OLD FASHIONED! My favorite burger in the world is The Old Fashioned burger, with a beautiful over-easy fried egg on top. You just can't beat it! Plus their fried cheese curds are probably the best in Madison - so fresh, and the batter is perfectly light and crispy. The BF loves the drink selection too. I've only ever had great service, and the food comes out very quickly, sometimes shockingly so! This is a great place to go for lunch on a Farmers Market day - go put your name in early and they'll call you when your table is ready. Just make sure you can get back before they give your table away! Overall, I absolutely recommend The Old Fashioned to anyone who loves burgers and other American fare!"}
{"text":"Wanted a great place to dine after a 3 hr drive and this place comes highly recommended! Had to wait 45 mins for a table and gluttony got the better of us!  Shared a chilli bowl, Lazy Susan platter, fish-fry Friday and the old fashioned house burger between the missus and I and we were not disappointed. Had our taste buds and stomach satisfied with some to take back!   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty cool. Its really close to the capitol bldg.  and theFish fry, Fried cheese curds and Honey bock beer that I ordered were all pretty good. I would definitely come back to this spot next time im in Madison. Check it out!"}
{"text":"It's really about a 3 1/2 star.   Uo walked in, and it was just starting to get into their evening rush, so I sat at the bar.  I was told to try the fried cheese curds, and they were surprisingly good with the spanish paprika sauce. I ordered the spicy burger medium, it came out well done and hardly any jalapenos on it. Very disappointing, I don't know how a cook could get that oh so wrong. Not the worst burger I've had, but barely even a \"good\" burger. Coming from the south, maybe we just make them better.  The bartender suggested a really good amber style beer, wish I could remember the name. Then I switched to the old fashioned. Got a regular one first, which was surprisingly sweet. Then got one with rye and told the bartender not to make it so sweet, it was a little better.   It was nice seeing whom I suspect was a manager helping out the staff. I was, however, surprised that he did not go around and see how the customers are doing.  If I'm ever in town again, I may give it another try."}
{"text":"The most overrated place in Madison. Go there once to say you did and then never again. Great list of taps, any booze you want really but as a restaurant it is slow for seating and serving and has really unimpressive food. Always busy on a Friday night, just go somewhere else with better food."}
{"text":"This place was sooo good! I would definitely recommend getting a cheese plate as a starter (ask your waiter for a recommendation based on your tastes). The cheese curds are amazing and so are the burgers and the bacon mac and cheese. You can't go wrong getting something with cheese off the menu here!"}
{"text":"We love The Old Fashioned! Great spot, friendly staff, and good food. Yummy fried cheese curds, and the wedge salad is ginormous. Definitely one of our favorite go-to spots!"}
{"text":"Im in good 'ol Madison visiting family and was taken to the old fashioned. Of course I had to try the signature drink - the old fashioned which is a brandy based cocktail with some orange slices and a maraschino cherry. It's sweet and really allows the flavor of the brandy to come through. I currently have have an appetite that makes all-you-can-eat buffet owners cringe and at TOF I got soup, (1/2) salad and a sandwich w/ salad on the side. My pulled pork sandwich was tasty with the sweet relish inside. It wasn't dripping with overpowering bbq sauce - a big plus. Itjust wasn't enough to fill me up and i'm glad I got the other two dishes.  Overall I'd say the old fashioned is a big notch above pub grub but the menu which is heavy on the sandwiches and light on full plates of food leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"It's a shame they became so popular.  They lost the charm of being an Up Nort Supper Club."}
{"text":"Others have said it better and more loquaciously then I likely will so let me summarize:  An order of cheese curds, the Old Fashioned Burger with onion strings on the side and a solid beer of your choosing (perhaps a great local like Spotted Cow) is like getting punched in the mouth by a big thug named Delicious. A Mack Truck full of flavor is going to run you down like a dog, then back up over you to make sure that you can't eat or drink anymore because you're SO satiated.   Maybe I exaggerate. Maybe."}
{"text":"Great bar food on at the Capital. My wife and I got in at just the right time before the Friday dinner rush came by. I had the old fashioned burger which came done medium as I asked (which is not common) with large slabs of bacon and a sunny side up egg.  Very tasty. The cheese curds with tiger sauce were awesome too. The horseradish kick of the tiger sauce was a perfect compliment to the deep fried cheesy goodness.   My wife had the traditional old fashioned to drink which I tasted.  It was the perfect classic Wisconsin brandy old fashioned.  I tried the door county cherry old fashioned, which was good, but not at all sweet. It was tart from the cherry and made with a good whiskey.   We'll be back again.  It would be a great spot for a group of friends."}
{"text":"Ok - so I have lived in Madison a year and the Old Fashioned has been on my list of places to try.  Then it happens twice in one weekend!  Thank goodness they live up to their name.  Any kind of old fashioned drink done anyway with any kind of booze.  They also have Brandy slush.  This drink is amazing.  My only complaint?  The large is only the size of a pint and $7.50.  Really?  There are other nearly all booze drinks for 2-3 dollars less.    They are famous for their mac and cheese, sadly I did not order it.  I was at a Bachelorette party and felt grease was better to start my night.  I ordered their Wisconsin Burger.  Yes.  It was awesome.  What do they put in it?  It was cooked well but still juicy and flavorful.  The burger is large.  I like the option that you can have fries or a green salad without any additional charge.  One of my dinnermates ordered the mac and cheese.  I was constantly starting at it.  I had no self control.  I was being an eye voyeur on everyone else's plate.  Ok - I intend to go back.  I am trying to find an excuse...give me a reason Yelp!  The prices and the wait are the only thing holding you back from 5 stars.  Add reservations please!  I was in a party of 11 and we still had to wait."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. We came on a Friday night so we had to wait a bit but totally worth it. We had the mac n cheese and fish fry - so so good!!! We'd come back in a heartbeat. The service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Thanks to multiple suggestions, The Old Fashioned was one of the first restaurants I tried after moving to Madison and it certainly set the bar high. Any beer your heart desires, ridiculously delicious fried cheese curds, heart-warmingly friendly service, and a sweet view of the Capitol to boot...Isn't that what Madison is all about?  I overdid it on the cheese curds and beer (\"nothing in moderation\" was my motto that night), but judging from the little bit I could manage, the dinner fare was also delicious.  If you're going to eat at one place in Madison, this should be it. It's a classic!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service sucked.  Waiter never checked back with us.  Had to ask for the check.  Our friends were seated after us and got their food before we were asked for our order, finished their food before we were served ours, and were tabbed out and leaving when our food arrived.  Never cleared our dirty dishes or refilled our empty waters."}
{"text":"Loved it!! Wisconsin Benedict was very flavorful, usually I add salt, pepper and hot sauce to dishes didn't need that for this dish. My daughter had the chicken fried steak also very good. We shared a 1/4 apple fritter, it was good but would've been better warmed up. Coffee was weak. Be forewarned, Portions are huge!! Service and ambiance perfect!!! Definitely recommend to anyone visiting Madison!!"}
{"text":"If you're a breakfast fan, and I think that most people are, then look no further! The Old Fashioned in Madison is a fantastic restaurant! With a charming nostalgic atmosphere, and delicious food, this place is \"The Place\" to be.   Located right within eyesight of the beautiful capitol, this restaurant offers some beautiful views in the summer, and even better food and service. The food was quick, and delicious! I ordered the Eggs Benedict which was perfectly concocted, and a great portion size as well!  While eating at a nearby restaurant the night before, the evening fare also looked delicious! If you are in the area, I would highly recommend this place! Great food, service and prices!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I live here but I can't see what the big deal is about The Old Fashioned.  The food IS good but is it really two-hour-wait good?  Cheese curds: tasty but soaked in oil.  I can't eat more than a few before I get a stomachache.  The specials are meh,  the beer list is awesome  and the service is touch-and-go.  Verdict: Come here if you've got a few hours to kill."}
{"text":"I ordered two numbers from their brunch menu: Walleye and Eggs and Belgian Waffle with Wisconsin Seasonal Fruit. The foods tasted really fresh and had a homemade-style quality, and there was a lot of it on my plate. Although overall it was delicious, the food could have used a bit more seasoning. I found the walleye fish lacking in flavor in its flour batter; I usually don't use the paired tartar sauce when there's lemon to be squeezed but it had to be used. The fish itself was generously large and cooked to the right consistency. The scrambled eggs (four eggs probably cracked open) and cubed Russet potatoes were plentiful--I just needed to dust some black pepper over them. The Belgian waffle had a soft and light texture in the inside and an outside that could be more crispy. It was served with a small dollop of whipped cream, two individually-wrapped squares of butter, and warmed maple syrup. The waffle probably didn't need the apricots and blueberries that were an extra couple bucks.  Typical of any popular and good eatery, my friends and I waited a bit to be seated and for our food to arrive at our table. But at least they kept to their estimated maximum wait time. On one night, for instance, they quoted a longer wait when in actuality we could've had a table in a much shorter time had we not ate at Samba Brazilian Grill. On another day, they seated us within 10 minutes in the much quieter second level."}
{"text":"Wide variety of food- everything is very good. Reasonable prices and a great beer list."}
{"text":"The hipster's guide to Wisconsin supper clubs.  But seriously, this place is awesome.  Meat and cheese platters, hamburgers with eggs, apple pie with sharp cheddar cheese, the most delicious salmon salad and wood-grilled chicken sandwich, and an award winning old fashioned (or so I've been told).    Expect to wait for brunch and dinner (especially on Friday night or the weekends).  There have been many a time we've walked away because we need to eat now, not wait 30 minutes to be seated.     The staff have always been professional and friendly.  The restaurant is well kept and keeping busy having expanded their size over the last couple of years.   When co-workers, friends or family travel to Madison, The Old Fashioned is one place I always recommend."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is perhaps the best fish fry in Dane County. The cod is flaky and fresh without the grease or fish smell. Even the fries were somehow really good.   The bar is giant and the service is decent. I can't speak to the rest of their menu, but the Friday fish fry is worth the wait and worthy of the acclaim. Better still, the prices are terrific for downtown Madison and the portions are huge (two people could easily split the $10 Friday cod). Unfortunately this place is no secret and they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Stellar local beer list, with flights a plenty!  There are two pages of beers with a bizarre rule that flights can only be ordered from one page or the other.  Not to worry, just order a flight from each.  Served on WI shaped wood trays, they add a nice amount of kitsch.  Being in the cheesehead state, we had to go big or go home on the dairy, so we started with the Glacial plate, a tasty trio paired with a cherry jam, walnuts and crackers.  The pickled egg was super spicy and super rubbery.  Do not attempt.  Next up was the prime rib sandwich, which we mistakenly thought was going to be an actual piece of prime rib versus the mish mash of leftover, loose meat pieces of last night's roast.  Housemade cheese curds exploded into a slightly soggy mess, but fried cheese is fried cheese, and pretty good regardless.  Then, the Norwegian salmon salad, which smelled too fishy for my taste.  Served with an overcooked, rubbery, deviled egg and a tarragon vinaigrette, it left more to be desired.  Going back to another flight for dessert, we rolled out of Madison with full bellies.  The Old Fashioned is a place for cheese and beer, but dinner can be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Be still my midwestern traveling heart!  Cheese plate #1 with white cheddar, truffle sheep and Gouda.  #idie Build your own Old Fashion -- had this not been a lunch stop, I would stayed the night!  Great service, cool spot."}
{"text":"Cheese curds are amazing!  Bacon Mac and cheese is very very good has a little bit of beer cheese taste.  Pork shank sandwich and cheese plates are also recommended."}
{"text":"Good, solid brunch.  Selection is bigger than most brunch menus I've pored over and the coffee is excellent. I had one of their scrambles - which is supposed to be their pseudo omelette - with a side of bacon. The seasoned potatoes on the side were lukewarm and dry, but they weren't supposed to be the star of the plate anyway, so it didn't bother me. Everything was done quickly, despite the fact that the joint was packed to the gills with a mixed crowd of gay couples, college students, middle aged folks and families. Service was brusque but not unfriendly. Prices were more than reasonable. I'd love to go back to see how they rock lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"This place was packed when I arrived, so I settled for a place at the bar and ordered their prime rib sandwich.  Wait, that's not true. I also tried the cheese soup but sent it back because it was not a taste that I could stomach. I think you have to be from Wisconsin to appreciate that dish. The prime rib was good, and I would consider returning here to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"OooHhhhhahhhh the fried cheese curd. So wrong yet so yummy. I fell in love with it eating at The Old Fashioned. You simply can't just eat one. Take the plate away from me !!!!  I had the hamburger as well when I was there. The meat is so tender. One almost think you are dining at Ruth's Chris.   To top it all I think it is a very reasonable price to dine in downtown Madison"}
{"text":"The cheese curds were incredibly flavorful but were way too greasy (and I don't mind some grease)."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends and had a great time.  It was a busy place on a Saturday night in downtown Madison, Wisconsin right on Capital square.  We waited just shy of an hour for a table with no reservations.  That was ok with us though because we got an opportunity to have a few drinks at the bar and conversate.  Food was great as always, place was jamming, had a beautiful window seat looking up at the capital. We will be back!"}
{"text":"After a long drive to Madison from KC, this was exactly what I needed. Something to immediately make me feel like I had arrived in Wisconsin. It was a Wednesday and we had to wait about 20 minutes - no problem, just an opportunity to try some Wisconsin beer at the bar. When we got our table we were sitting next to the front window with the well lit capital right across the street. I did the walleye with cheese curds, both were excellent, and to drink; I switched to Old Fashioned's.  Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Kelli was awesome accommodating thoughtful server. Food was fun. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Friendly Service, Great Atmosphere and Cool Vibe.  I went here for dinner while in Madison and must say I was impressed. The bar was busy for a Tuesday night but any good bar is busy all the time.    I sat at the Bar as I was dining alone. I order an old fashioned and cheese curds. I turned around for 5 minutes and bang the cheese curds were there.  They were crispy and hot. They came with an aioli I would have preferred mustard but they were good.   I also order the Brat Sandwich. Two Brats on a  role with onion pickle and mustard. The Brats were hot and juicy. The roll was nice soft interior and crusty outside. Mustard was pleasant not overpowering and just enough kick.  The only complaint was the slice of onion was the whole slice. They could just put a few of the rings on the sandwich, good thing I wasn't on a date.   I was impressed the Bartender was making actual lemon twist for cocktails. Peeling back just a piece of the rind instead of just using precut wedges. The old fashioned was delightful. Not overly sweet as some places can do. It was garnished with a cherry and orange slice. It was so good I ordered two."}
{"text":"We had a great time here, but waited almost an hour on a Thursday night. Time to maybe expand?? The outdoor seating is only four tables and the patrons sat and sat and sat as we were waiting on a beautiful night. No eating, no drinking... frustrating. BUT, we finally were seated. It's loud in there so be prepared.  Ordered drinks. My Klisch (which I have had numerous times at the brewery and at home) had lemon in it which it does not normally. But my brother's hard lemonade was good. They have tons of beers on tap and will make whatever you'd like. Hubs is gluten-free and they were out of New Grist, but offered cider or something else.   On to dinner. Ordered the tuna salad on heirloom tomatoes w./ fried cheese curds. Fantastic and not at all breaded -- lightly floured so the buttery goodness was melting in the mouth. Brother dear had a wedge salad and hubs had a salmon salad w./ tarragon dressing to die for. They had signature old fashioned and i had a perfect manhattan (too dry, but that's ok). Parking was interesting... but we'll be back w/ my folks in the middle of the day to avoid the noise (they are old) and easier parking."}
{"text":"My husband and I are Wisconsin natives living in California, and when we go back to visit, one of the things we look forward to is eating some good old fashioned Wisconsin comfort food. With that in mind, we ate at The Old Fashioned on a Sunday night. We arrived at around 7:30, and the place was bustling, but the wait for a table was brief - lucky us! Our only regret as we read the menu was that there were only two of us. If we'd been in a larger group, we could have sampled more of the yummy sounding dishes.  We ordered two salads to share, and the waiter offered to bring them to us on four plates so we wouldn't have to divide the salads ourselves. Good call! The Spinach and Stravecchio cheese salad with shaved red onion, sunflower seeds, croutons, deviled egg and hot bacon dressing was superb. The other salad with Door County cherries, blue cheese and spring greens was good but not great. Someone in the kitchen forgot the brandy vinaigrette (this was promptly corrected). My husband had whole rainbow trout with fresh thyme, baby spinach and house pickled beets tossed with white wine vinaigrette, which he said was very good. I'm not a trout fan, so I'll take his word on that.   I had the Sunday night special, Scandinavian Style Chicken Dinner, which consisted of a half chicken on the bone rubbed with cinnamon, juniper and cardamom, and served with sausage & currant dressing, smashed red bliss potatoes, buttered parsnips and carrots. Soooo good! The chicken was moist, and the sausage & currant dressing was some of the best I've ever had anywhere. I don't eat chicken skin, but if you do, be forewarned that the skin on mine was not brown and crispy, even though the description said it was grilled over an open fire. It tasted more like roasted chicken than grilled, but it was still very good.  We had a couple of Old Fashioneds, and I highly recommend the Applejack Old Fashioned made with Madison's own Yahara Bay Apple Brandy. It was deeeeelicious! I really wanted to try the Orange Rum Old Fashioned, but they were out of the rum. Oh well, maybe next time."}
{"text":"I was in Madison for work recently and ate at the Old Fashioned after my shuttle driver recommended it. I was not disappointed.  I had dinner one night with my parents and brother who had driven up from Milwaukee and everyone enjoyed it.  Then, I had Saturday brunch with my other brother and it was downright remarkable. Don't bother waiting for a table. Sit at the bar and soak up the kitsch."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  I think the salads are the only non-alcoholic thing I've had here, but I just get an overall good feeling when I'm here."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Love this place, and yes, what took me so long?  As a Madison resident, many friends were surprised that I had never been here.  I am too.   Crowded Saturday night a couple of weeks ago.  Told about a 30 minute wait.  No problem, we found a spot at the bar and ordered, of course a couple of old fashioneds.  Delicious and made quickly and expertly in front of us.  Barely had time to settle up and we were buzzed via text messge(fancy) that a table was ready.   Sat in the newer part, and I need to start bringing my reader-cheaters, as I struggled to read the menu.  However, not a problem as Yelp reviews had let me know what to order; and we were NOT disappointed. Starter, of course with the cheese curds.  Amazing!  Light(possible?) for curds and perfectly melty.  We both had burgers.  She the Wisconsin and greatly enjoyed it and I the Old fashioned burger.  Both stood up to previous reviews, and I'm excited to go back; but not sure if stay with burger, or try many of the other wonderful looking items.  Enjoyed a couple of beers, from their broad selection.  A new favorite!"}
{"text":"This past Saturday (2/20/2016), I had the pleasure of eating at The Old Fashion in Madison. Unfortunately, I had the misfortune of interacting with the a few select members of their waitstaff.   While I waited with the rest of my party for our table to be called, we found an open area in the back by the stairs leading upstairs. We stood and talked amongst ourselves with our drinks, but noticed quickly that we were drawing the scorn of a 5'4\" waitress who was working a section of tables near the back bar. (for management: she had shoulder length, light brown hair, with part pulled into a pony and part of her hair hanging down to her shoulders. She has distinct horn rim glasses.) Assuming that it wasn't intentional we continued to talk, until she inserted herself directly in our conversation and very angrily declared that \"You can't stand here. There's usually a table. You guys need to move.\" I pointed out that we were just trying to stay out of the aisle, and if there was usually a table, was there harm in us standing there taking up that same space? She was having none of it.   We moved to avoid a scene - which she seemed ready to create - and watched another group fill the space moments later. At which point the waitress returned and doled out another scolding, this time even more unpleasant. When the group simply chose to ignore such a poorly framed request she proceeded to loudly complain to another waitress about how she was so sick of people getting in her way. The fellow waitress agreed that these customers were a real inconvenience. She proceeded to continually go out of her way to walk through the group (which was not in a main walkway, and passive aggressively let them know that there was usually a table where they stood.)   To top off the night, when we were waiting for our bill we got one last interaction with the original waitress who was so disgruntled about where we chose to stand: she very dryly, and sarcastically stopped at our table and said \"have a great night!\" with two big thumbs up. We wished her the same, and watched her dart across the room to clearly point at us with another waitress, and laugh and roll her eyes.  We were fortunate to have a far more friendly waiter, who was cordial and available for our entire meal. But if a restaurant chooses to fill empty tables as slow as molasses in the middle of February, I would hope that the least the employees could do is understand that patrons will stand around talking; enjoying their drinks, while they wait for a table.   It seems that this simple courtesy was too much to bear for some of the crew at The Old Fashioned. Next time I'm on the square and someone suggests TOF I'll make a point to offer many alternatives, so as to not burden anyone like I did this past weekend."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Not only do they have a HUGE selection of brews, but have amazing food. Sometimes the wait time can be a bit long but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I like trying unique eats when I can find them. When I told my client he recommended The Old Fashioned specifically for the deep-fried cheese curds.   They were delicious...months later now but I think there was a rich horse radish dipping sauce.   Had walleye as my entree as I'd never had it before. Tasty and prepared perfectly   Local beer on draft. Gotta support brewers fighting the good fight against AB-InBev.   Recommended."}
{"text":"This place recommended by our hotel staff. Def a popular spot, so expect a 30-40 min wait.  Good news is they have a text notification method, so you are not chained to the front door.  There is a nice area across the street to sit so we didn't mind.  Dark and Stormy drink that they have on tap was interesting.  Kinda sickly sweet and strong.  Margarita was perfect.  Got the cheese curds - nice selection of different dips.  I recommend the chipotle.  Hub ordered mac n' cheese with bacon - was very rich but DELISH!!  I got the Walleye sandwich and that was good as well.  Service was excellent - our water glasses were continually filled which was nice.  Wish we could have tried other things on the menu (we saw a lot of good stuff being served to other tables).    Def recommend!!!"}
{"text":"A unique Wisconsin fish fry experience. The bar tenders are top notch. Food is great and generous portions."}
{"text":"Was there today and the staff made it a pretty miserable experience.    First of all, the food is overpriced and just okay.  Ten dollars for a turkey sandwich and some leaves that didn't do much for me.    But the service was atrocious.  The waiter couldn't have been less interested in his job.  I drank two Arnold Palmers and asked for a third; the third time, he seemed like I'd asked him for a kidney, and said \"we don't refill those.\"  So I could have had 10 diet cokes (or 10 iced teas for that matter) but not another Arnold Palmer?    Second, I had a fifth member of the party join us late.  The waiter advised us to take a chair from a different table.  An old friend sits down and we're getting caught up when the manager comes and makes a huge fuss over it.  If I'm conscientious and ask for permission for something like that, I'm expecting not to get admonished for it ten minutes later.  As we were nearly done with our meal anyway, the manager should have let it go.    Waiter capped it off by twice forgetting a \"to go\" box, forcing another member of my party to simply give up on bringing their food home."}
{"text":"I live in Madison and there are so many other options that would blow this place out of the water! They have a cool name and are slinging average Wisconsin fare. The atmosphere is historic with exposed brick, high ceilings and deep wood work. We had the cheese curds and they were a complete grease basket - we had to dab them off on napkins. However, the dipping sauce options were choice. The Bloody Mary's lacked flavor but did have good garnish sides. If you are visiting Madison, go some place amazing -this is not it.  I want this place to succeed and up their food quality game!"}
{"text":"Loved the old fashioned cocktail options, the cheese-and-meats-filled menu, and the prompt service, even though it was clear our waiter was in the weeds. The cheese curds with paprika sauce were great, as well. Wasn't a big fan of the beer & cheese soup, but my chili dog was great! My friend who lived in WI said that this place is a bit of a tourist trap, but it was definitely a decent meal filled with WI culinary favorites."}
{"text":"Homey brew pub right across from the Capitol! Right in the square, what a nice place to get feel the WI L.O.V.E. They've got a good variety of local and belgiums on tap and lots of bottles of the same. I mean, it's WI after all. And, it's a college town. Oh, and they've got some creative Old Fashioned's!   Dark woods, a long bar, and friendly smiles great ya once you walk in. The menu's simple - sandwiches, burgers, and salads. It's all pretty fresh and healthier sides and options are offered. But, healthy, shmealthy, you have to try the fried cheese curds and paprika potato chips!   Metered 2 hour parking is a bit limited but be sure to find it vs. the 25 min. parking! You will quickly get towed if you're not careful.  Prices aren't bad for the drinks but would say that it's a bit high for the food. The portions are big though so they make up for it that way.   After your done, walk across the street to the Capitol building for a self-tour!"}
{"text":"The food is too salty. The menu is boring. The service is terrible."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has a great Wisconsin beer selection.   The Ale Asylum was very smooth.   The cheese curds where some of the best I have had and were perfect with the brats!   Well  worth checking out.   There are several parking garages were close by!"}
{"text":"Great WI beer selection on tap. All the food is tasty. Have been here many times. Never disappointed. Good fish fry, but be prepared to wait. No problem if you like beer or old fashions!"}
{"text":"This is only for breakfast. I went to Madison to visit friends and get to game (a yearly occurence); after the Farmer's Market I came over here to grab a bite and sat at the bar. My Wisconsin half is out of practice, because while I was instinctively drawn to the amazing all Wisconsin beer list, I couldn't pull the trigger on drinking beer for breakfast. I had the Wisconsin Benedict, absolutely fantastic. The menu looked so good I couldn't really decide, so instead I came back the next day and had a great slab of walleye for breakfast. HEAVEN! The second day I had the All Wisconsin Bloody Mary. Generally I'm not BM fan, but this thing, with its local jerky,cheese, and pickled egg garnish was just too amazing looking to pass up. Yeah, a bit expensive, but I had to try it. Since I've left Wisconsin I've mostly lived in Boston and San Francisco, so I'm always in a state of shock at how cheap everything is in this state, but the prices were great. I'd be paying $5-8 more where I live for anything close to this. Not cheap for Madison or Wisconsin, but damn good."}
{"text":"Good food.  Service at lunch was no what was expected.  When you go to a place to sit and wait in line to sit and eat, you expect service.   Unfortunately for lunch it lacks luster.  Pay at the counter, with tip, then wait to see how things go.  The food was good, Had a pork sandwich that was good, but had soggy corners.  My friend had the turkey but said it was good however his salad side didn't have much dressing.  Without q server no one to really tell the fires and sand which were soggy.       Usually a great place but I would avoid the lunch hour."}
{"text":"We only had drinks at The Old Fashion but it was a fantastic experience. Our bar tender was great and made my new favorite drink. He heated up a snifter glass with boiling water and dumped it. He then put in Grand Marnier and St Germaine (1:1) and put in a twisted lemon peel. Incredible."}
{"text":"Short and sweet, because sometimes it's just what you want.  Reasons to love The Old Fashioned: #1: the name....it automatically transports you in a homey and warm atmosphere where you nurse a favorite drink without a care in the world.  #2: the location. You are in the shadow of power, kids. The Capitol is watching you. More importantly, you are watching it.  #3: the prices. $2.50 for a glorious pint of New Glarus Oktoberfest? Don't mind if I do. And do it again. No suds on tap above $4. That's enough for me to become a full-time 'Sconnie. And all the booze is strictly local. You didn't even imagine they had that much.  #4: the food. Everything is made in the land of dairy. EVERYTHING. Be ready for cheese, summer sausage, beer soup and the like. Also: you can have cheese curds as a side for your sandwich. A side of cheese curds. I mean.... Also: burger with bacon strips and a fried egg to double the pleasure when you had to miss breakfast. Pretty fab'.  #5: the atmosphere. Wood galore, kitschy paintings, tin ceiling, vintage lighting and silly signs. If these are your things, this is your place.  #6: the hours. Opens at the crack of dawn, closes at 2 am 4 nights a week. That's love."}
{"text":"Stalwart \"Wisconsin-y\" restaurant. LONG wait times so try to get there early - last time I went, it was 2 hours. Lots of fried food and cheese, nothing too sophisticated, but tasty!"}
{"text":"YUM! This place smelled of delicious meats and cheeses. We were in visiting Madison and I found this place on doing a yelp search. Oh man it was really tasty. Awesome beer list, happy to try some native brews. We had the crackers and wisconsin cheese dips for an appetizer, it was super tasty. I had a delicious veggie sandwich with eggplant, red peppers, and goat cheese (#4 or 35 maybe) and my husband had some crazy burger with an egg and all kinds of stuff on it. The kids had mac n cheese, totally decadent and thick, and salmon, good but on the small side. We were too stuffed for dessert. I like the atmosphere and the waitresses were wonderful. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We went to the old fashioned for the first time on Friday for dinner.  It was busy and loud, but the service was really good. We started off with the cheese curds (they are a must have) I had the walleye dinner which was just alright (but pricey). The frys that came with it were good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Great Wisconsin style cheese curds and old fashioneds. Their staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is great. Love it for brunch or late night appetizers and drinks. The bloody's are also great and they usually have one with ingredients from the farmer's market across the street. You can't go wrong here for a true Wisconsin style meal."}
{"text":"Too much good food to talk about! Well, I'll try to at least /start/: This time I had the beef jerky and a fresh, green salad before digging into the mac and cheese, which was probably amongst the top 2 or 3 \"gourmet\" mac and cheeses I've had in my life."}
{"text":"Really crowded but fun.  Ate at the bar and had the obligatory cheese plates and bratwursts.  Felt like a true midwesterner.  Lots of great beer, especially new glarus.  Unfortunately, I didnt get the cheese curds that everyone told me to get.  Ill have to come back and give them a try."}
{"text":"The best cheese curds! The service is great and family friendly. The old fashioned burger was delicious. The beer cheddar soup was great as well."}
{"text":"The cheese curds are fantastic and are a must-order item on the menu.  Their menu has relatively few vegetarian options compared to other nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"Three star reviews are probably the least exciting reviews to read.  The place is okay  Cheese curds are good.  Sausage plate is good.  The Old Fashioned are surprisingly *meh*.    If you like standing in line for a long time waiting for a place to sit in a hot and crowded place, you'll love The Old Fashioned.  Also if you're fan of noisy place where you'll have to scream in order for your table mates to hear you - you'll likely rate this place 5+ stars.   Personally, I like to converse.  i like it when my chair isn't slammed into by other patrons trying to get in and out of their chairs... so 3 stars feels generous.    If you go, try going during \"off hours.\"  You'll have a better time."}
{"text":"Heard good things about the place and came here.  Fries were very salty. Cheese cakes are not to my taste.... beer was good"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place especially after reading the reviews and a fellow Yelper recommending this spot.   Let me start off with the positives. The beer selection is on point with over 150 Wisconsin beers.  That part was by far the best part for me especially when the featured beer is $3 for a pint and mostly all the others are about $4-5 a pint.  You can definitely get boxed at a place like that.  Oh and the cheese curds with ranch was very good.  I also really liked the turn of century interior with the original floors and bar but the Asian lamps got to go over the bar. Edison bulbs would be much better.   Now on to the stuff I didn't care for...the server was very nice but slow to get bottled beer for my friend. But I'll just chalk that up to it being Sunday during brunch.  The other thing was my grilled cheese sounded great but the cheese was not melted at all... My wife ordered the burger which she said was bland and my daughter did not like her kids chicken meal.   But on the other hand our friend Tina loved the brat; I also had a small bite and enjoyed it.  So I would like to give this place one more try especially for the beer."}
{"text":"This place is a must try for anyone new to Madison, WI! The wait staff was definitely very friendly and service was nice! We were seated in the back room where it was kind of dark, intimate setting and there was a candle lit in the center of the table. It was cute! Eventually they opened their larger curtains in the front of the shop so that the back of the room was more lit! When we arrived on a Sunday morning, it was kind of crowded so we had to wait abit. But they had a text service which was really nice! I ran across the street with my friend to take some pictures in front of the capital building before we were texted that our table was ready! Definitely very nice.    I loved the fried cheese curds even though I'm lactose intolerant. I went with my friend and we ordered 1 order of fried cheese curds to share along with the wurst platter. The platter definitely had quite alot of variety of sausages to sample with pickled veggies and whole grain mustard as a dipping sauce. It was really good! and both myself and my friend were pretty full after sharing the platter and cheese curds. My friend ordered a beer but I did not sample it because I did not feel like drinking at that time.   Overall, I'd definitely want to come back here next time I visit Madison, WI! Food is great, service is good, and atmosphere is cozy!"}
{"text":"I hope you aren't in a hurry if you are coming here for a lunch during the week. My rating is mainly based off of the bad service from Laura our server she needs some serious attention to her attentiveness to her tables. We arrived at 11:30 on a Thursday and there were only 2 other tables we didn't have anyone come to our table for at least 15 minutes when there were at least 4 servers standing around towards the back. The table was nice by the window with a nice view of the capitol. We had the spicy burger and bratwurst and cheese curds and fries. The food was fairly good the fries were average and cheese curds were kind of chewy, I have had much better, the spicy burger could of had had more spice for my liking. We were at the restaurant for over and hour and a half due to Laura's lack of attentiveness, we had to go out and feed our meter several times because it took much longer than expected. The waitress only checked on us right after we got out food and barely had time to take a bite. We tried to wave her down and catch her eye when it got a little bit busier during the lunch hour so we could get our check, we piled up our plates, and finally another waiter came and asked us if we needed anything and made her get the check for us. Hopefully the other servers are better."}
{"text":"The old fashioned is one of those places that you want to hate because it seems so cliche- but you can't. In fact, every time you visit, you become a bigger fan.  Reasons to love it: * Cheese curds (and cheese platters) * Cocktails are amazing (and late night happy hour) and they have a ridiculous bar selection * Monthly beer specials (sometimes $4/pitcher) * Food is pretty solid * Great place to take out of town visitors - it's like Wisconsin in a restaurant *Late night happy hour - 1030-12 - two for one's  Some negatives- it gets packed really easily and sometimes you can wait a long time for a table, and also is a pretty tight space. They should get a little more space."}
{"text":"Great tap selection! Love the local brews. Food looks really good!"}
{"text":"I don't think they have anything that isn't good . I've been here a few times and each time ordered something different, everything I've tried has been great. Try the cheesecurds!!!"}
{"text":"one of the best restaurants in town. casual atmosphere, great authentic WI cuisine done with a new (but not to hipster) flair. lived here 10 years and this is one of my favorite places in town. beware the wait, though. they don't take reservations and sometimes you'll have a long wait to get in. yea, they're popular."}
{"text":"I'd have to disgree with the previous reviews.  I ate lunch at The Old Fashioned Last week and I was frankly not impressed.  Basically this restaurant is just an upscale Culver's.  You order your food at the bar and they give you what appears to be a cow ear tag with a number on it.  It took over a half hour for my friend and I to get our lunches, and we actually had to ask a staff member what the hold up.  It was crowded, but how long can a burger and a bowl of soup take?  My friend ordered her cheeseburger medium and it came well done, and my soup and salad cost $12!!!  The pumpkin soup was good, but not stellar and the salad definitely wasn't worth 8 bucks.  The only nice thing is that you don't have to worry about a tip, so that helps to justify the prices.  All-in-all, I love the concept and will probably give it another shot for dinner, but I can't justify $12 for a mediocre lunch. 2 1/2 Stars."}
{"text":"We came in expecting decent bar snacks but were pleased to discover a genuinely tasty meal!  My boyfriend and I saw that The Old Fashioned was named one of the homes of the best cheese curds in Wisconsin. It did not disappoint. First of all, we came in on Saturday at 3pm, and even at an off-peak hour, the place was still full of people!! Right away, we ordered a serving of the cheese curds with the paprika dip and the garlic dip. I thought the paprika dip had a great tang to offset the richness of the curds.   We also had the walleye sandwich and the beet and blue cheese salad. The fried fish in the sandwich was incredible - flaky and just enough crisp, and also a great size! I thought the salad was a star!! I loved the sweetness of the pickled beets and the funkiness of the cheese. I also asked for dressing on the side, and didn't end up using any of it because I thought the salad was that good!! Everything was executed beyond my expectations."}
{"text":"I have only been to the Old Fashioned for breakfast, but Oh! what a breakfast it was! I ordered the veggie scramble that had the freshest and most flavorful  soft cheese mixed in.  The toast came with a cherry preserve that, had I not been dining with workmates, I would have asked if there was a vat I could go plunge into!  I t was heavenly, and from what I hear it is a local staple. he eggs and toast came with roasted potato slices that were savory and cooked to perfection.  If you are ordering this breakfast, make sure you have your comfy pants on because it is a huge plate of food!    The atmosphere is very cozy despite the 15' ceilings and the dining room was very clean.  Our server was sweet, speedy and responsive.  All in all, a great first visit."}
{"text":"While visiting Madison for the CrossFit Games, every uber driver recommended this restaurant so Saturday night we stopped in to try their beloved cheese curds. (FYI they're awesome and well worth the try.)  The restaurant scene in Madison isn't that open to reservations (unless it's a fine dining establishment) so the wait for a party of 10 on a Saturday around 7:30pm was a little over an hour. We were VERY fortunate that they figured out a table for us within 25 minutes!  As mentioned, their cheese curds were delicious! Their mac and cheese was also absolutely scrumptious. I should also mention that their portion sizes were generous. Every person in my party left with a very full stomach. The server (whose name escapes me) was attentive and easygoing, and when we asked for the bill he offered to split it up per person. I know this is a simple task but many servers and restaurants have policies against doing it. Overall it was a great experience. I would return if in Madison again and would recommend this place to others visiting there."}
{"text":"Not a ton of vegetarian options. All the food is very heavy. I ordered an omelet for breakfast one morning and their was so much boursin that it made me sick :("}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Madison. Can have a long wait though at times especially during peak times."}
{"text":"Long overdue review! Came here in February after a Pharmacy Legislative Day at the Capitol with some friends for an early dinner. I ordered the Spicy Burger (no bacon) and it was great! Perfectly cooked (medium-well) and the jalapenos are no joke. I would suggest asking for them on the side if you aren't sure how hot they are going to be.  The service was also great. Our group of 9 had two booths and the server was very kind and attentive. He checked in every so often and was a great resource for recommending food and drinks. I would definitely come back to this establishment."}
{"text":"I think I like the idea of this place more than the food. Everything looks and sounds delicious but is generally underwhelming. The burgers are okay, the mac and cheese isn't nearly as good as it looks, the brat plate is good but nothing I couldn't make myself, and the fries are only decent. This place is really popular so its hard to get a table, loud, and the service passable but not much more. If I do go back it would be to try the walleye sandwich at lunchtime. The drinks are good, especially the brandy old-fashioned that the restaurant is named after."}
{"text":"More hype than good food unless you are looking for a booze bar. The Mac and cheese was almost worth the 45 min wait but the rest of the food wasn't. Service friendly with a lot of college kids. Many looked like they should have been carded. Go back? Maybe. Wait?  No way.  Parking impossible."}
{"text":"Best place ever. Madison favorite. Could not live without. Thought these aforementioned things prior to trying their brunch. Omg. Brunch is amazing as well. Huge portions. So reasonably priced. Delicious coffee. Walleye and eggs?! Brat patty Benedict?! With rosemary/herb potatoes?! Come on now. I thought this place could have flaws. Foodwise, the place is perfect. The old fashioned burger with the egg on it, mmmmmm. The skinny fried onion app. The curds. Only room for improvement I can think of is their actual old fashioned cocktail beverage and their Bloody Mary beverage. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I think these two signature beverages could be better. Or maybe my vision of their beverages is unfairly skewed due to how much I love all their food, brunch, lunch, and dinner. Love this place. Xoxoxoxoxoxoxo."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu looked and sounded delicious! We ended up getting the prime rib sandwich and cheese curds. Sooo good. Service was good and Rebecca, our sever couldn't be sweeter."}
{"text":"Had the egg hamburger...pretty awesome. They're cheese curds are pretty delish!!! The old fashioned I had was excellent...maybe the best in WI...Pricey, but worth it and the location is amazeballs."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds I've had in my life! If in Madison, you have to try these. Coming from CA, I never understood the Midwest obsession with cheese curds till I had these. Also the Wednesday we went, they had the fish fry as a lunch special( normally only available on the weekends) which was very good. I don't drink but there were a lot of good looking old fashions to chose from; they did have root beer on tap which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a three-hour wait on weekends when there is a Badger game! So we left our number and continued a pub crawl. When they called back an hour later to tell us a table was ready, we were on the other end of the street and had just settled in with new drinks. How about a more accurate wait system?  The next day we did make it there for lunch and it was really good. But the cheese curds arrived after the entrees so it was massive amount to look at and eat at one time.  The CC were excellent though, just like everyone had advised!  My advise, promote the cooks and bartenders, have a little talk with your host staff and servers.  You need them all working in sync!"}
{"text":"was told this was one of THE spots to eat while visiting Madison--IT IS!!!  huge beer selection, and nice cocktail menu.  had the old fashioned, brandy sweet---excellent cocktail.  beer cheese soup very tasty.  had their house burger, excellent!!!  eggplant sandwich very good also.  had salad with my burger which had a brandy vinaigrette dressing.  tasty yet not overpowering of the greens.  service was attentive and helpful.  if in Madison, this is a very inexpensive yet high quality restaurant.  the house burger with a side was $9.95.  daily specials too!!!  cant beat price and quality"}
{"text":"A fun, touristy restaurant with a Wisconsin theme. The Old Fashioned, presumably named after the classic cocktail of America's dairyland, is in downtown Madison in the shadow of the state capitol building. Of course they feature Wisconsin craft brews, food and culture. Since I love the dairy state I knew we couldn't go wrong by stopping here as we passed through town. They had people lining up for tables when we arrived about 12:30 Friday afternoon and it got busier after we were seated. I love the refrigerated case below the front counter with cheese curds, horseradish, pickled eggs and other quirky local treats. The lunch menu is pretty short with burgers, sandwiches and salads. The food was just OK but it's the experience that's important in places like this. Plenty of retro WI decor and they offer t-shirts and souvenirs for the tourists. I was hoping they would have one with my favorite saying, \"Wisconsin...come smell our dairy-air!\" But I had no such luck."}
{"text":"The Wisconsin Bloody is to die for, and the food is always fantastic.  A bit crowded around dinner time on weekends, so go early to avoid a long wait."}
{"text":"I read Meghan Horvarth's review and I told myself that I would order the House Burger. It was a good decision. It has one of my favorite combination in the world: Bacon and sunny side up egg, both on top of a beautifully seasoned burger. Nicely toasted buns, it was pretty darn awesome!  However, I would not recommend the Brats platter on their menu, it doesn't worth it in my opinion. My friend and I ordered that because we were having Spotted Cow at the time, the delicious beer tried to trick us into thinking that the dish was worth it, but I was sober, so no chance of deceiving me on that.   The Cheese curd is pretty good, but a little bit greasy in my opinion.   One thing that was off about the restaurant was the flies. I waited for 20 mins or so to be seated right next to the window, I was congratulating myself on getting a good seat, then i heard buzzing. I thought it was my stomach, but it turned out to be a bunch of flies. Do not sit near the window. It's a trap!!!"}
{"text":"During a recent visit to Madison Wisconsin, me and some friends were a bit buzzed from the New Glares Bacon, Beer & Cheese Fest. We walked around the Capital building for a bit a bumped into this place that seemed very lively on a late Saturday afternoon. Walked inside and there was a bit of a wait so we grabbed some space at the bar for our group of 6...4 of us had to stand as there were 2 seats available. Since the place is called Old Fashioned, we assumed they made pretty good old fashioned cocktails. I went with the bourbon old fashioned which was pretty good. My buddy got an old fashioned with a boiled egg inside which I thought was quite interesting.  After maybe 20 minutes we were told me can have a seat as a table became open. I ordered the wood grilled chicken breast sandwich that came with bacon, swiss, mayo and dijon mustard on toasted bread....side of fries were included. Pretty good sandwich! Good spot to hit up when in Madison!"}
{"text":"A friendly Madisonian directed us here. We were touring the Capital building and it was just around the corner. A great place to stop by while touring the city.   A+ cheese curds and the beer selection will keep you here all day! We were also dying for some cheese, and this place has great cheese plates to choose from. We recommend the Lazy Susan for some deliciously pickled veggies and cheese spreads."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekend game day and got a seat right away for two. Ordered a flight of beer and a cheese plate.  Cheese was decent and the beer was amazing!  I would go again. My partner has been for drinks more than me and he's always enjoyed it.  Very family oriented"}
{"text":"Service was a little lacking at the bar, I think there may have been an issue with the POs system. Chicken fried steak was HUGE and really tasty.  The cheese curds may have saved me from a terrible hangover."}
{"text":"Pretty much a must-do if you're visiting beautiful Madison. I love that this place celebrates the state's culture, food and history. We got the sampler plate-- a lazy susan-- and my only regret was that we didn't have nearly enough room to finish that delicious, delicious cheese. Don't make my mistake: come hungry!  The namesake drink was reasonably good and affordably priced, especially given how much I have paid for old fashioneds in trendier bars and in larger cities. I stuck around for two or three.   Definitely worth a meal if you're  visiting Madison and want to tourist it up!"}
{"text":"Incredible burgers and cheese curds in a classic Wisconsin environment."}
{"text":"As iconic of a place you would be able to find in Madison Wi.  The cheese curds are by far the best you will ever have and are a must to those not from the area.  The burgers are tremendous and the selection of tap beers (not to mention the bloody mary) is fantastic.  Only draw back it is at times over the top crowded."}
{"text":"Been on several trips to Madison and The Old Fashioned has the best cheese curds I've had. They have an awesome beer selection, the environment is nice, and it's right on the Capitol. This seems like the logical spot for both tourists and locals to enjoy a great meal. I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nick was excellent!! We have visited before and have had a great time; good food and fun conversations!!! Wonderful drink menu and specials. Never had anything but great here!  Local folks from the area and folks like us from out of state can sit by the bar and share stories."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were very good.  Waitstaff was very attentive.  A little pricey for two people $50.  That was one  drink and a breakfast meal for each."}
{"text":"Whats not to like? Noisy fun place with a huge menu that has something for everyone. I like the fact that each selection has a number so there is no chance of a mistake. I had the walleye that was huge but with too much bread that I didn't eat. Lots of good beer and of course the Korbel Old fashion which the sign says they have served  over six hundred thousand of. Wow. Thats probably just to the locals too. Too sweet for me but good for a nice buzz. This place has been busy since the day they opened and I mean all day. People love this place for the food and the low cost of most everything. The bartenders are even nice and will chat you up while making four Old Fashions. It happened! Great Madison place that you shouldn't miss. Don't worry about the crowd and the wait, they move customers fast. and with a couple of drinks in you your leave with a smile on your face. Im the guy at the end of the bar with the goofy grin. You should probably avoid me if I'm singing."}
{"text":"Drinks are cheap, food is better than great pub food. Happy hour is the best. Can be crowded, so if you have a chance to get there early, do so."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fun, energetic, and always busy- a great place for groups or just getting a drink after work and feeling like you're really from Wisconsin/Madison.  Tap beer selection is enormous (25 or so to choose from, all from WI) and staff is very helpful.  Menu is large, full of sandwiches and burgers, but I really wouldn't stray too far from the cheesecurds, onion strings, soup, and burgers if you want to feel truly satisfied for the money you spend.    Happy Hour is good- 2-4-1 rails and taps- but get their early because it is only from 3-5pm.  Only time I was ever disappointed by the place (in the 30+ times I've been there) is when we got a cheese platter- the cheese was interesting, but for $13 i need a lot more than 3 slices of cheese, a few walnuts,  and 2 apple slices.   All in all, great any time of day for drinks or food!  watch out, though- they don't take reservations so weekends get crazy."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to go out for a nicer meal in Madison. It's super reasonably priced and the food never disappoints. Their salmon salad is to die for and of course you have to get fried cheese curds every time. They have awesome specials every night of the week and are always packed. It's a huge shame they don't take reservations because I often wait for at least an hour for a table, even on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Great food, I had the old fashioned burger, hands down the best burger I have ever eaten.  If you visit Madison this is a must on your places to eat.  Over 100 beers dozens of local beers on tap all only $2.25-$4 a pint.  Cheese curds are a must have as well.  Good local atmosphere, good service.  Small dining areas so it gets crowded, but 2 very large bars."}
{"text":"I've been to the Old Fashioned several times - dinner and lunch. Very fun menu and a creative, fresh take on the supper club theme. I would definitely skip the lunch - they have a very chaotic process for ordering. You are seated, and then have to order food and pay at the bar. When I went last week for lunch, we were initially seated at a window table, which would have been great if it hadn't been for about 10 flies flying around. Gross. We asked to be moved. We placed our order and paid at the bar and waited. And waited. And waited. Ultimately, we waited for an hour and a half for our food, which was medicore when it finally came. Turns out that the computer system went down shortly after they placed our order (and a few other patrons' orders) and they couldn't produce the food. However, they never came to tell us this, we had to seek them out after about 45 minutes. They never offered us appetizers or complimentary drinks. And, to top it off, people who were seated 45 minutes after us got their food before us and we got to enjoy watching them eat while our stomachs growled. Eventually, they decided to take our order again manually and the food arrived. It was frustrating because we had paid for everything up front, including the tip. I had to ask for a refund. When it came, it wasn't a full refund, but I didn't have the energy to try and point that out to them. Suffice it to say, it's unlikely I will go back."}
{"text":"Winner, winner, chicken dinner! The Sunday chicken dinner is delicious comfort food. The old-fashions are fantastic. The service is consistently good. It's a pretty restaurant in a nice location."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic night here, when all I was expecting was a decent dinner.  The sandwich and salad combinations all looked fantastic, but I ended up getting a salad with salmon and bacon on it.  No, it wasn't healthy, but that wasn't the point.  Amazing selection of beers made in Wisconsin, as well as some spirits made in Wisconsin.  Prices were very reasonable for the beer ($4 for a pint of craft beer?), and there was a great mixed drink selection.  I got the \"Old Fashioned\" with Death's Door Gin, and it was fantastic.  I look forward to going again.  Tons of space, two bars on the first floor, and more seating on the second floor.  We had to wait, but we grabbed a seat at the bar, and got some cheese curds and pickled eggs.  The wait was more than tolerable."}
{"text":"Such a great lunch place. Had the beef sandwich and it was absolutely amazing. The cheese curds here are the best, they remind me of the type you get at the fair, yum!"}
{"text":"I love the lazy susan appetizers to share and I cannot rave enough about the Walleye sandwich. It was unbelievable."}
{"text":"went here for lunch on a weekday.  It's counter-service only, so you order form the bar.  I ordered the buffalo chili and the beet salad.  Both were delicious!  My kids had the mac n cheese and they scarfed it down.  And obviously we had to order some cheese curds."}
{"text":"I just was there for lunch with friends. They are experimenting with the ordering process. You have to write down your order and bring it to the bar which was AWFUL. Additionally, this was very inefficient. The person in our group who went to the bar to order had to keep coming back to ask questions about our order (we weren't specific enough). I wish we had someone taking our order. Also, I felt that I didn't even need to tip (but I did - just not 20%) because there was a lack of service esp. if one of our group is doing the job of a waitress.  The food was good. I had a burger that was seasoned wonderfully, but it seemed small for the price. There are many different beers to make anyone happy."}
{"text":"This place was very busy and loud, so the atmosphere wasn't very enjoyable, but the food and service was great. The cheese curds were the best out of the four restaurants we tried them at, very fresh and all of varying sizes. The prime rib sandwich was great and the fruit crisp was delicious."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, friendly staff and great food. (The cheese curds are a must!)You do usually have to wait a while for a table, especially if it's a Friday/ Saturday night, but's it's so worth it."}
{"text":"Great cheese curds.  The menu does not have many vegetarian options, but the mac and cheese was quite tasty, and the salads are gigantic."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned possibly has the best Bloody Mary in Madison. I've tried quite a few at different Madison restaurants, but this one in particular is super flavorful and spicy and l, in my opinion, stands above the rest.   We visited The Old Fashioned for Saturday brunch. Despite farmer's market crowds, the wait for a table for 2 was only about 15 minutes. We chose to sit at the bar rather than wait, which also had plenty of empty seats.  The service was good, great beer and drink selection, and the menu features many local products and Wisconsin specialties. This is a really great place to take out-of-state friends to highlight Wisconsin's favorite foods and drinks.   The food was decent - I really enjoyed both their market vegetable benedict and the meat benedict (pork?). However, their breakfast potatoes are extremely bland and dense. I say bypass the potatoes and sub in a different breakfast side.  Seems like a great restaurant for any time of day."}
{"text":"We came here with my sister--in-law and her bf after her graduation, since she indicated this was one of the most popular restaurants in Madison.   The 4 stars is for food, and because I agree this is a must-visit to get the classic Wisconsin experience, but the service was definitely 2 stars (or less).   On weekdays at lunch, you order at the counter and then they bring your food out to you.  But they don't let you pay when you order, so you have to wait in a long line to order and then in another long line to pay.  They screwed up my sister-in-law's bf's order (they forgot the bacon on the burger but charged him for it) and so he asked if they could take the bacon off the bill - instead they brought out two sad-looking strips of bacon for him to eat on the side, which was not really what he wanted.   Then when all went to pay for our meals, they thought we had left the booth and began clearing it, including taking my fiance's sweatshirt and putting it in the lost-and-found.   When he realized he didn't have the sweatshirt, we asked about it and recovered it, but it just seems so weird to take it and put it in lost-and-found before people have left.  So why 4 stars?  Well the food was really good and definitely a unique experience.  I had the grilled cheese with a side of cheese curds (cheese with a side of cheese - when in WIsconsin, right?)  The cheese curds were fantastic and the sandwich was pretty good as well.  It came on really buttery Texas toast.  My fiance really enjoyed his prime rib sandwich as well and it came with decent, but not great, fries.  Portions were pretty hearty, although a bit pricey - most sandwiches were in the $9-$10 range, and adding cheese curds to them was $3.   I doubt I would be here regularly if I lived in Madison, but I do think it's a cool place to stop as an out of town guest."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in the State St. area.  Good drinks.  Above average pub food (with a wider range of alternatives).  And the cheese curds are basically the best in the city.  If you want to know what a fried cheese curd is supposed to taste like, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Nice amount of food but nothing had flavor, had chicken fried steak, over medium eggs, country potatoes and toast. All under seasoned and steak was dark hard and over cooked. Would not come back."}
{"text":"You might find better cheese curds in Manitowoc. But that's a subject of debate."}
{"text":"I went there once. The food was overpriced, underdelicious, and what I mostly remember was that it took FOREVER. It was brunch time on a Saturday morning, but even taking that into consideration, there's no reason it should have taken 15 minutes for me to get my coffee. If I remember correctly, my companion didn't even get her drink until asking the waitress several times."}
{"text":"I've lived in Madison for 3 years and finally went to The Old Fashioned this past weekend for Saturday brunch. The wait was surprisingly short (15 minutes) considering it's usually around 45 minutes to an hour, which is why I'd never eaten there before. My friend and I sat at the bar while we waited for a table. The restaurant was decorated for the holiday season and it was packed with families; everyone seemed to be having a great time and the ambience was very warm and cheerful. We were seated and our waiter was fairly quick to come by, but he never introduced himself and barely said a word throughout the meal which was uncomfortable. I ordered the ham and eggs because that's what the people at the table next to us had and it looked good. The brunch menu is pretty extensive and offers classic meals with a twist, like breakfast potatoes sauteed with rosemary (my favorite part of the meal). The food was pretty darn tasty and I would order it again. I'll definitely go back for dinner at some point."}
{"text":"Great place, but I enjoyed it better when it was smaller. Great beer list, fun food. An instant institution."}
{"text":"Visited this place on a Saturday night.  Awesome cherry old fashioned. I'd never had one before. Lots of different local beers, which was great. Friendly,  knowledgeable bartender. Quick prompt service. Will return if ever back in Madison!"}
{"text":"Beautiful bar. Not a great option for gluten free dining. Music wasn't really my style and bartender kept it really loud."}
{"text":"The food was very good, however, the service was below average.  We spent 15 minutes trying to locate our waiter to receive our checks only to have everything incorrectly split. With all of the other great food options around, I would probably go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer, reasonable prices, chill atmosphere. Great place to take parents!"}
{"text":"An awesome ahem... old fashioned... bar overlooking the state capital. A Wisconsin student told me this is THE place to go if you're in town for a day, so go I went!   Any place that offers snack beef jerky at the bar for $1.50 is awesome in my books. The huge tap beer selection, incredible cheese curds, and top notch walleye sandwich didn't hurt either.   I enjoyed my visit so much that I brought back a group of 8 people a couple days later. Everyone had great comments about their meal, and those who ordered mac and cheese seemed especially impressed. It was packed on a Thursday night, which just goes to show I'm not the only person person who thinks this may be the coolest place ever."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection and at an excellent price. Great location, though it can be quite a long wait. Cheese curds are a necessity, of course. The place simply has as Wisconsin of a feel as you'll get in the state!  *Had to upgrade this to 5 stars.  Idk why I haven't eaten here more often. Definitely the best in Madison and at an affordable price. The Old Fashioned House Burger may be one of the best burgers I've ever had and my bartender may have been the best I've ever seen. The man mixed up a wicked Scotch Old Fashioned w/ an Ice Sphere and knew the menu and liquor lineup like the back of his hand."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant and I really wanted to like it.  I am still searching for a reason to give it at least four stars.  Alas, I cannot justify more than three.    It was really busy post Badger game.  They have a pretty good system where they take your number and text you when a table becomes available.  The table became available sooner than the hour and a half they first quoted us, so we were about a block and a half away and hustled over.  There was a little eye rolling from the host when we arrived, the sort of \"Where have you been we texted you 10 minutes ago\" sort of look.  They gave us a nice table by the window, though.    Our server was very good in terms of knowledge of the menu, food recommendations, and speed.  He didn't look happy to be serving on such a busy night and I felt bad that he had to keep squeezing through the masses of people near the entrance to get to his tables.  He did a commendable job given how busy it was.    The food was okay.  Just okay.  The best thing was the salad -- greens were very fresh and the vinaigrette was lovely.  The beer battered fried cheese curds were pretty good.  The grilled summer sausage sandwich was also pretty good.  Everything else we had was so-so.  The chili was fairly mediocre, not very spicy or tasty.  Prime rib sandwich was average.  Eggplant/portabella sandwich similar.  We didn't bother with dessert.  The Northern Exposure Old Fashioned was pretty decent.    Still looking for a reason to give this place more stars ... but no dice."}
{"text":"After many times of missing this place finally had to give it a try. Started out with the $3 pint of the month which was local IPA. Then had the number 30 burger with cheese curds and tiger blue on the side. The burger was flat out solid as were the curds. Sat up by the bar right away so had no issues getting a spot. Would differently recommend and go back without hesitation."}
{"text":"Great mimosas and the Breakfast sandwich was fantastic!   Reasonable pricing and a friendly waitstaff.  Would definitely recommend to a friend traveling to Madison's Capitol Square."}
{"text":"When it comes to the food, the Old Fashioned is overrated. And disappointing, because their foods are relatively simple and therefore should be done consistently well. It's the usual story in disappointing Madison restaurants: no subtlety and a lack of attention to detail.  After several experiences with sandwiches that were only okay, in later visits I moved on to the specials. Twice I had the Saturday night prime rib and twice I was disappointed. Because they don't know (or care about) the difference between rare and medium-rare. Also, forget about the French Onion soup. What should be an old-school crock with a layer of parmesan and gruyere bubbling over a salty onion beef broth is instead a weak pretender, with hardly a layer of cheese worth mentioning. Come on now.  I will say that the accompanying wedge salad is more than decent and that the onion string fries are a terrific. But they are not the main event and can't carry the show by themselves.   I say all this actually *liking* the Old Fashioned, its concept and experience. It could be great, but it's just not."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Madison and my boyfriend and I were told that we have to come to The Old Fashioned for great beer and cheese curds. I can honestly say I loved this place!   Their beer selection is phenomenal. They have over 50 Wisconsin beers on tap. I ordered the Hopalicious and really enjoyed this beer. My boyfriend had the Sproose Juice IPA and really loved it.  As for the cheese curds....amazing!! We had them with 3 sauces: tiger (horseradish), ranch and smoked paprika. The smoked paprika was my favorite. The cheese curds were the perfect crispiness and had great flavor. They give you an ample amount, as well.  The service at The Old Fashioned was truly great! We sat at the bar and both bartenders were extremely friendly and even gave us some suggestions of other places to visit around the city.  I will definitely recommend The Old Fashioned to others and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of five people in early February. We were seated at a table directly across from the entrance, and I had a bench that faced the door. My position allowed me to see the immense amount of foot traffic in and out, which explained why we were so cold. Even though there is an airlock, people don't get that you let one door close before opening the next, letting gusts of frigid February air into the restaurant. I'm sure that in the back or in the adjacent room no one even noticed, but where we sat, it was an unpleasant experience. If you are given the choice, at least in the winter, I would wait for a table further back in the room or move along. It just wasn't much fun being in the path of the winter weather while indoors.  Despite the indoor weather, the food was delicious. I had the spicy burger (jalapenos make it spicy) and fries. I also had the virgin mary (a Bloody Mary w/out alcohol) which was nice and spicy and came with a few pickled veggies.  One final note - I like a crowded restaurant and the vibe that goes with it. But interior design and materials used make this a very loud place (there is a difference between crowded and noisy) which I find makes conversation difficult. I don't think this would be good for a large group at a table, it's hard to hear from one end to the other."}
{"text":"We ate (and drank!) here after a lovely walk from Camp Randall on an unbelievably beautiful fall day after a Badger victory. There was quite a long wait, which can be expected most everywhere on gameday, but we did what anyone would do while there is an hour wait: go to the bar.  We started off drinking the namesake drink: Brandy Old Fashions. They were, of course, delicious, but the real treat was watching them be crafted in front of you. There was a certain amount of nostalgia one can feel here. It is very homey, and is an easy space to be comfortable in. I think that the allure for me is that it is a cross between Cracker Barrell, and Holeman & Finch (a spot that similarly crafts drinks and places value in quality over quantity) in Atlanta: Large portions of feel-good food you could expect at a family gathering, but the quality you'd expect of a high end restaurant.   We started our meal off with a solid Wisconsin staple, fried cheese curds. This was my first experience with the morsels of 'Sconnie pride, and I was impressed with them. They'd pair very well with a New Glarus Spotted Cow, or any dark beer.  I had the Prime Rib sandwich, and it was fantastic. The horseradish sauce was perfectly complimentary, and went very well with potato salad. I also sampled the Mac-n-cheese off of my girlfriend's plate, and it was wonderfully cheesy and wholesome.   Perhaps my favorite feature in The Old Fashioned is that which is housed behind the bar- a big jug of pickled eggs. I'm a pickled egg fanatic, so to see what most consider a stomach-flipping, only-as-a-dare delicacy sitting behind the bar, I couldn't help but oblige we have a couple. They were simply delicious, and if you're typically too scared  to try one, do yourself a favor and try them here."}
{"text":"Don't get the beer cheese soup! All else is OK, regular bar food in very crowded but also very lively atmosphere in a nice location on the square."}
{"text":"Friday night work lunch, so I only tried the food, not the drinks. The food was delicious and the prices were very approachable for the atmosphere and location. The beer-battered cheese curds are very light (weight and mouthfeel) and are delivered hot and melty. Maybe too hot and melty - I like my curds to have a little more heft and squeak to them, which they only have when colder. To go full Wisconsin I paired that with a brat sandwich, which was very tasty and the right size for my lunch appetite. Everyone else around the table got the burgers, which looked tremendous, or huge sandwiches with mountains of fries. For drinks, I didn't sample, but there's a great selection of 30 beers on tap with about half from local breweries. I love Madison, and it's because every place I go ends up being 5 stars. Madison just breaks my rating system when it comes to Midwestern comfort food. I'll need to return sooner than every 4 years."}
{"text":"We visited family in Madison and headed in to the Old Fashioned for lunch. The place was hopping!! We enjoyed those crisp and flavorful onion strings, cheese curds and the clam chowder. I had the bratwurst sandwich and my husband liked his spicy burger and my daughter devoured a tuna salad sandwich. My grandson had fish sticks from the kids' menu. The service from Jessica was great!! I hear it's difficult to get in for dinner but we were grateful to get the Madison experience at lunch!!"}
{"text":"A must stop when in Madison.   Great beer list. Maybe the best fried egg burger I've had. Terrific cheese curds with a great paprika dipping sauce. Sweet environment and super festive before games.   What else do you need?"}
{"text":"What an interesting experience at The Old Fashioned! This was one of my must do places and although we had fun, there were some strange service things going on here. The wait for a table when we arrived was 1 hour and it was accurately about an hour until we got our table. We sat at the bar while we waited and ordered different drinks. I went for beers while the guys went for Old Fashioneds. My guy friends are whiskey drinkers so they were surprised when the drink had no whiskey at all but instead Korbel champagne. One male friend loved this...one did not. He asked our bartender who scoffed and said, \"You're not from around here, are you?\" ....um....okay....  I *now* get the Old Fashioned is different in Madison than the rest of the country but my friends and I had no idea of this going in. It wasn't great having our bartender handle the situation in a judgmental type of way. Would have boded much better had he taken another approach and helped enlighten our ignorant Chicagoan minds.   Cheese curds here were just okay - not as good as some of the other places in the area.  I had to order a cool $15 drink that was on the menu - The Birdcage - Whistle Pig Bourbon, muddled brown sugar cube & house bitters enclosed in an ice block. Crack it open and proceed to get white girl wasted. This was a fun drink and tasty, was very happy with this one.  We also had this awesome brownie dessert which was so rich, served with a strawberry, ice cream and a shot of milk! The milk was such a cute touch and I loved this dish to end our night.  The view from the Old Fashioned? Gorgeous looking out on a lit up capital building.  Overall, the food was hit or miss, the drinks were hit or miss, service was hit or miss, but that view was all hit!"}
{"text":"Both times I've eaten here it was OK, but the food was really greasy. If you like that type of food, then it's a great restaurant. It has two bars (with fantastic Old Fashioneds, of course), a wonderful atmosphere, friendly hostesses and wait staff, and pretty good prices. It is in a great location on the capital square as well. The downsides were the long wait, greasy food, and loud dining area."}
{"text":"I hate that I had to give this four stars and it's even worse that this is higher than I should be giving it.    We walked in and were seated by a nice hostess.  She brought us water immediately.  Less than 5 minutes later while one of us was in the restroom our waitress came over and said is there anything I can get you to drink and I said the water is fine.  She took the drink menu and opened it on my husbands plate across from me and goes well there's this and walked away.  He came back and I was going to go to the restroom and she comes back over after he said do you know what you want? (So he could order for us) and she comes back over and goes \"well do you even know what you want?\" My husband was like she's going to the restroom, thank you.  She walked away and never came back and another waitress assisted us.  This waitress was fine, nothing great or nothing bad.  But I don't understand the deal with the first waitress and no introduction of reason for the second waitress.  Everyone we interacted with seemed to not be very happy.  There was a couple that came in after us who they put at a table in the middle of everyone and they asked if they could sit at one of the booths.  The waitress was like that's for 4 people.  Mind you there were 8 tables that we could see that were for 4 people readily available for a party of 4 to sit at.  It was not busy at all.     Now onto the reason we gave them any stars.  I had the grilled cheese sandwich and ordered my side as macaroni and cheese.  Both were simply amazing.  As s cheese lover they did an a great job.   The Mac and cheese has breadcrumbs on top of it which just tops off any plate of Mac and cheese.  The grilled cheese was cheesy, melted, and the red peppers gave it a great flavor.  I almost ordered it without bacon because normally restaurant bacon is just terrible, but there's was perfect.    My husband had the fire grilled burger with jalapeños. It was delicious and again the bacon was a key ingredient to making it great.  He also ordered a cappuccino. We were a bit disappointed that it didn't come with a biscotti since it was not a cheap establishment but he said it was delicious.    The service was poor, but the food was splendid!"}
{"text":"It really pains me to downgrade them to three stars, but this morning's experience was so awful that I think it's mandatory.  We went there for breakfast around 9:30 and sat at the bar. P. Jones, whoever that is, was the incompetent bartender taking orders. It took him 15 minutes to take our order. Yeah...15 minutes. Then, we didn't get our actual food until 10:15--after waiting over half an hour!   Normally, 30 minutes' wait for food would be tolerable, but it was cold...which means it was sitting out. Sigh. So, either the fault goes to the expediters or our bartender, but it's totally unacceptable service. My favorite bar in Madison delivering a sub-par experience? That's just wrong.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Great Wisconsin joint, decent prices, top local beer selection, but not worth the ridiculously long wait.  The Old Fashioned does what one might call \"nouveaux\" Wisconsin food. They stick to supper club classics with neat-but-not-too-adventurous twists. Classic burger with all local ingredients but on a brioche-like bun with paprika mayo? Excellent. Whole walleye fillet fish-fried on sourdough toast? One of the best fish sandwiches anywhere.   Their best items are the walleye, beer cheese soup, hot dog/brat selections, and good-quality burgers. For my money their cheese curds are second in Madison only to Graze. Lazy Susans are amazing collections of Wisconsin fare. Super creamy mac and cheese with traditional baloney (more sausage-like than cold cut) is a must-eat in Madison--one of the city's destination dining dishes. Fish fry is just OK.   Some items are more miss than hit. Their tuna sandwich is poor, their vegetarian sandwich is an unpleasant mix of flavors, the grilled cheese isn't enough food, and their pulled pork is substandard. Also, their bacon is sometimes served \"rare\" or uncooked, whatever you'd call it. Make _sure_ to ask for crispy bacon.   Beer selection is one of the best in the country. Every great Wisconsin beer is accounted for. They also have fairly priced and delicious old fashioned cocktails that are definitely worth trying.  This place is insanely busy all day long. Prices are low. Service is hence understandably harried and disinterested. Best advice is to come during early bird hours or after the dinner rush. If you get here between 6 and 8pm expect to wait for an hour for a seat."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, cheap, mediocre food. The servings are large, but only of average quality of a restaurant of this reputation/decor level. You won't be disappointed or hungry when you leave, but you won't be blown away either. Beer is the strong suit here."}
{"text":"Update, 4/14/18: went for fish fry last night. Round one: Husband's perch, my cod were cold. Sent back. Round two: my cod was hot, husband's perch cold. He sent his back again. Round three: Manager brought out hot perch and it was terrific. Love the fish fry here. Not sure why it was cold at first, but the manager made it right and comped husband's meal. We'll be back. Again and again. Great service, food. Worth the wait. Mistakes happen, but management cares and makes it RIGHT.  The Old Fashioned is my favorite place to take out-of-town guests. It showcases the Wisconsin food and culture that we all remember from trips Up Nort', but offers some sensible and vegetarian food, too.  The walleye is terrific (huge portion) and the stuffed trout is great (if you don't mind your fish staring at you). They also have salads with Wisconsin ingredients like bleu cheese and Door County Cherries.  It's always fun when my guests see that they can add a fried egg, bacon, or Braunschweiger to their orders for little extra."}
{"text":"Went here for Friday fish fry. It was just ok. This is a great place and I know it's popular but I can't recommend the fish fry."}
{"text":"Best restaurant is Madison Wisconsin by far. Obviously they have great old fashion but allusion amazing selection of beers.  My favorite thing to eat: the spicy burger with pepper jack and Jalapeño with a side of cheese curds. Also make sure to give their Arnold Palmer a try if you like them they truly make one of the best possible."}
{"text":"If you're in Madison near the State Capitol, then you need to stop in & get your cheese curds here!  Not just cheese curds, the burgers are pic too!  The cheese curds have a really light and fluffy batter that so good with several choices for dipping sauces.  I also ordered the #30 burger (there are many burgers to choose from) - this was recommended by my amazing server - Davina (props) & she was right, it was so good!  While eating I did notice that this place gets very busy, the line was literally out the door!   The drinks were good, food was amazing, you should stop in hungry and get your fix here!  Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"It was Saturday morning.  Yeah i get it.  The place was busy.  We were seated at a back table.  It was good because it took us away from most of the noise.  It was not so good because it was dark.  Really dark.  Like get out the phone flashlight to read the menu.  The server, Hayden, did a decent job.  The chocolate milk my wifemate ordered didn't come until after she had finished eating.  So, he took it back and took it off the bill.  I had the bagel and lox.  It was satisfactory.  Not stellar, but no complaint about it.  My wif had scramble eggs with veggie pesto.  The pesto made the eggs kinda squishy.  The highlight was the rosemary potatoes.  Cooked just right, seasoned appropriately.  Very good.  Worth another vist?  Maybe."}
{"text":"Best service we've ever experienced in the whole city. The Wisconsin platter is out of this world. Bartenders are so kind and the food has always been perfect! I'll keep coming back every time I visit Madison."}
{"text":"After the miss at Echo Tap in the search for good WI cheese curds, we ended up here. These were awesome!! Didn't eat anything else so can't comment on that; however, the drinks were good and they had a good selection of beers."}
{"text":"The food here was awesome. My brother in law and his fiancé took me here on Sunday for lunch. The food was good and definitely there cheese curds. Will be back"}
{"text":"I always believe in second chances so I thought it only fair to revisit my review of The Old Fashioned. Here is my original review;  My Fiance and I tried The Old Fashioned about two months ago. We ordered the Wisconsin's Best Wurst platter, but I can't tell you how it was because we never got it, I'm pretty positive our server forgot because it didn't show up on our bill. For dinner,  I had the Prime Rib Saturday night special, which was pretty bland, and my fiance had a sandwich which he said wasn't anything out of the ordinary. The drinks were strong which is the only reason The Old Fashioned got two stars instead of one in my book, probably won't be going back for food, but maybe drinks.  Updated Review:  We've been back a few times since our original visit and I have to say it has gotten better. I'm chalking up my first review to meh, lets say off service. I used to be a server so I can understand an off day. Anyways, since then I have had a few drinks at The Old Fashioned. My favorites are Side cars, Old Fashioned. and Amaretto Sours. Each time I have gotten a pretty darn good drink with equally good service. I've only eaten the cheese curds and a burger (can't remember the name) but they were quite good as well. I'm becoming a life longer member or anything but I don't mind occasionally stopping in for a drink or two!"}
{"text":"I'm from LA, so the House Burger isn't exactly a menu item I would normally go crazy for considering I've seen (and tasted) ones just like it. But, I do have to say that it was fairly tasty. The pork shoulder, though, was pretty damn good. I don't normally order pork sandwiches EVER...but I thought I'd try this one because of a picture a Yelper posted up and I even gave it a chance regardless of the texas toast (I hate that stuff!)...and it didn't disappoint! The bread got soggy pretty quickly but the flavors were very satisfying. Oh, and dipping it in their house ranch made it even better.  I had cheese curds for the first time and I found that the larger sized ones were less salty than the smaller cuts. Still yummy though. Especially dipped in ranch! (I love ranch).  Will DEFINITELY come back here again!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here and we've been here lots of times. This is THE place to bring visitors for a true Wisconsin experience.  Best cheese curds in town. They also have a burger that has an egg on top that my wife loves. I usually try something new duo I've been all over the menu and hasn't been disappointed.  Great drinks. They don't take reservations so larger groups can take a while to seat on the weekends, but couples won't have a problem getting in whenever.  They do have a room upstairs that can be rented out for larger parties, wedding dinners, business dinners, etc."}
{"text":"This is my second visit at The Old Fashioned. Here on game day. Big mistake. They were crazy busy with a 40 minute wait. We were promptly seated after 40 minutes but had to wipe down our own table. The server was pleasant and attentive, no complaints. We ordered the cheese curds and 3 burgers. The cheese curds were very good. Lightly battered, hot, melty and yummy! I had the Tavern burger with the bacon and egg. It was OK. I had to season it quite a bit. My teenage sons liked their burgers, but nothing spectacular. Unfortunately, their fries were WAY under cooked. I know the kitchen was crazy busy, which is why I did not send them back. All in all, it took an hour and a half for a 30 minute meal. The food is Ok to good but never again on game day. Just too unpleasantly packed & crazy."}
{"text":"I came here on a visit to Madison from California for a research conference. First thing: REAL cheap compared to CA (2.50-4 buck beers!), 52 type of beers and an even more extensive total list with all accounted for. Food was super greasy and super german which was just the ticket. Cheese, Beer, Brauts. Yum. The service is awesome too! My one major gripe was that there is NO AC!"}
{"text":"A classic for anyone new to Madison. Prepare for giant portions of comfort food and a wide variety of beer. Not a place to go for fine dining, but it has a fun, kitschy atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a pleasant introduction to Madison, WI.  Cut your way through the political tension and grab a seat at the bar to avoid the wait.  Take your time ordering through over a hundred beers.  Sample all the old fashioneds.  Just remember that, no matter what, you are not Don Draper.  As nice as folks from Wisconsin are, they will still snicker if you come in stunting a fedora with a Lucky Strike dangling from your lips."}
{"text":"I went to the Old Fashioned around brunch time on a Sunday and it was a bit crowded. We were sort of in a hurry so the wait for our lunches seemed long, but were we not in a hurry it would have been alright. I liked the menu, there were a lot of interesting Wisconsin specialties including cheese plates, which I thought was a cool mix of slightly upscale and Wisconsin. Nice atmosphere, great prices and good food. I didn't love my grilled vegetable sandwich, but I didn't read the menu close enough to realize it had an olive spread on it, and I'm not a huge olive fan. It was well-grilled and the fries were terrific, so no complaints overall."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here after a long and annoying flight, and we were tired, hungry and annoyed. First, we were impressed by the beer selection, they had lots! I wanted a wheat beer so I asked the waiter what kind I should get (were from the east coast so some of the beers didn't look familiar). He recommended something that was hoppy and disgusting, so clearly the waiters need to step up their game in knowing their beers. I had to trade beers with my partner.   Then is when the magic happened, the cheese curds came out. I know we're not used to them but holy mackerel they were delicious, cheesy and hot. They were paired with a horseradish blue cheese, which was beyond delicious and light. I got the old fashioned burger with the egg- lots of great flavors. The bun was buttery and nicely toasted. I didn't love the pound of onions on top and the many spoonfuls of garlic sauce on it. Next time, I would order it without those two. The egg was delicious thiugh. Hubby ordered the hot dog with sauerkraut,  land he seemed to like it. I wasn't a fan at all. It tasted more like a maple sausage and it was bright red meat. Who knows, I'm just a tourist but I ain't never seen a beef hot dog like that befoe'!   The service was very quick and the people were friendly. Cute little spot to grab a bite, especially if you like beer!"}
{"text":"Pros :   *Cheese curds  *Bar (extensive tap selection, great old fashioneds, cherry bounce) *Walleye sandwich *Atmosphere  Cons: *ALWAYS over an hour wait no matter the time of day *Really bland tacos *Everything else on the menu is either mediocre at best or covered in horseradish *No reservations (ever.  While they did remedy it with some free drink tokens our friends wanted to have their rehearsal dinner here and they would NOT take a reservation for this.  The couple even offered to pay to rent the upstairs, etc) *We had a going away dinner / drinks here awhile ago and the staff could not have made it any more clear how annoyed they were that we had to add a few chairs through the course of our stay"}
{"text":"I'm really conflicted with reviewing The Old Fashioned because I had day and night experiences. I went a year ago for a nice casual dinner with my sister and really enjoyed it! I've always heard such great things about this place from locals. Well, I came back to visit Madison again recently, and I took my parents here which turned out to be an awful dinner.  Although my food turned out to be good and I enjoyed it, my mom had a real issue with their steak. I get that this place is more a casual dining experience with an emphasis on sandwiches and apps but if you have a ribeye steak on your menu for almost $30, I'd expect your chef to be able to cook it properly. My mom ordered it to be medium rare (which I think is pretty standard for steaks) and when they brought it out it was more well-done. We informed our server who took it back and later, brought out a new steak which also turned out to be overcooked. At this point, this is just a bit ridiculous for a $30 steak.... finally the manager (Mitch, I believe his name is) came by and basically said oh well, we'll comp it but that's all I can do and walked away. No apology. No polite customer service. Just basically rude and giving us the message that we were inconveniencing him; hence the two stars--I cannot stand such rude service. And its such a shame because I love their cheese curds. But I honestly just cannot see myself coming back here for dinner, maybe for a drink but whenever we come to visit my sister from now on, we'll steer clear of this place for sure."}
{"text":"I would give it a 5 but its ALWAYS so crowded  ..  If you are on a diet, please don't open the door .. this is def a food coma place ...Their scotch ale is amazing, their cheese curds are aite, but hell you can substitute your french fries for cheese curds .. only in wisconsin .. their cheese platters are great and their meals leave you full, I always get the veggie sandwich"}
{"text":"Inspired by the traditions of Wisconsin taverns and supper clubs, The Old Fashioned was created to pay tribute to the foods and spirits that make Wisconsin famous.  They are open weekdays for breakfast, weekend brunch, lunch, dinner and late night.  They serve traditional local fare and during the summer they are literally at the doorstep of the huge farmers market that Madison has become famous for.   It is a great complement as Old Fashioned strives to use all locally purchased ingredients from the farms to our tables.    Everything here is fresh and tasty.    This is the perfect place to take guests from out of town and show them what Wisconsin food is all about.  It is also an excellent place to go yourself, if you want to know about the traditional food favorites of the state you live in."}
{"text":"SOLID 4 STARS.   I attempted to come here last fall and much to my surprise it was closed for a business party, I was pretty bummed, Today i was passing through Madison and needed to have some lunch, so i took the drive off the freeway right up the the capitol square. drove around attmepted to find parking and didn't have much luck, Till i spotted a parking garage about a block away off Webster and Miffin.   Everyone RAVES about the cheese curds, so that was a no brainer i'll have to try it. I also got the house old fashioned burger topped Bavaria's hickory-smoked bacon, aged Cheddar, garlic sauce and a soft-cooked egg on a buttered and toasted roll (It also comes with fried onions but i asked for those to be left off)  My fiance ordered the Chilli Cheese dog.  Quickly after ordering our cheese curds came out, And let me tell you They are AWESOME. From someone who has gone to many \"famous cheese curd spots\" and  had a large variety of deep fried cheese, These are easily in the top 3 or 4 of best i've ever had. Well worth an order or two or maybe three? Butter Milk ranch dipping sauce was a great addition.   The main course came soon after the egg on the burger was just as described with the \"soft cooked\" as soon as i grabbed the burger the egg yolk burst all over, AWESOME. I typically HATE egg yolks unless the yolk is running over something like an great cheeseburger, and that's just what this place has. the meat was good, the bacon was really good. the garlic sauce was different but a good addition to the burger. My 1 complaint on the burger is they must use a sharp or extra sharp chedder for the burger as it was quite strong, atleast for my liking, then again i'm not a fan of sharp chedder. The French fries are also very good, My Fiance also enjoyed the Chili cheese dog, The  pricing was fair for what we got,   If you're in the Madison area you should REALLY make it a point to come to the Old Fashioned!"}
{"text":"Good pub/bar food but in Madison WI this is really the olympics of bar food and it has a lot of tough competition. Their claim to fame is their obnoxiously large menu and the ridiculous amount of brandy old-fashioneds served.... Their cheese curds are well known around town but I think Dotties does everything a little better..... especially the curds....."}
{"text":"Gotta love the cheese curds! The Walleye fish sandwich was delicious and after cheese curds, I had the salad instead of fries.  Huge portions of both.  In a word, delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here after a Badger game for the ultimate Wisconsin experience. I'm from Texas, so I always love dining at highly rated restaurants in Wisconsin, especially in Madison. The service at The Old Fashioned was great as well as the food. The cheese curds were very yummy and my grilled cheese was amazing. It's also located right outside the capitol which is pretty cool. Definitely recommend if you're a native Wisconsinite or a lucky visitor to this wonderful state!"}
{"text":"the burgers are absolutely wonderful... filled with flavor, cooked just right...  the fried cheese curd is another incredible thing worth ordering -   the atmosphere was great, service was impeccable... absolutely recommend to both visitors and locals --"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was truly abysmal. We came in at the tail end of the lunch rush on a Friday afternoon. The cheese curds are good, as was the beer cheese soup.  We also tried the Walleye sandwich, the Chicken  Bacon sandwich, the Bacon Mac & Cheese, and one of the salads. All solid choices. Because the service was so bad, lunch took almost 2 hours...she never checked in and we had to flag her down several times for routine requests (like spoons for the ice cream sundae and drink refills)."}
{"text":"Based on word of mouth and some reviews, I had sky-high expectations for this establishment.  It was OK.  The setting is nice, right next to the capitol building.  But form a food and service perspective it was average to above average.  The draft and bottle beer selection is legit, but mostly focused on regional selections which was disappointing.  The server was helpful and the food came out fast and was tasty - especially the cheese curds and the sandwich platters.  But it just seemed like.....a classy deli.    From an ambiance perspective I didnt get the sense we could settle in and enjoy several drinks without taking a table away from the next touristy group.  Perhaps it may be different in another section of the establishment, as we sat near the entrance and hostess booth.  I'll go back, but my hopes of this being the go-to eatery with amazing drinks is dwindling..."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and craft cocktails. Had the Old Fashioned burger which included finely aged Wisconsin cheddar, perfectly crisped bacon, and a soft-cooked egg. Had mine with a gluten free bun and it was perfect. Had the house potato salad on the side which was okay - fairly dry with mushy potatoes. Brandy old-fashioned sour was perfectly made but served with a cherry and orange instead of green olives.  They do not take reservations, even for a large group. We had a group of 14 on a Sunday afternoon at 3pm and still had to wait about 45 minutes for a table. However, service was quick albeit the server was a bit unfriendly and a made a couple rude side comments about having to serve a group. Aside from that, everyone's food came out perfect, hot, and all at the same time."}
{"text":"I visited on Friday 4/27/18 before 5pm for an early dinner.   Service was meh- he didn't seem to care if we were there or not and they weren't busy. Usually servers come over after the food has been delivered to see if you need anything and to see how things taste- nope! I had to ask a lady that was clearing dishes for more napkins.   I liked my glas of Malbec and the price $6.50 was great along w/ the pour size. My friend had a pint of Oatmeal stout $5.00- she liked it.  Our food was good although I found my sandwich bread to be overly buttered which isn't my preference BUT the bacon on the #37 $8.95 was the highlight along w/ the mustard sauce, no mayo. My friend liked her #33 Turkey $8.95  Overall, I would return and hope for a more attentive server and would try something else BUT order the same Malbec. Prices are reasonable and it's within walking distance of the Capital."}
{"text":"Very cool local spot popular with the local young professionals and college students. Outstanding rustic atmosphere in a renovated turn of the last century building. This might be on many people's \"must experience\" places.  Great selection of spirits and beers.  Be careful of the single occupant restrooms which caught me off guard. I met a few local colleagues there and we had no trouble carrying on a casual and engaging conversation.  I plan on coming back again during my next visit. Something I don't do all that often, typically preferring to always strike out to someplace new."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to going to The Old Fashion.  We had plenty of time to wait for a table.  Found a place at the back bar.  I ordered a perfect Korbel Manhattan and my friend an old fashion.  When my drink came, I asked if he had put any dry vermouth in the drink.  It was VERY heavy on the sweet vermouth.  He said he had.  I asked for a bit more.  It didn't help.  We decided to eat at the bar and were asked if we wanted another drink.  After some conversation about the quality of the first drink, I gave additional instructions to the second bartender  - light on both vermouths.  The second drink came just like the first.  I mentioned that to the bartender and he said \"know where you can get a good drink\".  I said yea at home and he said exactly.    What ever happened to the customer is always right?  The food was good.  The drink and bartender not so much.  Not sure I will return."}
{"text":"I usually don't like to be a downer for businesses... however... my truest experience at Old Fashion was... \"meh\". I think their drinks are great! It's a great place to socialize and have brunch or dinner with friends or go on a date. It's just not my kind of vibe. I went there with my two friends and the wait for a table was going to be about an hour and a half. My friends and I were okay with that because we wanted to just hang out and have dinner. We made our way to the bar to wait for a table and the bar was so packed, we almost didn't have a spot. As soon as people got up and left their seats at the bar, we snagged it but it was only two seats. Then we waited and finally got another seat at the bar and decided to just order food at the bar. I felt rushed towards the end of my meal though, because there were people behind us waiting for us to leave the bar. That day, I'm not sure if it was because they were super busy or if their food is just always mediocre. I ordered a burger and was not impressed. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had but it also was not the best. My friends and I also got cheese curds. The cheese curds were good but they were the most oily cheese curds I've ever had. My friend got the fried fish platter and it was decent. Overall, I would rather opt for a less crowded place to hang out and have dinner with friends. I felt like the prices for the food was not worth it. Other then that, I gave a three star because the service isn't bad for it being so busy."}
{"text":"Classic Wisconsin awesomeness.  Total comfort food and you can't beat the prices.  Get there early, no reservations and wait time can be long.  We arrived before 5 on Saturday and waited 10-15 minutes for a table.  Completely worth the wait.  Beer cheese soap is the best."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorites.   The bacon macaroni and cheese is so incredible that I don't even care if the portion size is too big because this is one thing that is still delicious the next day. I love a wedge salad beforehand.   Think it's great that they have so much local stuff.   I took a large group of Brazilians in last week and they were very impressed!! Although slightly confused when they asked \"what kind of food is it\" and I was like \"I don't know...American?\" They had never had macaroni and cheese!!! Lucky for them this was their first experience with what macaroni and cheese should be, and not Kraft dinner!  I've had breakfast there I want to say biscuits and gravy? But honestly can't remember. I can remember it is fabulous!  I would always eat there when staying in Madison."}
{"text":"OMGsh cheese curds are pieces of heaven! The beer-cheese soup is way too good And I have the Wednesday special trout fish - awesome Of course had to have an Old Fashioned! Everything was great. Service, price and quality of food. What else can you ask for? Definitely coming back next time I come to Wisconsin!!!"}
{"text":"Get the cheese curds! Great selection of beers on tap. Gets very busy on the weekend but a must do if in the Madison area. Right on Capitol Square it's all the good eats of Wisconsin in one meal."}
{"text":"All the other reviews are correct. This place has great food. The spicy burger is VERY well named. The cheese curds are fantastic. Don't forget to grab a giant cookie from the bar for $1. Glad we stopped there."}
{"text":"Great place to get a burger and cold beer..   Calm, laid back environment, Staff is very attentive and quick. My gf and I both ordered burgers and oh man!!  they did not disappoint us! The burgers were big and juicy and flavorful! gianormous beer selection on tap and bottled. (Thats pretty much a piece of heaven if you're a beer snob like me :D )  If you're in down town madison looking for a great meal and a cold beer I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds in town and a great lunch and dinner stop. The only downside is at lunch you order at the counter and go sit down. If you have never been there before its a bit confusing and overwhelming. but after the first visit its a breeze."}
{"text":"The typical Wisconsin fare is available. The cheese curds were great.  The Mac and Cheese was amazing as well."}
{"text":"This place is located in a sweet area, right across from the capital and surrounded by bars and restaurants. Tap list here is very impressive with 51 beers on draft alone. Cheese curds are excellent and the sandwich I got was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"You must get a Old Fashion, Lazy Susan, Cheese Curds and No. 30 at some point. We were left alone for long periods of time and they did mess up one thing on our order but the manager came out and fixed it (just gave us the wrong burger). Place is loud. Put the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Great place in Madison for dinner with guests. Cheese curds are really good. Good bar food."}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch spot with a fantastic view of the capital dome. Between us, we ordered the Wisconsin burger, the Spicy Burger, the Grilled Vegetable Sandwich, and the Kid's Hotdog. Of course we started with the Fried Cheese Curds and a flight of beer. Everything was great and I'd happily come again."}
{"text":"This review is for their cheese curds only. Cool old school institution that seems to have been around for a long time. There was a wait at 2pm on a Saturday, but we were able to grab one of the last bar seats. They had a good selection of beers on tap, but not a lot of dark beers, so we ended up just trying their famous Housemade Fresh Wisconsin Beer Battered Cheese Curds ($6.95 + Tiger Sauce [Horseradish Cream Cheese $0.50], http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WbR2m8guE55e-c5Cm5vl3g&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg), which were delicious! They came out piping hot in less than 10 minutes, and the tiger sauce was the perfect accompaniment, although I wish the horseradish flavor was a bit stronger. The batter on the cheese curds was light but very crispy, and it was the perfect level of saltiness- a must order! I would definitely come back for more cheese curds. Their portions also looked very generous from what I could see, so definitely good value for the price. Parking in downtown shouldn't be too difficult, unless it's during Saturday morning when they have the huge farmer's market."}
{"text":"This place didn't disappoint. Had the old fashion without the egg and was happy with the outcome. Juicy and well cooked burger.   I'm from Florida and came here because of the yelpers. Thank you for the recommendation."}
{"text":"I guess this is like an old Wisconsin supper club? I wouldn't know, but do I know the food is great! Have only been for lunch, but yummy veggie sandwich and unique options for sides."}
{"text":"My god, this is my kind of place. First stop in Madison this summer. I had a burger and some cheese curds. I'd never eaten a curd before but I cannot imagine them being any better to the heaven on a plate I was served at the OF. The meal was astounding.   They had a specially priced New Glarus draft all night that was super cheap and a perfect complement to the meal. Our service was excellent."}
{"text":"I went to the Taste of Madison this weekend, and the cheese curds from the Old Fashioned are probably the best i've ever had.  I can't believe I've never eaten here before!  They were super greasy (as a good curd should be).  Culvers has about the worst cheese curds in the world (more like mozzerella sticks made with cheddar) and these are head and shoulders better than that.  The batter was light, and the cheese was fresh.  Very tasty.  I had a bit of the macaroni and cheese, and I thought it was tasty, but lacked some underlying flavor which made it seem kind of one-dimensional and not really the transcendent experience that other people seem to have had.  The noodles were a little overdone, but I'm not going to say too much about it, since they were made for the Taste.    Anyway, I'm perfectly willing to give them another chance."}
{"text":"I consistently love this place.  Their menu is balanced and robust, the ingredients are fresh, and it's a great go-to.  Apparently a lot of people agree, because it's always packed.  They do a good job of getting food out fast and hot regardless of the crowd- no small feat.  The #40 is my usual choice, my husband goes for the #41 and our daughter loves the chicken fingers and fries.  The chicken fingers are actually made in the kitchen- not pulled from the freezer like so many kids nuggets are....she is 3 years old and requests The Old Fashioned on a regular basis.  The prices are right, the beer selection is spot on, and don't forget a giant chocolate chip cookie- they are baked fresh and worth every calorie!!"}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is awesome! It's got mouth watering burgers at a reasonable price. The cheese curds are phenomenal, the wait staff have all been friendly  and on the spot. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a place that you have to check out at least once in Madison.  Dependable, fun to experience and so many things to look at while waiting.  We had a great time our last visit, however the beer cheese soup didn't taste the same as I remembered it.  It was overpowering with a swiss taste, just not for me.  The rest of the food was good and they were great with our toddler."}
{"text":"In Madison on business & read about this place.  I arrived around 5:30 or so on a Thursday night & it was packed!  Both bars were full, but I managed to find one seat.  The service was very good and the food was ok. I heard about their curds, and I must admit, I have had better.  I am sure their food is great, otherwise, they wouldn't have such a turn out on a regular basis.    The ambiance is very nice & you can tell the locals meet here and it is a regular hangout.  I enjoyed chatting with some local students & learned some neat things about Madison.  I would return if I get the chance to visit Madison again.  Next time, I will order an Old Fashioned & some steak!"}
{"text":"Trust the cheese curd hype! The sauces are almost better than the curds themselves. And their Old Fashioneds are, appropriately, made with the craft and care that they deserve, and there are a dizzying amount of options to choose from when it comes to the components. Keep in mind that they are very busy, however, and can be very loud around dinner time and later at night."}
{"text":"I am severely disappointed in my experience at the old fashioned tonight. I organized a dinner for my boyfriends birthday and we ended up having a group of nine people. I know they don't take reservations so I arrived at the restaurant an hour before I told my guests to arrive so that I could get our name on the list and wait at the bar. However, the host did not make me aware of their ridiculous seating policy and I didn't know that all of my guests had to be present in order to even get considered for a table. The restaurant was not that busy but we ended up waiting for 2 hours. I have worked in food service for years so I understand it is a stressful and under appreciated job but the staff was so rude and unaccommodating that I will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant serving the best foods of Wisconsin. A wide varieties of cheese, beer, etc. Today I had the fried haddock sandwich and fries for lunch - very good. Lunch is handled differently than most places - you're seated with menus and then you go up a register to order and pay. Someone brings out your food shortly after.  The lunch menu is smaller than the dinner menu, alas, but lunchtime is pretty crowded. This has gotta be one of the best restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"52 Wisconsin micro brews on tap with one of the more innovative menus I have seen. If you love \"Wisconsin\" food, you will love this place."}
{"text":"It's hard to be mad at the world when you're walking through the farmers' market near the capitol on a beautiful morning in Madison - even if you've got a hangover. But a Bloody Mary from the Old Fashioned still helps. Our group of four put our name down, were quoted a 45 minute wait (hey, it was game day), and grabbed a couple of Bloody Mary's (Maries?) from the bar. The excellent cocktail came with pickled asparagus, Brussels sprout, and olive, with a shot on the side. At first we thought we were meant to drop in our own vodka, but no, it was a beer chaser. I guess that's just how they roll in Wisconsin. They weren't quite spicy enough for us Texans, but the bartender recommended we add a dash of Sriracha - which I had never done before - and it worked. Really well. That's a trick I'll remember for the future.  After waiting for awhile outside in the glorious weather, watching people peruse the market, our name was called and we sat down at a spacious table. We ordered the fried cheese curds for an appetizer, and finally \"got\" the whole Wisconsin cheese curd thing. These were perfectly golden fried, and orders of magnitude better than our previous experience. I then ordered a Wisconsin Bloody Mary, which was a virtual breakfast in a glass: pickle, cheese curds (not fried), a spicy pickled egg, and a slab of beef jerky, with the de rigueur beer chaser on the side. Excellent, and highly recommended.  For our entree, we were each drawn to the No. 1, Wisconsin Benedict, and ordered a round. I love Eggs Benedict in theory, but don't generally like Hollandaise sauce, so I prefer them at places like Mama's Cafe back in Texas, where the Mexicana version uses queso, or at the Old Fashioned here in Madison, where the Wisconsin version uses a tangy mustard blend. The eggs were actually sunny side up rather than poached, runny, and set atop an English muffin, and of course, this being Wisconsin, a Bratwurst patty. The rosemary potatoes that came on the side had a crispy fried exterior, and were a delicious accompaniment to the Benedict.  Though I love a big diner breakfast on Saturdays before a big game, I can't really call this \"diner\" food, more like \"upscale comfort food,\" but it was nevertheless a fantastic start to the day, and I would be eager to try any number of their other dishes. Guess I'll just have to make another trip back to Madison."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the cheese curds were nice, light and airy. They could do them a little better by substituting the wax parchment paper for paper towel to help soak up some of the grease from the fryer.   The burgers were good, cooked properly and tasted great.  Our server could of benefited from being a little quicker, didn't check on us that often and we sat at our table after our meal was done waiting for about 10 minutes to get our check afterwards and almost another 5-10 after I supplied a method of payment. I thought maybe he got lost on his way to the register?  But all in all, a good place to get a great bite to eat. I will definitely be back to try it again."}
{"text":"I really like going to this place with my boyfriend. I usually get a soda and a burger( the one with an egg on top), he gets a beer and the spicy burger. They have an amazing bar here fully stocked. Their cheesecurds are great as well. A good night to go is Tuesdays around 4-6PM."}
{"text":"Decent Madison staple on the square. Great bar breakfast spot. Good coffee and very reasonable prices. I go regularly for bacon, eggs, toast and coffee. Not too busy. Nice place to meet and start the day. Dinner can get busy. Nice place for soup and sandwiches."}
{"text":"We stopped by here on a road trip from Wisconsin Dells to get cheese curds, because when in Wisconsin right?  The restaurant/bar wasn't difficult to find on the streets of Madison that reminded me of a European town. Even at the weird hour of 4pm, the restaurant was pretty packed. We got seated immediately and had pretty fast service.  Our group ordered cheese curds and various burgers, as other reviews have stated. The cheese curds were reminiscent of state fair both in flavor and portions. Though slightly more expensive, they were a solid, though a little greasy choice. Enjoy with ketchup.  I ordered the signature burger, which came with a sunny side up egg. Although the burger was flavorful and tasty, the egg was overcooked, with the yolk not as runny as I like. The salad on the side was decent.  We left the restaurant slightly regretting our unhealthy decision, but not too much - the food is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Get here early! We waited 30 minutes for a seat as early as 4:30 on a Saturday. Well worth the wait as you are treated to Wisconsin fresh cheese curds and beer menu with 53 options that are changed out weekly. Food was delicious, service was average, but the atmosphere and food quality makes it a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"This place has thee best cheese curds ever! So delicious. Bartender was very friendly and attentive. I had a couple of drinks and they were delicious old fashioned's! I would highly recommend checking this place out to anyone traveling through Madison or any regulars who for some reason haven't been!"}
{"text":"As a local Wisconsinite, this is the place to go!  Right on the square.  They use local businesses/suppliers and make the usual throw back supper club fare.  Cheese curds are AWESOME.  Salad and soup is what we had after, and we shared a salad........they were that big. The Old Fashioneds are wonderful, as they should be with their namesake outside.  If you are taking in a show or comedy show on State St., it is about a 2 block walk from the ramp."}
{"text":"Come for the cheese curds, that's about it. I've gotten food here a couple of times (but really, just cheese curds) but this past weekend after the farmer's market was my first time actually eating in the restaurant.  It was one of my friend's first time in Madison and we were debating between here or Tipsy Cow, but we felt that she needed to experience curds from here first. When we went it was about 1PM on a Sunday and the line was out the door. It was a 30-40 minute wait for a group of 4 of us so we put our name down and made a final loop around the capitol and by then our table was ready so really it was more like 15-20 minutes -- not too bad.   Service was great, food was subpar. Typical American food, burgers, etc. We got cheese curds with a side of ranch to start and like usual, they did not disappoint.   I ordered a burger (the one that has the egg and bacon on it, I'm bad with remembering names) cooked medium. I'm not really a meat eater but for some reason it just sounded particularly good. It was a decent burger, but nothing to write home about. Served with the typical lettuce and pickle and fries on the side. The main reason I wanted this burger was for the sunny side up egg which was unfortunately pretty underdone. I enjoy a runny yolk, but when the whites are still runny it kind of grosses me out.   Everyone else in our group came to the same consensus that our food was just fine. Would I come back? Only for curds or for people who are visiting Madison for the first time."}
{"text":"I actually have only stopped her once for the popcorn they carry at front.  I have no yet ate here but would like to in the near future,  The main reason we have no ate here yet, is due to it always being super busy!"}
{"text":"A prime rib sandwich and an old fashioned is all I need the rest of my life. Absolutely spectacular"}
{"text":"I'm still dreaming about the fried cheese curds!"}
{"text":"The only reason this isn't five stars is that there are places I like better but everything they did was executed well. Started with a Appleton Estate Rum and Tonic. Good pour and love that they had that depth in the rums. Cheese curds with paprika sauce were good. Just not quite the transforming experience I expected. I had a great fried wahoo sandwich and my daughter had an awesome burger complete with fried egg and pronounced it delicious. Go for the warm potato chips over French fries. Different and really good. Service was good. Overall a very solid experience"}
{"text":"This location is very popular and crowded.  Expect to wait 1.5 hours during the rush hour time.  We really wanted to check this out so we waited for about an hour.  I had to order the House-made fresh Wisconsin beer battered cheese curd and they were so freaking good.  I want to say it was one of the best I've had.  My friend enjoyed her meal which was the fish fry.  This location is very loud but the food was really good."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter (16 months) and I dined here last week. Walking in the greeter was a bit icy and the waitress was too but everything went up from there.  I loved that they offered salmon and broccoli on the kids menu. Hallelujah! I don't have to feed my kid a hot dog and fries. Thank you and she loved it. Ate almost the whole thing and 1/4 of my hamburger. (Yeah, she eats the good stuff and I eat the junk food.)   My husband and I ordered a cheese plate for an appetizer. It was really tasty but a bit pricey ($12) for what we got and for the prices of everything overall.  I ordered the Wisconsin burger and tossed green salad. The salad was good and burger, perfect. My husband ordered the Old Fashioned House burger with cheese curds. The curds were as good as everyone says. Yummo!    The atmosphere was great and luckily we got there early and got in right away--it filled up pretty fast. It is a great place with some basic plates done very well."}
{"text":"Locals told those of us that were travelling that this was a great pub with great grub!  The mac and cheese was so tasty and the fried cheese curds were great.  We don't have cheese curds in Washington, so we really enjoyed them. They had about five different dip options, all of which were really good.  The lemondrop was a little odd - west coast lemondrops have lemon juice, whereas this one had more of a syrupy consistency. All in all, a great place to try."}
{"text":"Food was really good and drinks were good too..but nothing pisses me off more than un- friendly staff...we get it,you are busy but if you don't like your job go do something else...some guy out of uniform was super nice but he only brought the food to us...never saw him after that...waitress looked upset. Bartender acted like her s...didn't stink and host was a total douche to other customers...wait times are over an hour and sign posted read \"since April 6 2016,  630,000 old fashioned have been served\" so I get it your popular but maybe the locals don't care about customer service but I feel dumb contributing to their success."}
{"text":"Fun place, liked the atmosphere, good location right across from the Capitol building.  Place was hopping at 830 on a Tues but got seated right away.  Features Wisc cheese.  Had mixed greens salad with Door county cherries and a very tasty blue cheese (they said it was local).  Poblano chili soup (it was mexican night).  Cheese curds (very tasty) with a paprika sauce.  Gives off a nice local vibe-- not touristy.  Our server was excellent.  My dinner partner had the burger, which he liked."}
{"text":"Great food. They're known for their cheese curds and burgers - because they are pretty awesome, after all. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, expect to wait awhile to get a table."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy!!!!!!  So had to try this place finally since I hear about it all the time. Got the house burger which is grilled over a live fire and topped with fried onions, Bavaria's hickory-smoked bacon, aged Cheddar, garlic sauce and a soft-cooked egg on a buttered and toasted roll. It lived up to the hype, had great flavors that mixed together well!  Ah then the cheese curds, they were great till the last one. If your in Wisconsin don't be afraid to try these because no one does them like Wisconsin does them!  The service was great, had a very high energy, funny woman server wish I could remember her name but she was great. They do a great job here for burgers and curds stop in and grab a bite."}
{"text":"My dad and I came here for a day trip and were looking for dinner. Through yelp we found this place. Thankfully we found free street parking.   The place busy and there was a 20 min wait for 2 people on Thursday at 8pm. Good sign but bad for us to wait. The bar seats were first come first serve and full service. We were lucky enough to have find space at the bar to dine.   My dad had the old fashioned house burger (he substituted the burger for grilled chicken which we really appreciated). It was still well executed.  I had the spicy burger (definitely had a kick because I bit into a jalapeno). I opted for the side salad  instead of fired. it was actually impressed that the salad was a good mix of chard, arugula and baby spinach....that was a hit in my book.   The order of fried cheese curds was a lot for 2 people....this delicious greasy goodness is more suitable for a 4 people. I wished the waiter would have warned us....oh well."}
{"text":"Beer list is extensive and impressive. Not a fan of beer? Try building your own old fashioned. Not sure what they put in the batter for the fried curds but they are addictive. The food is always awesome. The Green Bay Chili is a good choice on cold winter nights. Love the supper club vibe, reminds me of the bulk of the restaurants back home between Lake Winnebago and Lake Michigan. Tip: Order all four of the dipping sauces, cheese curds, and the potato chips to share"}
{"text":"So, what's the fuss about? We went at 10.45pm on a Thursday. The music was horribly loud. Unfortunately, we were not drinking. So the loud music sounded exactly that - loud. After the waiter came to take the order, we asked for a couple of more minutes. Even though there were only a few people in the restaurant, the waiter failed to turn up even after 10 mins or so. I went to the bar counter to mention that we were waiting. The person dismissively said that he would send somebody to our table.   We ordered medium rare burger meat. Instead we got well-done ones. The taste was strictly ok. The fries were really bad. McDonald's has better fries than this place.  Will not recommend this place. Rude, inefficient personnel, bad food."}
{"text":"Good Wisconsin Pub fare. Prices are reasonable.  Daughter enjoyed prime rib.  Place can get very noisy at lunch time."}
{"text":"I love the Old Fashioned.  They've got the best deep fried cheese curds in town. The only problem is the wait. At peak times, the wait can be more than an hour. I try to go on Sundays after the lunch rush (around 2:30PM). Their beer-cheese soup is also spectacular, if a little salty."}
{"text":"What can I say? The cheese curds rock and the prices are ultra reasonable.   It's a simple as that."}
{"text":"I came to visit the Old Fashion with a group of people I met from EPIC training.  Staff and service is very good.  I ordered the Trout and OMG!!!!  it was amazingly delicious!!!  The drinks are reasonably priced as well.  I really enjoyed my dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant is another favorite of ours in the Madison, Wisconsin area.  A must try are their cheese curds.  We have been here for lunch while visiting our daughter at the University of Wisconsin.  It's in a convenient location by the capital and we plan to visit often in the future.  There's a large selection of entries and it's a lively, busy place to dine.  This restaurant gets a thumbs up review!  Enjoy -"}
{"text":"I had an Old Fashioned at the Old Fashioned, and it was all it's cracked up to be!  The bartender was really nice, explaining the history of the drink, and putting on a little show as he served it up for me.  He pulled out a map and an index for the beer drinker in the group, to explain where each of the local beers were brewed, and even allowing samples of the \"must try these while you're in Wisconsin\" beers.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about the food.  I ordered the mac and cheese with a side of steamed broccoli.... only ate the broccoli.  Disappointing, considering we're talking about the cheese state.  Same goes for the cheese curds.  I wasn't a fan.  The service, however, was spectacular.  A couple of Bostonians, Californians, and a Miamian.... yea, we were the rowdiest table at this little Midwestern gem, but no one around seemed to be bothered.  Overall, the vibe was nice.  If for nothing else, at my next visit to Wisconsin, I'll stop by for another Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"I went here with friends. I think it's overpriced (on the square, go figure) and overrated. It's just a bunch of plain old sandwiches, soups and salads as far as I could see. I wouldn't choose to go there again."}
{"text":"A long weekend to the Mad City for a family wedding brought us to the place we love to find any reason to show up.  The model for bike friendly, great food, great beer, interesting art, fine beer, thoughtful thearter, lots-o-beer, The Onion, really good beer, great education... and beer on the Terrace at the Union! Madison, WI!  The 7 hour drive full of blues and jazz and folk and indie and country took us to a hotel check-in and a dinner time conundrum. So many gnosh-eries, so little time!  With three smartphones blazing up the data highway, a consensus was quickly apparent... \"The Old Fashioned!\" But woe is us....Yelpers say wait times can be Rip Van Winkle like, historic, folkloric especially on sat nights during dinner hours... and yes, it's sat night during dinner hours  So the parking gods are smiling on us and we find a spot right on Capital square with the first pass.  Looks like the Yelpers hit the wait-list nail on the head. A crowd milling about the front door. We excuse our way inside to the host stand.  30 minutes... what?!?... who the heck are all these people... and what are they waiting for?!?  Who cares...hell we can do 30 minutes standing on our heads.  We begin.  And very way-cool is the phone app that keeps you up-to-date on where you are in line.  30 minutes turned into 20, the app gave its electronic \"you're up\" and we were in, in short time! The joint buzzes with talk and laughs and hoots and whispers.  Excuse me's and sorry's.   It's deceivingly large and comfortably full! Looks like it could have been an old hardware store from decades ago. Long and narrow. Wood everywhere.  Tables up front, looong bar to the left and booths opposite the bar.  We're led to the left just in front of the bar through a opening and down a step.  Same thing over here just kinda backwards but with one long bench down the wall opposite the bar. Leaves lots of options for table/group arrangements.  Our walk continues to the back of the room and up a long flight to even more tables on a second floor and more relaxed hustle and bustle.  We are politely deposited, menus left with decisions to be decided.  Eric or Bradley or was it Matt stopped with welcomes, nightly specials and drink orders to take. The draught taps were extensive, maybe 30 or more and mostly Wisconsin.  But we are in \"The Old Fashioned\", so the namesake it had to be.  Be notified that this establishment lets you build your own with choice of booze, mix, bitters, and garnish.  We went original recipe, $5 per if memory serves.  For us, the old fashion cocktail \"bar\" (no pun intended) is set high (see \"The Friendly Tavern\", Zionsville, IN).  \"The Old Fashioned\" old fashioned did not disappoint. Maybe a tad sweet for our taste, but the evening cocktail math progressed with 5 into 3 so the sweet was not a deal breaker.  On to the gnoshing.  As we had a late lunch in the city of the Illini U, we decided against full on dinner and went with an order of cheese curds and one of the \"Lazy Susan\" options for our triad:   Lazy Susan No. 6 (our collective thoughts parenthetically): Miesfeld market holiday garlic salami (garlicky, buttery smooth and a peppery end), Bavaria Sausage Kitchen's Braunschweiger (pure liver sausage with just the right amount of bitter finish), smoked lake trout (perfectly smoked and not over-dried), creamed herring (in a delightfully dill creamed sauce), Dusseldorf mustard (a brown mustard tang), dill pickles (house made, cold, juicy and crunchy), deviled eggs (with a dust of paprika), Widmer's Brick spread (sweet and soft with a slightly sharp finish), Vern's Sharp Cheddar spread (sharp and tangy from start to end),  plenty-o crackers & rye bread...$15.95  Lightly beer battered cheese curds... $6.95: OK, so's every Yelpers review raves about the deep fried cheese curds - hot, soft, melty and oh so tasty especially after a dip in one of The Old Fashioned signature sauces.  That's what they all say. And now for a sharp left turn.  We love cheese.  Must be four or five high end cheeses in the frig at home right now. Been in Wisconsin on many occasions but have never tried the cheese curds.  Until now. Well, we all went for it.  Tried the deep fried cheese curds and to a person we decided, don't think less of us now, cheese does not need to be battered and fried to be enjoyed.  Cheese is just fine enough as is.  We promise to say five Hail Mary's each and attend Confession on every other Sunday for a month.  As we sat and enjoyed our lazy susan offerings we commented on plates that passed us on their way to other diners. Steaks, fish, burgers and sides all looked well prepared and overflowing but for us, left for another night.  The Old Fashioned is Old School and Old Cool. It's menu is an homage to the true supper clubs of Wisconsin, the north woods and days gone by. You should not let another day go by without stopping in. The decision to curd or not to curd is yours and yours alone. Gnosh on!"}
{"text":"Best cheese curds in town! Great beers on draft."}
{"text":"Wait time is insane for such mediocre food.  The old fashioneds are not good.  Beer list is extensive, but WI only. No beer from even Chicago or Michigan, which have better beer. Sorry WI  The old fashioned does have a good burger with bacon and a fried egg. I've tried other items and been disappointed.  To be honest, the reason I gave 2/5 is because this place is always a madhouse with people waiting in the entryway and outside. I waited a couple times voluntarily when I first moved here and occasionally out of town guests want to try it (and fight the masses) so I go begrudgingly. I'd rate it 3/5 if not such a crazy and time-consuming experience.  I'd avoid it. It's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This has become a must-visit place for me when I go to Madison.  The cheese curds are top of the line  fried cheese curds. The burgers are good too. Expect crowds because it is that good."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned was great! Ordered a burger and an old fashioned, definitely will be back. Long lines but worth the wait"}
{"text":"Traveling in Wisconsin with my husband came across this place. The ambiance was welcoming and the staff was beyond friendly!! Even though my burger was super undercooked I still enjoyed all the other food! And they were super apologetic unlike a lot of places I've been too. Loved the cheese curds, Xmas decorations, and fast service!!! A must visit when in Madison!"}
{"text":"An institution in Madison.  And Wisconsin for that matter.  The service is always on point.  The food is very good.  I've had a few of the burgers, as well as salads, and they typically are flavorful and executed nicely.  There can be a wait, but enjoy a Wisconsin brew, and things will be good!"}
{"text":"For the first Cheese Curds I have ever tasted, I thought they were good, but not absolutely amazing. Eating just a few of them was more than enough. For my meal, I ordered the vegetarian sandwich, which was actually pretty tasty. I was actually surprised by the combination of the goat cheese and black olive spread, which was pretty delicious.   If you haven't tried Cheese Curds before, I would recommend still coming here since I've heard they are better than other places. I think my ideal Cheese Curd would be filled with a less strong of a cheese, like a Goat cheese, rather than American. Maybe that's just my personal preference."}
{"text":"My experience here was really good, but unfortunately my friend's was not in the same visit.  Cheese curds and onion rings were awesome for first-timers. Loved the cheese, but definitely too heavy for 1-2 people. I ordered the Wisconsin burger and although the meat wasn't seasoned as much as I prefer, I could definitely taste the difference in quality in the local grass-fed beef. Pretty good, not dynamite. My friend ordered the Prime rib Sandwich and so unfortunate that the meat was overcooked. It really was way beyond where good prime rib should be cooked. She ended up not eating it hardly at all. Big bummer.  It seems sacrilegious to visit the land of breweries and not have beer. I would have loved to partake in some local brew but a business trip did not permit. I would love to go back again some time and will return to The Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"Let's give it up for good 'ol fashioned Wisconsin food!  The pun was totally intended, by the way.  I am *in love* with the Old Fashioned Burger.  It's the most cholesteroltastic thing I've put in my body in a long, long time.  It doesn't just have meat and cheese, it also has bacon, caramelized onions, a garlic-cream sauce, AND a fried egg.  Yes, please.  If you want to be a hero, you can get it with fries... but to avoid a heart attack, you can get it with a nice mixed-green salad instead.   They also have $1-2 bottles of beer all the time.  I'm sorry, but you can't beat the awesomeness there.  I've heard the brunch is excellent, but have yet to experience it for myself.  There's usually a fairly long wait....fortunately there are the $1 beers to keep you company.  ;)"}
{"text":"When I have guests in town I love taking them to the Old Fashioned to get a taste of WI.  Most food on the menu and ALL beer on tap comes from Wisconsin.  I also love coming here to just hang out with a few friends.  There is nothing better than sitting at the bar watching MNF with a lazy susan full of local meats, cheeses, and herring to go with your Wisconsin craft brew.  They also do great burgers and some nice interpretations of old-school supper club fare."}
{"text":"Great WI fare. Friendly staff and nice location on the Square, looking at the Capitol lawn."}
{"text":"My first time at Old Fashioned was on a date.  I ordered the Old Fashioned House Burger per my date's recommendation.  It came with a choice of a side - either fries or a side salad.  I went with the fries, which were thinly cut, nicely salted and crisp.  The fries were delicious, but they were not the star of my plate.  The burger came with a beautifully fried egg precariously balanced atop a patty smeared with garlic sauce, grilled onions, cheddar cheese, and bacon.  It was a beautiful sight.  I added lettuce and tomato and then gently placed the top toasted bun, and with slow and steady pressure smushed and watched that egg yolk dribble down the side of my burger.    My first bite was amazing - the saltiness of the bacon, the creaminess of that egg yolk, and the cheese and onions, so good.  It was a messy burger, and I surely looked a mess halfway through it, yolk and garlic sauce dribbling down my chin.  Did I mention I was on a first date?  At some point, the thought that maybe I should put this burger down and try to be attractive on this date occurred to me, but it was fleeting.  This was a delicious burger and my date paled in comparison.  There was no second date, but I will forever be in his debt for introducing me to this burger.    I've since been to the Old Fashioned many times, and often times just for drinks as well.  They have a crazy selection of craft brews (50 some on tap, and another 100 bottled), and there's always a tap that's on special for really cheap.  It's a great way to sample craft brews.  And of course, they serve their namesake, the Old Fashioned.  Here, you get to fashion your own Old Fashioned, making choices for the kind of liquor, bitters, mixer and garnish.  If you prefer customizations to be done by the bartender, there is also a variety of Old Fashioneds like Apple Jack and Orange Rum.   And if you happen to not be a burger person, they do offer many other kinds of sandwiches and Fish Fry Wednesdays and Fridays."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The cheese curds lived up to their reputation- oh my so good! My husband had taken a coworker from the west coast here for supper.  His coworker had never had a cheese curd.  He took one bite and was hooked, he wondered where they had been all of his life :) My kids thought the house made root beer and macaroni and cheese \"had a different taste.\" The server was happy to bring a replacement. They also have a good beer selection and are known for their old fashioned cocktails."}
{"text":"I had a perfectly respectable meal at The Old Fashioned. Burger, with egg on top, and fries were pretty good and reasonably sized. Some of our friends ordered the cheese sampler and I nibbled on a few pieces, but I'm not much of a cheese-head and my opinion of cheese, or Wisconsin's interpretations of it, was not elevated by anything I tried. I didn't really dig my girlfriend's pulled pork sandwich. It was kind of soggy and the bread didn't seem appropriate. My second fried egg on burger experience, at The Old Fashioned, has made me a fan of that style. The atmosphere is kitschy, but not like a fist to the face. I'd go again."}
{"text":"When I was researching bars to hit up on Madison, The Old Fashioned came up as one of the most reviewed places with the best reviews. Since we were just barhopping, we didn't order any cheese curds here, even though everyone said it was the best. Bummer!  I really like the design of the bar, especially the red lanterns hanging on the ceilings. It definitely gave the bar some personality! The cocktails we ordered were delicious and alcohol heavy, so that's always a win in my book. It's no wonder The Old Fashioned is a downtown staple!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Great Old Fashion. Food is awesome. Especially love the cheese curds."}
{"text":"The first time that I came here, I got a rare burger (forgot what it was called but it's the most basic one) and it was the best burger I ever had.  I did get an old fashioned but didn't like it too much, although I'm not a big fan of alcohol so I can't speak to the quality.   The second time, my burger was a bit overdone from what I asked for.  It was definitely not as good as that first time.    I've been here a couple more times since and the food has been good.  Good burgers and nice staff, but I wish it was a little more consistent.    Also, I had a bowl of soup here once and it was terrible."}
{"text":"Usually very busy on weekend, wait until at least 9 if you want a table. Good food, great drinks. I reccomend getting an order of cheese curds, they have a few good vegetarian options but the burgers are amazing!"}
{"text":"Leaving 5 stars because the service Curt and Nick provided was absolutely impeccable! I'm originally from the south and this was the first state I've visited that I felt true southern hospitality (with an extremely different accent ). I'm a flight attendant and see new places everyday but this will remain one of my favorite places! The fried cheese curds were good and the Cajun sauce that came with it made it even better! I got to try 6 of the local beers which I surprisingly liked each one. OH AND.. the prices are amazing!! I highly recommend this restaurant for the service, beer and food!"}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst. Cheese curds here weren't the best ever (I was expecting better quality since this is the holy ground for cheese). Beer flight came in a cool Wisconsin board. Atmosphere is how you would expect from a pub/casual restaurant. My veggie sandwich I would not get again..."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab breakfast when in Madison. Over 50 taps...so many offerings from breweries within driving distance. I always opt for one of the scramble specials....two slices of lightly toasted artisan bread and rosemary potatoes.  Hungry yet?  The other day I had the basil/pesto with heirloom tomato which was delicious. They offer flights in 4, 8 and 12 3oz. pours I believe.  Basically $1 per sample which can't be beat IMO. Expect a wait if you show up after 9:30 on the weekend.  I can't speak for the weekday, as I have only visited on a weekend."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and wow I'm blown away. It was totally worth the 45 minute wait for the table. The cheese curds are the best ones I have ever tried. The flavor is phenomenal. I ordered the BBQ feed and the meat comes right off the ribs no need for a knife and the flavor is to die for. Also the service is the best I ever had I highly recommend this place to everyone wow!"}
{"text":"Swung by on our trip up to the Dells because I took one look at the reviews claiming \"best cheese curds\" and I was sold. I'd like to think that I'm somewhat of a cheese curd fanatic and these were definitely well at the top of my list. Super tender, melts, and salty. I could have eaten an entire tub!!  For our entrees, we got: - Old Fashioned Burger: delicious! Great bacon and loved the melty egg on top. Perfectly cooked to our preferences.  - Chicken and Biscuits: essentially a broken down chicken pot pie. The chicken was good, but I think the biscuits would have been better toasted and served on the side.   Overall a pretty good meal in the center of Madison!"}
{"text":"Madison is well known for its taverns and supper clubs, and The Old Fashioned is the mother of them all. If you're from out of town, this is one of the places you don't want to miss. Yes, there are as many tourists as locals here, but that doesn't mean you can't get a good meal and have a fun time too. Here are some suggestions based on my recent visit.  1)  Take a clue from the locals and eat early. We were seated quickly at 6:30, but by the time we left at 8:30, the place was jam packed and the wait long.    2)  Get in the mood with a cocktail. I hadn't ordered an Old Fashioned since I hung out with Dan Draper, and I'd forgotten how smooth they can be. Two are even smoother. Three are usually a bad idea. Or try a craft beer from their huge selection.    3)  Check your cholesterol numbers at the door and get the fried cheese curds. A little crispy on the outside, warm and gooey on the inside. This is why you're here... to try something Wisconsin, hey?  4)  Skip the cheese plate... ours was mediocre and served with no presentation. But the grilled cheese sandwich and signature Old Fashioned Burger with a fried egg were both yummy. Our friend from Madison had the trout, which she says is her favorite.     5)  Walk around the Capital Square when you're done eating.  It's historic and right outside the door. And exercise will help repair the damage caused by those fried cheese curds."}
{"text":"We went to The Old Fashioned with high expectations as we had heard so many good things about their food.  Sadly we were let down. Things started out well with a friendly greeting and a short wait.  Our waitress was friendly too but her attentiveness dropped off a bit during the meal.  They were super busy.  The menu is simple and straight forward which we always like. Our meals had some positives such as the fish was done nicely and the grass fed beef for the burger is wonderful.   The negatives were that the soup was just so-so in flavor and so was the coffee.  The fries were ok but cold!  My burger was underdone.  I should have sent it back but didn't.  I asked for medium well and got medium rare to medium. The place is way too crowded for our tastes. I give them some kudos for good ingredients, good menu, nicely sized portions and friendly service.   We will not be going back."}
{"text":"How can you come to Wisconsin and not eat at a place called The Old Fashioned?  And how can you come to The Old Fashioned and not drink an Old Fashioned.  Well, I did both!  This is a pretty popular place so tip no. 1 - Make a Reservation!!!  Otherwise, the wait is pretty long.  We luckily were on vacation and not in a rush so we waited... about an hour.   And this was on a weeknight (we checked in around 6pm).  But luckily, there's a bar, so naturally, I ordered an Old Fashioned.  I've had a few others at other bars, but this place, I liked it.  And I also learned, that I like the Old Fashioned Sweet, not Sour.  So good!  And of course, I had to order the cheese curds and heard they have some of the best.  The cheese curds were great!  We ordered dinner and I had the special, a Jalapeño chowder.  It was great!  The service was awesome.  We had a window seat.  This place was lively, the vibe was nice.  Definitely the place to be.  Oh, and on the way out, I was looking in the glass refrigerator and noticed they sell \"pickled eggs.\"  Sounded interesting so I bought a jar.  Um yeah... AMAZING.   I wish I could order those things!!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend that lives in Wisconsin took me to this place telling me that it's very famous in madison. I ordered the bucky burger, which was juicy and had a lot of flavor. We also had a side of cheese curds and mac and cheese, oh man if there's only one thing you get from here make sure you get those cheese curds!  Tip: there was a little wait, so be prepared! they have a system in place where they will text you when your table is ready so you can walk around downtown."}
{"text":"If I suggest one place to visitors from out of town, it is The Old Fashioned. This is a uniquely Wisconsin deal with good food and an excellent beer selection.  Their menu selection is fair. The sandwiches are decent, salads are only ok, cheese curds are good. The beer selection, however, doesn't disappoint. They boast around 50 taps. You can take your pick of some great Wisconsin beers that are hard to come by elsewhere in Madison (O'so, Pearl Street, Steven's Point, etc).  It is busy on Friday and Saturday nights so plan ahead! Sometimes waits are 1 hour + at these peak times. This isn't a bad place to stop after getting dinner elsewhere. Just arrive after 9pm on weekends."}
{"text":"Whenever someone is from out of town and wants a good, non fancy, reasonably priced eatery and bar, I send them here.  Now I had friends in from out of town, so I sent myself here.  The bar and beer selection is 2nd to none for variety and choices!  Many, many local beers to choose from and each has a nice explanation of what it is.  Myself and two friends each got something different and tried each others.  My Cherry Wheat was the best of course.  The food is great as well.  I always recommend the Mac and Cheese to outsiders and it did not disappoint.  Burgers are great as well.  I went with the beer battered walleye and it was marvelous to the taste.   The service was outstanding as well.  We were in the catching up mode, talking, but not really drinking.  The waitress kept bringing us water and never rushed us to leave, albeit the night was a slow one.  Just a warning that on a Friday or Saturday night, expect an hour plus wait...it's worth it, but just keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Good environment and good drinks. Cheese Kurds are of course the bomb and the beer is great. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"So....the atmosphere is great. They have plenty of bar space (a front room and back room bar area/seating). But there is always a wait to be seated. A lack of seating in my opinion (or just very popular).   I usually opt for the standard Old Fashioned Burger. Really nothing special. A standard burger.  As for the other food options, I just have not had something yet to say \"wow, this is something special! \". It's standard food options you would expect from a Wisconsin Pub/Bar eatery.   I did order a Brandy Slush the last time I was there on a very hot day. I thought it was a awesome bar item that you just don't see too often.  It was great, but was a bit expensive considering I was getting Brandy/OJ/and ice.   Other than this, they do have a nice list of other drinks and beers to choose from, so you definitely will have plenty of drink choices.    This is one place that I just don't have spectacular glowing thoughts about. It's standard good Wisconsin food.  I would agree about the cheese curd debate that seems to be happening on Yelp, whether they are awesome or just subpar. I'm obviously leading toward the subpar people. They are good.....but again like the burgers, nothing to write home about.   Excellent beer/drink specials on certain nights!"}
{"text":"Came here on my first night in WI solo! I sat at the bar when the place was packed (around 6pm..on a Sunday! Lol). I had the bartender choose a drink for me...he chose the Old Fashioned....how convient..lol..but it was really good and gave me a nice little welcome buzz. Then I just had to try the burger (forgot what it was called but it had bacon on it) without egg and of course the CHEESE CURDS...  First the burger....heaven in my mouth. Soo junk the bacon was nice a crispy and flavorful!  Then the cheese curds..mmmmmm...not the best I have had. I was expecting then to be more crispy and the cheese more melted but they were not...I would take away a .5 star for that if I could.  Overall great food and great local WI atmosphere! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary Sundays. Kids welcomed. I love this place after a long walk around the farmers market. Great food service is great. Another gem in Madtown that I often visit."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night without reservations.  We were told it'd be a 3-45 minute wait, and it was certainly towards the upper end of that spectrum.  But they comped us our first round of drinks for waiting patiently, and we weren't even complaining!  Thats pretty sweet service.  Everyone's dishes came out promptly and were rapidly devoured.  The Old Fashioned made a good impression."}
{"text":"This is an EXCELLENT place to sample the craft beers of Wisconsin on draft. Apparently, after speaking to our bartender, the Old Fashioned wants to showcase the area's craft brews. They have a large selection of draft beers on tap including our new Wisconsin favorite, Ale Asylum.   Our bartender -- I believe his name was Billy -- turned us on to Ale Asylum beers. First, he offered us the Bedlam, which I have come learn is only offered for a limited time -- I think it's something like May or June through August. Wow! The Bedlam is a must try!! The Hopalicious was also good. I have a new love for the beers made by Ale Asylum, not to say that other Wisconsin beers aren't good. All the beers here are good, and the Old Fashioned is the perfect place to sample them.  Our bartender was very patient with us. Once we learned that the Old Fashioned showcased mainly (or only) Wisconsin craft brews on tap, and since we aren't from Wisconsin and are very unfamiliar with most of the beers, we put Billy, our bartender, through his paces asking him about -- well, pretty much all of the beers they have on tap. Needless to say, the service was EXCELLENT.   The place is very crowded and tends to be loud, but don't let that deter you from visiting this place.   Upon reading the other Yelp reviews, we tried the fried cheese curds and weren't disappointed.  We look forward to visiting the Old Fashioned again next time we're in Madison. Hopefully, we can get a seat at the bar next time too!"}
{"text":"Came for a late dinner last Friday night. Ordered the cheese curds- they were phenomenal!! Also ordered the house burger, it was delicious! Very cool, Wisconsin-y bar! I loved the old school feeling in there and the food and service were awesome! Not to mention the prices are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Came here on a frigid night in December with a couple of friends, asked for the wait time...45 minutes! The only thing that kept us from just going to another restaurant was how much a friend recommended it...so we decided to stick it out.  After ~30 minutes, we were seated. I went for the old fashioned house burger...and oh man it was the best burger I had in a long time...juicy medium patty, fried onions, garlic sauce, BACON, and a freakin SOFT COOKED EGG that leaks delicious yolk from your mouth every time you bit into it...every bite was better than the one before it......people often say that a burger isn't a good burger if it's not messy....can't be more true! Let me just say that it takes a pretty good burger to impress my taste buds, and right now I'm semi-salivating from just writing this review...  Price for the place was very good. If it wasn't for the wait, this place is a 5 star and I'd come here until I've tried every interesting item on the menu."}
{"text":"This place great for food and drinks! It is a lively-fun restaurant downtown Madison on the capital square. There is usually a wait for tables, but if you don't mind grabbing a drink by the bar then I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for to bring out of town guests to introduce them to Madison and Wisconsin.   Food & Drinks:  The cheese curds are the best in Madison (upon a random taste test of places) and the dipping sauces make it even better. I definitely recommend the garlic or the horsey blue. Great starter to your meal.  The beer cheese soup is another great item, for a side or as a meal. I really like the popcorn which gives it a little bit of a crunch. Very flavorful and savory.  Other than the favorites, I've found the food to be consistently good, regardless of whether it's a fish sandwich, French dip, or a burger. There's a large menu, so you should be able to find something for everyone. Also, check out their specials. Their prime rib is among the best I've ever had  The beer menu is out of this world, with a significant amount of beers in bottles and on tap. They have a special that gives you a good chance to try to the beer of the week for cheap, and have a large variety of Wisconsin beers.  Atmosphere:  Right off the Capital, it's a great place to grab a drink, watch a game, or have brunch after the Farmer's Market. They don't take reservations so it can be a long wait, but grab a buzzer and take a walk around the Capital!  Overall, great Madison staple!"}
{"text":"Probably the most iconic restaurant in Madison. It really captures the essence of the city as it is usually full of a mixture of political hacks, college kids, and large & hungry locals.  Everything thing I have ever tried here is good. They have the BEST cheese curds I have ever eaten though. Simply put, I don't believe it is possible to find better curds than here & I am a curds aficionado. Their beer cheese soup is also exceptional. They have great burgers and sausage & I have always been partial to their fried walleye.   The place is almost as much watering hole as it is restaurant, but if you really want to get the Madison experience, this is your place. Also, get the curds...they will change your life."}
{"text":"Good cheese curds but not as great as some of the mom and pop places farther north.  Nice bar atmosphere and right on the square."}
{"text":"I love their cheese curds. This is our first stop when we get into Madison. We order curds and a pint of Furthermore Knotstock (black pepper pale ale). I dream about these curds. The beer lists here are enviable. They have New Glarus on tap (and not just Spotted Cow). I was served a full pint of the Strawberry Rubarb... and it was a little much for such a sweet beer. I'M NOT COMPLAINING.   Then we move onto the old fashioned... this drink is a concept. Pick your preferences (the menu walks you through) and enjoy!   I love that the food menu has items I do not see often. Its got local fare mixed with the bar staples. The portions are large so either come very hungry, share or be prepared to need a togo box.   TOF has everything needed for a solid 5 stars. The food, the drink, great staff, diverse crowd and perfect location."}
{"text":"A must first stop in Madison, WI. The staff was great and fun. Food was amazing and inexpensive. Sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I love the food. The staff is generally great. But the wait on a Saturday night can be very long. This last Saturday we waited 2 hours and 20 minutes for a table for 4, as we watched them seat larger groups that came in after us. It was a very frustrating experience. We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait as the worse case senario.  That being said, the food is top notch (the best tuna salad sandwich I've ever had!) and the drinks are great."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Kurt makes the best Old Fashioned I've ever had and knows everything there is to know about that wondrous cocktail. The cheese curds are amazing, and I'm working my way through the menu and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Fun Hostess: Good Wait staff/bartenders: (we sat at the bar) Energetic, Knowledgeable and Kind Food: Quick and Spot On! Experience: A solid 10!  I would definitely recommend this place! The overall experience here was amazing and far exceeded that of the Tornado Room (sorry, still a little sour about that one)!  Cheese curds were like little puffs of cheesy air. Heaven like! Fish fry perch, good.  You can't go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Get to this place ASAP. Still my favorite place to drink beer and nosh in Madison. The WI. only beer list is so cool and the food has always been as good as it gets for bar fare. Always busy and parking is a challenge but worth all the effort."}
{"text":"I was driving through Madison and I knew that my only goal for this part of the road trip was eating Wisconsin's best cheese curds. I dare say, mission complete! They were so fresh, hot, greasy, and flavorful! I loved all the different types of dipping sauces too. I enjoyed my salad but my cheese curds were the memorable part. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Madison is an awesome city and the Old Fashioned is a local icon.  Since we were in Wisconsin we decided that we had to sample the cheese curds and I am glad we did because they were awesome!  Service was very friendly and fast despite being busy.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is just way too crowded for the food (average at best) the cocktails (also very average) and the staff who unlike most people in this great city are  than friendly, probably because they are just too busy.  Won't go here again - there are so many better places in Madison!"}
{"text":"Quality true Wisconsin fare. Get the fried cheese curds, or the burger, or the brunch. Excellent beer list. That's all."}
{"text":"great cocktails..great appetizers. this place is definitely a must go  to in madison"}
{"text":"We got there early enough on a Sunday (around 5p), that we didn't have to wait for a table for 6 people. Greeted in a very warm and friendly manner but the waiter and host. The tables outside were already starting to fill in.  Table was a round booth/chair set-up, comfortable and roomy. Plenty of room on the table for condiments, ambiance, menus and table settings. Specials both food and drink were presented to us right away. They had a pitcher of Wisconsinite Beer on special, of course, local beer special - BRING IT! It was about 5 min and the pitcher and glasses were on the table.  It was good and very easy to drink. I had to limit my beer intake to leave room for the food that was going down at this table.  First up FRIED CHEESE CURDS...wow, creamy, steamy and delicious. We got a couple of different dipping sauces. Didn't really need sauce, but towards the end when you struggling to try to finish every last one, the change up of flavor does help. The baskets look small for sharing, but 1 basket is PLENTY for two people, a little goes a long way with these little fried pillows of cheesy heaven.  The entrees were quite sizeable, I had the Old Fashioned Bucky Burger, because it had bacon and egg, of course I had to get it. It was well balanced and prepared. I ate EVERY last bit of it! Using the rest of the buttered bun to clean up the broken yoke from the plate :) mmmmm my favorite.  You could order different types of sides, french fries, potatoes and  if you dare...more cheese curds...  During the feeding frenzy, the waiter, was quick and sly, not intrusive, even some points you realized your glass had been refilled...but How? I didn't even seem him.  Everything so prompt, we didn't feel like we were waiting for anything at anytime.  I wish that I lived in Madison, because I wanted to try breakfast. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The barstaff here are just lovely. Very attentive, and I love how knowledgeable they are on their product.  I had friends in town, and the bartender at the lower bar explained all the fine details on Wisconsin beer, Old Fashioneds, etc. My friends had a great time learning all about it. The bartender even let them sample a bunch so they could get a feel for all the finer nuances of Wisco beer.  That's why I'll continue to take all my out-of-towners here.  The food here is also very good, though I rarely eat here anymore.  I'm a big fan of the chicken (and I usually shy away from chicken because it's not my fav). But theirs is fabulous."}
{"text":"Love their bar.  The best cheese curds I had in Madison. (I'm from SF, and I tried... blush... three different places while I was there.)  Freaking great Spicy Burger. Love this place, good eats!"}
{"text":"Old Fashioned was the first restaurant I visited when I moved to Madison - and after a year of touring all of the tastiness that this city has to offer - Old Fashioned is still my favorite.   Maybe it's the cheese curds, which are hands-down my favorite curds on the isthmus. That paprika dipping sauce is pure YUM.  Maybe it's the atmosphere. Old Fashioned is always bustling - making for a heck of wait for a Friday/Saturday dinner - but it's a worthwhile wait. Old Fashioned has this sort of \"laidback energy\" I've come to associate with the city.  Maybe it's the food. From the Mac and Cheese to the Fish Fry and for every burger and brunch item in between, the food is just good. All of it. All the time.   Maybe it's the drinks. My first time at Old Fashioned, the bartender let us sample a whole flight of local microbrews. This is where my love affair with Lake Louie's Scotch Ale began.   But maybe I like Old Fashioned so much because it's the kind of place I can take out-of-town guests for a slice of the Madison experience. Or at least my Madison experience: Good food. Good people. Good drinks. And most importantly, good cheese."}
{"text":"I really miss this place.  When I lived in Madison, I was a regular here and dragged in every friend and family member as often as possible.  Now I live in Chicago, which has many wonderful things to offer, but 1 thing I cannot find anywhere in this fair city is a really good Old Fashioned.  No, I have therefore learned to make those myself.  But even my own are not quite as good as the Apple Brandy Old Fashioned at... the Old Fashioned.  Their food is good too-- this place has all the other things I struggle to find in Chicago-- the wurst platter, a good fish fry, and cheese curds.  Sigh.  This place showcases the best of Wisconsin."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars just for the cheese curds. I've eaten many a cheese curd in my life - these were the best.  My bourbon old fashioned was tasty. The burger was awesome. The bacon on the burger was even more awesome."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is an absolute must when in Madison, as the throngs of folks lining up to eat here will attest. Seriously, this place is NEVER not busy. Like, never ever.  One reason is the food is terrific (especially the fried cheese curds, beer cheese soup, or any of the Lazy Susans). Another is the extensive beer list. Any WI beer can be found here. Being here actually made me sad that I don't drink beer because it all looked so damn appealing.  Service is extremely efficient and personable, and the patrons are friendly too. It's pretty easy to be cheerful in a place like The Old Fashioned.  Prices are right too. We had a bowel-binding lunch of the afore-mentioned cheese curds, soup, and a Lazy Susan tray of garlic salami, smoked lake trout, deviled eggs, creamed herring, braunschweiger, sharp cheddar cheese spread, as well as beer and cider to wash it all down. All for a reasonable $50 including tip. And it's the kind of filling food that allows you to skip dinner (not that we did) thereby saving you more money!  And whatever you do, get some dusseldorf mustard. It's the best mustard I've ever had. It literally got slathered on everything.   It just wouldn't feel like a proper trip to Madison without at least one meal at The Old Fashioned, and preferably several."}
{"text":"This place has an impressive selection of beers, perhaps overwhelmingly so. Our waitress was very accommodating, though, and explained the menu for us. We also were able to sample our beer before deciding to get a pitcher. We decided on the 2 Women Lager, which was pretty good: nice and light. As for the food I had the Old Fashioned Burger and shared a No. 6 appetizer platter with some friends. Needless to say we came out very full, but the food was quite delicious. I loved the soft cooked egg that topped my burger. It was a bit crowded though, even at 4pm on a Saturday. We had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated, and by the time we were done eating the restaurant was pretty much to full capacity with all the people hovering around the bar."}
{"text":"It's a bit over-hyped.   It is a Madison staple, so if you're a tourist in the market for a tourist destination, this isn't a bad place to go. If you're a local in search of good food, there's better places in Madison.   Their grilled cheese is fantastic. They have perfectly done matchstick fries; they could use some seasoning besides the salt, but the sauce served with them is delicious. The cheese curds OK, you'll love them if you've never had cheese curds before. But if you know your deep fried cheese, you won't be impressed here- cheese is a bit stringy, and the batter quite bland. The brats are definitely over seasoned. If you have good meat, you shouldn't need this much salt. I'm sure they have good meat, so they are doing it a dis-service my smothering the taste. In summery, they over salt and under season otherwise.   There will be a long wait. It is not a calm and laid back environment, at all. This place is bustling, loud, and they could definitely hang some heavy curtains to help with the acoustics. Location is great, right on the capitol."}
{"text":"Food, service, drinks, it's all A+!!!  They have nightly specials that are great. Tuesday night is tacos,, the chicken is amazing"}
{"text":"Honestly the only food I like here is the cheese curds, soup, and fish fry. I find the rest of the food to be nothing special. I actually come to this place for the good beer selection and drinks. They have a huge tap selection of wisconsin beers, and they have a lot of old fashions."}
{"text":"Impressed!  Normally, I will not wait half an hour for a table at a restaurant but based on the recommendation that The Old Fashioned received, I decided to give it a go.  Once we were seated, the service was excellent.  The waiter knew the menu and made good suggestions.  The beverage selection is huge and they have a lot of local items i.e. local root beer.  The food is where they shined though. I had a ribeye and my wife had prime rib.  both were exceptional, especially for the price.  My son got a burger made with local ground beef and Wisconsin cheese and he devoured it.  He gave it two thumbs up.  There are definitely pricier places to go but the bang for the buck here is quite high."}
{"text":"Ooh. Delicious. SO glad I tried the cheese curds here as they were absolutely delicious (the ones I had in Minnesota were also tasty, but these were infinitely better--the real deal). The benedict was good as well as their coffee, too. Great service and maybe it was just because it was during the summer when all the students were out, but no wait earlier on for brunch."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOO many drinks to choose from, great happy hour, terrific food!  We actually ate lunch here the day of my wedding, lol :)  We end up doing a lot of lunches here, when in reality I LOVE dinner so much more (I think the baby keeps us from coming at night), I dream about the rib-eye!!  The sandwiches are great, but after two or three times I'm bored by them...   I LOVE the sauces and of course the haystack onion strings!!!    I've had a couple of the cheese board options and it's pretty dull... I guess I just expect more for the price.  I mean, the portions aren't small but the majority of the cheeses are sub-par with maybe one stand out.  NOT TO MENTION that my server (who I know was not new... we've had him a number of times there, maybe every time) couldn't tell the difference between brie and goat cheese when the kitchen messed up our plate (they did compensate by giving us our goat cheese, which was great, letting us keep the brie and giving us half off... LOVE that management style!).   *** my husband feels otherwise, it's his favorite place for cheese, so it may just be my taste***  It's like ALWAYS busy, which I'm not a big fan of... so we go at odd times and end up in the bar booths.  I love the booths, I hate the horrible service you get in them :(  I will never understand places that don't do table service at off peak times... especially when there were FOUR people behind the bar doing pretty much nothing.   I don't know if I would call it child friendly...it's loud, it crowded and when I asked for a high chair the hostess was visibly annoyed.  I know they have a children's menu, but I would leave the tots at home!  It's def a place we like going back to, but haven't been wowed by the service AT ALL :(    desserts leave me wanting something else, but I don't mind... we just hit up Michael's on the way home :)  Haven't had brunch yet but I'm looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"First time in Madison. Stopped here for dinner based on the reviews. Wasn't disappointed.   Cheese curds were great and one of the best burgers I've had.   The brat was amazing also.   Really liked the onion strings.   Shocked how reasonably priced everything was.   NOT a fan of the cheese spread platter"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner one night while in Madison, WI for the CrossFit Games. We waited over an hour, (text system letting us know when the table was ready was great!), but once we were seated we were a little disappointed.  I'm not sure if we were lead astray by our waiter, or just didn't understand the menu, but the Turkey Sandwich (ordered by recommendation) and Steak Sandwich (another recommendation) just fell way flat. We also ordered some fries for an appetizer, and to be honest, they didn't seem that different from something you'd get at McDonalds. Where was the Wisconsin flair everyone talked about.   Slowly as we saw other plates walk out, we'd realized we ordered wrong. Brats, cheeses, pickles, huge burgers... The more things we saw, the more we realized we just hadn't ordered right. I'm sure this is a great spot, and the locals seemed to be helping pack it out, but we just had a couple of misses.  Next time, skip the turkey sandwich and go for the good stuff. It'll (probably) be worth the calories!"}
{"text":"Very good food...they use local Wisconsin food as available...I had the All Wisconsin breakfast with a brat patty....sauce was so good, I could have eaten a cupful...my son got a Wisconsin bloody mary with beef jerky, pickled egg and pickle....yummy! Very good service on a busy Saturday morning with the farmer's market in progress!"}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype I made my way to The Old Fashioned to see what all the fuss was about. I came here around 10:00 on a Saturday and waited about 15min, not bad. We were seated by hostess at a table near the window (Thank you!! loved the window seat) and given water and utensils right away. Our table was wet and sticky but it didn't bother me too much seeing as to how busy they were.   I, ofcourse, started off with an order of cheese curds which definitely lived up to my expectations. Perfect texture of smooth and cheesy while having a slight crunch to the outside. Yes they were served in a bowl filled with oil but hey, they were still darn good and who am I to be fussy about deep fried cheese lol. We had the cheese curds with a side of the Tiger Sauce which I believe has a horseradish base which tasted okay. It took about 30min for my burger to come but I understood that they were packed and extremely busy. I ordered The Old Fashioned burger. The fries were outstanding. The burger itself was unfortunately slightly disappointing. I LOVE onions. But the onions on the burger tasted off and bland. Plus there was a ridiculous amount of them on my burger. I also didn't care for the egg or the seasoning of the burger itself. On the plus side, it was very meaty, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  Overall If I could rate this place I would give it a solid 3.5. Since that's not an option I rounded up since our server and the service we received was superb."}
{"text":"Tuesday is taco night and they're a buck-fifty each.  Fish fry can't be beat.  The house brew is tasty, and Huber, so automatically awesome.  They serve only Wisconsin beer.  They put popcorn in the soup.  They are meticulous about making this place a Wisconsin cultural gem.  Stellar."}
{"text":"Yet another no-rezzie Madtown restaurant! We called ahead to get the scoop and give them a heads-up re: our requirements, got there at 6:30 after hunting around for handicapped parking, and put our names in for 5 -- two of us being kids and one of us grown-ups in a wheelchair. After being told there was an hour wait, we walked around the Square on a gorgeous Wisconsin summer evening, came back in the recommended 45 minutes, waited around and waited.. finally checked in and were cavalierly told they gave our table away because we weren't there. Needless to say, this did not go over well. If it weren't for the wonderful young Manager Man who got us in spontaneously, albeit to a table in the raucous three-deep Brewer-watching bar.. I would write this place off. Food was pretty good, drinks were ok, curds were good, though a bit on the greasy side, service a little frazzled or maybe just plain unfriendly, and uneven at that. But seriously, the host crew needs a lesson in customer service. Don't break your own rules; it pisses off the masses."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese curds and something else for dinner, probably a burger. The cheese curds were so good I can't hardly remember the entree that I got."}
{"text":"We just recently moved to Madison, and we've been hearing a lot about Old Fashioned. Supposedly they have the best cheese curds in all of Madison so of course we had to check it out.  We arrived around 6:10 pm, and the wait was only 20 minutes, which isn't bad for a restaurant with a reputation of being one of the best in town. Like many modern restaurants they use \"The List\" app so you can watch the wait-list and know if your table is almost ready.  When we were eventually seated the first things I noticed were how loud it was and the dim lighting. I understand that The Old Fashioned is a bar, but this was \"can't even hear yourself think\" levels of noise, let alone hear the other people at the table.  The service was more than adequate but nothing stand out. Our drinks were kept topped off, and the server checked in often enough. Luckily we had all been looking at the menu when we were waiting so we were able to put an order in right away.  We ordered a round of drinks, deep fried cheese curds, and some burgers. The Old Fashioned has an impressive selection of beers. They have 40 beers on tap and even more in bottles, as well as, an interesting selection of old fashions. I do wish that their tap list was more descriptive, Many of the items on the list just had the name of the beer with city/state of origin, and there didn't appear to be any type of order to the list. Like things were not clustered together. Tell me what kind of beer it is! I don't want to ask about 40 beers to find the best fit for my pallet.  With that said, both of the beers (Black is the New Orange - chocolate/orange flavored lager & Warped Speed Scottish Ale) I ended up ordering were on point. I appreciate being able to order some solid craft beers I haven't had before.  The deep fried cheese curds were not as amazing as people lead me to believe, but they weren't awful. I do not think they deserve the title of \"the best in Madison.\"  They were VERY greasy and lukewarm when t hey arrived at the table. The breading was very light and the cheese was gooey, which is a good thing. I just can't overlook the amount of grease and below expected temperature. At this point I would give the honor of best cheese-curds to Graze, but our hunt for \"the best\" continues. Old Fashioned, your cheese curds let me down like Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.  I ordered a Wisconsin Burger for the main course, and my wife ordered an Old Fashioned Burger. Both burgers were ordered medium, but we received burgers that were more like medium-well. There was no detectable pink left in the burger. Regardless, the burgers were very juicy, and the cheese was plentiful and absolutely coating the burger. It was a little greasy, yes, but it's a burger. When I order a burger that has this much cheese on it, please just cram the fat into my arteries. I can honestly say, while a simple burger, the Wisconsin Burger delivered by Old Fashioned meets my expectations for a good burger. It was one of the best burgers I have had in some time, regardless of being served more on the well side than requested.  On the topic of the bathrooms, why are they so small, considering the size of a crowd that the establishment is pulling in? There shouldn't be so much waiting in the men's room of a bar.  Overall, The Old Fashioned delivered a massive beer list that is not for those who have trouble making decisions and dang good burgers. If you really have a taste for cheese curds, go for it, but I know you could do better else where. I would come for the meal and leave for drinks elsewhere because a conversation is fairly difficult here."}
{"text":"Yesterday after a long absence I stopped in for lunch at the Old Fashioned.  This was a mistake, and not because the tuna salad tasted singularly flavorless, even with the hard boiled egg slices and pimento garnish.    The irritant was my server, who appeared to be suffering from a raging case of gender bias.  During my meal, she managed to address me as \"hon\", \"sweetheart\", and \"my love\".  Yet the male customer seated to my left was not subjected to any of this borderline harassment and condescension by her.  One could almost think that this waitress with the tattoos on her forearm was either trying to pick me up or is amazingly clueless.    Either way, I am not setting foot inside this creepy establishment again."}
{"text":"Loved the food and drink menu....service could use some work!  Hubby and I ventured to The Old Fashioned while our son attended a football camp at Wisconsin.  Based on the high ratings we thought we would give it a try.  We were seated without a wait even though it was a packed house.  It took a long time for our server to get to us to get our drink order.  Even so, the drink menu looked amazing, especially you guessed it their Old Fashioned's.    My hubby was really craving a BLT and asked if they could put some bacon on their grilled cheese with some tomato.  It wasn't that they said no, it was how they said no.  Our server was just kind of snotty (it turns out  they do not have tomatoes there, which if she had just said that....it would have been cool).  Anyway from the person who seated us, the man who brought and refilled water, and our server; were all kind of grumpy and miserable.  Food was good, not amazing but I liked it! Probably wouldn't go back though because of the service!"}
{"text":"So we have been here for dinner a couple times and the food is great. We went for lunch yesterday and how they have it set up is horrible. They took us to our table and we waited and waited for our server who then came up and rudely told us to order at the counter like I says in the menu. Well hello to you too. Soooooo we waited again st the bar to have our order taken and you pay then and tip if using your credit card. I tipped 20 percent....now I have no idea who earned that one since we did not see our server again till the end of our meal when our drinks had not been refilled and we had to randomly stop and ask someone for to go boxes. This weekly lunch set up provides the worst service ever. They do have a great beer selection and their fish and tuna sandwiches are great. Please just provide regular lunch service like every normal restaurant."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love this place? Classic sconnie experience. Get the pickle plate lazy Susan or one of the cheese plates. Oh, get everything. And get a tall Brandy Slush. Shhhh don't argue, just do it."}
{"text":"We stopped here last night for drinks on our way to Tipsy Cow for dinner.  Honestly, if there was only one restaurant you could ever eat at you would probably have to pick this place....I mean, they have everything....great apps, salads, and steaks/burgers/fish etc. along with breakfast.  I actually didn't think to eat dinner here last night because they are normally SOOOO busy!  Anywayz....we had cheese curds along with long island ice teas.  Ya....we were feeling no pain as we were leaving.  The bartender made the comment, \"here you go, these are the real deal\" and they were strong and delicious!!  Yes....he got a good tip.  :D  P.S.  Old Fashioned people:  Please open another restaurant on the east side!!"}
{"text":"Best curds in town! Place gets pretty packed with folks at dinner and it's a bit spendier compared with a similar establishment off of the square... good comfort food and cocktails.   Fish Fry on Friday is excellent!"}
{"text":"Cheese curds, Tiger sauce, burgers with an egg on it: the Wisconsin college town trifecta. I don't quite know what's in the Tiger sauce (I think it's a bleu cheese/ranch mixture, but who knows or cares... It's amazing), but you need to get it on everything.  I used to frequent this hotspot every time I visited my sister at UW, and this was always our post-bar stop. Whether your night ends at 11 p.m. (no judgements) or 2 a.m., Old Fashioned's cheese curds are awaiting you with open arms.  Whether you're there for the beer or a mixed drink (brandy slushes are a must-have in the summer), Old Fashioned is your one-stop-shop for Capital fun."}
{"text":"One star for the cheese curds and awesome homemade ranch. One star for the super sweet server. One star for the great atmosphere. I want to give more, but I can't.   After circling the blocks for quite a while, we finally found a place to park. This made the start of our visit a rough one. While driving back from MN to IL, we wanted dinner and I wanted to try the cheese curds that everyone was talking about. So my husband appeased me and drove around trying to park the car. Once we finally did, I was thrilled that we did not have to wait for a table.   We ordered the cheese curds right away with the buttermilk ranch. They were good. Not the best I've ever had, but better than Culver's. The ranch was fabulous!    My hubby ordered chili on spaghetti. It was dry and completely underseasoned. Even two weeks later when I asked him about it for this review, he said how disappointed he had been.   I opted for the Sunday special. A half chicken with mashed potatoes, roasted parsnips and carrots and stuffing/dressing. The chicken was seasoned nicely. The skin was flabby instead of crisp. The mashed potatoes were very good. The parsnips and carrots were my favorite part. The dressing was meh. Sadly, nothing was very hot. We just wanted to get home so we didn't complain, paid our check and called it a day.   Can't say that I'll bother going back which I guess is okay because I can't see ending up in the area again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I moved from Madison a couple of years ago but I'm telling you, every now and then I get a huge craving for cheese curds and The Old Fashioned has hands down the best fried curds known to man. When/if I win the lottery, I'll be sure to fly to Madison on a regular basis just so I can have these curds.  I love this spot because it reminds me of everything that I loved about living in Madison. The midwest charm, good beer and other drinks, and the food!  I am surprised I didn't leave Madison by crane after the weight I gained.  Everytime I go back to Madison, I always make an effort to get at least one meal there.    I usually vary up my menu items every time I go which is rare. The fish fry is excellent but a bit overcrowded and that is a little distracting. I guess when you have it so good, you have to expect it get as busy as it does.  TL;DR Before I die, serve me a plate of fried cheese curds from The Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"This is my first proper Midwestern meal in a Midwestern town. I was meeting a friend for dinner, and she recommended here as my debut into the cuisine of Madison. Indeed, The Old Fashioned achieved that admirably. The beer selection was capacious, and I had cheese curds that I believe to be both delicious and probably authentic. I ordered the Old Fashioned burger - beef patty, crunchy bacon, veggies, an egg on top - but I had requested medium rare and it came more like a medium well-done. Also the fries on the side were somewhat soft and tasteless. I would peg this institution more as a social gathering place where a group of friends share a beer instead of a wholehearted restaurant dedicated to the art of fine food."}
{"text":"5 stars for the cheese curds, 3 stars for the hours. Closes a little early Sunday-Tuesday (which are prime days when you are in town for a week long conference) But come for the curds. They are amazing!   Bonus: get yourself an Old Fashioned with brandy sweet, thank me later."}
{"text":"Cheese curds and Old Fashioneds to die for. There is a reason almost every photo taken is of the curds, old fashioneds, and burgers. We started with the curds, which were some of the best I have ever put in my face, and I have done that a lot in my life, so that's saying something. I had the grilled veggie sandwich, which was amazing. Loved the bread and the goat cheese/olive tapenade set the whole sandwich off. My husband got the Old Fashioned burger, which he was extremely happy with. We sat at the bar and met a nice couple who have been married for 51 years! They were both enjoying the fish sandwich, which would be my order next time we stop in. Hopefully we will be having a meal there in 50 years as well! Here's the thing. About 2 years ago we tried to eat here and there was a 2 hour wait. Life is too short for that ridiculousness, but come early and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"I love that the food is sourced locally and exemplifies the great work that Wisconsin people put into their food.  The cheese curds are amazing, the variety in Old Fashions is overwhelming, and the cheese plates are my favorite.  If I could, I would eat here daily!"}
{"text":"Local watering hole specializing in 'the old fashioned', a classic cocktail from back in the day. With about a dozen variations, along with many, many good Wisconsin microbrews, this is where you go to get some beer and brats. Forget State Street Brats, which is generally overrun with college football goons trying to pickup on anything that moves, go here and get one of their good sandwiches, their salad, with brandy vinaigrette (yum), or the sausage sampler platter - one Sheboygan bratwurst, (pork or pork & beef) one knackwurst (smoked beef), and one weissewurst (veal) served on a plate with mustard and sauerkraut. This is a great way to take in the local, German fare, and appreciate the fact that great meat and great beer goes hand in hand. Trust me - the Germans can't be wrong!"}
{"text":"Holy wow!   I've always tried to come for breakfast on the weekend and the wait is always crazy long .  I finally got smart and came at two on a weekday to try their lunch instead . No wait this time and we were seated next to the window so we could enjoy the beautiful view of the Capitol. As recommended by everyone and their mom we tried the cheese curds ... And they were worth the hype . The cheese nuggets weren't over breaded like most places seem to do . They did seem to be a little greasy but it's not grease from the fryer. It's more like cheese grease from the cheese being so fresh and warm ( if anyone has melted cheese on a plate in the microwave as a kid you'll know what I'm talking about ).  All appetizers come with one sauce and you can add more on for 50cents.   For our lunch meals we each ordered burgers; house burger and the spicy burger . Both were amazing and had its own unique flavor. Each was paired and sauced with the perfect flavor buddy combination . What stood out to me the most was the beef patty itself . It had great spice , great quality ingredients and was cooked to the correct medium rare . I'm from Milwaukee and I would take these burgers over soblemans and Aj bombers any day .   This place could easily charge $10-$12 per plate but they don't . I was amazed that we got a full lunch plus an appetizer for under $30.   I will be back for their breakfast soon !"}
{"text":"Maybe the drinks are the appeal, but for this guy, it was a touristy place with average food in an aging atmosphere. Fair prices and good selection however, so if you're downtown and want some regional fare, this place isn't so bad."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and a decent crowd for noon on a Friday. They have lots of beer choices, which is a plus. I ordered the beer cheese soup to start and it was delicious; I would definitely recommend. However, for lunch I ordered the prime rib sandwich and was very underwhelmed. I thought this would be a safe choice considering the atmosphere and I heard the person next to me order it, but the flavor was bland, it had grease dripping out and overall just expected a bit more. The saver of the meal was definitely the cheese curds! Would highly recommend the cheese curds with the garlic dipping sauce. Yum! Overall it was a nice atmosphere, average service, and tasty soup and cheese curds. I would come back but strictly stick to the small plates and beer."}
{"text":"I agree with Tim B.  The best cheese curds in town and fail-safe.  I always have a good time and good conversation here (though be forewarned, it's loud!).  I dig the scene and the ambiance, the drinks are *very* affordable and flow readily (great beer specials & I love their old fashioned!).  No. 20 is delicious -- can't go wrong with Door County cherries -- and the salad seemingly offsets the inevitable amount of cheese curds and alcohol I will consume at this venue.  Though I have been known, on occasion, to order the grilled cheese with bacon.  Shame.    The service is potentially spotty -- especially on Friday and Saturday nights.  In fact, on one occasion I'm quite sure our waitress was completely stoned.  Water refills are also hard to come by sometimes.  That said, I've never waited more than 20 minutes even with large parties.    And the apple pie with a slice of Hook's aged cheddar?  Don't pass it up."}
{"text":"What an awesome place!  Old fashioned's were up to quality and I had the \"spicy burger\" which was cooked medium, exactly what I wanted, with bacon, jalapenos, and pepperjack cheese, very good.  Overall, I will definitely be stopping back the next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here, but the namesake drink is great, and the $1.50 Hamms and other legacy beers are even better when you're drinking on a budget."}
{"text":"Out of my week long business trip this was the best place I had dinner. On a Tuesday night it was still a 25 minute wait for a table. The atmosphere was lively. The staff was friendly. It had a lot of charm for a bustling tavern/pub.  The cheese curds were amazing. The sliced battered onion strings were great. This is not diet food. The appetizers and entrees are big, heavy, cheesy, and probably fried. Given I had a burger the night prior I went with Mac & Cheese with bacon. I got a huge bowl of pasta with a super creamy cheese sauce. It was covered in bacon crumble. Yummy! My coworkers both went with burgers and reported favorably on them. The price point was perfect.  The alcohol menu was huge...8 pages worth. This is clearly a beer drinker's haven. This the kind of place you could go to for dinner and spend the night socializing. If you live in Madison you have probably gone here. If you are visiting the area, do yourself a favor, adjust your belt one notch or two, and try it out. Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Supremely sub-par.  Yeah...they have fried cheese curds - it's Wisconsin - there will be cheese curds.....and they'll probably be good...anywhere. It's not a testament to the Old Fashioned - it's a testament to Wisconsin's quality of cheese. I had the fried fish special and felt like I'd ordered Van de Kamp's. Too loud - too long to wait. Tried the burger as well, which was recommended to me as one of the best in the city. I do not agree. Whether or not they put a fried egg on stuff...it's not superior.  You can put perfume on a carp - it's a carp. Hype."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at the Old Fashioned. This is probably THE go-to place for someone who wants good \"old fashioned\" Madison food. I ordered a chicken sandwich that was juicy and tender, and my husband ordered a burger. The serving sizes were huge! It was really too much for us to finish. But we loved it. Of course we ordered cheese curds. We both found we did not love cheese curds. We liked the curds, but didn't love them. Given we are not native to Madison, and this was the only place we went to for cheese curds on our short trip, it's hard to evaluate whether the issue is we just are not massive cheese curd fans, or if it's Old Fashioned-specific. Anyway, that is the reason for the four stars instead of five. But we really did enjoy this establishment and would recommend to others who are in the area."}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet as we only had a beer here before wandering back to the hotel. A college friend recommended we check it out as a \"must-do\" Madison experience, and I can definitely see what she means. While we didn't try them, she also said that the cheese curds are the best.   The atmosphere is fun and the bartender was amazing. He happily poured me sample after sample to help me find the right beer for me, and we chatted a bit about the Madison beer scene. They have a really good beer selection and if I lived in Madison I could definitely see myself here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The old fashioned was the first real downtown restaurant my fiancé and I ate at since moving here last week and we were not disappointed! We got there around 6:15 on a Saturday and there was about a 45 minute wait. The nice part was that they took your phone number to text you when your table was ready, and even were hooked up with an app where you could check your place in line - super helpful for being able to kill some time on capital square or state street without losing your table.  Wait time was as predicted, and the indoor decor was awesome. Lots of signs and decorations that were specific to Wisconsin. Inside of restaurant was clean and crowded but well organized.   Beer list was awesome - all Wisconsin beers on tap, and a full bar that specialized in Wisconsin old fashions. I got the old fashioned burger and loved it! The meat was good and it wasn't so big that you wanted to die after. My fiancé got the regular burger and cheese curds and was very satisfied with his meal. Service was decent especially given how busy they were, and prices were outstanding given how good the food and atmosphere was! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Always come when daughter from L.A. is in town. This time the service was especially good: outdoor seating was closed but it was a gorgeous day and they said they'd let us sit anywhere (a rare Monday at 2:30 p.m. with no crowds). Loved people watching and seeing friends walk by sitting on the sidewalk. We always  get an Apple Jack Old Fashioned to start: amazing. Their Happy hour 2-for-1 from 3-5 pm is amazing, because their Old Fashioneds already are a deal at $5.50-$6.50. Always get the curds with garlic aoli: they never disappoint. Burgers and soups also are great: we split the beer and cheese with popcorn because it's so rich. My daughter also loves the beer flights. The Old Fashioned is a fixture for the Capitol Square."}
{"text":"Fun place. Great drinks and service. Found the food to be on the greasy side, especially food from the fryer. Maybe oil should be hotter, maybe food should drain better after cooking.  There should be a fix for a neat place like that...."}
{"text":"I have dined at the Old Fashioned more times than I can count. The food is always delicious and they have a fantastic beer craft beer menu. Most nights if you are looking for dinner the place is packed and you can expect a wait. If you are looking for more of a relaxed atmosphere, I would recommend going for lunch if you are in the downtown area.   The reason why I did not give them 5 star review is because of the following. It is VERY loud in the restaurant and makes it kind of difficult to have a conversation. On a busy night, you are seated very close to other tables, which again makes it even harder to have a conversation. If you are waiting for your seat, you typically have to squeeze your way up to the bar (mind you they have 2 bars in this restaurant and both are packed). If you are not seated at the bar you feel like you are in the way of the servers or standing too close to people dining at a table.   With all that said above, I still would recommend The Old Fashioned to anyone looking for great food, and good beer."}
{"text":"It's trendy, and the menu is huge, yet somehow everything on it is good to great. Recommended for brunch especially. The coffee is notably above average, which is appreciated."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Amazing beer selection and it's cheap.  Love the Wisconsin feel.  Cheese curds are amazing."}
{"text":"I love cheese! I mean real cheese. I love beer! I mean good microbrews. After taking the tour of the beautiful Wisconsin Capitol, we stumbled upon the menu of this great american classic restaurants. The menu is typical american bar food but... They use Wisconsin cheeses and serve tons of microbrews. The special on tap is so inexpensive! Just awesome. We wanted to try everything that add the combo Cheese + Beer so... In winter, it is a great place to get your calories up after loosing them all in the cold.  We tried:  House-made fresh Wisconsin beer battered cheese curds: Great curds. The batter is crunchy and tasty. There are a little oily but you know it is fried food. Challenge achieved the dish had Cheese and Beer.  Wisconsin beer cheese soup garnished with popcorn: We just had to have it as it is a specialty of the region. It was heavy but really good. Challenge achieved the dish had Cheese and Beer. (Obviously)  The Old Fashioned House Burger: It is a grilled over fire and topped with fried onions, Bavaria's hickory-smoked bacon, aged Cheddar, garlic sauce and a soft-cooked egg on a buttered and toasted roll. It is a massive burger. I love eggs on burger! The meat was good, the cheese great. The flavors were bold and strong. The egg could have been a it better. Overall a great burger. So this dish did not have beer in it but we drank beers with it so it kind of counts.  Cheese and Beer for every course: Mission Accomplished.  In Wisconsin bars, you receive a card with 100 microbrews listed. You get a stamp every time you try a different beer. Too bad I was just visiting."}
{"text":"Where to start?  As the name implies, the Old Fashioned has a wide assortment of mixed drinks that are all flavorful and unique.  They're easily one of the most fun bars in Madison.  The food is underrated though.  That is where you will find some simple modifications to standard bar favorites that will have your head swirling.  Garlic Aioli dipping sauce for fries, Old Fashioned Burger with a fried egg, and Cheese Curds with tiger dipping sauce are just a few examples of their simple modifications to tasty favorites.  They execute them to great effect!    A great place for a Friday night dinner and start to the bar hopping."}
{"text":"Crappy food, can't cook a burger med rare ever! Just ask for it well done. Cheese curds are greasy and no flavor of beer at all."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a recent Friday and the place was hopping.  Love the atmosphere.  We got there early, good thing too.  The goofy system of having to order and pay at the bar is a pain in the butt and confusing.  But I loved my beer battered walleye.  And the staff is exceptionally friendly.  Will be back."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a gorgeous environment to admire the spectacular ceiling and unwind with a plate of the best Mac & Cheese I've ever had the only bologna I've ever truly enjoyed.   Highly recommended if in Madison, and plan to go back next time I'm by the capitol."}
{"text":"First thing I want to say \"HOLY CRAP AMAZING CHEESECURDS LIFECHANGER\"  Actually, my first introduction to the cheese curds was at Taste of Madison.  After trying a friends', I went back the second day to get a full serving for myself.  The curds are unlike any fried cheese curds I've had before as they are fresh curds that are breaded at the restaurant.  I'm not even normally into fried cheese curds.  As for the rest of the food, it is also good.  My parents from out of town commented that they thought it was exceptionally good and also reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I have no justifiable excuse for not coming here more often.  Service is always fast and friendly.  They have a great assortment of beers as well as some of the better old fashioneds in Madison.  And their food, always solid with their cheese curds being some of the best in Madison.  Yes, it's been written up on every blog and website and their awards are well deserved.  And with that comes droves of tourists and locals taking their out of town guests.  While there is nothing wrong with that, the sheer mass of humanity inside can be overwhelming and with the amount of other options on the Square, Old Fashioned falls to the bottom of the list.  But I would be foolish to hold the success of the restaurant against them.  Come.  Eat.  Take it all in.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really don't know why it took me so long to finally come to The Old Fashioned. I owe my friends an apology for not coming sooner!  I had the No.30 with cheese curds and an old fashioned. I still love Curd Girl's cheese curds more, but these are a very close second. The burger though, wow. They definitely know how to do an egg burger well. It's on par with the Mountie Burger at the Dane, if not better. I'm thrilled to have found it since the Dane just changed their menu and got rid of the Mountie. The Old Fashioned is definitely going to become my new late night burger place. I could go on a rant about the sweet brandy old fashioned I had, but I'm sure there's a long list of other reviewers who have done the same. Save us both the time and just order it! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Great food, great drinks, great fun!   One great thing about the Old Fashioned is it's location. It's on the Capitol Square so it doesn't draw too many college kids. Another great thing are drink specials. Every month, they feature a different beer for glass or pitcher which are often pretty cheap. The bar has most Wisconsin beers on tap or bottle, too. The bloody mary's are spectacular, especially if you get it with the peppered infused vodka.   The food is great. Cheese curds are an obvious must. I usually end up getting the build-your-own burger with extra pickles (FANTASTIC pickles) and fries. Fries are also amazing. I've also tried the mac n cheese (it was good, but I wouldn't get it again) and the grilled cheese sandwich (pretty good). The chili is good, but because it's Green Bay chili it's more meaty than bean-y and has noodles in it. The breakfast is also delicious. I've had one of the scramblers and the waffles and both were spectacular.   The Old Fashioned is a great place to bring in out-of-towners for a great Wisconsin experience or a great place to just enjoy great food."}
{"text":"My number 1 favorite restaurant ever. Love the house brew and the $2.50 pints. Best burgers ever. Best curds ever. Awesome food all around. Great atmosphere. All my friends and family request a visit to Old Fashioned when they're in town."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds in Madison. Get them to go with a Tiger Sauce (horseradish) - this place is always packed and loud."}
{"text":"I came here during a business trip and sat at the bar and ordered the beer battered walleye sandwich and a side of fried cheese curds. I was really tempted to get the burger, but I've never had fried walleye and decided this will probably be my only chance to try it. I was so happy with my decision. The piece of fish was huge and the shredded cabbage complimented it very well. Get the cheese curds and ask for a side of the chipotle pepper dip, it gives it a nice kick. I came here at 6:30pm on a Wednesday night and there was a 30 minute wait for a table of one. This place gets busy so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"We came here since supposedly they have the best cheese curds in town. To my taste Graze's curds are better since they're not quite so heavy, but these are excellent nonetheless. We got a lazy Susan as well. We had seen great reviews about charcuterie here and the server told us they must be talking about that, but it's not offered during lunch (and that often people will come in asking for stuff they saw on Yelp that they don't actually have?). They made an exception and made it for us anyway. Delicious.   Server did not seem super pleased to be serving us from the moment she came over. Though it's a family friendly restaurant, we couldn't help but feel the annoyed glares pointed towards our toddler.... Including from the server. But we don't necessarily expect everyone to love kids, so whatever. The beer selection is fabulous and we would definitely go back for that and more lazy Susan, though perhaps at night and without a little."}
{"text":"It seems foolish to even write a review. You know when you walk in the door and their are bus loads of people that a place is good. So why didn't I give them 5 stars? I hate to wait - if you are this busy, knock out a wall, ban Illinois people, do what it takes to get people served in a more comfortable environment. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Every now and then, a food experience so freakin' good it borderlines on an almost religious experience comes along.  Today was that experience for me. Tomorrow, I get to have a combined root canal and impacted wisdom tooth surgery and I wanted a nice meal in advance of what I know will be shakes, smoothies, ice creams, and soups for the next few days.  So what do I do? I come to the place I've been dying to go to ever since I've heard about it. I sit down and the service is, off the bat, great and pretty quick (though, not a lot of people were there around 2pm on a Thursday.) I get a Baumeister's root beer (I'm sure the alcoholic beverages are great--but I can't justify having alcohol a few hours after waking up.) It's fantastic, but this isn't what I'm here for.  A little while later, I got the house burger with the famous cheese curds all you guys rave about on here.  Look, I'll be frank: I'm not a huge fan of the eggs on the burger. After Nitty-Gritty's crap, I was a little scared. But this burger? It was like paradise. In my mouth. In the best possible way. It gave the burger a really peppery taste in addition to the quality of the grassfed beef. Most of the time, you don't really taste the burger, but the sauces--oh no. I got the burger. And it was magical.  The cheese curds--here's where I was stupid. I didn't get the dipping sauces. I don't know why, but I didn't. Alone and naked, they were unbelievable.  Overall, for the TL;DR version: It was amazing. Go. But don't be too long because I'll be back and I'll shank you for a seat at this place just for scraps."}
{"text":"Great cheese curds and custom service! I also love the setting."}
{"text":"Review is for bar only. Came here with a group on a Friday evening. We were in between waiter transitions but they were very nice about it. Decent selection of drinks and on-tap options. I'm a huge cider fan and they only had bottled varieties. Decent prices and didn't have any trouble getting a seat in the evening. I believe they do ID you regardless of whether you are getting food or not past 11 P.M. but don't quote me on that.  Edit: Cheese curds are good here. They do live up to the hype and are worth trying."}
{"text":"I had read so much about The Old Fashioned, but it was a big letdown during my visit to Madison. I ordered the trout, and it was awful - for $20, all I got was a flavorless piece surrounded by a horde of spinach and radishes (I didn't ask for a salad!). Considering how good the reviews are, I suppose the rest of the menu might be decent, but please don't order the trout (unless you don't have an appetite) if you visit."}
{"text":"Wow!  We had lunch here and came back for dinner, it was so good.  The House Burger must be seen to be believed.  Ask for more napkins if you order it; you'll need them.  Great onion strings, too.  We did think the cheese curds at the Capital Tap Haus were better than the Old Fashioned's, but B+ isn't bad, right?"}
{"text":"Good food, lots of options and fast service!  Extensive beer menu that goes on for ever! Rather cramped inside and is always packed! Management is what is keeping this from a 5 star. They have to open the up stairs and hiring more staff! ! Ridiculous wait times are common."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best sit-down restaurants in the downtown area of Madison. I've been here three times, each time trying a different food item. The salad was great, and that's coming from somebody who doesn't care to eat salads. Only downside was that I had to spend an extra $2 to add chicken. The burger was cooked exactly how I asked. Unfortunately, it was a bit messy, but when you order a burger with an egg on top you're asking for it. The last food item I tried was the bacon macaroni and cheese. It was honestly the best mac and cheese I have ever had and I would not hesitate to order it again. The service I've had has been anywhere from good to outstanding. There was never any reason to stiff anyone on a tip or anything, just small things that make a good server a great server, if you get what I mean. There were three downsides I found in my visits. First, the wait time is incredibly long on Friday nights. Granted, I went on Friday night, but they have an upstairs and multiple rooms downstairs so I felt like it could've gone a little faster. It was estimated 90 minutes and took about 60. The other two times I went on a Friday at 9pm and a Sunday at 8pm and had immediate seating both times, so the wait time isn't a huge knock. I would recommend trying to call ahead of you have a group over four people. The second issue I had was parking. Because it's on the square, there isn't really great parking. I had to park in a ramp on King Street when I had people visit, which sucks, because that costs money in addition to my bill. Try to park on campus and walk half a mile. The last thing I had an issue with was ordering from the bar and not being able to combine my bill with my bar tab. After we paid for our food I had to go to the bar to pay for the drinks separately, and I feel like I should have been able to combine them.  All in all, I'd give 4.5 stars if I could. Can't justify 5 stars because of the reasons listed above, but one of my favorites in Madison. It's great for bringing friends to when they visit from out of town, and it's worth a decent wait time. Also, the alcohol menu is huge. Lots of draft and bottled beers, wine, house cocktails, everything really."}
{"text":"Well I love their hamburgers and their old fashioned's. I like the decor and well what more do you want?"}
{"text":"I arrived in Wisconsin today for the first time and headed straight for The Old Fashioned. I'm glad that I did. I had eaten an heavier meal earlier today, so I wasn't as hungry as this restaurant requires. The portions are huge, and the prices are reasonable. But if you're looking for a comprehensive beer menu with a range of Wisconsin brews, and some great food like cheese curds and burgers to accompany, this is your place. And you cant' beat the location: right across from the State Capitol. The cheese curds were delicious, but not too greasy, and I loved my cup of chili served midwestern style with spaghetti, cheese, sour cream, meat sauce and onions. I chose a Hef beer for my brew. My bartender server was excellent, and the people here really nice in addition to the tasty food. I recommend the Tiger Sauce for your condiment choice."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in the door, you begin to understand Pavlov's theory.  The aroma from the wood fired grill is fantastic, and a precursor of what is to come.  Large open restaurant with a relaxed feel to it.  Fantastic selection of WI beers.  Devote following of locals, and plenty of tourists fill the restaurant.    I decided I wanted to skip the infamous cheese curds, and go with a selection of WI's finest cheeses.  Cheeses were delicious.  Part way though my board I noticed some landjaegers.  Dried hanging meat at a bar.....must have.  Not sure exactly what they were, and falling somewhere in between not caring and not wanting to know what they are made of, they were delicious and are a welcome pairing with the cheese board.  With the name Old Fashioned, I had to have one.  How could you not?  I didn't realize the variety of Old Fashioned's that they had.  I started traditional, but after seeing a sign on the wall I had to try a Korbel Old Fashioned.  How could more than 575,000 people be wrong.  They weren't -   Bartender was a bit of a dud, seeming to have more of a desire for the night to end, than to serve,  Hoping it was just an off night.    I would gladly return for one of their specialties, especially their fish fry."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat if you're visiting Madison. There's an extensive beer list, and Madison-specific menu items, like the beer and cheese soup and of course, cheese curds. Both were delicious. In fact I have no complaints about the food. The service was fast and friendly. Just be prepared to wait if you're going on the weekend - we waited 45 minutes for two people on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Always a solid choice of restaurants and it has long been a favorite of mine. Walleye sandwich is one of my favorite things but I literally have never had a bad food item here. Great cheese curds and great lunch specials, especially in the summer. Usually a big of a wait but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Go for the beer, they've got a huge selection of taps. The food is mediocre. The cheese curds suck. They are in no way, shape, or form the best as people would have you believe."}
{"text":"Bar Area: 4/5-Stars  Restaurant Table Seating: 2-Stars  Came in here for dinner on a recommendation from friends. There was a wait, so we went to the bar to kill some time. This place was packed and lively.  The bartender was wildly knowledgeable about the beers on tap, which were exclusively from Wisconsin. A big plus in my book. They go so far as to map out the breweries with their location in the state within the beer menu. Good variety of styles. We were able to sample just about as much as you wanted be a free splash or a tasting flight. Tasting flight was nicely arranged on a custom wooden paddle in the shape of Wisconsin with numbers for ease of identification.  Once we were seated, I took a look at the menu and was pretty shocked to not find much that looked appetizing. It seemed to be a lot of heavier junk food. I decided to go with a burger variety. Appetizer of fried cheese curds was quite good and generously portioned. But our service at the table was quite poor with hardly any check-ins or water refills. The HVAC system overhead was dripping water onto my wife, so we mentioned it to the server. She seemed to cursively acknowledge this with a \"thanks for pointing it out\" instead of a \"wow, that's disgusting, let me find you another table immediately.\"  For a place with over 100 patrons at a time, I found the single-use toilet bathroom design to be ridiculous.   I was a bit underwhelmed, so was encouraged to try their signature Old-Fashioned cocktail. Much too sweet for me.  Overall, disappointed."}
{"text":"Relaxing and comfortable atmosphere and good food. Had a seasonal special, Heirloom Tomato BLT, and it was great. Will be back."}
{"text":"The prices are kind of expensive and ordering can be a little confusing but the food is GREAT!  I absolutely love the deep fried cheese curds with the paprika sauce.  Going to the Old Fashioned is a special treat."}
{"text":"I like there cheese plate. Yummy. I don't know they get their cheese but nothing like the plater. So yum"}
{"text":"If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!! The staff, the food, the atmosphere, and the drinks all deserve 5 stars! I have never had a negative experience here.   The food is amazing. Burgers are seasoned so deliciously and they reheat very well the next morning! (I'm eating one right now!) Their salads are portioned very largely - perfect for sharing.   One of the biggest reasons I keep coming back is the staff. They are perfectly attentive (not overbearing, but not neglectful), strike up fun conversations, and are always in a positive mood. Even on a recent trip there when one of my party members was getting sick in the corner, the manager was constantly checking in to make sure this person was okay while also politely asking us to bring her outside. We never felt like we were being scolded or ordered out of the place -- which was really kind considering the circumstances! They handled things professionally and still managed to show that they cared about this person's wellbeing.   I think anyone visiting Madison should check this place out! Great for late-night food and drinks! Plenty of seating and they can accommodate groups."}
{"text":"A Madison staple. There is almost always a wait but it is worth it. I've had many items on the menu and I have never been disappointed. The only cocktail I've had here is their old fashioned and they're the best in town. They also have old fashioned kits for sale which would be a great Christmas gift for someone who moved away."}
{"text":"Went here twice this weekend. For the most part, we enjoyed it. The food was good and the beers were very good. Nice salad choices.    The disappointment both times was the extra orders of fried cheese curds. They were incredibly greasy both times. Oddly, as a side on a lunch plate they were much better. These were our highly anticipated first fried cheese curds."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great atmosphere, great service!  What more can you say?  Packed with locals and tourists, I could tell this would be a great dinner and I wasn't disappointed.  Try the burger with an egg and onion straws.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"4 stars just for the cheese curds.  My food has always been good here, but the cheese curds are extremely unique and better than any other curd out there.  The breading is different - lighter than most - and the dipping sauces are very tasty.  I have been tempted to visit Madison from Milwaukee just to get some of these curds."}
{"text":"Their fried fish is always a win. When coming to town, we always drive a little faster to get there for this. Their cocktail list is pretty impressive, too. These things alone almost makes the two plus hour wait tolerable.   That said, Franklin Delano was their cheese curds awful. The breading was completely soaked with grease. It's like they dumped the fryer oiler into our basket. The curds were a melted mess of cheese and doughy breading and fryer grease. Not appealing, sorry. You're literally in the middle of Wisconsin, how do you screw up Cheese Curds? It made me wish Buffalo Wild Wings could teach you how to cook according to their low standards.   Pro tip to wait staff that wants 20 percent. If your table orders something and stops eating it after a couple of bites, perhaps you should ask of everything is alright. But you'd have to actually walk past your tables every now and again to know that. So, I understand. You were probably too busy to do your job."}
{"text":"Started with cheese curds - best in the State - then fried plaice - really good - washed down with a furthermore all at really great prices."}
{"text":"Okay, let's start with the good:  Bf and I were in town and we decided to stop in based upon many Yelp and other reviews.  On a Saturday night at 7:00 pm, there was around a 30-45 minute wait, but they had pagers, so we grabbed one and went to the bar.  The beer selection was expansive, but I felt like something sweeter so I got a white Russian. The restaurant was crowded and lively, and the bf definitely appreciated the Duke game playing on the TV.  So... four stars for the bar area.  Now onto the bad:  actual dinner.  Okay, so I wasn't expecting Michelin-starred food, but SANDWICHES?  Seriously.  So the bf got a turkey sandwich and I got the beer-battered walleye.  Nothing much to say about those besides the fact that they must love their mayo in Wisconsin.  We also got cheese curds to share.  I've never had cheese curds before, but I'm pretty sure that they could have called them \"TGI Friday's mozzarella stick nuggets\" and it would been a good description.    Back to the good:  $35 bill.  Okay... I can stomach that (even though I can't, literally, since the cheese curds kind of took up 50% of my belly)."}
{"text":"First time in Madtown and was brought here by a local. Close to the capital and a great view. Love the interior, it's \"old fashioned\" sorry, could not help myself. Love the feel and the friendly staff. I did not try it, but was told they do make a good one and live up to their name sake.  I had Wisconsin Beer Cheese soup, they garnish with popcorn which I thought was hilarious, but actually very tasty.  They only offer BLT when heirloom tomatoes are in season and the it's so big it is basically two sandwiches :)"}
{"text":"i like food that is not meal food but not appetizer food... cheese plates, meat trays, etc. this is a great inexpensive way to eat food like you'd eat it out of your fridge. a little of this, a little of that. only its probably better than what you'd find in your fridge (and i keep good food in mine). beers were interesting. i liked the IPA. sitting in the window looking out at the capitol wasn't too shabby either. (please note: i was doing the tourist thing and i think this is probably a great tourist spot)"}
{"text":"You know it's gotta have something going for it when there's a wait at 5:30pm.  Great vibe.  Pretty loud (it is a bar), but we came with some little people, so that made it a little hard.   The food is awesome.  A little greasy, but really really good.  Cheese curds, burgers, Walleye fish sandwich, and the ribs were all eaten fully at our table.    And plenty of microbrews to enjoy as well.    Definitely one of my favorite places in Madison..... just wish no one else knew about it!"}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned seems to be a Madisonian staple and yesterday was the second time I've been there.  I kept waiting to be blown away but it didn't seem to pan out.  We arrived around 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon and were surprised at how busy it was.  The host seated us at a table near the front windows.  After sitting in blinding sunshine and swatting flies for five minutes (apparently the blinds were broken) we asked our waitress to seat us somewhere else.  She turned around and left and we sat there wondering what to do.  Then she motioned us from across the room to follow her.  So the three of us picked up our water glasses, menus, silverware and napkins (the waitress really should have accommodated a bit more) and reseated us.  A new waiter greeted us and dropped off an order of cheese curds before running to another table.  We all looked at each other... free cheese curds?  Well, no.  It turned out the waiter confused our table # with another so the other table got their (now cold) cheese curds.  We ordered a cheese plate.  They were out of the Camembert... the one cheese we were all dying to try.    I mean, seriously.  Seriously?    We sub'd a blue cheese on the cheese plate and two out of the three cheeses were great.  The wine selection was not great but they carry Cupcake wines, which I love and have a hard time finding commercially.  The cheese curds we eventually did order were hot and greasy and chewy, so we knew they were fresh.  The tossed green salad I ordered was enormous and unimpressive... like they had dumped a bag of lettuce onto a plate.  The best part of our early dinner?  The prostitute and her john sitting at the bar in front of us.  It was a lot like dinner theater, only much more uncomfortable.  Bottom line:  Solid three star dining which makes me sad since it could be a wonderful five star kind of a place with a few tweaks."}
{"text":"So many options.  Everything is great.   Best curds in town.  I love the vibe of this place.  Usually quite lively, but on the rare occasions it's quiet, it's cozy and welcoming."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned has EXCELLENT food!  My favorite is the pulled pork sandwich and the cheese curds!!!  I have tried a lot of things on the menu and have never been disappointed!!!!    A little loud so I wouldn't recommend it for deep conversations but it is always a good crowd and fun place to be.   They have excellent Mimosa specials on the weekend!!!"}
{"text":"I will concur, they do not take reservations.  And that is annoying, especially with the crowds they draw.  But, if you want to have the best cheese curds, EVER, you will need to fight the crowds to get a table (or seat at the bar) here.  They have some very interesting menu items, but they also have some really yummy salads if you are not in the mood for the other stuff.  I have consistently gotten the portabella sandwich and the walleye, but I will be honest, it is the cheese curds that bring me back."}
{"text":"Decent food n' shit. Apparently a great place for mom's with kids for lunch and hipsters without responsibilities at age 30 for 6pm-on"}
{"text":"This place used to have really good food.  Post expansion, I feel like it's gotten a little greasier and less fresh tasting.  And perhaps the service has gotten a little worse.  Still a great place to hang out and have an indulgent meal with a good beer.  Or a fun stop for a late night snack while out on the town."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint! We have been to this place during both of the trips up here to Madison. The food is AMAZING! The prices are VERY reasonable, especially for the quality and amount of food you get. The service is great! In my opinion, I could eat at this place every day for an entire month and not get tired of it. They have a ton of options for meals. I strongly recommend either the Walleye sandwich or the Tilapia tacos for your main dish. YOU HAVE TO TRY THE CHEESE CURDS!!!!! These are hands down the best cheese curds I have ever had. Not to mention the super tasty dipping sauces. If you are a root beer lover like I am, you have to get their root beer on tap. It is super yummy and you will want more than just one glass. For the adults our there, they have a huge adult beverage menu. This place isn't call The Old Fashioned for no reason. I tried the Orange Rum Old Fashioned because I love almost anything orange flavored. I will say that they do not skimp on the alcohol. It was very tasty! We have received amazing service both visits. The staff are super friendly and helpful with the menu. They do a great job with answering any questions that you may have regarding the menu. They make sure your drinks are always full. I only wish they had a place like this back in Indianapolis. The only downfall I would say is that it can be pretty loud at times. Also, it can be a tight squeeze because they are always so busy. If you are visiting Madison, WI, I would say this place is a MUST TRY! I don't think you will be disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"A real Wisconsin classic. This is where I like to take anyone who is visiting me from out of town.  They do not take reservations, so if you go after 5 pm on a weekend, be prepared for a 45 minuet wait.  Things you must order: Cheese curds- I like them with the Smoked paprika dip (fried cheese dipped in mayonnaise= amazing) Cheese plate- any will do, they are really fun for a big group The Old Fashioned House Burger- It has bacon and an egg on it! Win! Wisconsin Benedict- if you find yourself here for brunch this is a must, especially if you are a mustard and bratwurst fan. The mustard hollandaise is magical!  I've been here numerous times and have liked everything I've tried. It's all pretty classic fare, not too adventurous, but good quality."}
{"text":"safe menu with a lot of variety.  can get very busy during dinner hours.  great beer selection and tasty appetizers"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service! They are fantastic! Best restaurant in Madison!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch once and won't be back. First, they gave us a table, and as the minutes ticked by we waited around for a server who never came. When we asked what was up, we were told you have to get up from your table, stand in line and wait your turn to order like at McDonalds. Thanks for telling us! So that's why all those people are standing around in this cramped space like veal. I don't care how good the food is, I'm a grownup and I don't want to eat in cafeterias anymore.  I understand how it helps them turn tables faster/push through the lunch rush and make a bunch of money, but it's just too uncomfortable. I don't just go to restaurants to eat, I go there to relax a little, too. You won't get that at the Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"Great selection of local brews and cheese.   Lively & casual atmosphere.  Don't forget fried cheese curds to accompany your tasty and high calorie meal."}
{"text":"Ok, i've only been here once, but i loved it! Can't wait to go back. I'll up date my review then...  Update: been back a couple times. It's still good. Service, atmosphere, and location are all great. The menu is huge and pretty good. It's a tribute to supper clubs, but i don't really get the supper club feel so much. Get the deep-fried cheese curds, they are the best in town!!"}
{"text":"This is your best bet for dinner in Madison. The food is great, the drinks are great, the service is great. The Old Fashioned, named after Wisconsin's favorite cocktail, is centrally located (it's on the Capital Square), and serves classic Wisconsin comfort food at very reasonable prices. I have dined here many, many times. It is ideal for dates, dinners with friends, business dinners, or a low-key solo lunch. Ideally, I go to The Old Fashioned on Saturday nights for their prime rib special, which (at the time of this writing) consists of a fantastic wedge salad, a generous portion of steak, a baked potato, a huge thing of fried onion strings and \"tiger sauce,\" i.e. horseradish sauce. I get the version with the 8 oz steak (which is somehow always huge anyway) and the whole dinner only costs $19.99. It's an incredible value. Other highlights of The Old Fashioned include great burgers, a huge beer list including hundreds of Wisconsin beers, \"lazy susans\" to share amongst your table that feature both liver sausage and deviled eggs, and sundaes with booze in them."}
{"text":"The walleye sandwich is delicious! They also have amazing cheese curds and Mac and cheese. The drinks and beer selection are also good. It can get pretty busy so id plan on going earlier and I'd leave your name and go walk around."}
{"text":"Wisconsin cuisine du terroir at its finest. Anyone who grew up with a grandmother who made sandwiches that consisted of a dense wagon wheel of summer sausage between two slices of bread can now lunch on The Old Fashioned's amazing No. 38, in which red onions, mustard and meunster cheese lovingly complement the shaved summer sausage folds cuddled between country bread slices. And it's toasted! (I admit I get weak in the knees for toasted sandwiches.) In fact, most the sandwiches are divine, and I've also heard great things about the lazy susan dishes. The decor is old-world Wisconsin but more in a I-bought-this-on-ebay way than found-in-my-grandpa's-garage. Still, it's pretty cool to revisit the beer signs and woodiness of some of the taverns of my childhood, even if I am paying $8 for a summer sausage sandwich. Skip the evening scene and pedal your ass up there for lunch to gawk at the pols and oldies while enjoying your No. 38. The place can get pretty packed, though (even at lunchtime) so get there early, and come hungry!"}
{"text":"You CAN NOT ago wrong with the cheese curds and the spicy burger! That's what the waitress recommended so I went for it and I was pleasantly surprised at how incredible both were! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was exactly what we were looking for! We were in town on vacation and had searched for best cheese curds! They did not disappoint! My boyfriend raved for days and told everybody he could. We also had the pork sandwich and cheese burger. Equally delicious! The service was phenomenal! We asked for drink suggestions and the waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive menu. The food came quickly and the portion sizes were fantastic for the price.  I will find my way back to Madison if only to come back to this restaurant! Yum is an understatement!  Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Really cool view of the capitol building but the only thing that wowed were the cheese curds."}
{"text":"I love old fashioned for their cheese curds and list of beers on tap. Those two things they do an amazing job at! And if I have guests in town I will take them here for those two things. But their food has always been a little mediocre in my opinion.  They do flights of their beer on tap which I enjoy to try new beers. They usually want you to pick a flight from the same line of taps. (Half of them are at one bar and the half at another) I believe they are color coded on the tap list.  I got their lake perch fish fry Wednesday special. The fish tasted fresh...I'm assuming it's not from lake monona. The fish came out a little cold. The French fries were good though. I've also gotten a brat there which again nothing amazing comes to mind about it."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. All of my friends from out of state have heard about this place and want to try it when they visit. Everyone that I've taken here has fallen in love with it. The food is beyond incredible, the drinks are delicious, and the atmosphere is awesome! I definitely suggest trying the place out!"}
{"text":"Love the cheese curds at this place. not only that but I have excellent serve and right away seating everytime I have gone. I'll admit I'm not a fan of the extra charges when you want a side of ranch dressing but overall I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Old Fashioned almost weekly for the last two years or so. The combination of Double Bubble (2-for-1 taps & rails) and karaoke is a lethal one - Wednesday is the new Friday.   Great service, amazing food (No. 33 is my standby, and the cheese curds are generally regarded as the best in town), and an inviting, cozy atmosphere.   The only downside is they're often packed (even with the new expansion), but you can always enjoy the unofficial state drink and namesake while you wait."}
{"text":"Prices are fair, food is wonderful.  I love this place."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a Capital Square hotspot. In fact, it's pretty difficult to get a table in a reasonable amount of time during regular dining hours. Alas - we arrived about 10pm and got a 2-top right away.   The Up-North Old Fashioned is a classic made with Kessler's. Just order one and don't worry about it. If you are a brandy person, not to worry you can be accommodated.   We spilt the Mac and Cheese with Bacon. This is very cheesy and rich dish - but works well as something to share. Companion had the chicken sandwich, which came with bacon and cheese. I had the Friday night perch special. This was really pretty good. The batter was nice and crispy with a nice crunch. The fish itself was very mild with good flavor.   I think the fish specials or the fish sandwich in general are good choices. The Old Fashioned burger is also good with bacon, cheese and a fried egg - but be careful this menu item is prone to be over cooked. When ordered medium rare it's tasty unless it comes out well done. This has happened to me enough times that I just won't order burgers of any kind at this restaurant.   The beer list is so big as to be obnoxious and overwhelming. If it's summer and they have the frozen brandy slush - just order one.   I'd give this place 4-stars but the service can be iffy... If not sort of off putting - accommodations are rarely made for the customer, it is the way it is and if you prefer something else, this place isn't for you. This said the Old Fashioned is open late and serves late. A big bonus from my perspective. It's a local joint - of you follow my posts you know I'm passionate about eating locally - Just do it."}
{"text":"Down to Earth excellent Food and a great selection of locally brewed beers on tap! Tables at the window offer a good view at the capitol as an added plus."}
{"text":"Yes it is very crowded ad loud but the food and beer are worth it.  The cheese curds are probably the best in town with this amazing tiger sauce. Try them with a #38, which is a summer sausage sandwich, and a pint of the house brew."}
{"text":"Cheese curds, tacos, and the secret service... That was what I experienced at The Old Fashioned as Tim Kaine vice presidential nominee stopped by to have an old fashion cocktail, burger and a little campaigning.   The place is trendy, food was good.  Cons- they don't take reservations, and the ice cream tasted a little freezer burned.  Pros-fish tacos, cheese curds and the root beer and cocktails were all tasty.  And it was kind of exciting to turn around and see the secret service and potential vp."}
{"text":"My family and I took a weekend trip to Madison from Chicago.  It also happened to be a Saturday when the Badgers were playing basketball and hockey games.  After spending the day at the basketball game and walking around Madison we were ready for a nice dinner.  We waited about an hour for a table of 6.  We arrived around 6 so waited until 7.  The one annoying thing is that you can't put your name in and walk away so we waited outside for a bit.  When we were seated we ordered our food.  We got the cheese curds with the different dipping sauces for an appetizer.  They were amazing!  I got the Mac and Cheese...I mean when in Wisconsin.  It was decent, but I've had better.  One of the highlights of our trip to The Old Fashioned besides the location and atmosphere was the draft root beer.  I'm sure I'll visit again the next time I visit Madison, hopefully over the summer when it's warm."}
{"text":"This place far exceeded expectations. Got the fried cheese curds which alone earned the 5 star rating. The cheese spread was awesome, needed a cracker refill. Burgers were awesome. Side salads were the only let down as the were just plain mixed greens. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"BEST FRIED CHEESE CURDS. I mean, you can only (or should only) eat a couple little nuggets at a time, so you might as well go for the gold.  The Mac n' Cheese was yummy, too, but not particularly special or distinctive."}
{"text":"This place was packed with no sitting at the bar and a typical  vague wait time for a table. Managed to find a bar stool after 20 min and ordered food.  Based on yelp reviews, I ordered the infamous cheese curds. You get to chose between several dipping sauces for the curds. I dont see what is so enticing about this \"specialty.\" Yeah they were fresh and straight out of the fryer as noted by the glistening basket. But the taste was....tofu-ish? = no flavor. Pretty much it was a waste of calories. Their salad was a complete contrast to the appetizer. Super fresh greens with beautiful pared add ons. The grilled fish was perfectly cooked and seasoned.   The bar tender customer service was superb. That poor guy amazingly and effectively managed that entire packed bar. Kudos!  I would probably come back to try more dishes/salads. Just avoid the empty calories (i.e. cheese curds)."}
{"text":"Being that this restaurant is so close to work and I've repeatedly heard glowing reviews on their food, I've given them three tries. Thus, I've had three disappointing experiences.  My first time there, the food was okay. The service was okay. Just okay. The atmosphere is kind of weird. Everyone orders from the bar (which can bottleneck things) and it's so loud it's sometimes hard to accomplish that feat. The seating is crowded and uncomfortable. The place is dim and dreary.   Admittedly, my second trip was with a larger group (7 people) during lunch rush. I don't expect the fastest of service under these conditions, but not getting our food for an hour and a half was a little extreme. The food was cold but tasted well enough. Nothing mind blowing. My sandwich was haphazardly thrown on a plate and I had to put it together myself when my server brought it out. Other members of my party had food that was inedible. Charred beyond recognition or raw.    My final trip, I showed up a little before 11:00 am. Thankfully, it was not busy yet because it took over an hour to get my salad... Which was greasy. I can't even ponder how you go about making a salad greasy. We had waited so long to get our food yet again, I just left without asking for the situation to be fixed.   So I guess if you drink beer, go have a blast trying to talk to your friends by screaming at the top of your lungs. If you want lunch? Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Man I love this place. The food is magnificent. My husband and I love their burgers. I like the bacon burger and my husband get a friend egg burger. Not sure the exact name. I order the cheese curds and my husband gets the homemade chips. Both of which come with a dipping sauce. We have tried ranch, BBQ and garlic. The service is great. The food is priced very well. It's a great experience."}
{"text":"The best food of its kind that I have experienced. I had the chicken-fried steak, which is pretty much perfect. I have no idea what could be done to improve it. My wife had the walleye sandwich. Best walleye either of us have had. Beats what I have had in the Minneapolis area, which is saying something. Cheese curds are as good or better than any I've had elsewhere.  Gazillion Wisconsin craft beers available, at prices that blew this Chicago resident's mind away. Three dollars and fifty cents for a Central Waters Peruvian Morning, a beer that costs at least $8 in Chicago? Yes, please, thank you.  Service is very friendly and informative. Yes, potentially long waits, but so it goes.  Outstanding, would go all the time were I a Madison resident. If you're looking for good old-fashioned Wisconsin/upper Midwest food, this is the spot."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for dinner with my coworker. One word, amazing! Our waitress, Rebecca, was so friendly and was able to offer great suggestions from the menu. The atmosphere was pretty chill. We ordered the No.7 Lazy Susan for an appetizer which literally could have been a meal split between us all by itself! It was so huge and tasty. For dinner, I ordered the eggplant sandwich (No.35?) which was good also, but the appetizer was definitely the highlight of the meal. I would definitely return here if I was in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison for the first time and my husband and I heard this place was a Madison staple.   We were not disappointed. Food was great, server was really nice, and the beer selection was great. If you're in Madison check it out!"}
{"text":"Super crowded and busy that we had to leave our cell phone number for call back.  The waitress said it would be 40 minutes so we walked around the Capitol square for the farmer's market. It was the perfect way to kill time and also enjoy some of the things around town.  I got some honey from local vendor as well as some bath soap gifts for my sister.  Anyways, the Old Fashioned has an interesting interior from the old days of Miller Lite, Schelz's, etc.  I had the No. 20 Cherry Salad and my wife had the No. 19 Spinach Salad with eggs.  I thought it was done pretty good and price was reasonable.  It was just the wait but we were in no rush to get to Milwaukee/Racine for Memorial day weekend."}
{"text":"After much hype and anticipation, I was excited to check this restaurant out. Our party of five only waited a short time to be seated, but unfortunately it was so noisy we just sat and stared at each other once we got to our table. The menu was disappointing as the food choices were limited. All five of us ordered some sort of fish. The perch fillets were the smallest I've ever seen, had an odor, and were slimy. The childs salmon was fishy smelling and obviously not fresh. The fried cod was burned and when my husband brought it to the waiter's attention we were given a lecture about why the color of the fish was so dark and they insisted the fish was cooked properly, completely disregarding our complaints about the burnt taste. The manager even came over and gave us the same speech and said he would comp us a dessert which itself was boring and bland. Anything fried it tasted like it had been fried in a weeks old grease and in the same grease the fish was cooked. Apparently, they have a great selection of beer, but that's the only highlight. I will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"How can you not love a place named The Old Fashioned?  Our visit visit started with a short wait for dinner, but we quickly found some seats at the bar.  The bartender was amazing and he kept us entertained while we waited for our table.  He caught cherries behind his back, let us sample some drinks, and was all around amazing.  You must try the Old Fashioned and even try a new one, too.  You won't regret it!  Once we were seated at our table, we enjoyed some delicious cheese curds as an appetizer, and some Old Fashioneds.  We enjoyed our meal so much.  The restaurant is loud inside, which is the only downside."}
{"text":"Man I have to say that the burger is really good, but later found out that almost all of the beef in the Midwest is really good compared to California. That being said, the fried cheese curds are totally disgusting.  I don't know who established that cheese curds are a \"wisconsiner thing\", but if you like a damn salt bomb in your mouth, then by all means. Let's see here: cheese curds themselves are salty, then you bread and salt them again, and finally deep fry them in fats. This should be illegal, and ruined my meal :("}
{"text":"I usually choose this restaurant when people are visiting from out of town.   Then we go look at the capital building or stroll down State St. Great food, and the service has always been professional."}
{"text":"The burgers are the bomb.   I felt like eating my burger with a bun was a misdemeanor, and adding any condiments would be a serious felony. Really, the burgers are so amazing.   We also ordered onion strings and cheese curds, which were good...but I will be thinking about that burger for a long time."}
{"text":"I'm from California and this was the first place my supervisor had me try! She would continuously rave about it so I did. My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night and it was jammed pack but we sat at the bar. The bartender was super friendly allowing for us to try different Wisconsin beers since it was our first time in WI. Spotted Cow was hands down the favorite! We came for one thing is specific- the cheese curds! So bomb especially with the dipping sauce! My boyfriend ordered the spicy burger and I ordered mac and cheese. He loved his burger! I thought the mac and cheese was mediocre. Overall, neat place!! Definitely try the cheese curds!!"}
{"text":"This place was close by to where we were staying while in town for the Ironman and had great reviews so we decided to check it out.  It was a little busy so we couldn't get a table immediately, but they have a great system for waiting where they will text you when your table is ready.  No waiting close by with that stupid vibrator, red light clunky thing.  We were free to explore more of the area while we waited.   The beer menu is vast and they have a good choice for a sampling tray.  Since I was doing the big ole Ironman the next day I limited myself to one beer.  Then I proceeded to carb up with the mac'n'cheese. You can't beat a good Wisconsin cheddar and this stuff was awesome.  I also tried some of the chips and everything was delicious. This place was packed but our server did a good job of keeping up with the rush."}
{"text":"They always say it's going to be a long wait and it never is. Great service every time. Get the cheese curds!. Priced well."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison, hands down! It's a good place to go with a big group. I take everyone who visits Madison here. I think the cheese curds here are the best in Madison. They also have really good cheese plates. I generally order the chilli, which can be hit or miss depending on who makes it (generally it's pretty chunky, but sometimes it can taste watered down with too much tomato sauce). On Wednesday nights, they also have karaoke, which just adds to the experience. On weekends, there can be a pretty long wait to get seats."}
{"text":"The in-taker was abit chippy, making us wait until the whole group of 4 arrived, even though 3 of us were there... but once you get past this nonsense the food and drinks were fine... I was really disappointed they didn't have cherry juice to make the door county old fashioned. But the regular one was an okay consolation prize."}
{"text":"This seems to be a popular place in the Madison downtown area with plenty of seating (at least on the weekdays). They have a large menu with something for everyone. Of course you will need to order some cheese curds as an appetizer.   The food and service was good --- with a short wait time (even when they are busy)."}
{"text":"A huge beer selection ( more than 100), and all local. That alone makes this place fantastic and worth a visit.   Awesome atmosphere. A great post-work stop off. Or a perfect place to get drunk with your friends while experimenting with weird Wisconsin brews or delicious flights. Ok I should probably stop talking about the beer.  The food is great, very Wisconsin (read: terrible for your health but amazing for your appetite). AND THE CHEESE CURDS ARE AMAZING. Seriously, best in town."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a great little place that some local friends told me about.  We were up for a business convention and this place had a one hour wait for a dining table at 7pm.  We sat/stood at the bar until we could get a table.    The menu is full of a great variety of dishes.  You have to try the deep fried cheese curds if you are here.  The bar has a lot of local beers on tap so there's something for everyone.  One of the two porters they had was absolutely incredible.    Prices are good and our group wanted to come back two days in a row, so get there early and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Visiting from New England and never had fried cheese curds or Grandma's slush (brandy lemonade slush).  Oh my god!   It's a good thing I don't live here.  It was awesome!  A must if you've never tried them!"}
{"text":"Wisconsin eggs Benedict. I dream of this dish. I only wish they had it on every menu, not just brunch."}
{"text":"Having heard such rave reviews of TOF over the years, we brought some friends from out of town here for dinner, hoping this place would deliver the quintessential Wisconsin dining experience that we've heard so much about. We didn't wait long for a seat, and service was prompt. They offer a wide-range of WI of beers, and they make a decent old-fashioned cocktail. The fish and the burgers were good, but the cheese curds were a disappointment, being a bit too greasy. TOF overlooks the Capitol, and it's beautifully decorated. It can get very crowded and loud."}
{"text":"Solid contemporary take on the classic Wisconsin establishment.  Service is always fantastic. Great specials. Make your own old fashioned's are fun."}
{"text":"Having brunch at the Old Fashioned is one of my favorite things to do on the weekends. There's rarely a wait, the bloody mary's are fantastic, and the food is delicious. I have never left disappointed, and I always look forward to the next time I go. This is also my parents' favorite place to go when they come visit. The dinners are great as well, but the long wait can be annoying."}
{"text":"Everything people say is true. Fresh fried cheese curds, a delectable lazy susan platter (cheese spread! pickled beets and green beans! Wisconsin red potato salad!),  more cheese curds, friendly service and 2-for-1 drink speclals in the afternoon.   It was so, so good to be home."}
{"text":"Idk, but I feel this place is more hype than legit. Curds were avg as was the burger I had. Not bad but not great. Idk if it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Just gross. Finding screws (the kind used to hammer)in your burger is not a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"Top highlights/lowlights  1) gluten free friendly 2) Wisconsin style restaurant bar is a must for visitors from out of town 3) friendly service  If you live in Madison or are just visiting the Old Fashioned is a must! The Wisconsin supper club feel paired with Wisco food, beers and drinks creates the perfect place for breakfast, lunch, dinner or drinks.  We just had brunch at Old Fashioned on a Sunday and while I have had to wait up to 40mins in the past, (Old Fashioned does not take reservations) we did not have to wait at all today. Outside seating is available but we ate inside.   The breakfast menu includes dishes like chicken fried steak, ham and eggs, daily scramblers (veggie and meat with eggs that changes based on the day), and yogurt with granola and Door County cherries - YUM! There are a variety of side dishes including pickled eggs and bratwurst. There is also a variety of specialty breakfast cocktails available as well as the full bar. Gluten free toast is available for an additional charge.  We all tried something different but agreed that the food and service was great. Great food, great drinks and a great atmosphere make this a 5 star Madison stop!"}
{"text":"Yeah just not feelin' the love here.  The Old Fashioned is a crowded, pretty noisy pub with a dizzying array of local beers on tap.  Burger was good but nothing special.  Definately a good watering hole if you want to engage in Wisconsin's state sport, beer drinking."}
{"text":"From the minute you walk in the door...this place has a great BBQ hickory smell.  It also feels like home.  Many people complain about the crowd.  I seem to always come in here by myself and always find one lonely spot at the bar.  The bar also has a ton of beers too...in fact 150 Wisconsin beers in the house...which makes for a long beer picking process.  Personally I trust them and go for the beer of the month, which is only 2.50 for a pint...nice...June 2011 is the Fatty Boombalatty beer of the month.  Not only is it good but it is fun to say when you order it!!!  I also had the Sheboygan's Grand Champion Miesfeld Market Double Bratwurst with raw onion , pickles and brown mustard in a buttered Highway Bakery hard roll.  $7.95 or as it is listed in the menu the No.32.  The brats are amazing...so good!!!  I was not happy with the hard roll...it seemed like the thing that was wrong with the sandwich.  Maybe a soft roll like they serve in Sheboygan would be better?  Just maybe.  There are also great bar eats too...I tried the spicy pickled egg for a buck...it was okay. I've had a better one in a small bar north of Sheboygan years ago. I need to find that place again!!!  Always a lively spot.  Also at 10:30 on Tuesday night happy hour started as I was getting my bill...I was totally tempted but could not see myself drinking anymore beer...2 for 1 pints...great deal but I needed to go to sleep for a busy day at work...maybe next time!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good gastropub. They have a good beer selection and great heart inducing food. It's busy, even on a Tuesday night. I tried fried cheese curds here for the first time in my life and it was delicious. My burger was cooked just right and the mac and cheese noodles were cooked al dente. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful.   Definitely a very Wisconsin-y bar to visit."}
{"text":"The food is always pretty good here and the staff is always really attentive.  I still have yet to try an old fashioned though so I can't give it 5 stars yet."}
{"text":"Having lived in Madison for over 4 years now, I'm honestly surprised that The Old Fashioned gets so many good reviews. I'm not sure if it's mostly tourists who are influenced by the hype that this place has the \"best curds in Madison\", but it's simply not the case, in my opinion.   Their curds are inconsistent, and sometimes they are totally soggy and oily. The rest of the menu isn't too exciting, and the dishes tend to be bland and one-dimensional. I once had a salmon salad and it was decent, but not in any way memorable or well-executed. Ironically, I also found their Old Fashioned (cocktail) to be undrinkable.   There are SO MANY other places with much better curds, and this place is just overhyped and not worth the wait. Especially when you are on the Square, I can think of a couple other places within walking distance that have curds and dinner dishes that are 10x better. Don't get me wrong, The Old Fashioned is a historic and charming joint,  so stop in, take a look, and grab a beer, but I don't recommend staying for the food."}
{"text":"The different sets of parents at our table agreed that The Old Fashioned has the best cheese curds. Our 14-year-old son says that this is his favorite place for bacon cheeseburgers. The have their own root beer, enjoyed by all. Always packed."}
{"text":"Great comfort food and the best bloody mary's in town in my opinion."}
{"text":"Get the brat plate.  And the cheese curds.  Its crowded!  Leave plenty of time for a standing room only wait."}
{"text":"I went with some Friends from Appleton There was a line out the Door we went in and got a table right away so that was cool Service was ok for how busy they were.   We had 2 appetizer's Potato Chips they were very Good.  Cheese Curds they were Good.  Brian had the #30 Burger he said it was Good,  Sue had the Grilled Cheese and they used so much Butter her hand was greasy,  I had the #33 i think it was a turkey sandwich with lettuce and pickles the bread too had so much butter my hand was greasy,   Both Her and I Could not finish our Sandwich's because of all the greasy Butter it started to make me not feel good.  I figured mine would be good and Healthy as I need low Cholesterol and Salt Foods  Seeing how I did have the Potato Chips. It Was NOT worth the $47.00 we had to pay! Would I go back I doubt it!"}
{"text":"I like taking out of towners who aren't necessarily \"adventurous\" in the eating department. This is good food done right. The onion strings are phenomenal."}
{"text":"The day I moved to Madison I asked three different people that I saw walking around where I should eat and unanimously I received the Old Fashioned as the destination of choice. What I wasn't warned of was that no matter when you go there you're going to end up with over an hour wait, even for just two people. And something that shouldn't come as a shock to anyone trying to eat out in Madison, they don't take reservations. So if you want to eat here you're going to have to suck it up and wait. Luckily for me the few times that I've gone, there have been concerts on the square so I was able to put down my name and they will text you when your table is ready. So the waiting is inevitable, but this is also a classic Madison destination if that is what you're looking for.   In terms of the ambiance of the restaurant, all of the tables/chairs/bars have a dark wood finish that get natural light from the front wall of windows during the day or become dimly lit by candles during the evening. No matter what the time of day, the restaurant is always bustling with people and has an exciting atmosphere. Every waiter/waitress that I have had here was perfectly cordial and social, with more than enough recommendations if you can't decide what you want.   Everyone will recommend this place for its cheese curds, the Classic Wisconsin dish, and they most certainly do not disappoint. Every bite is just a cheesy and fried as the last. So getting them as an appetizer or as a side for your meal is a must. The actual entree/sandwich dishes I wasn't as impressed with. They have some strange combinations of foods that weren't really to my liking, but maybe that's just me. I'm sure others have had more luck than me in their choices (it is always packed so they must be doing something right in this department), but most of my meals here have come up a bit short in the quality factor. On the order hand, the drink options have never disappointed. They have numerous beers on tap or in bottles that are found locally if that's what you want. I am more of a cocktail person and if you fall under that category too then you should most certainly get one of the many old fashioneds that they have. They all have a great combination of fresh fruit and/or spices that you will definitely enjoy. So on the drinks side of things I say A+, but the food was more of an A- or B+ in my opinion.   For the record I have not been for brunch yet (I've never been willing to wait that long for brunch) but the menu looks awesome and you should certainly give that a try if you can stand waiting."}
{"text":"Breakfast review.  I turned up there this morning and was really pleased with what was on offer. First, the bar was decorated with frightenly large (and scary yummy looking) apple fritters under traditional glass cake domes. Offered by the quarter (no you don't need to order a whole one) thats more than enough of that deep-fried-frosted-frittery-goodness.  Breakfast options were many and while deciding we were treated to some curiously strong coffee - just the way I like it.  Of all the organic-ish, local-ish ingredients it was hard to decide - but, I finally settled in on the scramble of the day with sage sausage, aged cheddar and sweet onions swimming with les ouefs. Brilliant.  Friendly staff, not crowded but, by the time we left it was filling up...."}
{"text":"for all of you bitching about the wait - they just opened the second half of the space! now the wait is tolerable, if there even is one."}
{"text":"Good food. Can be busy and hard to get into but that's a good thing right. The old fashioned burger is outstanding."}
{"text":"We were here for a late lunch today with some family from out of town. In general I enjoy the Old Fashioned, although it's often too long of a wait - no reservations! It's good, but not that good. For me it's a good place to bring visitors, or good to stop in if you're walking by and there happens to not really be a wait. For me, it's too crowded and too loud to make it a regular go to.   But...their food is really good. You'll absolutely not get a light lunch here, but you're going to love the cheese curds. Today I went with the Spicy Burger and fries. I sure liked it a lot, although the bun was not quite the right fit. It kept doing that annoying thing when it just slides off the burger every single time you try to pick it up. And then you make a huge mess. But it was delicious! And I love their Bloody Mary - for sure one of the better ones in Madison.   So I'm vacillating between 3 and 4 stars. While I was there I was leaning towards 3, but now I'm thinking 4. Despite the yummy food and drinks, it was loud, crowded, and the service was surprisingly lacking. But now I'm remembering the burger and going with 4 stars. So yes it was very busy in there today, but the service was lackluster. For example, it took forever (20+min) for a waitress to stop by our table (they all thought someone else was our server). We were brought the wrong food, and we had to ask for silverware after getting our meals.   I'm sure I'll be back at some point. The Old Fashioned is good, but a tad overrated."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I recommend the breakfast old fashioned with  orange juice. Yum!"}
{"text":"It's pretty average. I like that I can get a grass fed burger here for a good price. It's a little too dark in the evening, and always feels a little dirty."}
{"text":"Good service, basic WI/American food. You can get a great old fashioned here. Almost always a longer than desired wait to be seated.   This restaurant is located  on the square. It's a convenient pit stop after the famers's market  on the square (Saturdays)"}
{"text":"A victim of its own success. If this was any other restaurant, it would be great. The food is very good, though not remarkable, the portions are amazing, and the space is very nice.   Unfortunately, once you factor in the hour wait you wonder why in the world you waited an hour for a burger that's very good but not remarkable. The high demand for a table also leads to service that can be rushed and abrupt.   My final complaint concerns the veggie sandwich. If I'm ordering a veggie sandwich instead of a burger it's because I don't want 8 million calories. Hold back on the oil, please.   (Oh, I almost forgot to mention the cheese curds. They're good. Pretty much every cheese curd I've ever had has been pretty good. It's a fried cheese curd.)"}
{"text":"You know about the cheese curds yadda yadda yadda. Let me reiterate thevdeals and steals you *need* to be acting on:  Double bubble: two for one taps and rails Mon-Thurs 3-5 pm and 10:30-midnight. This means you can grab two of their famous old fashioneds or 2x any of the gazillion beers for around $5.  ALSO, they feature a Wisconsin beer of the month (we're talking nice ones, people) for $2.50 all day every day. In August it was Wisconsinite from Lakefront Brewery. Grrrreat deal."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars: Went in around 7:00 p.m. on a Wednesday night, and the place was packed -- was able to get a table for 6 after a 15 minute wait.  The place was a classic hometown American bar and grill (the sort that Applebee's aspires to become, but overcompensates for), and the menu was almost entirely hamburgers, with some salads, hot dogs, and cheese on the side.  It's a great place for families because there's a kids menu, and it's a good option for both vegetarians and ominivores/carnivores because there're certainly options for both.  Definitely not for a place for people with serious aversions to meat and above-average noise level at restaurants.  We had a cheese plate to start, which had some really great selections -- unfortunately forgot which plate it was, but it was the waitress' recommendation.  Also came with crackers, apple slices, and a bit of honey on the side, which made munching more fun.    I'd ordered #42, the roast beef tenderloin sandwich with a salad on the side.  The salad was very leaf-heavy without much of anything else, and I wasn't able to finish it.  The sandwich itself was good, nothing mind-blowing, I may've been slightly disappointed because I was ready to have my taste buds blown away by the \"tiger sauce\" and the \"shaved red onions\" that topped the sandwich, both of which sounded fun to a lifelong Easterner, and the texture of the beef made for very ungraceful consumption (think stringy).  If I were ever to go back (highly unlikely), I would order something else.    The best part of meal was the dessert -- apple pie a la mode.  The apple pie itself tasted very classic, but not as sweet as expected -- which was perfect, because the vanilla ice cream that was put on top balanced out the palette.  But it didn't stop there -- the restaurant included a cross-section of Wisconsin cheddar which really expanded the taste bud action, because it added a new sort of tangyness, creaminess, and saltiness to the entire plate.  The tiny plate packed a bit of food adventure for sure."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to eat!!  Delicious food and excellent service every time I've been there! And the cheese curds...nothing compares!  Will return as often as I can!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the Old Fashioned. It's a true staple of Downtown Madison. The cheesecurds are delicious (just wish the ranch dressing was thicker). And I've never had a bad, or even mediocre, meal. The new addition has really helped with wait times and seating, although I would recommend coming early if you're planning to be there on a busy night. They don't take reservations (bummer). Try the pickled egg in your beer - or the Old Fashioned Burger if you're feeling adventurous and hungry!"}
{"text":"Before you start throwing an assortment of stones and tomatoes at me, the cheese curds deserve 5 stars- hands down. They are amazing - there's no denying. Grease never tasted so good and well, anything with a good cheese involved typically wins my heart over.   It was a Friday night and this place was hopping. Eating can often serve as the entertainment of the evening for my friends and I, so The Old Fashioned was stop number two of three for our evening of grazing. \"Nothing in moderation\" is our group motto. Our game plan was drinks and rounds upon rounds of their infamous curds and dips like garlic and ranch. We weren't planning on hanging around too, too long because we'd heard the food beyond the curds was meh, meh.   As soon as we took our order of curds and booze, the waitress seemed ticked - like, that's it? I've been to Europe, I get the cupierto, fret not, you're going to get a fair and hefty tip - especially if you don't seem pissed at our simple order. In the end, the oozing and flavorful curds outweighed our a-okay service. This is probably more of a 3.5."}
{"text":"Chocolate chip cookies are the best here!!! Not served on Weekends though :(  Great food but service can be slow. We go here for breakfast every year before hitting the Taste of Madison, on Sunday. Good start to the day."}
{"text":"Welcoming staff! Isaac and Sam are excellent bartenders. Good food. Good company. Good old fashion \"Old Fashioneds\"."}
{"text":"From the atmosphere to the waiter, and of course the food, this place was perfect!  We had the Lazy Susan - literally they bring out a Lazy Susan with about 10 different homemade items on it: ours had pickled beets and peas, potato salad, deviled eggs, coleslaw, and a few wonderful cheese spreads and bread.  For the main course we had the Friday Fish Fry: Lake Perch, Walleye, and Cod. The food  comes fast and it is amazing!  We washed it down with a pitcher of Spotted Cow; one of 60 some beers on tap.  Our server Zach was attentive and did a fantastic job. The whole meal was $65 without tip - really not bad. The portion sizes are very large.  Many friends who have been here recommend the cheese curds as well. We will have to try these next time!"}
{"text":"We came to Madison last week for a couple days and we stopped in here for dinner one of those nights. Let me begin by saying our server was great, very prompt and super friendly. We started out with one of their MANY local brews, and an order of cheese curds. Coming from Minnesota, there is an intense rivalry with Wisconsin and our lovely home, so I don't admit this easily, but those cheese curds are THE best I've ever had! Not too greasy, and not overly breaded, delish! I ordered their special, the wiener schnitzel and my companion ordered the mac & cheese with a side of ring bologna. Neither of us could finish our meal, but only because the servings were so large. The schnitzel was enormous and just the right thickness so that it isn't just a piece of fried breading. It came with an awesome lemony flavored sauce, mashed red potatoes, red cabbage and apples. Devine! My companion said the mac and cheese was amazing, full of cheeses flavor. We both left full and if we're back in Madison we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The service can be slow. But the fact that pretty much all of the beers are $5 or less and they're all local makes up for the slow service. I had no idea there were so many local breweries in Wisconsin and I wanted to try them all! I had some great IPAs that I'll probably never find anywhere in Chicago. We also had the cheese curds and they are heart attack happiness! The pint of American IPA was delicious, probably my favorite pick of the night. And the bartendress was really helpful in my choice for the right IPA to try. I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"I called previous to coming in and was told there was no wait and I could walk right in. However, as soon as I walked in there was an hour wait. I understand this is downtown Madison but I would say warn your potential customers that it could be the case. My party went to wait at the bar and as I approached, a bartender greeted me and I asked him questions about the beer and he was not friendly and I ended up walking away from the bar out of frustration. After not ordering for awhile I was greeted by the bartender Kurt. THE BEST BARTENDER AND EMPLOYEE AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT. I was curious about the beers and he brought me samples of different kinds. Even after I ordered he brought me a couple more to figure out what I would get next. He's the only reason I stayed and the only reason this post got four stars."}
{"text":"AAAHHH!!!! I love this place! The food is absolutely delicious, not your typical bar food. You have to try the cheese curds with the tiger sauce!! The House Brew is amazing, walleye sandwich is delicious and you can get a hamburger with an egg on it!! Unfortunately you can't make reservations and seating is very limited which can make for some long waits sitting (or standing) by the bar waiting. But with some amazing libations (pretty good martinis!) the wait goes by pretty quickly. This place is one of my absolute favorite in Madison and I'd strongly recommend it to anyone who lives here or is visiting."}
{"text":"Cheese curds are excellent.  Crispy outside but stretchy and yummy inside.   Tried others but these were up there on list.  The salad was also excellent.  Large enough to share.  The fish sandwich was also very good.  This is a great stop in Downtown Madison."}
{"text":"In Madison WI, many people laud the restaurant options as something of a miracle.  For a medium sized town, it has a myriad of choices.  So when you venture into a place not far from where you live that has \"delivered the goods\" in the past, you assume that consistency will win the day.  On this occasion, I sat at the far end of the bar where I could bask in the glory of having a few empty seats on either side.  The bartender came quickly enough to take my beer order.  A few minutes later, I chose an old standby, their hot dog, which was made a little north in Sheboygan.  While the restaurant was doing a brisk business, I mistakenly assumed that a humble hot dog would be a relatively quick turnaround in the kitchen.  Alas, my hopes were dashed when I found myself minus a hot dog almost thirty minutes later.  In the time spent, other diners sat on either side of me and gave their respective orders, which came out within a ten minute window. Some thirty minutes later, said hot dog arrives, either ten minutes cooled or 15 seconds nuked.  Later, the bartender asks the diners on either side of me how everything was tasting, while ignoring my presence completely.  Since a direct confrontation in this situation generally does not lead to a fruitful outcome, I chose to leave a slightly lower than normal tip and disappear, like Casper the friendly ghost.  I'll remember this bartender's face, though he will likely forget mine, and that's fine."}
{"text":"I came here for a networking/informational dinner. We started with cheese curds because this was my first and only time in Wisconsin, and I heard that you can't visit without trying the cheese. We told the waitress to surprise us, so I don't know which ones she surprised us with, but they were decent. A girl in the group said that they were the best she has ever tried, but I don't really have a standard to compare this with so I have no clue.  I ordered the scandinavian style chicken dinner, which was a half chicken rubbed with cinnamon/cardamom/juniper, with mashed potatoes and stuffing on the side. Everything was decent but nothing about my meal stood out to me.  Lovely decorations"}
{"text":"Seriously, what's not to like about this place!?  Their menu is extensive, drinks are made perfect, their beer lineup is diverse, and their food is delicious and doesn't break the bank.  You're only cheating yourself if you haven't been here yet."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds in Madison--hands down. Love their selection of craft beers, local burgers and the overall feel of the place."}
{"text":"Great old time Wisconsin food.  Hearty portions and an excellent selection of Wisconsin beers.  The food is good, but the atmosphere really makes this place for me."}
{"text":"Wife and I wanted brats and so we each ordered the Wurst platter. It's listed as a party appetizer/starter but it definitely is great for the meal.   Brats were delicious. Came with two mustards, sauerkraut and bread and pickled green beans (never had them before but great and perfect for that meal).   I also had  a spinach salad with bacon dressing to start things off. That too was very good.   Atmosphere relaxed and comfortable and you can dress casual and feel totally at place. A little noisy but just fine. Prices really good for what you get and it being so close to the capitol.   If we come back to Madison near the capitol we will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Tried a Rueben from the Old Fashioned today...it was...o.k. Doesn't compare to the Rueben I had at Deli Roma made of Boar's Head corned beef, Swiss cheese and Turano bakery dark rye."}
{"text":"Nice location and decor. Cheese curds were nice and soft almost melting in your mouth. Service was a little slow going but not too bad. Menus are mismatched as my last page with drinks were different from my wife's. A few of the soft drinks we ordered were no longer available so they should've corrected all menus. The dinner entrees were few but there were plenty of sandwiches to choose from. My wife's Mac n Cheese with bacon wasn't very good. I ordered the Sunday special chicken dinner that came with mashed potatoes & gravy, a sausage dressing, carrots and Polenta that was pretty amazing. The reason for my low rating is the \"no weapons or firearms\" sign at the door. It absolutely amazes me that some don't realize that concealed carry has reduced violent crime by 50% since 1990s. Gun-free zones ask for trouble."}
{"text":"During a weekend trip to Madison last month, we were told we absolutely had to stop in at The Old Fashioned while we were there. We drove well out of our way to do so on a Sunday morning, but I can say that it was well worth the effort.  Despite it only being ten in the morning, and subsequently me feeling like an alcoholic, I had to try one of their many tap beer options. I chose a local brewery, one from just outside the city limits, but that which I cannot remember the name. At any rate, it perfectly complimented my omelet and home fries. I left there feeling very satisfied, wishing there was an Old Fashioned in the Twin Cities somewhere. C'est la vie,  I guess. Also, the decor was amazing, a wonderful collection of beer signs and cool vintage artwork/posters. Prices were reasonable, especially considering the part of town and the university being nearby."}
{"text":"The old fashioned is aptly named.  I was slightly upset that I went for lunch since I previously had my hopes on trying their old fashioned.  I got the meatloaf sandwich on texas toast and upgraded to fried cheese curds for a side.  I was thoroughly embarrassed that I could only eat about a third of the meal . . . . yeah its heavy stuff.  Lunch was an interesting format; order at the bar and pay right away.  Food came quick and people checked on us a few times.  Location: Great (literally next to the capitol and very accessible by about a million buses).  Feel: Old-world-wisco-pub with a touch of new world flair.  Staff: little interactions due to the lunch format, but everyone was nice.  Food: Portioning was super heavy and the meatloaf was basic.  Food was good for what it was, although I had hopes for something a little more thought out."}
{"text":"Super nice servers and hostesses...great assortment of beers and they even let me tastes a few before I choose one to order...had the burger with cheese curds and it was to die for...yum yum good...I wanted to lick the plate clean...LOL!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here last Friday and was impressed. They have a delicious selection of salads, and the prices of menu items are reasonable. They also have outdoor seating and friendly wait staff. I will return!"}
{"text":"The service was good just very loud.  Guess the food was good just hard to converse   But it is a bar and I would go again"}
{"text":"During my recent trip visiting friends in Wisconsin, we spent one of our days in Madison. The first place we went to was The Old Fashioned to have lunch. I liked the interior decor - bar restaurant feel and they had lanterns strung across the top of the bar. Not sure the reasoning behind it, but I loved it.  The food and drinks were good here. I had Cheese Curds for the very first time here - and I was told this is the place to get them. Well, they were delicious and I'm sure it was apparent after I ate an entire side order to myself. For lunch I had the No. 24 salad with one of their Pilsner Beers and Strawberry Apple Cider. All of the food here was good as well as their drinks. Service was a bit slow at times but not bad.  A good lunch/drinks spot to gather with friends."}
{"text":"Delicious food. It always very crowded and the wait is long but totally worth it.  The Friday fish fry is definitely worth the hype.  The portions are generous, large enough to have leftovers.  Would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We stopped at The Old Fashioned to get dinner.  I couldn't come to a place called The Old Fashioned and not try the Old Fashioned.  Some might describe Old Fashioned as an outdated disgusting grandpa drink.  I am still admititedly more of a Manhattan person, but I had to go for a change up.  You have to keep people on their toes you know.  The drink was well mixed and sweet but not too sweet. For an appetizer we decided on the cheese curds.  It was kind of a no brainer since the y appeared on Food Nework's Best Thing I Ever Ate and that was one of the draws to get us into the place.  They came with a choice of sauces and thinking I would probably never be there again, I thought why not pay the extra 50 cents per sauce in order to try them all. The cheese curds were little fired pillows of heaven.  Nice and crisp.  The cheese inside was absolutely amazing and some of the best that I have tasted.  I thought that the sauces would be overkill and to be honest, the curds themselves kind of don't even really need much else.  The sauces do accent things pretty well, and did make a nice place for me to dip the fries that came with my burger. The sauces were: -Ranch: Pretty much self-explanatory and one of the only ones I probably could have skipped, but then again, ranch is a perfect combo with cheese. -Roasted Garlic: My hands down favorite, but admittedly I am a bit of a garlic fiend. -Blue Tiger:  Which I didn't know what to expect but it kind of tastes like a spicy blue cheese dressing -One of them was pink, and I thought it was the best to be fair our server didn't tell us which one was which. The burger was also a huge win.  You can't argue with how great value it was to get a burger that was grass feed beef and locally raised pork all with that Wisconsin cheddar.  Looking at the menu I knew which burger to choose almost immediately and I knew it was going to be the one that will be affectionately remembered in my heart as the number thirty.  Everything you wanted was on this burger, perfect juicy beef, crisp thick bacon, fresh sharp cheddar, more of that wonderful garlic sauce, crispy fried onions and of course an over medium egg to top everything off. Real burgers have that soft cooked egg.  There is no better feeling than to pick up your burger, take a big bite and have that yolk run down your hands coating the burger in it's magical goodness.  It wasn't long before I finished that burger and was nearly too full to walk.  We had about an hour left before the concert, so  we opted for a couple more drinks.  The Old Fashioned has a beer list that truly does an Wisconsin establishment proud."}
{"text":"What can I say? This place is a madison classic for a reason. Dinner items and beers are excellent. Appetizers are great. I am however not terribly impressed with the breakfast. One thing to keep in mind is that  during peak hours the wait can be an hour or more in order to get a table. Therefore the off-peak hours are a good time to slip in. One complaint that I've heard from a number of people is that due to the tin ceilings the place is very loud when packed."}
{"text":"I'm always glad when I chose a local favorite.  Great food, reasonable prices and a real classic.  Ate at the bar. Walleye and BLT with heirloom tomatoes. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"We decided that we wanted to see the concert that was at the capital and got downtown around 7:45, put our name on a list (they text you when your table is read!) and were seated outside around 8:30. We were able to enjoy each other's company and the live concert!   We went to The Old Fashioned because we saw an article stating that we needed to try the fried cheese curds at this location. While in town, we had tried a couple of different places for cheese curds but this really took the cake! Since we were traveling for business the waiter said he could get us all the sauces to try (which I recommend doing) because they are all so tasty!  After the cheese curds, I opted for the Fatty Boombalatty which went well with my Spicy Burger. The spice burger was delicious, it had local grass-fed beef (love it!) with pepperjack cheese, jalapenos, fried onions, bacon and paprika! As a New Orleans lady, spicy stuff does not impress me but something on this burger made my eyes water! They know how to use their spices.   The cheese curds were so good, my coworker ordered some as a side for her prime rib sammy!  If I didn't want to try a new restaurant for every meal, I would return!"}
{"text":"30 minute wait for a table of 8 so we got some drinks at the bar. Plenty of beers on tap, friendly bartenders, and yummy manmosas (a mimosa x's 3!) We got sat at a table that should have only sat 6, but we got cozy and made it work. Everything at the table was good but nothing memorable or outstanding. I had the walleye sandwich with a salad. The walleye was huge and crispy but pretty flavorless. I hate having to put a ton of tarter sauce on it. My bf ordered the grilled cheese and wasn't too thrilled about it. We're in Wisconsin! How do you mess up cheese??? The table had a variety of mini donuts, chili, beer and cheese soup (which I guess is the best thing to order), omelets, and corn beef hash. Again, no complaints but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night for dinner with a few friends from out of town.  The Old Fashioned is one of the \"go to\" places for dinner with folks that have never been.  It's supper club roots are something that many people are not accustomed to, that and a drink selection this extensive.    Great menu!  My two favorites, being The Old Fashioned Burger (No. 30 - with the added braunschweiger) and the Walleye Sandwich (No. 36), are always difficult to choose between.  I try to alternate my selection between visits.  The cheese curds are easily within my Top 5 ever.  They are a tad greasy, but not in an awful way.  My wife is a huge fan of the salads as well.    We lucked out by beating the rush by minutes.  It is always a gamble as they do not take reservations.  I was surprised at the speed and quality of the service given how busy it was.  With a complete package like this, topped with a delicious brandy old fashioned, it will not be difficult to return time and time again."}
{"text":"Four stars for The Old Fashioned.  Mainly those four stars are for the drinks & beers here though.  I respect a place that not only names itself after a classic cocktail, but one that has also has a great selection of Wisconsin beers; from top of line brews that include multiple selections from New Glarus, Gray's, Capital Brewery, Harbor City Brewing Company & Sprecher to lesser beers that may or may not give you gut rot, like Pabst, Rhinelander, Old Style, Hamm's and Schlitz.    The food is classic Wisconsin food that can be found in countless restaurants and brew pubs across Madison & the rest of state.  The difference here is that the Old Fashioned takes many of those staple dishes found across the state and spruces them up a bit.    What does that mean?    It means that instead of normal condiments and french fries as a side dish, you get things like lemon-caper tartar sauce, dill potato salad, pickled beets, smoked paprika sauce, spinach & beet salad, etc.    I personally dig it.  Yeah, I'm paying for a fancy version of food I can find down at Fat Jack's, or the Silver Eagle Bar & Grill in Monona, but it's the little things that spice up life, right.  Plus here, my veggie friends can still find some quality food on the menu instead of just having to eat a basket of cheese curds (of course they could still do that here too)."}
{"text":"Phenomenal place to grab a hand crafted old fashioned of your liking. Right on capital square and fun atmosphere. A very popular place to go so if you go around dinner time expect somewhat of a wait. Overall a great place to go to."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning after a stroll around the farmers market. The bloody Mary and fried cheese curds were amazing!! I had number 24 and a side of bratwurst. Cam at about noon and there was a 30 min wait."}
{"text":"Very good place but had a long wait.  Walked around the town square with my boyfriend and then had a nice dinner.  We got the cheese curds and cheese soup for appetizers.  The curds were a bit soggy and a bit disappointing for WI.  The soup was great.  I also got the Spotted Cow beer on tap and it was great!  Dinner was burgers which were large portioned and really good."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Went on a Saturday night and the place was packed. 30+ minute wait was well worth it. The dining rooms next to the bar can get a little noisy but if you request a table upstairs you will be able to enjoy your meal with a beautiful view of the capitol building and not have much pass-through traffic.   I got the spicy burger (waitress recommended), a house bock beer (similar to Shiner), and their wedge salad. All were excellent and I would easily order them again. I'd best describe their menu as elevated bar food. All of it was executed quite well, perfectly seasoned, and had a refinement you don't find in many bar/grills. And don't forget to add the fried cheese curds as an appetizer!   I ended the meal with there rye old fashioned and was a little disappointed in how weak the alcohol was in it. It was tasty and presented well but barely even had a shot in it!  Hit this place up next time you are down town Madison and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The bar was great for a bloody but the wine terrible.  The food was overrated and not good. I don't understand why people are waiting for a table. My wife had the rubber ribeye and I tried my fave fish walleye. One of the worst and last place I'd recommend to go to. Absolutely terrible! Must be the location or the people there are too drunk to realize that the food is nasty."}
{"text":"HOLY CHEESECURDS!  The Old Fashioned reminds me of why I love dining in Wisconsin.  Great beer, fried cheese curds, quantity food, and less than 5% tax.  We visited the capitol building across the street and stopped by the Old Fashioned for a bite before heading back into Chicago.  My finace got a walleye fish sandwich with a wedge salad. Man - the sandwich had the largest piece of fried fish I've ever seen! And the salad - mountains of blue cheese, french dressing, and bacon! I could have made a meal with the side salad alone!  My prime rib sandwich was only about $10 and I just couldn't resist upgrading my side to cheese curds for $3...best decision ever!  Everything was SO good.  And the beer - OH THE BEER. A pint of local, double IPA on draft for $5.50? I'll take it any day."}
{"text":"Great place! Always good food and quick service. Although you might have to wait a bit for a table during the busy time, it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great service great food - had the prime rib sandwich and the wife had the walleye Sandie both top notch add the brandy old fashioned and a spotted cow for a true 5 stars"}
{"text":"If 0 was available it would apply here.  I don't like to base my ratings on service at restaurants, but this one is necessary.  First, there was an hour wait to get in, early on a Saturday night.  The wait is no biggie to me but I've dined at downtown Madison restaurants 10x better and sat when I entered.  Enough said there. Our service here was beyond hideous.  Our party was 7 people, two families ranging from 5yrs old to 65yrs old.  When our waitress finally came to our table after sitting for 15 minutes, she proceeded to take two drink orders before trying to walk away.  Each person in turn had to say 'excuse me, I'd like a drink too' as she attempted to walk away.  By the time she got to me she had turned to walk away before I asked to order a drink myself.  When I asked for my drink she snottily replied \"what\" in the rudest possible way, as if I had insulted and bothered her by asking for a drink.  Those drinks, by the way, took another 15 minutes to receive, and were served by someone else.   Service taking our food orders sucked as well.  Our waitress didn't ask what side anyone wanted and just assumed and wrote down what she wanted.   On to the food..which was badly overrated.  I ordered a common sandwich which I tend to order everywhere I go.  It was bland and the fries on the side weren't worthy for one of the pigeons on the sidewalk. Do yourself a favor and try any one of the other fine restaurants in the downtown Madison area, but stay clear of this DUMP."}
{"text":"Usually busy, but worth the wait. Their old fashioned technique is quite impressive, and their food and decor is worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. The walleye sandwich was bland. The recommended salad was iceberg lettuce with a few carrots- it was sad. Redeeming qualities were cheese curds, bloodys, and the burger which was good per my companion. The value is there though, all entrees about $10. And $5 old fashions. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds in Madison (we've tried just about all of them)! Their sandwiches and burgers are good, but not our favorite. Really affordable food prices and a good drink selection for a cheap date night. We always take out-of-town visitors here!"}
{"text":"It has taken a few years and moving away from Madison to make me a believer in the Old Fashioned. But I do really feel that this iconic tavern/supper club deserves all the hype that it gets and that it has redeemed itself after my average review of it a few years ago.  First of all, I agree with Steve L. that the cheese curds can be massively greasy... but with that grease comes a ton of flavor. I've had cheese curds that are technically better--crispier, bigger curd, etc. but there's something about the ones at the Old Fashioned that are so addictive.  That being said, I think that the Old Fashioned has a lot of items that they do well and cause less controversy.  Their signature burger: a thick, local, medium-cooked beef patty on a toasted roll with bacon, cheese, grilled onions, and topped with a soft cooked fried  egg can be mind-blowing when done right (I've ordered it a number of times and once or twice the meat was overcooked and made me very sad).  Their fish frys are amazing, too, as well as the Wurst platter, featuring Fitchburg's Bavaria kitchen's sausages as well as some tasty pickles, sauerkraut, and buttery toast points. And, of course, their signature drink, the Old Fashioned made the Wisconsin way--with brandy--is a great drink to go with your meal.  The Old Fashioned is kid-friendly, though it can be a little dark and loud for the kids. They have a kid's menu with tasty dishes (like the aforementioned macaroni and cheese from my first review), offer broccoli as a side for some dishes, and have regular and chocolate milk from Sassy Cow Creamery.  Like so many other places in Madison, the Old Fashioned celebrates local products, but this place takes its Wisconsin pride to another level. In addition to using local meat and cheese in many of their items, as well as having many dishes that are Wisconsin favorites, they have over 100 (I believe around 150) Wisconsin beers on tap and in bottles. And we have never ordered a beer here that we haven't liked.  I feel bad giving the Old Fashioned a so-so review a few years ago. But I've really come to appreciate the food and philosophy behind this place. It's usually very hard finding a seat at the Old Fashioned at dinnertime, even with its expansion a few years ago, which is great because this is truly an amazing establishment in Madison."}
{"text":"Busy place! A BIG drink menu with lots of interesting beer choices... Our group of four felt in the way at the bar but were rewarded with a GREAT table by the windows overlooking the Capitol. Food was hearty Midwestern fare that was tasty & priced really well. Will be back on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite spots back in the day, but I'm not sure if my taste has changed or what it is... I just didn't enjoy it as much as I did.  I think it was mainly the food and not so great service... they still have a great selection of local beer :)"}
{"text":"The Wisconsin burger and cheese curds were so delicious! My burger had this yummy mayo and olive oil sauce that combined with the cheese and onions really made it an outstanding burger. The cheese curds were hot, crispy and full of goodness!  The beer selection was solid too, as was the service. I tried the Magic Strawberry cider. Overall, a great place to grab a beer and a bite!"}
{"text":"I can see why the Old Fashioned is a Madison institution. The house burger was delightful, and the cheese curds were better than the rest that I've had in town. The chili comes with spaghetti which was weird but enjoyable. I can picture it being really solid in the thick of winter.  The beer list is good too. There's a wide selection of taps and an even wider selection of bottles. Plus the service is great."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you're visiting UW or just Madison in general. It is also good for a night out with a group of friends. They don't take reservations, but the longest I've waited was 30 minutes.  The chicken sandwich is good, but my favorite dish is the Mac and cheese. It's delicious!!! I can never finish it, but it's just as yummy the next day."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was seated immediately. Had the spicy burger medium-rare (it wasn't; it came out well done but I hate wasting food) with cheese curds & black IPA. Food was okay and service was polite, but I would have liked my burger the way I ordered it."}
{"text":"We were told to try an old fashioned here. Go figure! We arrived on Friday for a late lunch and we're glad we did. They got busy quick! Packed with a wait by 5pm. Had a whiskey sweet Old fashioned and decided to try their house burger and cheese curds. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Down side is that everyone seems to come here before a show. Sunday night, still had a 20 minute wait for two people. Plan accordingly.  Had a chicken-bacon sandwich on fresh sandwich bread. Absolutely amazing, cooked perfectly, right proportion of mustard to flavor. Tried the cheesecurds because everyone mentions them, but honestly, not impressed. My guess is that they are 70% breading to 30% cheese. Its the beer-batter kind of breading. I should have gone with the fries.  Excellent service from our waitress. Fast, pleasant but not chatty. Super quick with the check when asked."}
{"text":"After seeing this restaurant on a Food Network show, we had to stop by and try the cheese curds. We also ordered the beer cheese soup and an old fashioned burger. Everything was great and extremely cheesy.  We also love beer flights and this restaurant specializes in them."}
{"text":"I've heard for a while that this was the spot to go in Madison but hadn't been there until now.  It definitely doesn't disappoint.  It was primetime on a Saturday when we stopped in so we were perfectly okay waiting for close to an hour.  Both sides of the bar were absolutely packed but we were able to find a little elbowroom and grab some drinks and an order of cheese curds--which were scrumptiously chewy.  They have a massive selection of taps but I decided to drink their house beer for some reason.  When we were seated our waitress was clearly knowledgeable and super generous.  She directed me towards the house burger, which was topped with bacon and onion rings.  From the greasy food to the awesome beer to the friendly environment, this place is a slice of Wisconsin and anybody looking for a good meal in Madison should check this place out."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds ever and I know cheese curds lol  Great food .  Only warnings is it does get jam packed and they don't take reservations but so worth it :)"}
{"text":"Because 2 for 1 burgers are apparently a thing in Madison.  I just moved here and I fell IN LOVE with this place.   Great menu, great service, food is decent, the menu is a little daunting...but that's why I will be back.   You know something is right at a restaurant when there is a 45 minute wait on a Monday night."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the city. Whenever someone comes to town I say this restaurant is a must as it's quintessential Madison. The prices are good and the food is GOOD. You can't go without ordering the cheese curds; they're the best in town. I really like the summer sausage sandwich. Obviously their old fashioneds are awesome.   One of the downsides is the long wait, but it's just a sign of how damn good this place is. Go before you're hungry and have a drink at the bar. It's worth it and often times the wait is much shorter than they say it'll be."}
{"text":"Their fish and chips are good. Wait time..... that's another story, specially if you go on a Friday night. You will be waiting up to 40 minutes or more. You will have to try their cheese curds, though. And on Mondays, they have buy one burger and the second is free. However you will have to specify that, that is what you would like, otherwise you will be charged full price for 2 burgers. Like me. Aren't servers smart? I mean..... you know that's what you offer every Monday, why would you think otherwise. Ask. It won't hurt. #SMH."}
{"text":"Best Wisconsin beer-battered cheese curds! The wait on a Saturday was over an hour so we chose to get our food to go."}
{"text":"this is the traditional place of american burger but I like it. the cheese is very delicious, as expected from wisconsin. dont really have particular favorite burger but I tried cheeseburger and it was very good. a bit packed on the night and weekend especially. better to come earlier to save your spot (bcs unfortunately you cant make reservation first.)"}
{"text":"I've came here a few times before and enjoyed the food/drinks. We walked in tonight and the lady in the front was checking IDs (which is okay). BUT the lady did not allow us to enter and enjoy the night with my 6 family members who came to visit from New Jersey. My mom is 62 years old and because my mom did not have her ID we were not seated. A 62 year old lady not having an ID shouldn't have stopped us from entering..RECOMMENDING THIS TO NO ONE."}
{"text":"The best Old Fashions in Madison! The fish fry is to die for on Wednesdays and Fridays. German food is great! Very informal, pleasant staff, good service. Great cheese curds too! Come to dinner early, the place fills up fast."}
{"text":"I specifically chose Madison, WI as a cross country road trip pit stop and I could not have found a better place to satiate my appetite for some tasty Midwestern grub. The restaurant is located across from the capitol which concerned me over wait time for dinner on a breezy summer weeknight but we were able to get a table right when we walked in. The cheese curds were lovely (the dipping sauce was my favorite part) and I helped myself to an Old Fashioned, because obviously. I had the fish fry, my mom the roast beef sandy with a large helping of salad greens. My fish was lightly battered and there was no mushiness of the fries or fish typical of this kind of dish. We both thought are meals were delightful & plentiful (we both finished ~1/2 of our plates). I would recommend to anyone for a pleasant overall experience! We also stumbled upon concerts in the square across the street which only added to our enjoyment of the evening."}
{"text":"Worth the 45 minute wait on a Wednesday night. We were able to find a seat at the bar while we waited and had a couple drinks and appetizer. Everything about this place was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place endlessly, so after living in Madison almost a year I figured it was high time I gave it a shot. My girlfriend and I came here on a sunny April Saturday afternoon around 3. The hostess was kind and informed us the only seats available were right in front of the door or on the bar, so beware this place gets busy all the time. We sat at the bar and were greeted with menus right away. Their drink menu is fantastic and full of local beers and I love how it tells you where the beer comes from! Plenty of mixed drink options too that sounded interesting. The prices stood out to me as I thought we would be paying a hefty sum but it is actually very affordable with most beer pints at 5 dollars and a few at 3 or below! I had heard all about old fashioned having the best cheese curds so you know I had to try them and wow did they live up to the hype. I was never a cheese curd lover but now I see why they get so much love. They were perfectly gooey and not too fried, eat them quickly though because they will get soggy. The roasted garlic dip was perfect with them and so was ranch. We split a walleye fish sandwich with fries and the bartender, who was great and gave us plenty of conversation, took it upon herself to make sure it was split into two even plated portions which I thought was a very sweet touch. The meal was well done to me but we both thought the tarter sauce was a little on the sweet side and had a weird tangy taste we couldn't quite pin down, and the bread was very buttery but hey it is Wisconsin. The fries were salted well and the meal on the whole was a 7 out of 10. Love the decor in here too"}
{"text":"Good food. A little over-priced. Huge drawback is that they don't provide waiter/waitress table service at lunch time. You have to order from the bar."}
{"text":"The old-fashioned house burger always brings a smile to my face, and a pain to my heart.  Covered with thick cut bacon, a fried egg, aged cheddar, and served in a buttered bun, this delectable burger will make you happy.  Excellent beer menu, great brandy old fashions.  The house burger's always been so good I never explored much of the menu.  But given my satisfaction with it, I can't imagine the rest of the food would not satisfy."}
{"text":"I went here with a girlfriend on a Friday evening. We had a 45 minute wait for a table for two. The bar area was pretty crowded, but to be expected during that time of day. My friend enjoyed her Old Fashioned, and I got some summery concoction that was just the ticket. The bar staff was prompt and helpful.   Once seated we ordered a cheese tray and a lazy susan. The cheeses were delightful! I would order this again. The lazy susan was fun, but a little disappointing--the pickles, potato salad, and deviled eggs were good, but the other items were forgettable.   Our waiter was aloof. He'd ask if we had questions, but didn't really want to answer any. He wasn't incredibly attentive--although was timely with the bill and beverage refills."}
{"text":"Told this was one of the places to go when in Madison---ummm no. The MOST rated restaurant on Yelp--really? On a Thursday after a productive week, we  headed over to the State Capital. I was seriously excited!  Was going to try the Bird Cage that everyone has posted, and would try the cheese curds, Mac and Cheese and possibly some form of meat. Was really in it for the Bird Cage and new friends. Parking is NOT easy. There is construction right in front yet found a meter which stops at 6 pm. SCORE. Goes down hill after parking and seeing the drink menu.    Expected to wait, it was Thursday and a perfectly beautiful day in Madison. We were seated quickly, Also SCORE. Had someone take our drink order as well as bring 1 more menu as we were given 1 less than needed. When drinks came, the guy disappeared so fast some of our party was mid sentence trying to order. They were NOT that busy to be running away from a question or order. New server at the helm and ready.   Our server may have been having a rough day, she seemed off, but she did the job. Had the Lazy Susan, the 1st one. The pate i could not figure if it was chicken, duck or goose. Deviled eggs OK, nothing spectacular, salmon did not seem fresh, Hearring, well it is an acquired taste. Salami and white cheese were good, White was better than orange cheese. It had no taste. Was it worth the 16 dollars for the Ritz and a few slices of bread, meh not so much but OK. Get me that Bird Cage, bring us the Mac and Cheese, bring us a few burgers 1 with an egg. This is THE place to be. Still had optimistic hopes  Sadly no more Bird Cage? Wha?!!!?! Huge Bummer. Burgers were cooked order. I had the spicy burger and friend had regular. I did not taste any extra spice, but I appreciated it being medium rare. Bacon was good. I had the bunless and egg. They charge 1.50 for a bun and a 1.00 for the egg. Cheese curds were good, but lost on 1/2 of us, but happy we had a chance to try.  I have tried them and now can say I did. Burgers come with fries or salad. I opted for salad, dressing had no flavor, so I asked for a different 1. No flavor again. Gave up, had enough to call it a dinner.  Egg was cooked nicely. OK meal. Not too expensive except the Lazy Susan...not really worth the price tag.  No Bird Cage. Large Whiskey and Beer selection, decent wine and on the back of the drink menu it said Booze. Funny.   Ready to call it a night waiting for the check. One of our dishes was the Mac and Cheese. This was supposed to be the signature dish. It was cooked awful. It tasted like they messed up the flour to cheese and butter ratio. It was not good. We left 2/3 rds on the table. Mentioned this to the server not having the best day and she did not say anything, zero zilch. Also one of our glasses was chipped. We handed that over. Again, nothing was said. Nothing was fixed.  Seriously!!??!?!! My last statement was, you may not want to serve that again, it was not good. Again nothing. Not even, gosh that sucks, or sorry, or thanks for bringing me the glass that could have cut one's lip...nada. Left a bad impression.   Why someone would wait in line for more than 15 minutes is something I do not comprehend. If the lunch was served quickly for the downtown workers, I would see this as a regular albeit OK spot, but nothing to write much more about.   If coming for your Epic training, this is not one of the must have to try places."}
{"text":"I mean, I don't really have anything new to add. It's such a great \"Wisconsin\" place i.e. great cheese curds and beers. Old fashions were cheap too, so that's even better. The wait might be a little long, but just grab a beer and hang out. Would totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5.    This was our first time in Madison, and I decided I was going to have cheese curds come hell or high water, since I'd also never had those before!    Around the table was a sandwich, a burger, and lots of curds and fried onions.  The curds and the onions were a bit of a highlight, but I felt so guilty afterwards...I suppose I should've been better prepared for that.  Otherwise, the meal seemed like fairly standard bar fare - great for a diet-busting lunch!  Prices and service were fine, too - it was a pleasant and unhurried meal looking out towards the capitol building."}
{"text":"COST: $9.95 (Prime Rib Sandwich) $4.95 (Matchstick Fries) $8.95 (Mac & Cheese) $5 (Kessler's Old Fashioned IN A PINT)  Coming from Los Angeles and then Chicago, this place was heaven. The food and drinks were delicious and the prices are unbeatable. Definitely got spoiled here over a weekend trip and it would pain me to pay higher prices now that I'm back in Chicago.  Madison and this place are just too awesome for words. The ambiance and service were great.   The sandwich and fries were amazing as was the cheesy goodness of their Mac & Cheese. One would hope they'd nail their cheese seeing as I was in Wisconsin and that they did.  My favorite is definitely the $5 pint of hard liquor. I mean come on!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes - I hereby declare that no foodie's trip to Madison, WI is complete without an obligatory stop at the Old Fashioned. 2 pairs of sisters decided to grab a late dinner and were quoted an agreeable wait time of 45 minutes. We tried to find a spot to grab a drink before dinner but our plans were follied by short bursts of heavy rain showers. We returned to the restaurant and sat at the bar while we sipped on some libations. The cherry old fashioned drink was a bit of a letdown, as I was expecting a more smoothly crafted drink. Rather, I could taste the individual ingredients and felt that it lacked a smooth finish.   After we were seated, we ordered a round of cheese curds. Everyone should order these! Fresh cheese curds, lightly battered and fired to perfection served with an excellent complement of creamy mildly horseradish sauce! I was very tempted to order a second round.... Each of us also ordered a burger and no one was disappointed :) The meat to bun ratio was on point and all of the accoutrements only added to the Wisconsin meat and dairy nirvana. I tried another beverage - a seasonal martini with a blueberry flavor but was not impressed. That being said, I will gladly drive over from Chicago over and over again for the excellent food and keep trying out different old fashioned cocktails until I find my favorite."}
{"text":"Each of the three times I went, the drinks were nothing special and the food was average to passable, yes, even the cheese curds. Nothing about this place stood out for me to make me want to make it a regular haunt. And when you've gone to a place three times and each time was uninteresting, why go back again for a fourth time?"}
{"text":"The bar tender helped me navigate the extensive beer menu. All his choices were great. I also ordered cheese curd (with the paprika sauce), beer cheddar soup, and the wurst platter. The wurst platter is the best, the fried cheese curds are out of this world, and the soup is very... Cheesy. I may not get the soup again, but I will certainly go back given the chance. Absolutely great food, great atmosphere, and the bar tenders know their brews."}
{"text":"Came here in the middle of a road trip. I wanted to experience something quintessentially Wisconsin, and Yelp led me in the direction of The Old Fashioned. The food was really good, the decor was supper club classy and the beer was local and tasty. We went on a Monday before 5, which meant crazy deals. 2 for 1 beer and burgers meant we saved a lot of money. The cheese curds made me a little queasy, but that's only because they tasted so good that I didn't stop when I should have."}
{"text":"This was our first stop of the day. Really wanted to try an old fashioned but felt it too early in the day. (\"Too early?\" WTF??? I know!) Went with a mimosa instead and that hit the spot.   I heard the cheese curds here were the best, so had to try them of course. What I heard turned out to be true. Effin delicious! Probably not the healthiest way to start a day, but who cares!   Had the breakfast sandwich too. English muffin was much more dense than I expected but it was really good. The egg was perfectly cooked and when the yolk broke all over, what a delicious mess that ended up being.   Next time, an old fashioned for me. And please, more cheese curds!"}
{"text":"\"Stately and pleasantly it sat, A compact house and strong. Then I went in: The door of it was hung beef, the threshold was dry bread,  cheese-curds the walls.\" -12th Century Traditional Celtic Song.  Who knew that cheese curds were musical? I had a hunch, but, until last night, I hadn't had the opportunity to sing their song. They are squeaky balls of fried goodness that locals may take for granted, but this chronic traveler is freakin excited about them. If you wanna devirginize your curdishness, please do it at Madison's The Old Fashioned. That they are just a side dish to a full menu of amazing food and drink is a bonus.  A production of Madama Butterfly brought me to Madison, and The Old Fashioned was recommended to me by many locals. So a few colleagues and I ventured over from our place nearby on Capitol Square, on a frigid, snow-flurrying Sunday evening.   The menu is fairly big, but unlike some of the major pubfood-make-a-pig of-yourself-chains, each item on this local gem's menu seemed to relate somehow to each other. It was as if you could choose any three things from the menu, in any combo, and have a great meal.  After a pal and I shared the fried cheese curds and stopped crying from the pleasure, I chose the Old Fashioned Burger. It was perfectly done, and crowned with a delicious fried egg. The gooey yolk (called dippy eggs where I come from) mixed with the \"garlic sauce\" on the burger. Is it sad that I could have eaten two of these? My colleagues had the Scandavian Chicken dinner and the salmon salad. Perhaps the chicken was a little dry, but it was such a generous, fresh portion that you found a way to adjust your taste buds to enjoy the dryness. It's sorta like pretending to enjoy the taste of shrooms when preparing to trip out on them. The payoff is worth it.  This was all chased with a New Glarus Organic Revolution, which was on tap for $2.50 a pint (what?) and a piece of the apple pie with aged Wisconsin cheddar on top. When I say a piece, I mean an entire wedge.  I have a few more weeks in Madison, and am looking forward to trying a few other things at the Old Fashioned.  The menu of \"lazy susans\" really has my attention right now....one with brats and sausages and  deviled eggs...come on.  Squeaky curds-freakishly addictive, like the finest, phattiest herbal blunt, but way cheaper."}
{"text":"If you've never tried the Old Fashioned, you must do so ASAP.  First thing's first: Try the cheese curds. Best you'll ever have. It's not just about the beer battered cheese curds themselves, but about the amazing dipping sauce that comes with them. Simply awesome.  Everything I've ever gotten there was really good and quite reasonably priced. Good size portions that will either fill you up and/or leave you with a to-go box.  I'm not much of a drinker, so I can't really say anything about their bar. However, from the looks of it, it seems to be well stocked with a variety of alcohol to meet everyone's drinking needs.  The only possible downside to The Old Fashioned is the wait. Often there is a bit of a wait to be seated. I've only had to wait 15 minutes or so, but I've only ever gone at lunch time. I'm assuming dinner could get pretty crazy.  If your looking for a good place that serves an awesome burger/salad/sandwhich and some KILLER cheese curds, look no further."}
{"text":"The old fashioned here is very special (well since it's in the restaurant name) and truly delicious. They crush an orange peel and cherry together with the sugar and bitter, which is kinda unique from all the old fashioned recipes I tried online. It's a little sweet but I really like it!! The hot dog is delicious too, with the true texture of meat (not some lousy starchy flavor). We also ordered onion rings and cheese curds, portion size is very Wisconsin. My second favorite American restaurant in Madison!"}
{"text":"It's always super busy, but that's because it has everything you could want in a Wisconsin themed restaurant! I would recommend going for a drink with a group and ordering one of the lazy susans and some cheese curds."}
{"text":"Classic Wisconsin fare and one that should not be missed if you're in town visiting.  Wait times can be long for dinner, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Def the best place you will find near the confines of the Capitol building. Great beer selection. Lively place. The wait was going to be 25mins but we were texted ( I like the text feature ) by the hostess in just a few minutes. The cheese curds were really amazing, some of the best curds I have in dairy land. Service was great. The only reason for the 4 instead of 5 is I wasnt crazy about the Walleye sandwich. It was good but maybe just too much batter and bread or me, I ended up taking it apart to pick at the meat. That said, everything else looked great around us and I would definitely come back to try other menu items.   Great place!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food at phenomenal prices. Their salads were large and cheap, fried cheese curds were fantastic as was their beer cheese soup. The sandwiches my friends got were also great.  Don't leave Madison without going to the Old Fashioned!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, very mediocre food. Indifferent wait staff. Don't get the vegetable sandwich, it is very bland. Beer cheese soup was okay and cheese curds were ok. Pulled pork was just pulled pork, no special flavor, really not much for flavor in general."}
{"text":"Very popular and does not take reservations. Tried for lunch yesterday (90 minute wait), dinner (ditto) before finally getting in today for breakfast. Food was good and different. I had walleye and eggs! Vegetarian options available. Service was really slow despite the restaurant not being that busy."}
{"text":"The CHEESE CURDS. Given that this is what they're famous for, I expected them to be pretty good, but they exceeded my expectations. Better than cheese curds I've had at other Madison restaurants!  My main dish of Fish & Chips was unfortunately not as spectacular. While certainly not a bad dish, it fell a little short after the delicious cheese curds.  Overall, my experience was good though! I would advise coming at odd times, since it gets RIDICULOUSLY crowded after 5:30 PM. It's certainly a famous place for a reason."}
{"text":"This place is always packed.  The food is always amazing and the portions are on the heavy side.  The staff and bartenders are very friendly and knowledgeable.  They seem to do a good job of retaining good quality staff.  This establishment is also gay owned and very gay friendly.    The Old Fashioned is always packed and you should expect a (worth while) wait most nights.  You cannot make reservations but they do have a high tech waiting list that will text you when your table is ready and tell you how many people are ahead of you.  I've never waited more than 45 minutes even with larger groups."}
{"text":"My favorite place to \"drink.\" I don't care too much about the food. But their \"Bourbon Old Fashioned\" is fantabulous. Also, unlike a lot of state street places, the place is much more for grown ups. The bar has nice thick wood counter, the bartenders are professional and they do know how to mix good drinks.   Friday nights gets crazy busy, but Tuesday / Wednesday late nights are more manageable and relaxing."}
{"text":"I've been to the old fashioned a few times and each time is... meh... obviously great beer selection, but that's really about it. Waiting 45 minutes for subpar service and food isn't my thing.   One time we were given a 45 minute wait time, sure, that's fine.. we were seated, and waited another 10 for our server to arrive. Communication issue? Understaffed? Forgot about us? Not sure.. but not impressed.   Cheese curds are decent but in entirety, not my cup of tea when it comes to comfort food.   I may give it another shot, but wouldn't recommend it to others."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Old fashions and cheese curds will always taste like home."}
{"text":"This was good, but not great.  Lots of local beers to choose from, which is probably why it normally gets better reviews.  For people from out of town it was a neat local eatery, but nothing real memorable. It was loud, which was nice with our kids.  Kids menu was decent.  Spicy burger was ok - it was so hot at some point I couldn't really taste the flavor anymore. My husband did like the walleye sandwich."}
{"text":"This place was a flavor explosion in my mouth! The cheese curds were a gooey testament to the state's greatest product. I could have just eaten those. I also ordered the House Old Fashioned burger. The egg on top was cooked to perfection. The perfection of the gooey flavors is impossible  to describe. If I am ever in Madison again, I would try to swing in here."}
{"text":"One of my (and many other people's) favorite places in Madison! I'm a huge fan of a good old fashioned and true to their name & claim - they make a great one. Great beer selection as well and I have seen them run night specials on specific craft beers a few times already, which is a nice way to try something new. I've only dined here 2 or 3 times and every time I get a burger but I've never been disappointed and I think the beef is local which is always nice. Of course, the cheese curds are highly recommended but we all already know that ;P.   Oh, I have yet to not have seen them be super busy, even on a weeknight evening & they do not take reservations. Something to keep in mind if you would like to sit down and eat dinner here!"}
{"text":"This place and its environ always, always, always smells like charcuterie. If that sounds appealing (or just tolerable as in my case), then proceed. The portions are comically large, and they have all the classic Wisconsin-y foods. Their cheese curds are probably the best of the fancy friend cheese curds in Madison (get the Tiger Sauce). If you're into beer, this is a good spot. They also have an entire menu of Old Fashioneds, including a slushy one. Kind of fun to bring tourists. I enjoy their take on Eggs Benedict, the Wisconsin Benedict, for brunch--believe me the single is more than enough for one! The hidden gem is their weekday breakfast menu (7:30 am - 11 am). It's enough to make you want to wake up that much earlier before work."}
{"text":"While a slightly more upscale, supper club inspired concept would typically perk up the skeptic inside of me (he's a hulking beast with a sinister villain-esque handlebar mustache with his head eternally cocked to the side and one eye brow raised higher than the other), this place does it right on pretty much every level.  A wonderful ode to the state, their focus is simple: respect the rich traditions of the food that makes Wisconsin unique, in an environment that is equal parts welcoming and casual, and put it all together with a high level of service.  The menu, while large, was basically broken down mainly into some appetizers, sandwiches, and a few nightly specials.  What was impressive was the care taken to ensure that every menu item highlighted something that was Sconnie-specific.  The beer list alone makes me want to head on back to try a few that aren't distributed here in Illinois yet.  A great setting right across from the capital building, with a nice concept to pay homage to the great state of Wisconsin, The Old Fashioned is a must visit when in Madison."}
{"text":"Cheese curds were amazing! Very filling too. We order egg scramble. I really like the egg. I swear the texture is different than most eggs. My fiancé, however, enjoyed the potato that came with more. He was amazed by how good potato could taste. Had a glass of mimosa. Tasty and must have for Saturday brunch! I had a veggie sandwich. Yummy! Lots of flavors in it. I added some spicy sauce in it, which made everything even better. Great service as well. Great place!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, kind and energetic staff, and awesome atmosphere make this one of Madison's great bars!  I've had many great experiences for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and even had a nice date at the Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"Visiting from SF Bay, in early April, I suffered from the bland starchiness pervasive in Wisconsin food.  TOF made it all worth it and actually made me feel like I get ripped off in CA far too often.  With beers, I discovered the $1 snacks- pickled egg, jowl, a bunch of other stuff I can't remember.  Salty, vinegary, fatty, and adventurous; perfect match to my beers. For lunch, that burger bomb with grilled onions, cheese, and egg on top really put me over the edge.  I knew it was all fat so I picked the salad to go with it.  Didn't miss a single fry.   The bloody mary was the best I've ever had.  My pregnant wife had it virgin and I didn't miss a thing.  There's homemade pickled good thingsf in that one, too; very well made.   In a place where serving local food seems difficult, they made it seem dumb not to.  A similar experience in CA would go for twice the price."}
{"text":"This is the first place anyone takes you when you visit Madison. There is more history in here than any other establishment in town and perhaps the state, depending on how much emphasis you place on dive bars near the stadium in Green Bay.   It is always packed and noisy. The staff is overworked but the few times I have visited I have found that they always do what is needed if little else. They don't have the time to explain what kind of artisanal swine is used in the summer sausage. You don't mind so much, unless you are a true moron who doesn't have any sense of context, because it is always packed.   Oh, and you also don't mind because you're enjoying a wurst plate or a double bratwurst. Everything is homemade and fresh and best of kind. If it isn't, they aren't serving it. And people around you are laughing and having fun. And isn't that what matters? Everyone goes there because it's a great place to be.   If you want to quiz the server about the GMO levels of the milk used to form the cheese curds, there's a snooty place around the square where they are too happy to curate their menu. That place was weird and boring. So when you friend or family member suggests that you go to the Old Fashioned, expect kind of a party. And have fun."}
{"text":"I've heard raving reviews about The Old Fashioned prior to my trip to Madison and I was looking forward to our meal when we arrived early and still had to wait for a table. My expectations for this place were high and I was disappointed in the food and service.  Our server was not friendly and when we paid with cash, she shortchanged us! Unbelievable.  Additionally, the cheese curds were soggy from being completely soaked in oil and the fish and chips were over battered with more batter than fish. They do have a good variety of beers, so I would stick to The Old Fashioned for drinks only, in which case, don't wait for a table."}
{"text":"Juicy burgers made with excellent quality beef!  We went at 3:30 pm prior to a Badger Basketball game at 6 and they were very, very busy.  Choose your time for a visit wisely and the food will reward you.  Chili, beer soup and cheese curds all well above average.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner and drinks with friends. Of course you have to have an Old Fashion, which was delicious, if you are there. First time I had a burger with a egg, which was also delicious. Make reservations if you can because it is a popular place, especially if college is in session. We didn't and waited about 45 minutes which was fine as we enjoyed the bar area. Would definitely come back here!!"}
{"text":"Great old fashion beverage, pretty tasty sandwich- chicken bacon something. Bacon was not crispy the sandwich! It was a big let down... limp almost soggy bacon.  Will return though!"}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was amazing! Heirloom tomato BLT and locally grown sweet corn. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"OF has been a long-time favorite for all my family & friends and it is our default place for most holidays/celebrations. I've never had a mediocre experience there. The staff is always awesome and their Brandy Slush is the best thing ever."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good. My steak was cooked ok. I ordered medium rare but it was more medium well. Not the end of the world. However, this place was freezing cold and had terrible service. We asked to move several times but the hostess did not care and would not move our table. Our appetizer and food took a long time to arrive. The whole dinner event took about 2 hours and that was after being seated right away.  This place is also terribly overpriced. For a steak the only side option I had was fries. That's fine but don't charge $30 for basically a small piece of meat. If I wanted to pay that I'd go to a fancy establishment like the Mason Street Grille. But I didn't, this place is a bar atmosphere. Overall it's bad service, overpriced, typical Madison bs."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer connoisseur, but I have loved everything I've tried here.  And the burgers...guys, they are unreal.  I've had dreams (good ones) about the Old Fashioned House Burger.  That fried egg really does it.  Service is great and very Wisconsin-friendly.  Even at 7pm on a Saturday night, when you're told the wait will be an hour to an hour and 15 minutes, you're usually seated within 45 max.  And in the meantime, drinking delicious beer at the bar is definitely not a bad alternative."}
{"text":"I was really happy that they quickly found a place for our group of ten or twelve ona  Friday night, and the servers were really friendly. There was a pretty decent selection of beer, but I wasn't too into the \"build your own old fashioned\" concept, although drinks with a pickled egg or brussel sprouts were quite intriguing, as does the food, so maybe I just went the wrong direction."}
{"text":"Old fashioned deserves this 5 star rating for the food, ambiance and service.  I had a really fantastic meal there on Tuesday evening."}
{"text":"The night didn't start off well at the old fashioned.  We had a 1.5 to 2 hour waiting time.  The restaurant calls your table by texting your cell phone.  For some odd reason they (the restaurant) could not get the message to send to us.  After waiting for about 1.5 hours for our table I decided to go check how long it would be before our number was called.  They had bypassed us because of the cell phone problem.  After we were finally seated we order a few beers which were great.  We also ordered the bratwurst appetizer which was amazing.  For my main course I had the bacon Mac and cheese and it was terrific.  Minus having that little mess up with our table not getting called everything else tasted so great.  Suggest to everyone to try this place out but recommend going on a less busy night.  The university of Wisconsin was having family weekend that night.  Great food though!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A terrific find in the locavore vein, recommended to us by multiple locals when we tried to find a place to have lunch on Sunday before leaving to come home to NYC.    The menu is chockablock with regional dishes with locally produced ingredients, many artisanal and delicious.  Peter asked to have an item on the regular menu (Wisconsin's Best Wurst Platter) when they were only serving brunch and they were happy to oblige him.  Service was terrific--knowledgeable, friendly and well-informed.  I had a bloody mary that was slighly less good than the one I had at Smoky's the night before, but also came with a PBR chaser.  Peter had an Oktoberfest brew from the New Glaurus brewery which turns out some of the best beers I have ever had.   Peter was dying for brats and sausage, being in Wisconsin, and the selection offered did not disappoint.  Bavaria Sausage Kitchen's Nuremberg knockwurst, bratwurst and weisswurst were grilled to perfection, and served with two regional mustards, sauerkraut and grilled country bread.  I ordered the House burger, of local beef, sauteed onions, Bavaria's house-cured bacon, local cheddar, garlic sauce and a fried egg on a toasted Kaiser roll that had the DOUGH PULLED OUT over where the egg needed to go, so that the yolk would only break when you wanted it to.  It came with rosemary potatoes, which are new red bliss quarters that are battered, seasoned and fried.  Not overly greasy, they were light and fluffy and fully of potato flavor.  It was quite simply the best burger I have ever eaten, bar none.  So fresh, so delicious and so well balanced that I haven't stopped thinking about it since I left Wisconsin.  We finished with cheese plate number 4, which changes according to availability, but ours had a sheeps' milk Camembert style, a 15-year-aged cheddar style and a pecorino.  They came with walnuts, granny smith apple slices and local honey, and were the perfect way to end the meal.  Coffee was terrific too.  One of the best finds in the area.  If you love food, eat here."}
{"text":"Love the theme of this restaurant, couldn't ask for a better location, and the name \"Old Fashioned\" just screams Wisconsin!  It's s place you see and what to check out.  Tonight I decided to try the \"Green Bay\" Chili and the Sheboygan Brat Sandwich.  Which is really weird because i'm from the Green Bay/Sheboygan Area. (I must have missed home tonight!)   The brats were done well and were tasty, came with lots of fresh raw onions, but the bun was not as good as some of the real Sheboygan Rolls I have had in the past.  I would still recommend this sandwich... it was pretty good!    The part I would skip is the Green Bay Chili.  I'm assuming the \"Green Bay\" part is the fact that it had spaghetti noodles. Here's where I feel the hometown snobbery comes in,  this is no GB Chili!  I would have to guess that this is a canned Chili that is doctored with spaghetti.  More like Hormel, less like homemade.  If you want good Green Bay Chili drive 3 hours north to Kroll's (next to Lambeau).  Your welcome!  As far as The Old Fashioned, come and enjoy the great drinks,cheese curds or haystack onions, but skip the Chilli."}
{"text":"This is the first place I recommend to people coming to Madison for the first time!   Beer menu is extensive and features about 50 on tap and even more in bottles.  Cheese curds are fantastic. Get them with tiger sauce on the side.  One of my favorite places in town to get Mac and Cheese (and if you ask, they'll add it as a side to your entree even though it's not an option on the menu).  The service has always been great each time I've been here. The restaurant does not take reservations and is first-come, first-served, so prepare to wait if you come during a busy time."}
{"text":"the long waits are a bore! A pretty packed and loud place to eat/drink. I good place for a dinner/drinks out with friends. not a romantic place for dinner with your sig other. It also sucks that you have to wait until your whole party is in attendance before they will seat you. 8 of us had to wait until the 9th person showed up to join us, and there was no room to even grab a drink while we waited. the restaurant would have made a lot more money from us if we were able to get a table and order drinks and apps while we waited for our + 1."}
{"text":"I tried the walleye sandwich for the second time last night and it is a sandwich to be recognized. The only thing wrong with it is that it is, somehow, too big. But believe me when I say I will try to eat the whole thing every time.  My significant other ordered the house burger, which was delicious as well . We have been here in the past and tried specials, cheese plates and lazy susans.  While nothing has been bad (I was impressed with their cheese platters especially) I have yet to have anything that is equally as delightful as the walleye sandwich.   I highly recommend the Old Fashioned for dinner or drinks. It offers a casual atmosphere and a great location on the square."}
{"text":"Super impressed with this place. Was in Madison on a business trip and always scope out local places and this time we found this gem. Beer selection was unheard of, a coworker got a flight and it was served very stylish. I stuck with the theme of the restaurant and got a traditional old fashioned and it went down soo smooth. And for $6 a drink I wasn't sad when I went to order my 4th because I didn't feel robbed.  The drink was best old fashioned I've ever had. Seriously.  We aye dinner too and that was equally impressive. Got a burger, great beef and the GF bun actually tasted like a real bun. Wasn't missing anything. The portion was huge and the price tag awesome. If you want some good hearty food and heart warming drinks this is your place!"}
{"text":"I just moved here from out of state (grew up near nyc), and after living here for a few months I've decided this is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. There's a few reasons why:  1. I'll start off with the fact that this place has far-and-away the best cheese curds I've tasted yet. Granted I'm not a Wisconsin native, but I can appreciate good food when I see it. The Old Fashioned's curds are the tastiest, gooiest, squeakiest, and have the best texture of anywhere else I've been. They're a must-have, hands down.  2. The atmosphere is perfect. It's the kind of place where you can feel comfortable in anything from a shirt and tie to a t-shirt and shorts. It has this rustic, busy feeling that feels both modern and, well, old fashioned. The energy in the place is always happy, probably attributable to point #1.  3. The beer. I hear their cocktails are great too, but I haven't actually had them. I have, on the other hand, had several 12-snit beer flights there and I can safely say I've tasted everything they have on tap. The biggest thing is that their selection is almost entirely Wisconsin-local beers. I love that, even though (and maybe especially because) I'm from out of state. Their presentation (on giant slabs of wood) for the beer flights is pretty awesome, too.  4. The food I've had there is the only thing I might hesitate on for the 5-star rating (I'd have preferred to give a 4.5). I love their Wurst Platter (which can easily feed 3 people for about $15), and some of their burgers are very good, but I've found the food to be extremely rich and hard to take more than a few bites of. If you're into that, right on. I have a little trouble getting through meals, though. Lots of food for relatively inexpensive cost.   5. Everything else, like the service and the outdoor seating and the text system for getting a table. All outstanding."}
{"text":"If I only had time for one meal in Madison, I would spend it at The Old Fashioned. Situated downtown right across from the Capitol, the location is convenient, and it's nice strolling around the square with that view during the inevitable wait.  As for the food, what you'll find are the things Wisconsin is known for and also lots of comfort food and classics. They have burgers and meats grilled over a live fire. They have fish fry on Wednesdays and Fridays. They have lots of local ingredients. And their housemade fresh Wisconsin beer-battered cheese curds are the best cheese curds I've ever had.  The first time we went we got a basket of cheese curds ($8) for our group, and by our next visit a few days later, we had already upped that to a basket of cheese curds for every couple of people. They were that good. Incredibly cheesy but somehow not that heavy, and they didn't even need any of the sauces that came with them. I don't know what they do to them, but the flavor was just better than any other cheese curds I had while we were in Madison. It was so tempting to order more baskets but we knew we'd be full off the other food.  I initially planned to get a burger on our first visit, but couldn't pass up a chance to try the bratwurst ($9), made locally in Sheboygan and served with raw onions, pickles, and brown mustard on a roll with a side of fries. That was some good bratwurst, and I was very happy with my decision. It all worked well as a combination, and the portion of matchstick fries was so huge that I was so full when we left. I couldn't believe all that only cost $9, but the prices at The Old Fashioned are really reasonable.  On another visit, we went on Wednesday so we could try the traditional fish fry ($14). They only do lake perch on Wednesday, but if you go on Friday, you can get perch, cod, or walleye, or all three. (We did try to go for Friday fish fry another time, but sadly it was the day they were closed from the fire.) I was pretty happy with the lake perch, which was easily double the portion size I was expecting, and some of the best fried fish I've had. It came with the same fries as everything else, some housemade tartar sauce, cole slaw, and rye bread, all of which were good. Would definitely do that again.  If you're looking for affordable food downtown and want to try some of the stuff Wisconsin is known for (cheese, brats, beer, fish fry, etc), The Old Fashioned is an excellent choice. Friendly staff, good food, casual atmosphere, pretty much everything we were looking for."}
{"text":"The BEST cheese curds, great beer selection and location right by the capitol, and they make a mean Old Fashioned....a must-stop when in Madison."}
{"text":"This place has NEVER disappointed me!  It's high quality, good old fashioned comfort food in an incredibly comfortable setting. No matter what you decide to order, you really can't go wrong, but if I were to recommend anything it would be the Beer-battered Walleye Sandwich, it is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Every bite has the perfect combination of flavors, I have no idea how they do it.  The cheese curds are also amazing and you must have an old fashioned. I prefer a brandy old fashioned sweet."}
{"text":"Fantastic curds. After sampling several all over Madison, this place had the best in town. Never had an actual old fashioned, but if they're like these, they're great."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a classic of Madison, so I was told. Naturally, I had to check it out when I visited. The prices are a little high, but the quality of the food makes up for it. The wait staff was not the most attentive at all times. Overall, I would suggest you visit The Old Fashioned if you are visiting Madison."}
{"text":"Nothing says \"Welcome to Wisconsin\" like beer, brats and cheese curds...and The Old Fashioned does it all well!  We were visiting Madison and found the Old Fashioned, right across from the Capitol.   There was a short wait but we scored two seats at the bar and the bartender offered to serve us as well, which was perfect as seating is very tight in the dining rooms.  We started with bloody Mary's which were a meal in themselves--including beef jerkey and served with a shot of beer.  Who doesn't love Mimosas that are served in beer glasses???? Previous Yelpers had raved about the deep fried cheese curds and boy, were they right.  The Tiger  sauce is to.die.for.  My husband had the brat which was enough for two and I had the prime rib sandwich, which was a little salty but excellent none the less! We saw quite a few breakfast/brunch offerings being served and they looked delicious as well.  Portions are large and very reasonably priced..A large beer list with local rotators and solid service make the Old Fashioned a great choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I found myself here again on a Friday looking for something that'll satisfy my belly after a long week at work and on a cold gloomy day. New England Clam Chowder...I think yes. I also went for the spicy burger this time needing to turn up the heat. And the it did the trickn with jalapenos, papperjack cheese and whatever else was causing the fire in my mouth had me asking for refills. Almost everything on their menu is delish. You can't go wrong.  http://www.getnmahbelly.com/2012/03/the-old-fashioned-big-wisconsin-flavor/"}
{"text":"Its all in the name here! The old fashioned is absolutely the best place in Madison to get... you guessed it; and Old Fashion. They have a drink menu dedicated to just Old Fashions from brandy, whisky, rum, etc. Whatever liquor you prefer in your drink they can do it.  I particularly like there orange rum twist they have on the drink.   Fun here is also good, there cheese curds are awesome. Overall a good Madison Wisconsin staple."}
{"text":"Best breakfast! Love the No. 10! Yum!! I love the outside seating, it's perfect for people watching on the square."}
{"text":"I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!  This review is a really tough one to write.  I used love the Old Fashioned.  Hunka hunka burnin' love sort of love  But then you changed and broke my heart (sob).  In the beginning, it was oh so magical.  In the days before 45 minutes wait times, the service was impeccable, the food sublime and ambiance alluring.  You were great at so many things: lunch with a co-worker, dinner with the kids, a late night bite with my better half.  But as you became more popular, things stated to slip.  The servers became less attentive as they dealt with the never ending throng of customers.  Not only did it take longer to be seated, but it was taking longer and longer to get the food I ordered, get refills on drinks or get the check when I needed to rush out to get to a show.  Then here was that time when my table was plagued by a swarm of flies (think Amityville Horror).  When the server joked about the problems instead of taking care of it, I knew the time had come for The Old Fashioned to sleep with the fishes.  And about the food...it has slipped as well.  Back in the day, the allure of those piping hot fried cheese curds could have launched a 1,000 ships.  Now, more ofthen than not, the arrive at the table greasy and lukewarm.  Ditto for the haystack onion rings.  The allure of the grilled cheese sandwich also faded as the bacon would show up undercooked or they chef would skimp on the roasted red peppers (horror of horrors)   While nearby restaurant like Graze, Nostrano and Osteria Papavero continue to innovate and improve, you seem content to rest on your laurels.  So I hate to say it, but Fredo, you're nothing to me now. You're not a brother, you're not a friend. I don't want to know you or what you do."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is the place I go when I am entertaining out-of-town guests, otherwise I tend to shy away from it (and most of the other establishments on the square). However, this past week, after dinner with some friends on the square, we decided to stop by The Old Fashioned to have a drink and to try the cheese curds (so that we could settle the old debate of who had the better cheese curds: Graze or The Old Fashioned?)  The wait was long because they were clearing out tables and setting up for karaoke ( FYI: Wednesday night is apparently karaoke night, for those of you wanting to indulge in some drunken classics), but we were told that we could order from the kitchen at the bar, and we were welcome to any spots that we could find. Luckily, we found a row of chairs enough to fit our party at the back of the bar!  The bartenders are friendly and attentive, always managing to somehow fill our water cups even on a very busy evening. Impressive! My friend had the original Old Fashioned (of course), and I had the House Brew. We all shared a basket of cheese curds.  The House Brew was much darker and heavier than I expected. I thought the house brew would be a pale ale, but it was almost dark enough to be a lager. It was delicious though - really rich and nutty, almost like Guinness. I also thought the Old Fashioned was pretty good, although sweeter than I would have expected.   Finally, the verdict on the cheese curds? (Drum rollllllllll) We had to give Graze the crown. Although the cheese curds at The Old Fashioned are great, they aren't as battered or as crunchy as the ones at Graze, which we all agreed was what really made them shine.  Til next time!"}
{"text":"Piling on, it is good. Chhesecurds be great! Elbow to Elbow sucks but it is Mad city downtown"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Madison (and Wisconsin in general) and I went here for dinner as recommended by the hotel.  GREAT selection of Wisconsin beers and cheeses and a good choice if you're looking for something classically Wisconsin.  After tasting about 7 beers, I settled on the New Glarus Totally Naked.  Went well with my spinach salad, which in turn didn't make me feel so bad about the fried cheese curds.  Man, I am so glad they don't have those in Colorado!  It would be bad news for me (if you haven't guessed, they're a-ma-zing!).  Definitely would come again."}
{"text":"The service was incredibly slow for a weekday brunch. We waited about 20 mins for our waiter to pick up our checks. A server also spilled jelly everywhere and did not alert me that it sprayed all over my back. Not sure if I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Burger was over cooked and over seasoned. Drinks were solid along with curds. Sat us by the front door and we froze while eating also. I'd say an average overall experience."}
{"text":"The first few times I went to the Old Fashioned, I absolutely loved it. The cheese curds were fresh and at the perfect temperature and coupled with the smoked paprika sauce... Let's just say I still dream about them sometimes.  The burger with the egg is also hands down my favorite burger in the world. You just can't beat it.  I've also gotten the salmon salad and another salad that had a warm, bacon dressing as well as other things that made it really unhealthy. The exact names of both escape me but seeing as there are only like 4 salad entrees on the menu, they're not hard to find. I would definitely recommend both.  But I do have to dock a star. They don't take reservations which can lead to a frustrating 30-40 minute wait and I feel that as the restaurant has gotten more popular, the quality has gone down. The last time I went the cheese curds were super oily and soggy. I know that cheese curds aren't healthy by any means, but at least in the past I wasn't reminded of that fact with the (small) pockets of oil lingering on the curds and how the pieces were all stuck together."}
{"text":"This place always has a line and a wait. I have no idea why! The food is like fair food. Always greasy and fatty. It's cheap! I guess that's why it's always busy. I leave here feeling sick every time. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was a great place to stop. The cheese curds were worth the trip. Also if you're from an easy coast city you'll find the prices quite cheap compared to the Northeast. I had the old fashioned burger and it was excellent. It was cooked medium rare as desired. I had the error Wisconsin whiskey flight and I don't think it was in order of lower to higher proof which is there reason I heavier it 4 stars. Service was great!"}
{"text":"As a first time visitor to the lovely city of Madison, WI my tour guides took us to all the classics.  Which of course included The Old Fashioned.  We were not able to eat and get a table here due to the enormous wait, but we did get to sit at the bar and have a few bloody marys (That included jerky, pickle spears, cheese curds, pickled eggs....)  so it was basically a full and salty meal.  Their cocktail menu for the non-bloody lovers did not seem as thought out or as good brunch options.  They also infuse their own vodka with a variety of hot peppers.  After a round of shots with the bartender -- can't remember his name but he was fantastic -- we were ready to go seize the day!"}
{"text":"Great place to have dinner if you're in the neighborhood. This place doesn't take ressies which is a bummer but they were able to accommodate us fairly quickly. I had a great time here. Food and drinks were good and service was great. I had their old fashioned (of course), bloody mary and their cherry ale. As for food, we got the bacon mac & cheese, fish fry, beef jerky, sausage platter and fried cheese curds. Everything was great. I especially liked the curds! A must!"}
{"text":"I just love everything about TOF. The food...amazing! Drinks....amazing! And it's not over priced. One of my all time favorites!"}
{"text":"Nice joint located literally across from the capital building/ you can't miss it!  Inside, it's pretty vintage with a beautiful old bar with tons of nooks, huge ancient WORN bar top, old plank wood floors & many tables for diners.  First off, the draft list is outstanding.. heavy on local beers and they had more than 50 brews on draught!  Everything from PBR to New Glarus they only pack Wisconsin beers.  Large food menu as well and they are known for their cheese curds with paprika sauce.. MUST TRY!  Always busy and seems to be popular with the tourists..-1 for that.  Great stop for a few cold ones & some curds. Talk Later"}
{"text":"Great location and energetic atmosphere, but really just average for food.  Too much of their menu is fried and nothing really stands out for me.  People do rave about the cheese curds, but they are often on the greasy side for me.  Good selection of beers and better than average for bar food, but they are just average compared to many other places downtown."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of visits to this place, I like to sit downstairs at the bar. If you're lookin' for a table, they have seating upstairs and some of the tables have a really nice view of the square. Which is where I've say each time I've came for dinner.   Food quality is good, but nothing that blows my mind. Their cheese curds are pretty darn tasty, so I tend to go for drinks and curds if I'm headed to the Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"Great place to go when your family visits. Really good appetizer trays full of German goodness."}
{"text":"Never any better choice if you want a good Sconnie meal. The Old Fashioned is one of the things I miss most about Wisconsin after moving to New Orleans. HUGE tap beer selection, amazing fish fry, heavy, heavy food. Delicious, unique meals, made with local products whose origins are told right there on the menu.  The only tidbit I've learned that disappointed me slightly was that the fries are from bags in the freezer, but they are still delicious, especially when you add their Spanish paprika sauce. Still, gotta go with cheese curds from the Old Fashioned, right?  Some recommendations are:  Everything"}
{"text":"I rescind my previous review. Whatever kinks with food and service existed when the Old Fashioned opened no longer exist.  The walleye fish fry is the best in town. (and so are the aforementioned cheese curds.) You must take out of townies here."}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot in the Capitol neighborhood if we aren't feeling anything specific like seafood or steaks or something like that.   The food is ridiculously inexpensive, tastes great, and is always about twice too much to eat at once.   In the evenings there can be a fairly long wait, but you can download an app to get constant updates on your place in line. Go find a drink and hang out - enjoy the people watching!  We like to sit at the bar and watch baseball if it's in season - they'll always put the Brewers on for you if there isn't something more nationally relevant on (NBA or NHL Finals, or something like that). The bartenders are friendly and will always talk if they aren't too busy making Old Fashioneds.   It's not fancy, it isn't pretentious, it isn't expensive. It's Wisconsin. Bring your out of town friends here at least once."}
{"text":"Other than ordering from the bar being a bit of a pain for a full sized restaurant we had a great lunch here! Super beef jerky, yummy greens and tuna salad. Great Bloody Mary with tasty pickles! Walleye sandwich so-so, good kids meals."}
{"text":"I was told this place is a staple in Madison. It's easy to see why given the ambiance, but the food just wasn't that impressive.  Had the #30 house burger with cheese curds. The garlic sauce was awesome, but there were way too many onions and the burger itself was a little overcooked and definitely underseasoned. The cheddar, bacon, and egg were egg-cellent toppings.  The cheese curds seemed like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp for a little too long. Not quite crispy, not quite hot, and really just not that interesting.  Next!"}
{"text":"Favorite place in town. Love the salads and burgers. Great service. And the best deals on the square. Definitely worth the wait on the weekend. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Loved The Old Fashioned. It's perfectly situated right by the Capitol so you have a great view when you're dining. Not far from campus at all, my friend and I went there for lunch and got burgers and fries. They had a great variety of burgers to choose from, including build your own, and they were delicious! Not only did they taste good, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, and it was pretty inexpensive. Would recommend for lunch rather than dinner because the wait is typically extremely long in the evening. Will definitely head back!"}
{"text":"Walleye sandwich is amazing.  So much food and delicious.  Can't go wrong with the name sake for a drink either.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere and great service. Stopped in to try a Bloody Mary and grab a light lunch. We tried the Green Bay chili and beer cheese soup and split the heirloom tomato BLT! Soup was good not great. Beer cheeses a little watery and chili lacked tomato flavor. The chili was kind of bland needed more flavor. The BLT on the other hand was amazing. The bread was toasted perfectly and the tomato delicious. Would like to come back again to try some other menu options."}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short because this Madison land mark can only be summed up in a few words. Wisconsin Beer (ALL OF THEM), OLD FASHIONS (implied), Cheese Curds (in the heart of WI..this is a must) and classic Friday Fish Fry (as a Northern Wisconsin native I have never felt more at home while staring at the capitol from my dining table). DO IT. NOW."}
{"text":"A really solid spot to bring out of town guests. The menu is almost too big, but lots of Wisconsiny things. The curds are really tasty...salty and just the right crispiness. Not my favorite curds in town, but still high on the list.   Beer offerings are are really good for craft beer lovers. Over 40 on tap. The space layout is a little odd. There are two bar and dining areas. Prices are probably a hair overpriced for what it is, but you're paying for food and drink on capitol square, and it won't break the bank. Service is good to average. It's rare I go here without out-of-town guests because there are more convenient, better spots for food in general, but it's great to show off Wisconsin tavern fare  on the square, the food is solid, and there are lots of other good bars within walking distance to make a night of it. The beer and food menu is big enough that everyone will find something they like."}
{"text":"We visited Madison and were told by locals that this was the place to try the fried cheese curds. Boy were they right!! We were there for the 2 for one cheeseburgers as well. Cheddar of course, and they were perfect. Our first cheese curds ever --were amazingly delicious and we also got the warm potato chips. The chips were quite remarkable as well and I took half home. They were even good the second day! For 50 cents you can get a second dipping  sauce for the curds and that was worth it.  I had a Dreamcycle cocktail which was orangey and yummy. My husband had a couple local IPA and he enjoyed them. They were recommended by the waitress who was very friendly and gracious to us out-of-Towners."}
{"text":"This place is too cool! It is a bar and a diner. Their drink staple is obviously The Old Fashion. My friend got it and loved it. I got a cocktail with elder flower vodka in it-it was delicious. The bartenders were attentive and took the time to chat for a short while when they could."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place, but it just wasn't up to snuff.  Before being seated we headed to the bar and had great service at the bar as we waited. We Peru's the menu and we're pretty excited about some of the choices though it's mostly sandwiches with only four entrées plus the daily special. One seated, the service was not great. We ordered the prime rib special, the spicy hamburger, A walleye sandwich, and the onion strings appetizer.  This was no better than bar food-at best.  My order also came out wrong on the first attempt. And, subsequently as we were leaving, I had the bar to order an old fashioned. I got a snarky reply from one of the bartenders - not the excellent service I had had before at the bar. All in all, not a great experience."}
{"text":"So I was just going through my bank statements preparing for my IRS audit tomorrow and remembered this place from winter of 2008.  Best Wisconsin deep fried cheese curds I've ever had...and I've had many.  Great Old Fashioned drinks as well. Quality spot for ambiance. Had a great catch up dinner with a friend here as it was snowing. Warm and cozy wood interior. A must go to if you're in Mad Town."}
{"text":"Cheese curds and walleye are my favorite!!!!!!! I usually go to the bar, wait is too long. Always delicious"}
{"text":"Stopped by based on reviews while visiting Madison.  Neat atmosphere, great service.  Food and beer were very good.  I had the fried fish sandwich and potato salad - very good sandwich; potato salad was old school with big chunks and saucy, good.  Kids had the burgers; they liked them, I had a couple bites - very tasty beef, the kind you don't even need ketchup or mustard.  Agree with other reviewers in that the cheese curds were the best we've had.  Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I went here with too high of expectations maybe....  I did not care for the old fashioned I had here. It was WAY too sweet.   Ordered the cheese plate - It was literally a plate with 3 small slices of basic, unremarkable cheese. They gave you honey and some type of sauce, nuts and some crunchy pita chips. None of these items complimented each other. Wish I hadn't wasted my money on that. 3 mice could have came by and taken the cheese and I wouldn't have cared.  The wurst platter was good. Each of the three sausages, the mustards. bread and sauerkraut complimented the taste. However, I would have preferred to have at least 1 more variety of bread.  Cheese curds and the accompanying sauces were good.  The mac and cheese was ok. Not special.  I wanted to really like this place but I didn't. Between the food and lacking service, it's probably more of a 1.5 star."}
{"text":"Great experience. Crowded but sat at the bar. Bartender took care of us immediately. Had the Wurst Platter. Great midwestern Madison faire."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant for out of towners. A true Sconnie experience with food like my Milwaukee grandma used to make. Not any vegetarian choices but a few. The booze is off the hook, especially the mixed drinks. Desserts all have ice cream with them - and why not? Our dairy is the best. Crowded - come early. Surprisingly cheap for downtown. Lots to love."}
{"text":"This is a Madison/Wisconsin must try. If your visiting, it's a great place to try Wisconsin food. From beer cheese soup to cheese curds to Mac & cheese.  Pair your food with an Old Fashioned cocktail.  If your not up for some fried food or cheese, their salads are delish as well."}
{"text":"Just go! Everything was outstanding.  The Sunday night chicken special was unbelievable. Yes order the cheese curds! Of course order a local beer!  I cant say enough good things about this place, its staff and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really good cheese curds. I had the house burger and it was amazing!!! I mean seriously soooooooo good! Cool vibe!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch two weeks ago with my in-laws who were visiting from New York. My father-in-law enjoyed his rueben and our burgers were great. The place was really crowded for a weekday and loud. The service was great...the waiter kept our water glasses full which was great because it was a hot day. My husband enjoyed the wide selection of beer. The only thing that wasn't good was my cheese curds....they were really greasy."}
{"text":"In a town where museum exhibits are dedicated to cocktail of the same name, this is clearly the bar of record, and sets a high standard for Madisonian drinking.  It lives on prime real estate on Pinckney that's of ample size, but not quite ample enough on weekends.  I live in an area blessed with both a wide beer selection and quality old fashioneds -- though not always of the Wisconsin variety. Here were fifty taps' worth of wisconsin beers, most of them crafty and unheard of out west and all ludicrously cheap.  For sampling I dove in on the $1 samples in 4-beer flights to quickly get the lay of the land.  My favorite menu items were the fried curds (no surprise I imagine; these were fresh and squeaky, with just enough batter to coat. Other establishments often went much further with the breading than needed) I liked the wedge salad -- and the Wisconsin variation that places french dressing on wedges -- but my favorite salad was the  #20(blue cheese, cherries, almonds; perfectly complementary).   For mains I stuck with sandwiches, pulled pork and later the turkey, both on the large side with the big flavor needed for alcohol offset."}
{"text":"As awesome as you can imagine. I had a hard time deciding between all the amazing restaurants in downtown and so happy I choose this place."}
{"text":"The fish fry and clam chowder are to die for.   Think of it is a old classic supper club in Upstate Wisconsin mixed in with pure urban flair."}
{"text":"The cheese curds were great but man cannot live on cheese curds alone. Not sure why this restaurant is so well rated.. The atmosphere is noisy and the food is pretty bland. Considering Madison is a food mecca I would skip Old Fashioned and venture to one of the many other culinary delight destinations Madison has to offer. That's truly all I have to say about this mediocre restaurant..."}
{"text":"Cheese Curds was at the top of my list while visiting Madison, so when I searched them out on Yelp I came across The Old Fashioned and I am glad that I did. It was so good that I had to make a second visit on my short trip to town.  I first arrived for a late lunch with another co-worker, we were promptly seated and the friendly waitress took our orders. We both ordered burgers with a side of cheese curds. For my burger, I went with The Old Fashioned House Burger which was served with hickory-smoked bacon, Cheddar, garlic sauce and a soft-cooked egg all on top of a delicious buttered and toasted roll. Everything about this burger was a hit, the egg, the cheese and garlic sauce all come together for an amazing taste. However I have to admit that the burger took a backseat to the cheese curds, which were clearly made in house. After trying the cheese curds at another place in town, I quickly realized that The Old Fashioned has the best!  I returned to The Old Fashioned again one evening after dinner at a local brew pub, the food was good however the cheese curds were lacking and I needed another fix before leaving Madison so it was back to the Old Fashioned for a side of cheese curds and a beer. There are nearly 150 Wisconsin beers available here to, so that makes a stop at The Old Fashioned a must on any visit!"}
{"text":"The name drew me in, and much like a beautiful Madison hooker, the rest kept me happy and wanting more.    There isn't many things more satisfying than a beautifully made Old Fashioned.  These guys do it right.  Each ingredient added separately and muddled with a real muddler and that all important elbow grease.  They could've easily faked it and had mixes ready to add to the alcohol but that didn't happen.  Bartenders were extremely friendly and even more knowledgeable about the drinks.  Great recommendations.  They didn't make anybody feel stupid for not knowing much about the drinks.    They have the standards made with Brandy or Whiskey, but they really shine when they put a little twist on the original.  My favorites involved that awesome Door County cherry juice.  I had 4 drinks, 2 standards, 2 kicked up versions.  All just perfect.  We only had drinks our first night, but heard good things about breakfast so we came back in the morning.  Goddamn gorgeous breakfast.  Biscuits and gravy were one of the best I've had.  Pancakes excellent.  But do yourself a favor and add on the fried potatoes to whatever you order.  Crispy and tasty as hell.  And because it's the law in Wisconsin, I had a Bloody Mary to wash down my breakfast.  They really know how to make a good Bloody.   Ambiance is tear jerker worthy.  Deep, rich, well worn woodwork.  The bar is beautiful.  The decorations and old beer advertising that adorn the barback add so much to the look.    I don't get to Madison very often, but this is gonna be my first and last stop when I do."}
{"text":"Really flavorful and super rich. The cheese curds are the best I have had in Madison so far and the burgers are on par with any other joint in town. I would definitely go back again. The only draw back as with all the restaurants on the square is parking."}
{"text":"The cheese curds here might be the best thing I've ever eaten. They're absolutely perfect and they are just far beyond words. Perfectly crispy, great batter and they just ooze with cheese. I had a burger too but that is off topic. Again, these cheese curds were perfect and I had them with a little bit of horseradish as my dipping sauce. I can honestly talk about these fried cheese ball all day long but they're making me hungry so I'll end my fried cheese rant. The service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Well that's just about the best experience anyone could ever have anywhere... ever.  As you can see from my picture, I got the No. 30 with cheese curds, and it was one of the better burgers I've ever eaten. The description of it isn't especially innovative, legendary, or \"YOU-CAN-ONLY-GET-IT-HERE\", but it tasted absolutely awesome... I don't even know what else to say. The best part about it had to be the bacon. I don't know if they smoke it themselves or where they get it from, but it was some of the most flavorful bacon I've ever had. As a side, I got the cheese curds, and I thought they were also very good. You kind of sort of can't go to Wisconsin without having cheese curds, soooo yeah. Cheese curds can sometimes be bland, but these ones are just artery clogging deliciousness. Please, don't waste your time dipping them in ketchup... they don't deserve that sacrilege.  The beer selection at The Old Fashioned is also insane with I forget how many dozens of taps, as well as an extensive bottled list. Considering I came in a little before 11am, I didn't find it very appropriate to order a beer. Of course, there were plenty of Mimosas and Bloody Mary's being ordered around the place. The prices for these seemed a little high, but it didn't stop them from being ordered at seemingly every other table. What else is there to do in Madison but drink, though? Alright, that was uncalled for.  No complaints from me... everything was perfectly good and perfect. The place was busy, but we didn't have to wait, there was a nice aesthetic, and the food came out surprisingly quickly. I haven't been to any other restaurants in Madison, but good luck in finding a place that'd be more appealing than The Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"First time visit, great food and service! I had the old fashioned burger it was excellent and so were the home made chip. I recommend checking it out!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Ordered a diet coke and the fried cheese curds with the tiger blue sauce and the garlic sauce. The soda was flat but they fixed it and have me another. The cheese curds were great. The to,get blue sauce it's a horseradish sauce with blue cheese, very good. The garlic sauce could definitely be more garlicky in my opinion. I would have liked to see more dipping sauce choices for sure...bacon flavored, maybe an avocado based sauce...etc"}
{"text":"My girlfriends brother wanted to try this restaurant he said it came highly recommended via his coach. The location is perfect pleasantly placed next to the State Building and has plenty to do around it with the amount of museums around.   As we walked it and I looked around I found the atmosphere to be very rustic and quite pleasant. I was greeted by the smells of dried/cured meats which I find super amazing. We were shown to our seats and created with water promptly which was amazing due to the heat out side. Shortly after sitting we bombarded the poor waiter with questions, being from out of area we hand an exuberant amount of the. The waiter was amazing friendly and quick to answer all the questions asked with out missing a beat. As he explains the different way of ordering food I found the beer list. This is where my jaw hit the ground. With a man like Old Fashioned I expected cocktails and variations of whiskey drinks however the craft beer list was outstanding. As I am a beer geek I was very pleased. The tap list seemed to be larger than 40 with what looked to be followed by another 40+ bottle list. Varieties were outstanding and Brewer selection was even more spectacular.   I zeroed in on the beer in which my pallet desired and shifted my eager eye balls to the food menu I was not alone as all of us were surprised by the complex flavor this short menu offered. Offering combinations of cheeses on a single grilled sandwich with bacon and red peppers (this being their grilled cheese), a burger with a soft fried egg, pulled port ok Texas toast and a few amazing sauces to accompany the most amazing cheese curds my young taste buds have ever wrestled.  All in all I as was everyone in my group today very impressed with the Old Fashioned and give a huge thumbs up and a huge thanks to the staff. Well done and bravo. Now go and enjoy this establishment now!!!"}
{"text":"Cheese Curds, Brats and Beer!!! Hell yeah and all for a very reasonable price. I don't live in Madison, so I don't know the nuances of cheese curds and brats but damn this place was good!"}
{"text":"Definitely a Madison institution, but so overrated!   The wait is always ridiculous, and you can't make reservations. They have a ton of space, so I don't get why the wait is so long (minimum wait is 1hr regardless of when you go or how small your group is). It must be a scheme to make you so hungry that you over-order and give them more money or spend your wait at the bar drinking more than you would have, also giving them more money.  Yes, they have a great beer selection, and the food is very Wisconsin. Honestly, though, the food doesn't blow me away, and I can go elsewhere for good beer without waiting forever.   The space is nice, but very loud and always crowded."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place and I'm not even a huge beer drinking fan.  The first person I thought of while I perused the beer list was my boyfriend... he loves trying new beers, especially ones that are unique to a particular state/region, and The Old Fashioned has a HUGE beer selection all from Wisconsin (as well as a full bar).  Totally impressed.  The crowd was mixed (which I like), the ambience was festive, and the decor was cool. If I am ever back in Madison, I shall return."}
{"text":"Why have I never reviewed this gem? Well, it's about time! The food is fantastic, atmosphere even better, and a mostly friendly staff.  The fried curds are the best in town. Any burger is fantastic! I'm not sure where you could go wrong other than long wait times, which is well worth it given the high-quality food and service.  My favorite in Madison by a long way!"}
{"text":"We love their burgers and salads!  Our waitress was a bit rude to begin with, then she actually apologized and said she was sorry if she was short with us because they were very busy and short-handed.  We were impressed by that.  She was a sweetheart after we talked about it.  We get that.  Fun atmosphere, too!  We'll go back (AND, we want that same waitress again as she did a phenomenal job of taking care of us).  It's a great place!"}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned boasts itself as the restaurant \"where Wisconsin is king\" - in apt description, if you ask me. Every square inch of the establishment is oozing with Midwestern charm. Incandescent lighting gently illuminates the wooden-paneled walls, highlighting tin Blatz signs and framed historic photographs. The atmosphere is both wonderfully intoxicating and oddly nostalgic. You'll swear you've been there before, even upon your very first visit."}
{"text":"Met up with an old friend from HS at The Old Fashioned on a Tuesday evening. We didn't have to wait for a table even though the place seemed pretty packed. We ordered Cheese Curds (my first time having them) and they were pretty decent. I also had the spicy burger without the bun, of course, it was great! The burger patty was cooked to perfection and the balsamic vinaigrette side salad was delicious as well.   I would definitely return ."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner on my hubby's business trip. We waited for 45 min for our seat, but it was well worth it! Mondays they have bogo free burger night, so that's what we did. Also tried both soups, he beer cheese and the creamy tomato. The beer cheese was a bit rich for our liking, but the tomato was to DIE for!!  I could have had a few extra bowls! Overall a great place. The only down side was the volume level! Very noisy and not a quiet booth to sneak off too."}
{"text":"Do you want to be surrounded by tourists whose hotel told them that this is the place for a \"real Wisconsin experience\"? Are you in the mood for a sandwich since there are startlingly few non-sandwich items on the menu? Then the Old Fashioned is just the place for you.   This is very much a beer and sandwich place. There are a grand total of THREE non-sandwich entrees on the entire menu: steak, mac n cheese, and trout. That's it. Four if you include the rotating nightly special. Everything else is sandwiches and some salads thrown in for good measure.    You can get good beer and cheese curds anywhere in this town. Sure, the sandwiches here are pretty good. But there's more to comfort food than Schlitz beer signs on the wall, and a bunch of freaking sandwiches."}
{"text":"As the 744th reviewer of this place I doubt there is much I can add. I will just say this: the old fashioneds are only $6.50! Holy cheap! Even if you upgrade to a sphere ice cube for $1.50 that's one helluva deal."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch after visiting the university. The menu immediately cozied up to me with its eight choices of old fashions and burgers.   We ordered the cheese curds as an appetizer while we perused the menu, and they set the bar high for the rest of the meal. We all agreed they were probably the best we'd ever had!  I ordered the Applejack Old Fashioned, which was probably in my top three favorite Old Fashions I've ever tried, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to that cocktail, and I'm always on the hunt for the \"best\" one.   For food, I ordered the Spicy Burger (No. 29) and added a Fried Egg on top because I couldn't decide between No. 29 and No. 30 (The House Special) and this seemed like a good compromise. It was delicious, and probably one of the juiciest burgers I've had in a long time, and not juicy in a gross way.   The only thing that let me down was the fries that came with the burger. They were pretty bland and kind of hard, without being crunchy. They weren't that great. I should've got the cheese curds as the side instead of just the fries. Although my girlfriend got the side salad and that was pretty good too.   The selection of beers should be enough for anyone to be satisfied."}
{"text":"Love going to old fashion for a drink, cheese curds, and their cookies.  I find there food to be average, but the atmosphere makes up for it...just a fun place to go to every few months."}
{"text":"This place is ok. We came here to try the cheese curds, artisanal cheese and Old Fashioned.   The cheese curds were a traditional Wisconsin sharp yellow cheddar curd fried in a beer batter. They cost $7.95 + $0.50 for the tiger bleu dipping sauce. On the upside the cheddar was really good and the dipping sauce was ok. On the downside, it was a little greasy and salty and charging for the dipping sauce was odd. All that said, they were tasty and if I were to eat here, I would order them again. The cheese plate #3 for $12.95 was good and the Old Fashioned drink $6 was ok. Its got a dive sports bar look and feel. Probably a fun college student hangout.  Listed in Drive Across America: https://www.yelp.com/collection/4_4-FCUBHEQBq43u7DXRig"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, arriving at 6:30... Had a 30 minute wait as they don't take reservations, which I was prepared for and it gave me prime opportunity to grab a brandy old fashion at the bar and people watch. First, the drink was delicious, nicely muddled with orange and cherry and was only $5.50 (yay Wisconsin). Second, the crowd is a mix of 60% groups of 40 year olds, 30% groups of young professionals and 10% college students in sweat pants.   We ordered a lazy Susan appetizer which had great variety, a cornucopia of Wisconsin delights, very reasonably priced and worth savoring. Dinner was the fried walleye, which was light and flaky, with an expert amount of breading to not over power such a delicious fish.   The waitstaff is very, very busy so don't expect to make any BFF's or hear more than the regimental specials of the day.   Overall, great place for a Friday fish fry with good friends who don't mind sharing bites and leaning in to hear the conversation."}
{"text":"The food is good for visiting relatives and out of towners. Mostly its just decent greasy spoon food with nothing horrible but also not stellar. It is a good place for drinks though as they offer a large beer selection and are right off the square."}
{"text":"Oh CHEESE CURDS, CHEESE CURDS AND CHEESE CURDS...  Wisconsin, the state known for its great cheese! You cant leave this state without cheese curds from The Old Fashioned. Its almost given that this restaurant is known for the BEST cheese curds in Madison, WI. Yes, I know there are so many other restaurants that have cheese curds on their menu but this place is probably the best you can get in Madison!  I have visited Madison twice in the last 4 months and I think I came here twice just to eat their cheese curds. Their cheese curds are very soft and it melts in your mouth perfectly! With a glass of COLD BEER of your choice, its the best way to end your day after work.  They have an extensive menu for lunch and dinner too and supposedly, their gourmet burgers are very tasty as well. I forgot which one but my boyfriend and I tried 2 different burgers and they were both very fulfilling and mouthwatering.  Customer service was superb and I really have nothing to complain about their food and service. The restaurant itself is very clean and neatly organized. Only downside about this place is parking. They do not have private parking lot so street parking or public parking is best bet.  But anyway, if you are visiting Madison and/or you love fried cheese, please come by The Old Fashioned and try their infamous Cheese Curds! There's usually a long wait for dinner but seats at the bar are available without any wait upon availability!"}
{"text":"People love this place, but every time I am dragged there I continue to wonder why.  Bar service is lukewarm.  Table service is lukewarm.  The atmosphere is honestly nothing special.  The Wisconsin beer list is fine but they always seem to be out of something on the list.  And the food is simply not that good.  I haven't had the cheese curds, but their sandwiches skimp on the meat and the bread isn't all that enjoyable.  Three stars for location and the Wisconsin character; they just don't pull it off that well."}
{"text":"Let me get this out of the way: I feel like \"not a true Madisonian\" because I only find The Old Fashioned to be good, not great. This is where a lot of people take visitors for the \"Madison\" experience but ultimately as good as they are (and they're a bit of alright) ... I can't get past the noise level.  When I go out to eat I want to be able to talk to the people I am out with. If you get into The Old Fashioned after 5pm -- you can kiss that goodbye.  The way the restaurant is arranged it can be a gauntlet navigating through it as well (my sympathies to the wait staff, who are excellent by the way).  Their food is always good, but nothing else really stands out to me. I tend to go for burgers here and so perhaps that is partially on me.  The big pro, for me, is definitely the cheese curds. The breading is my ideal for what I want cheese curd breading to be. The curds are always flavorful (as opposed to just a wad of gooey salt, or obviously from frozen which is what you experience in many places)... and for this reason alone I will probably still keep coming back once in a rarity.  When I do come back, however, it will be early enough so that I can still hear the raving of my friends about how amazing the curds are."}
{"text":"Their cheese curds, & beer cheese soup are superior! My favorite restaurant on the square. Friendly staff and quick service. The old fationed never fails to impress me and my friends."}
{"text":"food is delicious, especially the cheese curds. not sure i am a fan of the up charge for the tiger sauce. also asked the bar keep to put ESPN on, but instead he left casino royale (which was muted of course) on"}
{"text":"One of the greatest meals I've ever eaten. Excellent service and wonderful ambience. Highly recommend. We had the wedge salad, prime rib salad and cheese curds. Everything was like the best comfort food - perfectly rich and not gross, know what I mean?"}
{"text":"Good food, pretty good service. Beer special of the month is always a good bonus. Downside, they have incredible long waits and it is hard to get a table during dinner. We've walked away countless times because of the wait.  Unfortunately, we have walked more than we have been able to eat and that is a lot of missed revenue for the Old Fashioned. If you want to take an out-of-town visitor there to eat, plan ahead and eat at an off peak time or else you will be disappointed with having to wait over an hr to eat dinner."}
{"text":"This is a must have restaurant for your Madison bucket list. Easily one of my favorite places, and not just because my friend used to work here.  They have the greatest cheese curds you will ever eat. Soft but fried, they go great with the ranch or tiger sauce.   The beer selection is phenomenal. As is their seasonal infused vodka.   My personal favorite is their House Burger. I'd recommend it with blue cheese. It's quite massive, so if you are able to split it with someone or have a large appetite, it's worth it."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Madison, and the place I take all out of town guests.  It can be difficult to find parking downtown, but I suggest making a day of it and taking in a tour of the capital while you visit.  The beer cheese soup is a must try!"}
{"text":"Such a cute interior. They are very accomodating with substitutions. I got the Number 29 (which wasn't too spicy) with a side of curds and ranch (~$12.50), which was a solid deal considering the amount of curds I got was pretty significant. 3.5, rounding to 4 for value and friendliness.  Two things to remember: that 1) cheese curds can go soggy real fast, and 2) you're here for the ambiance and toppings on the burger, not the burger itself (the patty was extremely overcooked).  Protip: they do offer GF bread!"}
{"text":"Curt the bartender was amazing! Keep an eye out for his impressive juggling of all things behind the bar. Recommend the Wurst platter and the burgers!  Oh, and there is PLENTY of bar space so if you get slammed with an hour wait time, just have a great beer and a place will open up in no time."}
{"text":"I do love this place. It's the classic bar to bring out-of-towners - the perfect place to get cheese curds and an old fashioned. It can get pretty busy since this is in such a great location (right on the capitol square) so be prepared to wait if you want to get dinner. Tasty food, too!"}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a wonderful place to familiarize yourself with all things Wisconsin. Everything the Old Fashioned offers epitomizes Wisconsin inside and out. It's more than beer, cheese, and brats!!!  However, that being said, what's the best way to start a typical Wisconsin meal? Beer and cheese! The Old Fashioned offers over 100 Wisconsin beers and always have one seasonal variety for $2.50! The specialty cocktails (namely, the Old Fashioned!) are tasty. And as other Yelpers have claimed, they DO have the best fried cheese curds ever! Light batter, delicious paprika sauce. Eat them while they're hot!   The Lazy Susans are a unique way to try a number of Wisconsin foods (sausage, smoked fish, cheese, salads, pickled veggies) and serve as a great starter for a large group. As far as entrees are concerned, the fried fish is delish! The burgers are tasty. Even the vegetarian sandwich is good.   The Old Fashioned never disappoints! Great place to take out of town visitors. One thing to consider, however, is that there's almost always a wait for dinner, so get there before 6-6:30pm if you don't want to wait an hour."}
{"text":"Overrated. I had a few beers and some fries here, and sat at the bar. I would never even try to sit at a table here; the way they are arranged maximizes tables but sacrifices a good flow of people in and out. It seems crowded. They have a redonkulous variety of beers on tap, which is good. Service was mediocre. The bar staff seemed overextended and were bland--no greeting when I sat down, no smile, no \"how is everything\" at any point. My order of fries, while huge, were undercooked, bland (much like the staff), and freezer burned. No amount of mayonnaise or hot sauce could rescue them. I ended up throwing most of them away later--and I HATE wasting food. I didn't try the cheese curds... just how special can frozen cheese curds be? I will return sometime to try them and find out, but... jeez, tons of bars in Madison serve fried cheese curds. What, are they deep-fried in unicorn fat or something?   There was interesting people-watching to be had, but there was a... how shall I say... \"conservative\" vibe to the place. The TV was turned to Fox News, which did dampen my appetite a bit.  I may stop back in for a few pints and try some of those fabled curds, but I'd never make a habit of the Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"Cheese curds!!!  The other food we got was fine was well -- large portions and good quality -- but the cheese curds were the best I've ever had. Loved the tiger dipping sauces, too."}
{"text":"Our service was a little poor, he was not attentive to filling up things and our food took about half an hour after a half an hour wait to sit down. However, the atmosphere was so great, the food was amazing, that this did not bother us. The old fashions are amazing they are totally worth it and live up to the name."}
{"text":"Great location (on the square), great food, excellent beer selection, great cheese curds. If you are from out of town, you must come here - a true Madison, Wisconsin experience! Always crowded, but that is a good thing - you know it is a good place!"}
{"text":"This is honestly one of those places that I just don't get the hype. I prefer to come here for a mid-day drink like a mediocre Bloody Mary than wait in line to eat \"meh\" food in a crowded SUPER LOUD atmosphere.  Everyone in Madison seems to LOVE this place. Everyone who visits Madison loves it. I've just never had a great experience. It's always so hectic and the sheer volume of it when you walk in the door is enough to make me turn around and walk right out.  I will say that the bartenders I've had there are always cool and friendly and talkative which is a huge plus for me. Going there mid-day to have a Bloody Mary and some cheese curds was the most I've enjoyed it. Even though - be prepared for an unpopular opinion - I didn't think the cheese curds were very good. WAY too greasy and kind of gross to be honest. Going there at night with a large group to eat dinner is a very stressful experience.  I wouldn't say don't go there... but it's not my favorite spot.  Fantastic location for tourists though and a cool interior."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of loud crowded restaurants with long waits and the Old Fashioned is all of these things. But hit it at the right time and you can sidle up to the bar or grab a table and enjoy one of Madison's best burgers and a great selection of cocktails. I really never stray from burger 30 - garlic aioli, bacon, and a sunny side up egg. It's messy but delicious. Order a door county cherry old fashioned to go with it."}
{"text":"I loved going to the Old Fashioned. We went on a Friday night and of course it was packed. We were lucky to get seated right way even in a large group. Another group we were with had a little wait for their table but not terrible. However, for arriving at almost the same time we had drastically different service. They said it took over an hour to get their food and we did not have to wait that long AT ALL, about the time it took to get through a beer. I had heard they had the best deep fried cheese curds in town and after trying a couple other places I would have to agree. Someone else at our table ordered the brat plate which wasn't too bad, not mind blowing. We probably should have gone with the fish fry since it was Friday night, but I will have to save that for the next visit to Madison!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down has the best burgers. I was referred here by the hotel bar staff because their food was too fancy. I wanted a old fashion burger and I got one. I had the The Old Fashioned House Burger without the fried onions and it was so amazing that I didn't have time to snap a photo! I'm from California and hands down the best burger I have ever had. Price was great, staff was friendly, TV to watch the game and food was mouth watering. Also, their beer selection was overwhelming but a good overwhelming! Will for sure be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you're visiting Wisconsin for the first time, look no further for your education on Wisconsin culture. I brought my friend here who was visiting from the PNW, and she got a burger with a fried egg on it and some deep-friend cheese curds. Obviously, she understood Wisconsinites immediately.  Besides this, it's a good place for happy hour, dinner with family, or late night snacks."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best spot to get a good (and huge) Wisconsin meal. The Old Fashion Burger with a fried egg on top is the most popular item. BUT- the most crucial part of your order is the fried cheese curds- famous in Madison & for a very good reason.   Great place for families, friends, and all of the above."}
{"text":"OMG the cheese curds! I was driving thru Wisconsin and I'm so glad I stopped here. I had the walleye fish sandwich, hot cheese curds, and wisconsin beer. Left the place satisfied. Sat at the bar because I went alone and I didn't want to wait 30 min for table which was fine with me. the Bartenders were so nice and attentive. I well definetly stop by again."}
{"text":"The best place in Madison for all things Wisconsin! I went here whenever my friends from out of town visit Wisconsin and they want to experience America's Dairyland.   It's casual and comfortable. It's more pubsy than some restaurants. Many locals living around Downtown visit here  for drinks. They have one of the best cheese curds in Madison. Their beer selection is enormous and many of them are cheap or reasonably priced. The service can get slow at times and the wait can be long, but it's expected for one of the most popular restaurants in town. But, I would not hesitate to recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"We ate here on our first night in Madison and LOVED it!  It was really busy but it was a Friday night and we weren't in a big rush so we put our name in, walked around the capital square and they texted us when our table was ready.   We started with cheese curds and old fashioneds, definitely the best curds we had the entire trip (and we tried a few different spots!).  The ranch dipping sauce was delicious and you could tell was homemade instead of the gloopy stuff you typically find in restaurants. I'm not a huge old fashioneds gal but figured it's what they were known for so I gave it a shot.  Not bad, a little sweet but worth the try.    I got the Friday Fish Fry with perch.  It was good, but it seemed to not be battered very well, my batter kept separating from the fish but it didn't deter me too much.  The lemon caper tater sauce was great!  My husband got the brat sandwich which was really good and our friends got sandwiches as well and they were both pleased.    We liked the atmosphere, lots of memorabilia around which was cool as a visitor.  Our waitress was very nice and provided some good guidance with the menu.  We met a nice local couple next to us and they shared some tips for our football experience the next day.  Definitely a good spot when visiting Madison!"}
{"text":"First off, we had a great server who was super knowledgeable. The beer list has 50 Wisconsin brews on tap. Delicious! I got a Spotted Cow (there were so many to chose from, I'll branch out next time), a classic burger and we split an order of fried cheese curds with amazing dipping sauce.  Let's start with the fried cheese curds. They were amazing. Hot, slightly crunchy outside with a delicious cheese curd inside. We chose the ranch dipping sauce. Dang. So good. I gobbled those up (sorry, Mama) and then our burgers came.  I ordered the classic burger (which apparently Monday night special is two burgers for the price of one! Woo hoo!) which is a toasted bun with garlic spread, medium burger, aged cheddar cheese, cooked onions, pickle, lettuce, bacon and an egg over easy.   This place uses lots of local produce (no tomato on the burger, its not in season our waiter explained), has excellent food (the lady next to us got some amazing looking mac n cheese) and a pub atmosphere. They also have specials every night of the week, including the very Wisconsin, Friday Night Fish Fry."}
{"text":"Came to Madison on a business trip and Yelped this place. Ate here myself.  Restaurant is warm and cozy, compared to cold outside. Restaurant has a bar in each of the 2 main rooms, can eat at the bar. Not too noisy, dim lighting. Put in my name and gave my phone number. I was very intrigued by their texting system that lets you know when your phone number was entered into the system and when your table was ready.  I ordered the Old Fashioned House Burger with salad, and a pint of Klisch.  Klisch beer - light beer, not a strong flavor. I'll stick with my Stellas and Coronas. Old Fashioned House Burger - pretzel bun, meat cooked medium rare as I asked for, small piece of lettuce, tomato, egg! I was excited to try a burger with a sunny-side egg, and it was a perfect match. Lots of good matching tasting protein. Size of burger looks small but perfect size with sides. I would definitely try this burger if it is your first time here.  I ordered a side of salad with my burger but got fries. I let the waitress know and they brought me a side of salad. Fries - almost shoe string. Average tasting, goes well with Burger. Salad - average salad, side was more than I was expecting. I was not expecting a full side. Dressing was good. Garden salad.  Great burger! Not expensive.  Service did not live up to the restaurant's rating for food. It took 10min for the server to come to my table to order my food, and I was sitting right by the entrance to the second room. I was looking around and also saw that quite a few tables were waiting for the server to bring a check or take their orders. I had to ask for my water to be filled twice. Waitress was not engaging."}
{"text":"Throw a dart at the drink menu and you'll hit an amazing beer. Also a great place for a date. The couple sitting next to me are gazing at each other in a way very similar to how I looked at my beer-battered cheese curds"}
{"text":"This place has generally good food, and a very Wisconsin feel. It's a good place to stop for Wisconsin staples. Be warned that it is usually very busy, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Iconic restaurant delivers signature comfort food taken up a notch. Great selection of beers if the signature Old Fashioned Bloody Mary isn't in your wheelhouse. Their breakfast selection is seasonal and even fits healthy foodie requirements."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, great drinks, and the best fried perch I've ever had save for my grandma's."}
{"text":"Great food stop right across from the capital building in downtown Madison. We were told going in that the Old Fashioned was one of the 'can't miss' eateries in Madison, and we understand why!   Our appetizer was the cheese spread (No. 4 on the menu), and we were pleased for the most part. The cheese spreads change daily, according to the menu, and we did not ask what they were ahead of ordering. Did not like the horseradish spread (personal taste preference), but a great appetizer for 2-4 people. It was. Lot for the two of us.   My wife got the grilled chicken sandwich, and was pleased, aside from the surprise of horseradish once again- not as overpowering with the other elements of the sandwich. I got the Old Fashioned Burger (No. 30 I think), and as a burger lover and one who operates off of a 'when in Rome' agenda when trying new restaurants, I LOVED this burger. Smaller meat patty, but tasted great with the bacon and egg on top. Fries were simple and well seasoned.   Price was fair. Great place to stop at in downtown Madison. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"In the midst of Madison, Wisconsin lies the town favorite restaurant named The Old Fashioned. I'd never been to Wisconsin before and Yelp said to go here, so I went.  The place is buzzing and its evident that everyone comes here to eat. All food orders have to be placed at the register, so once you know what want, you walk on up to order your food and drink, which the waiter will then being to your table.   I ordered the pumpkin apple soup for an appetizer and the wood smoked chicken breast sandwich for my meal. The soup was delicious and exactly what I needed as it was friggin freezing outside. It was sweet, savory, piping hot and delicious. The chicken sandwich was just ok. I felt the chicken was over cooked, but the bacon and swiss cheese gave the sandwich a good taste that I can tell would have been delicious if the chicken wasn't overdone.  This is a cool place that's definitely worth coming to. It's located in the heart of downtown Madison and is walking distance to other sites and restaurants in the area. I can definitely see there being a wait at peak times, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"This was my first time and I had a great experience. I can't remember now what we got, but I remember everything we ordered was good. Portions were big and service was very friendly. I remember the coffee being decent too."}
{"text":"It has been years since I actually ate at the Old Fashioned. Every time I attempt to go there (usually around dinner on a Friday or Saturday evening), the wait is well over an hour and my group doesn't want to wait. I'm sure it's easier to get a table on a week night.   I did have a chance to have some drinks at the Old Fashioned one night and was reminded of how much I enjoy stopping there. They've got a pretty impressive beer selection. The evening we went they even had a 3 Sheeps beer - one of my favorite microbrews! They have a good selection of cocktails and of course, make a great old fashioned! My brandy-sour rivaled the ones my husband and I make at home.   So no worries, if your dinner plans to eat at the Old Fashioned are thwarted by a long wait, stop back after dinner for drinks!"}
{"text":"Give me an O! Give me a V! Give me an E! Ok, fine, whatever. I'm spelling overrated. This place is soooo overrated.   The food is...you guessed it...overrated. You want good cheese curds? Go to the numerous other places on the Square that have curds. For instance, Graze, Tipsy Cow or the Merchant. The curds here were in a pool of oil and not to mention small and chewy.   Also, for a place called The Old Fashioned, they don't have the best old fashioned. Service here has always been mediocre at best. When I think about the Old Fashioned I just shrug my shoulders and think meh.   I truly don't think waiting for a table here is worth the food and drinks (wait times can be up to an hour and a half). There are so many other places to go to in Madison that have similar menus with much better food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of this restaurant for several years, but after our most recent two trips there, I'm starting to think it's lost it's appeal. We were there on a Saturday night last summer and surprisingly it was not crowded. However, the service was terrible- the waitress never brought the cheese curds we ordered (we'd ordered them right away with our drinks) and then went on break after taking our order, so another server brought our entrees. I had the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing, which I have had before and really enjoyed, however this time it was terrible. The chicken was extremely dry and overcooked- inedible actually. When we finally flagged down another server to ask where our curds were, they insisted they'd already gone out to our table (um...no they didn't) and then finally brought us some, but at that point it was the end of the meal and we didn't want them anymore. I thought it was poor form that they didn't at least offer to take them off our bill.   We made another trip there today for lunch, and once again had mediocre service and food. We got stuck sitting in the main dining room, so we were freezing because of the draft from the door being constantly opened (always a problem there). As usual, the tables are really close together, so we were uncomfortably close to a couple next to us and could hear their entire conversation. Very awkward- especially since they appeared to be on a first or second date! And the worst part of the whole meal, was that THE CHEESE CURDS HAVE CHANGED! The curds were the best part of the whole restaurant! Today when they arrived they had a distinctly orange look- like the batter is totally different- and they were disgustingly greasy and heavy. We didn't even finish ours. Soooo disappointing!!!   I think it might be time for me to start looking for a new favorite restaurant :("}
{"text":"I was told that this was this was the place to go in Madison, and that the fried cheese curds and Old Fashioned burger were the two menu options that were must-order items. I would confidently repeat that advice to anybody asking.  My trio made it in here around 7 on a foul-weathered June Saturday night, and we weren't the only people who had the idea to do so. It is a pretty large place, but we had about a 45 minute wait for a table. Conveniently, the hostess can take your phone number so their system will send you a text message when your table is ready, leaving you free to wander around the other nearby establishments, hang out around the capitol building, or find a few beers at the bar. There isn't a convenient place to hang out inside if the bar area is packed, which it likely will be, so maybe hanging out somewhere different until our table was ready would have been a better option than getting a beer from the bar and constantly moving around to get out of the way for other people who were going in and out.   The place definitely has a loud and busy atmosphere, but it feels more fun than overwhelming and everybody in the place is smiling and having a good time. There aren't as many TVs inside as I would have expected, but that probably keeps it a little more of a restaurant feel than a sports bar type place. There are at least a couple TVs over the bar, and there might be more around that I didn't see, but if you wanted to watch a game here you'd need to request a table within viewing range. They did have some cool sports memorabilia on the walls, including a lot of Wisconsin focused items.   Almost right at 45 minutes after out estimated wait time was given, my phone buzzed and we were seated. Our waiter was fantastic, although he was a little hard to hear in the more-noisy-than-average setting. We got a round of beers ordered, which was made easy by their $3 pint special of a local Wisconsin brew of which the name escapes me. Aside from that special, they had a very long list of fantastic Wisconsin offerings both on tap and in the bottle, and of course they offered their namesake along with a few unique iterations of the drink. The menu is actually a little tough to read, since you are basically reading a description of each item in order to figure out what it is, but it is mostly filled with offerings of appetizers, salads, and sandwiches/burgers. They offer some charcuterie boards as appetizers that sounded delicious, but we went straight for the fried cheese curds. The smoked paprika sauce that we ordered with the curds put them over the top and made the year that I surely knocked off my lifespan for eating them well worth it.   Just as the 3 of us were starting to slow down on the cheese curds, our entrees came out and I swear the lights dimmed and my Old Fashioned Burger had rays of light emanating from it. Maybe that was just my tunnel vision focusing on the glorious burger piled high with toppings that was now in front of me. It's hard to mess up anything made with flame-grilled beef, fried onions, smoked bacon, aged cheddar, garlic sauce, and a fried egg, but they definitely made sure the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. The meat was cooked perfectly as ordered, and everything tasted like it was top quality, especially the 2 different meats between the buns. I don't think anything beats a runny yolk on top of a burger, and they nailed it. I got fries as my side instead of upgrading to one of the other offerings, and they were good but just standard fries. I would definitely recommend this burger to anyone that wasn't vegetarian, and I'd even go so far as to suggest those who are to make an exception just this one time.  We were offered a dessert menu at the end of the meal, but not one of us had any extra room for any more food. You certainly don't have to worry about leaving here hungry. When I make it back here again, I might stray from their popular burgers and instead get the mac and cheese, since I was eyeing it all night as they were constantly bringing it out to other tables It looked delicious and packed with cheese, but that will have to wait for another day. Hands down one of my favorite places I've ever been in the upscale burger and beer category of restaurant, and that is in a list that includes a lot of other places."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! The chicken and biscuits is a hearty meal that is great in February in Wisconsin. The cheese curds are a great way to start your meal! Always love taking visitors to Wisconsin to the old fashioned!"}
{"text":"Once again an outstanding performance on all levels.  Food was great, drinks even better! There seems to always be a line to get in this place, probably because it is so good and right on the square across from the Capitol.  Highly recommended! Sam is our favorite Bartender, very personable and attentive! Prices are slightly inflated but still in the ballpark."}
{"text":"This is a classic, unique Madison restaurant. Whenever a friend comes to Madison from out of town, I take them to The Old Fashioned. I always get the prime rib sandwich, and it is easily the best beef sandwich I have ever had. They also have excellent, cheap tacos on Tuesday - the tilapia tacos are my favorite. They also always have a great monthly beer special ($3 for a pint of a good, local craft beer). Lastly, they probably have the best cheese curds in Madison."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch/lunch.  Pros: -Beer is super reasonably priced -The cheese plate is good, and the sides  -The brandy (cherry?) ice cream is amazing -Brunch plates are huge, tasty -The Old Fashioned Burger is great -The bloody mary brunch special is a breakfast all to itself -Honestly, the mixed greens that come with the sandwiches are really good  Cons: -Cheese curds aren't great, and grease tends to pool at the bottom of the trays (though the garlic sauce is fantastic) -There's usually a wait, though I haven't had to wait longer than 30 minutes (weekends) and you can stand at the bar"}
{"text":"The burgers are great, as was the service.  They have a fabulous beer selection."}
{"text":"Everytime I go here I always get their Prime Rib Sandwich. I have to say its one of my favorite things on the menu. Their lazy Suzannes are excellent and a total wisconsin thing to get. Enough food for two people but also a great app for a table full of people. The cheese curds are great and will melt in your mouth. You will have to wait for a table on any night here, but there are spots at the bar and a great tap selection. I love this place every time I go."}
{"text":"Burger #205: Form follows function (or does it)  I honestly love Wisconsin. Rather, I love spending a couple days in Madison for cheese curds and pizza. On my last trip out there, I decided that I needed to try a burger and the one at the Old Fashioned looked the best.   Located plop in the middle of the capitol building square, the Old Fashioned offered up some pretty homely treats; deep fried cheese curds and tall cans of PBR. Along with both of the aforementioned, I got the house burger, medium-rare.   My grin was ear to ear when this masterpiece of burgertecture arrived; http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RJNAeNA-209sctUO0dmwuA?select=DpwRdmGx8A6mRB6MdsuwPA  The bed of golden fried cheese curds surrounded the pristine tower of beef, pork, and expelled avian egg. The monolith was not without its faults; the bacon had to be double tucked under the egg-cheese mass to ensure even distribution, and the burger patty itself lacked seasoning. But the bacon, yolk, cheese, and added cheese curds added back the missing salt.   Overall, a very tasty burger that I'd be happy to try again."}
{"text":"Had the Wisconsin burger and the eggs benedict.  Food was just \"meh\" - burger was a bit greasy no tomato option, fries were frozen not fresh cut, the eggs were alright and the potatoes were okay.  Overall food was prob a 2.5/5.  The only reason I gave it 3 overall was because of the energy and atmosphere - it was packed (why? Who knows! It's definitely not the food).  Would not come back/recommend."}
{"text":"Overrated compared to what I had heard (at least for lunch).  Food was fine, but overly fried and nothing particularly special (I would go to Weary Traveler any-day instead).  No table service for weekday lunch despite our 20 minute wait for a table.  Good beer and decent atmosphere."}
{"text":"The location of this establishment has it facing a beautiful state capital with ample parking within 2 blocks. My buddy and I came here and were absolutely delighted at the foods presentation and taste. As other views have suggested, we tried the cheese curds. WOW, best I've had in some time. The prices weren't outrageous and the staff was incredibly friendly. The bar always had plenty of people ready to get whatever we needed and did so with with a pleasant smile."}
{"text":"It has a city atmosphere - This is a fun place to go when you have some time to put in your name for a table and go have a drink at one if the two bars. Fantastic bloody mary cocktails.   I found out that i like pickled eggs!"}
{"text":"Came here Friday night for dinner but the wait was like 1.5 hours so we decided to go elsewhere.  We then came back on Saturday around 2pm for a late lunch and got a table right away.  I'll be honest, we were tailgating all morning and I was a little bit drunk.  I ended up getting their mac and cheese with their side salad.  Both were awesome! I've never ordered mac and cheese at a restaurant before and the crust on top was delicious!  We also go the cheese curds because I was told that Old Fashioned had the best in town, but honestly I thought they were a little bit too salty, the ones at Tipsy Cow were much better!"}
{"text":"No patio or food to go. Apparently you can't get food to go after 6pm? But all I wanted were some cheese curds and there was no place to put the dogs."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. The food was delicious. The wait staff was okay. Alot of people say they were great, but it's possible society standards of \"good service\" has lowered."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place with a large party at dinner time, all needing separate checks, expecting the worst and was so, so pleasantly surprised!  They've got about a million local beers on tap, and our waiter was fantastic and brought samples of beers before we committed to ordering them.  The fried cheese curds were delicious, as were both of the cheese plates that my table ordered.  I ordered one of the specials for dinner-a really delicious BLT made with local tomatoes and served with a HUGE side salad.  (I'm usually prepared to be disappointed with the size or quality of a side salad, but this one had dark leafy greens, a tangy vinaigrette, and was beautifully fresh).  Definitely worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Old Fashioned is a fun place to go for dinner or drinks.  It is usually full of folks so I don't get there a lot.  I've never had any bad experiences.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I like the food and like the drinks, very WI feel. Not a place to go when dieting. If it's just my wife and I we've had a good time.   My biggest gripe with this place is they are not kid friendly at all. We don't dine during the busy times but we felt unwelcome when we arrived with our two young kids. We actually had a server ask to switch with another server since she apparently didn't want to deal with kids. One of those experiences that make you not want to go back."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is one of those places I always forget about and then think \"man, I need to come here more often\" every time I go back. I can't recall having been disappointed in anything I have eaten here. The brunch specials are top notch.   Now, that being said, there are two things people need to do when they come here.  1. Eat the cheese curds. 2. Get an old fashioned (Brandy, Sweet..always)   Everyone else has already said, so just do it. I don't think you will regret it, and more than likely you will thank all of us for the awful stomach ache you have from eating way too many curds and drinking that 3rd old fashioned you probably didn't need."}
{"text":"As a FIB, I don't know anything of this \"happy hour\" Wisconsinites yammer on about. Apparently, showing up at bars such the Old Fashioned, in the early afternoon makes you happy for not just one, but for three solid hours. All pints are two for one and they have a great selection to choose from.  It almost seems like they have every beer brewed in Wisconsin on tap.   The atmosphere is outstanding, the staff is friendly, and they have things a fine selection of things that are pickled available to soak up some of the alcohol."}
{"text":"Madison has some amazing culinary establishments, and I think The Old Fashioned is a bit overrated and doesn't belong on that list. There are much better eats in Madison! They do have a good beer list (but it's Madison-- that's a given), and they have an extensive menu, but their food is good (not great) and the wait is always long. If you want plenty of WI themed options and beer in an excellent location, The Old Fashioned will deliver. If you want the best food Madison has to offer, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Are you from out of town? Do you not know what a cheese curd is? Then, everyone and their mom is going to recommend that you stop here to eat deep fried cheese curds and drink a brandy Old Fashioned. For what it is, it's a decent place. Right on the square, it's the perfect dining destination for those with tired legs after having toured our amazing, beautiful and rat-infested capital. Their cheese curds are good, though not the best in town.  They have nailed the Brandy Old Fashioned, the Korbel is implied (unless otherwise stated), just as it should be! Rail brandy should never be served to out of town guests. The rest of the menu is decent, though nothing really special, which is fine. It is tavern food after all. My main complaints are about the experience itself. Largely open, with tall ceilings, noise reverberates around the room developing into a very distracting cacophony. It's always busy and everyone starts yelling over each other ignored to talk to the person right next to them. I've never had a normal volume conversation here. I leave with a horse voice and a headache. Now this isn't always an unwelcome experience, but, just be prepared. If you or someone accompanying you is easily over stimulated, I strongly suggest you try eating somewhere else, or go in the summer and get a table on the patio."}
{"text":"The cheese curds were to die for. Best I've ever had! If you don't order them, you are definitely missing out. The prime rib sandwich was also great! I split it with my fiancé and they served it to is on separate plates with our own fries. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Best mac and cheese I've ever had. The cheese curds are amazing too. Good atmosphere. I always try to go here when I'm back in Madison."}
{"text":"A comfy wood-panelled establishment with good beers on tap and a diverse menu featuring foods from local dairies and farms.  And Yum!! They serve the most innovative country take on Eggs Benedict I've had, featuring an English muffin, a bratwurst patty, a perfectly cooked egg, and a delicious dijon cream sauce. Their breakfast potatoes are also wonderfully tender and seasoned with kosher salt and rosemary. Pure breakfast heaven!!  I should also mention that they offer a number of cheese and sausage plates as part of their lunch and dinner selections. Who can resist that? And cheese curds. Oh, the cheese curds."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my cousin, from out of state, to have the most typical Wisconsin meal.. Where do I take him? No other than the place with the best cheese curds!! He fell in love after his first bite. They really are the best cheese curds around."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great pub food and an incredible selection of beers. I had some spotted cow beers, macaroni and cheese and of course the famous cheese curds. I think I became lactose intolerant as a result of the meal, but it was worth it. The food is really high quality."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!!!   I must say the Cheesecurds... best cheese curds EVER.  They have a chewy cheese and a fantastic breading. Not like your normal breading either. It is absolutely delicious.  Then I had the special - a prime rib sandwich.  Thinly sliced prime rib, green and red pepper, (more) cheese, and tiger sauce. It was fantastic.   Last, we ate a yummy home-made-buttery-chocolate chip cookie. Need I say more.  This is a must stop in Madison WI!!   I'm going to say you can you can bring kids, because of the monstrous cookie, however if you plan on having an old fashioned, you may want to leave them home."}
{"text":"I rolled into Madison for the first time for a business trip and went to The Old Fashioned for dinner on my way to a hotel.    This place is awesome.   It was a boring Monday night on a wintery day and while downtown seemed pretty dead, The Old Fashioned was full of people and life.  They have 52 Wisconsin brews on tap, some of them as cheap as $2 or $3.   Did I mention that the food is awesome too?    My coworker and I ended up doing some of their beer tasting flights along with our dinner.   What a great value (compared to DC prices!)  I'll be back on my next trip for-sure."}
{"text":"I don't understand what the hype is all about. They have an extensive local beer menu, but you can get the food anywhere and the atmosphere leaves much to be desired. It is dark and crowded with slandered Wisconsin menu items - which seems to be the claim to fame. Cheese curds and sausage are on everyday Wisconsin restaurant menu"}
{"text":"The Old Fash as I refer to it, is that reliable friend that you can always count on. Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner, I'm never disappointed. My biggest problem when I eat here is I always want to order everything off the menu because I'm starving and it's all oh so good. The cheese curds are a must order and you get your choice of dipping sauces. Where you go from there is up to you, but you'll surely enjoy whichever it is you choose.   This is not only a great meal place, but also somewhere to stop in for drinks or appetizers. I've always had great service here whether it's sitting at a table or at the bar.  It's pretty typical for the Old Fashioned to be busy. It's in a prime location, popular with both locals and visitors to the city. But, if you have to wait it's worth it. As always, my recommendation if you can is to grab a seat at the bar if it's a long wait. But, those spots can be full as well.  If you're going for lunch, during the week they don't serve to the tables and you do need to go up to the bar to order. Just as heads up so you're not waiting at a table. It's quick and efficient. If eating here in the middle of winter and sitting by the front doors, you may need to keep your coat on as it stays pretty chilly with people coming in and out. :)  My only not so favorite thing here are the Tuesday Taco Nights. I'm just more of a fan of the regular menu, but it's a great deal that they offer if you want to go out for cheap tacos.   And, I wouldn't steer you wrong with their Bloody Mary. Fully loaded with a huge piece of beef jerky, cheese curds, a pickle and a pickled egg. As a local, I can say this place lives up to the hype and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ok. Super good Wisconsin fair here. 150 local brews and great local food. Try the Gorgonzola salad with grilled salmon, the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon, or why grass feed beer burger. Best here. Add some Wisconsin fried cheese curds and we're in business!p"}
{"text":"Great selection of Wisconsin fare: brats, walleye and of course deep fried cheese curds. The food is solid and on this visit the service was lighting fast. When in town visiting relatives we often stop here and this time we got a table with no wait - a first! OF is super popular and waits can be very long on weekends especially football Saturdays. But not so at 5pm on a Tuesday. The beer choices of mostly Wisconsin beers is extensive.  A favorite stop of ours in Madison!"}
{"text":"Lots of bars have massive beer lists these days.  But how many of them have massive beer lists that only contain beers from their home state?    That's what I loved about this place--pro-Wisconsin through and through.  Unhealthy, cheese and sausage-laden plates are everywhere.  Nice bartenders at a huge bar.  And a separate \"build your own old-fashioned\" menu that has everything you need to customize your drink.  My only complaint?  it seems to be torn between a gastropub and a family-friendly alehouse.  A lot of children were in the place, making noise, getting things sticky, and generally making me feel less inclined to shout profanity-laden things at the television sets.   On second thought, that's probably a good thing."}
{"text":"I'm heading home to Madison for the holidays and this will be my first stop.  I can't wait to get some hot cheese in my mouth and follow it with the seasonal Cherry Bounce beverage.  The cheese curds are natural cheese curds, breaded and fried.  Not the stabilizer laden nuggets you find elsewhere.  I love the burger/egg combo but mostly go for the nightly specials.  You can't beat Taco Tuesdays, unless of course you are Barbecue Pork Thursdays. There is usually a wait on weekends, but if you can't enjoy yourself having a drink at the bar then you are boring.   Oh, and I should mention that the tall, good looking guy running the place most nights is my brother.  He's single, ladies."}
{"text":"Definitely go here when in Madison!!  Excellent service, great and tasty food, and superb atmosphere!"}
{"text":"A friend told me that this place had the best fried cheese curds in wisconsin, and he was pretty darn close. This things were by far the best I have had to date. I also had the summer sausage sandwich which I also thought was fantastic. This is a great casual dinning restaurant right in view of the capitol building. Fantastic place!"}
{"text":"Nick was great. Knowledgeable and happy to give suggestions to someone from out of town. Fantastic curds, good burger (#30), and nice people, great place for someone in Madison just for a night on business."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants to eat at downtown. I swear they have a wait during all operational hours here and that's because its worth it. Cheese Curds. Beer cheese soup with popcorn topping. Tap beers. You'll want to eat more and more, but the portions will fill you up before you can. The staff are also all amazing here and dilligent with remembering details on your order. Plus prices are fair and the atmosphere makes you feel like a local even if your not. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"OMG this place is AWESOME! We had fried cheese curds and fried onion rings as an appetizer then the walleye sandwich which was most excellent!"}
{"text":"Visited the first time and enjoyed it very much.  Great atmosphere and food.  No one spending more time with cell phone than friends. Excellent service too!"}
{"text":"We stopped from out of town, since this place had good reviews.  nice bar with some good unique food choices.  I got a blt which was great.  They do over salt the fries.   And for some reason, the booth by the window had a gathering of flies. So you eat and swatted at your food the whole time. They must like to keep the back door open in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place seriously annoys me. I've come here several times but was coerced every time. It is TINY, crowded, loud, stuffy and most importantly, overrated. There is an average of 1.5 hrs waiting time anytime in the afternoon on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Of course, you cannot make reservations at this hot hip place. Pssssccch. Every person from Epic loved this trying-too-hard shack and in turn, recommended it to all their out of town friends.   The cheese curds here aren't even the best in Madison! If you like greasy, soft, waxy pieces of cheese, then maybe you'll dig these. I much prefer the Great Dane's version of the perfectly crunchy, slightly sweet, well-portioned cheese curds. If you finally get seated and order food here, then you're super lucky. I would say the sandwiches here and entrees are average to above average. The grease is definitely on Snape's hair level if you know what I mean and the decor is what I would simply call as random Americana. Applebee's and chili's does a similar flair.   Prices are like $12-$16 for a sandwich and drinks are abundant in selection but pricey. I can't seem to convince the college age and young professional crowd to seek somewhere else but hopefully someone will read this review and avoid a 2-hr wait for mediocre food."}
{"text":"A Madison staple, and a fantastic place to bring people from out of town. The staff is very accommodating of groups. Old Fashioned cheese curds are as good as it gets, they are so perfectly done. Anything you point to on the menu will most likely be satisfying and delicious. I've had all of the available sides, and they are all fantastic. Given the menu options, I have never had a salad here, so I have nothing to contribute in the vegetable department. On the other hand, the mac and cheese (with or without bologna) is a beautiful thing, and the burgers are wonderful as well. I've said all of this, and haven't even mentioned the tap list! I'll keep it short and sweet - the selection WILL NOT disappoint!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Old Fashioned. It is one of my favorite spots for lunch in Madison. The pork sandwich, mac and cheese and hot bacon salad dressing are my favorites.  As a bar, it's not my fav but only because it is a bit of an older crowd. The atmosphere as a restaurant though is very nice: cute decor, quieter, and dim lighting... great date spot.   The staff is very helpful and professional. No complaints here."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my food - the curds were good, although maybe not \"the best\" in Madison and very comparable to Capital Tap Haus's in my opinion. My Old Fashioned Burger was huge and delicious, and the onion strings I ordered as my side were pretty addicting. I was not very impressed with the service or atmosphere. The host staff will not seat you if your entire party is not present... which normally does not bother me. But they have no waiting area or empty seats, so if you are the first to arrive, you are forced to stand awkwardly and in the way of front door traffic by dining patrons until your party arrives. Once my party arrived and we were seated, our table was right by the front door, so I kept my coat on for most of dinner because of the draft. Overall, I would recommend several other similar restaurants before I would recommend this to a friend or visitor."}
{"text":"Tried this place by recommendation.   For being right on the square, prices were great also.  I had the The Old Fashioned House Burger and wife had the Friday special (Beer-battered cod).  I can say I was not disappointed.   Food was awesome !!!   And lets not forget the drinks....Their Old Fashion drinks are out of this world.  Service was great also.  Staff puts an effort to make sure everything is per the customer's desires."}
{"text":"Seems like the food and drinks never disappoint me! They also have a huge list of beer selection.  The must try is their cheese curds and old fashioned burger. Fish fry is good as well. Make potato chips as your side. They impressed me a lot. And I also like the brandy slush very much!  The only thing is that they usually have a long wait line during dinner hours. But the food and atmosphere is totally worth it :)"}
{"text":"This place is so popular and I'm not sure why. It is crowded and loud and the food is bar food. Hamburgers and fries. What's the big deal? I walked in here several times to give it a chance and quickly walked out because of the noise level. Then a friend made me meet there. It will be the last time I ever go. There are so many better places to eat in the area. And if you want bar food ... go almost anywhere in Wisconsin and get a better experience."}
{"text":"Great food and a great atmosphere. The Cheese Curds are definitely the highlight, so I would definitely recommend saving some room for some deep fried goodness. The Fish Fry is one of my favorites in Madison as well. One possible concern is make sure you leave enough time if you are trying to eat here, especially on the weekend, I have had to wait over 2 hours to get a table here on a Saturday home game day."}
{"text":"Very crowded and somehwat loud but the service was quite friendly and efficient. We've only tried the sandwiches and salads there and they were exquisitely prepared. Very West Coast, not too much food but high on quality and superior in taste. Ice cream was above average. A good stand-by for brunch."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for traditional Midwestern fare, you're coming to the right place. The draft selection is extensive and features many different Wisconsin breweries.   To go with your quintessential Wisconsin beer you MUST get the cheese curds. I recommend paring those golden, perfectly fried curds with tiger sauce, smoked paprika or even the garlic aioli. You really can't go wrong.   I've also tried their Mac and cheese, chili, beer cheese soup, and spicy burger.   Trust The old fashioned. They know what they're doing. If there's a long wait, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"When you're in Madison you have to stop at The Old Fashion. Just know it's always crowded, they don't have a great bar space to wait either. However, put your name in and they will call or text when you when your table is ready. We like to walk the square or stop at another spot for a pre dinner drink.   Food is good. However, of the times that we have been there it is not always consistent. My spicy burger was cooked medium well instead of medium. Not a huge deal as it was still good.   The old fashions are of course top notch and a must when visiting Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. Soooo delicious! I'm visiting Madison and went here on my hotel's rec, and I truly couldn't be more pleased! Amazing on all fronts.   The  wait was a bit long, but I was able to find a place at the bar and was served promptly. Terrific beer selection! It's October so I opted for a pumpkin ale, but they had tons of craft and local beers on tap so I might go back and get a flight to sample more.   I ordered the house burger and cheese curds (OBVIOUSLY, when in Wisconsin...) and I cannot even explain how  de-freaking-licious it all was! I'm originally from Iowa so I know some good burgers and cheese when I see them, but this was totally out of the park. The cheese curds were heavenly and the local beef burger (complete with bacon, aged cheddar, and egg) sooo hit the spot.   Major added perk: this is the Midwest. And the Midwest is a magical place where people are just nice. Really, truly nice. The staff was so friendly, but in that amazing way where they don't even know they're being so friendly because it's so genuine. AND it's the Midwest which means a top notch meal is actually affordable! I left totally stuffed and felt that the price was more than reasonable.   Seriously cannot say enough good things about this place. Loved the supper club roots, stellar menu, overall awesome vibe. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Oh, The Old Fashioned, you are one of my favorites in Madison!   I've had my fair share of visits, and I've been sure to try different menu items each time I go (and I've still got items on my must-try list!):   Drinks:  - The Classic Old Fashioned: the best. Can't go wrong with this -- although I like mine to be made as a brandy sour rather than the usual brandy sweet  Dinner: - No. 20 - Plump Door County cherries, Buttermilk Blue cheese and toasted almonds tossed with mixed greens and brandy vinaigrette: I added chicken to mine to make this a more filling meal and I loved it! Wasn't too heavy, the dressing was great, and they definitely don't skimp on the cherries or almonds. Overall a simple but lovely salad, in my opinion - No. 23 - Grill-seared Norwegian salmon with Bavaria's hickory-smoked bacon, cucumber, shaved red onion, deviled egg, mixed greens and tarragon vinaigrette: okay I LOVE this salad! It's so good. Has a lot of great flavors, and definitely a smokey taste with the bacon in there. It's delicious. Would probably choose this over the cherry salad if I had to! - No. 27 - Prime Rib Sandwich - Hot, shaved prime rib, sauteed with mushrooms, onions, red peppers and topped with provolone cheese, tiger sauce & pickles on Clasen's Bakery sesame seed roll: Also good. Asked for the pickles on the side, and overall I liked it! It was pretty messy though. A lot of liquid seeped through to the bottom of the sandwich, making the bottom half of the roll very soggy. The beef was so tender though!  - No. 30 - The Old Fashioned House Burger-grilled over a live fire and topped with fried onions, Bavaria's hickory-smoked bacon, aged Cheddar, garlic sauce and a soft-cooked egg on a buttered and toasted roll: THE BEST! Man oh man this burger was the first burger I've ever had with an egg on it and it changed my life. Would not recommend for a first date though. It's fairly messy to eat and you need about ten napkins to keep your hands clean, if you're constantly picking up and setting down the burger between bites! I mean you definitely can hold it the whole time too... but your burger might be gone within a minutes because it's that good. I loved it, as you can tell. For sure get this when you're comfortable enough with your eating partner(s) to be a bit messy and egg-yolky :) - No. 33 - Shaved hickory-smoked turkey breast with tiger sauce, Provolone cheese and leaf lettuce on country bread: I really liked this sandwich! It was a lot bigger than I had expected it to be -- I was extremely full after eating the whole thing, and I definitely could have gone with saving half to go. It's got good flavor with the tiger sauce, and the country bread is toasted and soft and wonderful!  Brunch: - No. 1 - Wisconsin Benedict - A toasted Wolfermann's English Muffin with your choice of a Miesfeld Market bratwurst patty or grilled market vegetables. Topped with a sunny side up egg, whole grain mustard cream and rosemary potatoes: YUM!! I had just a single of this benedict and opted for the bratwurst patty. Wow it was deeeeelicious. I loved every bite! The single serving definitely filled me up, with the help of the rosemary potatoes. Those are so good!    Bottom line is that you won't be disappointed here. I'm excited to come here and try more brunch options, as well as have a go at my favorite salad and burger again! Much love to the Old Fashioned :)"}
{"text":"I have been here several times but this last time the food was just so so. I got the pulled pork sandwich and you could tell the pork was not fresh. There are several good restaurants in Madison, I won't be going here anymore."}
{"text":"Great burgers, good beers. Tends to get little crowded and loud, but good food at a good price."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is one of my favorite places to eat and drink in Madison. I even took my fiancée here the night I proposed to her. The food is good, the drinks are good. There's a reason it's one of my go-tos in Madison. Two things bring it down for me and I'd give it a 4.5 if I could. Those things are that it's usually pretty noisy and they don't take reservations so on busy nights it's nothing to wait for an hour."}
{"text":"Any time we have family come in from out of town this is where we go. We have never had anything we didn't like. I've had the Spicy Burger, Tuna Salad Sandwich, and the Beer Battered Walleye and all are amazing! The walleye sandwich is my husband's favorite and he gets it every time. The fries and chips are both good for sides and of course you have to get an appetizer of cheese curds with the paprika dipping sauce. Be aware that you will likely need to wait, they do not take reservations however when you put your name on the list they take your phone number so you can get a text when your table is ready so if the weather is nice you can enjoy the capital square. Don't forget to order an old fashioned while waiting or with your food. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We hit The Old Fashioned for lunch a few days ago.  Quite lovely, over-all.  We were seated promptly (this is a big deal to me) and greeted in a timely fashion (also important).  Not sure if this is a normal occurrence but we had to go to the counter to order and pay for our food rather than have the order taken at the table.  Not a big deal - it was quick and painless.  I had the #23 salad, which had a nicely-cooked piece of salmon complete with a smidge of crispy skin, which I love.  The deviled egg was tasty, though I wish it had been more than half an egg.  Also quite liked the tarragon vinaigrette that it came with.  The husband had the #30, which comes with a fried egg on top.  This is becoming more and more of a common occurrence, at least in the Chicago area - I was a little surprised to see that it wasn't fried within an inch of it's life like most places we go to, and a nice runny yolk.  The cheese curds were yummy, too - I didn't try the sauce but I have the tiger sauce on my list to try the next time we are in town because, well, who wouldn't want to eat something called tiger sauce?  Refills were quick and we got the right amount of attention from servers.  Also, they stop serving breakfast right at 11 so if you are even 2 minutes late, you must select from the lunch menu.  Some places have overlap but not here, which I don't view as an issue.  Overall, very good stuff!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for breakfast - they have several types of amazing bloody Mary's; excellent cheese curds; yummy mini doughnuts and really good wall eye and eggs! Service is excellent - so accommodating.  We walked by late night and it was packed so must be good in the evening as well."}
{"text":"Like the hundreds of reviews before me, this place is awesome. And there's very little to add that hasn't already been said. But I'll try to add something new.  Location:  Right on the square. It's perfect for people watching and very near parking. They have recently expanded, from what I was told, so there's more room and less waiting.   Happy Hour!!: from 3-5pm nightly all Beers are half off! And with most being around $4/pint (reg price) that's pretty sweet. Their beer list is also pretty expansive.   Food: Cheese Curds are out of this world yummy. They aren't heavily coated or fried. Burgers, Brats, Pulled Pork...I don't think there's a bad thing on the menu.   Service: Attentive, friendly, prompt. No complaints whatsoever!   One last thing...this place has a fantastic smell. It's that wood burning oven, smoky, brewhouse, with a hint of cheese curd kind of smell. It's amazing. I wish they could bottle it for men as a cologne."}
{"text":"I am absolutely enamored with this place. Awesome Wisconsin-centric everything. At the time of my last visit the only non Wisconsin beer on the menu was Grain Belt Premium from Minneapolis, and it was listed in the \"Import\" section. Incredible. The Old Fashioned is the perfect place for breakfast on Saturday morning before a Badgers football game, and your grandpa will be proud if you order the walleye and eggs. Great location, great food and drinks and the service has always been fantastic. It's not exactly a road trip, but I have made weekend trips to Madison just for breakfast at the Old Fashioned. It's that good."}
{"text":"Hello Wisconsin!   Things I love most about Wisconsin: 1. Affordable craft beer 2. Cheese curds 3. Reasonably priced food 4. Low tax  The Old Fashioned is applicable to all of the above. Driving back from Minnesota, we decided to pit stop in Madison to check out the capital building. After snapping a few pics and walking around the area, we stumbled on The Old Fashioned (literally a stone's throw away from the capital building). After glancing over the menu from the front door and seeing the prices, we immediately made our way in to grab a bite before hitting the road again.   I did the walleye fish sandwich with the wedge salad topped with french dressing and delicious Wisconsin blue cheese! The sandwich was more like two sandwiches and the wedge salad was literally a slice of wedge lettuce... Talk about generosity! Never had walleye sandwich before, but essentially it was a beer battered fish that was deep fried and served on a buttered toast with a side of tartar sauce. Think of like a handheld fish n chips minus the chips as I had opted for the wedge salad. Delicious!  I took a bite of the fiance's prime rib sandwich which was equally delicious and snagged a few of her side of cheese curds (couldn't live WI without having some, am I right?). All and all, a great meal and really friendly staff as well. Just a great experience overall. Did I mention their draft list is $5 per pint? Um.. Hello!  Anyways, $38 for two giant meals and 2 beers off tap? I'll take that any day of the week.  'Til next time, cheers!"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and, being my first trip to Madison (and to Wisconsin) I was on a mission to eat like the locals during my one night there: beer and cheese curds for me!  The cheese curds here were awesome-- definitely the best I have had. They are available with several different dipping sauces. I chose the smoke paprika aioli and it was delicious.  Coming from Chicago, I was so shocked at the prices here-- a craft beer, cheese curd appetizer, and a very large salad came out to be less than $20... they have a HUGE beer selection and most were priced at $3-$5. Sign me up!  Service here is friendly, the atmosphere is fun, and a great location downtown with a view of the capitol building. I'll certainly pop in on my next visit to Madison!"}
{"text":"For the past couple of times, there's always been a long wait at the Old Fashioned, so immediately after work before it's even 5PM, we decided to stop by and sure enough, there was no line! However, it was a cold day, and the seats by the entrance gets a drift of cold air every time someone opens the door.  Since it was Friday, I decided to get the Friday fish fry special and got the combo. We also shared an appetizer of cheese curds, which were very airy tasting, delicious in its own way but different from other types of cheese curds that we've tried. the cheese curd tasted light and shall I dare say healthy tasting in essence even in combination with the spicy spinach dip.   We also got eight 3-oz tasting beer which was presented on a delightful Wisconsin wooden plate with the number of the beer on a round paper underneath each glass. Unfortunately, eight tiny glasses was too much to try, I'd recommend just trying four next time just for the experience."}
{"text":"I feel weird reviewing this place as a pescatarian, as it is clearly catering to the meat eater. I would give this a 2 star for people who share my dietary restrictions, but all my meat-eating friends seem to think it is very good, so I'm averaging it out. The cheese curds are good, the cocktails are WAY too sweet, and the tap list is solid."}
{"text":"Had tommys porter from Lake Louie brewing and Fatty Bombalatee from Furthermore brewery , both great beers. Delicious beer cheese soup and as always, great size salads with local cranberries and cheese. Very reasonably priced place to eat great local food.   My only wish to improve is this: With so many beer options they offer, why not have a few more rare & limited one-off beers on tap?"}
{"text":"Google walleye sandwich and this is the place that tops the results. I'm not a walleye sandwich expert, but if there's a better one than this, I want to eat it. Good bread grilled only on one side, so the inside of the sandwich soaks up the tartar sauce and coleslaw. I ordered it with the wedge salad with lovely stinky blue cheese. I'm not really sure what their lunch ordering system is all about - it just seemed like an attempt to be extra quirky."}
{"text":"Cheese curds!! This is our favorite spot when visiting Madison. The cheese curds are the best. They lightly bread them so you still get a bit of the squeak from the cheese. The burgers are always decadent and they have the greatest brandy old fashions.   Last time we were in we sat at the bar and had a great conversation with the bar keep. Even though it was pretty busy, he kept coming back to check on us and we felt very welcome even though we were just getting drinks and an app. I also love the lighting and long bar. Hands down one of my very favorite places to visit in WIsco."}
{"text":"Best burger, cheese curds and pint! Try the #30 burger (Old Fashioned Burger with crispy thick bacon, grilled onions, cheese, and a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg that gives up the ghost as you press the top bun down onto the burger-yum!).  The onion strings are also delicious.  Their French fries are crisp yet soft inside, much like a McDonalds fry.   Situated across the street from the Capitol, busy and bustling, yet welcoming and friendly. Give it a try!  For non-burger wishes, try their grilled chicken sandwich or pulled pork. I also noticed vegetarian options on the menu that looked appealing.  New favorite!"}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a great bar close to the Capitol in Madison. I've gone two times, most recently in October.  The place has a great atmosphere with two large rooms and a great bar area. The first time I went, it was late and was packed. We were lucky to get a table after about 20 minutes. Last time, it was earlier and wasn't quite as busy. It's a casual atmosphere but also nice enough for a date night.   I love this place mainly because of the extensive beer list. They have about 50 beers on tap, all from Wisconsin. I did a flight of four beers so I could try a variety. They were all good. The cocktail list looks really good as well but I'm such a fan of beer that I haven't tried any of them.  I've never had a full meal here but the snacks I've tried are amazing. The first time I went I had the cheese curds which you can't go wrong with. They were fluffy and delicious. On my recent visit, I had a cheese plate. I'm a big fan of cheese plates and this one was great with lots of nice garnishes like nuts and spreads that complimented the cheese really well.  If I lived in Madison, I'm sure I would frequent this place. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Cheese curds and Spotted Cow. Welcome to Wisconsin! I love comfort food, and this place hits the spot! Excellent beer specials!"}
{"text":"I've died and gone to a Wisconsin paradise.....  Over 20 local beers on tap, a plethora of local cheeses, a menu that makes Al's Deli envious and right on Capitol Square.  This place is awesome.  If you want to get a real WI feel and experience you have to go here.  Mac and Cheese with ring bologna!  You know a place is great when they have Spotted Cow on tap and you don't choose it because there are so many other amazing choices!  Go here now....."}
{"text":"The onion rings were awesome the no. 37 was horrible bread was way to buttery and there was way to much of the Dijon mustard mix sauce that came with it. It just overwhelmed the flavor of the chicken. The salad with the bourbon vinaigrette was excellent tho."}
{"text":"I ventured to The Old Fashioned a few weeks ago for dinner after the Badgers game, the place was hopping and I found a seat at the bar to get a beverage. The beer of the month when I came was the Oktoberfest from New Glarus and for only 2.25 a steal.  I also ordered the infamous cheese curds and thought they were a bit small, not the best I have had in Wisconsin.    For dinner I had a brat sandwich, it was good, but not mind blowing.   Service was good.   I will be back to try an Old Fashioned at The Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"Good food (perch fish fry and a wedge salad) and great service. The wedge was presented beautifully with French dressing (never seen it served with French) and the fish fry had a very light batter (pretty good). The thing that resonated most was the service, everyone knew the beers and the menu items flawlessly. Thanks for playing host to an out of towner."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was pretty disappointed by the food here. The only thing that saved this place from getting 2 stars were the cheese curds and salad. Delicious. The cheese curds came out hot and fresh. I was surprised that the batter wasn't crispy but the cheese itself was so delicious it made up for the lack of crispiness. The beet salad was also another great dish. The beets themselves were pickled which added a new dimension of flavor to the dish.  Also tried the prime rib sandwich with warm potato chips, and the Sheboygan brat with fries. Both were disappointing and had absolutely no flavor."}
{"text":"Simple, rustic decor, relaxed and easy atmosphere, great service. It's all about that smoked paprika sauce.  Still, I'd give it a 3 based on \"just decent overall\"- but the sweet bourbon Old Fashioned was Absolute Vintage Perfection. Could not have been better. I'm a sucker for a rustic cocktail in a place with wooden floors."}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet and eat. We where there on a Monday afternoon and it was packed. Don't miss any one of the lazy Susan's on the menu. My husband and I should have stopped there and had just that for dinner. Unfortunately we ordered the hamburger special and it was very dry and I didn't eat mine."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!  Came back to Madison for Wisconsin fare, and that's exactly what I got.   Started the night off with well, an old fashioned; Wisconsin-style with Korbel. That's the way my parents drink em', so I thought I'd give the old stand by a try. It was most delicious! The drink was made well--very sweet and with real fruit. Yum!  Moved on to some local delicacies--a pickled turkey gizzard (not worth the chewing), and a PBR with a spicy pickled egg in it. They served that to me in a chalace, it was pretty wonderful and disgusting. Their local beer selection was excellent. We tried some local porters and IPAs. It was good they were representing Wi  The food was great! We had the deep fried cheese curds and onion stacks for apps. Then we shared the potato leek soup (soup of the day) and the trout. Both were very delicious.   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"A Madison classic. If you're visiting, this should be atop your list - great Wisconsin cuisine!"}
{"text":"The food is very wonderful! By far the best cheese curds in Madison! They even serve food well into the evening (i work in a restaurant and it's often hard to find a place to eat after ten)The only warning would be that if you go there on a Friday or Saturday night after ten o'clock, the server can be very very slow. But during normal hours, the service is very attentive! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Lucked out and got a window seat on a Monday evening. That definitely helped make this experience better. Jacob was very attentive and checked on me often. The cheese curds too salty for me but definitely worth a try and split among friends as I barely put a dent in the basket of gooey goodness. It is a mild cheddar kind and it would go well with a tangy salad dressing. And the fish! The chef deboned this like a boss and the taste was flavorful.  I would come back but probably if I could get a window seat away from the bar crowd or if I was planning having a drink."}
{"text":"Good prices Good food Nice drink list Fun ambiance Only con: no reservations"}
{"text":"At first, I really didn't understand all the hype over this place. Do they have posh old fashioneds in every variety? Yes. Is their food just so-so? Also yes. Then I went to brunch, and boy did they redeem themselves.  The salad with Door County cherries was pretty baller but the beer cheese soup tasted funny; I was pretty sure I would like it, but it had a bitter taste to it. Also, the cheese curds tasted pretty standard; yes, they were good, but no better than State St Brats or Great Dane.  And then we went to brunch.  The highlight of brunch was the seasonal jams they offer with almost every breakfast entree. I got the mushroom and chevre omelet, potatoes, toast, and ground cherry jam. I could probably have eaten an entire meal simply with the toast and selection of different jams; they were that delicious.  Overall, it's worth checking out if simply to check it off your list as \"the place to go\" in Madison. But don't be surprised if your dinner is traditional Wisconsin fare that you've had at other restaurants around the capitol."}
{"text":"I came in for a late lunch on a football Sunday afternoon. While, the bar tender didn't know the brews well, there was a great taste sheet to help with choosing from the huge selection of craft brews on tap. The menu was simple and I enjoyed my pork sandwich. Last summer I walked in on an epic karaoke session. It's a beautiful space."}
{"text":"I loved the cheese platter, it was so amazing. I got the burger and it was very good, however I think it was just like any other burger I had. Service was decent but it was so busy that it was hard to get the waitress to come give us more water etc.  I would go again but not during busy periods."}
{"text":"Amazing food and really good drinks. I love going here for a meal or even just to hang at the bar, especially when the bartender does fun tricks!"}
{"text":"For someone trying to get into shape the old fashioned isn't the place to be.... scrap that Wisconsin and Chicago... or really the United States isn't the place to be! Darn this country and it's delicious food!!  As usual going to a new city as an Aussie with a local entering the old fashioned was the same... have you had cheese curds before? Oh you've never had cheese curds?? Well we HAVE to get cheese curds, Wisconsin's the dairy capital and this place is famous for them!! What are they I ask... well essentially they are balls of cheese scooped off the top of the cheese making process and battered and deep fried....well  what can I say... when in rome!! (All my brain could do was plead with my body to say that this would help my body stay warm during the winter months!!). Gotta say they are pretty darn good. The cheesy was striggy and the fried tasted pretty good (almost like fried chicken fried... which is a complement coming from a fried chicken aholic)  Then I was informed the burgers are famous her as well. As someone who has recently become intolerant to gluten I have to pick my battles and burgers are not usually my favorite choice of food to warrant being sick after (unlike fried chicken... I'll battle through to be able to eat amazing fried goodness). I have found a surprisingly small number of places that have gluten free burgers in Chicago and was happy to see that they had gluten fee buns here so I thought I should take the opportunity to have a burger as I haven't had one in so long. I got the spicy burger and the bun looked exactly like my friends non gluten free bun which was a good sign (usually they are smashed and thinner and soggier). The bun was good and the burger was great... it had jalapenos, pickles, onions and a spicy sauce). Mmm mmm and I couldn't even finish everything and I am usually a clean plate club member!  Only reason this place didn't get 5 stars was the service was a little off... firstly we got the window seat so was a bit chilly (but we got a great view of the amazing capitol building!), then they forgot to get us our drinks and finally a mishap with the bill splitting. Not big issues but not 5 star service."}
{"text":"Stopped in after shopping with a few friends and tried one of their Brandy Old Fashion sweet.  I have to say that was the best drink I have ever had!   Hey are the king when it comes to making this drink!  Their menu actually consisted of many versions of this drink.  Bartenders were fun!  A must place to stop in while in Madison!  They serve food their as well!"}
{"text":"I only stopped by for bloody marys and mini donuts, but oh boy.   It was the best damn bloody mary that has ever graced my lips. You can choose the vodka, and no I don't mean Smirnoff or SKYY. The Old Fashioned hosts about eight different varieties of vodkas infused with different peppers and flavors. A few that I remember are Serrano Pepper, Poblano Pepper, Dill, and Garlic. My bloody was garnished with a pickled egg, cheese curds, a giant piece of beef jerky, and a pickle.   We enjoyed them with mini donuts, and It was an outstanding mini brunch. I'd like to return to try more of the brunch items or even dinner. It was a very convenient location after shopping at the Farmer's Market all morning."}
{"text":"The first cool day in Madison all summer and it was hot and uncomfortable in the Old Fashioned. Made me kinda sick to my stomach it was so stuffy----before I even ate. Honestly, at least 3 flies bothered our table the whole time we sat inside. Very loud and annoying w/ brick and tin ceiling and not that full of people. $27.00 for a very average, full of fat Ribeye steak with lame french fries (not a real potato choice). I had the vibes like they think they are really great there......I believe it was in the beginning when it first opened. Like many other places with great success, they are greedy to make more money and charge large prices for food that is not as good as it was when they first opened. Best part of the meal was the Paprika sauce for the chees curds. Won't be going back to a \"fake\" Wisconsin supperclub. Owner needs to step back and cared like they used to."}
{"text":"Despite the namesake I wasn't crazy about the WI style Old Fashioned I tried. The cheese curds are delicious - some of the best I've had in the state for sure. This is a solid place to get good bar style food and drinks."}
{"text":"The bartenders are super nice. And the brandy slushy is top notch. Come here for fun and good drinks!"}
{"text":"This is my fail-safe, go-to restaurant for out-of-state visitors looking for an authentic dairyland gustatory experience. The cheese curds are the best in town, that I've found thus far, and the beer list is over flowing with great Wisconsin micro and craft brews.  The lunch service is a little awkward (the servers only get you drinks, you have to get up and order food from the bar). But I still love the place.  It's good for *well-behaved* kids, but let it be known that the Old Fashioned is *not* TGI Friday's.  Point of clarification; they do NOT take reservations, regardless of the \"votes\" indicating otherwise."}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about the Old Fashioned, so myself and my human decided to give it a try.  Since it was Friday and very busy, we took a seat at the bar and ordered drinks. I had a cherry mead, and it was FANTASTIC! Absolutely amazing. We were starving at that point, and we spotted a case of giant cookies behind the bar. So, being the trash pandas that we are, we asked for one. We found out that they are only a dollar and they are amazing. crispy on the edges, chewy and delicious.  We got a table pretty quickly and ordered cheese curds and onion strings. They were amazing. We tried the ranch and the smoked paprika sauces, which were both really good. This and the cookie may have been my favorite part of the meal.  I ordered the fish combo--cod, perch and walleye, with fries, coleslaw and rye. The fish was good, but the breading was fairly flavorless, which was a little disappointing. I could have done without the fries. They were really not good--kind of bland and too crunchy. And the coleslaw was good, but it could have used more seasoning, as it was also a little bland. I really loved the fine cut cabbage though. It's exactly how all coleslaw should be."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service made everything great! I have been to Old Fashion for their famous cheese curds but finally got to try their brunch.  I had the breakfast sandwich with   potatoes. The muffin was toasted perfectly and the bacon was just the right amount of crisp. The  potatoes had to be my favorite though. They make them in house and were simple but amazing.   I was seated right away, however it was a Monday.  The server brought me a water right when I sat down then asked if I would like coffee or anything besides water. She never let my glass go empty and was extremely polite."}
{"text":"I finally broke down and went for lunch.  All in all, I liked it.  Their fried cheese curds were excellent.  The burger I had wasn't any better than anything I could make at home, so I wasn't overly impressed with that.    We went at lunch on a Friday.  Big mistake.  There was a line out the door and we ended up having to wait, huddled in the freezing entry, for almost twenty minutes to get a table.  The tables themselves are practically on top of the next table over.  There's almost zero privacy, so don't use this place for top secret business luncheons or to break up with someone.    Prices could be a bit better, but I'm not going to complain.  The odd system of ordering could be refined.  I found it frustrating to finally get a seat and then be told by a waitress who showed up tableside that I had to go stand around by the bartender for ten minutes until I could place an order.  The waitress was RIGHT THERE!  Why couldn't she help a dude out?    I'll go back, but I'm not in any hurry to do so."}
{"text":"Love the old fashioned! Could use a few more vegetarian options, but the food and service is always great."}
{"text":"Good strong drinks and hearty portions are features of this downtown favorite.  The only reason the Old Fashioned does not get 5 stars from me is that I am a big guy, and I feel like a bull in a china shop here when it is busy. If you are the least bit claustrophobic, this might not be the place for you.  That said, the food is good and reasonably priced, and the drinks (especially the brandy old fashioned) are strong and well mixed. I've had various burgers and sandwiches here, my favorite being the beer battered walleye sandwich. The broiled walleye sandwich at the Weary Traveler is better overall, but this is a close second. The fillet is substantial, if a little hard to eat on the sourdough.  The cheese curds are, from what I understand, one of the best things on the menu. I am not much of a cheese curd guy, and a friend and I ordered them one night. They are gooey and a bit too greasy for my tastes (even though I think that is why people love them). We had gut rot the rest of the night and ended up cutting our night short because of it."}
{"text":"I'm always happy when I come here and when I leave. The food is delicious. I always get the wedge salad and the fish sandwich. The spicy burger is also very good! A staple restaurant in Madison!"}
{"text":"Total stars: 4.5   The Old Fashioned is supposedly a classic joint in Madison, and my friends and I made plans for Sunday brunch when we were all in town for a wedding. They don't take reservations, but the wait time wasn't terrible for our group size (we had a party of 13, and only waited 30 minutes, which was no biggie since the arts festival was going on outside!)   The seating is a little weird on the inside - there's two sections on the interior - but they seated us comfortably at two booths adjacent to each other.   The brunch menu had plenty of offerings, as well as a larger drink menu. I was a little disappointed that there weren't any sweet/savory combinations, but there was still a variety of options for a very affordable or price. I had the corned beef hash, which was only around $7-8, and was very, very generously portioned (all orders were generously portioned!!) Table also ordered cheese curds (so!!! Good!!!!!) and a cheese plate (also good, but a little small imo).   Service was a little iffy though.. the hostess was super nice and accommodating of our large group, but our server was a little lukewarm. She was polite enough, but got a little upset at us when we asked her if we could have separate checks (\"you should have mentioned that when you came in\", but a group of 13 usually doesn't pay together unless they're family?) And then when there was an issue with the checks (she had double charged some orders onto two checks), it was a hassle and she made it seem like our fault...   But in any case, the Old Fashioned is a good and well-priced brunch, and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is happening!  Packed at 5 pm, good mix of young and old.  We got a beer sampler to share, priced at $8 for 8 of them (cheap).   Ordered a basket of deep fried cheese curds, awesome paired with the blue cheese horseradish sauce.  Also got one of the lazy susan appetizers.  It had herring, trout, salami, pickles, deviled eggs, pate.  A nice variety of food.  We left incredibly satisfied and very very full."}
{"text":"Absolutely love The Old Fashioned.  It's crowded, but it's so worth it.  Great for kids, excellent food.  Excellent drinks."}
{"text":"New to the Madison area so I came to Yelp and typed in \"best cheese curds\" and this came up.  I wanted to see the capitol building and saw that this was right across the street so decided on this place.  Oh my goodness, I am so happy we came here!  Food:  We ordered the cheese curds as an appetizer.  The best cheese curds I ever had!  Don't forget to chew them well.  I choked a bit.  Haha.  I can't even describe what they taste like...pure yumminess?!   (Though a bit greasy.)  Hubby and I both ordered burgers.  I ordered a Wisconsin cheese burger and upgraded my side to onion strings.  Hubby ordered the burger that comes with a fried egg and upgraded his side to warm potato chips.  The burgers were SO tasty.  Very minimal toppings and sauce.  The meat alone was fine by itself.  We both moaned with our first bite.  Haha.    Service/Pricing:  Seated immediately by hostess.  Crowded since it was lunch hour on a weekday.  Waitress was fine.  Nothing to complain or boast about.  Prices were great at least to us coming from California.  $7,95 for my burger plus a $1.00 charger for my upgraded side.  Cheap to us!  Location.:  First time being downtown.  Decided on a meter which was only $2.00 for 2 hours.  No problem parking on a weekday during lunch.  Verdict:  Definitely coming back even if for just the cheese curds!  Haha.  And requesting to sit outside with a view of the capitol building.  Not a beer drinker, but with over 100 choices, I really want to try something!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've only been 3-4 times, but certainly plan on going many times in the future. The food is amazing, the wait times are normal for a restaurant near the square. Their dinner menu is great, but their brunch menu is the true star. Yes, there is a longer wait time for brunch (particularly if Sunday brunch is your thing), but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call it the best fish fry in Dane county, there are so many others I won't mention here. Should you eat here definitely. It was a good fish fry. It was not all you can eat. I had the sampler plate with three different kinds of fish during lunch hour. The fish was not fishy at all. and was cooked perfect with not too much breading. It was not battered. The seasoned fries were REALLY salty. The slaw was also good. The Old Fashioned, ok. Again I've had way better elsewhere. The other person in our lunch had no complaints and enjoyed her food, I think she had a chicken sandwich. Again it is good food, it is really expensive for the same food you can get elsewhere, better and cheaper. The ambiance is old world tavern. and always crowded. I've never gotten a spot at the bar and I live right around the corner. The smell coming out of the kitchen that fills the neighborhood makes me want to eat there every day. If you are in ANY kind of hurry, you will wait to get in here. There is usually always a line no matter what time of day you go, especially weekend breakfasts and evenings. A lot of times the line is outside which means you can't wait at the bar and have a few drinks. All in all you should trying it."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is my go-to place for whenever anyone comes to visit me in Madison. If there's one place that does Wisconsin food, it's the Old Fashioned! Though, I'm new to this area, so my opinions can be completely wrong and I am okay with that.  Cheese curds are always a classic. I love all the dipping sauces here - spicy paprika is a great one.  I've only ever gotten brunch foods, and a walleye sandwich. Their rosemary red potatoes are amazing.  They do seasonal jams, I believe. I had wild cherry for my toast. It was also amazing.  Fun fact: there are 54 beers on tap. Welcome to Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Wow! How can I give it 5 stars without having tried any of the food? The drinks were THAT good.   First of all, they have a selection of over 150 beers, all brewed in Wisconsin, with 52 of them on tap. There is a rotating selection of on tap varieties with only 6 or so being house staples. The bartender was quite knowledgeable about all the beers and she also took pride in the fact that the restaurant helped establish several start-up breweries in Wisconsin and put their names on the map.   Their namesake drink, the old fashioned, also does not disappoint! I tried the applejack old fashioned which tasted either like a grown-up kiddie cocktail or a brandy version of sangria. It is the \"muddling\" that makes them so good, which is basically mashing sugar, bitters, cherries, and oranges in the bottom of the glass. If you drink out of the straw, the entire drink gets filtered through this muddled goodness.   You can also design your own old fashioned with your choice of: 1) Liquor (brandy, whiskey, bourbon, gin) 2) Type of bitters 3) Topper (soda, sprite, water, ginger beer) 4) Type of garnish (cherry & orange, brussel sprouts, olives)  Can't wait to come back and try the beer-battered cheese curds. Also saw something about a fried hot dog with mole sauce....."}
{"text":"On the road for business and this place has always been suggested from my local Madison colleagues. Finally took their advice and tried it out.   As soon as I walked I knew it wouldn't disappoint. I LOVED the atmosphere. Dim lighting, decorated for the holidays with strung lights, old sport and local signs hung on the walls and exposed brick.   Stopped in on a Sunday evening and they were decently busy. We waited for about 5-10 minutes before we got seated near the window. This was an amazing spot, as you could look out the window to see the fresh snow on the ground and the Madison Capitol Building.   Our waitress wasn't overly friendly but she took good care of us. You can't go to The Old Fashioned without ordering an old fashioned...so that is exactly what I did. I went for the classic with Korbel Brandy. My first time with brandy, and it was very tasty!  I ordered the beer battered walleye sandwich and cheese curds for the side. Squeaky cheese is a must in Wisconsin! The fish had great taste and the tartar sauce made the sandwich.   I would definitely come back to to have another old fashioned and to try other items on the menu. A fantastic dinner stop if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food, drinks & beer I have had in a while.  Great atmosphere and home of one of the best damn bartenders ever.  So nice we went twice."}
{"text":"First night in Madison and my friend who is going to school in town took me here because I'd be guaranteed the Wisconsin experience and I sure was! Loved the location with its rustic and relaxed ambiance. I ordered an Old Fashioned. I don't drink brandy often, but It was smooth and I truly enjoyed it. Obviously, when in WI, have to have cheese curds and they forever changed my life. I loved them and the paprika dipping sauce. My main course choice was the prime rib sandwich which was cooked to perfection and I loved that it came with a side of horse radish. The entire experience left a good taste in my mouth for Madison as a whole."}
{"text":"My food was way oversalted when it came out, cheese curds were good though."}
{"text":"There are only three words that can properly describe the Old Fashioned: Wisconsin, Wisconsin, Wisconsin.   While many may search the Madison area for the most eco-friendly, sustainable, organic, local, vegan, original, eclectic, and liberal friendly dining establishments, they need not search further than the Capital Square.  The Old Fashioned is everything you can ask for in a Madison, or to broaden things, a Wisconsin restaurant.  If you are looking for a plate full of aged cheese you've never even heard of, look no further.  If you're looking the best deep fried cheese curds in town, theirs are next to none.  If you're looking for the best selection of Wisconsin craft beers, you can stop looking.  This place has it all.  As what appears to be a reminiscence of an old fashioned Wisconsin supper club, this place delivers on all accounts.  From the nostalgic adds from the glory days of Schlitz and Hamm's to the dice game played at local Wisconsin bars, The Old Fashioned makes you feel like you're in an old Wisconsin supper club even if you never actually been to one.  But don't think this place is a secret.  Many Madisonians know that this place is worth frequenting, as anyone will notice if they try to find a table on almost any night of the week.  Generally, the wait for a table is 45 minutes to an hour if you attempt to visit the joint during dinner hours.  However, the wait is worth it, during which you can attempt to sample one of their hundreds of Wisconsin craft beers.  Just don't expect to find anything that is brewed outside of the State.  They have a tiny cooler marked \"imports\" which contains a small selection of beers such as Coors light; however, if you looking for such beers I'd suggest visiting somewhere else.  This is the place to find Wisconsin craft beers, along with some of the old favorites such as Schlitz, Blatz and Pabst Blue Ribbon.  Oh and by the way, The Old Fashioned is not just a clever name."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned.  It's a true classic Madison restaurant no matter how you slice it.  Located on the square allows it to be removed from the busy campus, and when you walk in there is a comfortable environment there waiting to have you.  The music is at an appropriate level, the food is delicious with many choices that will have you and your friends trying different things from week to week, and it's a great place to have a few beers.  The food here is not only classic Wisconsin roots (from refined Brats, to cheese curds, to heritage dishes you can barely pronounce), but also unique.  The menu hosts some 20-30 odd items (if not more) that all sound like a must-try.  This is also one of those places where I'd suggest an appetizer, which I usually do not.  A friend of mine speaks volumes of their cheese plate, but there's a lot of other choices that are perfectly reasonable as well.  As for entrees, my personal favorites are the mac and cheese (yes it's not for 5 year olds here) and the double-brat (or whatever fancy name they give it).  The old fashioned is not perfect though.  The service people I've had in the past have almost assuredly been rude.  From long waits to forgotten orders to unpleasant attitudes; you name it.  AND, speaking of long waits, this establishment almost always has a really long wait.  So go early, put your name in, and find another downtown bar to have a few drinks while you wait.  But be sure to wait, because it's worth it.  Lastly, The Old Fashioned is the perfect bar to get cosy and relax with a group of old friends.  It extends its appeal beyond that of a restaurant by being one of those places that you actually want to stay another hour or two afterwards and either drink at your table or drink at the bar.  The place never gets so loud that you can't converse, and with the variety of drinks most of your party should be able to find something they enjoy."}
{"text":"Ok - Buddy suggested this place and I was a bit skeptical when he was raving about the cheese curds...  Basically wrote the place off as a typical, hick Wisco dive.  But I was wrong.  Great place.  Had the perch fish fry on a WESNESDAY.  Breaking the Wisconsin Friday night fish fry was a nice change of pace.  We also got the fried cheese curds as an app and they were pretty darn good.  You get you choice of dipping sauces.  It is also located right across the street from the capitol, which was pretty cool.  We got to see a couple hundred protesters against Walkers bill.  Also - had to try my first Old Fashioned... not a big fan.  Waitress recommended the mac and cheese + the old fashioned burger too... we caught a glimpse of these going to other tables - FOOD ENVY!  I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"In planning a trip to visit Madison, I wanted to make sure we got to The Old Fashioned.   I had heard so many great things about it from friends who've been there, and I had read so many great reviews online on the restaurant.   It seemed like a prime location--right across the street from the capital building.   After waiting for an hour (this place was PACKED!), we finally got to our table, and we were flipping through their menu and loving it--so many unique sandwich options!   The atmosphere is nice in there--casual, kind of classy/trendy.   Service here was awesome. Depite how busy they were and how stressed out they must have felt, the staff still had welcoming smiles on their faces the whole time and was so attentive.   The food came surprisingly quickly and was very yummy.   Can't wait to come back here when I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Food is yummy, but NO LONGER MAKE HOT MINI DONUTS :(   came for the deep fried cheese curds, Meat scrambler with gruyere, hash and eggs, pancakes, farm fresh sunny side eggs meal, and sour cherry or berry jam.... Will come back next time in town."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is great. The service is always good. The food is consistent"}
{"text":"Mixed emotions.  The first time we went to The Old Fashioned was on a Saturday morning in the Summer.  We enjoyed a bite at one of the tables on the street.  Nice.  My other experience was on a weekday.  We went to get a beer and talk for a bit.  We sat at the bar and waited for 15 minutes with no one acknowledging us.  And it was not dead nor was it really busy.  What made it worse was that there were at least three bartenders and one of them got drinks for a waitress right in front of us!  I do not think that we will return."}
{"text":"This place is one of my critical stops when visiting Madison.  It can get a bit busy, but the Old Fashiond's are tasty and the food is great as well."}
{"text":"Love having breakfast here.  It's well worth doing breakfast here! The pancakes are very good. The bacon is good. I like the breakfast potatoes.   The service is as good as anywhere for breakfast."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a Madison classic. Good food, sometimes overrated but definitely tasty food.  One thing that isn't overrated, however are the cheese curds. They are exceptional and come with your choice of unique sauces.  The place is always packed and sometimes it's a long wait for seating and is definitely always loud.  Still, it's a must for visiting Madison."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best restaurant in Madison hands down. A true taste of the town with a neat ambience near the capital. Whenever friends come into town,  I take them here for cheese curds with tiger sauce, a spotted cow (local brew), and dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing cheese curds!! The No. 19 salad was fantastic... wish they sold the hot bacon dressing separately! Tasty namesake drink, waiter was very helpful getting recommendations and accommodating our large group. Solid experience, would definitely return."}
{"text":"This seems to be the place one would have to go to if visiting Madison for the first time. Tried the roasted pork sandwich with cheese curds and the prime rib with onion strings. Food was very good. If anything we were starting to feel stuffed and couldn't finish all of the food. We also split the beer cheese soup. They put popcorn in it. It felt more like a sauce than a hearty soup but we both still loved it.   The wait was long but they took our number to text us when we were ready. Unfortunately, there was a race going on and we were so caught up in exploring the city so it took us longer to get back to the restaurant when we received our text. They still accommodated us which was and is much appreciated."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service from every staff person that even walked past me while picking up my take-out order.  The veggie sandwich (with cheddar instead of goat cheese) was very good but quite greasy. The haystack onion strings were delicious. The cheese curds are very overrated in my opinion. They were greasy and a flatten, squished-together mess. I felt like I could get a better order of cheese curds at a hundred other Wisconsin restaurants. Even Culver's (regional fast food chain) has better curds."}
{"text":"Classic Wisconsin food with solid beverage and beer selections.  The atmosphere is very festive and fun.  There isn't a ton of places to sit though so there can be waits.  Breakfast wasn't anything special though."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want some Wisconsin food in a Wisconsin bar/restaurant! Best Brandy Old Fashions around. Great Old fashion burger too. You can't go wrong with anything there"}
{"text":"I after my last experience at the Old Fashioned, I refuse to return. First, the male host was more concerned with his hair then sitting people and the food at most is mediocre. Not sure what the hype is, because it's not that great. There are far better places to dine and eat in Madison."}
{"text":"Good bar food. But very overrated by everyone around Madison. If you're new here and staying here for a day or two and someone suggested this to you, definitely do it. But I'd you've a week to explore, I'd suggest trying other cheese curds and other Wisconsin delicacies in other nearby places as well."}
{"text":"This bar was packed when my bf and I walked in! The wait was supposed to be 2 hours, but luckily, we were able to snag some seats by the bar fairly quickly.   We immediately ordered cheese curds and the cheese spread sampler (when in Wisconsin...) The cheese curds were like little fried pieces of crack! I still think about them every so often. And the cheese spread was equally appetizing.  The beef jerky we later ordered came as a generous slice that covered half of the plate it came on.  It was the perfect salty snack to go with our beer.  The beer selection at this place is great and is bound to have something for everyone.    Big thumbs up to Madison after visiting this place!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best restaurants in Madison. Loved every bite till the last. The old fashions are amazing, a little overpriced, but well worth the money. If you're visiting Madison this is the one place you need to be."}
{"text":"Wonderful everything. If you want a great old fashioned and then eat some great dinner and good wine, you came to the right place - older atmosphere but younger crowd and well done everything.  In Madison, a cool mad city, you can hardly go wrong."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is a testiment to Wisconsin cuisine.  Named after the unoffical state cocktail, it serves up a variety of supper club staples all prepared with a loving touch.  With staff from local foodie favorites Harvest and Lombardino's on board, every entree has a touch of class.  Sandwiches and appertizers are the order of the day with everything being reasonably priced.  Check out the cheese curds, a lazy susan, and the double brat (Sheboygan classic).  Wash it all down with an Old Fashioned (Korbel.  Muddled.  Always.) or a beer from the impressive booze list."}
{"text":"Took the girlfriend there on a Saturday night when we were traveling through Madison and we loved the food especially the cheese curds and there wonderful selection of beers. This place has a great atmosphere near the state capital. Highly recommend stopping here and having a beer and cheese curds. There burger was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Decent food. Seems to be a popular place to take out of town guests for a burger and cheese curds.  Great beer selection.  Can get very crowded and loud."}
{"text":"Great drinks, not a huge fan of the food menu- but I don't eat fried food. My friends all rave over the cheese curds though. They have a huge beer list and make great old fashioneds! They also have karaoke on Wednesdays which is fun"}
{"text":"Yum.  I wish there was an equivalent of The Old Fashioned in Ann Arbor, but perhaps it is best that there isn't, because my disposable income isn't as flexible as I'd like.  Their drink menu is massive.  Out of the few I tried, I enjoyed the hard lemonade the most, though the raspberry beer wasn't bad either.  I'm not huge on fried food, but the garlic cheese curds were sufficiently tasty.  The pork shoulder sandwich probably wasn't the best choice for me, as I prefer salads, but it was also above average, as far as sandwiches go.  Not too shabby, Madison."}
{"text":"Just great food here. We started with the highly recommended cheese curds and of course some old fashioned's. For our entree we had the house burger which is a burger with cheese, bacon and an egg. Let me tell you the burger was a beautiful eggy mess and the curds were the best we had in Madison.The old fashioneds we exactly what you'd expect from a place called The Old Fashioned which is to say just right. Great service good food; a must eat."}
{"text":"The classic place to visit in Madison. Good local fair, locally sourced. If you want to sample what 'Sconsinites love, this is the place to go. Fried cheese curds, charcuterie plates, good burgers, a MASSIVE selection of WI brews. And, of course, great old fashions. There is healthier fair too, LOL. No regrets here."}
{"text":"This place has a great list of beers on tap and as you could have guessed great old fashioned list too. I ordered the Door County Old Fashioned which has the sour cherry juice from Door county in it. It was great! The food is good and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"As a vegan, I can't honestly review the food here since it is very \"meat and potatoes\"--think classic Wisconsin Supper Club food but dressed up for the hip Madison Crowd who would otherwise look down their nose at this style of cuisine. I'm rating this as a bar. Their beer selection is solid--not as good as say, the Malthouse--but pretty good. And the pours are affordable. I recommend coming here and doing a couple of sampler rounds with friends, ordering a big plate of fries and just people-watching on the square. It gets really crowded though, which is lame, and suffers from a really bad faux-smoke smell that might bother you."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and as always it was packed. We didn't wait long for a table and our server appeared in minutes with ice water. We both ordered a cup of soup - roasted garlic parsnip with homemade croutons - and salads. Mine was the beet salad with gorgonzola and pecans. It was huge and delicious, as was the soup. Our server checked on us periodically and kept our drinks filled.  One small complaint is the blast of cold air each time the door opens. Not sure what can be done, but not the best setup for those sitting near it. All in all a solid lunch."}
{"text":"Nothing is better then having cheese curds and Friday fish fry on the Madison capital. I recommend calling a head of time to make sure they have tables available. Can be super busy sometimes, but that's just because of how amazing and locally fresh the food is. Their Italian sausage they get is from Frabonies so if you like local made and produced food is highly suggest going here"}
{"text":"Great place for a steak and you wouldn't think it. The bartender J.R. Is the best bartender I have ever had and I travel a lot. Great service, good drinks. He will recommend whatever you are in the mood for and find the right drink. This is my 3rd time here and he exceeds expectations every time."}
{"text":"My first restuarant I visted while in Madison. I ordered some cheese curds which were amazing and The Old Fashioned House Burger-grilled over a live fire and topped with fried onions, Bavaria's hickory-smoked bacon, aged Cheddar, garlic sauce and a soft-cooked egg on a buttered and toasted roll and fries.. The burger and Cheese Curds were phenomenal. Wasn't really impressed with the fries.. They could  have been seasoned better.. Defintelly get a beer (Spotted Cow) and cheese curds if visting!"}
{"text":"Always a great stop in Madison!! I think of The Old Fashion as the anchor to all of the great restaurants on the square. It's consistently good, and always packed with both locals and travelers. A good/fun mix with a great selection of cocktails and food.  The curds are the best around!"}
{"text":"Love: hot turkey sandwich, cheese curds with ranch, tap beer selection  Not a big fan of the wait times, so go at an off-peak time!"}
{"text":"This is the city hot spot! It did take a while to get seated, too crowded at the bar to sit so that was awkward standing over people while they are. VERY loud. Food was good, definitely a pub atmosphere."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good old fashioned?  I come here for 4 reasons:  1. Cheese Curds - Y E S  2. Hot Toddy - a warm boozy drink, believe me in Madison...in the winter...you'll need it 3. Old fashioned - they have like 10 to choose from, come on now...how awesome is that  4. warmth - back to step 2  Servers are nice, drinks are good, and the cheese curds are scrumptious.  Not sure how the food is, I've never ordered a main entree.      It's one of my must visit places when I'm in WI.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great beer list.  They make the best old fashioned cocktails.  You have to order one when you eat here.  Fried cheese curds with garlic sauce is the perfect snack when you stop in for drinks.   They are known for their burgers and rightfully so. I love the fried egg on it- even if it can get messy.  Their fries are not my favorite..nothing special."}
{"text":"The Old Fashioned is the first place everyone in Madison will tell a Madison-neophyte to go for one simple rule: it's Wisconsin with the volume turned up to 11.  The menu is large, but not nearly as large as the portions.  I recommend sharing the lazy-Suzanne starters, or maybe just having them as your meal.  They also have good cheese-curds and salads (ironically enough).  I always leave with left-overs and, with the exception of the usually long wait-time for a table, I have never been disappointed.  The tap-list is extensive and I think exclusively Wisconsinite, as well.  Their brunch isn't bad either!"}
{"text":"The food is SOOO good! I love their cheese curds, their Old Fashioned's of course, and service has never let me down."}
{"text":"I went here to escape the rain after a particularly cold day at the farmers market. I sat at the bar and got a bloody mary because I was told they are the best in Madison. It was good but I don't know if I would call it \"the best.\" However, they do give you a beer with the bloody so major bonus points! I also ordered breakfast which was tasty but bar food style and pretty greasy. They make an emphasis on their menu about how \"fresh\" it is- that may be the case but it certainly isn't a light or healthy place to get a meal.   The wait staff was friendly and it was an overall pleasant experience. If you are looking to have a big loud brunch after a day of drinking or a family style meal I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Plenty of nearby parking available.    The building is an interesting use of the original structure. The layout is efficient,  and decorated perfectly.   The staff is polite, knowledgeable and on spot to keep you satisfied without hovering.  The food is simply perfect! If simplicity is the key, then they nailed it! The menu is diverse enough,  yet on point to satisfy almost everyone. I found the pork shoulder to be near perfection on texture,  moist, and delicately seasoned. This, mixed with the relish, made for a great meal. Don't forget the curds!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection but the food was nothing special. The pickles beans were really interesting. Best part of the meal was the Old Fashioned ice cream. Booze + ice cream = can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I've come here for breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks. First off, it's almost always a wait to get a table here. They don't usually take reservations, so you kind of have to take your chances. Typically, there aren't even bar seats available to sit at while you wait for a table, which sometimes means you'll need to wait outside. Obviously the crowds are a testament to how good this place is. It's the kind of place where you'd want to take someone who is visiting for the weekend. They have a huge selection of Wisconsin beers (and they offer tasting flights!) and hands down, the best cheese curds in Madison.   For lunch, I've had the burger with the fried egg, and for brunch, I had a special with corned beef hash. For the rave reviews this place gets, I would have thought there would be a bit more to the menu, but I guess it's about quality and not quantity. I wouldn't mind if there were a few more choices, though."}
{"text":"Not sure what I can add that will convince you to visit but here goes. Great beers on tap - huge selection of all-Wisconsin beers. I wish I could have had a few more, but loved the Spotted Cow. The beer cheese soup with crunch popcorn tidbits was amazing, as was the fish and chips. Delicately battered and served with crunch fries. The cole slaw was perfectly seasoned with little celery seed bits - loved it. Service is fairly attentive but it's so darn busy, you won't be disappointed. This is a can't miss place in Mad-Town."}
{"text":"The decor in this restaurant is wonderful, and the food was stellar too. I had walleye with eggs and potatoes. The rest of my table was very pleased with what they ordered too. I missed out on the Bloody Marys; those looked quite popular"}
{"text":"Servings are huge, I'll give them that. I picked this place for my weekend trip to Madison because it felt appropriately Wisconsin-esque, with the much-hyped cheese curds and substantial beer list (which I didn't get--I'll admit maybe that would have swayed my rating a bit). We arrived at 6:15 on a Saturday, and already the wait was insanely long. After about a half hour, we were seated in the hustle and bustle of the main room, amongst what I'm guessing must be like 300 patrons at any given time (in the multiple rooms on the multiple floors). Seriously, the place is huge. I guess that's maybe why it felt a bit like a factory of sorts. It was so loud, and I felt like until I was seated, I was constantly in someone's way, whether I was being jostled by a server balancing plates, someone standing at the bar with a beer, or another person trying to find a spot to wait in the warm room until the table was ready.  Our waiter was rushed and barely stopped by our table at all, but he was certainly nice. We got the onion haystack to start, and like I said before, the serving was way more than expected. Between the two of us, we maybe made it through half of the appetizer. My husband got the mac n' cheese, which was good but not amazing, and I got the salmon salad, which was similarly good but not amazing. So in short, the food was decent, service was decent, but nothing about the place was stellar enough that I could understand the hype. That, plus a wall of hungry faces staring at you in the hope that you'll hurry up and vacate your table made for, at most, a decent dinner."}
{"text":"A Madison institution if ever there was one.  Right on the Capitol square is a great place to stop  for a bacon, egg & cheese burger.  On top of the gooey burger the side order of cheese curds is excellent.  All in an older building that fits the times but retains its old fashioned appeal.  Perhaps the only downside is that they really pack in the people,  sometimes right on top of one another.  Definitely not a destination for a quiet date night but short of that a definite worthy stop when dining near the Capitol."}
{"text":"Good old fashioneds and fish fry for a Friday night. The drinks were premixed and were much sweeter than I typically like. The cod was flaky and delicious and the fried cheese curds were everything that you could hope for - and more!"}
{"text":"Went here with my parents while we were in town! None of us had ever been here before, and we were really impressed! There was a wait for tables, but the hostess treated us great - we also got $1 off drink coupons, so we went to the bar and had WI old fashioneds. The bartenders were super nice and gave us beer trials while we were up there too. When we were seated and got dinner, it was amazing. Everyone at the table ordered something different, but they were all spectacular. Waitstaff was awesome too - we wanted for nothing. This is a great place to take people for the WI experience"}
{"text":"Great, casual atmosphere with really great and reasonably priced food! Visiting Madison and looked for the best fried cheese curds.  Amazing cheese curds!! Perfectly fried and soft and delicious. The chips and dipping sauce are great too.  They have some specials daily - I tried the chicken Mediterranean club - very good! Friends tried the Mac and cheese and said it was fantastic also. Seems like a great place to stop by for a casual bite to eat right in downtown Madison!"}
{"text":"this place is a nice place to go to with friends with good food and good atmosphere...but beware of their wait times!!   my favorite are the little gourmet hamburgers in this place as well as their brownie desert.  However it is a little pricey so go somewhere else if your trying to not spend too much money... and time"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some regional beers. I'm from out of town and I was hankering to try something from the area. Thankfully, I got off the bus near the Old Fashioned. They have a huge range of beers and some cheap tasting flight options as well. The wait staff is friendly, attentive and has lots of suggestions as well. I would recommend anything by Lake Louie, especially the Warped Speed Scotch Ale. I haven't tried any of the cocktails, but they have a number of options there as well. You can even \"make your own old fashion\" with a range of bitters and whiskeys.   The food is alright. I would come here more for the drinks."}
{"text":"They are serious about their cheese here!!  With good reason!  The chocolate oatmeal stout goes perfect with lunch!  Atmosphere is a combination of your local diner and pub only a bit nicer...solid bar, hardwood floor, great staff!"}
{"text":"I know people rave about this place and there is always a line, but when it comes down to it they serve enormous plates of mediocre food.  Yes, the bread on that sandwich is as large as three slices, but it's slightly stale and not very tasty.  And the fried whitefish is not properly boned.   When it comes down to it, it's a supersized TGIF with much better drinks.  But you can get equally good drinks at a dozen places within 10 minutes walking distance of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I like Old Fashioned a lot! I've been here a handful of times and every time has been pleasant.   Good atmosphere, friendly staff, DELICIOUS food!  The cheese curds seem to be a huge favorite among others, but for me they are just, meh. Don't get me wrong, they are quite yummy - but not the best I've ever had. Definitely not the best in Madison as I have heard others proclaim. Just a little too greasy for me.   Wine Slush is amazing. It tastes more like a red wine sangria, has hints of fruit in it. It is so good. Even in the middle of winter with 12° temps outside, it's a great choice.   I tried the chicken and biscuits today. OMG. So good. And huge!! BF got a burger which looked great. The fries that came with were seriously some of the most perfect fries I've ever had.   Gets pretty busy in the evenings, especially when there are sporting events. We came in around 4 on a Saturday which was perfect timing. By the time we were leaving it was getting very loud and crowded, though our meal was pretty quiet and calm.   Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I like going there for drinks bc of good selection and I love their cheese curds. That's about it for me there"}
{"text":"What can I say?... We've been to the Old Fashioned four times, and, yes, the food is good and, yes, they have a nice selection of beer at a reasonable price. What I don't like about the Old Fashioned is waiting well over an hour to be seated with no real room at the bar to relax while we wait.  Our last straw was the night we went to see a play on a Thursday night that started at 7:30. We arrived at the Old Fashioned at 5:30. Our mistake was not realizing this restaurant is treated like Sardi's by the people in Madison who are apparently willing to stand and wait a considerable length of time to eat an egg-topped burger.  We waited 1 1/2 hours to be seated. It had originally started out as 45 minutes but the wait time kept getting extended. We finally had to leave before we were seated to make it to our play on time. When we went back after the play to finally get a bite to eat, they wouldn't let us back in because my daughter wasn't 21. And that's how that went...  Sure I like a good burger, but service is important to me also. We won't be going back.  If you're looking for some great cheese curds, just hit a Mallards game.  You'll get delicious cheese curds, a place to sit and a great game to watch!"}
{"text":"Hmmmmm...fried cheese curds!!! I've never heard of fried cheese curds until I came to Madison. Of course, Wisconsin is known for cheese, but this place blew it away with their FRIED CHEESE CURDS! I tried fried cheese curds at other establishments like Great Danes, but they were nothing compared to the Old Fashioned. The fried cheese curds here are crispy on the outside and gooey in the inside. I've tried several of their dishes and my favorite would be the Old Fashioned House Burger. The egg in the burger gave it an extra kick. The service is great. I've been there several times and haven't ran into anyone rude. The wait time is extremely long, it's probably better to try your luck at the bar. If I am in the area, I would definitely stop by for some of their famous fried cheese curds and a nice glass of cold beer! I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I usually get salads as I'm not a huge fan of sandwiches in general, and I've loved all the ones I've tried. The service is good. The only downside is that there is almost always a long wait, and the bar area is not big enough to accommodate everyone who is waiting. They do have breakfast, but I don't think it's all that good, and they stop serving breakfast way too early."}
{"text":"Good drinks, good food, good prices. Right near the capitol building very nice."}
{"text":"I recently made a visit to Madison and was looking for some local food.  Overall the place was packed and it was during the week, but was surprised at the reasonable noise level.  My waitress was very nice and help my colleague and I order something local.  I found the cheese curbs to be pure evil and could not stop eating.  The old fashion I had was perfect after 3 hrs traveling.  Overall I would go again on my next visit to Madison"}
{"text":"Really, the cheese curds alone are worth a 5 star review.  But everything else is just as good!  I would say if you are in Madison you must stop what you are doing, run to this place and order some cheese curds and a beer, but it seems that everyone already knows that!  It was packed when we first arrived from Chicago at 12:30 on a Saturday.  We had to wait about 45 minutes for a two top, but when you get to sip on a frosty glass of  the local Hopalicious brew while you're waiting, the time just flies by.  So after devouring the basket of cheese curds (served with smoked paprika dipping sauce, thank you very much) in about 4 minutes, I moved on to ordering a flight of delicious craft brews which came out proudly displayed on a Wisconsin shaped tray.  Lunch was an amazing sandwich that consisted of grilled eggplant, roasted red peppers, zucchini and goat cheese piled on buttery, lightly toasted country bread.  YUM.  The service was exceptional.  Our waiter made excellent beer suggestions and even wrote down the name of one so we could remember it after we left.  We happened to be in Madison for a night and I'm glad someone recommended The Old Fashioned for lunch, however I would have no problem driving two hours from Chicago to hit this place up again sometime.  It was worth the drive."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great food at a decent price then the Old Fashioned is the place.  The food here is AMAZING.  You should make sure you have a burger with an egg on it, especially if it is a Monday night (buy one get one free burgers for 5.95).  A few other favorites include beer cheese soup, deep fried cheese curds with paprika sauce, and friday night fish fry (or if its not friday the wall-eye sandwich is a delicious substitute).  They have an extensive selection of local brews and the best old-fashioned's anywhere.  In my opinion I've tried almost everything on the menu and never once been disappointed.  Everything is fresh from WI.  Some nights it gets really busy, and it is quite loud.  Its a great place for a good time with friends."}
{"text":"We had a large group on a busy Friday night and the staff were very accommodating and helpful with getting us a table. Our server was great and very knowledgeable on the special brews being offered. It was Friday and we were entertaining friends from Seattle who have only heard of Wisconsin Friday night fish fry. We heard it was good at the Old Fashioned. Most of us ordered the combo fish fry with cod perch and walleye. It tasted good but the fish serving size was not adequate for the price. The walleye was just as big as the little perch fillets. Very small portions of fish. Was anything but representing  Friday fish fry in Wisconsin. I will stick to burgers and curds here from now on."}
{"text":"Casual, busy, good beer selection, awesome potato chips.  The food menu is too short."}
{"text":"My husband and I were passing through from Cleveland.  This place had the greatest beer selection, fantastic service and awesome cheese curd.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best cheeseburger I've ever had, hands down. My co-worker and I came early for dinner, around 5pm, and it was perfect timing because they didn't get super busy yet. Within an hour, it got SUPER packed. You can really tell how popular this place is. The service was great and friendly, and the menu has a ton of items on it.   And oh my...the fried cheese curds were amazing. I'm not from Wisconsin, so it was my first time trying them. I'm lactose intolerant so I had to take a few lactaid pills to digest it, but I would do it again. They were absolutely delicious. Try a few of the cool and different sauces they have. It was so good with the garlic sauce that we had. They have deals on weeknights too, check them out! We had a buy one get one cheeseburger free deal, and that's pretty awesome. I'm definitely coming back here if I'm ever in Madison again."}
{"text":"Dropped by for breakfast on a weekday. Needed a place to catch up on email and enjoy some good coffee. Service was great, interior was very dark. Menu is good with lots of locally sourced ingredients and the \"cheese curds\" that one finds on seemingly every Wisconsin menu."}
