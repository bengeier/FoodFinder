{"text":"Yes, it is a little more expensive than some other places BUT the food quality is way better! The butter chicken was well spiced (not as spicy as I'd prefer). The lamb chops were moist and flavorful (chef/owner- if you are reading this: I'd reduce the salt a little).

The girl working there on the busy Friday night is great! Very kind and good customer service!"}
{"text":"I had heard about the Waterloo location and glad there is finally one in Mississauga.
As you walk in the door, nice and clean aesthetic and very family friendly as well.
I had the Butter Chicken with fries and rice. The fries have a different seasoning on them and are tasty. 

The Butter Chicken was AMAZING! - Unlike too many other spots where they focus on making it extra sweet and dousing it with cream, this dish actually has flavour. It has a spicy but nothing too intense taste to it and works great as a dipping sauce for the fries. 

The unlimited Butter Naan (delicious) is always welcome :-) and great with the gravy items. The Dine in (which is what I did) is substantial and I felt satisfied with the value for food. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for dinner.
First thing you notice is that it has a high ceiling and the dinning layout is like a school cafeteria.
You order from set menus. Be careful, the pop can tops were not very clean, especially if you are drinking from the can.

We ordered one of the large meat platters, and a bowl of Nirhani. The food took a bit of a while to come to the table. Over all the food, as others have commented is very bland. Aunty is not in the kitchen!!

One of the owners popped into the restaurant, the fat one, and he seemed very rude. He showed no customer service skills and made us feel uncomfortable.   
There was a lot of noise from kids, and the parents did not seem to care either."}
{"text":"Great environment, fast service and excellent food. Not what you're expecting until you try it."}
{"text":"Good Pakistani food. The menu selection is rather limited, but the dishes I tried (Karachi Kabab and Peshawari Tandoori Chicken) were delicious. Prices were reasonable. Overall, we had a nice dinner experience."}
{"text":"This place is good, but not great, at what they do. I've had the butter chicken poutine several times, and it's always severely lacking in cheese. I've requested extra cheese and offered to pay more for it but to no avail.  The butter chicken is fairly nice, a bit of spice without overdoing it and very creamy. The meat is about 2/3 white meat...all white meat would be better for sure. We've also enjoyed the chick pea and cauliflower dishes in the past. Service is alright. On the whole certainly nothing to write home about, but not terrible either."}
{"text":"My first time at this new restaurant and my first impression is i am impressed with the quality and quantity of food you get for only $10. I don't normally eat Indian food but I'm glad I have it a try will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their unlimited supply of naan bread is to die for. They have excellent food buy unfortunately I found their lunch special to be useless. I personally wouldn't go there for lunch but I highly recommend ordering their nihari. Their kulfi is absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Waterloo's version is better. I bought the lunch special and threw away my entire Tandoori chicken because it wasn't cooked all the way through. I also got the strangest looking butter chicken I've ever seen (I still ate it but it did not taste like butter chicken).  

Not worth it."}
{"text":"Auntys kitchen is kind of a Pakistani western fusion restaurant. 

I came here to enjoy some of their Halwa Puri nastha (breakfast) and I would say it was greasy and good.The meal came with 2 Poori freshly fried, Halwa (Dessert), Aloo curry (Potatos), Channa curry (chickpea), small portion of Achaar (pickle) as well as an omelette. The entire meal was hot and fresh and served nicely. Although, I would like mention that the dish was costlier than other places.

Service was ok but the chef/owner did a round of checking the tables after he was free from the kitchen. 

To my Muslim folks, they serve halal."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience at Auntys kitchen. First time trying this place out after hearing about it from some family friends. Came with my wife and kids and enjoyed the family-friendly experience. As for the food, we ordered the MSD chicken roll, nihari, fusion plate and Nutella naan.

MSD roll was EXCELLENT! The chicken was juicy and had a good amount of spice! The bread it was wrapped in was soft and brought the entire sandwich together.

Nihari was better than the average local restaurant and had plenty of meat. A bit oily, but that's generally all nihari dishes so no real complaints there.

Fusion plate was super special!! The meat and rice and butter chicken sauce was a delightful combo. My kids loved it! The spice they add on the fries are to die for! I asked for extra seasoning for the fries and was not disappointed, highly recommended on the fries!

Nutella naan was out of this world! It was the only thing I got to take a picture of bc we went to town on all the other food before we could think of taking a picture. Generous amounts of Nutella made for a delectable dessert option. 
Suggestion: add a scoop of ice cream on this and game over!

All in all, a great experience. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Was hoping to meet the owners, but had just missed them. Looking forward to returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"The highs: unlimited buttery naan. The service from the one male brown server. Maybe just maybe the nihari. 

The lows: I just hate seeing red in my meat. Felt the meat in the kebabs and nihari was uncooked but the one server explained it's because their meat is fresh so even when they cook their food well done we'll always see the red. I'm not a professional chef (not yet at least) so I don't know how true this is. But I appreciated his efforts in explaining and he was really the only server who kept asking us how we were doing, and was proactive in making sure we were well taken care of. 

The mediums: nice casual atmosphere for families. My little niece was hyper after having chocolate for breakfast and no one was giving us strange looks because the place is bustling with its own noise. Service is very fast. Food is alrightish, ok, good, not bad."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Good food and good mango lassi.  They could do with an additional server during busy days... because service was quite slow. 
Unlimited naans are a good perk provided they get to your table before the food gets cold. 
The rice pudding was good too. 
Additional star for clean toilets and for having a baby changing table in there. 
The high chairs were luxurious too!!"}
{"text":"There's a lot of mixed emotions in the reviews around Aunty's Kitchen and their new location on Erin Mills. Some argue that this place makes food as it should be and that's it, while others  are blown away by their flavours and customer service. 

Having not been overly exposed to Pakistani food many times before, I can only assess based on first impressions and on my experience. 

TL;DR: Excellent bold flavours, every detail considered and a great value paired with helpful, professional service.

The plaza is brand new with many spaces not yet leased out, but this means everything, including this restaurant, is brand spankin' new, and squeaky clean. Best of all, for any strip mall set up, they have an excessive amount of parking, so no worries for when this plaza begins to fill up (and it will).

On the advice of the staff, I ordered their kebab meal which came with rice, choice of salad or their signature fries, and two ground meat spiced kebabs AND UNLIMITED Naan bread.

The wait for freshly made is always a tad longer, so while this place looks like a more fast food set up because you order from the counter, don't expect a McDonalds turnaround time, set your expectations on a regular sit down restaurant turn around (10-20 minutes).

Food arrived shortly thereafter and wow what a portion, it took my server 2 trips to drop everything off between the meal (which was substantial), the multitude of sauces and naan bread.

As I mentioned, I don't have a lot of experience with Pakistani food so I'll get my one taste preference out of the way now  - the naan. I'm used to a fluffier naan so it was an adjustment to eating something a little flatter and more crispy. This could be a cultural difference or something this place does differently. At any rate, it was the one thing I was unsure of.

That aside this meal was EPIC (all letter capitalised) the Kebabs were sold as spicy, I tend to enjoy spicy so I found them to be spiced well but not spicy like my mouth was on fire. The meat was juicy, perfectly grilled and a generous portion. The house fries really were remarkable, perhaps double fried for extra crisp with a soft centre and the rice was abundant and had a nice touch of oil to it to keep it moist.

I'm not deducting a star but simply withholding it until I've had a chance to try a couple more menu items. Overall, a great meal and one I will go back for. For my Muslim friends know that they're foods are all Halal friendly so you can score some awesome eats during Ramadan and the rest of the year without worry!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Best Pakistani food in all of GTA! 
Authentic Pakistani flavour not Indian! 
Everything on the menu was fantastic"}
{"text":"Great staff. Foods average and priced on the high side. Please stop using pre packaged parathas ** That's NOT a paratha**"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom after seeing it featured on Mississauga eats instagram 

It's reallllly good and so worth the price. Unlimited naan and a lot of variety! 

Butter chicken was great, salad was fresh. Fish was cooked perfect. Tandoori chicken was the only short fall but it wasn't bad, just not as good as everything else I had 

I would highly recommend this place !! 

Lunch special is bomb!"}
{"text":"First time and MAZA AAYA (means delicious) .. ordered Nihari and BBQ platter .. good enough for 2 couple, and got free rice pudding in a Pakistani style clay pots .. enjoyed it thoroughly .. the host promised that he will not charge if I don't like the nihari, but I couldn't help the honesty behind the good nihari .. the kebabs, tikkas, ribs, chicken bbqd cubes were equally good. I will go back again, to make sure they are consistent"}

{"text":"Been a big fan of Aunty's Kitchen since the days I've been in Waterloo. Their prices seem to have gone up over the years but nevertheless, I will continue to be a loyal customer. My family absolutely loves their butter chicken dinner ($13.99). As a strong critic of curries, even my grandmother loves this place! She lives in Scarborough and she asks that I bring her home a box every single time!

Their naans are always fresh and their butter chicken is perfectly spicy. The butter chicken dinner comes with rice, a choice between fries or salad, and naan (unlimited if you dine-in)."}
{"text":"Came here twice for lunch. First time I had the Nihari curry which is their specialty. Second time I had one of the lunch specials. I was not disappointed.

The food I tried were flavorful. Compared with Indian food I find that Pakistani food tends to be heavier on the heat. Otherwise it's substantially the same type of food. They have curries, and various meats. I like how this place is modernized and offer modern takes on traditional foods like Nihari poutine and Nutella Naan. 

Space is modern, spacious, and bright, which is very refreshing for this type of restaurant.

Prices are fair. I wouldn't come here if I'm gunning for value. Like this lunch special sounds like a lot but it's just 1 skewer and 2 small pieces of butter chicken.

I'll definitely be back. I want to try their more modern dishes and some of their grilled meats."}
{"text":"Good food and serving but staff is real stingy on napkins, extra plates and utensils to eat. They bring food out without all these things and you have to ask a few times before they bring it to you. Don't know what they are saving that for if customers don't use it. 

Went there twice and happened both times."}
{"text":"****UPDATED REVIEW****
dropping my review from 2 stars down to 1 star.  i just found out and witnessed the so called \"paratha\" they serve is a frozen Shaana paratha purchased from WalMart or Loblaw or any Indian Pakistani grocery stores in Canada.  They lie and deceive the customer by making them think they are making a fresh paratha for them but instead use a pre-packaged frozen paratha that you buy for $1.99 for the pack of 5 at your local grocery stores.

Dear Mr. Management (Zubair).  This is ridiculously cheap and deceiving of you to do so. and please do not send me messages back forth like last time.

****OLD REVIEW****

Aunty's Kitchen is just a new idea in the Indo-Pak restaurant community. They try to give it more like Paramount and Bamyan Kabab touch with a little success.

the food is way too much over priced for the quality.  I had their \"best\" beef nihari and it lacked the main nihari ingredients. i can bet $100 they used the pre-mixed nihari masala you can buy at your local Indian grocey store.

nihari gets 1 out of 5 stars

the naans are not even real naan. it is not tandoori naan which you would normally bake in the clay oven. instead they put it in a flat pizza make oven.

naan gets 2 out of 5 stars

nutella naan is another joke. they charge $7 for a lousy naan with nutella spread.

nutella naan gets 2 out of 5 stars

peshawri chicken and rice combo probably was the best off the menu. it comes with 2 chicken legs, some rice or fries and salad and a naan bread.

peshawri chicken combo gets 3 out of 5 stars

in the end. it is an okay place for a quick lunch time snack but not as a family sit down place with a variety of dishes to pick from.

i would return back and try their grilled items."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews for everywhere I eat...that being said Aunty's kitchen is definitely worth it...very welcoming place...especially since we brought them some chaos tonight...came in with a party of 14...food came out quick...and we got a lot of attention from the waiting staff to make sure everything was right and if we needed anything. A lot of chain restaurants should take some notes from these youngsters!!

I ordered the kebab dinner...it was sooo delicious and mouth watering. I wanted to order half their menu. 

Presentation got an A++ and quantity was huge!! Very friendly staff.

Overall will be definitely going back to try more items."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my friend to make up for here birthday!

Its an order at the counter, take a number and seat type of restaurant. 

I went around 1pm on a Saturday and the crowds were just leaving. 

I ordered the multani chana with rice and salad. It came with naan. My friend ordered the butter chicken. 

The chana's flavor wasnt great, a bit bland as was the rice. The salad had a lot of red onions and pepper. The naan was fresh, thin and chewy which i enjoyed. 

I was disappointed... i had also ordered the nihari, butter chicken, biryani and daal to go when i first ordered. So wasnt super excited about dinner. 

I was proven wrong luckily, every dish was flavorful and delicious. Especially the Nihari, thw bf loved the butter chicken. Maybe it was just the chana that wasnt my cup of tea that day. 

Over all the service was quick and friendly. I would definitely go back and try some more dishes!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great customer service. I advise trying their Nihari Poutine and chicken shawarma. A next level business that has been doing very well."}
{"text":"I am going to completely agree with the other reviewer (Adnan). The place serves good food, but slightly on the bland and non-spicy side.

We had pindi-ribs, karachi kabob, daal, butter chicken poutine and chana plate, nothing was so good that i could write about but it wasn't bad either.

just a note that Karachi Kabab isn't from Karachi at all, these guys just named it after famous cities, same goes for pindi ribs.

They could do with increasing their menu size and upping their spice game, people come to ethnic food places to get a true experience of the local food not to eat westernized meals.

The service was amazing and that is something a bit hard to find in Pakistani Places, so they are going in the right direction."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a five star review being a first person to review it on yelp. However, I found the food nothing special. Little pricey for the quality and portions they offer. I liked the naan though and the customer service was very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Aunty's Kitchen is strictly ok. It's a casual dine in/take out restaurant and service is fairly quick and attentive. 
In terms of food my husband and I ordered the butter chicken combo and kabob combo. Let me preface by saying I am Indian, so I'm a little picky when it comes to Indian food. The rice and fries were good and so were the unlimited naan. They aren't as fluffy as typical restaurant naans, but they are tasty, fresh, and still have the right amount of chew (good texture) 
For me the butter chicken was fine. It was a bit mild for my tastes and the sauce was thinner then I prefer but it was acceptable. The kabobs too were a little more mild than my personal tastes."}
{"text":"An innovative concept of serving Indian n pak food ,
Quick service n not bad food !
Good for a Eco meal , though the taste factor their could improvise more .
Hire a Indian chef to exemplify the menu quality ."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here, Owner's are known Muslims. Came here for dinner with a group of 6 adults and 2 kids.  The food is very good and the staff is very friendly.  We tried the Nihari Poutine (pretty good), the Chicken Tikka Naan (good), the Paratha Rolls with Chicken (very good), the Fried Fish (good), the Islamabad Chicken Boti (OK)  and the Kheer (Not very sweet, but was good). They give you free naan if you dine in. Recommended if you want to try something different than the usual desi fare.  Modern interiors and very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Food: I had quite a lot of variety of food including naan (which is unlimited), poutine, butter chicken, chana (chickpeas), a BBQ platter and a Nutella naan dessert. The naan was really good. I thought they were soft, fluffy and unlike other traditional naans. They had a pizza dough consistency to them. This restaurant takes a lot of pride in their naans so it's featured in various ways. Another highlight was the naan with cheese on top. That was absolutely delicious. I would come back just for that. 

One of my two favourite dishes included the beef nahari poutine. The beef melted in my mouth and the fries were crispy and the perfect size. I found it to be on the slightly spicier side but really flavourful. My other standout was the chana. It was seasoned well and the chickpeas weren't mushy. 

The butter chicken was ok although I was slightly surprised that they used white meat. I  prefer dark meat with curries/gravies. I thought the BBQ platter was also good but personally, I'm more of a fan of dishes with gravies. By nature, the chicken breast cubes were kinda dry but very well seasoned and great when eaten with the cilantro sauce. 

I brought my husband a mango lassi and he said it was really good.

Service: Great! They were very attentive and made sure we were doing well. I really appreciated them asking us if we wanted more naan instead of us waiting to ask. 

Overall experience: I think it's a great addition here in the Streetsville/Churchill Meadows area. I would love to come back to have the cheesy naan and the poutine again. It's a great spin on a classic."}
{"text":"Love their nihari and unlimited naan is a plus. Great customer service made it 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place serves good food.  But that's just about it, the food is good but nothing extra-ordinary.

Owners are very professional and care deeply about customer satisfaction. That is something very hard to find in a Pakistani restaurant.

They present themselves as a fusion of eastern and western restaurant cuisine.  I figure that their food is not a true fusion. Unless they have new dishes on their menu, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the \"watered down\" South Asian restaurants I've been too, which for me is quite disappointing considering the hype that surrounds this place. I had a medley of items with my group from Nihari Poutine to an Oreo Naan/Pizza contraption. Most of my dishes were either bland or loaded with salt, for what reason? I don't know. Having been served this type of cuisine at home for the better part of my life, I know a thing or two about the South Asian cuisine and this place misses the mark by far. 

If it wasn't for the friendly service, I would've given this place a one star rating. However, your experience here might differ."}
{"text":"Auntys kitchen\", a pakistani restaurant located in a newly built plaza facing east near the intersection of erinmills and britania rd. Its a good family restaurant, friendly for kids. We have ordered butter chicken platter and chana masala platter, both are faar better than any other expensive indian restaurants. Their best thing is NAAN(baked bread) which is free or unlimited. Their platters comes with options of salad or fries. The best thing i liked about AUNTYS KITCHEN people is they care about all the customers very well. They will keep bringing you fresh naan and mint  chutney until you say no.
I will certainly go their again with my family.

Cons: washrooms need to be taken care more."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Pakistani food. They have a great lunch special. I got the kebab with butter chicken and rice and naan.  Really great food. I'm normally not a fan of butter chicken (which is often a non-spicy  tourist dish), but theirs taste so good and is actually flavorful and spicy. Their naan is also really good, it's so thin yet satisfying.  The staff are always super friendly as well. Great location as well, West of Heartland, near Erin Mills, near Streetsville, and near the business park. So it's at the center of it all. :-)"}
{"text":"Heard great things about the Waterloo location so I was looking forward to trying the Mississauga one. Cool interior, nice touch to give complimentary samosas, dates and juice to break fast in Ramadan. The food was nothing special, in fact I ordered I believe MSD or MSB wraps, and they were legit made of frozen parathas you can purchase at Walmart. $2 for a pack of $5. I paid about $9 for two wraps. The biryani was alright too, and unfortunately, they don't have the option to adjust (increase) the spice level, which is surprising for a restaurant as everything is made in house. I still want to give this place another shot, perhaps try the nutella naan. Prices do seem to be on the higher end for a newly opened place, not as popular as the Waterloo branch."}
{"text":"This is my second trip to Aunty's Kitchen.

I was not disappointed on either trip.

Aunty's Kitchen serves Pakistani cuisine with their own twist.

The staff is very friendly and very attentive to my needs.  The prices were very good and the serving sizes were good as well.

I must eat gluten free, and the staff was able to help me get the right food, and to make sure that the food was safe for me to eat.

I had the Karachi kebabs, tandoori chicken, and the Chana.  The flavours were very good.  

The meats were very juicy and the coriander chutney they served was out of this world.

I also bought some Naans with me for another friend who got excited when he heard that I was going.

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the fusion recipes especially Nihari Poutine. Wish they had a restaurant in San Francisco / Bay-area."}
{"text":"Going in felt nice and welcomed.
Food was OK.
Nihari Poutine had a heavier than usual amount of salt with the extra chaat masala on the fries.
Cheese Naan basically tasted like Manakeesh
Butter Chicken was a little runny than the usual creamy texture. 
Barbecue was probably the best feature as there was a lot of good variety.
There was no kheer due to time constraints but a lot of people were looking forward to it.
The owners are really nice.
The waterloo location has better tasting food for some reason but that's probably because where I started enjoying their fresh food. I feel like they are trying too hard with different varieties"}
{"text":"Please do not eat here. The food we received was old and stale. The rice grains were all dried up because the food was sitting out for that long. There was nothing enjoyable about the meal we had. We expressed these concerns to management and left quickly. Very over rated."}
{"text":"I'm not very well-versed in Pakistani food, but I found the food here flavourful and the portions generous, though it could've used a tad more spice. I think they're going for a Nando's-type feel, with the exception that you pay after you eat. We ordered the tandoori chicken (side of fries) and the beef kebab (salad), which were both good. The seasoning on the fried was surprisingly good, and the meat themselves still juicy. Naan was unlimited, which was a nice plus. The sauces were also nice, and gave a good kick to the food. Hope to be back!"}
{"text":"My husband kept telling me that we have to try this new place, we were tired driving back after the long weekend so picked up food to go. Ordered beef nan kebab and chicken biryani.  When we sat to eat, they had given us a wrap with sauce and cucumber and carrots cut in cubes  the cucumber was ok but carrots were like jaw breakers. Anyways , there was no nan in it, it was a paratha roll, na!  didn't like it, the biryani was okay."}
{"text":"I originally had Auntys Kitchen in their Waterloo location where the butter chicken dinner was $11. In this location the lunch menu has the butter chicken for $10 including a drink but a very small portion of actual chicken. The dinner portion will run you $14 before taxes. Although I enjoy the butter chicken, $14 is a bit of a stretch for this type of food. The environment is brand new so it is nice and the service is good. Quality of food is good but the prices are too expensive for what it is. 

I would come back only for a butter chicken fix but can't see this being my goto joint as there are places in Mississauga for butter chicken at half the price."}
{"text":"Amazing food, delicious variety of contemporary and authentic South Asian dishes including rices, kabobs, ribs, butter chicken, naan breads and desserts. I had a variety of meats and my favourite was the spare ribs, very succulent and BBQ just right. The knobs are on the spicer end, but delicious and very filling. The butter chicken is made with whole chunks of white chicken meat with a sauce that is not too thick and pasty, but succulent with naan bread. I did t enjoy the Nutella naan bread all that much for dessert, but that's my taste. Great dipping sauces are readily available and refilled by the waitress at all times. Unlimited naan bread can be dangerous because it's highly addictive but a great choice when dipping sauces are unlimited and the butter chicken bowl is massive. I would definitely recommend this place to friends. It is a very unique restaurant and I love their contemporary feel. 5/5"}
{"text":"Good food, inflated prices and horrible service! 
I have been to this place three times already to try out different things on the menu. 

The chicken wrap with fries inside was yummy. The naan was fresh, warm and thin which was super easy to chew and swallow. There was a generous amount of mayo and chicken in it which was well cooked. I just wish they added more fries inside the wrap because mine had no more than 4 fries! 

The service is horrible. Between placing your order, getting served and finishing your food the server does not come check in even once. If you are starving then don't come here because your food will take 30 mins even though they will tell you that it's gonna take no longer than 15 mins. The food is over priced as well because living in Mississauga you probably know that there are cheaper options for equally good food."}
{"text":"Been here today for dinner with my wife and a friend of mine . Brand new place , looks neat and the ambience was good with some fancy wood work done as interiors . To start with comments about ordering, they don't take orders at the table , instead ask u to order at the counter and then bring the food to ur table , the person who took the order has minimal knowledge on the food being served there , there are not many options for gravy other than the butter chicken and nihari and for a Pakistani place , they got the nihari wrong. It was not spicy at all and the taste of the gravy was just ok . Meat was well cooked . They probably had butter chicken to attract the non spicy friends and they got it wrong, the chicken pieces were too big and the gravy was probably from a bottle of butter chicken masala . The best part was the Karachi kabob which was made just right. Juicy and tender and the right spice levels , my friend ordered a tandoori chicken and he complains it was bland . They have unlimited servings of naan  coming , I was too hungry and lost count of the number of naan I had tonight . The naan was not that great but okish , would like to visit some other time to try their nihari poutine which the person who was working there told me it's a big hit and so is their kabob. They should probably stick to making more of kabob items to to make it stay in a place like Mississauga where we have enough to Pakistani joints. Inould visit again to try all their other kabob items and the wraps .

Was too hungry and could not take and pics while eating , they gave a free pudding of u check in on Facebook"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dining experience at Aunty's kitchen. The portion sizes are big and their naan is really good!! I shared the butter chicken with a friend and it was enough to fill the both of us. The butter chicken was good, not the best but it was up there. The restaurant was spacious and our host/server was amazing! She was so helpful and patient with us when we were struggling to decide what to get. She was able to help us out and did her best to make sure that we were comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you are looking for a space to eat with a larger group."}
{"text":"I'd give more than 5 stars if I could. I've only been here once and it's new but it's great. Bright and fun atmosphere. Delicious food. Unlimited Naan. Worth repeating: unlimited Naan! And it's fabulous. I had Butter Chicken and it was a tad spicy for me but it was delicious! The rice was great. The salad was good. 

So I was with kids and the food was a bit spicy for them too. A man who I think was an owner or management was instantly helpful, he brought a big bowl of extra rice at no charge, he brought us a carafe of water. He brought garlic sauce and he spent time talking to the kids, telling them they were brave for trying the food and encouraging them to use the garlic sauce to cut the spice.

He was friendly and full of smiles and very interested in interacting with patrons.

For the service alone I would come back here but the food is great so it's a no brainer.

I love supporting new businesses but this rave review is honest and is driven simply by the fact that the gentleman I am referring to went out of his way to make things good for the kids and that is service you just can't beat.

Well done! I wish I knew your name, but thank you!"}
