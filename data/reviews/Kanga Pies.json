{"text":"Buttery, flaky pies. Butter chix (butter chicken) is my go to pie here. Enough for a small lunch when you're not that hungry. Freezer to the right has frozen unbaked pies that you can take home at a discount. 

The woman who works here is a bit surly and doesn't seem like she wants to be there.

Also please note that the map location is WRONG. I already reported it but apparently they couldn't confirm it. This 199 Bay location is at Bay and King, in the PATH."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, my friend and I were hungry. We ordered the butter chix and a cheddar chive scone, as the price for one pie was pretty pricey ($6.85). The pie itself is about maybe 3.5 inches wide. 

Crust was on point, filling was great  All butter crust, and being a baker, I know how important it is to nail the crust.

Scone was a little lack luster, they also didn't have anything to warm it up for us. 

Filling was good - not too rich and just the right amount.

The only thing I would maybe adjust is the prices ($$) $6.85 is too much to charge for a personal sized pie IMO.

Good, I'd like to come back and try the traditional meat pie."}
{"text":"I was hungrily walking around and noticed a sign for Kanga pies... I'll admit I was initially interested in possibly eating a kangaroo meat pie. 
Ultimately I went in and stuck to the vegetarian offerings they had. I ordered the creamy zucchini pie and in all honesty... I devoured it quickly because it was so incredibly delicious. 
The flakey buttery exterior was ideal and the filling was full of flavour and top notch seasoning. 

I would gladly eat another pie this instant! The only thing holding me back from seconds (and my five star rating) is the slightly expensive price for the sort of small pies."}
{"text":"REALLY impressed with the flakiness of the crust throughout the entire duration of my meal. 

The MASALA pie was described with a spicy warning but no heat was detectable for me. The chickpeas and eggplant were tasty though. Not terribly saucy/soggy so it was akin to a massivo fusion samosa

The TRADITIONAL AUSSIE was well seasoned and although ground meat, some pieces of meat were quite chunky and toothsome. Well seasoned and enjoyable but perhaps forgettable. 

The kanga box is $10.50 and comes with a pie + small roll (sausage rolls or spinach and cheese roll) + simple salad, mashed potatoes, or mushy peas. The simple salad is straight up just spinach and dressing but offers a balance to all the butteriness of the pie crust. 

Just because of the heaviness and pretty priciness I don't see myself having it all that often but def a diff option for lunch in the financial district."}
{"text":"Delicious comfort food. Have had a few of the pies, and all of them satisfied my cravings."}
{"text":"I popped in this little shop in commerce court out of pure curiosity, no offence to my Aussie brothers and sisters, but it's not a common occurrence to see a food shop devoted to Australian food. To be honest, beyond Vegemite. i didn't know much else about Australian food, nor did i think it would be any different than north american food. 

This place however, specializes in Aussie meat pies, the guy behind the counter suggested the Canadian style pie, and i also bought the Kiwi (New Zealander) pie, i have to say they were pretty damn great, the pastry was flaky, crispy and buttery, and the filling was superb, the Kiwi pie had minced meat and cheddar. and the canadian had big chunks of steak, canadian bacon and some veggies. The guy behind the counter was absolutely right, the canadian was AWESOME!! 

These pies are definitely worth trying. However a little on the expensive side for such a small pie ($6.85) as 1 is a snack size and 2 could be a small meal. Really $4.50 to $5.00 would be more reasonable, this could prove challenging for this business in the long run with this high price point, definitely over valued. I would safely bet that they could do better business with a lower price point. But i digress.. Overall i was really pleasantly surprised at how good these pies are, they are quite delicious. They also sell them uncooked so you can take them home and make them later or freeze them. I will definitely be returning to try the other meat pies they have, well except the zucchini one, because, well it's Zucchini and  we just don't get along... They use high quality ingredients as well, including delicious sausages from Sanagan's in their sausage rolls. I highly suggest trying this place out, Unique and delicious :)"}
{"text":"This one's located in Commerce Court. One of them...east, west, north...I don't know it's pretty confusing down there for those that don't go frequently.

Pies are served hot. Flaky crust. Lots of filling.
You can also buy frozen pies home to pop into the oven yourself to consume at your own convenience.

I ordered a chicken pie and it came with nice chunks of tender chicken with various vegetables.

At $7 a pie though, I think it would be better if the pie was larger since it's not enough unless you're just looking for a snack. They have end-of-day special at this commerce court location half an hour before it closes where you can get $5 a pie."}
{"text":"Glad Kanga is now available right in the PATH, making it a good lunch idea. Their Australian meat pies are small portioned, and filled with delectable minced beef/chicken/veggie in many gravies/sauces and may also include cheese (e.g. the Kiwi Classic). Prices are high for such a small pie but the quality is good with a flaky crust made using real butter.

They do have a combo deal which is $10.50 for a meat pie, a small sausage or spinach roll, and a side. Compared to buying the three individually, you save a few bucks and would be full compared to buying just a pie. Buying a meat pie alone is more like a snack, especially since the filling could do with more meat (but hard considering the pastry is already small).

Will be back."}
{"text":"It is at the food court of equinox building. Size is pretty small for that price ($7+ after tax). I had the chicken pie, 2 pieces of chicken, few peas and diced carrot. It is flavourful. I probably won't come back!"}
{"text":"For some reason, before I actually looked into it, I thought these pies were full of kangaroo meat (I know... d'oh!). Newsflash: they're not. Kanga has a variety of pie options you can pick from, with various filling types. Located in the heart of Commerce Court (at the edge of the Commerce Court Food Court), I've stopped by a couple of times and I've had the Canadian (Steak and Bacon) Pie, Pepper Steak Pie, the Spinach Roll, and the Sausage Roll.

The pie crust is fresh and flaky, and not too oily, which is great. Out of everything I've tried so far, I enjoyed the Canadian (Steak and Bacon) best. Flavourful meat, flaky pastry crust - a good combination. I thought the Spinach Roll was okay, but I wouldn't get the Sausage Roll again (the meat was a bit bland).

Overall, I think you'll find more hits than misses at this place, which is a good thing. They also have lunch specials that come with salads, if you wish. If you come often, you can also take advantage and get a stamp card (for every X number of pies you purchase, you get something free!). Service is also really friendly - I'd come back again!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite lunch spot! The lunch boxes are a great option for a satisfying lunch and afternoon snack. The box includes a pie (zucchini is my fav), salad option (get the Australian) and snack size sausage or spinach roll.
Love that they are now open late for dinner!"}
{"text":"Located at the Commerce Court foodcourt, Kanga offers a decent selection of savoury pies. I tried the original, but in my opinion I think the chicken pot pie is the best! They have a combo available for a pie, salad and sausage roll. I usually just get the pie alone as that fills me up enough for lunch!"}
{"text":"4 for pies, 2 for value
The moment you walk buy, the store is fragrant with buttery goodness.
They have really good pies, pie crust are nice and flakey. Chicken pie filling should be what all chicken pies aim to be: chicken chunks are moist with a good mix of veggies; just enough sauce to soften pieces of the crust but not make the whole thing soupy. I also tried the minced meat one, it was still tasty, but completely eclipsed by its chicken counterpart. 
A huge complaint on the size of these delicious pies, any adult cannot possibly be filled by a baby pie the size of a palm - an effin tiny Asian lady's palm! What portion size are they used to eating in the down under? And the audacity for they to charge a cheap McDs value meal for this little food?
\"Simple salad\" was miserable, basically a store bought spring mix with olive oil and balsamic. Their meals come with sausage rolls / spinach & feta rolls, which are decent too...still ain't filling tho."}
