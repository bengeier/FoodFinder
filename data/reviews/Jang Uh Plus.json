{"text":"Overcast, Light drizzle.  Seafood Sujebi($8.95)  T&T closing shop near 10 pm.   Alternative Food solution needed. Jang Uh Plus 11 pm close.   Decision finalized.  Banchans served at time of 1st Main hitting the table??? That Main took extended period of time as subsequent dishes followed. Banchan wait-time was excruciating.  The question is why the wait?  Seafood Pancake.............. Chicken Bulgogi... Chicken Teriyaki.............................. Cat Fish Sujebi... Seafood Sujebi.  Family run meant patience is required.  Dishes come one after another. The 6 dishes were served in 3 to 4 burst as indicated above. The ideal situation would be eating with Family and sharing all dishes. Unfortunately we are not Family, once again I chugged my Meal to compensate.  Seafood Sujebi($8.95)                -------- I saw it under the Noodles section and just went with it, whatever it might be.  It happens to be a form of Handtorn Dough Flakes.  Nice density that give it the right bite.  Every Flake was unique like a snowflake.    The Seafood was the Korean-style miniature Seafood bites commonly found.  Broth had more DEPTH than Beef Broth.  I might have tasted Shellfish in the Broth.  Sodium from the Kelp in the Broth?                -------- Can Pop($1.00) or Cold Tea/Water(Free)"}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place as I was shopping in T & T for some groceries.  When I walked in the place was empty and one other couple sat down at the same time.  The placemat on the table pleasantly was their review from Toronto life which I read before my dinner came out.  For their banchan they had 4 nice dishes (one radish with light red pepper flavour, one sprouts, one pasta and potato salad with a light banana taste, one bean curd?)  all were pleasant with different fresh flavors.  I asked the woman (owners wife) if it would be too much if I ordered the Japchae and a Bibimbap.  She said lots of food.  I ordered it anyway.  It came out and smaller portions than other Korean restaurants I've been to but had excellent taste and presentation.  I'd definitely go back!  Very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"It is not easy to locate Jang Uh Plus since it is hidden in the corner at the plaza on Yonge just south of Weldrick. There are no English name for this place in the advertisement my friend shown to me in a Chinese Newsapaper and there of course no Chinese name... Just 2 Korean word Plus...the map on the ad is not too helpful showing it as North of Weldrick!!  The only Chinese characters you will find are at the outside of the store prompting their BBQ Eel which is their speciality. Jang Uh Plus is runned by a Korean family, fortunately the owner speaks English well so I have no problem when I try to order. There are few English words in the menu itself but for the Combo Specials they are only in Korean.. funny thing is the word Soju kept popping up in their one page menu on their placemat and the wall..  They do order Lunch specials, which are $2 or so cheaper from 12-4 pm. I settle on the BBQ Eel + Dongchimi ($12.95). I don't know what is Dongchimi but I find out from the server is cold noodle soup.. that is perfect for me!  The order took 20 min to arrive! I was the first one that came in the restaurant and it was empty.. so it took that long for them to prepare my BBQ eel.. so don't come here if you in a rush!  The free appetitzer is deep fried fish.. normally I won't eat that since it is really a whole bait fish that deep fried without removing their heads and gut..and it can taste really fishy..but I ate both of them..they are pretty good to my surprise.  The BBQ eel is bbq until the skin is nice and crisp and brushed with hot sauce. It is a little bit spicy so if you cannot eat spicy ask them to take it easy on the hot sauce. The server explain to me that  Lettuce, shiso leaf, fresh garlic and ginger are on the side are for wrapping up the eel to eat it like a wrap. I usually hate eating fish skin because I find them fishy and I hate the texture.. but I love how their eel's skin here is so crispy, a little burnt.. and a little spicy!  The cold noodle tasted ok... not the best but I think I will order the EEl with rice instead. Or try one of their combo with Soju if I find out what their combos are!! :)  They accepts Visa and Mastercard!"}
