{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic!! The owner, Sue, treats you as if you are long lost family, even if she just met you. Her husband and co-owner, Jim, is an excellent chef. His food is consistently delicious. Everything is homemade. There is lots of variety, unique offerings such as banana bread French toast which is heavenly, quality is top notch and they are willing to go beyond to ensure you have a great experience. The servers are fast and friendly and coffee refills are quick and plentiful. Be prepared for a line-up on the weekends, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Prices have been raised and amount of food has been reduced. We won't be back.

Original Review: The absolute best breakfast I've had at a restaurant in years. I haven't been here since it was Flapjack's and was hesitant as my last visit wasn't good. The new owners have totally improved the place. Good food and value for your money. My only comment would be that the interior needs a complete overhaul, but still, great place."}
