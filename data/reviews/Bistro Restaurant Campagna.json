{"text":"Worth the drive if you're not in the area! I've been 3 times and each time is better than the last. I partial to the lamb, but my husband loves their fish. We both love their desserts!! the ambiance is great and the host and staff are attentive. Delicious food and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars but last month's visit was by far the best......soup, veal carpaccio, guinea foul for me and fish for him and we were in heaven. I believe these items are not on the regular menu and were specials for the week but if you have a chance to try, please do so. Service is always pretty slow so not recommended if you are in a time crunch but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Very good Italian restaurant. Homemade ham was amazing. Pasta cooked al dente and steak was tender."}
{"text":"When the second time is as good as the first time, you know what they say! This one is a keeper!   It was my second time at Campagna yesterday and though the service was a little long specifically due to my Risotto order (and they had informed me it would take 30 min), the wait was absolutely worth it!  From what I heard, everything is done from scratch in the kitchen!  First time was for lunch and yesterday was for diner. The ambiance is perfect at anytime of the day. Cozy, green looking and to the sound of classical jazz hits, this little bistro is the perfect spot to indulge in fine dining and wining without having to drive and park in Montreal.   ---  Quand la deuxième fois est aussi bonne que la première, vous savez ce qu'ils disent! Celui-ci on le garde!   C'était ma 2e expérience chez Campagna, hier et quoique le service fût long spécifiquement dû à ma commande de Risooto (et on m'avait averti d'avance que cela prenait plus de temps), l'attente en valait la peine!  De ce qu'on m'a dit, tout est fait fraîchement sur place!  La première fois j'y étais pour diner et la seconde pour souper. L'ambiance est parfaite à toute heure du jour. Chaleureux, au look vert et sous le son de succès jazz, ce petit bistro est l'endroit parfait pour de la cuisine raffinée et du bon vin, sans avoir à conduire et stationner à Montréal!"}
{"text":"I hesitate between 3 stars and 4 but I'll round up seeing as I'm willing to go back. This is definitely one of the nicer restaurants in the area. The ambiance is really lovely and romantic and chic. The food is hit or miss. My squash soup was very tasty but my linguini with pine nuts was a bit dry and weird. My boyfriend's bison, on the other hand, was excellent. The service is pretty slow - we went on a Thursday night when it wasn't terribly crowded. If you're not in a rush, it's a nice spot and you could luck out with one of the better tasting dishes. I'd definitely give them another try."}
