{"text":"Good spot, walking distance. Salad is great as I make it with all the things i prefer. Very good variety, clean and quite."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Really stepped up their game from last semester when the quality and variation of items to put on your salad were lacking. Now they have chia seed yogurt, flax seeds, etc!"}
{"text":"This place does not impress... but I wish that it did! Sometimes all I want is a salad, but not a $15 one that I have to put together myself. The meat looks... weird. It's always empty. I would rather get a snack at Starbucks next door. I agree with the other review that the quality is not that great."}
{"text":"I got the pre-made sushi and it was not good at all. I haven't tried their salad bar so no comment on that but I'm definitely never getting sushi there again."}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot! Essentially a glorified salad bar, where you assemble your lunch with as many ingredients as your heart desires. The salad possibilities here are endless! From fresh fruits and veggies, to nuts and seeds, garbanzo beans, meats, cheeses, dressings... you really can't go wrong. 

To top it all off, it's very affordable! You can get a huge salad with unlimited toppings for about $7. Compared to the other restaurants in the area, this is a steal for a healthy, fresh, nutritious lunch. It's very fast too, which is important if you're grabbing a bite to eat in between classes or on your work lunch break.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is now marketplace.   Salad was good but wish there were some low-fat dressing available. Thanks for not charging me extra for the 2 proteins though!"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at that place and I believe it gives a great value for your $7.00 - huge salad, regardless of weight. I don't know if it is a regular assortment, but there was a decent selection of greens, grilled veggies, beans, sprouts, and variety of hummus. Sushi did not look particularly appetizing, but you do not go to a salad bar for the sushi, right?"}
{"text":"This is my new fav lunch spot! Oh em geeeee!

I almost didn't come because I noticed the low rating (1.5 stars/3 reviews), but I am SO happy I checked it out for myself.  I'm new to the area, so maybe something serious changed? (management, menu, style?)

So there's 2 main sides - salad bar and sushi. I got salad - $6.99 for a plate! No weighing! Whatever you want on a plate for $6.99!!!! And I loved the options: garbanzo beans, edamame, beets, grilled veggies, house made hummus, etc. etc.  YUM  Plus they have some very affordable daily specials with soup/salad/drink.

TWO THUMBS UP."}
{"text":"Brought to you by the contractors that run the dining hall and Starbucks on the ASU downtown campus, Aramark.  Apparently they are also open until 1am 6 days a week too....hummm.....

Stopping in on my way home from work hoping to find some veggies.  On first glance through the place I was excited, thinking, \"cool my own salad bar near home.\" Then as I  took a closer look...the quality of said veggies, well that was another story.

The employees probably never eat salad or veggies by the look of the dry wilted zucchini, cucumbers, celery, carrots, bok choy...
To their credit the main piles of spinach, romaine and mixed greens were fresh.  The side salads looked like they had been sitting out all day as did the dressings.  
Either cover the items, take the time to stir the salads/dressings, or put out less and replenish frequently.  All of this could be resolved with a swift kick to the ass of some obviously lazy employees. 

I wanted to take my salad to go and they charge by weight but I was not given a to go container.   I was told to use a plate, put it all together and then I had to dump it in to a container after it was weighed.  HUH?!  

These plates are huge and plastic, and I doubt that they tare out the weight of the plate.  I didn't get a whole lot of salad considering the quality of the toppings and it came to $9.  WTF?! I can get the whole kit and caboodle at Souper Salad or even Sweet Tomato for that price (or less).  I rarely even pay that price at Whole Foods when carrying out a salad there.  

No wonder this place was empty....

I wish this place was better...."}
