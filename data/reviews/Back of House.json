{"text":"dropped by tonight (saturday) around 7:30 and only one other table was busy.  Cool place to look at.  Only the chef as staff.  He had a limited menu and no license however we chose from what he had.  Food was really quite spectacular.   I had the 18 hour cooked pork shoulder and thick cut fries.  Companion had the steak sandwich.   We kept stealing bites of each other's food - as it was so good.  Prices were beyond reasonable.   This place is definitely an overlooked gem.  Hopefully, the clientele will grow - I really don't understand why it's not packed - I'm assuming the LLBO license has a lot to do with it but seems crazy to me.  This place needs to flourish.  Would have given 5 star for value if they had LLBO license."}
{"text":"Went back today, Charlie had already closed but was sweet enough to offer to cook for us supper anyway. He apologized for not having everything available, and then proceeded to feed us a delicious chicken and pork belly sandwich with tomatoes, hot sauce, caramelized onions and those tasty fries. My salad was beets, goat cheese, mushrooms, pickled onion, blueberries. It was an amazing amalgamation of different menu items.  We had such a great time, and incredibly appreciative that he took the time to feed us. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect from the reviews, but from  the minute i walked in i knew i liked the place. The chef was very polite and took pride in his work. He explained any questions we had on the food and even gave us a sample of his homemade ice cream, which was amazing. As for the main course, we had the chicken and steak sandwiches. Short of writing an essay of the flavors, i will sum it up with delicious and a recommendation to go back for my next dinner. The fries were awesome too and had no need for ketchup to ruin the spices."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken and steak sandwiches with a side salad and soup....all amazing! If you like eating well-crafted, delicious, honest food while supporting a hard working young chef then this is the place for us both! I truely hope they get their liquor license,  it will be the best bet for this place to succeed financially."}
{"text":"I don't know what to think about this place.  It has potential but it fails. Of the 5 times we tried to go it was open only once. And we tried to go at the standard times i.e. Friday and Saturday evening or Saturday / Sunday brunch. Sometimes it is open at these times, other days it mysteriously wasn't.  When we did go the restaurant was cold. We were the only ones there and whilst that isn't a bit issue the atmosphere was weird. And for being the only guests the service was lackluster to say the least.  There were only 3 things on the menu: burger, chicken sandwich and mac n cheese. My girlfriend had had the burger before and loved it so I tried it. It was over cooked, tiny, lacking flavour and very underwhelming. I'm a bit of a burger fanboi having tried some of the best burgers (based on award winning) in TO, and this didn't come close to them.  I see the other reviews on here are much better but I am surprised. I don't think I'll go back. But I hope they do well."}
{"text":"Great burgers, friendly staff in an intimate space. We were there shortly after they opened on a Saturday (around 3pm). They weren't quite ready for us, but they got us great burgers and Caesar salad quickly. I would go back again."}
{"text":"So... This place has truly wonderful food, and the two young guys running the place seem to have their hearts in the right place. So I say this with the spirit of encouragement. Guys - you have to up your game in the service dept. We arrived, sat around for quite a while (the place was almost empty) before one of the guys came over to announce the offerings. No menu; the southern fried chicken offered on the board we were now told was no longer; and he began to walk away without asking about a drink order. So we asked about beverages. The answer: no licence (which is fine -they're fairly new). Water only.  How about a juice? Soft drink? Lemonade?  When dinner came it was sublime. These boys know how to cook. But then, dinner ended. The place was now empty except for us. The plates on the table sat. And sat. And then, we finally hollered across the room for the cheque.  Again. GREAT food; good intentions all the way around. This should be a roaring successful spot. It just needs a lot more attention to service."}
{"text":"Charlie and the gang serve up exceptional food at this comfy Leslieville spot. High quality food at reasonable prices. Why go anywhere else?!? I have been there three times now and plan to go back many times over! I can confidently recommend their breakfast dish of pork belly, sous vide eggs and kale, their ground chuck and ox tail burger, and their fried chicken sandwich. I urge you to support this local business - it's sure to excite your taste buds and fill your bellies!"}
{"text":"After hearing the chef's story on CBC radio, I knew I needed to plan a visit. I was impressed that the people of Leslieville cared enough and rallied together to keep this restaurant alive.   I was not disappointed. The chef personally greeted us and went on to explain in detail the items on the menu. Through his description, his passion for his craft showed. He described the food as if each item on the menu was a work of art. I was excited about the food before it even came to my plate! I ordered the Chicken Wonder sandwich and it was divine. The chicken was soaked in buttermilk before it was grilled and was deliciously tender. The flavours seemed to blend together perfectly. He even let us try his homemade ice cream.   I would recommend this place for anyone who truly appreciates food and the time in goes into creating a quality dish."}
{"text":"We were lucky to go once. And the food was amazing. I will go anywhere Charlie is the chef.. Wish it was still there but THAT location although close to Queen I think was death by location, just  few steps away.."}
{"text":"Leslieville's hidden gem. Delicious food made and served by a true artist we go is committed to doing things differently. Prices are beyond reasonable. Service is authentic."}
{"text":"We just finished our meal. Extremely tasty, and considerate of my gluten allergy. I'm always impressed when a chef is so accommodating to an allergy. Will try to come back as often as I can.   Eat the pork belly!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Perfecto!  The food was amazing!   Excellent depth of flavour, flavour combination, combined with quality ingredients and executed very well.  Outstanding meal.    Friendly service.  It did take some time for the meal to arrive at some tables, though the chef noted that too.  But the amazing food was well worth the wait.  Will certainly repeat, and often!!!"}
{"text":"Came in and the place was empty. The chef was currently mopping the floor and I asked if it was even open.   He told us they were open but only on had a limited menu - breakfast only. Since this is what we were looking for, we stayed.    He made us some French pressed coffee and stepped out to grab some tomatoes. He put on some tunes and left the shop. He came back and told us we'd be fed within 10 minutes. Sure enough,  withing 10 minutes we had breakfast!  Honestly, one of the best breakfasts I've ever had! The pork belly was cooked perfectly and slightly sweet. The eggs were like butter.   The chef asked if we wanted home fries, we said yes and within a few minutes we had a hot crispy bowl of delicious home fries."}
{"text":"Back of House is closed. It's sad, but was probably inevitable. Charlie is a terrific cook, but doesn't seem to have any of the skills needed to run any type of business. I was gobsmacked by the number of people who gave him encouragement, help, and even money, but discipline needs to come from within. I will miss this place."}
