{"text":"My husband and I had an overnight layover in Phoenix and happended on the Rodehouse Restaurant. Sierra, the bartender was so much fun to talk with, gave great service and made fantastic drinks! The restaurant is a bit outdated but has good food. We come by again if we are in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Cold mushy in the center burnt on the outside hash browns. Not enough gravy to hide the fact the country fried steak was burnt. The eggs looked ok.  I paid for it and I shouldn't have . I just know not to ever stop there again.  Pretty pricey for not trying."}
{"text":"Whenever I want to go have a nice sit down lunch this is my absolute favorite. Although it isnt much to look at from the outside, its very comfortable on the inside. The food is so fresh. The waitresses are very prompt. We always take our clients here. If you are near the Airport and want to have an awesome lunch business or otherwise this is the place!"}
{"text":"Super casual spot with great food and amazing service. Axel was so friendly and treated me like family! No slacking here; the place is always spotless and they take great care of you, plus the super melt is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Last summer, to kick off a west coast road trip, my family and I flew out to Phoenix, where our trip would commence. We arrived in Phoenix at around 9:30 am local time, and by the time we picked up our luggage and rental car, it was almost 11 am. Since we flew over from the east coast and had not eaten since early that morning, we were ridiculously hungry. However, that day also happened to be the day of the highly anticipated US-England World Cup soccer match, so we also wanted to watch the game. In need of a site with food and televisions, we decided to look for a sports bar or pub. But I guess just about everyone in Phoenix wanted to watch the soccer game at a bar, too, because all of the sports bars that we passed by were full. Who knew that Arizonans (or Americans, for that matter) followed soccer? Anyway, long story short, our search kept turning up duds until our GPS navigated us to Rodehouse Restaurant. The nearly empty restaurant, large televisions, and our groaning stomachs all conspired to pull us into the restaurant. My jubilation at finally getting a chance to sit down and eat quickly vanished when I noticed that, though the game was not even 10 minutes old at that point, England was already up 1-0. Sigh.  Anyway, about the restaurant: we ordered a couple of burgers and salads. The Cobb salad was actually pretty large and substantial, containing a good amount of chicken, egg, avocado, bacon, and cheese. The chili cheeseburger, a behemoth of a burger, was tasty, as the thick, hearty chili definitely hit the spot. Messy, but damn tasty. Oh, and the Tavern Fries (I think that's what they were called) served with the burgers were good as well. All in all, the food was solid, but nothing blew my mind away.   We stayed for the duration of the game, giving a large whoop when the US tied game on Dempsey's goal courtesy of the English keeper's gaffe. The waiter was nice and didn't mind that my family and I lingered at the restaurant for the length of the game, long after we had finished our meals, so props for that. The Rodehouse Restaurant is not particularly special, but it more than served its purpose as a place where we could watch the game and get some good grub."}
{"text":"This had to be the best hole in the wall in Phoenix. This quickly became our go to place when we are looking for a place to hang out after work. It's close to work, comfortable and the perfect noise level to enjoy the people we are with.    The prices are fantastic, especially at happy hour. The staff are typically very attentive and always have a great attitude. This place is the closest I have found to the small town bars where I am from. You won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was a good experience. It wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. The waitress was nice and luckily when we sat down we Knew what we wanted they had a sign up for their specials.  I ordered the French toast with egg and bacon. The eggs were an ihop style but the ready was not it was good.  This place is good and I will be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for breakfast.  We won't be back again.  It wasn't bad it just was nothing special.  It has been around forever, the waitress was efficient but no smiles.  The decor is very 70's and never updated.  The price is average."}
{"text":"The food was terrible, the selection was very limited and the service was pretty mediocre. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Best Western where this place is located.  We ate here because it was convenient. The staff was friendly and provided good service.  The burgers were good."}
{"text":"This place is near my work, so I've eaten here more times than I probably should have. The two stars are a reflection of the value.  Lack of bang for your buck will be a recurring theme in this review.  Environment-  Nice enough. For a restaurant that consistently has a moderate crowd, they do a great job of keeping the tables clean. The lighting on the restaurant side is poor, so they lose points there. The menus have been dirty on occasion. I'm not a fan of handling a dirty menu right before I eat.  3 out of 5 stars.  Service- The service on the restaurant side has always been outstanding for me. The bar side is another story. If you're stopping by the bar for a to go order, the quality of service is a coin flip. One waitress in particular is brusque, inattentive and always seems annoyed that she has to work because of you. This is one of the few places I have ever not tipped my server. That said, the service on the restaurant side is good enough to warrant 4 out of 5 stars.  Tastiness- Good, but not good enough. Actually, it's kind of bland. Given the cost, this food's really not worth it. It's better than fast food, obviously, but I'd expect that of any sit down restaurant. The burgers are about $12 to $15 a pop. I don't mind spending $15 for a burger and side, but I expect to get a burger worth $15. I'd value these at $8 to $10. Then there's the taco salad, which is is all lettuce and very little meat, cheese or beans. I've had soup and sandwiches here, but they were forgettable enough that I can't think of anything to say about them. Again, very poor value. Lastly, never get the coleslaw. I did once, and it smelled like an E. coli infection just waiting to happen. 2.5 out of 5 stars. The Smashburger up on Baseline would give you much better value if you're looking for a quick meal. If you're looking for a place to get dinner and drinks, head towards Downtown or to Tempe/Scottsdale.  $-  1 star out of 5. It's not going to break the bank, but this food is just not worth the price tag. If you're going during happy hour, however, then it is. I'd give it a 3.5 star review if I could stipulate that it's for happy hour only (and if I could give out half stars). During unhappy hours, your money will be better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside the Best Western Phoenix Airport Hotel. Sierra was our server and she was super nice and a great server.  Breakfast is from 7am to 11am and from 11am to 9pm they offer appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, salads, desserts and a handful of items under \"other\". Everything we ordered was very good. The atmosphere in the restaurant/lounge is very comfortable; bar, booths, tables, chairs and plenty of TVs. I had a Bloody Mary that was good. Chicken noodle soup was good. Wings and the bleu cheese was excellent. Rodehouse burger was excellent as well as the \"tavern chips\" it came with. Julienne salad was huge and excellent. The ranch dressing was excellent too. Apple pie with vanilla ice cream excellent. Hope to return before we leave the hotel."}
{"text":"I had the beef dip sandwich and had to send it back it was awful. The server was really nice about it and suggested trying the avocado blt as it wouldn't take long to come out. It was ok, I mean it's a BLT. The service was great and my friend had the Cobb salad which was huge."}
{"text":"Excellent source of red meat!They know how to cook it right on the boan. They keep it tender & juicy! Its always seasoned to protecting! The staff is amazing at what they do,getting all those plates prepared and perfect. It looks like a tuff job,I have respect for them for that! It makes me feel good to tip them. I feel good when I eat here,it makes me happy!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time was an after work beer, the second was for lunch. The staff is niceba quick. They have the best onion rings and chili I've had in the valley!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had our flight cancelled. The airline recommended  the Best Western, when we arrived we noticed that the RodeHouse was attached  to the hotel. We went down to get a drink and Sierra the bartender was awesome, she greeted us  like she new us. Her attitude is great. Very personable, positive , and best of all very happy. You can tell she enjoys her job. This was the person we needed to see since, we were flying from Chicago, sitting at the airport and then cancelling our flight . We were very frustrated. Thank you Sierra for making it a positive trip. The drinks she recommended  was fantastic."}
{"text":"It's rare to have great service. We visited on 11.12.2016 and had Gloria. We loved her, she was very accommodating as we had two small children with us. And the food was great! Would eat there again."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hole in the wall place and its connected to The Best Western Hotel. I had the dippin chicken for lunch and it was three good size chicken fingers with waffle fries in a basket (forgot to take a picture). It was okay, but I've had better tasting chicken.  I think the majority of the food is way to overpriced. A sandwich is about $10 and burger is about $12-$15. They get you and are smart because this is literally the only restaurant and bar on 24th street within miles so you really dont have a choice if you are looking for a sit down, bar type place!"}
{"text":"One of the closer places to eat near PHX. Food was okay. Waitress could've cared less if I was there or not. Perhaps it'll get better towards evening. Inside decor has style. Lesson learned: don't trust the recommendation of a rental car porter."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning.  The service was great, fast and friendly.  I ordered coffee and water and they gave me a carafe of each to keep the beverages flowing.  This was great!  I had eggs, hash browns & biscuits and gravy.  The food was tasty and came out super fast.    I give this place four stars for the food, service and ample supply of coffee and water.  No waiting for the waitress to get refills - something every restaurant should do!  Linger if you like or catch a quick bite.  Nice start to my Monday morning!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place for lunch and happy hour with the coworkers. As of yet, I haven't had a bad experience here. So far the food is great, especially the Chicken Chilean. There are a few waitresses that could improve their customer service. But the service in the bar is great. Always smiling and ready to take care of you."}
{"text":"Ordered The Ortega Burger - Mild jalapeño peppers and jack cheese. Bacon added extra. Side of chips (soft and crispy potato wedges).  Though the Angry Orchard was a light overpriced, that burger was worth every penny. Service was great too. The ambiance is cool, left like O was eating in an elite gentlemen's club (not strip club)."}
{"text":"Great food, wine and service (thanks Axel) at better than great prices. Fun, cozy atmosphere, with lots of TVs and social seating arrangements. I was pleasantly surprised as a whole. I stayed at the Best Western for an early flight out of Phoenix. I had assumed the attached restaurant (even though indepently owned/operated) was going to over charge and under deliver. I was happy to be wrong. I would stay at the hotel again in large part of the Roadhouse. (Hotel was a great value and my expectations were exceeded there too)"}
{"text":"So I like to stay at this best western cause they have a bar and restaurant. Took someone's advice and ordered the Ruben. It was ridiculously disgusting haha. She was cool about it and took it off my bill after I told her it was ok and to leave it on the bill. They pour heavy drinks so that makes up for it. Ill totally stay here again but probably eat dinner somewhere else. Jenny is easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"great little hole in the wall to get away... Had the ham n swiss burger,, (swapping cheese allowed) and the chips were great,, and so were the sweet potato chips,,mmm delish,,   only down side was only 1 beer on tap... Bud Light.. Friends promote this place and havent had anything bad yet.."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat and the atmosphere was fun!  We had a large group that had just arrived from Illinois and they were happy to serve us even though it was getting late.  Food was really good but what made the place was Sierra, the bartender/waitstaff.  She was friendly, attentive and entertaining.  Family members had been there the night before as we were all flying in for a wedding in Sedona and she remembered their name and brought them up to us.  Just a really great experience after a long day traveling!  Would recommend highly!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cool and quiet, great for avoiding the typical lunch crowd. But you'll pay more for it. Everything was $11 or more, even the salads. The wait staff was sweet but seemed to rush us \"for paperwork purposes.\" I would recommend for a quiet place with good food. Not cheap though."}
{"text":"This was our first meal at a restaraunt post plane ride after living in Germany for almost six years. We were excited to get some American-style grub after such a long time. It's a nice cozy little place. We sat down and were served a big cold pitcher of Coke (with ice!). I thought I was going to drown I drank so much. I ordered the chicken quesadillas, my wife and daughter ordered the chicken with chips, and my son got the \"Rodehouse\" burger with Tavern chips. My quesadillas were average(could have done with a little more cheese), but they blew away every \"Mexican\" dish we ever ordered in Germany. The wife and kids seemed to enjoy thier meals and the price was about average. I honestly enjoyed my Coke more than anything else, which must be weird for anyone to hear. If you could give 3 and half stars, I would, because I thought the service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I won't give it more than 3 stars because the dining area was not well lit. Also, the short 3 steps onto the dining area do not have any signs that give you an inclination to watch your step. My elderly father almost fell face first.  Food was ok not fantastic but the waitresses were nice. Its a starving stop."}
