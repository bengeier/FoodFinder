{"text":"We ordered take out for 4 people. My burger had a long black hair between the burger and bun ugh! I emailed them with details of what happened...never received a reply. It was the first and last time I will order from this restaurant. Mostly because I received no reply...showed me they do not care much about their customers."}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch today. It was very slow when we arrived,  with just a few loners sitting at the bar. Our waitress was nice, and the service was quick. Those two things are the only upsides of my experience. The place is dark, dingy, and dirty. The women's bathrooms were so dirty, I almost decided to pee my pants to save myself from the herpes that surely coated every surface. I may need to get tested. I should have left right then but I was hungry.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger without lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo. It arrived at the table with no bacon. Bacon is the first word of the name of the menu item. BACON cheeseburger..come on people. We politely told the waitress, and she returned with a plate of soggy, greasy bacon, and a joke about how stupid the kitchen staff was. So I actually have what I ordered, and I take a few bites. It tastes kinda weird, and I realize it tastes like fake butter, onions, and peppers. I hate onions and peppers. HATE, hate, hate them. They obviously don't maintain their flat grill,  and cross contaminate food. I'm weird, and then all I could think about was how there's a really good chance my food was cross contaminated with a number of other horrible things too. I won't be going back. Retro Dog is right across the street, delicious,  and clean. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Horrible.Horrible.Horrible. Sat for 30 minutes before drink order was taken. After ordering drinks, they took about 15 minutes to get to the table. Food order was not taken until about 65 minutes after we originally sat down. Food took so long to come out I lost track of time. Sad to have to give such a low rating to a place that seems to have so much potential."}
{"text":"Horrible service- everything takes forever....refills, extra sauces... Everything!  and a there's flys flying around. Some wings are covered in sauce- some barely have any... Don't waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"Wings are good, large size, and lots of sauces to choose from. Service was not so good. When asked for beers on draft we were told \"a lot\" and handed a hand written list I could barely read. Server didn't offer any info about beers when asked. And she got sizes wrong on the beers. She also got the wing sauces wrong too. Next time I'll sit at the bar and hope for better"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just ate here before a concert and had the worst experience. They were out of what we ordered, the service was slow and our waiter did not fulfill his job of refilling drinks and checking on us to make sure we didn't need anything else, and they tried to charge us for what we didn't get. Overall I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Wings are great as long as you get the right flavor. Service was a little slow but super nice and welcoming! It can get pretty loud when it's really busy, and kids are running around sometimes. But overall a pretty good experience :)"}
{"text":"Let me first say that when prepared well their wings are great. I will follow that up by saying it is a gamble whether or not they will be prepared well. Most recently my wings came out with very little sauce on them. I requested more sauce and was billed a dollar for a small cup. This is par for the course at Wing Warehouse. The service here is consistently the worst I've ever experienced. Waitresses are few and far between and only come out to sell you more alcohol. So if you don't drink get ready for a lonely and thirsty meal. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Sad to see the negative reviews as I have only had good experiences here.  The wings are always good with an excellent variety of sauces.  Probably my favorite wing spot in Akron.  Other things on the menu have always been on point and service has always been good, if at times a bit slow due to volume of people in the place.  The new outdoor patio is also a nice touch."}
{"text":"You'd think a place that is called \"Wing Warehouse\" and a chicken as a logo, would have delicious chicken....Well thats not the case here. I ordered a fried buffalo chicken sandwich and it tasted like a dry frozen chicken filet that was dipped in watered down flavorless sauce. The fries that accompanied my sandwich were undercooked and floppy. I gave this place a second try after a bad first experience, Not coming back."}
{"text":"We ordered the onion rings, mushrooms and fried pickles.  Very good!  The batter is tasty and fried just right.  30 beers on tap is pretty impressive too.  The wings were excellent.  Service was very good, as well.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Driving down the street this place doesn't look like much but that's when I realized...it's the side of the building.  It's much more appealing from the front so give it a chance and go in!  I had a ridiculously cheap and tasty long island iced tea.  We started with the gouda mac & cheese bites...SO DELICIOUS!  My husband tried a burger and I had a quesadilla.  Service was okay and our food took quite a while but we'll certainly return.  Good prices, tasty food!"}
{"text":"Only went here once to place a carry out order. Food was ok. Nothing to brag about. Service was horrible! Took at least 30 to 45 min to get my order and that was after I finally got the attention of the bartender. There were only about 15 to 20 people in the whole restaurant at the time. She was not very attentive or friendly. I won't go back. Ill go to the stow wing warehouse where the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Wings are a guilty pleasure for me.  I could eat them every day but hold back for fear of 'letting myself go'.  Bone-in, boneless, extra crispy, good sauce - you've got heaven on your plate.  From the looks of things, this place has everything going for it - a great location in an otherwise barren stretch of Steels Corners, an extensive food menu, so many wing flavors it's almost overwhelming to pick just one, two, or three, and great daily and lunch and drink specials.  Their beer special on Friday actually made a tall Yuengling less expensive than a short draft, and with 40-cent boneless wings, it was a total score!  12 boneless wings with a tall Yuengling ran me roughly $8+tax/tip.  Overall, I thought the wings were pretty good, but nothing to write home about.  I will say that the garlic hot parmesan sauce is amazing and I felt a couple sweat beads while I was eating.  Mojave ranch and chipotle barbecue are next up!  The problem here is the slow service.  It took more than a few minutes to be seated at a restaurant that was maybe 20% full.  Drinks and water came out at a moderate pace, but the food took forever.  Maybe they have intricate processes in creating their sandwiches and coating their wings with sauce, but I doubt it, and was confused as to how throwing things in a deep fryer could take any more than 10 minutes.  The waitresses were super friendly, but I was surprised how often they were out of sight considering the amount of people not in the restaurant.  I didn't mind waiting because I was catching up with friends, but I would be concerned about the timing if I only had an hour for lunch.    I still prefer BW3's or The Winking Lizard when I am at home, but this is a solid food spot in the Falls.  I just hope they can work out their service issues."}
{"text":"More of a bar than a restaurant. Wings were passable. Our waiter was super friendly. Not sure if they have a DJ every night, but it was super loud in the place.  Menu is typical bar food, and the prices were high for the type and quality of the food. At least for the wings we ordered."}
{"text":"Been here twice and service is horrible. My fries were cold. The place is freezing inside wish I'd of had gloves with me.  Bathroom Was disgusting and must only be cleaned once a day.  The bartender left early so drinks were meh or twenty minutes later !  Boo!  Won't go back"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner last week and I HAD to update my review!!  I ordered the Cajun dry rub wings and they were AMAZING!!!  I mean I am STILL craving them!  Our wings were fresh, hot, crispy and SPICY and unbelievable!!    We topped it all off with Amber Bock, South Western Spud Bites, Hot Wings, Teriyaki Wings and a feeble glass of Merlot (I must be getting old).    The downside was an obnoxious female Dallas Cowboys fan whose \"potty mouth\" cleared the room (literally).  We felt bad for the families with kids who came to eat at 6:30 on a Sunday evening and were treated to a barrage of F-Bombs... it even made me wince.  The bad language is not the norm here though.  We will be back (and soon!)"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time recently since I live close by but I almost never eat at any restaurants in stow because they are so compared to neighbor cities like Hudson, falls, Akron and drive little further to fairlawn. So I tried it out: the chipotle BBQ wings actually tasted ok not great but ok. Next we had buffalo bonesless wings. Not great flavor it basically tasted the same if I would have microwaved them. Lastly we had garlic fries; not good. They were soggy, drenched in garlic so overall was disappointed and will not be back. I would rather driver extra distance to BW3, Quaker steak, or even wing warehouse. You clearly can't trust this local chain compared to bigger chain wing options. Not to mention their prices here are not any cheaper either so there is literally not one thing better at this place compared to any other wing restaurant around"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere.  New location - very clean inside.  Beer is cold and the wings are pretty good.  I like the \"garage\"-feel to it with the NASCAR cars on the perimeter."}
{"text":"We went on Draft Day so it was super busy. The crowd wasn't our typical crowd and it was super loud, but that's just the environment I guess. The food is great and our waitress McKenzie H was phenomenal. She was super attentive and understanding as the couple we were meeting was an hour late, but her kindness and attentiveness never changed."}
{"text":"Wings are the greatest around...especially on wing night! Service is a little less than adequate and many waitresses seem annoyed when you ask for something..."}
{"text":"Throughly enjoyed my first visit here today!   Hugeeee pub that is seat yourself. I was promptly given a menu by a very nice waiter. Ordered a fat draft and some of their \"famous\" garlic fries to start. Garlic fries were bomb and had huge chunks of garlic and a lot of Parmesan cheese!   I was pretty ravenous so I ordered a dozen of the spicy garlic parm. You can really tell a restaurants wings are going to be good based on the size. These bad boys were huge, juicy, and didn't get soggy! Some of the best wings I've had around Cuyahoga Falls!   Can't wait to go back and try the other wing flavors~"}
{"text":"Lousy service.  Took 45 min for wings, and they were cold.  Had to get up and ask for napkins.  The cold wings would never have even come out, if I hadn't walked to the bar and asked about them.  The wings are mediocre....not worth it.  The atmosphere is like a crappy college bar.    I watched a waiter spill a full glass of water on the floor, and on some patrons, and just let people stand in and walk through the puddle.  No one even cleaned it up.  Do yourself a favor.  Go to Winking Lizard or Quaker Steak and Lube."}
{"text":"I came here expecting the same amazing wings and great service I got at the Wing Warehouse branch in Canal Park.  I was terribly wrong.  The wings tasted fake.  There wasn't much meat, even in the boneless wings.  It just tasted like bone marrow and processed meat.  They were not even worth the 40 cents I paid for each wing.  However, the sauces I ordered sufficed.  If you're wanting a spicy wing that has some \"kick\" with it, I'd recommend the Ouch! flavor with your wings.  Those were hot enough for me, yet they weren't even the hottest flavor available.  The service here was mediocre at best.  I understand that the restaurant was packed, but the waitress could have at least acknowledged me while I was waiting for her to cash me out or take my order for some more wings.  She also botched up my order a few times.  I'd like to think that not all servers are that awful at their jobs here, but this was inexcusable.  The layout seemed more warehouse-y than at Canal Park, which isn't bad.  My only complaint was that it is more difficult to hear when you eat here because of how the noise bounces off of everything.  Drink prices seemed reasonable, although I stuck with the water.  If you can find someplace else to eat, that would probably be better than what I experienced here."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about my wings. I HATE dry wings. To me, chicken wings are just a good excuse to eat some SAUCE! Consequently, I always order extra sauce, and I always say WET because I want them to put the sauce all over the wings. Don't give me a SIDE of sauce in that tiny cup! Last night, I ordered like this at Wing Warehouse, and they came out PERFECTLY. MOJAVE RANCH! Awesome. Wings were large. NOT over-fried and hard as a rock, break your teeth CRUNCHY like most wing places. The waitress actually took my order correctly, and the cook actually followed it! Juicy chicken meat with LOTS of sauce. Perfect! Wing places almost always screw this up, and it always baffles me because IT'S NOT ROCKET SURGERY. Thank you, Wing Warehouse, for getting it RIGHT!!!"}
{"text":"I would rank 0 stars, but it won't allow me.  Service was good.  The food was the issue.  No surprise on the bar atmosphere, but I have never had chicken wings that were that bad.  Little to no taste and in a pool of oil in the bottom of the basket.  I would bypass this place if you are looking for wings or anything to eat."}
{"text":"Tried this place again. Almost.  Wanted to see the Cavaliers PLAYOFF game but most of the TV's were showing other events - from baseball to women's golf.  Couldn't get a good view of the PLAYOFF game.  So we left.  I would give five stars for variety of sports on their TV's but really, this is the most tone deaf \"sports\" bar I've ever been in."}
{"text":"This place is okay. You'll have to drive a bit north or west to get better wings at Winking Lizard but this place is sufficient.  They might still do a dollar domestics night. That was totally worth it.  Biggest recommendation for the manager, though -- turn down the loud a little. Especially if there is a band, it is IMPOSSIBLE to carry on a conversation. No one can yell loud enough to understand anything. My friend had to text me and I was two feet from him :)."}
{"text":"I don't know what the other yelpers are talking about; this place is amazing. Wings are amazing. They are big and the sauces are amazing. Barbecue hot is my favorite. Their ranch is amazing. The prices are reasonable. Yes I like to use the word 'amazing' to describe this place.   On Thursdays it is dollar domestic bottles. How can you go wrong?  I have never had a problem with service besides when they have been packed on Thursday night for dollar domestics. Other than that night no issues.   Great place to hang out with friends and have a great meal and a great beer.   Wing night is basically Monday through Wednesday. 40 cent boneless 50 cent regular."}
{"text":"seriously do not go here! walked in no one was there to great us so we asked someone if we just sit anywhere and they said yea. After we sat down my fiancé had to go find us a high chair, after 10 minutes and no one coming over to our table we just got up and left! as we were leaving we noticed all the employees were just standing up at the bar talking. the building wasn't packed at all maybe 5 tables in the whole place and bar was full. beyond annoyed when we left and will never be returning to any wing warehouse location and will be telling everyone we know never to go here!!"}
{"text":"I have always had a pleasant experience when dining here.  We normally go on a Mon., Tues, or Wed. because those are wing special nights.  The service is always outstanding.  Some nights the food is slow to come out, but that is not the waitress's fault.  The wet ranch are our favorites.  The King James is tasty as well. Some wing baskets do not have as much sauce on them as well."}
{"text":"Sports bar atmosphere with the world's most uncomfortable straight-backed wooden booths. Try to get a hightop table, some have chairs with backs. Many tvs tuned into many games.  Wings (why else would anyone come here) are a decent size, tasty, and swimming in sauce."}
{"text":"Great food. Friday nights are karaoke nights usually. I highly recommend their appetizers. One of my favorite places if I just want a beer and some wings or fried snacks."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible!  I had an hour and 15 minutes for lunch and went in with 6 buddies.  Six customers in entire place, we got our drinks and placed an order.   Never got a refill and had to get the lunch to go because it kept being \"just a few more minutes\".  Boss throws us a bone and gives us extended lunch and had to get it to go?  Seriously?  I gave it a 1 because food taste decent"}
{"text":"I've had better wings, but they're decent, and on the wing nights they are cheap.  Service has always been great.  The bartender is generous with portions."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. It is a stones throw from my house so I thought I'd give them at least 3 chances. Last night was my 3rd and final time buying anything from the Wing Warehouse. I ordered between 40-50 bucks worth of takeout and probably got about 20 dollars worth. I started with the wing party platter. It is supposed to come with 24 wings, 3 sauces, poppers, fries and cheese sticks. Well we got 24 wings, but only 2 of the sauces were correct and no cheese sticks, fries, or poppers. Ordered an additional dozen which were good. Wanted celery/carrots, blue cheese and ranch. None of that was in our bag but my receipt sure said I paid for it. With Panini's being right down the street, I'll start getting my takeout from there.   Summary: ordered party platter. Only got the wings. Paid for everything."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. They were hosting a special event for the concert at blossom this weekend. You would think they would be prepared for it. We waited two hours and never got our food. We got only two drinks in those two hours and watched 3 tables, who arrived after us, get their food.  We never got an apology for it and had to argue with them to get the food taken off our bill. I will never go there before a concert again or recommend it. Can't really rate on the food because we never got it."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for wings and beer after work.   The boneless wings are a great deal on Mondays and the apps are half priced for cavs games.   The wings are absolutely delicious with a variety of unique sauce flavors to choose from.   The only complaint is a lot of their app portions are small. Their mac and cheese bites are delicious but you only get a few of them.   The pretzel bites are stuffed with cheese and you get a decent amount of those.   The waiters are always friendly and honest about portion size and will point you in the direction of the best bang for your buck!   I prefer wing warehouse to Bdubs or any other major chain sports bar because you are not right on top of the person next to you, there is more of a variety of food and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"I am not even slighly dramatizing this review. Walk in and your blasted by extremely noisy football games.  Im all about the foorball but good lord. We seat ourselves at the first available table that was can watch the game thats screaming  at us. Table is wobbly and sticky but i can get server to fix that.  :::::::::::::::::::tic toc::::::::::::::::::::tic toc::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 17 minutes exactly go by. No one has even looked our way. I decide to be proactive .As i approach the bar, i notice yet again its not even slighlty full. Maybe 6 people at best. Bartender is at the other end of the bar talking to a server that could have been helping us. Conversation was about some customer from night before last i gather as other patrons join in. Probably would have been a good story if i had a drink and full belly. Finally someone down yonder on my right yells \" Tracy are you working or holding that wall up\" she shoots him a dirty look holding up a finger gesturing she will be there in a minute. Finally she walks by me to help the guy who already yelled at her and asked what\"in the hell\" he wanted. He simply explained i had been standing there since last tuesday which was comical. After glaring at him, she walked up and asked what i need. Not even slighly pleasant or an ounce of enthusiasm.  I explain ive been waiting and point to table and she promised someome will be right over. Right over meant waiting another 4 minutes. Our server comes over reaking of cigarettes and huffing like she just stepped off the track running a 5k. She barely remembers the beers on tap but we got through that and put in a wing order. Food was good but had 2 napkins between the two of us. And our drinks came after our food only because we had to ask....twice!  The bill was basically thrown at us i mean gosh we were interrupting her social time. Her tip was 10% and that was hard to swallow. Never again."}
{"text":"they have finally hired a competent waitress! i am delighted!  her name is Rachel M, and she couldn't have been better! she was friendly, she made sure our drinks were full and that we had everything we needed. also, on this visit, our boneless wings tasted perfect! just enough sauce, and cooked exactly right.  the worst waitress in town (her name is Julie) still works there, but at least now we have an option if Rachel is there! Rachel, you rule--we are your biggest fans! And Julie--BOO to you. If you hate being nice to people, why are you in the service industry?"}
