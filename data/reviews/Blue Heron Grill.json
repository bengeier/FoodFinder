{"text":"Quality restaurant hidden here in Fort Mill / Indian Land.  I enjoyed a fresh local seafood entree with seasonal vegetables.  Very affordable with great service and local atmosphere.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is now called Tavern on the Lake and is under new management and new kitchen crew.  Should I generate a new business?

I will do that and write the review.

{"text":"Food bland and tasteless. fish was drowning in oil. the food is not even up to pub standard.  Carpet old and the whole restaurant Needs an updating,"}
{"text":"This restaurant, now called Tavern on the Lakes, is largely unknown outside of Sun City and the local golfing community. The food and service is excellent. 

The restaurant hired a new chef around July 4, 2016, so the older reviews are obsolete."}
