{"text":"This restaurant has been recommended by a couple Korean friends of mine.  I tried it about 5 years ago, then again today.  This is a steady as she goes kind of place, so the lapsed time between visits is immaterial as I'm sure it was exactly the same at the turn of the millenium.  This restaurant serves all of the Korean classics, from Kalbi to Bibimbap to self-serve table-top BBQ.  The dishes are on the pricey side, with few coming in under $15, but are always accompanied by a variety of complimentary condiments (see photo) to keep things interesting.  Even just getting the $11 soft tofu and seafood soup is very satisfying for lunch, with the accompanying condiments and compulsory rice.  I don't think the dishes here will knock your culinary socks off, but are well prepared and very enjoyable to those who like at least moderate spice and finely balanced textures/tastes.  This restaurant might get 4 stars, except for the spotty service, and dour pre-millennial decor."}
{"text":"I had never heard of the Club House until my friend suggested we go there last night. I've had lots of asian cuisine but never Korean food so I was excited to see what it was like.  We were both pretty hungry so we ended up getting #11, which is basically a meal for 2. It comes with a lot of small dishes - fish, rice, tofu, eff, a few different types of veggies, soup and some sprouts. We also had rice tea (which as my friend described, tastes like dishwasher soapy water haha). It wasn't that bad but was definitely a different taste. I like how sushi you have green tea, vietnamese you have jasmine and korean you have rice tea.  I really liked the varied flavours and that I felt somewhat clean after eating it since it was all steamed and was pretty light on the stomach. Their chopsticks were sweet since they were metal and not the crappy wood ones you have to break apart wishbone style and worry about splinters.  If you're looking to try a new place around the NW/Bowness, I'd highly recommend trying the Club House!"}
