{"text":"I love love love this place. Missy the owner is amazing. I love how she helps the community and the cats and kittens who are in need. I have never been to a more peaceful loving kitty environment. If your looking for a peaceful break this is your spot. If your looking for a fur kid to adopt and want to make sure you mesh this is your spot. I can't say enough about this place. Good job Missy."}
{"text":"I have been to numerous painting classes at la gattara and have loved each and every one, except the princess Leia class. Unfortunately  this class was not enjoyable. I went to the class expecting Artsyarti as the teacher, as that is what was advertised, but it was 2 new teachers. Artsyarti has taught me in previous classes how to make works of art that I was very proud of and ended up creating a \"cat wall\" at my house with the paintings. Artsyarti walked us through every step and walked around assisting in each class (which was incredibly helpful). I am disappointed to report that this class did not go that way. We were barely given direction on how to draw princess Leia and when it came to painting everybody was on their own. I really debated posting about this but I saw that the next class will not be with Artsyarti and because of that I will not be attending again. Artsyarti is an amazing teacher and an amazing artist! The description of these classes say you will be walked through each step and that is what I looked forward to as I do not know how to paint."}
{"text":"Seriously such an adorable place! So glad I found it. All my sister wanted for her birthday was to go to a cat cafe and this place did not disappoint. Although it's not technical a \"cafe\" yet (waiting on licenses) don't let that deter you. If you just want to play with some cats or looking to adopt it's a perfect place. Almost all the cats were very friendly and quite playful. It was a happy atmosphere and considering the amount of cats, very clean. Couldn't be happier with our visit today."}
{"text":"I was really excited one of these opened up in Tempe!  Not a bad price for an hour, but I wish there had been more cats and kittens.  Most of them were sleeping.  Super easy to reserve a spot online.   You can also see online how many available spots there are (go when there are the most available so that you have the most access to all the cats).  But most of all I love and support their mission!!"}
{"text":"This looks like a really fun place but they need to update their hours on their website. My daughter has been talking about coming here for two weeks and we finally made it only to find out that they open at noon and not the 10 o'clock they have posted on their website.

Sorry for the smudged face prints on your windows...."}
{"text":"Great place to just come and relax. The employee informed me they're still getting started so there will be many changes to come. I loved how both employees seemed genuinely passionate about cats and their welfare. They even showed me a few in the back room who just arrived and are still adjusting. I love all the color, the mellow music, and the options to sit on pillows and fluffy rugs with the cats. Ample toys to play. The only thing I didn't like was that at one point it got a little busy and was hard to play during our hour. I'd recommend calling ahead to find out open spaces when there aren't a lot of people. All cats are available to adopt. I would come again."}
{"text":"Such a great idea for the cat lovers of Phoenix! This adorable place is a mellow, cheerful place to hang out and get your fill of cats. The cats roam freely and get along wonderfully. They have cubbyholes, perches, sunny windows, and cat TV! Most are up for adoption and the adoption rate here is high! Many special events are held at night and weekends like yoga and painting. Cats participate too! A cute boutique is in the back with great merchandise for any cat lover. Fantastic place, check it out!"}
{"text":"There are still some things that haven't been implemented yet, but this place looks impressive already. I mean, I came to see cats and I was definitely not disappointed. I feel like the environment would be therapeutic for people with anxiety, depression, autism, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Of course, even if you don't have those things, it's still a very enjoyable and stress-relieving experience. The cats are adorable and it's very fun to play with them or watch them play with each other. I went here with a few friends to celebrate my birthday and it was easily the best birthday I've had in a while. I feel like I could never get tired of coming here and will certainly be back again and again."}
{"text":"Went to cat yoga this morning. So much fun and so relaxing. The cats really enjoyed being part of the class. What a great idea!  The owner is super nice and clearly has a passion to care for cats"}
{"text":"This is the best place to visit in Mesa!  I stopped in on my business trip to get a few snuggles and purrs and wasn't disappointed.  I can't wait for a return trip."}
{"text":"10 stars!! My favorite place to unwind!! First of all, $10 for an hour with 15-18 cats to play with/snuggle/give treats is a bargain!!! All of the cats are adoptable which is awesome, and they rotate them out so that all the cats in the shelter have a chance to be socialized and/or adopted-even more awesome. I haven't had a chance to do the yoga or paint nights, but am hoping to soon! The owner is a real sweetheart, so kind and welcoming any time I've been in! Whether it's a cute date spot, family outing, or just somewhere to unwind and destress this place is it! Thanks for always a great experience!!"}
{"text":"What a great little cafe and wine bar shop with the sweetest, adoptable cats and kittens! They are currently in the process of getting permits so the café is coming together nicely. The café is decorated in white furniture and lots of soft pillows and blankets in pink and teal colors. The walls are being filled with cat paintings and there are fun furniture pieces. They even have a few wine \"cat\" boxes that cats sleep in. I need to get one for my babies. 

The best part of this place are the rescue cats and kittens that are social, playful, affectionate and all available for adoption! Today was my first visit and I attended a cat yoga class. The instructor (she's a sub, what was her name?) was fantastic and led a great stretching class that I really needed and hoped for. The cats and kittens would walk around and lay on our mats while we worked out. Some let you hold them and would fall asleep on people. After the class many of us stayed and played with the sweet felines. I believe the cats and kittens are either locally found or from Lost Our Home (a great cat and dog rescue in Tempe!). Definitely looking forward to a paint night there soon with a new friend I met in class today. The photos I'm posting are all from today. 

Thanks for opening this wonderful place to help save cats!"}
{"text":"Cool place, cool cats!! They do a lot of good too, adopted out lots of cats needing homes."}
{"text":"They are still working to get the actual \"cafe\" part up - but the atmosphere is delightful. I mean it's all about CATS! You certainly can't go wrong with that. Great cause and certainly a lovely experience. If you love cats... this is basically what heaven is like.

I participated in the Kickstarter for this business a while back, so I am thrilled to see it materialize. Though, I typically stick to the Central Phoenix area, I will absolutely be making special trips out to Tempe to hang out with the wonderful kitties (and people too)!"}
{"text":"There was no cafe. No coffee no food. Just cats which is great but I was expecting a cafe since that is in the name."}
{"text":"If you would have asked me three weeks ago, I would have given at least four starts, but not after the princess Leia cat paint night.  My friend and I expected Artsyarti, the regular artist and the artist advertised to host the class, but that did not happen.  The class was hosted by two very sweet young girls, but gave no direction.  I do not blame these girls, I am sure they did what they were told, but everyone had a painting that looked completely different from the others.  Artsyarti was very helpful and shared many of her painting techniques.  By the end of her  class, everyone had a painting that looked very similar to the advertised painting, but not at all with the new girls.    I had planned on going to every paint class offered.  I have three paintings I am very proud of thanks to Artsyarti and one that I can't bare to look at.  I am not an artist, so when Artsyarti was able to show me how to paint and walk me through the process I came out feeling proud of my work.  I am so disappointed, I really wanted to continue going to events at the cafe, but I am not going to.  It has left a very bad impression.  I will miss the cats very much, but I can't bare another class like the Princess Leia class."}
{"text":"As of this review the Cafe is not fully operational.  They are doing special events at this time, so please checkout their website, Facebook, and Instagram.  

I went for Yoga and Cats.  The instructor was clawsome!  Good workout with lots of cat puns.  The cats stole the show though!  I would definitely do it again. 

I'm looking forward to when they are fully operational.  Until then, I will just have to sign up for some more special events."}
{"text":"I love LaGattara Cat Lounge!  It was such a great experience to learn about this place after my first yoga with cats class!  My son Orion had his first experience meeting a kitten here and we got to meet up with friends and bond and play with kitties!    They are memories that he will always have and the owner and her staff are so welcoming and it gives me hope to know such a place exists.  
We love coming here and I love how clean it is and how there are sooo many great activities that we can all participate in whether it's painting or yoga or bingo!  
Anyone that finds this place will find themselves wanting to come back again!  I had a hard time getting up last time because a sweet kitty was sleeping on my lap.  Just absolute bliss!  
Thank you for all you do La Gattara and for providing such a zen place for the kittens and cats and for us hoomans (yes I spelled it that way on purpose ) 
Peace Love and Meow"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness....kitties everywhere!!!!!!! Kittens, older cats...and the best part is they are all available for adoption.

What a great way to spend and hour or two relaxing and just playing with cats. They have all sorts of toys you can play with and lots of comfy seating, including some beanbags if you want to curl up and snuggle with a sleepy kitty. They also have some games and books if you want to sit at a table to play.

There is a little area with cat related items for sale sauce as cups, blankets, art work and you can buy a soda or tea. The whole place is bright and colorful and does NOT smell like a giant litter box.

They also do events like yoga, drag queen bingo and painting nights if you are looking for a fun and different night out or some exercise."}
{"text":"The owner was very friendly and informative. Surpassingly, it was very clean and didn't smell like litter box. The cats were very relaxed, not timid at all. Their obvious comfort contributes to the cats being adopted. The owner shares stories of cars that arrived timid and terrified from a shelter, that are now purring while they're pet by guests. There has been 76 adopted, 1 that's been \"chosen\" but is awaiting being taken home and another 1-2 were adopted while we were here. Awesome!! 

Be patient, it's a one woman shop on limited funds so there's still work to be done and minimal drinks available.  She's getting everything done as quickly as possible and doing a good deed, for cats and humans alike, in the midst of it."}
{"text":"This place is great!
There are so many aspects to this review so I'll take them one by one.
First- the cats! They've adopted out SO MANY cats! The environment is perfect  if you want a cat who is well socialized (which I need since there are always so many people in and out of my house!) They're clean, well cared for, and oh so lovable!
Secondly- the space itself is just awesome. It's cute, relaxing, clean. It doesn't smell like cats at all, you'd never know there were cats in the space, let alone how many there actually are!
Next- the boutique. SO MUCH CUTE STUFF! They have a good drink selection most days of both popular drinks in their cooler, as well as locally produced teas which are phenomenal. The days they have a slimmer selection is always due to high traffic of people throughout the day.
The management is always super helpful, kind, and on top of things. Her hair even matches the decor! She knows each cat by name, and regularly gets updates on the cats she's helped adopt out from La Gattara. I love going in and hearing stories about how some of my favorites have been doing in their new furever homes!
Definitely a great place, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My favorite place to relax! There are always a ton of kitties (and sometimes baby kittens!) to play with and the owner Melissa is incredibly sweet and friendly. They offer yoga classes, paint night and drag queen bingo in addition to regular lounge hours, so there's something for everyone! I have been to cat cafes in other states and this is the best. There's not a set time limit to your visit, and it's only $10! The cats are available for adoption, so if you're looking to adopt you can get to know the different kitties and see which one is the best fit for you! I feel so lucky to have a place like this in my city! Definitely worth checking out if you're in from out of town or if you just want a relaxing way to spend an hour (or more!)."}
{"text":"I mean, it's very much what you see is what you get, and what you get is a large room with a variety of cats. It does smell a little bit like cat but like, what do you want, it's a cat lounge. It could smell a whole hell of a lot more like cats. 

I can imagine people might go and be disappointed, b/c cats very famously cannot be coerced into affection, and it would be possible to go in and get at best a cool reaction from its denizens. But, you know, they're cats. And if you're polite, you can probably get at least one sleepy cat to let you scratch their chin.

I think probably the key to the experience is to just know cats and adjust your expectations. Plus, the proprietor is very friendly and ostensibly you're paying an entrance fee for an hour, but I stayed way past that without issue. Great experience, and also fairly close to a light rail station."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I just had to drive all the way out to Tempe to check it out because the concept really piqued my interest. We paid a $10 cover to lounge with about 25-30 cats/kittens. It's hard not to fall in love with them. La Gatarra seems to be doing very well with adoptions.. I was the 14th adoption and they were still in their first month of being open! I know they are well over 14 now.. last I checked they were around 50!
I adopted Walter and now he's the light of my life!!"}
{"text":"Supper cool place to hang out and get the cat love in. Plenty of toys and cat related games. Some cats don't  get along together. All the cats seem heathy and happy but a few seemed sickly and wounded not sure how to feel about that. But over all is a fun place and I will go again"}
{"text":"I came to LaGattara for a paint night - it was amazing! All of the supplies were set up when I arrived, and we had a great instructor who did a really good job at not only teaching the painting, but checking in with everyone along the way to answer questions and provide help. 

Now...about the cats. How could anyone not love a place with a dozen sweet kitties roaming around?! All of the cats were well-socialized, and super friendly. It's clear that they are well loved, and I loved the \"Who's who\" bulletin board that shared information about the feline residents and who had been adopted so far. I'll be back again when I need to let off some steam!"}
{"text":"Great place for cat lovers! You can hang out with cats pet them play with them even take one home. I brought my granddaughter here a smile on her face the whole time playing with kitties and petting them."}
{"text":"This is a really sweet, relaxing place! It's so casual, just go in, sit on the floor and play with the kitties! It doesn't get any better than this! The kitties are so playful. They play and purr and sit on your lap. It's so relaxing. A cute little orange kitty crawled up in my lap and fell asleep. I had a hard time staying awake!!! I took my granddaughter and she was in heaven! We'll be back"}
{"text":"This place is super cute! And what the owner is doing here is awesome. Tons of little rescue kittens ready to be adopted. I went here for a yoga session with instructor Lauren and it was so much fun. Though the kittens are a little distracting, that was basically the point. To do some yoga with loving little kittens running all around you. It is a very fun experience and if you love kittens, I highly recommend just spending a few hours here. You'll fall in love. They also have other events like paint night and wine night I think. I will have to try that. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Awesome place !!! They have many different types of events! They have Yoga with Cats, paint with cats and movies with cats . There are so many adorable kittens running around and adult cats whom are ready to be adopted."}
{"text":"This is the best $10 I've ever spent in Tempe. The cats are adorable, and the boutique offers fantastic items for both cats and cat lovers. My cats went nuts over the long catnip kick toy I bought for them. It's a great place to go if you want to just chill and kiss kitties. If I worked nearby, I would spend my lunch breaks here! I made it out of the place without taking one home with me, but it was tough!"}
{"text":"After a long day at work, hanging out with some felines sounded like a great way to unwind. I saw on their FB page that they were open until 9pm and finally stopped in to this cafe.

I got really excited when I found the place in the shopping center because I could just see a bunch of kittens and cats roaming around through the windows. I received a warm welcome from the cafe crew when I walked in as they let me walk in past the fence to play with the kitties. Of course, they were more into sleeping and playing with each other than me but I didn't expect more from cats. Plus, they're in the process of being socialized by humans so it takes time.

I was able to roam around and hang out in their space. They had furniture and beds for the cats and toys for them to play with. They were decorating their adoption wall with some lettering when I was there and it looked cool. It's wonderful that all of the cats are available to adopt and that the staff knows them so well. They were excited to see Bear responding to my play with the feathered wand. One kitten just stole my heart with being uber cute and cuddly. I could've just taken him(?) home in my pocket! The best feeling is coming home later and being with my own cat, which is why adopting cats is so great and everyone should do it. 

They are still updating and doing renovations and hosting special events to raise money to complete their cafe. I'm excited to see what it will turn into and hope it will continue to receive LOTS of support from the community, which it seems like it does already."}
{"text":"Okay, first of all the fact that this place exists is cool and their mission is INCREDIBLE! Aside from the awesomeness of LaGattara Cat Cafe as a place for kitties to roam free and feel love before being adopted by kind-hearted people.....I am here to talk about the CAT YOGA CLASS. Did you hear me?!?! CAT. YOGA. PEOPLE. Lauren is THE BEST yoga teacher I have EVER had the pleasure of studying with. I go week after week to every class and I'm not sure what's better, Lauren's PAWsitive attitude and cat puns, or the cuteness of the kitties romping all over and coming to chill with us in the class. It's SUCH a feel good experience. GO HERE NOW. Unless you are allergic to cats. In which case, I feel bad that you will not get to experience this rad class in this lovely cat-lovers sanctuary."}
{"text":"From the start this passion project has been nothing but awesome. Melissa is so awesome and engaging with everyone that comes through the door. It's still getting off the ground but it was so fun to see all the cat stuff you can buy or if you're just having a bad day and need some cheering up, this place will do it. I hope everyone checks it out and truly helps this place grow."}
{"text":"oh my goodness what a wonderful concept . Beautiful cats and time well spent . Melissa is s very kind hearted person and fun to talk to."}
{"text":"This was so much fun. I went there for a Paint with Cats night with 3 of my friends. The entire group was 20 of so people all painting and mingling with cats and kittens. We all painted a portrait of a cat with pearls and a tiara with an instructor. They supply the canvas and all the art supplies. It's on University, easy to get to with plenty of parking. 
All the cats and kittens are adoptable and very sweet and all the staff members are welcoming.  At the end of the night we took a group photo with our creations. It was a pleasant evening of art, friends and cats."}
{"text":"LaGattara is such an inclusive, light hearted, and inviting place to come and hang out. The owner is incredibly sweet and passionate about her work, which makes it hard not to enjoy your time. 
The boutique is a paradise for a connoisseur of cat based wears, including mugs, wine glasses, and much more! While they don't provide fresh coffee, they certainly have a Keurig and several selections of cold refreshments you can treat yourself to while enjoying your stay! They have plans for even more selections, including pre packaged foods and cupcakes in the future! 
She charges a flat $10 for an hour of unlimited kitty cuddles during lounge hours, but let's you stay as long as you want, unless it gets too crowded in the lounge. It's a very affordable and fun way to spend time with the family and friends alike! If you're interested in a fun place with a relaxing, upbeat ambience, look no further! LaGattara is the place for you. And since it's currently the only cat café and lounge in Arizona, it can't be missed!!"}
{"text":"I came across this place on accident. We were next door buying fish. When we walked out I saw their sign and had to check it out. I was immediately greeted by Melissa's beautiful face. She told us all about her place and how it was started. She is very passionate about what she does. What an amazing concept. You walk in and hang out with beautiful cats of all ages. All but one of them are adoptable. This is such a blessing for the community. These cats help children with Autism, people with depression and so much more. The cats just stroll about basking in the attention from visitors. It's a win win for everyone. Stop in and say hello to Melissa and her team and maybe you will meet your forever fur baby too."}
{"text":"CAAAAAAAAATS!!!!!!!!!!!!   Adorable lovely wonderful kittens and full grown cats and middle aged cats and all the cats who only give love and fuzzies and fun and goodness and happiness! 
The humans are also very nice and cheerful and lovely!
If you do not like cats, do not go here"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed hanging out with the adorable kitties and the staff was super sweet and helpful"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place!! Missy is amazing and if you like cats/kittens this is the place to adopt from!!!"}
{"text":"It is the most original and cute place I ever been in US. The kitties are in perfect shape and the environment is well designed to play with them and maybe find a new owner.
I totally recommend this place for cat lovers and maybe for those that want to discover why we love them :)"}
{"text":"I don't often make reviews on a place but I find it necessary to write about this wonderful place.  The ambience is what you would expect from a cat cafè; quiet, friendly, yet filled with excitement. The cats are almost all very sweet and the fact that adoptions are possible make this an even sweeter deal. We will definitely be by again soon!"}
{"text":"Me holding Charlie at La Gattara Cat Lounge & Boutique. The love and compassion both Misty and all of her guests has for these creatures is astounding. I saw 3 adoptions while I attended. Misty's love and commitment to her babies is deep and unconditional. The cats are friendly, the owner has an amazing personality, is knowledgeable about the kitties, and is fun to be around. I will be coming back forever and ever."}
{"text":"This was a very fun place to go and it was a nice alternative to shelter, letting people get to know cats before adopting them. Also allowed gave me the opportunity to fill my camera roll with an unhealthy amount of cats."}
{"text":"Don't laugh, but I totally waited a few days before writing my review because I wanted to be the 9th. *snickers*  

I found out about this cafe last Tuesday, thanks to Yelp and Yelp-migo, Haneen O. 2 days later, DD & I came down and spent an afternoon here. We did NOT want to leave. 

It's hidden in the back of a strip mall, but it was easy to find via GPS. When we arrived, there were about 5 others inside, enjoying the gatitos.  We immediately noticed that everyone's shoes were off to the side. As someone who leaves my shoes at the door in my home, I 100% understand (and agree with) this practice.  We were both wearing socks, but they do have spare socks in case anyone needs/wants them. They do allow you to go bare foot, if you so choose.   

We were greeted by an employee (I believe she said she was the manager) and asked if we had reservations.  We did not, but she said it was ok.  In the future, when it gets really busy, they will allow no more than 15 cat lovers in at a time, so making a reservation ahead of time is suggested and can be done on their website.

The price is $10 per person for an hour of playtime with the kitties. After paying, we sanitized and entered the kitdom. 

There were lots of kittens and some cats. Most of them were initially sleeping, but a few kitties were up, frolicking about. DD feel in love with Toffee, a most energetic little bundle of joy. 

The cats have a large open roam area with lots of pillows, toys, climbing structures, scratching boards, etc.  Water fountains and water bowls were found throughout to keep the kitties hydrated. The owner pretty much thought of everything to keep the kittens happy and comfy.

All cats are available for adoption, and you can read about each one on the adoption board or their website.  Act fast if interested, because I was told that some are already on \"reserve.\" There is a pair of big, beautiful, and inseparable ginger cats who want to go to the same forever home. I hope they get adopted together.  La Gattara works with Lost Our Home and adoption proceeds go to that organization.  

The cafe part is not yet open; they are a work in progress.  The owner plans to have baked goods in the cafe and she plans to offer regular and vegan options!  (You know I'm super excited about this!)

Spending time with these regal creatures was good for the soul. DD called it therapy. I love the safe space that Melissa has created for these babies. I wish this cafe much love and 9 lives of success!"}
{"text":"They have not officially opened yet, but have been doing a soft-opening until they can be fully operational. I went to one of their pop-up cafe/lounges to pet cats and it was great! I have only ever been to a cat cafe in Japan and LaGattara has a much more relaxed atmosphere since the objective is to socialize & adopt out the resident cats. The staff was very kind and friendly and greeted us when we came in, and interacted with other patrons.

I really recommend people to check out their events! They have been doing all kinds of things like painting nights, yoga, the pop-up cafes, etc. I can't wait until they are officially open!"}
{"text":"When I first found out this place was across the street from me I was very excited. My friends and I have made plans several times to go to the cafe. Each time despite their hours they were not open. One of the times the owner I guess was sitting outside in her car and saw our group looking in the window and she told us \"no one made a reservation\" so today we were going to make a reservation no one answered so we went to talk across the street to make it and there was a sign that said they will be closed until February 9th. You're going to leave the cats locked in there for over a week ? Yet again the place is not open I'm very disappointed and have given up on trying to come here. It's a great concept but is not being run by someone who cares."}
{"text":"Are you a cat because you're purrrrrrfect!

My heart is full of fluffy kittens!

What's a better way to spend your day off than playing with a bunch of cats and kittens?  Trick question, the answer is, \"nothing!\"  For $10/hr, you can surround yourself with gentle purrs and a choir of \"meows\" from cats looking for their Forever Home.  LaGattara is partnered up with Lost Our Home Pet Rescue and they have a clowder of cats and kindle of kittens waiting for a kind Yelper, such as yourself, to adopt them.  Take off your shoes, run around in socks [they supply a clean pair for you if you're not wearing any], and go have some fun!  It's therapeutic, even.

The cafe portion of the place isn't up and running yet but don't let that stop you from stopping by to boop some feline noses and play with their little toebeans.  There are a lot of events such as yoga, paint night, and even movie night being hosted here so check out their website.  This place is truly amazing and I hope that those looking for fur babies decides to stop in to adopt... don't shop!"}
{"text":"I made the pilgrimage to this cat cafe for the 1st time 2 days ago on an invite to their 21+ Ladies Night / Pure Romance / cat mingling evening of fun.  Cupcakes were served.
Founder Melissa Pruett devised the idea of having a cat cafe after visiting a cat cafe in another location.  She solicited funding from Kickstarter for 2 years.  The original name would've been La Gattara Cat Cafe but because she (still) needs more funding for more permits and space expansion for the cafe part (more varied food/drinks) especially, she changed it to La Gattara Cat Lounge & Boutique since it's more fitting.  La Gattara opened on a summer of last year.  Local artist Kate Benjamin designed the interior artwork and color scheme (baby pink & blue, with white and black).  There were art display from paint nights, and I especially loved the 2 silhouette cat shapes.  All About Animals rescue group supplies the kitties (all ages/sizes/shapes, purebred & mixed- from mellow to sassy) for adoption.  It's cage-free with the kitties roaming and hanging around as they well-please.  Reservations and walk-ins (up to 15 per visit) are welcome, but reservations are recommended.  $10 for 1 hour of cat mingling.  Other prices/freebies vary per event i.e. yoga, painting, and special events (drag queens, ladies night, holiday parties, birthdays).
'Cat Daddy' Jackson Galaxy from Animal Planet's My Cat from Hell series stopped by recently.
I had lots of fun interacting with the 25(?) adorable kitties and got to meet their mascot, Charlie Chaplin (with the bowtie), who oversees the lounge (and is not available for adoption).  They loved to play hide&seek, to be brushed, to sit with, and to pose for photos & videos with me- 2 of them followed me to the restroom and actually watched me ;)  I particularly liked this one senior boy (11 years) who looked like a Persian mix (beautiful eyes, BTW) who reminded me of my Gladys (who's a senior Himmie whom I adopted from another rescue center last January) ;)  It is an evening to be had =^..^= =^..^= =^..^= =^..^= =^..^= =^..^= =^..^=
I highly encourage you cat lovers to stop by and support the \"cat cafe\" mission to help adopt out the kitties in a cage- and stress-free environment that fosters social skills.  As a result, they have been successful at adopting out numerous kitties.  Also, please be kind and non-judgmental as it is a very busy center with a tiny staff and small budget that are still expanding- it's clean, but you may encounter a couple+ messes.  And, have fun!"}
