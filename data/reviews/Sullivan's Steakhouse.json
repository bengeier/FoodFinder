{"text":"Awesome service, and incredible food! We were at Alex's table and he was a great server. I was really impressed because most high end places take all night bring food thinking you want to be there the whole evening. They did a wonderful job keeping our pace moving through glasses of wine, apps, lobster bisque,  the main course and we were in and out in an hour and a half and had a tremendous experience. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Waitress was very helpful when asked for suggestions. But definitely a once on special occasion place because of pricing. Will definitely be back for next special occasion."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner here last night before the game with my two boys and their buddy. After making reservations I read some reviews, I picked a few excellent and then read the 2 poor and 3 terrible to get an idea of what could go wrong. Usually it's either a simple mistake or a staff looked at someone which they perceived wrong and they cop the \"I'm the big paying customer attitude\" when in fact the staff probably was clueless to the perceptions and still has no idea unless they read the review! I found this to be the case with these, don't get me wrong, service is important but if you start your review off with \"The food was well-prepared and tasted good\", there could possibly be a problem in the mirror! We had two cowboy ribeyes, a filet and sea bass. All plates were well prepared, good looking, and great taste. One of the first things you notice is that there are no salt or pepper shakers on the tables. This can be interpreted two ways; you choose. I strayed a bit from my usual French onion soup and got the butternut squash soup with cream and pumpkin seed. It was delicious but a little too sweet for my taste so my 16 year old finished it off. I ordered a house salad to get some acidity to counter act the sweet and it worked out well. Steaks came perfectly cooked, and looked amazing. My wife and I recently went to Flemings and the ribeye they served didn't look half as good as this one. Matter of fact the bone in at Texas Land and Cattle looks better than the Flemings steak. My son's friend also had the cowboy ribeye and his too looked amazing. It just makes for a better meal when your first impression is \"wow; that looks good\". The other dishes were well plated also. We accompanied the entrees with creamed spinach and steakhouse prepared mushrooms, both well prepared with sharp flavors.  Service, where most people had their problems, wasn't ours at all. The service couldn't have been better. Our waitress was kind, professional, and presented herself and Sullivan's with class. She wasn't overly attentive and didn't disappear for long periods, just right. Kudos to Katelin, we appreciate her professionalism and kindness in her service. She alone pushes the final rating to excellent. Go to Sullivan's and enjoy a great meal"}
{"text":"I have not yet experienced Sullivan's steaks, but have recently been to a Thursday night drink and entertainment night at their bar and patio. I was disappointed in their mixed drinks, bad enough that I switched to wine shortly thereafter; the entertainment was great though! Nice mix of patrons there as well. I will go again in hopes that it was just an \"off\" night for the bartenders."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! I love that it is located right out of the city so I don't have to mess with parking uptown. My favorite thing to do is come on a Thursday night for $6 bar food and drinks and then take the lightrail to the Common Market in South End or all the way into town for shows and games.  You can also host private events here! They make it really easy to do. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My go to place in Charlotte. I think it is the best steak in town. The lounge area is well done and the bar menu is fantastic if you're not in the mood for a massive meal. Always a pleasant crowd and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Took my BF for a steak dinner here.  The prices were reasonable for an upper-scale steakhouse, and the place appears to be known for its martinis, which we love, so off we went.  The steaks were great!  I got the filet, and the BF got the NY strip.  I think we both agreed that my steak was tastier, since it was so tender. I agree with the previous reviewer that they put a lot of pepper on the steaks, but I really thought it added to the flavor.  He got horseradish mashed potatoes on the side, which I thought were delicious.  I got a baked potato, which they dress for you table-side.  All the steaks are served with a wedge salad with blue cheese.  It was very tasty, although I thought it would be better with bacon -- perhaps you should ask for that on the side, if you go.  After dinner, we had Irish coffees.  Not on the dessert menu, but they were happy to oblige.  So, bottom line, how do I feel about this place?  OK, so a couple of things that I wasn't too jazzed about, and I felt like this impacted my general opinion about the restaurant service:  1) Our waitress was very nice, but scarce.  Wouldn't have been that big of a deal, except for....  2) My potato was not hot.  I know, I know, I'm being high-maintenance, right? But I don't think so.  I've decided to come here, pay for a $35 steak.  The least you can do is bring me a potato that's not ROOM TEMPERATURE.  Seriously.  I want to eat my $7 baked potato with the rest of my meal.  I had to wait a while before I could track her down.  Overall, the meal was good.  The ambiance is nice.  Steak is good.  I'd recommend going here -- just don't order the baked potato!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary there last Saturday.  The food was spectacular and the service was second to none.  Our server Luke was the absolute best!  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"So I'm having a steakhouse conversation with some friends and Sullivan's comes up...I know it's a chain, and I know there are more popular places in town, but if you have been here multile times, the overall consistency of the experience at Sullivan's stands out in my mind! I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal or service experience here. Of the upscale steakhouses (Del Frisco's, Beef and Bottle, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Palm, etc), Sullivan's may not rate as the best in each category (food, service, value, atmosphere), but I would put it 2 or 3 in each one - thus giving it the title of Charlotte's best steakhouse."}
{"text":"Amazing all around dining experience. Staff was knowledgable about the food and very friendly. Best steak I have had in a long time, plus Mac & cheese with lobster side was outstanding. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"decent, had to check it out as I have heard great things on Sully's from neighbors.   serve and food wad middle of the road."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite restaurant. The food is consistently excellent, the service is commendable, and my husband and I are always made to feel like we are special. Great place to take the family. Mike, the new manager, is phenomenal--greeted as we came in and left. Always try to insure that everything was 100% satisfactory. Our rating for this restaurant A+!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for dinner. It was recommended by the hotel. I personally don't like the fact hat you have to purchase everything separately. I expected he food to be much better than it was for the prices. Staff was not very friendly.  Expect more from a place that is suppose to be high end"}
{"text":"You want a great steak, a good bottle of wine and a nice place to enjoy it with experienced, knowledgeable staff?  Go to Sullivan's.  End of story."}
{"text":"Went to Sullivan's on Valentine's Day and was very disappointed.  Our reservations were 8:15pm.  We arrived at 8:00 to find the line for valet was wrapped around the block.  It seems to me that if you are aware it will be a busy time the valet situation would be better planned out.  There was a pre-fixed menu for the evening was fine but for $89 per person the steak should be tasty.  My date ordered his steak medium well and it was so tough he was unable to cut it.  My creamed spinach was cold and my date's mashed potatoes were very stiff.  There was a lady going from table to table taking pictures, however she never stopped by to ask us if we wanted a photo.  Yes I am African American and I never use the race card but it was very strange that she never came to our table.  I've been to Sullivan's before but this will be my final visit."}
{"text":"Just returned from an anniversary celebration dinner at Sullivan's. My wife and I had dined at Sullivan's before and it was actually quite good.  However, on this visit, my steak was not cooked properly.  I ordered a long bone dry aged ribeye, medium rare.  The steak was cooked medium at best and I would argue the beef was NOT dry aged.  I've ordered dry aged beef from Sullivan's in the past and it was a beautiful, ruby red color.  On this visit, my steak  was anemic.  I sent it back and received a properly cooked yet still anemic piece of meat.  It's protocol for fine steakhouses to ask customers to cut into their steaks to check that they are cooked to their liking.  This was not done at Sullivan's. I also noticed that the $59 \"dry aged\" ribeye I ordered became a $61 steak on the final bill.  Yes, it's only $2 but I wonder if that was a surcharge for me sending back my original steak. Quite disappointed.  Service was sub par. We were never brought plates for our appetizers.  We were also promised by our server that we would be getting complimentary champagne at the end of our meal for our anniversary.  This never happened. I had to flag down another server because ours had disappeared.  For this price point, I expect perfection in quality of beef, execution and service.  Sullivan's can learn so much from Del Frisco's. Sullivan's is lacking in attention to details.  I recommend you spend your hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I couldn't recommend Sullivan's more highly.   The food is exceptional, but at around $100/person that's expected. What wasn't expected was the service. I've never been treated so well at any restaurant. Our server Ashley was phenomenal.   I'm a bonafide cheapskate, and after spending $200 on a meal walked away feeling like it was a bargain."}
{"text":"I've been to fine establishments but this was nothing special and WAY OVERPRICED.  They nickel and dime you for everything.  For the Bearnaise sauce on the steak ....$3 ..... a diet coke .......$3.50 and so on and so forth.    The steak was good but nothing that I couldn't get somewhere else for less.  We didn't get out of there for less than $130 and that is just plain ridiculous!  That left a bad taste in my mouth.  Yes, I knew to expect pricey but it wasn't that worthy.  I will choose other places in the future."}
{"text":"Was seated as soon as we got here and service was excellent as not a glass remained empty the entire time we where here. Food was excellent, fresh and hot and all was cooked the way I like it. Another plus was the fresh and strong coffee."}
{"text":"Great food and great ambiance! Staff is knowledgeable of their menu options and on queue. Food is delicious and fresh- highly recommend this Steak and Seafood establishment!"}
{"text":"The first time I visited this location I was throughly pleased with the service and the quality of the meal. I decided to take a few friends with me this time and I was quite disappointed. I had the 12oz Filet Mignon, prepared medium rare, closer to the rare side. When it arrived I was upset when I cut into a medium cooked piece of meat. I brought it to our waitresses attention (who was very pleasant throughout our visit) and she took it back to be corrected right away. The weight wasn't long before the manager arrived with a new cut that was suppose to be prepared correctly this go around. Once again I was disappointed when I cut into another improperly prepared steak. I was too frustrated at the time to address it again, plus my company was already half way through their own meals. I enjoyed all other aspects of my meal except the steak and cheesecake. It's unfortunate that such a high quality restaurant can be so inconsistent with its food. Will give them one last shot, a best two out of three hopefully."}
{"text":"I eat here often and they have never disappointed.  Being from NYC, I'm a big fan of fine steak restaurants and Sullivan's has everything I want when good beef is called for.  The service is always great and they make me feel like a local."}
{"text":"Sullivans has won me back. We went for Christmas Eve.  The only problem was the reservation wasn't in the system but they got us in.  We got the Seafood Tower.  I had looked forward to the tower all week. I wasn't disappointed.  Crab, lobster tails, Shrimp Cocktails, and oyster were all fresh and delicious.  We had an excellent bottle of Viognier .  We all ate bacon wrapped scallops.  Yes, we ate seafood at a steak resturant because the get in fresh seafood several times a week.  We had the best service that we have ever had at Sullivan's.  I wish I could remember his name but he was originally from Ecuador.  He was attentive and gracious but not in our face.  It was a fabulous celebration for Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"This is my second review of Sullivan's. Last night we walked over to use a gift card issued us after our last unfortunate visit, Christmas Eve 2011.  We were going to what was to be a 'party' with drink specials and bar bites. Mostly what we found was 1/2 glass or inconsistent wine pours and no bar bites. We ordered a flatbread off the bar menu that came out cold and uncooked. As it turned out, the manager returned our gift card because it took so long for our food to come out.   The people sitting next to us at the bar had a 7:30 reservation for the dining room. When they arrived, they were told to wait in the bar, that it would be 8:00. It had to be closer to 8:30 before they were seated.  We walked to a local favorite and had dinner as we left hungry. Why is this local landmark so disappointing. We meet a friend at Sullivan's every Christmas Eve for dinner, it's a tradition. This year we will meet somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great service! They were very nice! My steak wasn't fully cooked how I asked and without me even saying anything a lady who might have been the manager walked over and asked me about my steak and if it's the color I wanted. I was honest but very nice about it saying i'll heat it up and have it for lunch the next day. She insisted on bringing me a new one. I declined. Ten minutes later she comes out with a whole new steak and sides and offers to box up mine for me. She assured me how she wants me to be fully happy and satisfied right then and there. Such exceptional customer service, It was also my anniversary and my waiter brought out free dessert which was so sweet and thoughtful. Love this place and I'm a regular especially for happy hour and take out!"}
{"text":"Sullivan's has always been on my list for \"must go to\" restaurants/steak houses; they certainly didn't disappoint. its located in the South End of Charlotte and offer complimentary valet but honestly if the weather isn't bad, save yourself the wait and tight space and just park a block over, adjacent from the restaurant and simply walk over.  I took advantage of Queens Feast/ restaurant week. They were behind on reservations (the only reason why they didn't get 5 stars) I think we were seated maybe 15-20mins after our scheduled reservation.  for a starter the lovely waitress recommended the seafood sampler... which by the way was bonkers (Crab legs & claws/ Colossal shrimp/ Fresh oysters/ Lobster tails). its fairly pricey though ($60 smh)  The first course consisted of the Shrimp & Lobster bisque which was good. nothing mind blowing. For the main entrée however, I go the 8oz. Hand-Cut Filet Mignon with  horseradish mashed potatoes and asparagus. I can honestly say that was one of the most delectable steaks I've ever had; it was cooked EXACTLY how I asked for it (medium) and you could literally cut it with a butter knife (I know because I tried and succeeded with little to no effort). I also added the signature Cajun butter on my steak with even more so enhanced the flavor that was already there. for dessert was both the New York Style Cheesecake (amazing w/ fresh strawberries) and the best Bananas Foster Bread Pudding I've ever had with Vanilla Ice Cream and Caramel sauce on the side. My date was literally trying to stab me with her fork because I kept attempting to steal a bite LOL."}
{"text":"Went into the bar and had to wait till a manager came around to get a beer. A beer later I had to ask a busboy for the check. No idea if the food is good, the bartender was terrible and if he doesn't wait on you, you have to go somewhere else! I went across the street to Luciano's and had a great experience!"}
{"text":"The best and most elegant of all the pricy steakhouses. Definitely worth a try for Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"I have only been to this restaurant for the happy hour. It's wonderful! Flavorful, strong drinks and very flavorful food. The live jazz and dim lighting make for a great ambiance."}
{"text":"Pricey. Its a fancy atmosphere with not-so-great food and service. I expected more for my money."}
{"text":"We went for the first time to celebrate our 2 birthdays.   From the friendly greeting to the amazing server (Austin) to the 2 managers who checked in on us (and brought us roses for our birthdays),  it was just a stellar experience from start to finish.  This was our first time here and I would recommend to anyone looking for top notch service and amazing food.  Lots to recommend from the knockout drink to the ribeye and filet to the creme brûlée.  Thanks to Sullivan's for making this a special night!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service is slow. Food is slow. Everything was served cold and they needed more help. I don't get it. And apparently other people don't either. It's a Friday night at 7:30 and the place is dead."}
{"text":"I haven't been there in a while  but this place was my fave. I wish they open one in all corners of Charlotte. It's a steak house with a few feathered in fine choices of seafood,  love the oyster and .y fave of all ahi tuna sashimi grade. Yummy"}
{"text":"I contacted Sullivan's ahead of time to let them know I would be proposing.  They went out of their way to save us a choice table!  The manager came out to personally congratulate and give us free champaign and dessert.  Now to the food review.  WOW!  The filet was incredibly tender, juicy, and delicious.  They did a magnificent job of giving the filet just enough seasoning to still allow the flavor of the steak itself to shine through.  The sides and dessert were to die for.  We loved the atmosphere and decor!  What a romantic place to go for an excellent dinner.  Don't forget to leave the kids at home ;)"}
{"text":"I've read a few of the reviews and I must say, any rating below 4 stars is insane.  My experience at this restaurant was nothing less than outstanding.  My wife brought me here as an early birthday celebration, and the atmosphere was very cool. They had a small talented band that provided background music which added to ambiance of the place.  The service was great from the time that we entered the door until we left. The waitress that we had was very nice, always communicated with us in regards to receiving our order, and she was incredibly helpful. Now as far as the food goes, simply amazing.  The Shrimp and lobster bisque is just sooooooo good along with the ahi tuna with the cucumber and ginger.  And ofcourse this being a steakhouse the steaks have to be on point. I had the New York strips and I must say that the steak juicy, tender, and full of flavor. My one and only complaint is the fact there was this group that was extremely loud but the fact the tables were close didn't really affect my dinning experience.  All and all, this is a great restaurant and I would recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"Well after many attempts to try this well known establishment we finally made it. Not to shabby but do have some complaints. At first, service was impeccable. But then, we were left for long periods of time and I had to go without coffee a couple of times and had to resort to the ice water to wash my food down messing up the flavor ratio that I was enjoying with the coffee. Anywho, we went during restaurant week and did order from that menu. We both had the same thing which was the iceberg lettuce wedge with the homemade blue cheese dressing for what was considered the first course and then the 8 oz filet with the horseradish mashed potatoes and sautéed  green beans for the second course and finally the bananas foster bread pudding with caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream. The wedge was o.k. as the homemade blue cheese dressing wasn't any better than what I could make at home. Hence \"Homemade\" I assume. The filets we order well-done and have had disastrous results at other places but there have been a few that actually know how to cook a well-done steak and not let it become dry and disgusting. This wasn't one of those places, or at least not when we went. We found that the cook had gashed opened our filets to see if they were in fact well-done and anyone who knows anything about cooking steak will agree that the last thing one should do is cut into a freshly cooked steak as it will lose most of the juices. This is exactly what occurred here. What a shame too. The sautéed green beans where very crunchy and could have stayed in the pan a bit longer. The mashed potatoes were more than likely the best thing about the whole meal. I really cannot think of a thing wrong with them other than there could have been more of them. They were very good. And last but not least, The bread pudding. I wouldn't order this again as it came out room temp. and the first bite had me at \"a little stale\". It could, and should, have been much better. Especially for the type of place this is supposed to be. What time the waitress did spend with us, she was warm and welcoming plus very helpful in answering all our questions. We will have to come and give them another chance after all the fuss and muss of this restaurant week passes. Maybe when it is a time that they are not offering specials so we can see if there is a difference in the regular menu food and service as opposed to the price you pay for the specials. Is it one of those times when you get what you pay for?"}
{"text":"At first I was excited to see a local volunteer group scheduled our social for this location.  I left hungry and annoyed.  The good: nice bar area, they had a great duo or trio playing a stand up bass and nice music.   The bad: we ordered from the bar menu, which had good prices and seemed like a good idea.  It was not.  I ordered the \"best burger in Charlotte\" which turned out to be a seriously salty, dry, hard burger.  I ate a few bites thinking it might get better.  It didn't.  The home-made chips were not salty at all, cold, and tasted like they were cooked in old oil.  Not pleasant.  My friend ordered a \"steak\" dish which looked completely unappetizing and she said was just about all gristle.    I won't go back and would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went during restaurant week. It annoys me when restaurants use that as an excuse, but I think it's a fair disclosure in a review.  Food was worth at least 4.5 stars -- maybe 5. Our waitress was wonderful; she provided practical advice regarding food selections, even as we tried to figure out how to navigate the menu given the option of the restaurant week prix-fixe choices. We each had the kale salad, which had wonderful ingredients, though the creamy dressing took away from the natural tastes of the kale, pecans, and dried berries. I had a 12-ounce filet, which was quite well-prepared. I like steak cooked medium-well, which earns glares from foodies and so I often get a lower-quality barrel-cut filets (as I did on this night), but it was cooked perfectly and I didn't notice the extra fat or toughness that this cut sometimes has. My wife had the 6 oz filet from the prix-fixe menu. Horseradish mashed potatoes on her plate had a \"seafood restaurant\" kind of flavor, but she ate some of my baked potato, which was enormous and yet perfectly cooked, which is often hard with the largest potatoes.  Two stars because the front-of-house management was not good and left a bad taste in our mouths for the night overall. Valet service was required, though there was ample parking right in front of the restaurant (that had been blocked off for the valet service). That wouldn't have been awful (it is free) except that when we exited, there were seven or eight cars backed up waiting to be parked and one harried valet attendant running to and fro. He paid no attention to us or the four other groups waiting for their cars, so I went over and told him to give me my key and tell me where my car was. That worked out nicely, actually, because my car was pretty close. If you're not going to let me park my car, though, you'd better have the valet process down cold.  The hostess and seating attendant were young girls who seemed to think it was their job to protect the restaurant from people they deemed insufficiently cool. I didn't feel welcomed, and they were not prepared to seat us at our reservation time (they didn't apologize, but said, \"you can wait in that corner\" and pointed to the three square foot area next to the walkway to the bar. When the seating attendant took us to our table, she started clanking around the extra glasses and silverware (the table had been set for 4 rather than 2), though she left them all cluttered up there anyway, and didn't give us enough menus.   The restaurant is too crowded -- tables are squeezed together to maximize revenue, I suppose -- and was quite loud: so much so that my wife and I had trouble understanding each other across a corner booth table (we're in our thirties -- not hard of hearing or anything).  Quite good food, but Sullivan's is a \"special event\" kind of restaurant, and there are places in town that create a special night out kind of experience, so I wouldn't go back to Sullivan's."}
{"text":"Today was my birthday. We had a quiet table at the end of the lunch shift. Our server, Shelly S, was especially attentive and upbeat. The steak salad I ordered was perfect; my husband thought his Cobb salad was the best he has tasted. Sullivan's is a special occasion restaurant - Shelley even took a photograph for remembrance of the day. She brought the framed photo to our table, inscribed with her words \"sending love and light your way.\" How special is that?  Yes, incredible personalized service. We highly recommend Sullivan's Steakhouse in Charlotte, North Carolina."}
{"text":"Dined here with my daughter during a weekend visit to NC.  Loved our experience.  The food was great, absolutely great drinks, with a lovely interior, small but very nice atmosphere.  Service was excellent. Also noticed the nice bar area, with a lounge and live music.  Will definitely return to dine next time in Charlotte.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I went to Sullivan's Steakhouse during restaurant week in Charlotte. I have to say the really do give you your $30 worth of food, unlike some other steak houses with the similar promotion.  I had the Cesar salad which was just what a Cesar salad should be. For the main course of coarse I had the fillet, that was cooked to perfection, dessert was the banana's foster bread pudding (worth going back for just that),  Our Waitress was wonderful. All the girls ordered a glass of wine and they were out of two of the options. The waitress came back with similar wines and charged the same price for the glasses. She also told them if they wanted something different to ask. This was a great move on her part, no one was without a drink the whole meal!  Overall great place, not sure about the regular prices, but $30 was perfect for me!"}
{"text":"I took three family members to Sullivans for a celebratory meal on friday evening. The dining room was so loud that we could not converse.The salad was tastless and the steak highly salted. But the biggest disappointment was no jazz music as advertised. I even phoned four hours  prior to verify the music.This was important to me as one of my guest's is a jazz muscian of some reputation.I will mot return to Sullivan's and now will be going to Captial Grill as before."}
{"text":"Sullivan's lives up to it's name here, for the most part. The seared ahi appetizer was very flavorful, just the right amount of spice. The meat consistency was a little off, but the abundance of flavor made up for this minor detail. The deviled eggs, while as good as a deviled egg can be, I'd not worth the $9 for four halves. French onion soup is exquisite, and the wedge salad is perhaps the best I've ever had. The bleu cheese dressing is absolutely spot on and plentiful.  Peppered strip streak, medium-rare, cooked perfectly and tastes very good. The filet, also some to perfection, was hit or miss. One tasted so-so all the way through, the other had the gristle still attached and was half decent, the other half very good. All sides very good, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, potatoes au gratin, shrimp cocktails. Desserts tried, key lime pie, apple crumble, and cheesecake were all excellent. However, the key lime did have mixed reviews. All in all, service was impeccable, the atmosphere is just a little loud (however the place was packed), meats overall very good, and will return if in the area again. The Kansas City Sullivan's is better steak-wise; however, the 5-star is still earned here."}
{"text":"So I have to say having eaten at every good steak restaurant in Charlotte, this is my least favorite.  Let me start by saying I came during restaurant week, but to me that's the time when a restaurant shines impress me when you are slammed and I will definitely come back.  That said I am not impressed, first of all my ceaser salad had chewy croutons, not exactly sure how you go wrong with a crouton.  Secondly my steak was very mediocre, and honestly I could have had similar at Texas road house etc, honestly if i was paying full price I would probably be a lot more annoyed.   Sorry Sullivans but you could learn a lot from your sister restaurant Del Frisco, which not only remains my favorite but also is one of the best places for restaurant week."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with coworkers. Not the best experience. A little pushy with their service and food. Needed many water refills because they just kept adding more ice to my cup than water. Ordered the fish tacos and immediately after the first bite my stomach was rumbling. Coworker also felt that their salad was overdressed and did look too heavy. Another coworker complained about the steak not being cooked right. I did not try the desert because my stomach was still not happy with my entree so I couldn't tell you how the desert tasted. The table was not an even surface, but of course was draped nicely in white cloth to cover, so I had to constantly adjust my glass on the table so it wouldn't spill. The chairs were too heavy and took up too much space. Music in bathroom was too loud. Location is inconvenient to pull out from.  Overpriced and overrated. I will not return and will not recommend."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Met a friend for drinks and ate from the bar menu. She said her burger was super salty and the homemade chips were stale. My tavern steak was a lot of gristle, although the sauce and sautéed spinach and mushrooms were good. The prices were good ($6 for each), but if you're using low quality or leftover ingredients, what's the point?"}
{"text":"Always our old standby for date night. Service is always the best. We have gone to Sullivan's for every anniversary for the past 10 years plus birthdays. Glad to have a fabulous restaurant in the neighood."}
{"text":"Terrible meal- ordered my steak medium, and it came out like a charcoal pellet. Not only was it well done, it was cooked well beyond well done (inexcusable for a steak restaurant). They had turned a 40+ dollar filet into the texture and toughness of shoe leather. The other guest ordered a ribeye, and her steak quality was subpar. If you are going to spend this much money on a steak dinner, go to Capital Grille. Will never return."}
{"text":"Upscale steakhouse restaurant with great food and ambiance... Try the she crab soul and great lunch specials...One my favorite date night or special occasion place..."}
{"text":"Excellent, classic steakhouse.  I had the privilage of going while my boyfriend's boss was picking up the tab, so that was a huge plus for me.  The food was great!  I had a mushroom duxelle filet with creamed spinach and white cheddar au gratin potatoes.  My steak was cooked perfectly and it had a goat cheese butter melted over the top that was to die for.  The steak really was delicious, but that sauce could have been served over an old sneaker and made it taste good.  The side dish portions are HUGE and definitely shar-able.  The table had oysters rockefeller, crab cakes, and calamari for appetizers and there was plenty to go around for all of us (table of 9).  The calamari are some of the best I have ever eaten.  They are gigantic, not rubbery at all, and have that fresh seafood melt-in-your-mouth quality.  The piece de resistance for me, however, was their signature Knockout martini.  They infuse chunks of pineapple in orange vodka for over a week and then crush it up, put it over ice, and strain the concoction into a martini glass.  Yowza....it is awesome!  Definitely pricey, but well worth it.  Good, solid food and our service was top-notch."}
{"text":"Another wonderful meal from Sullivan's! The Knockout Martini is a great starter and the Filet is cooked well and with great flavor. Ryan did a great job behind the bar. This remains one of my favorite steakhouses and it does not disappoint."}
{"text":"We went there for our anniversary a few weeks ago. The service is prompt but he didn't know what kind of steak they were serving us, had to ask the chef. He came back with a general response, it's prime meat...uh..okay!!! The food was decent but it wasn't the fancy experience we were hoping for. Overall, an okay experience."}
{"text":"Anniversary Dinner was great. Amber greeted us with a smile and was very friendly even saying happy anniversary.  Bob was assigned to our table and he was great.  All his food suggestions were great. Crabcake appetizer was amazing.  Trout stuffed with crab meat ummm ummm good.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. Great salmon! Nice atmosphere. Wouldn't recommend this place for a lunch destination. A little on the slow side."}
{"text":"Best steak and martinis in Charlotte! Our favorite place to eat. Filet trio is my go to. It's not on the menu but it is one of their specials frequently, if it isn't they will make it for you. My husband always gets the bone in filet, and it is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I just went out with a friend to this place last week.  I did read some comments from Yelpers as it's my first time.  Firstly, I was disappointed with the parking there.  Suit... I almost left as I drove round the whole parking building three times with no spot.  Ending up I had to use their valet.  Perhaps, this is to create jobs,  Tell our forecoming President.  I may be picky (you may say)  I'm half Jewish and I only do not eat pork or shell fish, besides due to my job, I see lobster and good food everyday, I did not have many choices of appetizer.  I picked steak tartar whatever but I did not like the taste as there was only meat taste.  I saw my friend order oyster that looked good.  We shared a porter house steak but he did not order any side.  (He was to pay and this was the first time eating out with him, I was observing.)  The meat was cooked to our choice - good.  For the others, wait till I go out with another friend and try again.  I see that the menu does have good items.  Good try.  The price???  Mummmm depending with where you want to compare. Feel like eating at Sheraton or Marriott Hotel.   It is pricey.  In California, you can get better price for this standard. But definitely, a place that you can show off a little bit if you are dating someone.  Haha!!  Overall, a place of class except the parking.  BTW, someone say casual dress, fortunately I always dress proper to any dinner.  Otherwise, I will be very embarrassed.  Perhaps the night I went there had lots of either company party or business people.  Sorry, am I too sarcastic???"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Charlotte!  Bar area was packed and fun with a lot of energy... it's a place to go at least once a week!"}
{"text":"My experience was a 1 star! My friend had Tuna and loved it. That was the saving grace for the 2 stars.  The ambiance was nice. They had comfortable booths and nice art.  It was too loud for a nice conversation. Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating.  Drinks were made well and had the perfect amount of strength.   Bread and butter - very good! They use Real butter!!  Green beans - Too salty Mac n cheese - Disgusting, tasted smoked Cream of corn - Only ok, I've had better  Tuna - My friend said, incredible!"}
{"text":"This steakhouse is fantastic. They're extremely accommodating. The staff is outstanding. G, Faith and Juda the bartenders are some of the best I've ever met. Travis the manager is extremely friendly and treats all of the guests here excellent. The food is phenomenal. Highly recommend going in on any night, sitting at the bar and having dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"YUM-ME! The steaks at this place are pretty awesome. I ordered the steak and lobster tail and got pretty full. Their specialty drinks are awesome. My friend ordered a couple of side dishes, but I was too full to eat any of them."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Loved the cheesesteak egg rolls, iceberg salad and ribeye! We tried all sides and they were equally yummy. Especially the mushrooms ! Our table setup was angled oddly, but we made it work."}
{"text":"This is my #3 steakhouse in Charlotte and yes, for me, it's still 5 stars. You might say I've never been to a steakhouse I didn't like, but that would not be true, as there are a few out there. Sullivans has a great bar area w/music and a cool outdoor patio open year round. Can't beat the specials on Thursday & Sunday nights. Sunday they do their $30 3-course meal along with $5 Knockout Martini, which is similar to the stoli-doli at Cap Grille. Same drink special on Thursday with cheap bar bites.   The menu is awesome and the wine list extensive. I always order the filet and onion rings...yep, great combo. Wine or scotch...or both?! Great for special occasions or just a late meal. Try it on a Sunday...always busy after Panthers games."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night, first time since the remodel. The bar area seemed nicer but I have to admit I preferred the charm the restaurant had before. My wife had the Filet it was tasty. I had Lobster tails they were also yummy. 1 thing I found weird was the clarified butter was real thick (not typical) I did not care for it. Our server was sort of an odd older gentleman. He did do his best, but sort or Over pushed a bottle of wine...it was pretty funny. All in all the visit was fine but not sure it was worth the money with so many other choices."}
{"text":"I also tried Sullivan's during restaurant week. I would not return. The meal began as a disappointment and ended that way.   I began my meal with a Caesar salad. The salad was large but the lettuce was wilted and the croutons were soggy. It was apparent they had prepared the salads much earlier that day, croutons and all, and placed it in the refrigerator. It may have even been prepared the day before. Before our salad plates were removed from the table our steaks were brought out with no where to place them. The four of us literally had to hold up out salad dishes while they placed our steaks on the table.The steak was cooked to order but the potatoes that were served with it had so my much horseradish in them they were inedible. The cheesecake was warm and pretty much tasted like a Sara Lee purchased from the grocery store.   Our service wasn't much better. The waiter whizzed by a couple of times and asked if everything was ok. Each time his hands were full and he never came to a complete stop.   At first I blamed restaurant week, but have been to numerous restaurants over the years and have never experienced such a disappoint. I will never return to Sullivan's and would NOT recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Our server, Lauren, was awesome.  She had great recommendations for beverages and dinner.  We were there celebrating our anniversary and had a great time.  We had the Filet feature with mac and cheese, creamed cheese (a must order!), gnocchi and mushrooms (there were too many great sides to choose from!).  We have eaten here many times and it has never disappointed.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!  They brought us a complimentary dessert since we were celebrating.  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Thank you Natasha and Sullivan's! What a wonderful experience we had for our son and daughter-in-law's Rehearsal Dinner there last Friday night. We could not have been happier with how it all turned out. Natasha was such a pleasure to work with - her attention to detail, professionalism and helpfulness went above and beyond. She made sure everything was perfect for our event, right down to helping us decorate the private room (which took almost 4 hrs. but looked beautiful when finished!) and attending to our every need. Our three servers, (Spencer, Evan and Amy) were excellent and the food was delicious. All of our guests had a wonderful time and the evening was a huge success! I would highly recommend Sullivan's for your next special event and cannot say enough about their event planner Natasha Demaio and the expert care she took to help ensure our guests had a wonderful evening and our very special dinner was a perfect event!"}
{"text":"Nice low-key steakhouse. Easy to drive right past if you're not looking closely for their sign. Offers valet parking. Cheesesteak eggrolls are BOMB! A la carte sides were lacking, we did the season-less broccoli and an gratin potatoes, which more closely resembled a smashed plain baked potato. Salmon Rockefeller was phenomenal and Hubby liked his Oscar style filet, but said there are better available here in Charlotte. Overall, super awesome experience. Love the cozy, intimate seating and friendly staff. Seemed to be very accommodating to the large group that was there during our time too! Give Sullivan's a try!"}
{"text":"Had a really good filet mignon and scallop potatoes! Really great service too! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was great, service wasn't bad. A little over priced for their servings but overall satisfied"}
{"text":"Sullivans is a classic - excellent food and superior service, anytime but restaurant week."}
{"text":"Passing through Charlotte on business and decided to try Sullivan's.  It is a good, solid steakhouse.  I had the Kansas City Bone-In Strip and it was perfectly cooked and tender, unfortunately, a little too much pepper.  Otherwise the sides were tasty: White Cheese Au Gratin Potato and Asparagus.  I liked the dark interior with hints of art deco.  The service was prompt, attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to Sullivan's in Baton Rouge and had excellent service every time- the waitresses and bartenders were prompt and very cordial. I went here this evening in Charlotte and ate at the bar...my meat was cooked incorrectly, the bread was the last item to hit the table, and I was overcharged for an additional beer by the bartender. When I asked for the beer (since I had not received it), I got blown off.   Upsetting. Not sure I'll go back. Be careful of your bill if you do."}
{"text":"First off, let me say that our waiter Chris was genuinely THE BEST waiter either of us have ever had. He was so amazing and attentive. When he asked what brought us here, we said we were visiting from out of town and heard good things. He went completely out of his way to make the meal special for us - he brought me a rose (although he claimed my man gave it to him to give to me;)), was super friendly and checked in on us throughout the meal, and gave us a free dessert to take home with us. He was literally the best and I can see why they put new servers with him! Secondly, the food - OMG. Amazing. Steaks are the best we ever had in our life! Try the New York strip with the bourbon peppercorn sauce - it was actually my date's food but I kept stealing bites! My filet was wonderful as well. The mashed potatoes were delicious and even the bread they give you as you sit is tasty too! And you must try the calamari as an appetizer! Chris recommended it to us and it was the yummiest calamari I've ever eaten. Honestly everything at Sullivan's is the best I've ever eaten. We live four hours away but we agreed we're making special trips to Charlotte for this steakhouse. We love Sullivan's!"}
{"text":"Another great meal at Sullivan's and it just happened to be our anniversary.  After being asked a couple of times if we were celebrating a special occasion we gave in and told them it was our anniversary.  Well what was already a delightful dinner was made even better by the congratulations from many staff members and the complementary dessert and champaign along with a picture to commerate the occasion. It seemed a little corny at the suggestion, but we went along with it and it turned out well and they customized it with our details.  Overall it made for a great time.  It wasn't our first anniversary celebration there and will definitely not be our last."}
{"text":"I've frequented Sullivan's many times for lunch but this was my first dinner there.  We took advantage of their 20 year celebration and a special they had.  My husband had the prime rib and it was cooked perfectly rare.  I ordered the salmon rockefeller.  The salmon was on a bed of spinach and topped with Bearnaise sauce, bacon, and crab.  It was very rich and very good.  We both had one side with our entree and couldn't finish it all.  The cocktails were great and the service was awesome.  Jess took great care of us.  We ordered our dessert to go and because we were there celebrating my husband's birthday she brought him out some ice cream on a decorated plate."}
{"text":"We love going to Sullivan's.  I have been to the one in King of Prussia, PA (1) in Chicago (1) and the one in Charlotte (6).  We love jazz and this is the best place in Charlotte we have found to check it out, even better than Blue.  We like that we can go eat formal in the main dining area or take advantage of the happy hour and bar menu hanging out listening to jazz all night.  We have been there 6 times in 2011 and plan to go at least 1 Saturday per month moving fwd.  Considering it is close to an hour from our house, you can tell that we enjoy going to Sullivan's.  Service is great.  Jazz is great.  The food is an 8 out of 10.  Fairly pricey and you get more or less what you would expect.  We take friends with us about 50% of the time and they have all loved going and talk about it afterwards."}
{"text":"Previously, I have only been to Sullivan's to hang out in the cocktail area & order from the bar menu, but this review is for dinner in the dining room.    Now, generally, when I get to pick the place, my first choice would NOT be a chain restuarant, even an upscale one.  But, as it turns out, we had a gift card that could be used at either Del Frisco's or Sullivans. So, I went online to research menus ahead of time. Based on the menu (specifically the Ahi Tuna steak entree) I decided that we should go to Sullivans.      Needless to say, I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED to learn that they were out of Ahi tuna since that was the whole reason I decided to opt for Sullivans.  BUMMER!!  (I could see a smaller locally owned place running out of a popular menu item, but a huge corporate chain like Sullivans should have a better idea from their POS system about how much of certain items to keep on hand in the restarurant at any given time.)  So, I purused the menu to explore my options...sadly for those who don't eat steak (like me), the rest of the seafood or poultry options were not really exciting.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  But, as a small consolation prize, they had the Knockout martini on special for $6 (which normally is around $12)... so I started with that.  The knockout is made of clementine vodka that has fresh pineapple steeping in it for at least a week.   It was somewhat sweet, but not cloyingly so. I enjoyed it very much. 4.5 stars.   I decided to opt for one of the Sunday Prime-time specials.  For $34 a person, you can select one item from each of the following categories (however, beware, they have fairly limited options in each category):  (1.) Salad or soup,  (2.) An entree, (3.) A side dish, and  (4.) Dessert.  To go with my entree, I ordered with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  For $8, I got a fairly generous pour of an ok wine. 3 stars.   I started with the wedge salad.  3.5 stars.  The salad was huge and slathered with lots of bleu cheese dressing and a little finely chopped tomato. (At least they aren't one of those restaraurants that feels compelled to automatically throw bacon on everything.  I was glad this salad comes without.)  For my entree, I went with the salmon w/buerre blanc sauce.  The salmon was a decent size and thankfully was not overcooked. The sauce wouldn't have been my first choice if there were other options, but it tasted fine.  Overall, I would give this item 4 stars.   The side dishes on the special menu are very limited, and unfortuantely didn't include asparagus.  So, I went with the only other green option, the creamed spinach.  This dish was loaded with parmesan cheese and cream. It was ok, but I couldn't eat much of it because it was way too rich. 3 stars.   The dessert was fairly disappointing from my standpoint.  I love a good bread pudding, so I was excited about trying the Bannas Foster bread pudding.  This was made in individual ramekins and had a couple of slices of bananas in it.  It was also topped with ice cream, whip cream, and a drizzle of what looked like a carmel sauce.  Sadly, it was not very flavorful and the bread pudding had almost a rubbery texture. 2 stars.    David also got the wedge salad and chose the filet mignon for his entree.  He said the steak was over-salted.  He also chose mushrooms for his side and I tasted them - they were also a little over-salted. I couldn't eat more than a couple of these. For his dessert, he got the cheesecake to take home, since our server told us that we might want to split one dessert in house and take the other one to go (this  was a good suggestion because otherwise, it would be way too much!)  He also ordered a Highland Oatmeal Porter to go with his steak.   Our server was nice, but the service was only ok - not great. One small thing we noticed is that some tables had bread served to them and some (like ours) did not.  Since this was my first time eating in the dining room at Sullivans, I don't know if you were supposed to order the bread, or if the server just forgot to bring it.  (Not a huge deal, but it would have been a nice touch.)   Another small thing I noticed was no manager going around the dining room to greet patrons.   Overall, I was just not impressed given that our total bill came to $94 before tip.     I would come back here to meet friends for cocktails & casual bites from the bar menu, but I would not come back for a full-fledged dinner.  There are just too many other great restaurants in Charlotte to choose from at this price point."}
{"text":"Five stars- all the way!!! Excellent wine list, appetizers, sides, desserts, and most importantly- steak! Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Sullivan's was perfectly decent.  We were there on a Wednesday night, and the place was packed.  It was so loud, my husband and I could barely hear each other.  We both did the Prix Fixe.  I had shrimp cocktail, shrimp & lobster bisque, and the 6 oz filet oscar style.  Hubby had calamari, shrimp & lobster bisque, and an 8 oz filet.  I also ordered a side of macaroni and cheese for us to share.  Both of our apps were good.  The shrimp and lobster bisque had a really nice and complex flavor.  I probably enjoyed it most of all, but it could have used more seafood pieces.  Our steaks were fine, but really nothing to get too excited about.  The oscar topping flavor was too overpowering, in my opinion.  I liked the horseradish mashed potatoes.  The mac and cheese was actually shells and cheese...I don't recommend it.  It wasn't bad, but I've had better for a lot less money.  Dessert was on the house since it was my birthday.  Our server suggested the bread pudding, but I went with the s'mores cake because I wanted chocolate.  I probably should have gone with her suggestion.  The s'mores cake was more of a s'mores pie, and was rather underwhelming.  The service was okay.  There were times when my husband's sweet tea sat empty, which I don't think is okay when you're paying so much for a meal.  All in all, it was fine, but overpriced for the quality of the food and service.  Next time we want to do a high-end steakhouse, we will try a different place."}
{"text":"Excellent service !!  Live music outside on the patio.   Loved the kale salad !   I had the salmon,,  so good.    It has been remodeled since I was there before  great bar area ,,  they have small rooms for meetings.     Great sides creamed spinach,  mac and cheese and creamed corn is fantastic"}
{"text":"When I first went to Sullivan's 10+ years ago, I treated it as an upscale \"I need to dress to impress\" steakhouse. The second time I went (last year, thinking the same way), I had my boyfriend dress up. Well, when we got there, people had on shorts & flip-flops! Ah well, I digress...  The steaks are yummy & the a la carte sides are delicious. I went with the caesar salad, filet mignon, creamy horseradish mashed potatoes & green beans. My bf got filet mignon, creamed spinach & the same mashed potatoes. So delightful!  The staff is very attentive, the restrooms & restaurant are clean. The bar out front is very relaxed & I love that they have jazz sometimes.  The patio is nice, as well.  Sullivan's is quite pricey, so I have to reserve it only for special occasions."}
{"text":"First off I've been to Sullivan's a hundred times in Raleigh and a couple times at this location in Charlotte.  I don't know what it is but I guess I just pick the worst nights to come here.   The first time they told me it would be a 45 min wait and I waited 2 hours before I was seated just to find out they were basically out of everything on the menu.  I actually banned coming back until I was invited here for a Christmas dinner this year.  I know this is a very busy time a year in the restaurant business but when you pay this much for food - I expect   1.)  Appetizers to not take 45 min to come out & be cold 2.) Waiter to not throw away our leftovers after we have asked for a box 3.) When the man at the table already seems annoyed by your service and then you persist on throwing the dessert menu in his face (let's just say not a good move on your part) *he is paying the bill  It sucks because I really like Sullivans steak and in Raleigh I have always been happy with my food and service."}
{"text":"Sullivan's is Great.  I like the dark setting and the boxing decor.  This was probably my fourth time here and I just noticed a serious old school boxing championship belt on the wall near the hostess podium.  Pretty sweet.  Anyway, we went last Sat night and we were seated fairly quickly (with reservations).  We were celebrating a birthday and it appeared there were about 2 or 3 other birthday's going on that night as well so it was full of large groups.  Not a problem.  They were doing the restaurant week menu and everyone opted for that.  I had the \"Steak and Potatoes\" option.  Medium rare.   The steak came out nicely and they chilled a red wine for us that someone at our table had specifically asked for. Seasonings were good on the food and good char on the steak.  The dessert options were limited for Restaurant week, but the chocolate mousse was a nice finish.  The server was friendly and attentive.  Although there is one woman who is my favorite.  Cant remember her name.  She is on the top section.  The service was not too slow and they did not rush us either.  Even though we end up spending about two hours there.    I still really like Del Friscos even though it is overpriced, but I think Sullivans may have won me over."}
{"text":"I took my parents for restaurant week, as they just moved to the area. We waited 45 minutes for a table, even with a reservation. Our meals were good but our waiter was for some reason short and somewhat curt with us (my friend dining with us used the word \"snarky,\" which is also fitting). It felt like he didn't really want to be there, and certainly not serving us. I wish we had gone to Capital Grille instead, I find they always treat you like royalty."}
{"text":"This is the best Sullivan's I have been to.  The Bartender, Luke, is VERY knowledgeable, and friendly.  I eat here for lunch about once a week, and am there for dinner every now & again.    I have yet to have a bad meal.  Service is always very friendly, and if something does go wrong (happened 1 time) the management was extremely understanding & helpful.  For my money, it rarely gets better than Sullivan's in Dilworth - for the complete package."}
{"text":"Very nice. Straight forward, rather English in decor...  they have a room downstairs for banquets and groups that is very nice. The meat choices are fresh and deliciously prepared, in fact I would say on par with Morton's and Ruth's Chris at a slightly more palatable price point. The staff was very professional and everything was nicely done.  A good solid dining experience."}
{"text":"We loved the live music. Good customer service. A great dinner deal for two. Most of all, we were  really content with the food. We hope to visit again in the near future."}
{"text":"I don't normally give five stars but will in this case. Everything was great at this place while in town this weekend.   Love the location, south end with a lot of good places to chose from to eat and drink. Right off the light rail which we took from downtown.   We wanted to watch March madness so we sat outside with perfect weather.  Started out with the wedge and also we ordered a kale salad.  Pretty standard for steakhouses  We got the ribeye and New York cooked perfectly medium rare with mushrooms and hash browns for sides.  Also a side of bernaise for both.  Mushrooms were amazing and the steaks had just the right amount of seasoning.   Good drinks, food, service, and atmosphere.  Can't wait to get up to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great place to eat the employees are excellent, and great atmosphere Samantha is extremely professional"}
{"text":"I went to Sullivan's for lunch today.  The food was pretty good- but the service had a lot of room for improvement.  I went in at about 12:30 PM and sat at the bar.  There were a few other patrons in the restaurant.  The bartender was friendly enough, but not overly engaging.  But it was clear that the servers did not have their collective act together today.  Here are a few examples:  1.  Although sitting at the bar, the food always came in on the side with someone literally scaring me the first time they presented food at the table. 2.  The bartender, from approximately ten or so feet away, called at me \"do you want bread and butter?\" 3.  The phone must have rang ten times before anyone answered it even though there was someone at the door (where the phone was located) who welcomed persons in. 4.  Even though I saw a bunch of other servers and the place was not really very busy, the bartender was serving and busing other tables instead of taking care of customers at the bar.  Don't get me wrong...everyone was friendly, but the service was below what you would expect of a restaurant of this caliber, and with fairly high prices.  The food itself was good.  I had a Caesar salad, salmon and mashed potatoes.  Portions were adequate, but not overwhelming in size.  But it all tasted quite good and I felt I got my money's worth.  My \"go-to\" high caliber, high-price steakhouse in Charlotte continues to be Capital Grille.  Sullivan's could learn a lesson or two from them."}
{"text":"We went to Sullivan's June 18th for Father's Day and had a wonderful time.We had an 11:30 reservation in order to beat the crowd and it was well worth it. I'm sorry I don't have the waitress' name, but she was a blonde young lady who took perfect care of us, attending to our needs, but letting us enjoy our dinner in privacy too. We all used the Sure Thing menu and had the seafood bisque (the real deal with chunks of seafood you can see and taste), filet mignon, complete with mashed potatoes, Italian bread and creamy butter, and a choice of dessert ( cheese cake, key lime pie or banana pudding). All this for $44 a person. It was outstanding! Thank you Suliivans! And thank you to the new manager from Indianapolis who was on the job one day but still greeted all the customers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved Sullivans!  Drinks: Try their Pinot Noir that starts with an S, this Pinot had great body and I enjoyed a couple glasses. They have many options of wines, but this was the only one by the glass. Starter: I am a lover of Seared Rare Ahi Tuna but the spicy mustard sauce was too much. Other than that, the tuna was a good option. Salad: Split the wedge. It was very crisp, and the blue cheese was very flavorful! Entree: I loved the Filet Duxelle Mushroom Stuffed 8oz steak! Very delicious and I highly recommend! Side Dishes: Ask for the Loaded Baked Potato FULLY loaded! They put the white cheddar cheese sauce on it that they use in their Mac and Cheese. This was along with the normal loaded options. Delicious! The Steakhouse Skillet Mushrooms were great too! I'm clearly a fan of mushrooms... Dessert: Go for the seasonal Peanut Butter Black Bottom Pie! Don't even hesitate on this one if you like peanut butter. Presentation was beautiful and I loved the salted peanuts, caramel, and chocolate shavings that topped this amazing dessert! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I been here quite a few times.. Many gathering and birthday parties. This year, the girls and I decided it's best to ring the New Year with Sullivan's.. For this day. They have a set menu. Many choices you can pick from in each categories.. I have Evan as our waiter this time.. and per usual their customer service have alway been on point.. I'm not sure if the kitchen was slammed. But this time the steak is bit too tough and a little more done than I would like but any other times, I'm completely satisfied.. looking forward to many more celebrations at Sullivan's!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent as usual at Sullivan's. The filet medallions were great and the bone in ribeye excellent. The banana foster bread pudding was the perfect dessert. Alex our server was very attentive. The manager Stephanie went out of her way to make party feel at home."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My husband brought me here for my birthday and they gave me a rose and treated both of us really great.  He made reservations for us before the big dinner rush and after we sat down that's when it started getting crowded.  I've been wanting to come here for the longest and finally we came and we got:  The summer fling The New York strip 12oz, au gratin potatoes  2 waters Raspberry belini  Chocolate cake with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream  For a total of 150 Not too bad in my opinion  WE LOVED EVERYTHING! We're definitely coming back a lot more."}
{"text":"This is a good mid tier steakhouse in my opinion. I think it's a little more casual than BLT or Delfriscos. I do like the 3 course option and I think it's a reasonable price for what you get.y food has always been well prepared and the wait staff have been helpful friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentines dinner, and had a delightful dinner. Both of our steaks were perfection as well as our sides which included mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and a baked potato. The Pineapple Martini was an absolute knockout!!! You must try the bread pudding for dessert!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to say my last experience was not really that great.  We went for our anniversary back in October.  Our waiter was fantastic he deserves 4 stars, but the food was just ok, the wine list was very expensive, the environment was pleasant but it didn't have the feel of pride, hip and clean like it has in the past.  This was one of our favorite \"special treat\" places for years.  I'm sad that it wasn't great.  We may give it one more try just because it was so great before and everyone can have a bad night, but we're still on the fence on returning."}
{"text":"YUM! I know this place is a chain, but it was so friggin good.  Luckily my boss took me here ( hello open credit card), and it couldn't have been a better experience.  We had the seafood platter and calamari to start.  Both were excellent.  Now lets get to the bulk, the steaks. I had a 12 oz filet which was a great cut of meat.  I asked for medium and they cooked it perfectly.  The perfect amount of pink on the inside. My other coworker got the 22oz cowboy cut which was just absurd.  His skinny butt somehow finished the whole thing.  Beyond this, the service was outstanding.   Pros: everything you could want  Cons: A bit pricey, but hey you get what you pay for. Plates are about $35-$55."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and am a big fan. The food is always amazing and the service prompt. I have had the ribeye and fillet and they were both delicious. The sure thing menu is a great addition to the regular menu. This place is pretty expensive so I only go for special occasions."}
{"text":"I brought the ladies of the office here for lunch on International Women's Day this year. The staff was really great and accommodating. They let us do the sure thing pre fixe menu even though it was lunch time and not dinner. All of the food came out really well and very tasty including dessert. Everyone was really pleased with how things went and no one had any complaints about their food. I wouldn't say this is the best steakhouse I've every been to but honestly it is really good, their drink options are great, and the staff is amazing. You really can't go wrong by coming here."}
{"text":"For a year my husband and I ate at Sullivan's any Thursday we were in town, over 27 times according to my card. We really enjoy eating outside when the weather is nice...but we had to come early or the 'band' would set up and play. Oh my goodness...this guy makes my ears bleed. I cannot believe anyone wants to listen to that 'sound'.   And then April...oh my heavens...the WORST server on the planet. Seriously. We had a horrid experience after a positive prior experience, reported to the manager about it and from that point forward, she was a nightmare for us anytime she worked and we were there. We started doing dining room only because she made the time in the patio or bar so uncomfortable.   Natasha is an AMAZING server--always ask for her!  Mike and Mary are FABULOUS managers who rotate through the restaurant and make sure things are great...but oh that April...she's a pill and frankly, the reason we have not returned in 2016. Which saddens me because it's otherwise wonderful, but having the stink eye anytime she's there is a big negative for us.   The food---GREAT! Parking--okay, not a fan of valet services so self-parking = a little bit of a hike Dining room--wonderful ambiance Bar--great drink menu Desserts--PHENOMENAL"}
{"text":"Visited for restaurant week. My family and i all ordered the filet mignon with soup or salad with a side of mashed potatoes and chocolate mouse for dessert. We also ordered a side of sweet potato casserole. Our experience: the atmosphere was very nice and friendly even on a busy Wednesday night for restaurant week. No issues with service. Ceasar salad was good but did not care to much for the shrimp and lobster bisque. I did not like the color or care to much for the flavor. The soup was just okay but would not get it again. Our steaks were prepared and cooked to perfection! The mashed potatoes were prepared with a horse radish which none of us cared for. I finished mine but my wife and daughter did not. The big hit was the side of sweet potato casserole which pretty much could be considered a dessert because it was so sweet and delicious. Desert was chocolate mousse. We compared the mousse to Mortons downtown where we dined on Monday. Both Mortons and Sullivan's mousse were delicious but my wife and daughter preffered Sullivan's and I picked Mortons mousse as the winner. I thought Mortons was richer and had more flavor. We will definitely go back and reccomend Sullivan's."}
{"text":"I had the lobster and steak; it was amazing!!  I was traveling but this meal made my trip more enjoyable.  Would have had 5 stars but the sides, lowest cost per side was $3, were pretty bland at times. We had 9 people in our group and 1 out of the 5 sides we got was good. The others was just okay; but that's not okay bc each individual side is its own cost.  That being said, I will definitely go back. Although it wasn't ordered, the MacNCheese side I was told is amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent experience.  Went for our anniversary.  We were seated promptly to our table with rose petals on it.  We did mention it was our anniversary when making the reservation.  Our waitress, Diana, congratulated us and took our drink order.  Service was prompt and she was quick to answer our questions.  We had the filet and the rib eye.  Both were cooked a nice medium rare as requested.  At the end of the entrees, Diana, came over and let us know dessert was on them, so we're got the cheesecake to share.  It was yummy.  Then, Joe, the manager came over and congratulated us on our anniversary and thanked us for celebrating at Sullivan's.  All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Delicious and expensive place for an excellent steak dinner. Service is excellent. We did the Sunday special for $40 each that was a 3 course meal. Ended up being a better price since this place is a la carte like many nice steakhouses are. The service was absolutely wonderful and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is probably close to being, if not my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The decor sort of has that art deco, 1930's feel to it. I have dined here three or four times and also stopped in for dessert and a drink. Thursday night they usually have a jazz band. They also have a decent, very affordable bar/late night menu. For dinner I have had their steak, crab legs and sea bass which have all been excellent. We weren't able to get in anywhere around here (Lake Norman area) for restaurant week last year at the last minute so we made reservations for Sullivan's and drove right down. I also enjoyed their chocolate covered strawberries at the bar around Valentine's Day. As far as drinks go they make great martini's and have a decent wine selection."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last Thursday and I was excited to try Sullivan's because I've heard great things about it! It started off great. Our waiter was great (I want to say his name was Ken but I'm not positive). Anyway, I ordered the salmon plate (super yummy) and my husband ordered the steak that was on special that night. Everything was great until a waitress brought us our food. She asked my husband to cut open the steak to make sure it was cooked to his liking (medium rare). He cut it open and looked inside but the restaurant is SO dimly lit that he couldn't see. So he was pulling out his phone and telling her that he was going to turn the flashlight on to make sure it's cooked properly. She didn't wait for him to do that and instead bolted. Our waiter came by to check up on us as my husband was checking the steak with his phone flashlight and it was literally mooing. I mean, it was basically just seared on the outside and completely raw on the inside. Moooooooing. So our waiter took it away, they put it back on the grill to get it cooked through a bit more and returned with it a few minutes later. Ok so, three things: I ate my entire meal alone cause I'd rather not eat cold salmon by the time they returned with the cooked steak. Second: they just stuck his steak back on the grill. Not a new steak. For the prices we pay there, I expect a new steak. Third: the manager came back with the cooked steak and simply apologized for the mooing steak. I expected that we'd be comped in some way. Or a free dessert. Or just anything to make up for their terrible mistake. But no. Nothing. Nothing was done to truly correct their error. We didn't have any time to speak with anyone or fight anything cause by the time dinner was over, we had to be at a ballet in 15 minutes. It was a little disappointing that at a nice restaurant, they can't comp a meal when they made a big mistake and caused us to not even be able to eat our dinner together. That's a big deal to us because we NEVER get to go on dates (parents of two babies). And we only get to eat dinner together twice a week. So we'd like to eat together when we get to go on a raaaaare date. Anyway, needless to say, it was a disappointment. Food was good but the lack of action on their part was a little crappy. Not sure if we'll ever return."}
{"text":"As far as steakhouses go, I'd say this place is in the middle.  Service was great, but food was nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Last Friday was my first visit to a Sullivan's Steakhouse, and I have to admit I was impressed. I've frequented chain Steakhouses before; Morton's, Ruth Chris', Capital Grille, etc... and Sullivan's definitely ranks up there as one of my favorites (Capital Grille, not being one of them!).   Definitely start with the Crispy Shanghai Calamari and the Iceberg Lettuce Wedge Salad...both are amazing! The salad had a blue cheese dressing which I liked...and I do not generally like blue cheese! I had the Chili Crusted Ribeye...delicious. My fiance had the Pan Seared Sea Bass Hong Kong Style, which I liked, but she wasn't in love with. My in-laws went for the 3 course dinner for 2, and at $79, it was definitely a good deal!   A little on the pricey side, as Steakhouses can be, but a good meal with great service for the price tag.   PS: Order a Mojito...best I ever tasted."}
{"text":"I made reservations for 5:15 and got there at 5 with zero wait time...perfect! The waiter was very friendly...perfect! I ordered the Blue Crab Stuffed Shrimp ( from seasonal menu) perfect! My bf ordered 12 oz Filet Mignon...perfect! The dessert was Banana bread pudding with ice cream...awesome!! And I don't even like bread pudding !! This is a must have restaurant!"}
{"text":"1/13/2017 I took my daughter here to celebrate her 18th birthday. The experience was flawless. The food was amazing; all of it. The best part was the service, My server Cristhia was awesome, kind, thoughtful, and genuine.  Mary, Cristhia, Jessica, and the whole staff, thank you; I appreciate everything you did to make this day special for my daughter. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the knock out drink, love the lamb, love the cowboy if they cook it right, love the Grande Marnier Souffle the most.  What I don't like is the really poor service.  We have eaten here a dozen times and service is hit or miss.  Went in their twice and got rare cowboy steak when I asked for medium.  I know it's hard to cook, but...The second time it happened they brought it out three times. The first time it was raw with barely any marks, the second time it was medium rare, then they left it on till it was black and the manager came out with it and tried to convince me it was medium.  No apologies, no fresh steak, no free desert.  I did not eat it or send it back and no one cared.  At those prices I was fed up.  My husband an I tried to give it another shot recently after seeing a movie.  We went in to get drinks and a dessert.  The kitchen was closed a few minutes before we sat down.  We asked if we could get a cold desert, peice of bread, or a pretzel?  Nothing, just drinks.  After one with out food, we were done.  Sad to say Sullie's is comin' off the list.  :("}
{"text":"Atmosphere was really nice. Parking great! FOOD WAS AWESOME!!! Yes Sullivan's was pricy but for the great  food and great staff.. it was worth it! I had the Sea Bass, it melt in my mouth like cotton candy(THE BEST BASS I HAVE EVER HAD!!)  and my husband had cowboy rib eye(in which he said it was \"OK\". PLEASE NOTE: All meals are À la cart. Drinks was pricey, $12 for house wine. I WOULD GO BUT BACK! Great place 5 stars from me!!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER go there for Thursday Happy Hour again.  This used to be one of my favorite spots to meet up with friends.  From the staff that was difficult in working with a group of 10 to the rude patrons that keep coming up to us to get our table- total disappointment!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of chains but I had been wanting to go here for a while to try the steak.  The food is good but the service you get here is top notch. Great place to celebrate an event such as a birthday or promotion - just make sure someone else picks up the tab...wink wink."}
{"text":"The food was great. The adult beverage are awesome. The atmosphere was relaxing. The live music was fantastic."}
{"text":"Noms!  We sat at the bar, so I am not sure of the atmosphere in the restaurant, but the atmosphere in the bar was fairly mellow.  I had an 8oz fillet  Mignon and a wedge salad.  The salad was drowned in dressing, but that can be prevented in the future by ordering it on the side.  The only negative thing I have to say about the steak is that they wanted me to order all kinds of crap to put on top of it.  A good, proper steak only needs to be served with a side of au jus!  The meat was properly cooked, and I ate the whole thing.  On Sunday nights, the drink menu is half price, so I had 2 froofy martinis.  They were pretty good too.  Our server was very nice as well, and did her job well.  This place is also fairly gluten-free friendly, but as with any place, you have to remind the staff over and over that no, you can't have the bread and butter that they placed in front of you, and that is a bit irritating."}
{"text":"Get to the Chase:  Pros: 1) Some dishes were amazing like the sea bass and bok choy with a soy glaze 2) Service is top notch 3) Very large room with plenty of space  Cons: 1) What pretends to be a swanky and posh restaurant, fails to deliver in the same level of quality in its food (ahi tuna was limp and mushy, had 3 different meat dishes but all tasted the same and were over-seasoned) 2) The restaurant is a clash between casual and dress-up...leaving you feeling a bit underwhelmed in a stuffy environment 3) Hosts at the reception lack the attention to detail and are too pre-occupied with whatever they're doing to notice when people walking into cloak rooms with the intention of the bathroom 4) Definitely expensive....$350 meal with 4 entrees, 2 appetizers, 1 dessert and a bottle of wine split between 4 people  Overall, a hit or miss. Great potential, some winning dishes, but overall not worth the money they demand."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We went here for Valentine's Day dinner and had the prix frixe menu. They had a great selection!! We started with cocktails. I got the martini with blue cheese olives and my boyfriend got the sweet chocolatey specialty cocktail. They were great! I did order some more olive juice for my martini because I like them extra dirty. We then got the Caesar salad and shrimp and lobster bisque. The soup was incredible. For our entrees we got the lobster and filet that came with 2 sides. We got the garlic mashed potatoes and the lobster Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was okay but the steak and lobster was incredible. So were the appetizers. For dessert we got the chocolate mousse and the cheesecake. The chocolate mousse was very rich and good. All in all a great experience. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the timing. We did have to wait about 30 minutes or so past when our reservation time was but it wasn't too bad. I just wish they would have been a little more clear about the timing. We got a text 15 mins after our reservation time saying that our table was ready and then when we told the hostess we didn't get seated until about 15 or so minutes after that so we aren't sure if they had forgotten about us or not. But turns out they hadn't forgotten and we got seated and all in all it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service was great! The wine list will have something for everyone. If you need a suggestion try the Sequoia Grove Cabernet - it's pricey, but worth every penny. Excellent atmosphere for a variety of occasions. If you're not feeling like having a steak, try the Salmon - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Perfect for: First Date A night out with spouse Nigh out for just drinks (specials are AWESOME)-sit at the bar A swanky place to pre-game"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best for the price.  My steak was not cooked properly and the side dishes were boring ."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. I had ordered Medium Rare Ribeye. It was $44.00 and was cooked to medium. And was very very Salty.  I was offered another steak at no charge. It's a steak house, you have to get it right the first time. And I was not visited by the manager after complaining. Poor Customer Service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine in south Charlotte. The ambiance/ lighting is sexy in the bar area which is where I prefer to eat. The wait/ bar staff are positive & knowledgable. They always have my favorite champagne too Great place to go for a date night"}
{"text":"I have to admit I only like this place on Wed. & Thurs. for their happy hour specials. I can get some great martinis for half price while having a cheap nosh too. The jazz music is always wonderful to relax out to (bit louder inside than out on the patio).  My one small complaint is the uniforms for the women are just awful! Being an upscale steakhouse one should not have women or any shape or size wearing short mini skirts with whatever black hose/fishnets/leggings/etc that they want. It makes this place go a bit down in class for me .  Had din din here one or two times...not bad, but not the best either. Would choose quite a few other steakhouses to have an elegant din.   All in all like I said the happy hour is well worth it!"}
{"text":"My coworker suggested I check out the happy hour specials here and I was not disappointed. I ordered the cheesesteak eggs rolls, Sriracha shrimp and a blueberry lemon drop martini. Everything was flavorful and felt like a party in my mouth. I loved it!! To top it there was live music on the patio. The energy and vibe here was perfect. I'll will definitely be back for me!"}
{"text":"Not s fan!!!!   Steak was covered in pepper and just wasn't very good considering the $42 price tag!   Sides are extra as well. Not impressed think I'll stick with beef and bottle!"}
{"text":"Props to a Solid Steak House....  Sullivans has a very dark and swank atmosphere giving off a very upscale vibe. This is a personal favorite will living in Charlotte. It was my first experience with the lettuce wedge with diced tomatoes, blue cheese dressing, and crushed black pepper - just plain awesome. Their are known for their steaks which are tremendous. Big fan of the key lime pie for dessert. The wait staff is attentive and personal. If you are visiting/living in Charlotte give it a try, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was awful. Took approximately 23 minutes just to close the tab. We were initially given the wrong meal, had to order drinks multiple times, and never received any check ins from the waitress. Additionally, when we ordered a glass of water while closing out our tab, we were told the restaurant had run out of everything, including water."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. My daughter took us to Sullivan's Steakhouse. This was the second visit for me and my husband. The atmosphere is great, the food was delicious and the waitstaff attentive. We had an 8 oz. steak, potatoes, onion straws, wedge salad (daughter had Caesar salad) and dessert. My daughter had a 12 oz. steak. Complimentary bread is served before your appetizer arrives. Since we ordered our steaks well done I appreciated that our server asked us to cut into it to make sure it was done to our satisfaction. Mine was a little red on the inside so she took it back and returned a few minutes later with a perfectly done steak. It's the little things, you know?  They had a special, $39 per person, which is wonderful. But you have to ask for the special since it's not advertised. I think the price is reasonable for all you get, which was filling and delicious. I left there a happy camper. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"We visited Sullivan's for dinner Saturday night and decided to start with a drink at the bar.  At 6:30 p.m., we were the only people in there... except for the jazz trio.  Now, I like jazz as much as the next person, but the bar at Sullivan's is fairly small and compact, and the music was pretty loud.  It was good but seemed a little unnecessary.  Our drinks (a dirty martini and a Cosmopolitan) were good, but not great, and were $26 together.  Onto dinner!  Our waiter greeted us and kept mentioning how he'd heard how much we liked Shiraz.  Huh?  He said he'd even send over the sommelier to help us pick a good bottle.  Again, huh?  I finally had to tell him that I thought they'd mixed us up with other people because we had cocktails at the bar.  He showed me his notes from our visit three years ago (tracked through OpenTable?) when we bought a bottle of Shiraz.  Ha!  I appreciate the attention to detail, but it seemed like a little bit of overkill, especially since it'd been three years, and there isn't really an alcohol we don't like.    The fella decided to go with the $39, 3-course menu and got the shrimp cocktail, lettuce wedge and steak.  The shrimp cocktail was fine (it's really hard to mess that up) and there were fewer shrimp than with the full-price appetizer; the lettuce wedge was okay but would've been even better with bacon; and the steak.... well, for Sullivan's being a steakhouse, it was pretty bland.  It almost tasted like bologna to me.  Yikes.  On a better note, I opted for the cheesesteak egg roll appetizer, which was delicious, and the chicken piccata entree, which was tender, moist, and seasoned perfectly.  We each got a glass of wine - not Shiraz! - and our waiter had some good suggestions on those.  I really wanted to have a great experience at Sullivan's, but for the price, there are much better steakhouses in Charlotte.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Since this is a Steakhouse expect it to be pricey.  Wine is expensive in all restaurants by the bottle so bring your own and pay the 25 dollar corking fee. Before they recently changed the menu the Salad use to come with the steak but that is not the case any more. The Sides are good for groups so share some. Sides to try is Mac and cheese with bread crumbs on top , Creamed corn, Garlic Mashed. I usually get the Filet or the Chicken even though it's a steak house. It's very tasty. The Chocolate moose is good but it's seasonal dessert. If you aren't up to spending the money try the Pre fix menu or wait for Restaurant week since they have great dishes to try for a great price."}
{"text":"BF and I wanted our last dinner in Charlotte to be a nice one so we came to Sullivan's on a coworkers recommendation.  I made reservations via Open Table on Yelp about 2 hours before we went to dinner.  Free valet service upon arrival (with tip, of course) which was kinda weird because some valet cars were parked right in front.   The place was almost full when we walked in.  Seemed like good business on a Thursday night.  The atmosphere and decor made it seem like an up-scale casual restaurant.  Service was on point for the whole night.  When I asked a worker where the restroom was, he actually walked me there across the restaurant instead of pointing or giving directions.  For appetizer, we started with raw oysters which were decently alright.  For entree, one of the specials for the night was a filet mignon trio dish in which the filets are prepared with 3 different toppings/sauces.  My bf ordered the rib-eye, medium rare.  My filets were pretty yummy, but my BF was disappointed with his rib-eye.  It was overcooked and the rib-eye that they serve here is not dry-aged.  He only ate half of his steak unfortunately.  Overall dinner was OK, but nothing too memorable.  We'll likely try another steakhouse in Charlotte next time I'm back in town for business."}
{"text":"Sullivan's is a favorite of my boyfriend and me. Of course, we thought it would be most befitting to have family and friends join us for his college graduation celebration dinner at our beloved Sullivan's.  We (party of 6) sat in the outside bar/patio area. Our server Marissa greeted us and introduced herself. Orders were placed, etc... the appetizers FINALLY arrived, however we did not receive any eating utensils. Upon request a few were provided, but not enough to accommodate all at the table. One of our guests had to go and ask for their own utensils, which never arrived, the table just shared what we were provided.  After over an hour wait, we inquired about the entrees, in which a different waitress was sent over, to advise us that Marissa was new, and this was not the initial incident of customers complaining, meanwhile, we consistently saw Marissa pass our table, and delightfully served the surrounding tables. We also noticed the manager speak with an adjacent table, however he failed to address our concerns, only the replacement waitress. After over an hour wait, our entrees arrived. Those of us that ordered the sure thing menu option, did not receive our soup/salads, and some entrees were incorrect all together. Sullivan's was a total disappointment and embarrassment to my boyfriend and I, as we had raved about the restaurant, and it was HIS celebratory moment that was ruined. We have frequented this location and well as the Raleigh, NC location (we' meet former Charlotte Manager, Aileen, who is currently the Raleigh, NC manager) on many occasions, and have never had to succumb to this level of poor and disappointing customer service.  Our party left dissatisfied and without most of their meals (salad, desserts)."}
{"text":"Came here the other night on an extension of my best friend and I's indulgent outings.  We stopped in here after Nan and Byrons for martinis and an appetizer.  Completely blown away by the dirty martinis we had as well as the steak flatbread and bleu cheese wedge we shared. Everything was amazing! Its been a few days and I cannot stop thinking about that wedge salad. Great now I have to call her and go and do this all over again..... Yes this has to happen now........ The food was outstanding and I can only imagine what their steaks and entrees are like. I will have to also return with my guy soon so he can try.... and all my other friends until I run out of friends and I have to find new excuses to come as often as I want. We came on a Thursday and it was unexpectedly relaxed which main be the norm but it was my first time and for some reason I thought it was going to be a bit more fancy and stuffy but alas they had a live band and a good crowd and everyone seemed to be having a great time! The service was outstanding we sat at the bar as always.  I love the fact that they have a bar bites menu for a sort of happy hour. Definitely recommend this place for any occasion and I cannot wait to go (like in the next hour for sure since now I cant stop thinking about it)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night everything was excellent One thing when I called to reserve a table I asked about the Sunday special price supper and was told they no longer had that Much to my surprise when I received the menu from our waiter it also hav a special 3 course menu for a price of $44.00 each with a nice choice of items We chose that menu and everything was Excellent  The people that answer the phone should know this Not knowing may keep some customers from coming into this restaurant"}
{"text":"It was as advertised. It was a great choice  for  restaurant  week. Everything was grade A. Our server Chris was awesome and very knowlegeable  about the menu. I would highly recommend  this  place."}
{"text":"This place was superb in all respects: food, presentation, service, ambiance.  It really left nothing to be desired in a five-star steakhouse experience.  And the fact that the Chicago Bears picked up the tab made it all the sweeter. ;)  Our party of eight ordered the oysters Rockefeller, seared ahi tuna tartare, fried calamari, and seafood sampler appetizers.  I tried all but the last, and all were adequate-to-amazing.  The oysters Rockefeller were goeey-cheesy, spinachy and warm, with just the slightest tinge of salty oyster flavor beneath.  The ahi tuna tartare was fresh, perfectly seared and presented beautifully.  Even the standard calamari was above-average: warm and soft, not rubbery in the slightest.  My wedge salad with diced roma tomatoes, fresh-ground black pepper and creamy bleu cheese dressing was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  The lobster bisque, presented with a zig-zag of cream down the middle, was a tad salty for my tastes.  But it did boast more than the usual amount of lobster chunks.  I've had better, but this was still good.  For my entree, I enjoyed the 12-ounce filet mignon with gorgonzola butter melted over it.  My date had the jumbo scallops with spicy Thai sauce.  Both were dazzling.  My steak was lean, immensely flavorful and perfectly prepared (warm and pink throughout, with no raw parts in the middle).  Our party ordered family-style sides: creamed spinach, asparagus with Hollandaise, horseradish mashed potatoes and au gratin potatoes.  I didn't try the spinach, but the rest were terrific.  And plentiful: nobody was left wanting for any of them.  For dessert, I enjoyed the bananas Foster bread pudding.  I'm normally not a bread pudding kinda guy, but it stood out on the dessert menu, so I gave it a shot.  I was not disappointed: hot, smooth, firm, with the perfect amount of banana, real whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream.  The cappucino served with dessert was lukewarm, but the service staff came around and topped it off with fresh hot coffee.  Speaking of the service staff, they could not have been more attentive to all of the various mundane tasks that often get overlooked: refilling water glasses, whisking away finished plates, scooping up crumbs with those nifty crumb-scooper-upper thingies.  Our server's knowledge of the menu and specials was thorough, and he was beyond helpful and attentive.  I don't anticipate being in Charlotte again, but if I ever am, I will flock back to Sullivan's.  Please give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very good overall.  We had the filet and the chicken.  Lobster bisque and kale/pecan salad are recommended."}
{"text":"My little brother had just turned 21, and as a Marine he didn't often get to enjoy delicious food so I wanted to treat him to a great steakhouse. After reading lots of Yelp reviews, I had decided on Sullivan's Steakhouse.  To reduce the wait, I originally made a reservation earlier in the week for 730, but when I tried to change it online it said that my reservation wasn't found. When I called, they acted like I wanted a new reservation, so to move on I just created a new one for 8 pm. We had a couple beers at Sycamore earlier in the night, so we walked over to Sullivan's and got there right at 8 pm. We were really hungry, but were told that they were running behind and it should only be about 15/20 minutes, we weren't pleased, but it was a nice night so we waited outside. At about 8:25, I went inside to check in again and they said that they were still waiting on tables.... then at 8:50, we were finally seated. I understand that sometimes the tables are running behind, but I definitely did not make a reservation to be seated almost an hour later. It would be great if they would have texted us that they were running late so that we could have stayed at Sycamore.   To counter this, the service from our waiter was spectacular. We got a free appetizer for our wait (no I didn't ask) and when we ordered the crab cakes the waiter gave us advice that with out 4 people, it might make more sense to get another appetizer. We definitely appreciated that advice!  We ordered 2 bottles of wine along with dinner, and ordered steaks along with some sides served tableside. I got the filet mignon, and it was perfectly cooked, buttery and melt in your mouth. I also got the Cajun butter, which is butter that has Cajun spices that you can put on your steak (which then melts.) I liked how they didn't automatically add it so you were able to control how much butter is on your steak. We got the mushrooms, asparagus, king crab gnocchi and garlic horseradish mashed potatoes. My favorite was definitely the king crab gnocchi- spicy and creamy, with chunks of jalapeños.  You probably only need about a side per person maximum, as they are large in conjunction with the steak. We were pretty full, but the waiter approached us and said that we could get any desert, on the house to celebrate my brother's birthday. I know that he was really excited and they even added a Happy Birthday message! He got the Peanut Butter Pie, and it was rich, fluffy, with thinly sliced chocolate pieces on top and a chocolate black bottom.  We spent about $400 for 4 people, including 2 bottles of wine. We did get the appetizer and a desert for free, but overall I think it is expensive but reasonably priced based on the quality of the food and the service. I was disappointed with how they handled the reservation, but everything other than that was incredible."}
{"text":"Myself, along with my wife, aunt, cousin, stepdad and mom went here to celebrate my moms 60th birthday. This was her favorite place and where she wanted to go.   All of us had a range of experiences and overall, even with inconsistencies, we were very well taken care of. The manager made sure that anything that was wrong was corrected. My stepdad's steak was almost raw and he asked for medium. My moms asparagus was cold. My aunts hamburger had way too much pepper.   That said, my meal was cooked perfectly and it was very good. My wife and cousins meals were also perfect. I had the King crab legs and an order of Mac n cheese. Both were delicious. If the orders were consistent, which I would expect for this type of restaurant, it would easily be a 5 star. The only reason I'm giving 4 is due to the manager stepping in and making it all right."}
{"text":"Great high quality steak house. I like the shrimp cocktail, large shrimp, with spicy sauce. The filet and lobster include a lettuce wedge and blue cheese. Yes, I know Sullivan's is a chain. The quality is high and consistent."}
{"text":"I've been several times.  New Year's Eve 2013 most recent.  Bar can't make skinny margarita.  Oh well.  Steak was good but over salted.  Mushrooms over salted a lot but I liked them anyway.  The rest was great.  Chocolate covered strawberries were soooo good.   Surprised to see a visible layer of dust on wood rail next to our booth.  Not good.  Please clean well!!!  I'd go  back."}
{"text":"I would probably give Sullivan's a better rating if they weren't pulling a bait-and-switch for Restaurant Week. The hostess \"forgot\" to give us (and all the tables around us) the Restaurant Week menu and the waiter tried to get us to switch to their Summer menu - which is of course more expensive (and I don't mean he just suggested it, it was a hard sell). I seriously don't appreciate that - we were only trying the place BECAUSE it was Restaurant Week! Come on!  I did enjoy the food - once we got them to hand over the special menu. I was hoping their meat would be Del Frisco's quality since they are owned by them, but not quite. Would I go again? Maybe. The bar was cool and they had a good bar menu.   Please make sure you specifically ask for the Restaurant Week menu so you get the deal you came for! I really hope this isn't a new trend for restaurants during Restaurant Week, it's so tacky!"}
{"text":"It was Charlotte Restaurant Week, so it still took us 20 minutes to be seated with a reservation... The hostess was pleasant, so it didn't put me in a bad mood... Our server was funny, attentive and knowledgeable... I love the wine list because you can order by bin number and not have to stumble your way through an order... (I can recognize a brand and a label but I am horrible at pronouncing some of the names... lol) The Caesar salad had just the right amount of dressing... I don't normally eat shrimp, but the ones that came with this NY strip steak were phenomenal... The steak itself was also very well prepared... I ordered it medium well and that is exactly how it came to the table... Just the slightest bit of pink and a nice texture... The mashed potatoes were pretty good and the vegetables were just basic... Luckily my boyf doesn't eat desserts, so I always get to try at least two for CRW... Last night's options were a Bananas Foster bread pudding and a chocolate mousse... I couldn't really get down with the bread pudding, but my friend seemed to love it... The mousse was a great way to end the meal, though!"}
{"text":"We live very close to Sullivan's and have eaten there on numerous occasions. Some have been amazing and some not so great. In the past few years' we've made it a tradition to visit on Christmas Eve to 'treat' ourselves to a night out before the busyness of the next day rolls around.  This year we were happy to see they were not very busy even tho we were told on the phone they wouldn't be able to serve us. It's always me, my significant other and a single friend with whom we share our holiday eve with. We sat in the bar; the service was phenomenal. We thought the bill was pricey even with a $25 gift card, but we were cool with it.   We all shared the Calamari which was wonderful. My SO and I shared the filet/lobster tail entree, both of which were not very tasty. The lobster tail was so bland and came without butter. Our friend enjoyed his ribeye. We shared two vegetable sides, mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes. The shrooms were average and the mashed potatoes were flavorless.  Coming away, we feel as if the quality/flavor of the food has really declined since our last visit and I felt a need to leave this message here.  We love our neighborhood spot and our holiday tradition, but not sure if we'll change it up next year or not."}
{"text":"This was better than I expected- it is New Years Eve and they are offering a fixed menu but none of us know what it's going to cost so we call the waitress over to ask- how much is it? $69 before 6 and 79 after. We get there before 6 but the bill still comes for the higher amount even though the check says we ordered at 5:47. Good was very good for sure and service was ok- she was a little distant as a waitress . The busboy was setting a table near us and knocked into my husbands chair a few times but never apologized . Some tables had New Years Party hats and others didn't- what's that about? Will return for good food just need to iron out a few things."}
{"text":"I give the restaurant a 3 based on what I would expect for cuisine and service for the prices on the menu.  Ate at the bar. Staff didn't seem to eager to get me a beverage or pay attention to me.  Steak was \"ok.\"  Side of Broccoli was warm at best- was soon cold.  I just didn't feel the wow for the price."}
{"text":"I really expected to write a 4 star review for this place.  Let me begin by saying we decided to eat dinner here on a Thursday night.  We thought to ourselves, \"oh it won't be crowded\".  Wrong.  It was packed!  I had the bone in KC steak and it was stupendous!  Couldn't get a better cooked steak if I tried!  Where the rating starts to fall is the feeling of the place.  While the bar area seemed nice and warm and cozy.  The dining area with it's low booths and open area seating takes away from the experience in my opinion.  I want a little seclusion some times.  But all in all this place is a solid dinner choice."}
{"text":"We took my step daughter there for her 13th birthday as we wanted to take her somewhere nice and she wanted steak but we didn't want to drop a \"Del Friscos\" amount of money...the over all ambiance was nothing great , way too brightly lit for an evening dinner and the fact you have no choice but to valet park and They park your car right outside the door is a little much but I understand uptown parking can be an issue so no big deal there . Our server was nice, my finance's steak was more rare than medium so we did have to send that back and when I ordered my 2nd glass of wine the server came over and poured what was left of my old glass Into my fresh glass, which is a huge etiquette \"no,no\" especially at $15 a glass...  It was a nice treat and we like to try someone new every time we go out but I doubt we will going there again."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Sullivan's on Saturday, July 22nd to celebrate my sisters birthday. As soon as we walked into the establishment I was impressed by how attentive the staff was. Our reservation was on time and we were seated right away. Upon being seated we were greeted by our server, Bradley. Bradley was outstanding. He was attentive without being over the top, and personable. Bradley even went so far as to get me a side of the seasoning that was used on my steak to take home. The entire meal was outstanding. All steaks at our table were cooked perfectly. My mother is a vegetarian who hates fish, she ordered the salmon Rockefeller and was beyond satisfied. The next time I am in Charlotte, I will be going to Sullivan's. Hopefully Bradley is our server again."}
{"text":"I attended a dinner of 50 guys last week held on the patio. It's a tight fit out there but these folks really did a great job. While the dinner food was prepaid, drinks were on your own. These gals didn't miss a beat. Many of us ate steaks & while the strips needed a steak knife, they were prepared as ordered. That's not an easy task for such a large group."}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse. Highly recommend the lobster bisque... very creamy. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly - nice and pink on the inside. For dessert, I highly recommend the bread pudding. The cheesecake is average.   As for service - we were seated right away which doesn't always happy at restaurants on a Saturday night even with reservations. Our waiter was very attentive though towards the end I felt a little rushed out.   My only critique would be a better beer selection. They only had a small number on tap."}
{"text":"Fine dining without the snobbery, Sullivan's in Charlotte is an excellent place to get some surf and turf. Great wait staff too. Took a bachelor party to eat there and when the food came out there were 6 very quiet guys chowing down on a great meal.  Funny rumor; beware of cougars at the bar."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4 or 5 times when in town. The food and service are always very good and I have never had a bad meal here. The steak is always cooked perfectly and has good flavor. The mac and cheese and various vegetable sides are always good. The potatoes can be salty at times but still decent.  The atmosphere is pretty good although the dining room is a bit crowded at times. The service has been attentive and pleasant each time without having the kind of snobbishness you sometimes encounter at a good steakhouse. They have been genuinely fun and helpful every time.  I have had better steaks but Sullivan's has been consistently very good and I would recommend it to anyone looking for steak in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We always go to Sullivan's for most of our special occasions! Love this place! Can't say enough about the food or service!"}
{"text":"Our reserved table was ready when we arrived. Seated immediately, server approached us with a big welcome, ice water poured within 3 minutes. Drinks/bread/entrees all served quickly. Both of our steaks were a bit overcooked. Our server Lynn, as well as the manager offered us new filets but we declined because they were still delicious. Received a free dessert to make up for the filets. Excellent customer service, delicious food. Beautiful ambiance. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"During a quick trip to Charlotte, we stopped in at Sullvian's in between apartment tours. Conveniently located in Charlotte's South End neighborhood, Sullivan's appears to be a great spot to grab lunch, dinner, or a drink. We arrived on a Tuesday just before they officially opened for lunch (11:30). To my surprise, aside from us there was only one other party waiting to be seated. And, throughout our short 30 minute stay I didn't see anyone else come in the door. We weren't really hungry for lunch, but we each ordered a bloody Mary. I think we were both in the mood for a drink with a homemade mix, but they use the premixed commercial stuff that you can find in just about any food store. The drinks were a bit on the weaker side, so we then transitioned over to wine (which, btw, we should have ordered in the first place). We didn't order any food as we ended up dining at the 7th Street Market later in the day.  Lastly, one of the highlights of our time at Sullivan's was the extremely friendly and outgoing bartender who, just happened to also be from Pittsburgh. We enjoyed talking with her and hearing about her experiences in Charlotte.  If we move into the area, we'd likely give Sullivan's another go."}
{"text":"Let me get to the point. This steak house is ok. We have other steak houses in Charlotte. Chris, Morton, Capitol,  Frisco, Palm and Outback. If you're searching for a good steak?"}
{"text":"Good food, drinks and atmosphere. The Knock out pineapple martinis are amazing as well as their wedge and the scallops. The happy hour is great for afterwork get togethers. And don't miss out on sitting on the patio when its a nice night out."}
{"text":"Always good! We had a large party and our server was great! The food was fabulous as usual! If you want a good steak this is the place to get it! Definitely in my b top 5. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere! Three things I look for when I am heading out for dinner. April is the waitress to ask for. She works in the bar area and will make sure you dining experience is second to none."}
{"text":"I recently dined at Sullivan's with my boyfriend and it was a memorable experience to say the least. This is now one of my favorite steakhouses to eat in Charlotte. If you want a great dining experience with outstanding service and amazing food, this is the place to go. The price point is certainly not for conservative spenders, however for those that search for an overall experience rather than savings, will be rewarded with great service and delectable food. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I think I reviewed this already but....  You expect a great steak with great service to be a bit  expensive.  You get what you pay for.   There were 8 of us and we had reservations..  The service was great.  The food was great and the wine list was a book of great wines available at all prices.  I will be back to try their dry-aged bone-in rib eye.  All of us that the whole evening was wonderful."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. Ate there last friday. Waitress had no clue about menu. Could not ring drinks in properly. Food was okay but service was below mediocre"}
{"text":"Service reigns supreme to me.  Then, flavor is a close part B.   Today's call in then pick up was anything BUT flawless. I canceled Del Frisco's reservations so I could just pick up Sullivan's on the way home. Didn't feel like driving to South Park.   Anywhooz, today I learned Sullivan's is part of Del Frisco's corporate umbrella. Cool. I've had prior visits and didn't collect points but I will today.   Ordered the Sure Thing which is their 3 course price fixe. Arrived to no parking. Valet said just take handicap. So I feel uncomfortable and rushed.  I don't want to inconvenience any handicap placard or disabled person. I know the struggles.   Enter: no hostess.  I walk to bar. They redirect me to hostess stand.  I wait. She's sweet.  Gets ticket and it's double the cost. Someone didn't catch I asked for the \"Sure Thing.\"   This took several attempts to fix including a manager saying it doesn't exist. Another Manger says it does and boom... the head Mgr fixes everything then exceeded my expectations with a bonus card for an official apology.   I was standing in the restaurant writing this 3 star review when it jumped to 5 because of how everyone took some extra initiative to WOW! the customer.   I didn't get the steak I ordered yet valet and mgmt were on par.  Why 3?  * I called back to inform someone that they didn't check us in for OpenTable. *I was told it was handled. I'm sure it was just some server passing by and answered the phone.  *minutes later I get the no show email from Open Table.  * There's room for improvement and I'm sure they'll make it. This won't deter me. Just taught me to dine in, always."}
{"text":"My husband and I like to try higher end steakhouses, especially for special occasions.  I had not tried this restaurant before. So he made a reservation for my birthday. I think they have a good menu and the food was very good, I got the bone in ribeye and he got the salmon. Both were well prepared. As an appetizer we did the calamari which was quite good.  That is why I am giving them 3 stars.  My issue is that the service was LACKING for what one would expect at a higher end restaurant. We knew we were going to have an issue the minute we were sat across from a party of 16 celebrating a 50 th birthday. It was a week night, the restaurant was not crowded but for some reason they sat a large party near the front along with several other parties bunched up around  that table, including ours. IMHO they should have seated a party that large away from others. The party was fairly tame but there were times when we could not hear each other because as with any group there is going to be a lot of conversation, and some will be louder than others. I fault management for seating several parties so close together around a large group while other tables near the back sat empty. Doesn't make sense and doesn't enhance the dining experience.  Our waitress was one of the people attending that table. Every time, regardless of whether the restaurant is high end or low end, when we have had a server attending a large party, we have felt shortchanged on service and that was the case here. Our service was delayed the entire meal- from removal of dishes, filling of water glasses,  serving of food. When we asked the server about the table, she flippantly stated oh it was just a group celebrating a 50 the birthday not 20 somethings, so it should not get out of hand. I thought that was an odd comment to make, and somewhat offensive. I am not sure why she had to go there. IMHO her answer should have been, don't worry I'll take good care of you or offered to move us.   My husband had advised that we were celebrating my birthday so she offered a free dessert from the menu- we did the warm chocolate cake which was good. He had planned to order coffee, but she left before he could even do so. Usually coffee is offered. She did not offer it. It felt like she was trying to wrap up us and get us out of there.  We paid the bill and when she returned his credit card, she thanked him by his first name!!  We felt that was unprofessional. Throughout the meal she had a very cavalier, casual attitude with us that I just didn't appreciate.  We chose not to make a scene in the dining area, but when we got to the hostess stand on the way out, we asked to speak to manager. A young manager came out to talk to us, apologized and offered his card with a promise of free drinks and appetizers at a future visit. I would try another steakhouse before coming back here. Restaurants need to remember that you only get one chance to make a first impression."}
{"text":"The filet mignon steak was cooked perfectly! Crime brûlée was delicious. Definitely worth the money"}
{"text":"We took the extended family to Sullivan's (party of 8). I had the salmon which was very good. Daughter had sea bass which she liked and the rest of the crew had steaks and chicken and all were pleased with their food. Appetizers were some type of cheesesteak egg roll or something and everyone loved that. I thought the Calamari was very good as well. Service was good and prompt and they had 2 servers assigned to our table which was great. Our lead server was ok and that's the only knock. He was competent just seemed so scripted and rehearsed it didn't sit well with everyone. So would we return yes. Would we hope to get a different server, yes."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a fancy night out, celebrating a special event, or looking for an upscale place to have cocktails with coworkers, Sullivan's Steakhouse is the place for you. I came on a Wednesday around 6PM and the place was already packed! They have complimentary Valet parking that work off of just tips which eases the pain of trying to find parking in this busy spot. Luckily we were seated right away by the very welcoming hostesses who actually made you feel like they wanted you to have a great experience - which is a rarity.   Come here on a Wednesday. Drinks that are normally $11-$14 are discounted at $7 which is great way to save a few bucks and still feel fancy. Confirm with hostesses on the timing for that happy hour, it may be from only 5PM-630PM.   I ordered the Filet stuffed with Mushrooms and it was like butter. The mash potatoes and mac and cheese sides were worthy of licking off the plate. I certainly left feeling satisfied on a full belly of delicious dirty martinis (with blue cheese stuffed olives -- yum!) steak, and sides. Highly recommend for a fine dining experience!"}
{"text":"I really want to give Sullivan's 4 stars but in comparing this experience to a recent visit to Longhorn, I just can't bring myself to do it.  Went here with a group from work for an \"appreciation dinner\"  Normally, Appreciation dinners end up at Chili's or Ruby Tuesday so I was completely shocked we ended up here.  Everything was great service wise.  Foodwise, it was good but I'd expect that from a place like this.  I ordered one of their Mixup lunches which gives you a salad option, a protein and a side.  I ordered the mixed green salad, the porcini mushroom and pepper encrusted strip and an order of carmelized cauliflower as a side.  The strip was amazing.  It came sliced over a layer of steak sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.  The salad was ok....mixed greens with tomatoes, blue cheese and a dressing that I still do not recognize.  The cauliflower came in a mound.  Honestly, this had to be 1/2 to 2/3 of the head of cauliflower.  It was seasoned with capers and other herbs.  While the taste was good, the quantity was entirely too much and I could only eat half.  The decor of the place is as you would expect with a lot of medium to dark wood but it just didn't do anything for me.  Same with the service. While they were all friendly, our water just didn't go beyond what he was expect to do.     Sorry, Sullivans but I can get better service at Longhorn and frankly I think their food is better also.   But still this is a solid or 3 1/2 star review."}
{"text":"Was here for the recent #wwlp2014 and it's the first time I have been here.  The bar area is nice and gets fairly packed!  There are tables tucked around the corners, which give you some intimacy if you can snag one.  It's hard to order a drink if you aren't sitting directly at the bar.  They should have a server come around and take orders when there are a lot of people standing in the bar area.  (can you say lost revenue?)  The event was in a private room in the back, which has another patio-type room at the other end, so longer and narrow.  They packed in an amazing amount of pretty people, music and fun for the evening.  They were serving a Knockout Cocktail, which was pineapple and delicious.  Apps were a big hit... cheesesteak egg rolls (oh, so good), bruschetta and shrimp cocktail.    The staff were a bit overwhelmed by the crowd, but stayed very focused and handled everyone pleasantly.  I would say one minus is when you come blasting out of this high-energy event you are tromping right through the middle of the dining room... I felt bad for the diners who were startled by the sudden interruption of their quiet meals. oops.  Overall, with the staff and the quality of refreshments, I'd try Sullivan's again, but this time for dinner!"}
{"text":"Love it here Thursday nights,  Live band,  nice atmosphere,  and the blueberry lemon drop Martini is the best."}
{"text":"I used to go to Sullivan's several years ago when Southend was just getting going. I wanted to take my son out for a special dinner last Friday to celebrate his new summer internship. Thought it would be good to try Sullivan's again as it is pretty close to my home in Dilworth. Made the reservation on-line which was by far the best part of the experience. It went downhill from there.  First, I was annoyed they called me to make sure I would honor my reservation. What am I supposed to do, drop everything and give them a call to let them know I would be there?  Second, the place smelled like a urinal cake.  I felt like I was dining in a porta-potty. Third, the hostess felt my son and I should dine in the back private room rather than the main dining room. We were dressed appropriately and the place was not crowded. We did complain and they moved us to the main dining room. Fourth, the staff rushed us through the meal and they were flat out rude. The food was okay, but not distinguishable from other top steak houses. Wine list was overpriced compared to Bonterra Wine Room for same bottle of red. For the price, folks are better off at The Capital Grill, Flemmings, Beef'n Bottle, Ruth's Chris, or The Palm depending on your location."}
{"text":"The food at Sullivan's is amazing and probably the only reason I have this place two stars instead of one. My family decided to have thanksgiving dinner here along with two family friends. We had a dinner reservation at 6:15. We arrived promptly at 6:10 and used to complimentary valet to park the car. We waited about 30 minutes to be sat. Once sat we waited another long while for a server to come by and take our drink order. Dakota, our server, brought our drinks back and then disappeared for a while until coming back to take our order. We ordered two of the thanksgiving specials which comes with salad, two sides, turkey and dessert; we also ordered the one pound lobster tail, two crab cake appetizers and the Rockefeller salmon. The salads came out and we still had not received any bread or the appetizers. I had to ask the server if the crab cake was still coming or not. The crab cake arrived shortly there after. After finishing our salads and appetizer we still had no bread. We had to ask another server for bread to the table. Our entrees arrived soon after we got bread and were amazing. Everything was delicious absolutely no complaints of the food. However during the entrees, Dakota never came with refills and never stopped to check on everything. We then move onto boxing some entrees and getting the dessert, we waited about 15 minutes with no waiter and by the time we got to place the dessert order they had run out of the dessert we wanted. I got up to speak with a manager about the poor service and how it was unacceptable and he told me he would touch our table and speak with us directly. So we took the desserts Togo and waited for the checks. We had told Dakota at the beginning of the night we had two checks and how to split everything. The manager has still not stopped by and we are handed one check. So I asked a separate mama her from before to split the check and reiterated how bad the service was. This manager also assured me he would stop by and he would also adjust the check. Another 10 or so minutes goes by before we receive or checks. The adjustment was he took of the appetizers. After paying the bill a manager had still not stopped by. So we asked another server to bring a manager over. Once the manager got to the table all he had to say for the experience was that he agreed. He understood. It's safe to say we will not be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sullivan's is situated in the trendy South End location in Charlotte. They offer complimentary valet which is the best bet as parking can get tight.  I love the ambience and decor in the restaurant. Classical music played in the background that was nice to my ears as I felt like I was in another world.   Chris the waiter was great! He was very detailed, attentive and didn't miss a beat.   My meal consist of lobster bisque soup for my starter, salmon rockerfeller (bernaise sauce, crabmeat and bacon) for my entree and strawberry cheesecake for dessert. Ummm! The salmon was so flavorful, my taste buds were pleased! I had horseradish mash potatoes as my side and it was delicious. This is one of my top places to eat in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and this is easily one of favorite steakhouses! Top three! I have ordered something different each time and cannot complain about anything. The martinis are great and the wine lost extensive.  If you haven't been, you are missing out! Go ASAP."}
{"text":"Great experience; 2nd time is always the best. Start with the crab cake, it's fantastic. If you're not feeling a cut of meat, go with the seared scallops and as a side, I highly recommend the Mac and cheese. Very awesome, almost like it is made with cream cheese! Great wine selection, get a bottle for sure. Dessert, cookies and cream pie. I went on a date night and we got out of there for $185. Pretty reasonable considering other similar joints in Charlotte can run you $220 easy. Another bonus is valet is friendly and accommodating. Highly suggested my friends!"}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and it was really nice! We all ordered steak or salmon and it was delicious, wait staff was amazing and thought to our friends parents anniversary. Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"My review is only for the bar area. We did not eat in the restaurant.  Went here to listen to the jazz quartet and have dessert after a day out.  Dessert (I had the cheesecake, my companion had the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream) was really good.  We had coffee and water to wash our sweets down.  Our waitresses (we somehow ended up with two) were great. They both checked on us often enough and kept our drinks refilled as necessary.  We wanted to sit where we could see AND hear the musicians so we sat near the bar at a tall table, close to the patio area.  Great seats except that a slight smell of smoke wafted in continuously during our visit.   The quartet was fantastic. Great classic jazz, uptempo as well as laid back sounds.   I think they're in the wrong time slot as well as a bad location in the venue. They are set up in a back corner area of the bar area, where I assume seating was removed. It does appear the only location for them to set up comfortably.  However, because there are tv's in the bar and most of the seating in the area has patrons' backs toward the musicians, it doesn't seem likely that the quartet is getting enough visual or audio notice from the crowd.  The majority of the folk I observed in the time we were there (until 10 p.m., the same time the live music ends), seemed to be mid-30s. The folk who might enjoy the music seemed to gravitate toward the bar area around the time the group was packing up to leave.  Shame.  As a previous reviewer noted, the attire of the ladies working at the location is a bit short and tight (and the fishnets give them an air of \"Las Vegas showgirl\", in my mind) but it all fits the pseudo-upscale vibe I got from the place overall.  I don't usually frequent the south end area but if I'm in the area on a night the musicians are there, I'll drop in for dessert again."}
{"text":"After many delicious meals at Sullivan's sister restaurant Del Frisco's we were super excited to kick off restaurant week to compare the two. Sadly the experience at Sullivans was below expectations the entire night.   We showed up on time for a 7:00pm reservation and were told they overbooked and we would have to wait. We headed to the bar where I had to flag someone down for a wine list. When our table was ready (not a huge wait thankfully) we were escorted to our small table packed in the middle of two rows of booths. Being able to hear conversations quite clearly all around us did not provide the atmosphere of \"nice steak dinner\".   The Caesar salad that we both got was large, and had too much dressing for my taste, and the croutons were chewy like they weren't cooked long enough. My filet medallions were cooked as ordered but the steak lacked anything to recommend it. The horseradish potatoes had a very strong flavor that overpowered the steak. The end of the meal was the best part - my chocolate mousse was delicious but the boyfriend said his cheesecake was lackluster.    Even with the special restaurant week pricing the meal wasn't well priced enough for the quality of food we ordered. The restaurant was dimly lit and felt completely packed. I know that restaurant week, especially on the weekend, is a busy time for a restaurant but if the food and atmosphere are so uninspiring on a discount why would anyone return to pay full price?"}
{"text":"My birthday dinner was there and it had been a while since I'd been there. My steak was good however my potato needed help. Overall the dinner was delicious and I really enjoyed my pinapple Martini it was so smooth and delicious as I remembered. It was late and I had no desert but next time I will. My honey had a cowboy style steak and he enjoyed it too."}
{"text":"First, I'll start with the good.  The three cheese Mac was really tasty.  My Bells Two Hearted ale was awesome.  Okay, I'm done with the good.  The service was some of the worst I've ever had.  I can't blame the waiter 100 percent. He looked like he was working hard,  but when you place a drink or food order, you don't go to other tables and take orders before you put ours in.  We waited long lengths of time for almost everything.  We were a party of 8, so you expect it to take longer with larger parties, but we were there almost 3 hours.  They seemed very under staffed.  Finally got our dinner and two of the orders were wrong.  Everyone was done eating by the time their food finally came. No manager ever came to the table to apologize and nothing was offered for the major inconvenience.  I'm sorry, any reputable establishment would have comp'd the meal, or offered something.  I don't even think I've ever been to a restaurant where a manager doesn't come and and ask how your dining experience was going.  Apparently, that isn't important at Sullivan's.  Never even saw a manager to talk to.  The food overall was only mediocre, so you can't even say it was worth it, because of the cheaper  pricing of restaurant week.  I can tolerate mediocre food but not poor management.  Needless to say, there are so many good places to eat in Charlotte, there is no reason to ever come back here."}
{"text":"As a self-proclaimed foodie I naturally get very excited when Queens Feast arrives a couple times a year. I am one of those people who peruse the menu before the week even begins and plan out exactly where I am going several days in advance. Considering many of my friends are of the vegetarian variety I was really craving a long-overdue steak.   Sullivan's was convenient for its South end location, and we were able to get a nice reservation time to fit our schedule. I was impressed with the ambiance overall. It was cozy, very classy, and interesting. Photos of boxers align the walls and a large wine vault (mmm wine) displays their vast collection.   We were greeted right away by very friendly staff. The Malbec I ordered was delicious - but I could see the wine list being slightly intimidating for new wine drinkers as it looked more like a novel than a list. We then received our bread which was very difficult to cut (we even heard the couple next to us say the same thing) and overly flaky but overall it tasted fresh.   We decided to order the $30 Restaurant Week Menu but they had similar Summer of $69 (for two) menu that seemed to be a great deal as well. I started with just a classic Caesar salad (I have a thing for them) which tasted good but definitely wasn't anything super amazing. Next, I had the Filet with Horseradish Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans. The steak and beans were cooked wonderfully but I felt the potatoes could have used a little bit more of the Horseradish flavor. Overall the dish was excellent and definitely satisfied my hunger for a steak! Finally my date and I shared our two desserts Banana Foster Bread Pudding (WOW!) and the Chocolate Mousse. Both were very good but the Bread Pudding was a stand-out.   I want to try some other steakhouses in the area since Charlotte has a plethora of them but I would definitely recommend Sullivan's - it was very good!"}
{"text":"With a guest in town, headed to Sullivan's for a great steak in walking distance. Mid-week early dinner, so no concerns with a reservation. The bar looked nice and the decor in the rest of the restaurant is nice too. We both opted for the prix fixe menu, for me it was perfect since the filet is 6oz on that menu. My salad, filet, potatoes were great. My guest had a solid steak and bisque but potatoes were lacking compared to mine. Desserts were okay but nothing special...but neither of us are huge dessert fans. Overall for the price point this met my expectations with a really good steak and evening. Service was also good, wine was good and served properly, too. Will be trying the bar menu the next time I'm here. Probably not the best steakhouse I've been to in my entire life, but a solid option in South End for guests or a nice night out."}
{"text":"DO NOT EVER GO TO THEIR THURSDAY HAPPY HOUR IT SUCKS (PERIOD)...actually let me elaborate; the service is miserable and I wasn't ordering from their cheapo menu, bought a $50 app and had to grab my own FN silverware...this place is going downhill fast.  sucks i used to love sullivans but am having doubts about ever going back"}
{"text":"I personally don't think you can find better steak in Charlotte.    I've been to Capital Grill and found it overrated.  For great true quality, I always go to Sullivan's.  They have the best Ahi Seared Tuna, Blue Cheese Wedge, Steaks and some phenomenal desserts.  We tend to get the Filets but sometime is go for the Cowboy Bone-In Ribeye.  I highly recommend the Gorgonzola Butter on top of either!  Sometimes they put too much but it's an easy topping to rake off if you prefer small amounts.  Also, the sides... I had the Cream Corn this weekend for the first time and it was crazy good.  I love the Baked Potato with some fresh chopped bacon.  You get so used to the basics with that side... but to have it done right really makes you realize what you have missed in it.  It's fantastic.  Sometimes we can get the Souffle but often get the Brownie.  It's 'souffle like' with it's baking dish and is always moist.  Just remember to save some of that red wine to have with this dessert!    To those who left 1 Star : I challenge you to actually go and experience Sullivan's for what they are known for.  It's hard to go in and judge a restaurant based on their lowest priced menu and trying to get out on $20.  Experience it for what they specialize in.  A bar menu is meant to be that... it's a bar menu."}
{"text":"I decided for queens feast 2013 my friends an I would try Sullivan's .  I was blown away with the food an service .  First I started with the shrimp an lobster bisque soup lots of shrimp n lobster no holding back it was a creamy flavor that made me wanna pick the bowl up n lick it lol I ordered the 10 oz NY strip w mashed potatoes w/ broccoli an I ordered the Cabernet goat cheese butter an they gave you 2 jumbo grilled shrimp wow The steak was amazing flavor from the grill to a great cut of steak but the Cabernet goat cheese butter just melted so beautifully on top of my steak mmmm I was dragging my shrimp through the butter . As if I had any room left but than I went for desert lol I ordered the bananas foster bread pudding w ice cream oh my goodness it was so good and I'm not a bread pudding fan lol. The bread pudding was served warm n lots of bananas on it an the edges were good an crispy which I loved .  I will for sure be visiting Sullivan's again an all my friends enjoyed their meal the chicken picatta with capers amazing . If you get a chance go to Sullivan's an the staff were polite an didn't rush us."}
{"text":"Made reservation for 9:30, was sat at 10:12. Not sure what point our reservation served. As a frequent and loyal customer of Sullivan's, I've never experienced such a long wait time with a reservation. We were told numerous of times that our table was being cleaned off only to witness people come in after us to be seated before us. This did not leave a great taste in my mouth at all. It'll be a long time before I step foot back into this establishment. Our waiter was not attentive, he took our order and then brought our salad. The next we saw him was when we finished our meal. We had to look for him in order to ask for the check. This was definitely not the service that I am used to receiving. This delayed our entire evening and we were late to our next event."}
{"text":"Food was terribly salty, salads were inedible, poor service, average appetizers, disappointing wine by the glass selection, the steak was good, aside from the salt in the sauce, and it was cooked well. All in all, they are very proud of a mediocre experience. For the money, I will not return."}
{"text":"Sullivan's I like you. I think we'll always be friends with benefits and maybe even date, but I don't want to marry you and commit to you and only you for the rest of my life. There are just other steakhouses that mean a whole lot to me. I hope you understand.  Sullivan's is like a good friend to me - consistent, present and convenient. The steak and sides have always been solid and the patio is perfection on a warm spring evening. The staff is typically friendly and efficient - even when things get pretty hairy on a Thursday or Sunday evening when the major specials are available. Which leads me to those specials...as Todd W mentioned - Thursday offers $5 Knockout martinis and bar bites while Sunday typically offers a $30 per person three course meal. The Knockout martini is my jam, friends. This pineapple-y, vodka with a touch of orange concoction is my personal nectar from the gods. Get one or four...and find a designated driver.   The dining room is much quieter so if you're looking for a romantic or focused business evening, make a reservation. I fully appreciate Sullivan's consistency and the South End location doesn't disappoint. Thanks, friend."}
{"text":"Not a fan on the bar food. The oyster did not look good. The steakrolls were soaked in way to much sweet stuff. The place smelled like a cigar lounge."}
{"text":"It had been a few years since I had eaten at Sullivan's, but I recalled enjoying a great meal there for my former employer's Christmas party back in 2008.  With a $50 gift card in hand, we decided to head to Sullivan's to celebrate my husband's 30th birthday.  With expectations relatively high, I have to be honest and say that we were underwhelmed (and our pockets where overwhelmed, as the high prices did not reflect the quality of our experience).  We both ordered steak, which comes with a salad. We both opted for Caesar.  It was a very large portion, but lacking in flavor.  My filet was cooked properly, and the bourbon peppercorn sauce added a nice kick.  The porterhouse did not get such gleaming reviews.    The brussels sprouts were undercooked, but I have to say that the bacon pieces were delicious. The mushrooms were good, but I agree with another reviewer who said they were quite salty. And I am that person putting salt on everything, so that says something. We ordered a half bottle of Cote du Rhone, which was probably the highlight of the meal.  We opted out of dessert.  The service started out strong, but started to dwindle by the end. I just expect more of a high-end experience when you are dishing out $200 for dinner with no appetizer and no dessert."}
{"text":"Very mediocre at best. The waitress Tara was horrible. Very inconsistent throughout the whole entire dining experience. The wait time for food was extremely long but never once did she ensure us that the food was coming and checked on the table. Once we voiced our concerns she became a little apologetic by telling us she was trying to find a table that skipped their bill and how she had a $200 tab with this table. Clearly she was more concerned about that scenario than getting her manager involved and taking care of the table right in front of her helplessly looking for their waitress. On top of her horrible service, a service assistant told us to ease up on her because she is only here for 2 weeks because of a situation with her daughter. On top of that we never did anything to this poor woman other than inquiry about our dinner service, only one round of drinks orders because she wasn't present. Also no manager ever touched our table he walked passed several times never inquired about our dining experience. We were celebrating a birthday instead it was overshadowed by tara family issues and other things."}
{"text":"Came here on Thursday for a few glasses of wine and apps for the first time. They were quick at moving people in and valeting their cars. Once inside they gave the gentleman I was with his beer Ina plastic glass because they were running a special, we immediately returned it and asked for a glass. The cheeseburger rolls melt in your mouth, they were delicious! We also had shrimp cocktail and crab cake, which were great. At the end of the afternoon the valet got my car in a matter of minutes. Very impressed and I will return."}
{"text":"Went this past Friday during Queens Feast and it was amazing. My gorgeous date and I made reservations for 8.30 but had to push them back 15 mins. When we got there valet was prompt as we walked to the front desk they said the wait will be shortly. We grabbed cocktails at the bar, which they were excellent \"pours\", we then waited a little longer. The staff and the managers kept updating us on the wait. They finally had out table ready after 20 mins. They sat us down and the manger told our waiter \"Bob\"(who is awesome btw) to get us a appetizer on the house for waiting so long. The food was amazing, the service was excellent. I totally recommend Sullivan's as the perfect date night spot."}
{"text":"We went to Sullivans about a year ago on Mothers day.   The service was prompt and the food was great.  Sullivans has become my favorite steak restaurant in charlotte.    They have the best Fillet I have ever had in any steak house.  I have also heard people rave about their fried lobster.  I will definitly go back and I heard it is Restaurant week prices every Sunday."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner and had a great experience!  The food was wonderful, each course was excellent.  We really enjoyed the crab cake appetizer, steaks and the banana's foster bread pudding.  I highly suggest the Knock Out cocktail, it's perfect for this time of year.  Our server Jude was both professional and friendly.  Service was excellent.  What stood out even more about this restaurant though was seeing how everyone else was enjoying their experience!  I was sitting in the corner of the restaurant and had a great view of the dining room.  It was great to see people having fun conversations with the wait staff and enjoying themselves.  I feel like you don't see that too often.  You can tell that the staff at Sullivan's really cares about their patrons and in my book, that makes a restaurant memorable."}
{"text":"Yesterday my husband and I went to Sullivan's to celebrate my birthday. He decided to take me there to try someplace we haven't been. We are regular \"steakhouse \" eaters at various known venues. What I noticed immediately is that the ambiance was wonderful and clearly it is a well visited place by many. I liked that we were seated in the back, a very private area where you could have a conversation. The service was impeccable and it was clear our waiter knew what he was talking about regarding wine pairing and preparation of a steak. My issue was the food. I was truly disappointed on many levels.  We moved to Charlotte from PA and we've noticed it is very difficult to get a Pittsburgh style medium rare steak. My husband had to send his steak back for another try. All of my food was way too salty. Whom ever ran the kitchen this evening was heavy handed with the salt to the point that I did not enjoy my dinner. My shrimp/lobster bisque, too much salt. The shaved Brussel sprouts. Too salty, The Chil encrusted rib eye, way too salty. What I enjoyed about my dinner were the mushrooms, just right and the Sullivan's reserve Cabernet.  Oh the key lime pie was tastey. The over abundance of salt not only took away the natural flavors of the food( that you missed) but would give a healthy person high blood pressure. One of the evening managers did come to the table and was sincere in his disappointment. We most likely because of this experience will not return to Sullivan's because there are other steakhouses that have consistent outcomes."}
{"text":"The steak here was very juicy and delicious.  The atmosphere was classy and the service was very good.  I have enjoyed everything from the steaks to the sides here.  Would like to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Visited during restaurant week, (on a Sunday) and was happy with quality and quantity of food, special thanks to the $30 prix fixe menu. The service was top notch, as was the atmosphere. Two minor flaws kept me from giving a 5 star rating: Too much peppery seasoning on the NY Strip, which was of excellent quality and could have stood on its own - and the failure of the bartender to mention the $5 martini specials when as asked about them. (We found out during our meal from our waiter) All things considered, a great experience, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"It's been a couple years since our last visit. Not as good as we remembered. Service was fine - think our server was fairly new. No offer to decant a 2008 Insignia.  Steaks were great but you had to get an 8 oz filet - nothing smaller The shaved Brussel sprouts were really good.  We sent the au gratin potatoes back as they were cold. The replacements were fine and tasty The ambiance was noisy.  They charged a corkage of $25. Most high end steakhouses only charge if it's on their menu. We weren't even offered or provided a wine menu. Overall we prefer Ruth's Chris uptown as the service is much more attentive and the environment is not as noisy."}
{"text":"This 4 star rating is based on service. A friend asked me out to dinner here and I already knew I wanted scallops tonight before I looked at the menu. If they had scallops, it was predetermined that's what I would be ordering. So they come out after about 25 minutes. Four bacon wrapped scallops. However, they were covered in a peach BBQ glaze What an awful idea. Scallops are one of those foods that needs a sprinkle of salt and to be served with a half of a lemon. God makes them naturally flavorful. Anything heavy will overwhelm that flavor, which was the case here. So I forced myself to eat these candied scallops. I have no one to blame, but myself, for not reading the menu in detail and ordering seafood at a steakhouse. It simply isn't a smart move. So I'm not going to dock them for having a menu item that seems like a bad idea. The Roasted Corn-Jicama Slaw was unique and tasty. Service was fine. Having been to Sullivan's several times before, I can say there is always great service and a good atmosphere, especially in the bar area where some days there's live music. The dining area is a bit stuffy. Overall recommended."}
{"text":"This is a great all around place. I love the dining room because everything is delicious but my favorite is the bar.  I like to go there since they have a great Happy Hour menu between 5-7 nightly and all night on Thursday. The menu includes sliced steak, salmon and a killer hamburger. The staff is always fantasic and friendly. I like to eat at the bar and on nights when it isn't too busy the bartender will keep me company. If you don't mind sweet girly drinks, you have to try The Knockout Martini. It's a fantastic blend of pineapple and vodka and 1 or 2 will do the trick. On Thursdays the Knockout Martinis and select red/white wine is $5. That's a great deal.  If you are looking for a good Sunday deal, eat in the bar from the Sunday Prime Time menu. You get a full meal with dessert for a reasonable price. During Queen's Feast Week they also do a great meal for $30 but that tends to get so packed you may have to wait for a later seating. I would recommend going earlier when the restaurant starts serving and eating in the bar. I've never had a problem getting dinner there on nights other than Thursday. Thursday is their specials night and tends to become more of a \"Singles Bar\" feel. Every night except Sunday there is live Jazz in the bar. I can't help but love this place!"}
{"text":"I was taken here for lunch to celebrate professional administration day. We sat outside not realizing the black awning radiates heat.  Great for when it is cool, but a little too warm when it is 80 out.  The service was excellent. I had the seared ahi tuna and everyone else's food at our table looked amazing (Filet Mignon, Steakhouse Salad and Chicken Kale Salad).  I have a salt sensitivity so they worked with me with limited cajun spice and the sauce on the side.  We were all so very happy that we even got dessert.  Those desserts were to die for. The sales and event planner, Nichole Daniels, even came by our table to give us all a little gift for celebrating at Sullivan's.    I have only been here one other time and it was a little disappointing. I thought I would not come back, this visit has changed my mind and I am planning on bringing my husband for a date night soon."}
{"text":"We had a reservation and upon arrival we were told we would have to wait for a table to come available, after waiting 20 mins we decided to eat in the bar. Huge mistake.. Our waitress was very poor, we waited extended amounts of time for service and drinks. Her personality was great though, but personality does not get my drink. Ambiance? Yes there wasn't any, nor was there high end decor or finishes for the prices they charge for a meal. Laminated bar? Really? Also they dining/bar was very loud because of a large group of college boys ordering shots. Our food was cooked perfectly but management needs to work on everything else.. I would not reccomend."}
{"text":"Fabulous food. Fabulous service! Best steak in Charlotte. The Cowboy cut steak is to die for. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"In town for work and had the chance to catch it during restaurant week. Get the bay salmon and green beans. You won't be disappointed.  The mango sorbet was perfect, not fake mango flavored-had that real mango taste. Bar area was nice, bar hands are awesome. Had a few Moscow mules and enjoyed live entertainment on a Thursday night. Go, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Absolutely great place for a date. Although its kind of land locked, parking is not a problem, the valet service made us feel like someone important.  The ambiance was great, it was packed for Valentines day so we took a high top table in the bar. They had a jazz band (if you want to call it that, a piano player and bass guitarist) I had the filet and my date had a ribeye. Both were seasoned and cooked perfectly. Big helping for side items. Desserts are standard fare but very well done. One of the best meals I've had in a while. Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Sullivan's for some time and I finally got to go for restaurant week this week. I would go even if it wasn't, but it is a really good deal to get a three course meal for $35 . First I must say the ambiance was very nice there and it set the mood for a nice romantic dinner.   I highly suggest this place for a nice date, special occasion , or if you want a really good dinner. The service was the best part about this place. I felt as if the staff was going to get it wrong when we first came through the door because it was a bit chaotic.  Nevertheless, to my surprise they were on top of it.   We were asked how everything turned out and honestly I ordered a medium rare NY strip steak and got a medium steak. They mixed up our orders. I was beyond hungry at that time to wait for another steak so I ate it . It was delicious but hard not to compare to the quality of other steakhouses in the area. She got the filet mignon and that tasted better than my NY strip . Not to exclude the fact that she got the medium rare too.    Other than the mix up the place was great! The service, atmosphere, and food are all top notch.   I wish I could give this place five stars, like other restaurants on AP's famous must eat restaurants if you are in Charlotte (2018 version coming soon), but not just yet. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Sullivan's by far is our favorite restaurant in Charlotte! The best service staff around. Food is exceptional. Best creme brûlée in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Called last night after receiving terrible service at another restaurant. Needed a table for 17. They have us a private room with 2 servers!! Service was superb and good was amazing!! Made our holiday outing incredible!"}
{"text":"Had a limited availability item, a Wagyu cut. Perfection in any sense. Service was excellent. Sides of garlic mashed, garlic Mac and cheese and creamed corn where great. Topped it off with a Jack Daniels Single Barrel."}
{"text":"Went for a work event and was impressed witht he level of service and quality of food. I know with a large group (over 20) it can be hard on the server/kitchen but not here. All the food was fresh, delishious and came out at perfect temps. I had the roasted chicken which was very tender/moist and well seasoned with the mashed potatoes, equally as good and green beans. I would go back and eat again on my own based on this experience with the large group."}
{"text":"Our Anniversary Dinner was lovely and the staff was friendly. They took our picture, framed it with a Sullivan's photo holder and they all signed it.  Our server was nice but distracted and not attentive: forgot plate request for bread and drink refill request and us for most of the time.   Thankfully Susan was there with her lovely butterfly necklace and smile to bring the plate, refill the drink, take the plates, and bring the desert.  Thank all for lovely visit!"}
{"text":"We've been to Sullivan's 5 times.   The first time was fantastic and full price. The second time was Restaurant week. The 3rd, 4th, and 5th was for their Sunday Prime Time special for various occasions.  First thing I have to say is AVOID RESTAURANT WEEK.  They're way over crowded, the menu is limited, and you're going to wait.  Second thing... DEFINITELY hit their Sunday Prime Time Special.  For $32, you get twice the selection as restaurant week, and the food is prepared fresh.  Third... get the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding for dessert.  It's awesome.    Fourth... highly recommend Renee as a server.  She was attentive, friendly, helpful, and on top of things.    So in conclusion... 5 stars for Renee, the Sunday Prime Time Special & the bread pudding.  2 stars for restaurant week (and take any reviews written during restaurant week with a grain of salt)."}
{"text":"A vegetarian in a steak house!  Yes, it can happen.  My omnivore husband ordered their three course special:  calamari, the wedge salad, and beef medallions, which came with two shrimp and mashed potatoes. I chose the wedge salad, which, happily, did not come with bacon, horseradish mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  First, we were greeted with a hunk of bread that could have lasted us for a week.  I ate the jalapeño slices from my husband's calamari, which were simultaneously hot and sweet.  The blue cheese dressing on the wedge was a tad sweet for my taste, but topped with yummy blue cheese and fresh tomatoes.  The freshly ground pepper cut the sweetness of the dressing.  I could taste the nutmeg in the spinach, which was topped with a scattering of Parmesan.  The mashed potatoes were creamy, and I could taste the horseradish.  Although I could sense the apprehension our waiter felt when he realized that he was dealing with a vegetarian, he recovered from his surprise quickly and delivered impeccable service."}
{"text":"Seated on time, no delay with reservation. Food very good food and service. Well worth the money. Parking is tough have to use complimentary valet."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! We had a HUGE party last night/ 30 people.  Service was great.  The crab legs were so big and meaty!!! Filet was amazing and the side dishes were huge!"}
{"text":"I took 3 of my coworkers here for dinner.  It was simply excellent and the service exceeded expectations.  No stuffy wait staff either.  The hostesses could act a little more interested.  Everything we had was excellent...  Shrimp Cocktail - excellent, huge, cocktail sauce so delish.  Caesar Salad - fresh, crisp, very tasty dressing but not overpowering.  Bread - warm, fresh, had to fight over last piece  Wine - excellent selection. I am not a connoisseur by any stretch but its a great offering.  Steak - of course, the steak... cooked to perfection and oh so amazing.  I ordered the filet.  Wow!  I skipped dessert.  Who has room after all the other stuff!  I did have a coffee.  It was well brewed, served hot.  About a week after my visit, I received a thank you card in the mail from our server and she remembered a couple of things about our conversation - like my recent visit to Switzerland.  A few days after that, I got a thank you card from one of the managers.  What a nice touch."}
{"text":"Dress nice when you come for dinner there is a bar area in case you feel a little under dressed. The steak is amazing here and I always choose to add the goat cheese butter to the top of my medium Rare steak because I feel like it was sent from heaven! The Oysters Rockefeller is good but one serving is never enough for me. The wine menu is extensive and in my opinion I don't like the pineapple martinis (never have) but the bartender here knows how to make an awesome mojito which in this town seems difficult."}
{"text":"Last night I went with a group of friends to Sullivan's Steakhouse for a birthday dinner. It's definitely a nice place to go to have dinner. The food was ok, I just think it's not worth the price. The Caesar salad is just a big piece of lettuce with Cesar dressing which kind of disappointed me. I ordered the salmon which was good but small, with the asparagus which was not seasoned. Now I will say that the cheesecake is amazing. Another thing was we ordered champagne and the glasses were dirty. The waitress had to go back three or four times to get clean ones. She was a nice lady, she even saved us some money by showing us a deal. After we was done eating we were ready to pay, the waitress took almost 45min to bring us our ticket and even longer to check us out. Other than that it's a nice restaurant, just over priced."}
{"text":"My wife and I went it Sullivan's Steakhouse last Thursday it was my first time since being in Charlotte I was pleasantly surprised. The service was great as well as the food. We really enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Jan 1 2017 after dinner at another near by steakhouse my girlfriend and I decided to check out the bar at Sullivan's before headed home . I was desperately dying for this dessert that another sister restaurant had but was closed so to my surprise Sullivan's had a better version !!!  Yay me ! I love the bar there !  It's so beautiful and it's always interesting conversations going on ( I like to ease drop ) . The bartender is Amazing  !!!!!!!' I prob couldn't have asked for a better bartender! Hell , I would write a review just off her . Now , I can't tell you her name ; not that I don't want to . I can't remember  ( something French sounding :John pi' Dom  )  She made me s few of these drinks she called nuts and berries and I was sold!  Everything was amazing! Please try the Banana Foster Bread Pudding.  Your mouth will thank you later!  But, this is a good example of how you can take a good bar and make it an outstanding bar just by having the right people behind it ."}
{"text":"Went to sullivans a few months ago on a thursday with live band playing. Was fairly packed and a good vibe. Drinks specials for martinis were  very good. Was very impressed with the selection and pricing of thier bar bites-- i hope this is still available?! the steak from the bar menu was a generous portion as was the fish. Would definently go back for this."}
{"text":"I frequent this place a lot. The filet will melt in your mouth!!! Great place for an anniversary dinner or other special occasions.  Staff is always professional and on the spot.  Might be a tad bit pricey for most people but well worth it."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service as always!  We enjoyed the Knockout, Filet, Salmon, Horseradish mashed potatoes and warm chocolate brownie tonight."}
{"text":"I had booked on OpenTable and when I arrived on time, we were immediately seated to a table even though there were others waiting near the hostess stand. Awesome.  Looking over the menu, I had made my decision from the rather expensive listing of steaks and side dishes. That changed when our waiter - Matt, who was awesome - went over the evening's specials. Suddenly, the idea of a trio of small filet mignons was what I wanted and each with a different topping/sauce. Massive wine list but only a small list of beers and an even smaller list of local beers. In fact, just one. OMB Copper.   All three of us started with the wedge salads. These were good portions with plenty of blue cheese to go with the lettuce and chopped tomatoes. Not a bad deal for $4!  When they arrived, the steaks looked perfect. Three small filets, each in a different sauce. The first two, a bearnaise and an Oscar, I enjoyed thoroughly. Perfectly cooked and with the right amount of sauce on top. But by the time I had cut into the third one, it was no longer quite so perfect. More overdone than I ordered and a bit of a tougher cut, especially since the first two were so good. Bummer.  For dessert, I let Matt talk me into the bread pudding. It was... fair. Just not that great with not enough taste and some of the topping was over done. I wouldn't have this again.  On the pros list, no wait for a seat when we had a reservation, excellent service from Matt, a local beer choice, great salad, and great steaks.  On the cons list, the booth was a bit too tight for the three of us to sit comfortably. Perhaps another inch or two, please? Only one choice for a local beer. Most of the steaks were great and the dessert was only fair.  Complimentary valet parking is nice, as there is not much street parking nearby.  Sullivan's is a higher-end steak joint and works hard to earn that high dollar menu."}
{"text":"Short and not so sweet on this one. When I am picking up a check for 10 people in a location that charges a rather high amount you expect great food, great service, and a great atmosphere.  Great atmosphere? 3 stars due to the lack of lighting Great Service? 5 Stars, very professional and accomidating, and very very apologetic.  Great Food? Negative 10. When I am in a dark setting (meaning low light) and I am served a \"RAW\" blood reddish pink piece of Pork then nothing else matters. When cooking with pork or thick chops one should be using a meat thermometer and serving at 170 degrees center point not room temperature. With this said, the staff and management did everything they could to make it right. A fluke, maybe but one that the manager will need to address with his kitchen staff."}
{"text":"My steak was over cooked and covered in a thin tastless gravy.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Dropping Sullivan's down to 4 stars, rather than 5, because one of (if not their best) attribute was their wide selection of drink specials on Thursday and Sunday.  They increased the price of the specials and reduced it to only 1 drink.  Still a good restaurant, but the value is no longer as high."}
{"text":"We came in as a last minute reservation as a party of 17 due to an issue with the steakhouse down the street where our original reservation was. We were treated like valuable guests and were given excellent service and food. Overall the ambiance was great, food was good and service was excellent! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week this past summer. Food was good. Menu options were also good. Service was average, at one point a bus boy dragged a trash can right through the restaurant. Expected better brig a del friscos sister restaurant, but overall average. Good wine list."}
{"text":"Amazing steak,  best I've ever had!!!!  So much flavor in everything they have!!!!  Service was excellent so personable and very good suggestions!!!!!"}
{"text":"Knock out martinis are awesome!  $7 happy hour drinks on Wednesday- great deal.   Wait staff, Ericka, and others were friendly and helpful. Banana Fosters Bread was delicious - do yourselves a favor and try it.   Great atmosphere. Watching game, while listening to a live band. Wonderful place to be on a weeknight with friends."}
{"text":"A few friends had sworn up and down Sullivans was cheaper and better than other quality chain steakhouses we carnivores adore. As the much beloved, highly anticipated QC restaurant week is off the starting gates, Sullivans is the first stop in this possible gout inducing road trip of gluttony that would make Henry the VIII envious.   First impressions aren't much to gloat about. While calling for a reservation, I was told 8:45 was the next available spot. After having to confirm with my dinner mates, I had to wait on hold for ohhhh only a measly 7 or 8 minutes. Hmrph, lets try this again. Hung up and redialed, new person and now it's 8:30; uh okay that works, lets roll on out!   Upon arrival, complimentary valet - not too shabby. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated so, \"please enjoy yourselves at the bar and listen to the live jazz band.\" I can dig it, dirty martini time! At only $10 for house vodka, oh Sullivans you sly dog, I like you already.   Bingo! Our names were called to be seated and after you wait for the hostesses to finish gossiping amongst themselves and finally seat you, the adventure begins. The dining room is lined with booths and a nifty library looking room adds to the Chicago, Dick Tracy-esque decor. The booths though, don't really sit 4 people comfortably.   Since it's restaurant week, the $30 meal is offered along with a \"Summer of '69\" for two which has slightly different options and two sides. Apparently its offered all summer and cost $69, heh go figure.   Summer of 69 it is, with asparagus and crab fried rice as sides. While the crab fried rice is pretty tasty, the asparagus was itsy bitsy, teeny tiny. Salmon is pretty tasty and very buttery - meaning good salmon.   Now, on to my carnivorous inner caveman. The filet; I loved it, but am upset at the chef. The steak itself was way too heavily over salted. Once you cut through the Bonneville Salt Flat crust though, what a mighty fine, tender, flavorful piece of meat. The key lime pie for dessert wasn't key to the meal, but was limey.  Service was great, the waiter was on top of his game and while the overall meal wasn't top notch, Sullivans is pretty smooth. Since it's a slightly cheaper date, I hope to visit more often. I just hope next time the chef doesn't take out his pent up frustration on the salt shaker."}
{"text":"We had probably the worst experience tonight. We love steak and will typically eat any that comes our way. The steak here was just awful. We waited a very long time for our meals and when our bone in ribeye and KC strip arrived they were both very cold and overly chewy for steaks that are served medium rare to medium. We brought this to the attention to the manager and his response was an indifferent 'What do you want me to do?' I would think trying to serve a high quality meal would be rather obvious. Unfortunately we did not get that tonight. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I've been here on several occasions, and the service and food have been top notch. My steak is always cooked just right, and the potatoes and asparagus are great! Go for the dessert, the key lime pie or the cheese cake, you will not be disappointed. The atmosphere is nice and they have valet parking, which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Warm and appealing restaurant. The drinks were good. (order the lemon blueberry martini!) Odd choice of background music, though. Not that I don't love me some 60s Motown; just strange having James Brown screeching in the background of a somewhat upscale chain restaurant. The food was okay. I ordered the filet; it was well past the medium I requested and, to my taste, everything seemed extremely salty, including the horseradish mashed potatoes and the mushroom caps. The server was quite attentive, almost a little too much so; it was hard to carry on a conversation. But I guess that's quibbling and better than having to hunt down your server. As someone mentioned, the banana bread pudding was to die for."}
