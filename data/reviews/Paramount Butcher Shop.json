{"text":"A great addition to the neighbourhood unlike their resto (uninspiring mediocre food) next door. Everything -w/a middle eastern twist- is good to delicious, super clean (well it's new), and staff are very friendly and helpful. 

While Camden butcher shop is our favourite in the neighbourhood, this is more affordable. 

And already been there twice in a week."}
{"text":"Love this place, simple, clean and minimal in the \"extras\".

I heard the infamous chain opened up a butcher / halal meat shop relatively downtown and I was willing to trek for quality halal meat. Impressed by the general atmosphere, friendly staff and willingness to help with personalized cuts. 

Hot tip- they have delicious halal salami (the dry kind) and some other deli meats. 

I prefer this location as it's right on the subway. They have short ribs and a variety of premartinated meats. 

I took one star off because they offered vacuum sealing for the meat but I was charged $1.00 per package and it wasn't disclosed to me until I paid."}
