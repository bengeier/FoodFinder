{"text":"this is for the fireside lounge.
great place to finish the night off or start it.  the appetizers were large portions and the well drinks were also great.  it has a old las Vegas feel to it"}
{"text":"We came here for a good inexpensive breakfast & that is exactly what we got. They have big portions. So sharing is good if u don't want to be stuffed. We had the cheese omelette w/hash browns & a pancake. It was all great, the hash browns are outstanding, taste homemade. The pancake is enormous, light & fluffy but thick @ the same time. All in all a good breakfast @ a great price."}
{"text":"Breakfast served 24 hours, waitstaff is efficient and friendly, drinks are a good pour, what more do you need?"}
{"text":"Had a fun time at Peppermill. Servers were friendly,  decor was wonderfully cheesy,  the food was as better than expected. Well, dinner was better than expected. Dessert was disappointing. We shared a strawberry shortcake and it was underwhelming. They used  strawberry syrup like from McDonald's and a flavor less cake. I think it's because there are do many great places to get dessert in this town,  I'm surprised when something on the Strip disappoints. I would go back, the lounge and entrées are throwback classics. And we really enjoyed the server.  Just know there are better sweets all over this town."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome staff, the wait to get in may take awhile but once seated and your order is taken, your food comes soon after"}
{"text":"Came here after reading some yelp reviews.  We were staying at the Stratosphere so it was close by and a much better choice than IHOP.  Rather pricey for a diner but when reviewers said the dishes were large, they weren't kidding.  There were 5 of us, we ordered 4 breakfast entrees and would have had plenty of food with 3.  The Ambrosia french toast was as good as it looks in the picture.  Tons of fresh fruit."}
{"text":"The service is very efficient, the people are very kind and welcoming. The food I real great and there is a wide variety to which suits everybody. It has a very prime location right on the strip. My only downside is that the  interior is very dark and the the restaurant is also slightly hard to find."}
{"text":"this place is great. came here about twice now. food is exceptional. i got the nachos and some friends got very different entrees. i am a nacho fan and these nacho were really good. not to mention the size of these things. i love the rainbow sugar they have. i think i consumed a bit too much. the second time i tried this place. it seemed like the prices went up and the portion size got smaller. probably the only reason why i have not gone back. oh wells, this place is good. would recommend for first timers. its a fun place to be."}
{"text":"Uhhhh NO. Throwback joint that has a cool atmosphere, however I'm rating this place on how their food tastes - which is like nothing ! No flavor and bland af. I'd rather hit up McDonald's than go out of my way to come here again. Too many good places to eat at in Vegas than to waste your efforts and time here. Next!"}
{"text":"When I asked the driver to take us to a place near the LV Convention Center for breakfast, I naturally assumed he'd drop us off at the nearest Denny's. Instead, he brought us to Peppermill, a throwback diner with a strip club feel. When we walked in, I couldn't decide if I was looking at a scene from National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation or a Tarantino film.

The décor was straight from the 70s with fake hanging plants and booths wrapped in hot pink and blue neon lights (hence the strip club feel).  The patrons were equally colorful on a weekday morning.

The food was good old Americana. Huge portions and decent prices. $11.50 for 3 eggs, 3 big sausage links, really crispy tasty hash browns, and toast. Coffee mugs were latte size, so you didn't have to wait around for a refill (a plus if you're a caffeine addict like me) which was good because although the server was friendly, she rarely stopped to check on us. Our table was the only table that didn't have regular sugar packets, which we didn't notice that until AFTER we used what we assumed was sugar from the container on the table. It was sugary (red, white, blue pellets) and left a candy like floaties in my coffee. I kept waiting for the hallucinations to start, but ultimately no harm done. 

Overall, it's nothing spectacular, but I love finding new spots and taking in the local color (neon and all). Worth a stop if you're hungry and  on that end of the strip."}
{"text":"I think I hyped this place up in my mind a bit too much, but it was still pretty good. I was really hungry from a long flight and Peppermill was a short walk north of our hotel. The 70s dinner theme was cute. There was a cocktail waitress taking drink orders at 10am, but the drinks took a really long time. Pretty good drinks, though. The highlight was the sugar shaker, which was full of sprinkles. Not your average sprinkles, either. They went really well with our pancakes. The food was good but not out-of-this-world. A good breakfast spot if you are staying north of the strip, but I wouldn't make it a destination. 


3.5 stars.

Visited June 2013"}
{"text":"Went with a group of ppl celebrating the birthday of my twin brothers and the waitress got everyone's order except mines. So here I am sitting while everyone is eating by the time my food was ready our party was done eating. I refused the food and we paid and left."}
{"text":"Gaudy- the best word for the decor! I love this place.  We had gotten off the plane in the middle of the night and wanted good eats and drinks with convenient parking before heading to where we were staying. Peppermill seemed to be the type of place I was looking for.  I was delighted to see free parking and their own parking lot and equally as delighted at the ridiculous decor inside! The menu is huge. My boyfriend had an omelet and I had a panini and fries and we were both stuffed. Glancing around it looked as tho all of the portions were just as big. Once we were done eating we ventured into the lounge and had a seat at the bar and eventually seats cleared out at the cozy fire pit which is surrounded by red rounded couches and lots of mirrors. We enjoyed big tropical drinks and people watched.  The Peppermill is the type of place where anything seems to go...exhausted travelers such as ourselves were welcomed during the week but an evening gown and tux would work just as well. IF you want some late night eats after a night out drinking in a really cool environment I would call this a must do."}
{"text":"Pros: Friendly staff, good portions, tasty food
Cons: May need to wait for a table, greasy/heavy food, no cheaper eats for someone not looking for a big meal.

Going to a diner, I should probably expect heavier/greasy food but they even go as far as putting a generous helping of whipped butter on your toast.  After all the buffets and other heavy foods, I'd really like something toned down just a notch."}
{"text":"If you want quality food and bang for your buck.... This is the place to go!!! Delicious breakfast food and a unique atmostphere. Fun place to go with friends and family"}
{"text":"If you're craving Jersey diner food in the middle of Vegas, you've truly hit a reverse jackpot. I mean that in the sincerest of ways; diner food in Jersey is awesome and this is the opposite. We ordered burgers, a gyro and a turkey salad; all were seriously bad news. The burger tastes charred, the gyro seemed like frozen meat and the turkey in the salad looked canned. The ice cream was good, but I'm assuming it was store bought. 

The one star is for the entire staff being cheerful and either sadly believing this food is good, or being able to fake it for so long with a smile."}
{"text":"Great spot to go after the loooong night out. :-)
 Love their breakfast menu, my favorite is probably the fruity waffle. Portions are very large, I cant ever finish them. 
Another great thing about this place is the atmosphere, you're surrounded by the trees and neon lights.
Also big plus for serving good coffee in oversize mugs."}
{"text":"Peppermill is by far my favorite place in vegas!!!! I love that they are true to who they are and haven't changed their decor to look more modern. I love the atmosphere and the portions are huge!!! Being open 24/7 is a plus too. Nothing like a huge quesadilla at 3am after drinking lol. The staff is sooo friendly too. I stop here every time I go through vegas"}
{"text":"This review is for the  dining room only, not the bar/ lounge:


Most places in las vegas close at or about 10:00pm on any given day however the peppermill is constantly open.

Nice and polite staff -

Great food -

and depending on the dishes you order; Giant portions.


I have a few dishes and I consider the caprice sandwich [I think its name is the caprice] is the worst dish I had; while the reuben sandwich is practically the best you could ever have.

While its not like the top restaurants at the Aria and the Wynn; you will not be disappointed at the food they have there. If for nothing else, the outfits the waitresses wear do make the experience that more enjoyable.

If you ever have a chance to to anywhere to eat in las vegas, I would greatly recommend the peppermill."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for dinner and cocktails on a Saturday night after friends we were traveling with got several referrals to check this place out. It's down the strip near the Riviera Casino. 

We walked into the lounge area as there was a wait for the diner side and decided we just had to hang out on the lounge side! The seating area is low back velour couches with little marble pedestal tables. There are neon lights and plastic flowers and mirrors! Oh the mirrors! Cue the 70's music!!!  The servers wear 70's style long black nightgowns and are very friendly. 

Ok food and drinks- we tried a few of the specialty drinks (green tea martini, oatmeal cookie martini with ice cream of course, espresso martini, White Russian). They make a solid drink here. We ordered a few appetizers- be warned they are enormous. Our little pedestal table was overwhelmed. The food on the lounge side was basic bar appetizer fate- but it's the atmosphere that wins here. 

There is a fire water table thing in the center of the lounge as well- very cool. Overall a very funky fun place to hang out. I will be adding it to my list of stops next trip.  

Don't forget to break out your leisure suit!"}
{"text":"I've always had great service,  except this afternoon 3-430pm .y husband and I shared the white cod fried fish which was very sub-par over done and baked potato not baked enough to softly mix but it was stiff,  ready for potato salad.  We mentioned to waitress but No interest , disappointed."}
{"text":"Good service, tasty food, and the \"fruit cup\" was fresh fruit.  I was put off by the coffee that is priced at $2.95 but it was delicious and my waitress offered me a go cup.  
She didn't fill it with the half cup I had left, she filled it up with fresh.  We'd eat here again!"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary's were amazing, eggs gave all of us the heartburn from hades. I don't ever get heartburn but I had it for the entire day. No tums or GERD medicine was going to fix it. So I suggest the bacon and pancakes! The wait was about thirty minutes long but we stuck around in the lounge and drank mimosas and Bloody Mary's.  Service was quick and we enjoyed ourselves. They take a free pic and come back with a larger version for $25 (why is it always $25-40 for a picture here) or the tiniest one for free. The girl taking the picture was strange... but it was a funny souvenir."}
{"text":"After reading several bad reviews for breakfast at this restaurant I decided to avoid it and try dinner instead. I ate on two separate nights and enjoyed good food and service each time. Everything was reasonably priced and the menu was fairly diverse. If you're looking for a good meal at a decent price I'd reccomend it."}
{"text":"I don't know why this restaurant had such good Yelp reviews. Firstly, the wait to get a table was over an hour. I ordered a Peach mimosa which was ok but not worth the 10.00. For breakfast, I had the Marco Polo which was also ok but a little bland. My husband had the pancake breakfast and he liked it. The waitress was hurried throughout the order and only stopped by when she was dropping off food. When asked for more water, etc. she seemed very put out. The restaurant ambiance was cheap, old school Las Vegas. Overall, not impressive especially considering there was such a long wait to get seated. The portions are big and that's cool. If you are in Vegas for a long time and are super bored, this place is for you. If you are here for a short trip, skip this place and don't waste any gambling time or the chance to eat at much better places on the strip."}
{"text":"Awesome bloody Mary's and a fun ambiance in the lounge area! Portion sizes are huge so unless your starving I'd suggest sharing. Food was great service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Was very surprised at how much we liked this place.  Walked in during the afternoon and sat around one of the fire places.  Was greeted almost immediately by a waitress, who was dressed in a very nice black dress.  She sat next to us and took our order and answered any questions that we had.  Very attentive and very friendly.  Drinks were well made and loved the environment.  The only complaint I had, was that we were sitting too close to the bar, so you did get the smoke coming by you, if you don't like smoke like we don't, I would just recommend sitting farther away from the bar."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food hugh portions for the resonable prices and the great service. Can I say clean no food on the floor tables clean no food on seats. I walked in got seated quickly, and my food within 10 minutes and it was rush hour lunch time. I meet the manager Peggy wonderful!! I recommend it go eat there you have nothing to lose and a great experience to gain. Love the lights inside...."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Las Vegas last week. On Sunday 21 July 2013, we were coming out of the Riviera casino (show \"Illusions\") and used the Yelp app on my phone to find a place to eat. Because of the reviews on Yelp, we decided to try the Peppermill Restaurant located next to the casino.

The reviews were right. The place is very unique with lots of neon lights and spacious tables. The food was great and the portions too big to finish. Service was great and prices very reasonable. It was later at night but the place was still very busy but we did not have to wait. If you are looking for a fun dining experience in a diner type restaurant, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Big portions! Great service!"}
{"text":"Only in Vegas. Kinda like a Denny's with a fire pit and roller skates. It's kitch, and it's fab. It's hard not to love this place. From what I remember at least. You won't leave hungry if you order food. And if you don't- you won't be dissapointed with the eye candy or the drinks. It's 24 hrs after all and Vegas is a 24 hr city...so at some point you should end up here. Good spot for pictures..."}
{"text":"Late night craving for diner food? Skip the Denny's, go to the Peppermill. This place is open 24 hours and always is filled with entertaining people (most likely drunk, or acting like they are just because they are in Vegas) watching. Don't let the decor scare you, at first it's a little overwhelming, but you will grow to love the cheesiness of it. The corned beef hash is pretty good here. It's not crispy like I would prefer, but it's the perfect combination of just corned beef and potatoes. I can't tell if service (food wise) is slow here or if it's just because I'm always starving when I come here. Either way, the servers are really accommodating.

*Usually a little tipsy when I come here so unsure about food being as good sober, but drunk me loves this place*

{"text":"I don't really understand the hype of this place. The interior is dark and dingy (borderline tacky) and the food isn't all that great.

Usually when you are slightly intoxicated everything tastes GREATTTT, however when I took a bite into my steak it was just meh.

I really don't know what else to say other then I didn't find the food or atmosphere all that special."}
{"text":"usual good, always entertaining especially late night crowd, big portions and large menu, service sometimes lacks so only 4"}
{"text":"lived in Vegas for 7 years and this was the first time I visited the Peppermill. The food was great. The place is crowded and way too noisy but it was fun. Huge portions although the service was slow because it was crowded. Our server was excellent and kept us filled with coffee and soda. Overall a delightful experience."}
{"text":"Imagine Denny's with portions twice as large, food quality a little better, and a decor that is totally fun, old school, 80's Las Vegas. Oh, and add pretty servers in short skirts.  This place is 5 star fun with 3.5 star food.  Definitely a good deal and a great place to sop up the booze with a big, late night breakfast.  Don't forget to take a peek at the fireside lounge before you go.  It's fun too."}
{"text":"Good ol' american food!  Love the atmosphere and theme.  The waitstaff and service were awesome.  The waitress was super nice."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It definitely has a feel of old school Las Vegas and that's what makes it so unique. Pepermill is also 24hours, a huge plus!

They have two parts, pepermill restaurant and fireside grill. When you first walk then you see pepper mill and then there is Fireside further back where you can sit at the bar or near a beautiful fire pit that sits in water in the middle of a huge round table. 

We had someone come take our picture and give us a little keep sake. The food was good and portions were large.

If you go to pepermill you have to order the blueberry muffin instead or toast... it's warm and served with cinamon butter... trust me it's amazing! 

We liked pepermill so much that we went there twice during our weekend stay.... it's worth all the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Ah...The Peppermill, what can I say about the fireside lounge.  It's an old school Vegas must see.  I take all of my friends from out of town here.  Everything looks like it just fell out of the Robert Urich TV show Vegas, the fabulous pink décor, the fire pit and the cocktail waitresses in the long evening gowns.  They have a fun specialty cocktail menu and they play music videos on the many TVs throughout the labyrinthine lounge."}
{"text":"I am so glad I finally got to experience the old more iconic side of Vegas this weekend.  This place is totally excellent.  Today with all the new Vega$ sometimes it is great to go back to the start.  I visited both the Lounge and restaurant.  The late night food was simple and good, which certainly helped after cocktails. If you like the idea of the old Vegas with, Elvis, & Rat Pack days, then you should stop in for a drink or bite and experience a true treasure. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The pepper mill is a classic. It's definitely a good spot to check out on the late night in vegas. I don't think it's the type of place you go before you go out for a nice night. They have all types of good variety food. The food is perfect cure for hang overs or a solid breakfast. I recommend it after a loooonnnngggg night out!"}
{"text":"Natalie is amazing at the firepit...its a great place to eat and hang at the end of a long party night..."}
{"text":"Good food big portions nice ambience"}
{"text":"It was great, staff was nice , food was fabulous and you get plenty of food,waitress was kind and did a great job..... plenty of food to choose from,"}
{"text":"Excellent food and price for anything you want at any time of day. If you want steak at 7:00 am. Or pancakes at 7:00 at night, it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Here's another one of my Vegas favorites. A great place for a first date or taking friends from out of town. The ambiance here is simply one of a kind. 

More neon, mirrors, and red velvet than you can shake a stick at! Oh and the video screens everywhere with cool 80's videos, those are great. 

If you can, get a seat next to the water feature with flames ripping out of it, it's a little warm but pretty cool. 

I've never actually eaten in the restaurant but the food in the lounge is pretty tasty. The selection is standard bar fare. 

The cocktails are not the cheapest in town but they're pretty good, and delivered by sexy ladies. The super sized scorpion is good for a group. 

Some of my best nights have ended here. Skip the other late night eateries and head straight for the Peppermill!"}
{"text":"Classic Vegas!   This restaurant has amazing service and even better food.  The omelettes are the best we ever had.  Be sure to go in back and check out the fireside room-it's incredible!"}
{"text":"This is a different kind of place...in a good way. Inside has pink and blue neon looking lighting. And 70s looking booths. The restaurant is clean. Food is good. Wide variety on the menu. This place has been around a long time, used in a variety of Vegas themed movies.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner or late night--the place is always busy. Get away from the strip casino restaurants and try the Peppermill. Be sure to also try the attached fireside lounge before or after your meal. It is different too. And good. You will want to come back to both the restaurant and lounge again. Give it a try. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just wow Peppermill.  You had me at Hello.   

Peppermill is an institution in Vegas.   Walk in here and you walk back in time. There is no question about where you are - 1970s. Vegas.  Neon lights.  Crushed purple velvet.  Mirrors. Vintage waitress outfits.   Worries left at the door.  Yuppp, this place is da bomb.  Our friends who are locals brought us here, and good thing they did because I never would have found it, even though I Yelp and read Chowhound extensively.  Actually we walked by it a few times (we stayed at the Hilton about a block away) and I did wonder what the story was with the place...there is something so non-descript and mysterious about it.  Curiosity solved - we came for breakfast on Sunday morning, whole place is packed with a crowd waiting at the slot machines. Wait doesn't take long though. Look around and everyone is drinking  Bloody Marys.  I had the Tequila Sunset and French Toast with fruit and boysenberry syrup - delish! My husband had the chorizo eggs with refried beans, also very good.  Overall, Peppermill is a great diner and the quintessential Vegas experience.  I'll definitely be coming back here on future trips to Sin City."}
{"text":"Try feta cheese & vegetable or asparagus omelet here.  The hash browns are crispy and one of the best I've tasted. Fast service, people watching late night is entertaining, be sure to check out the lounge. It's a Vegas experience worth checking out if you are visiting town. I recommend."}
{"text":"Away from the 24 hour buzz of the casinos and entertainment parks that occupy the strip you'll find the Peppermill Restaurant.... This place is a landmark and an excellent venue to escape the entertainment complex and enjoy a quality meal with a little 1960's charm. The female staff here are a bunch of old Vegas retiree dancers that wear tiny jumpers and shiny tights! (bow chica wow wow!) It's also got a kind of jungle decor to it, plus all kinds of shiny mirrors and neon lights - quite tacky. The food is great with enormous servings that can easily be shared between 2 and sometimes possibly 3 people. A good variety of breakfast choices 24/7. You'll definitely hit the food jackpot when eating here. Recommended to any Vegas visitor who want to enjoy a solid dining experience."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is highly recommended- even The Killers' singer Brandon Flowers and guitarist Dave Keuning, who both live in Las Vegas, like this place because it's more local, and a break from all the tourists. But I'll stop and let this interview excerpt do the talking: 

\"Flowers and Keuning head for lunch at the Peppermill, an all night restaurant on the strip. It opened in the seventies, and it's just the kind of place the Killers dig- a bit weird, and seemingly immune from vacationing Midwesterners. \"We hate big crowds,\" Keuning says.\"You can always just pop in and get a bite here. It's a cool place.\" Eating their salads and runny egg specials, Keuning and Flowers stick out among the Peppermill patrons, most of whom are dressed in tees and tank tops. Flowers wears a cream colored, fake alligator skin jacket he got in London: Keuning is in a shiny gray vest and Dior aviators. But no one bothers them or even seems to recognize them, and you sense that's one reason they like places like the Peppermill. Especially Flowers.\"

So go on, maybe you'll even spot Vegas' most famous rock band...

{"text":"I ordered the CFS and my husband got the Southwest Chicken Salad. Our waitress ended her shift and didn't put our order in so we waited a long time for our meal. I loved the CFS but everything was cooked in an oil that I didn't really like the after taste of. But smothered in gravy and didn't notice it on the CFS. My husband salad was very much lacking. It had very nice tortilla pieces in the center but they were so stale they weren't very edible. There really wasn't enough beans or avocado to really make this a southwestern. The chicken was cooked very well, very juicy. But overall not worth the price. Luckily we got 25% off for the wait. 

We went to the Fireside Lounge and this visit was totally redeemed. It was early on Tuesday and plenty of seating available. We got a nice little corner in front of the fire pit. Gorgeous! We ordered the Scorpion and it was Delicious! Well worth $18. It's a great romantic environment. I will be returning whenever we have family in town."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The fireside lounge is legendary!  It's flashy!  It's SO Vegasy!  But...that's just icing on the cake (ahem). The food is so good and will fill up someone with the heartiest of appetites.  Wait staff is friendly and the food arrives promptly and hot!  Depends on what you're in the mood for - the menu is like a diners with ample variety but not so much that it's overwhelming.  The salads just happen to be a favorite of mine.  Love the Cobb, but today it's breakfast for lunch.  The tostada omelette so big we can share.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"The age of the neon lights with a fireplace center sitting!  Awesome drinks in a fabulous atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I totally LOVE this place! The art deco flamingo lampshades gaudily clash with the mirror mosaic ceiling tiles, pink and purple neon lights and purple and turquoise seats (are they made of velour?!). There are fake trees and plants. The waitresses are dressed in brightly colored short dresses. What is not to love? The menu is varied with many breakfast or dinner choices. My southern fried steak was the best I can remember having. Ever. And I'm from TX. 

We went with friends for brunch on a Sunday. Call ahead for a table if you don't want to wait. I'm glad I did so. I would love to go there as a last call stop after a night out on the Strip...it's gotta be an interesting place in the wee small hours if it was interesting on a late Sunday morning. 

This is now going to be one of our this-is-Vegas spots for when people come to visit. 

Love it! :)"}
{"text":"We picked this place based on yelp reviews and we must say that yelp reviewers did not lie!  First off all the decor. This restaurant has a special kind of eighties vibe, with the neon, flamingos and cool seating. Our hostess couldn't crack a smile, but fortunatley she was the exeption of the evening. Our waitress Daisy was very friendly and patient, the menu had a wide selection of different kinds of food and the cocktails were reasonable priced. We ordered salads, steak, shrimps and burgers. All of the food was cooked perfectly and incredibly tasty. The portion were generous. On small thing bothered us, but apparently it's an european thing: once a plate was empty, it was taken away from the table even when other people were still eating. This is considered rude in western europe. All and all we enjoyed our evening very much and would definitly return if we would be in vegas!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, giant mugs of coffee. The decor alone is worth the trip. Breakfast was large, tasty and filling"}
{"text":"great spot for breakfast.  when you step inside, you'll be reminded youre in vegas!!!  i didnt see one, but it wouldnt surprise me if there's a velvet elvis hangin somewhere in the restaurant.

definitely am recommending it for a breakfast joint.  food and service were great."}
{"text":"Great food, large portions, efficient service. Ate breakfast with a group of 8 and had only a short wait. Food was good and coffee kept coming. Later ate dinner, still a short wait, food tasty, service even better."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Peppermill a number of times over the last 5 or 6 years. I usually arrive into Vegas on a later, after-work flight from the East coast. By the time I get checked in to my hotel and all cleaned up for the evening, many of the hotel dining options are closed or things are winding down. Thankfully, the Peppermill is open 24 hours with a full menu. It is a fantastic diner with a great menu, and soo much character. It's clean, the wait staff is friendly and top notch. Also, the late-night manager is friendly, always on her toes, and interested in hearing about the customer experience. She does a great job both supporting and orchestrating the service staff. 

I have ordered many entrees, both dinner and breakfast selections, some of which include the following:  Berry Spinach Salad, Crab Cakes, Omelettes, Chicken and Red Pepper Pasta, Swiss and Mushroom Burger, Creamy Chicken Dijon, Pesto Chicken Sandwich, Tomato Bisque, Chicken Noodle Soup. My favorite is the Creamy Chicken Dijon dinner. Two generous pieces of pounded chicken served on top of mashed potatoes with a vegetable, often green beans, and of course the creamy dijon sauce.  It is a large portion entree, as most of the dishes served are. I'm surprised there are not pictures of this entree in the photos section. The specialty drinks are excellent too. Cocktail waitresses in black gowns take your drink order which is prepared by the bartenders in the Fireside Lounge. I've ordered the Blue Hawaii a couple of times, and I have a friend that loves the Espresso Martini.

After dinner, I usually get a couple of drinks in the Fireside Lounge. You get certain drinks comp'd if you play the video casino games at the bar. However, I have to warn you, the games seem tighter than many of the machines I've played at different locations in Vegas. You may want to consider abstaining from play and just pay outright for your drinks. All in all, the lounge is a comfortable place to get a few drinks with friends after dinner.

I gave this restaurant a very high rating, taking into consideration it is an upscale diner, with its own unique signature ambiance."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat. Simple hamburger was very good, and affordable.  Service was much better than some say. Check out the rainbow sugar at your table.  Then, slink through the bar area:  The flaming lake is not to be missed.  Three stars for the food and service, plus one for atmosphere and people-watching; minus one for the hint of smoke in the air.  Go."}
{"text":"Iconic. Big meals, big drinks, great interior. The service was fast & friendly. Our food was good, slightly pricey (average for Vegas), & maybe a touch over cooked, but I still enjoyed the entire plate. I would come here again."}
{"text":"I loved Peppermill at one time; my birthday dinner here last night left a lot to be desired. 

Simply: Peppermill burger was overcooked...not the med-well I asked for. Sourdough was so hard & rough the roof of my mouth is tore up. Fries were \"okay.\"  Overall, it was a very dry burger-not the greasy mess I was looking forward to. My friend ordered a med-rare steak & eggs & THAT came out well-done. We were too hungry to send our food back and ate what we could. 

Our server was nice but never refilled our drinks let alone asked. Happy Hour is promoted on Facebook & their website, but NO menu. I had to pull it up online only to be told they didn't have the drinks listed. 

It wasn't the amazing experience I am used to having here. I was soo excited to come here for my birthday and I regret doing so. Fortunately the day was great nonetheless. 

And the \"free photo,\" isn't visible at all, just a gimmick to get you to buy one you can see. 

After eating at Peppermill for years, between LV and the former Fresno location...I seriously doubt I will return."}
{"text":"I've never sat down to eat here, but...

I can't think of any place I'd rather be at 3:30am on a Saturday after a seemingly endless night of reckless gaming and fierce alcohol consumption.  Keep 'em coming, bartender."}
{"text":"Food looks good but service is HORRIBLE!!! Do not come here if you have a big group! They will tell you a certain to expect to wait, which is normal to wait a little longer. And then when you check back after u have waited for the time they told you to wait, they will add on another 20 minutes??? Ok. So you wait and in the meanwhile you see about 5 more parties of three and four go in front of you. HORRIBLE!! And all they can say is \"its going to be a longer wait cause you have a big party\". Yeah no sh*t! But you've been waiting for the longest time while you are seeing others get seated. In my opinion not worth the wait. Avoid this place and go to Denny's which is right next to it. (Only if you have a big group) cause obviously you get seated quicker if you have about 3 people with you. =\"}
{"text":"What the hell? Why can't we have diners like this in the Bay Area? The food was actually GOOD. The best way to test the grossness factor in a restaurant is to order a side of fruit. Diners set a really low bar--as if being greasy and gross is a badge of honor. Imagine my surprise when my side of fruit came out not waterlogged and discolored, but fantastically prepared, fresh, colorful, and beautifully presented!! The strawberries tasted like they came out of a Beatles song. My main entree of country steak, eggs, and hash, was equally perfect. It's fucking cool inside here, as well. Retro neon signs and giant leafy plants decorate your 24 hour breakfast experience.

Tip: Meals are huge and expensive, so splitting is the way to go."}
{"text":"this is for the fireside lounge 
so my  boyfriend surprised me by taking me here so i could try a scorpion for the 1st time and it was what i expected it to be delicious but what would keep me from coming back was the service the bar tender gave us was awful. he was rude to my boyfriend for no reason we were polite and told him what we wanted and asked him before he made the drink if we could have it to-go he said yes so when we grabbed the drink he stopped us and said we couldn't take it out and had to pay for the glass did he not say it was fine for us to have it to-go before we paid for it so we ended up paying $24 for my one drink and he still expected a tip old man please your not getting shit 
would i go back maybe in a few years once the bartender is no longer there"}
{"text":"this is the spot to eat at 24 hours a day. their breakfast is the best on the strip!!"}
{"text":"This place is a Vegas icon.  Good food, service, atmosphere, and open whenever you get there.  If you're on or near the strip, the Peppermill is an awesome retreat."}
{"text":"Awesome old Vegas institution.  Great food, good service and huge portions. Love breakfast here free parking."}
{"text":"Big portions,  food is good.   Long waits be prepared."}
{"text":"Food was alright, large portions of eggs with whatever you get. They were out of corn beef hash by 1 pm? The eggs Benedict were B class. The San Francisco scramble was much better. Mostly I was turned off by the customer experience during my first and only trip there. We approached the counter where the hostess were hanging out, and were not greeted. I had to make awkward eye contact in order to get noticed. Lots of gossiping from the hostess and the overfilled entry made my boyfriend and I head to the bar. Drinks were made with no gusto, and none of the bartenders knew of any specials and referred me to the manager to figure that one out. Hello, it's Super Bowl Sunday on the strip, know your business better. Fast forward a half hour later, sitting down and were asked by waitress if we needed more time, and for the sake of time we ordered promptly. There were so many loud groups and fluorescent lighting I would not recommend for an intimate nor family setting. After our check was brought, I inquired whether I could pay with the waitress, she said okay and walked away. -__- If you're in the area I would try it on a not so busy day. If you're traveling more than 4 miles, avoid and head to a decent restaurant where even if it's busy, customer satisfaction will not be sacrificed."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when my boyfriend drove up to Peppermill but he assured me it was amazing food (my first trip to Vegas but he goes once a year). He was completely right!  The look when you walk in is what one thinks of when thinking about Vegas with neon everywhere, but the food was the best while there & we hit some nice places. The entire menu is available morning or night. I highly recommend their eggs Benedict but everything looked good & my boyfriend said he has never had a bad meal there.  It's on the strip but not in a casino which is a plus too. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Go there - large portions, fun older \"Vegas\" atmosphere.  The next time we visit Las Vegas, it's definitely on our food agenda."}
{"text":"Peppermill is as good as it gets when it comes to a casual dining place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Food is always fresh, waitstaff is always friendly, and the positions are great.  One of my favorite spots to visit in Las Vegas...."}
{"text":"You have got to try the Scorpion - it's their signature drink! Delicious, refreshing, and \"buzz-worthy\"."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast.  The firepit looks totally different in daytime.  Anyway, on to the eggs:  the biggest omelet I've ever seen.  And somehow they managed to make it taste delicious.  Great service.  Very affordable."}
{"text":"I can honestly tell you from intimate experience that this place is fantastic the food is delicious and the portions are huge I can guarantee you the general manager runs a spotless restaurant and if you'd like to have a drink they have a great cozy little bar and Denise and James are sure to take great care of you I recommend this place to all always a packed house here"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way home.  Plenty of parking.  The neon lights were cool.  I had a burger is was great & cooked as I asked with plenty of onion rings to share. My husband had the club sandwich they use top quality turkey, the fries were a little soggy.  Our server was nice.  The photographer who took pictures was nice not to bother us as we were eating our lunch. We will definitely be back when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and each time it seems like it gets better. Sure it's a great place to chill and relax by the fireplace to grab a drink and relax. But what keeps me coming back is the classic greasy american diner grub in a only in Vegas atmosphere! i.e. bright tacky florescent lighting, flamingos, and the familiar pink Vegas lighting glow! 

I usually stick with the classic diner grub, i.e. burgers, sandwiches, and egg dishes. Portions are decent, flavor is what you'd expect from this type of place. The Pastrami is very nicely done! The rings and fries are no joke either! Food is way better than a large portion of the 24/7 cafes in most of the casinos. 

The service is very friendly and professional! I usually ask what they would recommend, the responses have always been pretty good! At least the servers know which of  their food taste good!  

Drinks are served by ladies in an evening dress! With those coming out of the \"Fireplace\" bar! Usually a pretty funny scene with all the drunks coming in and out of the bar area!  Classic!

Eat, Drink, and be Merry!"}
{"text":"Great Place really great staff definitely worthy of having 5 stars. We had our Wedding Reception Here April 1st, and the Management was so helpful I recommend it to any one looking to have a reception or celebrate anything. Food is Good and Drinks are not terribly expensive like at the casinos. I am definitely going back when I go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Can't heap enough praise on this place. Let's just say perfect across the board, atmosphere, service, food and value. This place is extremely well run.  If you are in Vegas, don't skip this."}
{"text":"Great food at good prices. The portions are huge and the staff is very friendly. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Love the Ambiance,  Food was ok !! I think they need New Chef..Its like a Denny's... Defenitely can make more $$$ if menu's were change and make it more exciting... Like I said Place looks Great !!"}
{"text":"Went for a late breakfast as breakfast is served 24/7. Omelette is huge and can easily be split. Two of us still didn't eat the entire thing. Our table also had pancakes, French toast and the blt w/avocado. All very good. May be a little out of the way but worth the walk or cab fare."}
{"text":"A rough in the diamond, Located on the glitz and what was once glamour the  Peppermill has been around for some time but yet it has not lost any of its classic feel.  It's great for a casual get together with friends or somewhere to grab that late night meal on your way home.
They have a full menu with pretty much everything you could want and the specialty drinks are quite special indeed and will always draw attention.  I would always suggest this as a simple spot to stop and eat, or maybe crowd around the fireside lounge for some drinks and laughs."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time about 3 weeks ago. Read about the place and heard how good the food was so I was excited to try it. I can tell you without a doubt I was beyond satisfied. Simply put - the food was SO GOOD! It was crowded but the wait time to get a table was not bad. The portions of food were large and omg it was just so good. I wish there was one here in L.A.! You seriously have to try this place if you are in Vegas. Simply fantastic!"}
{"text":"This a must-visit place each time I am in Vegas...I heard this is one of the places locals frequent...Why stay in your hotel for breakfast?  You would get a great diner experience here!"}
{"text":"Nothing impressive about anything I've had here. No reason I would ever go back after being so disappointed in 2 visits. Blue berry hill or literally mcdonalds Is a better breakfast option."}
{"text":"This place is in another dimension.  24/7/365 it's clean. As a restaurant manager, that should be impossible.  Food served fast fresh and delish! Our favorite breakfast worldwide!"}
{"text":"Interesting decor, delicious mushroom and Swiss cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. It's somewhat overpriced for what it is. Service was fine; it didn't take too long to get cocktails or our food. 

It seems a bit overrated...maybe we'll try the Fireside Lounge part next time just for the atmosphere/drinks."}
{"text":"Everything a restaurant should be in Vegas. Food was awesome. And the most fun interior decorations, too. Bloody Mary was a bit watered down, but still tasty."}
{"text":"So many people had suggested the Peppermill, that I invited my out-of-town guests for lunch there. Ummm...decor is like The Rio and The Flamingo casinos upchucked--confusing...tropical, mod (neon 70's) and we expected Hugh Hefner to rise from the dead in the lounge with sunken fireplaces/curvy couches. The bar maid was dressed in a black 'moo moo', our waitress had black shorts and a tropical top, while other waitresses were dressed in mini dresses with suspenders (think Swiss Miss) with pigtails. Very kitschy
Forgot to mention the continual loud pages in the lounge--\"Baker, part of 2\", Jones, party of 8\"--annoying. 
The food wasn't anything you can't get at any cafe/diner on The Strip. Tourists--you can do better"}
{"text":"WE LOVED THIS PLACE! The little wife and I followed the great reviews for the Peppermill and we were totally satisfied. We ate breakfast here 4 days in a row, it was that good! Their omelets are so large that you can easily split one between two persons and they are very, very good!! My experienced estimate is that they contain around 12 eggs. The included sides of toast and hash browns will top you off with a smile. The hash browns were excellent!!  

I wish there was a Peppermill restaurant here in Sacramento!"}
{"text":"Met some drunk people on the strip yesterday who were raving about this place. Since we've all been drinking, we decided to go give it a shot. It was between Korean BBQ and this place and I was voted against. Good thing Cuz this place was awesome. The long line was a good indicator of how good things were to be. Our server Jaime was the bomb. Very attentive and ensured we left satisfied. Every plate we ordered was huge and tasted awesome. I'm not going to list the different items we got because u guys need to come check this place out and decide for yourself. Or you can ask Jaime like I did and she'll make sure you get something good to eat."}
{"text":"I have long loved the Peppermill. Since back in the late 70s, I visited the Peppermill in San Francisco and north bay. Love the Reno Peppermill, as well. 

This is the second time I have eaten at the Las Vegas Peppermill and as usual, the service, atmosphere is always fun and first rate..... however, I had breakfast of eggs and corned beef hash. The hash was canned, but very dry, as though it had been sitting under a sunlamp on a steam table that had run dry. The eggs, ordered over-easy, were burned and one yoke was almost hard boiled. The toast was very ordinary and was burned. For the price they charge (the same as the Venetian) I expect more, but Denny's a few doors away actually makes a better breakfast than this for half the price. I was very disappointed and won't be back for breakfast. Lunch will likely be fantastic, but this didn't make me happy. I think they need to look at their procedures and keep a better eye on things."}
{"text":"Great meal, great atmosphere, outstanding service, affordable and on the strip.  Portion was huge.  Old school ambience."}
{"text":"With its flashy neon on the outside and its pink neon on the inside, this place oozes cheese, old timer vibes, and memories of Vegas yesteryears.  Amazingly, I did not see the ghost of Liberace which I kept looking for in the corner of the room.  How I managed to avoid this landmark for my seven years in this town is beyond me.

This review is for the Fireside Lounge only.

The bar was surprisingly busy, filled with a loud bachelorette party, couples lost in each other's eyes, and....a prostitute?  Definitely an interesting crowd.  It's more of a date spot, so if you are looking to meet people (other than prostitutes) you may want to think twice before coming here.

The bartender looked irritated and wasn't friendly and I don't understand the long gowns they make the poor cocktail waitresses wear.  Drinks are a little overpriced considering this really isn't a part of the Strip where tourists hang out.  A beer and a vodka cranberry cost $13.

I have to mention that the floor was FILTHY.  It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in about two weeks.  Bleh.

The Fireside Lounge is a place that is trying to cling to its '70's heyday and I like it.  Vegas needs more old-school.  Now if only they can clean the floor and liven up the bartenders then I could see myself stopping by more often."}
{"text":"I went here and gambled for the first time ever.  Here is a lesson about gambling.  You start off betting 25 cents on video poker and you stick a dollar in the slot so you can play 4 times.  You always get dealt 15 or 16 which is super boring, what do you do?  Hit and probbaly bust or not hit and probably definitely lose?  Anyway at some point you'll realize that if you bet 50 cents you can win more if you actually win and get up to $3.50.  Then you get cocky and bet a dollar twice and your money is gone.

Anyway I liked the Fireside Lunge.  There is a fountain in there with a real fire coming out of the middle of the water, you can sit around it and watch the TV screens which are plentiful and playing football, basketball (hoops) and some music videos, good ones like 80s and Roy Orbison.  That puts you in a good mood.  The lights are really bright blue and red.  Neon, with reflective surfaces and free nuts.  I had an \"Amstel Light\" for $5.50 which was depressing, lost $2 gambling and left.  But no one bothered me and you could just waste a lot of time in there I think.  The bartender was REALLY NICE and there are all these fancy dressed up waitresses with their ass and titties hangin' out all over the place.  A good first stop.  Across the street you can get a souvenir  or go McDonalds or do \"indoor skydiving\" and for all of these reasons, overall I would recommend the Peppermill Restaurant, specifically the fireside lounge.  Make sure you are not wearing your gang colors or a ripped shirt though!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast. You can swap fresh fruit for the hash browns.  They serve very good turkey sausage and my wife and i easily split a 10 egg omelette with no additional fee.  The food tastes very good and is actually quite a value when sharing a meal."}
{"text":"Extremely rare to find an establishment like Peppermill, where you can actually have an (indoor-smoke) at the lounge while watching T V with a Beer or Wine and pretty decent food at reasonable price and 90% of the staff are GENUINELY nice."}
{"text":"First time coming by recommendation of a beautiful lady. Never even thought of the place because it looks like an old Dennys from the outside. 
Inside the place is pretty pimped out nice lounge area, chill atmosphere, top notch customer service! 
Had some drinks, appetizers all very well presented. 
Definitely returning"}
{"text":"Retro ambiance, friendly staff, delicious food. Keep in mind the food portion is ridiculously gigantic!"}
{"text":"LoveLoveLove this spot!!! Especially the Fireside lounge!! Great breakfast, lunch, dinner, appetizers Aaaaand drinks!*"}
{"text":"Open 24/7 - one of the most convenient places to eat by the strip. Love the atmosphere, food and service are great- mornings are packed so try to avoid!"}
{"text":"I asked for a table but the girls said \"tables are for bigger group\" and kept pushing for the bar counter, so I left."}
{"text":"The best service I've had in a long time!! I had breakfast at the Peppermill on March 14th, the day after my friend's wedding. We were a group of about 14 people. I was a waitress in my past life and I remember dreading big parties.

Our waitress (wish I remembered her name) was awesome! She was quick, efficient, and offered split checks... she was amazing! The food was good and the service was even better! I will definitely go back to the Peppermill the next time I am in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool! It is quite busy but I do think it's worth the 20-30 minute wait to get seated. I highly recommend sharing a plate, because the portions are just massive. 2-3 people could easily eat to complete fullness just from one of their omlettes. Staff is friendly but because they are so busy they are a bit neglectful, however that is understandable. Food is good!"}
{"text":"Dined here Saturday for lunch this place does not disappoint ever! Love it! We had bloody mary's which were delish! The food is always on point and the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"\"Because I want it twice in a 24 hour period....\" 

Peppermill is the all-around best restaurant that you can only Yelp dream about at night and still obcess about it during the day.  

I was introduced to Peppermill by my friend Jenny who is very particular about her food.  So, when she said she wanted to go to a 24-hour place that's so much better than Denny's, I mustered the excitement that I usually reserve for eating Del Taco (\"I guessssss, if there really is nothing elese....).  Upon arrival, you find that it was probably designed by a strip club interior designer:  Neon lights from ceiling to floor and under the tables, mirrored ceilings, sectioned off booths.  Yep, this is Vegas, baby!  

But, the food, oh the food!  I started with the \"waffle ambrosia\" which is a Paul-Bunyan sized waffle covered with fruit and whip cream.  The waffle has this ultra soft inside, crispy outside, and the cake batter is soooo good...The fruit ambosia is a complete cocktail of freshly cut fruit of strawberries, cantaloupe, melon, grapes, pineapple, and bananas.  And you can tell they just cut it right now...as in 5 seconds ago.  And, if you're not a waffle person, the pancakes are just as good.  

So, what else?  Because no person is full on just waffles (I can barely eat half)....

Bone-in Ham Steak:  Do you love ham?  Do you hate ham?  Who cares?  This ham steak is so thick and juicy that you wonder why anyone bothers to eat that sliced sandwich ham stuff.  Aesthetically pleasing too with grill marks.  

Nachos:  BIGGEST NACHOS ever!  Warm chips!  Big chunks of meat!  

Omelets: They use 10 eggs in every omelet and it's so fluffy and yummy... awww....

Ice Cream Sundae for $8:  I have no idea why anyone would want to order this.  Why does anyone order an $8 ice cream sundae?  Now I know.  It's like 3-4 servings of Baskin Robbins sundae...with two bananas and the best strawberry ice cream with real strawberry chunks.  There's chocolate and vanilla ice cream and good nuts and a boat load of whip cream. 

Honestly, every dish is like the perfect dream: the quality is super high, the food is super fresh, the portions are way too big for one person, and you'll eat food in a way that you wonder why there are even other restauants open.  After awhile, you don't know what to order because you crave the waffle ambrosia but you also want some ham-steak.  The last two times we were in Vegas, we had to have it twice a day...No food can really compare.  

And the best part?  A dinner for six with drinks is just a little under $100 with tax and tip.   

And strangely enough, every single waitress is really giddy and sincerely nice.  

(Peppermill, if you happen to read this which I know makes no sense because I'm assigning human qualities to a restaurant, then please open one in Sourthern California)."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was a few years ago. I had read that it was voted Vegas' \"Best  Make Out Bar,\" so on our honeymoon, the hubs and I decided to give it whirl. I had read somewhere that they were known for their pina coladas. We sat in the Fireside lounge side of the place. The ambience truly does lend itself to a great place to make out... Dark, with comfy couches, coffee tables and indoor fire pits, and waitresses that wear long black gowns with a slit up to the thigh. And the pina coladas were really good, too.
I couple years later, I was on a girls weekend, and we went to The Peppermill for breakfast. Huge portions, and nobody gives you the stink eye when you order a bloody mary with your omlet--it is Vegas, afterall. I had a veggie omlet, and it was awesome. Bloody marys were DELICIOUS, and I'm kinda picky about bloody marys."}
{"text":"Lets just say its an experience!  ;-)
The food was very good, and they have huge portions here.  The colors/theme and atmosphere is a must see, we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! It's open 24 hours and after a drive from Southern California was a welcomed treat. The vibe was very casual and low key.
My husband looked on yelp for a restaurant for us to go to late. Most hotel restaurants close at 10 or close to that. We were seated right away. We ordered a scorpion (6 shots are in this shareable drink) Our food arrived quickly. Portions were huge!!! We both ordered steaks. Amazing! 
We will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Diner type food, smoothe Technicolor interior. Excellent lounge in the back."}
{"text":"Walked in and couldn't believe the interior. Everyone says it's a must if your in Vegas so we went. I think that saying is just based on the weird interior. The food was solid but not out of this world. 24-hour availability also probably helps this place stay popular."}
{"text":"There was a mixed drink there that tasted like a damn banana split it was awesome and they have the most Exquisite chicken parmesan on the planet my husband taste in my plate and I told him get his own...lol.. the place was beautiful and the whole family enjoyed it so much for you ever get to the Vegas area again I'm definitely going back"}
{"text":"They are feeding dinosaurs here. The portions are larger than humongous. Seriously. And it's still tasty. I had an omelet and pancake for breakfast and was not hungry again until dinner time. My omelet had fresh ingredients and my husband enjoyed his omelet as well. Super service for us.  For the price and the amount it cannot be beat. Real diner food. Husband also had nachos and wings one night and raves about those as well."}
{"text":"We are locals excited to try a classic. What a disappointment. Absolutely horrible food & service. Ordered a $32 steak that I couldn't chew. Didn't see the waitress for 15 minutes to even try & return and order something else & then she got an attitude & sent the manager over whose attitude was no better & she didn't even bother to ask if I wanted to order anything else?! Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"This place sucks so bad when it comes to service for breakfast.  Had a waitress tell me she just started her shift and couldn't deal with me. Then has her manager wait on me to which they could not manage to cook the bacon.  Mean while watching the lazy waitress talk to everyone waiting tables including the manager. That was waiting on me not going back there. I got better service at Denney s."}
{"text":"Ok let me start by saying I am critical. There are too many places to eat. Not only is the food important so is the presentation and service.

That said Peppermill is a good value. I went for breakfast, service was good food was hot portions were generous.  I had corned beef hash with scrambled eggs. Nice presentation cucumber and tomato slices decorated plate. 

I would have given them 5 stars but I like my corned beef has crispy. This is a good alternative to the expensive restaurants at the Wynn and Encore. Short walk."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad...i used to come here A LOT when i was young & single..i mean back in the day this was really the \"place to be\"....also back then if you couldn't really think of a place to go on a date (you can only go to the movies so many times) and you really didn't want to frequent any nightclubs then this was the spot!i can remember one time when i just met this girl....she wanted me to meet her up at the peppermill..sure that's cool I said...anyway I arrive walked in and noticed that my date wasn't there yet..i thought ok no big deal..(this was way back when cellphones didn't exist) so i waited in their little lobby between the restaurant and the bar/fireplace/lounge with sofas)..& I'm waiting & waiting...ok at this point I'm thinking a crap i got stood up...i decided to wait just a little while longer ..i noticed that there were about 5 slot machines by the door..i really don't gamble but i was bored and was just trying to kill time...i popped a few quarters in & BAM!!! I hit 4 aces 5 hundred bucks!! I was stoked because as I said I didn't gamble really.. Coincidentally my date comes strolling in the door right after...so we went in the lounge area & had drinks & a little bite to eat...anyway now that I'm older & I'm a widower a friend of mine wanted me to go on a double date with him and his girlfriend's friend was going to be my date (kind of a blind date so to speak)..this was last weekend...they decided that they wanted to go here..i said ok what the hell I'm game..so we arrive went in & really didn't notice any changes...it looked pretty much the same..it brought back memories but again now that I'm older I'm like really? It was cool when we were younger but now not so much...food is ok drinks are strong..as i said in the beginning..this place isn't bad...if you're new to Vegas it's worth checking out..as for me though i probably won't be going back...."}
{"text":"Wow! This place has the worst service I've had in a long time. It took twenty minutes for the waitress to take our drink order, then another 15 to get the drinks. We were finally seated and it took another 15 minutes to take our order. Anyway you get the picture, we finally got out of there after about 2 1/2 hours. I will never go back to this strip club looking restaurant."}
{"text":"You had better be VERY hungry when you go to the restaurant.  We took a couple of people with us, they did not believe us, and there was WAY TOO MUCH good food that we took home.  In season, the Fruit bowl is so amazing..."}
{"text":"Food was good and they have a huge portions . Service was great as well . I come here often for breakfast, when in Vegad ."}
{"text":"Service is average and food is high priced go to omelette house instead for breakfast"}
{"text":"Really one of the best options on the Strip, huge portions, happy quick service and good solid quality!"}
{"text":"Great place to take a date. The fire in the bar is a great touch. Have the mai thai. Its quite wonderful"}
{"text":"If you want lots of food, relatively inexpensive with little flavor, this is your restaurant.  Everything from the eggs, hash browns, bacon and pancakes were cooked in the same grease (or lard).   Yuck, very greasy and tasteless.  With everyone's rave reviews we expected al lot better quality."}
{"text":"Every cabby we spoke to suggested The Peppermill, the food was awesome and our experience was something we will never forget! From the super awkward, host who seemed to be on something to the super adorable busser, David we had a blast even before our food came. I ordered the chicken fried steak which was great but too heavy to eat in 100 degree weather, and my friend ordered the sirloin with the garlic mushrooms. I thought she messed up for a minute, I would never ever order steak in a diner but it was amazing! Perfectly cooked and seasoned, I was green with
food envy. Then it got real interesting, an older couple was sat in the booth in front of us, and the gentlemen was dressed kinda like a thug. Aka thug nasty... was the highlight of our trip. A year later we still talk and laugh about him like we know him, if anyone does know him can you tell him I'm looking for him?! I just want him to be real with us."}
{"text":"Vegas Classic! A must go to when on Vegas and a staple for locals. Being from NY this place makes me feel like home. Staff is super friendly with great service. The decor is a classic diner feel and not too cramped. Food is delicious and plates are hearty. I have been here at all hours and loved it each time."}
{"text":"I seriously cannot figure out what all the hoopla is with this place! We decided to check it out and while I did like all the neon around the tables and the set up of the place, our waitress was annoying walking around with a stick up her butt like she was waiting to get discovered or something. I had the taco omelet and hubby had the chorizo and eggs. Neither dish was anything to 'oohhhh and ahhhh' about by any means. This spot for sure won't be on our return list. Ever."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for breakfast and I had their pesto burger which was delicious. The lounge was nice and dark with a fire pit. You won't know if it was day or night in there.  I definitely recommend going there any time of day since its open 24/7."}
{"text":"the food did take a long while and the waitress was very dull she clearly did not want to serve my family what so ever! I will not be recommending this place at all and I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I've never had a bad or small meal here! The service is always friendly! Do not make a trip to Vegas without eating at the Peppermill and don't come to the Peppermill without having a drink at the fireside lounge!!"}
{"text":"If you come to Vegas, you gotta come to this place for brunch after a long night out on the town.  It is just so goddamn cool, it is ridiculous.

This is a restaurant that looks like a strip club on the inside.  Neon pink and blue lights everywhere and a lounge that makes you feel like you are in the heart of Dirty Vegas.  Fireside Lounge looks absolutely incredible.  I will be back!

I had a simple breakfast platter which was extremely filling and the portions were generous.  Having a separate cocktail waitress come around and offer you alcohol at 10 am was interesting too.  Not bad at all.

I will be making it back here on future Vegas adventures.  No doubt."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst places in las Vegas. Poor service, crappy drinks and food that tastes like it was made day before yesterday. And best part of all....u get to pay before u get your food!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time the other night and it was really nice 80 ' s style diner with a retro 50 ' s flair. I had a half sandwich and salad for 10.95. A bit pricey but the server was really nice. The only male server. Peggy the GM was really nice and said hello and goodbye upon arriving and departure.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Get in early to avoid long lines. (By Vegas standards, 8:30 am is early)

The serving size is huge. So don't order too much food. I canceled one order at the last minute after they made it and they were gracious enough to cancel it."}
{"text":"The Eggs Bene were fantastic and the hash browns look nondescript until you taste them. Instead of being cut julienne style they are shave thin. OMG, nice and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The country style ham and eggs would feed any army. And to top it off you have full bar service."}
{"text":"I love the fireside lounge.  If there's an empty seat...grab it.  It is definately an experience.

And to top it off...gorgeous women with their pretty long hair and full-length black halter dress, with the slits that go up to their legs.  THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE.  If I wanna cozy up with my honey, this is our place.  Could it get anymore romantic than this?

And the food...we ordered the nachos, not expecting it to be towering over the plate.  

I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE."}
{"text":"I read the awesome reviews before going and I have to say wow,that was the worst foods I've ever had. Starting with the host who had now important things to do than to tend to the people who walked in. The peppermill sampler platter is nothing but deep fried food with no flavor unless you like the taste of grease. Their steak was cooked improperly, and again no flavor. I see the Zagat award and yelp recommendations and couldnt belive how they could possibl have them. The girl at the cashier asked, \"how was everything? \" and when i said not good, her response was \"oh\" and nothing else to say. I'll never go again."}
{"text":"From the out side it looks like an average dinner. But trust me this ain't your average dinner. It's a dim lit restaurant with neon lights.


My only concern is the size of the shrimp cocktail it was only five shrimp. Besides that the Swiss Burger was good."}
{"text":"Well worth it!

When we called to make reservations for our large group (10+) for lunch on Father's Day the receptionist let us know that even though they Didn't do reservations, you could still call ahead and get put on the waiting list before you arrived.

The wait was supposed to be 30 minutes, so we called ahead about 30 minutes before we were to arrive. But it took an Additional 30 minutes for them to ready our tables we we got there. Upon asking about the delay about 15 minutes in, they let us know that 1 table had been cleared but they were waiting on a second due to our group size. Understandable.

However, this wasn't wasted time since we all crowded into their beautiful Fireside Lounge for drinks.

What to choose?

After reading fellow Yelper reviews, I was focused on trying two things:
1. The Scorpion 2. The Chicken Fried Steak

The Scorpion was a massive reddish-orange-pink monster. It created an instant buzz: What the heck is that? Can I try that? The double-length foursome of straws were like something out of \"A Christmas Story.\" All I could hear repeated in the back of my head was \"You're gonna poke your eye out!\" Instant Photo Opportunity. Being Las Vegas we were able to transport it (slowly) from the Fireside Lounge to the Restaurant area for our meal.

Good sweet Mai Tai flavor. You couldn't taste the alcohol.

P.S. The server let us know that you can keep the Scorpion's cup (Known as a \"Fishbowl\") as a memento for an additional five dollars.

Time to do some eating!

Portions were very large. Great for sharing.

The Southern Chicken-Fried Steak was amazing. Well-breaded. So flavorful. Meaty. Crispy. The kind of food you add to your \"crave\" list. 5/5

The over-easy eggs were fluffy and delightful. 4/5

The hash browns were a disappointment. Kind of soft and mushy. Next time (and there will DEFINITELY be a next time) I will have to ask for them extra-crispy. 2/5

The \"Can I try a bite of that? Oooh Yum!\" List: Their Eggs Benedict 4/5 and also their Pancakes 4/5. I probably would have asked for more samples if I wasn't so happily focused on my Chicken-Fried Steak.

Kind of difficult to get a server since it was so crazy-busy for the holiday. Servers were very nice and attentive once you flagged one down.

This is now one of my must-eat Las Vegas destinations. Yum.

Sincerely, Michael"}
{"text":"Great old school las vegas place. Got a seat at the counter,  no problem.  The eggs Benedict was the best i ve ever had!  A must stop in LV!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is perfect here- seasoned good, great service, and awesome fireside water bar 24/7."}
{"text":"the nachos tasted pretty good defintely felt i got my moneys worth the staff was rather friendly"}
{"text":"Just because it's a legend, that doesn't mean it's still the best.  In fact, this place has dropped off my list of places to eat. Look at the area around the Peppermill. The Clarion was once the Debbie Reynolds, WWF, Paddle wheel casinos. Now,  it's rubble. Tacos Del gordo was THE PLACE for an arm-sized burrito and super fresh tacos. Now it's an empty store. Further proving that the SLS Is dead wrong by telling us that \"North is the new South \". (that's a truly a DUMB idea. As is the idea of the SLS itself.  Enjoy it now,  I say it's closed by '19) Next month another classic is done. The Riviera sadly closes.  The landscape changes again. Between the quality going down, prices going the other direction and the fact that some of the local residents of the 4-legged variety have been seen nearby.  I wouldn't send anyone to go there.  I used to LOVE the open hearth of the Fireside.  But I have to admit,  I'll never go again."}
{"text":"Cool place to grab breakfast or lunch. There are a lot of tourist who come here daily, so it is always crowded! The wait for a table isn't too bad. They have big portions, there is a big menu, so if you don't know what to choose you can always order a few different things and share with your group. I prefer breakfast at this place more than lunch. I have had their roast beef dip with onion rings, and it was just ok. But the breakfast is AWESOME. We had the french toast with tons of fresh berries and boysenberry syrup! Also the waffle with eggs, and bacon. I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything you want in a breakfast: large portions, quick service, and vintage Vegas decor.  Meals are so large only 2 of 7 of us finished our plates.  Special meals for kids. A little pricey but not when you get 2 meals due to the leftovers. Very good food. Im returning the next time I'm on Vegas"}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of my fiance's brother, and it was a good call.  It was a bit of a haul from Caesar's, but it was definitely an experience that was good.  The lounge is super unique and the food in the restaurant was good diner food. I'd definitely suggest giving this place a try, at least once."}
{"text":"Hey great food and not to expensive also wonderful decor. It's down the street from the Wynn well worth cheacking out."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I always love the food, but seriously the lack of service is ridiculous! I very rarely come here because of this reason..."}
{"text":"So I'm starting to question Yelp and how this place has a 4 star average rating. The outside of the place looks like a converted Denny's (hey, they even have a Denny's sign there.  The inside looks like an aged diner, but without good diner food.  The service was okay (although a little odd as we had to order our drinks from a different server than the food).

Overall the food was mediocre.  There was a lot of it (maybe that's what get's people to rate it higher).  However, you're in Vegas and I would have expected more from a 4 star place.  Honestly, hit a buffet at one of the better casinos and you'd enjoy the food there more."}
{"text":"I love going to this place. It is Retro FAB! The bloody marys in the fireside lounge  after a long night of drinking and gambling is  a must! I always have a tasty meal there. I think breakfast is best and there is a good selection to choose from. The lounge is brightly lit with pink and blue neon which does give off that Saturday night fever feeling. Tress surround the private booths and there is complimentary little glass bottles of peanuts. There is also large screen tv's that show music videos and live concerts of every genre of music. One minute your watching a black sabbeth performance and the next Frank Sinatra Crooning at the Sands. We always with a group of friends have cocktails in the lounge before hitting the strip.
Peppermill is now a Vegas tradition for my husband and myself. 
You must at least if in Vegas  have a drink in the lounge!. The meal prices are reasonable but it does always have a large crowd of people waiting for a seat."}
{"text":"Eehh not for me... We got here at about 3am late night Friday from Drais.- Hit the slots in the high limit for $486 on $1 spins with a $20 bill HA!! Anyway, we thought we were being cool coming to this place cause according to the bf some gangster movies were filmed here... 
Country Fried Steak and Mash - his plate looked like a frozen dinner - I didn't even ask for a bite. 
He didn't seem too enthused either but he ate about half. 

I couldn't find anything on the menu worth trying so I got 2 things that most places cant get wrong...Mozzarella sticks and wings. Well the mozzarella cheese was super thick and hard to chew and the buffalo wings had long feathers  they missed pulling were soaked in buffalo sauce... I ate 1 stick and 2 wings. Noticed the feathers and I decided I was done."}
{"text":"This long standing restaraunt never fails.  Every thing was cooked correctly from perfect eggs to crispy hash browns.  It has a booth for every table,just classic Vegas"}
{"text":"Whenever we visit Las Vegas we make it a point to eat at the Peppermill at least once.  Love the low celing with the neon interior, the horseshoe shapped booths, the fake(?) tree inside, breakfast 24 hours a day...  I've only ever ordered breakfast here - in the morning, afternoon and late at night - it always pleases me."}
{"text":"This place is now on my schedule of places to have breakfast in while I am in Vegas. I don't know how I had never wanted to try this place out.. This place is a must. Good food, big meals. And not too pricey."}
{"text":"In town for a convention and needed a non sports book place to watch a hockey game. Web and Yelp mentioned they had a comfortable bar so I decided to check it out.

My bartenders Denise and Ruth were wonderful. The place was very busy but my drink was always full, they delivered my snacks, and were even able to help me charge my phone!!

Since I was watching the game I stayed at the bar, but the lounge looks great and I will check it out next time I'm in town. There are comfortable booths and a great circular fire pit. The waitresses were also very friendly. 

The margaritas were good. Can't speak to the food because I only had chips and salsa, but the restaurant and waiting area were packed when I was leaving. Might not have the big chef name or be associated with a casino but it suited my needs perfectly."}
{"text":"Driving on the strip hungry at 9:30pm. Almost ALL dinner buffets were closing at 10pm. Saw the bright PEPPERMILL sign and checked the yelp ratings and decided to give it a try.

Upon entering the restaurant, the inside was so pink and purple, kinda like an old-school limo. I ordered the fruit fantasia waffles with the boysenberry syrup. It was huge!! & it was delicious!!! 

The portion sizes were huge, even the cup of coffee and the onion rings were stacked high. You get what you pay for. This is by far the best 24-hour restaurant on the strip in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"If you're visiting Las Vegas and you're looking for places to eat that are less expensive than hotel restaurants, definitely give The Peppermill a try.  Was there about 4 times on my last 2 week trip to Vegas.  The service is excellent, everyone is very friendly, the food is really good and the coffee is great!  But beware, the portion sizes are HUGE!  First time there, my boyfriend and I both ordered omelets and when they arrived we decided that next time we'd split one.  We sat at their counter one day around lunch time and watched what was coming out of the kitchen and couldn't get over the amount of food on each place.  Between the two of us, we've tried their soups, eggs, omelets, wraps, burgers, and steak and not one complaint.

The place has a 70s vibe that initially put me off when we walked in, but as soon as I sat down it started to grow on me.  It's a cute place and, most importantly, it's clean.

We will definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"There is so much character here, it's hard to focus!  There is one person seating you, another coming around for cocktails, a third for drinks and then there's your waitress.  What a system!  It's interesting to see it all.  We dined on New Year's day and while it was definitely crowded, we only had a few minute wait.  The food was delish!  My no-bread eating husband ate all of the toast and then mine. We ordered some omelets, which are made from 10 eggs by the way, and only ate about half of each although I wished I could eat more.  Overall, great vibe, great food and the prices weren't too bad either.  Worth the experience!"}
{"text":"graet place to hang out and drink the night away. they serve some of the best appetizers in the entire strip. the nachos are exellent and plentyfull.we almos had everything on the menu. are waitress was the best aswell. was very help in helping us what their specialtys were."}
{"text":"A must eat at restaurant when in Las Vegas. The wait can be up to 30 minutes, but it is worth it. They serve large portions and the food is hot and fresh. We have been there twice and have not been disappointed. I'm giving it 4 stars because the restaurant is very noisy. I would give it 5 stars if not for the noise. It would be nice if the back of the booths were higher to help with noise control. A cocktail waitress comes around for drink orders, which I have not had but they look delicious."}
{"text":"FOOD= Average
STAFF= Friendly and attentive 
PRICE= $$



Typical diner food with an old Vegas feel. This is where you go for that type of vibe and after a long night of partying, usually after the strip club you eat here. 

Chicken Fingers, good and served with fries.
Punch Bowl is delicious and will get two people who haven't eaten drunk."}
{"text":"This place is the most consistent  place to eat when I'm in Vegas. I know what I'm going to get and it will be satisfying. Bring your appetite because the portions are too big. Lol but the price is defiantly right. So come here!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, nasty food, horrible atmosphere. We came inside and there were a few people waiting. I was told it would be about a ten minute wait \"but probably shorter.\" After seeing many groups go ahead of us- including ones that arrived after us including a drunk loud mouth lady who said she had been waiting a while, cursed the host out, and got a table; I decided to find out what was going on. I looked at the list and saw my name up high with a bunch of crossed out names below mine. I was rudely told we had not been past over and would be next. 
I kept thinking \"everyone raves about this place. The food better be damned good because their service surely sucked.\" Unfortunately, it wasn't. I ordered buffalo wing appetizers and they looked like they came straight out of a Sysco bag and into the deep fryer. The taste reminded me of something they may have fed us in grade-school. 
My entrée was shrimp scampi; half a dozen or so over-cooked shrimp in some oily sauce. The saving grace was the rice pilaf. Yes, it also looked like it was boiled, or microwaved in a bag, but it was not bad. 
The atmosphere - remember the drunk lady?  Well we were at the table right next to her and every sentence was \"f this and f that, this persons an a-hole, f, f,f.....\" I would have said something but she was in a group of people including a large man wearing a \"Tap Out\" shirt who would have likely tied me into a pretzel and made me tap-out. 
To summarize: lousy service, pre-prepared food that you could make better yourself, and a loud terrible atmosphere. We will not be back and the people who raved about this place to me should have their head (and tastebuds) examined."}
{"text":"Not sure why people rave about this place. The \"vegas\" decor here resembles a dated strip joint. Food is a slight upgrade from Denny's. Being open 24hrs is The only reason why I'd go back to this place."}
{"text":"This was awesome!!!  Not only was the food good, but the service was too.  We ordered the Lorraine omelet with a blueberry muffin and biscuits & gravy.  Both were delicious!  The blueberry muffin was so good that we got some to go before our trip home.  Portions were definitely large."}
{"text":"Good for the ambiance at 3am after a night of clubbing, but the quality of food is not really there. I recommend the desserts, that are really amazing, espacially the strawberry short cake... you won't believe it ! A piece of art."}
{"text":"I recommend this spot! Food is delicious service is great dinning area is cute & the lounge are is cool! If your in the area stop by, it's next to the Riviera."}
{"text":"Large portions, great food, great place to people watch. The banana split is a wonderful treat to split. Love the color sugar on the tables. Very retro. This is the kind of place you can picture Elvis in a jumpsuit."}
{"text":"My wife and I really like this place. I've never eaten the food, but in the fireside lounge the drinks are stiff, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the ambiance is something that I haven't found anywhere else in Vegas. I'd highly recommend Peppermill for a pre-party or a nightcap. They filmed a few small parts of Casino there, and it feels like you're part of the movie."}
{"text":"The cab driver suggested we try this novelty restaurant while visiting. My husband had the club sandwich, I had the Mushroom Swiss Burger. We both had fries as our choice side item. The fries were a little soft, like double dipped almost. The main entrees were good. Although the mushrooms tasted like a can. Over all it was ok. The club sandwich was better than my burger! The portions sizes are huge!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill defies description.  Refined tackiness.  Utterly Craptastic.  Could it be that a Flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues?

All kidding aside, the best thing about this restaurant is the decor.  It screams cheesiness and vintage Vegas, with its faux neon lights and the veritable faux forest.  When was the last time you saw a deciduous tree in the middle of the desert?  I love the decor, and make sure that I always step into the lounge, open 24 hours a day, to see the fire and water fountain as well as the cocktail servers in the evening gowns split up to...here.

Now to the substance.  Peppermill is an institution.  It has been around seeming forever, and had a scene from \"Casino\" filmed there with Sharon Stone.

The food is average, at best.  It is also overpriced.  The place is best on its breakfast foods, in my humble opinion.  The omelets are huge, but again, overpriced.

The appetizer sampler platter is good, but overpriced.  Oddly enough, the onion rings on the appetizer platter are different than the onion rings as a side item.

I recommend this place for drinks in the lounge, and for breakfast on the weekends if you are staying on the Strip.  The place, while overpriced, is still cheaper than the buffet.  And more fun.

Are you noticing a trend here?  I will hit you over the head with it one more time...overpriced."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I heard so much good about this place before going to Vegas so we had to try it. We were happily IMPRESSED!
Great food, awesome service, fast, and the atmosphere was one of a kind.
We went here for breakfast and let me tell you, we were STUFFED by the time we left. They give very big portions of food. I got an omelette with hashbrowns and toast, he got country fried steak, with hashbrowns and toast as well. Neither of us could finish our meals. 
Our waitress was very quick and polite. The place was just fun to be at. They came and took our picture once we were finished eating and gave it to us as a souvenir (we liked that a lot). They also serve very big and delicious mimosas.
If you're in Vegas, TRY THIS PLACE! You will love it! :)"}
{"text":"HUGE portions. A family of four can share two entrees. Excellent customer service. A Vegas landmark since 1972 and a nice escape from the tourist-laden strip hotel buffets."}
{"text":"We went last night! Our server (pregnant young lady) was   Awesome!! Not sure I'll go back, food was mediocre, prices are way to damn high, $6.50 for a small salad?? There are so many places in Vegas no matter how famous they are that don't rape you on  food prices,  I mean come on people it's only decent food and your charging  high and prices. That was our 2nd and last visit."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. This is where we go to breakfast every morning when we're in town. The maserati omelet is the best. They serve a lot of food. My wife and I are able to split a plate and still full. The pancakes are worth a shot too."}
{"text":"Great food at any hour!  Classic Vegas decor!  Love their breakfast and appetizer options.  Check out the lounge too!"}
{"text":"Servers here were very nice! * Very \"welcoming\" * my first visit was back 2010 and came back yesterday, awesome food and great experience!"}
{"text":"Whenever I travel, I like to go to local hot-spots.  I loved this place!  We went for breakfast and arrived to find the restaurant quite full; always a good sign in my opinion.  We put our names on the list and waited in the lounge section.  It has an old Vegas vibe with posh leather sofas, swivel chairs, and fluorescent lighting.  Of course we had to order a cocktail while we waited for our table!  The drinks were pretty good.  But it's the food that steals the show.  Peppermill serves SUPER LARGE portions.  I had chorizo and eggs with a pancake on the side.  The pancake takes up the entire plate.  My friend ordered nachos, nachos, nachos.  It was easily enough to feed three people!  I hate to waste food, but there was no way to finish it all.  Next time I travel to Vegas, I will definitely be visiting this place again.  So, so good!!!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place, real big portions, but ordered off senior menu.  Great service, atmosphere, prices ok."}
{"text":"An old classic venue on the strip, which delivers the old vegas atmosphere along with food and drinks. 24/7 service will settle your needs whenever you want it, and they will bring it in great portions that you will have trouble finish. Cuisine is classic American which suits most ppl and cant go wrong here.

I really dont know why, but they have separate waiters handling food and drinks. It may be due to the fact that the drinks are handled from the connecting lounge area, but thats just a guess.

If you want a different dining option compared to the regular strip choices, go here to start it off or why not end it?"}
{"text":"This is a place I would never ever go to again! Parked in the parking lot right next to the restaurant and after horrible food and bad service, we came outside to find that our car had been towed illegally. Never go there! McDonalds is a step up from this place."}
{"text":"This place is so cheesy it's awesome. Food and drinks are great but can get pricey. The service is always top-notch."}
{"text":"Thought about giving a 4-Star rating but that just wouldn't be fair.  If it's Diner food that you're looking for, this is definately the place to go.  The Hamburgers have perfectly cooked Angus beef on a golden grilled bun. The fries have that impossible to find crunchy outside & tender inside, every single one of them.   The Pastrami is tender, juicy, and plentiful and served on buttery grilled rye bread.  Be sure to order the \"Scorpion\" drink for a whole new twist on \"Burger & Shake\".  I wasn't expecting the \"King of The Hill\" of Diners but after 20 years of trips to Vegas,  this  was a long overdue & fortuitous find."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience...Haven't been there in years, but the Fire place lounge, was the stage for some great beginnings, will get back soon!"}
{"text":"A las vegas must! Peppermill is lively, fun, HUGE portions delicious breakfast great drinks fun look, fair pricing will definitely stop by next time I'm in town. I personally prefer the breakfast menu. Staff is great, & easy parking!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Portions are a bit much though, too much for the average appetite. I have one regret about my choice of going there. I didn't go sooner. A couple at the next table ordered the ham with their breakfast, they gawked for about 2 minutes at the size of it. Made me laugh, but I highly recommend the Peppermill."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but it got a bit confusing with the check. We had a group of 20 and they said we couldn't split the check but they would do it at the register. Before we could split it there, they made us all line up to say what we had but still couldn't pay until everyone told them what they had to split it."}
{"text":"5 stars for food, 1 star for service

Pancakes were very good and great size

Waitress was awful, it took 45 minutes to get some pancakes while I watched 7 people who sat down after me get there's. Finally when I get I get them, she says I'll be right back forgot syrup, 10 min later comes back with syrup. She proceeds to check on every table around to see if everything is good while I just want the check. 20 minutes later I get the check, I'll come back for the food but prey for better service"}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, 5 stars for the ambiance, so 4 stars overall.  This place is retro, but in a good way.  Crazy colors and wait staff dressed in old school uniforms, it's definitely a place to check out at least once if you're in Vegas.  This place does an all day breakfast, and their portions are serious.  The ham steak is literally the size of a large dinner plate, and they grill it so that it gets some great flavor!  Their hash browns are great too, and they use real potatoes!  And I like that they use shredded potatoes that they griddle the heck out of, because I like my hash browns crispy.  And for those that want/need a drink in the morning, maybe to recover from the night before, they have a full bar from the lounge next door that you can order from.  Overall, fun place to go, whether for food, drinks, or just the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were ok. It feels like a weird old strip joint but it's ok if you're pretty chill about things like that. Service was ok, nothing bad or great."}
{"text":"I'm going to be very forgiving of some service issues because the food was just that good.  Our waitress seemed overwhelmed and got 3 aspects of our order messed up, but in the end it all got to our table and was phenomenal.  The omelets are the size of a half-football, which we noticed while being seated, so two of us split one (good choice) and still had some left over after stuffing ourselves.  We will absolutely go back next time we're in Vegas"}
{"text":"Huge portions. Decent food. After eating in their dining room one night, ordering take out the next night - I was told I couldn't order take out the following night b/c another customer ordered take out and didn't show up. That's like my business saying I had a customer who didn't pay an invoice once before, so I'm going to stop providing services to everybody now. You don't stay in business long with that mentality. 
As a side note - both times I was in there - it was 90% empty."}
{"text":"This is average diner food.  However the Peppermill is a Las Vegas institution to tourists and locals.  The decor reminds you of old Las Vegas.  This is a must for every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great service, best appetizers & fancy drinks. Open 24/7 and the firepit is amazing! This is Vegas, classic style."}
{"text":"Well what can I say..... Legendary place which is a  must go to place for food if you're hungry after clubbing.... Great pancakes!! Looking forward already to my next visit"}
{"text":"I hate wasting food, their portion is so much. I didn't even eat 1/3 of my plate. Why don't they cut the portion in half and charge only half the price? Or have a smaller portion or kids meal. People force themselves to eat because they paid for it. Visited per precious reviews but I won't go again!"}
{"text":"This place had over a hour wait and it is essentially just a dennys. You're better off going somewhere else.

Only positive was that the portions were huge. Still not worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Food is ok. This place is open 24/7 and has delivery, so that's a huge bonus. If you decide to eat there, service is ok. Prices are fair, portions are good."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from watching a show discussing Vegas & it's \"happening\" places.  Penn Jillette ( of Penn & Teller fame ( is a huge fan of this place.  So much so he has a booth & table ( I think he may of had it custom made ) in his personal kitchen.

It's a busy place...tourists, locals, celebs, EVERYONE!  It's on the strip, within walking distance from allot of the hotels etc.  Definately a must is you want to experience what I call \"an more upscale dive\"."}
{"text":"The service was good. The food was good and you get very large portions. I ordered the turkey burger which was the biggest one I've ever seen and the sweet potato fries that come with it were enough for 4 people. The price was decent for all that food."}
{"text":"We stopped by the Peppermill at 1 am to have a late meal! This place is always consistent and has a full menu for both breakfast and dinner items as well as outstanding service. We are not drinkers, but they have a full bar and lounge! Our server \"Dallas\" is awesome! Our order came out quickly and just the way we had requested, the burgers were cooked  perfectly! I highly recommend the Peppermill! Flavourful, well prepared and excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill Is Amazing The Breakfast Is The Bomb Large Portions And The Drinks Are So Good The New York Steak Is Bomb As Well If You Are Thinking About this Place Give It A Try"}
{"text":"I went here while staying in Vegas. My party had 11 people and they accommodated us quite well. We only waited 10 minutes or less to be seated. The decor is super fun: neon lights, bright colors, etc. It has personality, for sure! Most of my group came for the country fried steak. I had the steak and eggs--it was good! My steak was cooked a perfect medium, as requested. It came with three eggs cooked however you'd like, hash browns, and toast/muffin/etc.  We were checked on throughout the meal and got all we needed. I would come back!"}
{"text":"This is a throw-back for sure; but you couldn't ask for a better place just to hang out and chill.

I have enjoyed this place both times I have been now including most recently when I was there solo.

The bartenders are efficient and friendly as is the wait staff.  The drinks are well made and the food (I had the chicken quesadillas on my recent visit.) is  really good.

The fire pit at Fireside is pretty cool as are the comfy, curved bench/couch seating (with pillows).  It's a place you can really kick back and enjoy your evening.  You can just kick back relax, chill, and bask in the neon glow that is Fireside.

It is certainly a favorite stand-by to drop in every time I come into town now."}
{"text":"Real american restaurant with dressed up waitresses. 
The lady that advised the wine was classy.
The waitress  also gave good recommendation.
But the food was terrible.
Greasy, fries served cold, too much sauce on everything. 
Definitely a place that Europeans should avoid."}
{"text":"The Peppermill has been, for many of us Vegas locals, a decade's-long favorite.  Great food ... and can't begin to tell the stories of how many of us have fallen in love in the lounge!

Sadly (for us locals) it's become over-ridden with tourists.  

SUMMARY: 1) I wish they would open a Peppermill somewhere in Vegas off the Strip only for locals and 2) GO THERE!"}
{"text":"hostess received us like we were begging for food the server was just distracted as the hostess the food was  good  it was a bit over price i expected something better but not my experience with the service was really bad but the place is pretty nice"}
{"text":"Omg! This place is a joke. The service sucks and very damn slow. We came here and it's not even busy and yet the service is very slow. 
The food is not even good. It's kinda pricey too. I don't know why some of the review here thins that it's affordable. Ppl must be drunk when they wrote the reviews.
the only good thing in this place is actually there's nothing. The parking lot sucks and it's just overall not a good place to eat. Even though it's 24hrs I rather eat somewhere."}
{"text":"Been going here for 20 years.  Breakfast is amazing and late night crab cakes by the fire !"}
{"text":"The ambiance sells this place. Old school Vegas lives here. Reason enough to visit.

The lounge is a great place. Sit around the fire in water and enjoy the blue neon glow. Wait staff varies. I have been to this place many time spanning 2 decades. I love the joint but the waitresses are hit and miss. Often a miss. My recent visit she was pretty slow both speed and on the uptake. Bartender is good though and again, the place is just cool to visit. 

Restaurant side is also a visual splendor. Food is \"OK\". Edible but you are not going to leave saying \"wow great food\". Unless all you care about is portion which 90% of the tourists seem to fall into (large eating large). 

I would tell anyone to visit both restaurant and lounge side for an experience the rest of Vegas has lost. Great date spot.

For movie buffs the scene in Casino were Sam and Ginger are sitting having a drink and she returns to be asked \"any change\" ... that's the Peppermill lounge."}
{"text":"A great tool to have handy if you tend to run a 24 hr schedule while in Vegas, this place is a magnet for locals as well as tourists and convention goers.  That being said, if you want to get a group in there at a specific time, be sure to get a reservation in advance.  There's plenty of counter \"diner style\" seating if you're on your own or a couple, though, so walking in might work.  I've eaten here so many I times  over the years I've lost count :)

Great to be able to get breakfast all day!  Nothing like getti g up at 5 PM after a long night on the craps tables and being able to get your pancakes and eggs.

Large.... nay, gigantic, portions on many items.  Nachoes are at least 4 people, fruit plate is easily big enough for 3-4, etc.  Hefty burgers, big bowls of soup and generous portions of fish on the fish and chips (watch this dish, if the grease is a little old in the fryer it might not be the best).  Definately a handy spot even if it IS on the far end of the strip."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about this place. Great Vegas ambiance. Prices were kinda high ($9.50 for oatmeal) but portions are huge!  24hr menu has something for everyone. Staff was very attentive. Excellent coffee."}
{"text":"5 stars for consistently providing: great food, fast, friendly service, & uniquely beautiful atmosphere/ambiance. without a doubt, this peppermill is one of my favorite corners of not only vegas, but the world. in my opinion, peppermill/fireside is a must-see in vegas for locals & tourists alike. it's pretty, it's soooo, sooooo pretty!!!"}
{"text":"If there's a better place to eat in Vegas, please let me know. Excellent flavor, portions enough for two and open Kitchen. If you don't visit Peppermill you screwing yourself!?"}
{"text":"Awesome place real convenient for me since I work at Circus Circus
The service is on point and the food is priced decently being on the strip the portions are usually huge depending on what you order and environment is always energetic and soothing"}
{"text":"Maybe my standards are just too high, as when I go into a restaurant & order simple food I expect to get simple food. Nothing extra & disgusting. This place is a must if you like things in your food, like used sweetener packets from what I assume was a dirty plate. The manager attempted to say sorry but just made it worst. Although our server lacked the experience to rectify the problem, she tried to take care of it. They get one star and not a negative five because our server, Cheyenne, was a trooper, she tried to stay positive & smiley. The manager, only after reading my horrible comment card, came back over & tried to attempt to actually hear us the second go round. Whatever won't be back!!! I'd rather cook & btw I hate cooking!!!"}
{"text":"A excellent medium cooked burger, with pastrami and super delicious O rings. 

24 hours of eating

Free souvenir picture 

And firepit lounge in the back....strong drinks"}
{"text":"Good food(huge portions) with decent service, but expect a long wait during breakfast/lunch hours."}
{"text":"Came with a family of seven at about 2 am and everyone got something different. Pretty much everything was solid especially the pastrami sandwich and waffles. The coffee was huge! Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  Ordered the banana split for dessert and it was the size of a small sailboat!!! Highly recomend if u are looking for a comforting meal and a good value."}
{"text":"The food is ok...but the service sucks,you have to keep asking for refills and the only give you 2 napkins when my mom,dad and me were in a booth.But if you want a Better service I recommend sizzler it keeps up with your refills and it's cheap and very satisfying."}
{"text":"Food is very good, however all meals I've has so far are Huge and can easily be shared or you'll feed like you are just lugging food home. The Service has always been good while Parking can be challenging - Don't risk being towed, if the lot is Full - Park at Circus Circus and walk or go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Breakfast is really good here. I ordered the French toast breakfast, husband ordered corn beef and loved it. Overall good service, very attentive"}
{"text":"You better go there with an extremely huge appetite,  food is awesome, very attentive staff, I will hit it again when in Vegas"}
{"text":"I always seem to end up here after a night of hard drinking on the strip, which isn't very often. The portions are insanely huge but I always manage to make a dent during those early morning visits. 

The staff is always friendly and I LOVE the old school ambience."}
{"text":"Las Vegas Tradition - love it   Food, atmosphere, staff - always great!!"}
{"text":"Service gets worse everytime I come here . 30 min before our order was taken
Done eating here..."}
{"text":"The food was sub-par, but the portions were enormous. Don't expect too much and you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Just heads up. This place looks like it will be closed for a good portion of September."}
{"text":"Nice 24hr place to eat on the vegas strip. I got the philly cheese steak. It was really good. They give you a large amount of fries here."}
{"text":"A Vegas classic, and If you have never had breakfast at the Peppermill, make this a must stop for your trip. Come hungry as the portions a quite large. You might incur a wait time since this is a very popular place. Luckily, the Fireside bar is located on premises to enjoy their famous Bloody Mary. We enjoyed a delicious Belgian waffle and a Denver omelet, but don't think you could go wrong with any of the option on the menu."}
{"text":"Oh! When I am sitting at home in New England, the Peppermill is what I dream of. Here's the deal.....the food is straight up Denny's. Only there is a TON of it. But who cares....toast your toes 'round the awesome water feature/gas jet in the Fireside Lounge. Order a giant Blue Hawaiian and admire the server's slinky, thigh-high slit evening gown. Zone out on the weird music videos on the little TV's.  Be hilarious and put three straws together to sip on someone's wacky drink across the way. And lighten up. This place is the last of a dying breed. The world today needs way more fake trees, mirrors, and awesome neon lighting."}
{"text":"It is Denny's except it is double the price, has better coffee, and a larger menu; but, Denny's at least knows how to make hash browns. At Peppermill the hash browns may as well be newspaper shreddings. The entire table's resounding opinion was that the food was collectively mediocre. It was actually overwhelmingly mediocre. In fact, it reached new heights of mediocrity never before known by man. It's almost worth exactly one and only one visit just to witness this feat, but then again you could just go to Denny's and have better hash browns. The all-female cast of waitresses were lovely, friendly, and patient--even beneath the sad fact that they were just as much a part of the diner's decor as the array of indoor plants. I'd never specifically choose to go back to this diner, but it also didn't make me violently ill, so eh.
Update: I had to return to add that 3 out of the 6 of the party I went to this diner with ended up with mild food poisoning. I guess that shifts the balance from \"mediocre\" to \"dine if you dare\"."}
{"text":"This place is a really cool place to eat at. The seats are comfy, lights are cool, and fake trees and bushes inside. Our waiter Sarah B. was super nice and wasn't rude at all!

Pros:
Nice Staff
Comfy Seats
Cool Lights

Cons:
None"}
{"text":"This place is just awesome! I love a vintage type diner. I had the Western fruit plate and it hit the spot after eating out all week. Fireside lounge looked awesome too. You have to go here if your in Vegas. Of course they have huge portions, great food and prices."}
{"text":"Great late night spot for breakfast. The bar area looks like a pimps house...haha. Maybe this was my true taste of old Vegas. O yea, dont ask the person taking pictures at this place any favors like taking a picture with your camera instead of his so you dont have to pay....just ask the waiter."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Huge portions.  A recommendation from the locals which is always good.  Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had the thanks giving dinner. It was one of the worst dinners I have ever eaten. It looked and tasted like a pre cooked frozen super market meal - but for 24$. 
The service was good though."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place! Huge portions so I always share.. Great staff and I love the complimentary photo.. The food is always yummy, consistent all the time! #yum"}
{"text":"You wait an hour for mediocre diner food when there's dozens of other places that are better and closer. They're coasting on their glory days, definitely skip this place."}
{"text":"I came here after finding it on quite a few 'places to eat breakfast in Vegas' lists. Upon arrival it turns out quite a few other people have been reading the same lists.  At about 11am there was a 20-minute or so wait. 

To pass the time I waited in the bar area by one of their fire pits! The place has some crazy décor, with neon lights and fake trees everywhere. It feels like you are in some 80s club. 

Once seated I ordered pancakes and yes they were huge, there were a lot of them and they tasted good!! 

The place is open 24 hours and has a great menu selection! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Dude. 

I love the Peppermill. Where else can you roll in with your drunken gaggle of friends or \"friends-you-just-met\" at 4 in the morning and receive yummy plates of food in a relatively decent amount of time, before your eyes blur and you pass out in your food? The waitresses are chatty and nice, and have big hair with names like martha and chainsmoke outside....so friendly and lovely! 

A great place for late night /early morning food and also a great place to people watch...on the night/morning I was here we spotted some basketball players from the Warriors ...  I didn't know who they were until my friends told me...but not after one of the players poked me on my shoulder while walking past and i just screamed WHO IS THAT!? IS HE FAMOUUUUUUSSSS!?  

Good times I tell you, good times. 

Yumdizzle bacon and eggs, just enough grease to line my stomach while I pass out on my friend's shoulder while the sun rises over the fine land of Vegas....

Classic. Just classic. :)"}
{"text":"What a great place!   Eclectic atmosphere fun, friendly staff.  Prompt food service on the restaurant side. (Fireside lounge is separate). Coffee, 6 triangles of French Toast topped with banana, strawberry, melon, honeydew served with blueberry syrup. Fresh made mimosa and water for around. 30 bucks. Jennie did a fantastic job!  Wish I discovered it sooner.   **you get refills on coffee.  Be prepared for them to take your cup, not bring coffee to you.   And they will take your plate to box your leftovers.     Props to Jennie she filled my water bottle too."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never ate here! So good! The Cobb salad was amazing! Hubby had an omelet and was very satisfied! You will def. be leaving with to-go boxes!"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas again on business, left me staying at the Hilton on the North end of the strip across from Circus X2. What I didn't foresee was a Hilton, on the strip, with NO bar and NO restaurant. No problem, the Peppermill is just down the street. 

My coworker and I drive there to find a mostly empty parking lot, which made us think the place may be low on the popularity scale. However, in Vegas a lot if people walk the strip and inside, the place was full. 

I ordered the chicken and red pepper pasta. This dish was recommended by two employees.   I found this dish to be very run-of-the-mill.  

The cream cheese stuffed chicken was not outstanding. The cream cheese adversely affected the consistency and \"bite\" of the chicken while I found the red pepper cream sauce to be rather one-dimensional. 

The bruschetta appetizer and mixed drinks were very good. 

The service was very good and kind of made up for the rather average food offering.

Pros: good service, unusual decor and setting, made up for entrée.

Cons: entree a little sub-par"}
{"text":"My sisters and I were floored by the drinks...THEY HAD ALCOHOL IN THEM.  But, what was the best was the free pic Ashley took of us, she was really patient and it's not easy taking a pic if 4 drunk sisters. I recommend this to any group who wants to have a good time."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Peppermill for breakfast. It was an excellent experience. We both got the Peppermill Pancake Combo which was 3 eggs, 3 huge pancakes, bacon and sausage. 

We arrived at around 8:30am on a Thursday and were immediately seated. Our waitress showed up within 30 seconds and took our drink orders. When she returned with our drinks we ordered our food and it was at our table within 10 minutes. 

The food was so very good, the coffee and the service were both excellent. We will definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"My fiance' & I love coming in here when were in Vegas on our last day here for breakfast before we make our 4 hour long drive back home to Cali. There's always a wait but definitely worth it.. I've never tried any of their food except for breakfast, but they give you big portions and it's so good. Definitely a place to check out when you're at Vegas."}
{"text":"I never visit Vegas without coming here to drink in their waiting lounge and eat the peanuts in a baby jar on the table! I usually order biscuits and gravy and of course cocktails with breakfast because it's VEGAS!  The Peppermill is my legendary spot to eat and I will go out of my way to eat here. I don't mind the wait because I go into the back lounge and drink until my table is ready.  ((HUGS)) to my fav place to eat."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.. Great service and food. Nothing much else needs to be said. This is 1 of the best restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food for a fair price. I had the BBQ and onion ring burger, which was solid. The fries weren't all that good. Service was fine, got refills quickly and efficiently."}
{"text":"Great place for food.  For the price you get your money worth with their generous portions."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place so I was excited to check it out. The fire side lounge was amazing inside! Perfectly cheesy decor with a vintage feel. The atmosphere would have been perfect except for TV screens everywhere!! The mirrors on the walls reflected the screens so you literally could not escape them! We tried to find one booth without a screen in front of our faces but no luck, so we ended up moving to the restaurant. I understand that some people like to go out and watch the game but people also like to go out to socialize face to face without the distraction of moving pictures everywhere. If they just turned off half the TVs and played some cool tropical vintage music (or any kind of music really) instead of blasting the TV announcer, they could create a really awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"A Vegas classic still going strong. Form the good food at reasonable prices and the ambiance. Makes you feel like your in the past. This is a must try place if your looking for a little bit of old Vegas in a new Vegas time."}
{"text":"This is the place you need to go to if you want value for money. The prices are reasonable and not high like some restaurants on the strip.

Decent place to eat.

Be careful with over ordering here. The portions are huge. I eat a lot in one sitting and the restaurants on the strip don't do me justice but I was overwhelmed with just the size of the appetizers itself.  I shared most dishes with the wife

Totally worth the money and be prepared to take left overs back.

Ambiance has neon lighting and after a while you get used to it and it's fun."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is old school Vegas.  The food and drinks are tasty and the atmosphere is fab!  You must get a drink in the bar and you'll feel like it's Vegas in the 60's...don't miss it!"}
{"text":"So happy we found this place!  It's on the north end of the strip just south of the Riviera.  Cool decor with mirrors and neon.  The portion were GIGANTIC.  Totally enough to share one dish with two people.  I had the Mediterranean Omelet it's absolutely loaded with seafood ($13.50).  Service was very quick and friendly.  Bloody Mary was kind of bland and uninteresting but the food totally makes up for it.   I will definitely be back.  Thanks for the great meal!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Fabulous meal. My server Sophia was adorable. I had the Chicken parmesan and it was superb. The portions are enormous. Make sure you bring your appetite with you. The staff is super friendly him a cocktail waitress is always there to make sure you drink is not empty. I only wish I had save room for dessert because it looks scrumptious."}
{"text":"Great food, best coffee! Does anyone know what kind they use?
Food portion's are HUGE and price is fair for Vegas, split a meal if you can! You have to go!"}
{"text":"The omelet I ordered had 12 eggs in it. It was huge! The place is full of color glitz and glam. Huge bar with a fire pit and lush carpeting and drapery. This place is fun exciting brilliant and very delicious tasting. I absolutely loved the atmosphere and I would recommend this place to any beauty that wants fun food. It's a  hangover's dream. 
Full bar and hot wait staff. Pink electricity. The lights throughout glowed as I ate. Fast pace food finders dream. Love the DINNER. amazing, UPSCALE VEGAS FEEL."}
{"text":"My friends and I ended up here because it was close to the Wynn. However, when we asked a hotel employee for directions we were informed we made a \"extremely good choice\". And she was right. We arrived at 2am with the place packed. The food was quick and absolutely delicious. I wish I could eat there every day. The menu also had a HUGE variety of things so everyone was satisfied. It also had a cocktail waitress then deliver to your table."}
{"text":"Great BLTA!!!!!
And ask for BBQ sauce for your fries... It is better than catsup!! 
Overall a FUN Vegas Spot!"}
{"text":"Everything \"old school\" Vegas is here. the atmosphere. the food, the lights inside... even what the waitresses wear. their colored sugar is cool. Huge portions of food and 24 hour cocktails. cant ask for anything more awesome. Definitely a place id go to again, any time of the day or night. !"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love the Peppermill!! It's a Vegas staple. You have to come here at least one late night in Vegas! Huge portions!"}
{"text":"My expectation were high based on the rating. Unfortunately, in my opinion the food came up short. I had the pancake combo, with sunny side eggs. The pancakes were not fluffy, but dense, and the eggs were under cooked. Nice place, but the food was weak."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I will go here when friends are in town, for some reason they wanna go to The Peppermill, for the kitsch factor I suppose. Every time I eat here, my stomach doesn't settle well. I've never had the same thing twice because I hope \"Maybe blahblahblah won't make me feel gross later\". Nope. The last time we went was a Saturday night, but there wasn't a wait and many tables were empty, so they weren't slammed. It took over half an hour to get our simple orders of a club sandwich, burger and omelette. The iced tea was stale. The burger was cold, sent back to be put under the heat lamps, but they made a new one, so my starving bf wasn't thrilled. Then the waitress brought the new burger with a small smattering of fries. She said she'd bring more because that's all they had. My bf said \"Well, I ordered onion rings anyway...\" She never brought more fries or onion rings. This debacle reminded me of another time I ate there and my burger was frigid, like it was just pulled out of a fridge. Considering the prices for food that isn't that great, it always makes my stomach yucky and this last experience, we won't be going back. Small diners that care about repeat business and quality food will be getting our money."}
{"text":"Found this place late at night.  Food was good but a bit pricey.  Wish we had known two people could easily split one dinner and still have left overs (and I'm not a small guy).  Kind of like a denny's but totally cheezy vegas neon everywhere.  The bar was cool too."}
{"text":"okay so someone recommended this restaurant. I realized that it's only in business because they take advantage of the drunk bafoons that crawl in there at 5 in the morning, settling for anything at that point, to satisfy their cravings. they use they're huge portions to try to compensate for the ridiculous ingredients they provide. just don't ever taste the nachos; we have yet to discover what cheese they used."}
{"text":"Went out of our way to eat breakfast here because we had eaten at a Cracker Barrel in Phoenix and we loved it. This was not the same experience. The meal took unbelievably long to come our eggs were over cooked and greasy. We asked them to leave off the grits but they brought them anyway. The gravy for the biscuits was cold and not very good. The only thing that was excellent was the bacon. Very lean an mostly cooked enough. I will not ask my husband to bring me back."}
{"text":"This place was great, from the couches to the sunken fire place. We spent a couple fo hours in there before we knew it."}
{"text":"Great old school kind of food. Something for eveyone. Love this place. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here to Vegas on a Friday night starving so decided to try this place. Damn the food portion is HUGE!! I couldn't finish my whole plate, I ordered baby pork ribs, it had a lot of meat :3 nommmm. I also ordered the Mai tai cocktail. Fuhhhhh the bartender did add shitload of gray goose in that drink! Homies right there lol! I was reluctant to drink further after drinking half of it. Yikes! My Fds and I came up with a nickname for this place \"FFF\" Friday food f* cuz we got so full! So awesome this place is magnificent"}
{"text":"They serve huge portions here. Very busy restaurant but they know how to handle a crowd and get people through quickly. But be ready to wait, especially on weekends. The menu is pages and pages. But if you don't want a Flintstone size meal, go the the end of the menu and find the seniors/kids menu. I was able to order a decent breakfast that was delicious and priced low and was a normal size meal."}
{"text":"Go here. Have breakfast here. Have late night cocktails here. Just go and enjoy!

Positive - Great breakfast! Try the pancakes! Big portions. This place has one of the best and the most chill atmospheres in Las Vegas. Great lounge in back for relaxing and having cocktails with friends!

Negative - Very busy on the weekends for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast twice over the weekend! As once was not good enough! Only had their omelette and whoa they are made with 10 eggs! My husband wanted to know if they had a chicken coop in the back! LOL!! Two people should split an omelette and u may still have leftovers! Oh and their blueberry muffin Is divine! Everything was Delishhhhh! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, huge portions and rad decor. The biscuits and gravy were super yummy. It's right on the strip and definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Lovely diner to have breakfast! Totally feels like you're back in the 70's in the rural US. The food was delicious and not too pricy.

Careful, when we went at around noon on the Monday before New Years, and it was absolutely packed. Thankfully the booths are first come, first serve. So if you're only a couple, you will not have to wait over 1 hour to get seated into the booths.

Will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible nachos.. large portion..didn't matter..took a couple no bites and left the rest for the dumpster divers"}
{"text":"This place has a great breakfast menu! We had the eggs benedict. They also have amazing bloody mary drinks. You need to try their coffee. Great service!"}
{"text":"the food is surprisingly delicious! not your typical diner like dennys or cocos

huge portions. flavorful. friendly staff. clean environment.

pina coloda was delicious! drinks are decently price as well as the food. you won't feel ripped off. 

gotta love the old school vegas with neon lights.

i will be back!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast was definitely worth an hour wait. The omelettes and pancakes are huge and delicious. Really recommend the strawberry shake."}
{"text":"No, not so good as everybody says

We got to Wait for 20 minutes before seated. 

A little a bit expensive 

Not fresch vegs. Frosen then boiled"}
{"text":"It wasn't what I remembered when I last came here. The food was mediocre and the service wasn't great. It took awhile for my husband and I to get our food, considering the fact that there were 4 chefs in the kitchen. On top of that, they forgot one if our side orders. 

I was a bit disappointed this time around, and in pretty sure my husband washed his hands with the place. Too bad..."}
{"text":"Was hesitant when I first walked in with the flamboyant decor and the questionable reviews.... however I was so surprised how wonderful the food was. 

I visited the establishment around 1130am on a Saturday. Service was good, food came out in a reasonable fashion - portions were huge!

Definitely a must try in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and very old-school Vegas, Frank Sinatra,Dean Martin style the ambience is amazing. I like the drinks and food everything about this place, this is the real Las Vegas, not the planet Hollywood style but the essence of the old Vegas is right here."}
{"text":"Great find everything else was closed so we decided to do a littler forth of July dinner  great service by Alfonso"}
{"text":"Awesome decor. This place puts Mel's Diner back home in LA to shame. But bring a sweater -- they had the AC ridiculously cold in there! All in all a great experience, though, and I will be back and recommend this place to others. Loved the atmosphere and the food was pretty good...with lots leftover to take back to the hotel with us!"}
{"text":"We came for breakfast and ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. I have to say that it was amazing, will be returning again tomorrow."}
{"text":"We were in town for a bachelorette party. The maid of honor made a reservation two months in advance for 16 girls. When we get  to he restaurant they said they said they only knew it was for 10 on top of them not having a table ready when we walked in. Instead of being apologetic they argued why it wasn't ready. It was terrible experience and it ruined our dining for the bride."}
{"text":"This my first time here. I had the seafood omlet and it was amazing! Lots of food for your buck. I couldn't eat it all!"}
{"text":"Fro to-the mage.  Crazy neon lights, mirrored ceilings, this place must have been a strip joint before becoming a restaurant!  

But the food!  Huge portions, well made diner style food for decent prices $10-15 for breakfast.  It's open 24 hours a day, and it was walking distance from our hotel at the Hilton Grand Vacations."}
{"text":"This quirky diner is perfect for a casual dinner with anyone if you are looking for huge portions of good food for a good price. Went with some friends on a Saturday night for dinner and even though they were very busy we didn't have a wait and the staff was nothing but friendly and fast. 

Since most of the food is diner \"Americana\" and they serve breakfast all day the meal came out quickly (15 mins). I indulged in some massive pancakes and my friends had big salads, sandwiches and pasta. Everything was delicious and for two it was about $28 w/sodas.

The design inside is hard to explain other than quirky and colorful and they have a massive menu (think Cheesecake Factory) so in general there is plenty to choose for everyone. I highly recommend this as a cheaper alternative to the expensive restaurants on the strip and will be visiting again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love this little dive place! I wish they had more than one firepit but - the overall vibe is low-key and chill. This is a must, gets you away from the Strip - good drinks!"}
{"text":"New to vegas ate here after gambling with a guy that recommended it.. I was not dissapointed had a desert that was the size of my head. I have never experienced a place like this but was not dissapointed. Only complaint was how long it took to be seared but overall a great place."}
{"text":"This is a favorite place for my family for breakfast and/or brunch. They have giant portions of good food. They also have great blended drinks. Make sure to come hungry! I recommend the omelettes."}
{"text":"The good and the bad of this place  (read to end to hear the good). The decor is typical over the top Vegas. Even though the exterior does not look like it. Quick service at first, but that is where that stopped. Once our food came,it was hard to find our waitress. We saw more of the photographer hacking snapshots on cheap postcards. (If I wanted a photo of myself here, I would take a selfie). What bothered me most is the pricing. Pancakes are $10.50 and with it made into a combo they charge $13.50 a $3.00 upcharge. If you have a waffle $8.95 and make it a combo. They charge $13.50. A $4.55 charge for the same combo as the pancakes. I brought this to their attention and I was told that its their pricing and couldn't do anything. They have other pricing discrepancy on the menu as well. The manger asked if my meal was OK. I told her the truth that it was less than. She didn't seem to care or offer to make it better. Pricing here is on the high side, but you get Vegas casino feel.. I could of ate next door at Denny's for half the price. What they do give you is much larger portion. 3 eggs instead to 2. And the sausage links were fat and juicy. I don't know if that justifies the cost. I did mention the lack of service to the manager when leaving. And once again no response, not even a \"I'm sorry to hear that\". She just rolled her eyes.  My vote next time. Save a couple of bucks and eat next door at Denny's."}
{"text":"I like to go to Peppermill every time I'm in Las Vegas, it hasn't changed in years the food is consistently good service is consistently good and it's not super expensive. So if you're in Vegas you want some good eats check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab a bite!  I got an omelet which looked to have about 10 eggs worth in it (see my pic).  A huge side of hash browns, and toast.  Yeah, so it's a little expensive (mine was about $12) - but the portions are HUGE.  You get both quality and quantity.  And with all the neon lights and cool vibe, you'll feel like you should be in a Tarantino movie."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. Service was slow and the food was so-so tasteless. Nope that was it for me. Thumbs down to the Peppermill."}
{"text":"We had an event in the Fireside Lounge for the Stomach Cancer Relief Network on March 28, 2011.  We had several reserved areas in the lounge including the main area at fireside.  Everything was beautiful!  We had the best appetizers you could want including Chicken Fingers, Brushetta, Mozzarella Sticks, Fried Shrimp, Onion Rings and all the Dipping Sauces.  Everything tasted absolutely perfect!  Nice size portions on everything.  We gave out drink tokens to our guest and they loved all the different selections they could choose from.  The evening was a hit and I will definitely be back again.  And the staff was awesome as well.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary here and it was the perfect setting! Food was great, large portions and served fairly quickly. No complaints. Definitely check this gem out if you're into old style fun Vegas!"}
{"text":"Poor service in the lounge. Not at all accommodating! They also made me leave my credit card for dinner, I guess they thought Id run! Not a good experience"}
{"text":"Delicious omelets, country fried steak and service was awesome. It's an old style Vegas diner with neon lights. Has amazing energy and great food!"}
{"text":"Father's day dinner plans went out the drain when the babe was called in from 3-11. What's one to do for dinner?  Then I remembered as a kid, I went to Peppermill with my family during those late nights of working late, class or otherwise. I decided to take him and the spawn here. 

We were greeted by a hostess in a rainbow patterned shirt. She was seating other guests so the cashier came up and sat us immediately. As we sat down, a man in an orange Polo (so many different uniforms) brought us water and asked for our drink order. I settled on an orange juice and the babe just had his water. We had Kaitlyn as our waitress. She was really kind, asked about our baby, and took our order. 

WHAT WE HAD: 
Crab cakes
Buiscits and gravy

The crab cakes came in orders of three, topped with diced tomatoes and green onions. They came with a roasted tomato sauce. Both of us loved it!
The biscuits and gravy were good as well. Wish they came out a little hotter, and personally I've had better elsewhere in the valley. My daughter loved them though. 

HIGHLIGHTS 
Retro decor
Rainbow sugar (they had red white and blue for the holidays)
There were different uniforms for the hostess, cashier, manager, bussboy, waitress and lounge service. Try to spot them all!

Overall a good experience, I'll come back for another late night bite!"}
{"text":"When arriving from NY do the following.
1. Get off the plane
2. Drop your stuff off at the hotel
3. Proceed promptly to the cab stand and go to the Peppermill (the lounge portion)

Anything short of that is inexcusable.  This place is the beginning middle and end of any good trip to Vegas.  It will get you in the Vegas vibe immediately and rejuvenate you after a long night out in it's warm bosom of semi-circular banquettes.

The drinks are dead on and the black gown clad waitresses are divine.  Their Manhattan is one of the best I've had anywhere.  The food in both the lounge and the restaurant comes in significant portions.  We usually order the Nachos in the lounge which feeds 2 guys just fine to accompany post travel drinking.

Most important of all, this place has a quiet kitschy mirrored wall pink neon class that connects the present to the Vegas of old."}
{"text":"The lounge OK ....
Well one time years ago b4 YELP ..
We had a couple regular drinks  martinis goood my girlfriend never got I'd check well she is from Europe taller than me ...but younger ...

We all been there  over all is a good place ..
It use to be more romantic but now the lights are so bright ... 
I guess some one got caught on something more than a \" R \" rated more like a xxx actividades
Well I live that place ....."}
{"text":"Too much traffic nearby, prices a little bit on the 
high side, and poor parking on the Strip, brings
my rating down to 3 Stars from my initial thought
of one more star."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, will always keep coming back. A true vegas staple. Always open, always good."}
{"text":"Years ago there used to be a Peppermill in Cupertino California where I lived. It was great! Now I live in Vegas and go to the REAL one downtown. I suggest if you are staying on the strip to go for any meal, the prices and portions are such you can feed 2 for one. Not only a great value, but you can't beat the service. The only reason I won't give it a 5 is access and the wait can be tough. Try it and you will love it. Don't forget to visit the bar and fire pit."}
{"text":"Good place, filled with history.  Quirky decor and within walking distance of our hotel.  Food wad good, the muffins were awesome!  Want to go back some day to have a drink by the fire.  Very cool fire pit."}
{"text":"Kitschy classic. Good value. Huge amount of food. Bloody Caesar was a great. Kind of weird that if you are in the restaurant side you have to ask for a cocktail waitress to take your drink order...took a long time to get our drinks."}
{"text":"I just hade a wonderful experience here at the peppermill....it started with the great hostess & our waiter jorge he displayed a professional & great attitude to me and my guest! I will recommend all of my friends and others to come here great job to all staff members here!"}
{"text":"Great big portion size. Little pricey for diner food but it had all the basics and amuzing disco interior decor to make you chuckle. This area of the strip lacks in good food options so this was a good choice considering the Rivieras sad food court next door."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice service. Make sure you go very hungry, because besides being good food, is massive. Specially the omelets. 
The decor looks like a strip club, but it didn't bother me, made me feel at home."}
{"text":"Went to The Peppermill the other night for a date night meal. When we sat down the buser came and greeted us for drink orders. He was very friendly and funny. Then the waitress took our food orders. She told us the servings were big and she wasnt lying! Late night and we both ordered breakfast. Everything was amazing. My girlfriend in particular loved her hot chocolate and the already ready sprinkles that they have at every table! She always notices little things like that. After the meal, we paid and went next door to check out the firepit. It's in the bar and lounge area. We sat at the firepit and both had a drink, enjoying the warm fire and the good tunes playing. Looking forward to going back as this is now our favorite late night spot!

{"text":"Went here on Mothers Day which wasn't the best time to go, but waited in the cool bar area and chatted with the nice female bartender.  We split the corned beef hash which we asked for crispy and it was awesome!  Our waiter also let us order just one pancake which was huge and those two items were plenty for two women to split.  There was a guy going around taking photos at the tables and at first I thought, \"Heck no!\", but he was really nice and not pushy for us to purchase.  The decor is kind of funny, but I would highly suggest you go here for breakfast.  It's open 24 hours by the way."}
{"text":"Always a good experience when I come here. The experience is unique, and the culture here is a must have. The service is awesome and friendly. Fooooood is allllways wonderful and the wait is never long. I left my hotel at planet Hollywood just to drive down here. My mouth was watering for this place since arriving. If u are in town don't pass up!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why but I always was a little scared of this place. Damn was I wrong! It is really cool inside and the staff is great. I had a solid Bloody Mary and eggs Benedict that was killer! Definitely a great was to start the day off. They serve their entire menus 24 hr a day. Hit this place up and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"A nice clean diner with great food and great service.  The staff is top notch and the food is absolutely delicious! They don't take call-ahead carryout orders anymore, so I ordered when I got there.  I paid, and after a short wait, my food was hot and ready.  Great job Peppermill!"}
{"text":"this place is sooooo smoky! i almost had to cancel my stay after arriving here lol"}
{"text":"Last time to eat here was 20Aug1989. This place does not disappoint. I got seafood omelet with one pancake. Pancakes are big. Server was friendly and food came out hot. Did not get to lounge area because it was very late. I did watch lounge ladies in formal dresses serve cocktails in the restaurant. They came from lounge area door to get food also. We were at shift change but waitresses service did not skip a beat. Good experience."}
{"text":"I like the old school interior and their table sugar!
Generous potion, Good Food.
The wait can be so long at rush hour."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. Definitely a place that offers good food. Be prepared to wait at least 30-45mins because the place is always packed. It's opened 24hrs so you can grab food anytime."}
{"text":"We hit this place about 3 AM after some clubbing.  They have lots of tasty drink selections as well as an around-the-clock breakfast menu.  I shared the eggs benedict with my cuz...it was really good and I don't think that's just the alcohol talking.

Cool kitchy decor in here with lots of neon and faux trees and big booths for all."}
{"text":"Great way to enjoy a reasonably priced meal in an old Vegas style setting. Great for a strong late night drink after partying. Good people watching. The food tastes good, too!  We thoroughly enjoyed the experience last time we were there. It's not a Michelin restaurant, but go if you want to chill and eat."}
{"text":"Decent food, but a really cool old Vegas style atmosphere. If you're just looking for food, there are likely better options around!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place so we HAD to try it out last weekend. The lounge is SUPER KICK ass.. A MUST go to. The Grill is pretty cool to see.. however the food is just A-OK. More of a lunch meal. I HIGHLY recommend hitting the lounge late night after dinner for drinks/apps. The lounge is dark, good music, lots of TV's, sexy u shape couch's with plants/flowers separating the section all around you, a water feature with a fire pit in the middle. Pretty cool must see lounge."}
{"text":"This is a great old school local restaurant with great service and food that is amazing. Big portions this place is kept very clean and has a 70s feel, even plays disco music. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a Las Vegas classic. Fantastic breakfasts, delicious lunches, and an atmosphere that is truly unique. The restaurant is often crowded, and it's not uncommon to have to wait for a table -- but don't let that dissuade you. Time spent waiting in the lounge -- whether at the bar, in a comfy booth or around the great open fire -- is a definite highlight of the Peppermill experience."}
{"text":"This is not a pleasant review to write, because I've always enjoyed the Fireside lounge, and would go back there in a heartbeat when looking for a nice place to have a drink with friends.

However, the Peppermill restaurant seems to have gone downhill since our last visit.  The environment is still wonderful and intimate in its cheesy neon-y way, but something has happened to the food.  Namely, it's no longer worth the price they're now asking for relatively simple fare.

A basic plate of eggs and pancakes is over $10 now.  Omelettes are around $13.  Uh... what?  $3 for coffee... very, very oily coffee.

My chorizo and eggs featured overcooked scrambled eggs with very dried-out chorizo mixed in.  The beans that came with them were right out of a can and heated for way too long, until they were cracked and dry.

My wife's corn beef hash and eggs was runny, with canned hash underneath.  It was greasy and not very good.

Normally, I'd not be so disappointed by greasy or not well cooked breakfast food -- they're not called greasy spoons for nothing -- but for the price, the ire rises dramatically.

It saddens me to say it, but if you're after great breakfast fare in Vegas, go for Blueberry Hill, or Hash House a go-go instead.  You'll be much happier.  Maybe we just got a bad line cook that day, but the impression is going to stick with us for quite a long time."}
{"text":"I stumbled in at about 350am a few weeks ago on a Saturday morning. Maybe it was the day and time that I actually came in, but I was really expecting more from this Vegas classic. The decor was basically strip club fluorescent purple tones with nothing that reminded me of Vegas of the 80's or late 70's when I used to go with my parents as a kid.

The food was good ( a step up from Denny's) and the service was decent. But the worst part of my experience was the patrons. I've never seen such a gathering of hipster douche bags with really bad tattoos - I wish I had my camera.  All I heard around me is people yelling loudly about how they had just rocked out at circus circus or partied at the stratosphere - which is not wrong, just something you don't want to be trying to show off about. My girlfriend and I couldn't even eat comfortably, so we just took our food to go.

Bottom line, if you want get the retro Vegas experience, go to downtown. Its changed, but some places like the horseshoe and especially the freemont still have that 70's and 80's Vegas feel to it. As far as the peppermill (fake retro) big disappointment, but I might try again possibly at a more reasonable time. I recommend it at least once in your life but keep you expectations low."}
{"text":"I come to peppermill everytime I am in vegas. I love the atmosphere and the wait staff are great. The food is awesome and portions are pretty big. What kills it is the hostess and cashiers. They are rude, don't seem to care about anything besides gossiping with each other instead of doing their job. I will go back hoping they fix that problem"}
{"text":"Lived up to it's kitsch vibe. Loved the decor. Sat in the bar. Played video poker. One eye on baseball game...other on the floating fireplace.  Ordered sampler and exotic drinks from James (great bartender). Wait staff was attentive & friendly. Did not dine in the restaurant...bar only.  High marks for a different \"walk back in time\" Vegas experience"}
{"text":"Every dish's amount is huge! Sometimes 2 friends can share one dish. Taste good, service excellent and worth well. Need to wait normally."}
{"text":"Huge portions reasonably priced with great food. Eight of us ate brunch here today.  The burgers, omelettes, country steak and gyro dishes were great.  Awesome onion rings. Highly recommend this restaurant.  Nice Vegas decor. Good for families.  Recommended by the locals as a place where they frequent."}
{"text":"The wife and I have only visited Las Vegas a few times but we always drove by the Peppermill and wanted to try. This trip we did, and what a great choice. Went on a weekday afternoon and no wait, the service was great and food was even better, had eggs with a hamsteak bigger than my head! two thumbs up, great place!"}
{"text":"We went to this place on 7/4/16,  first of all they have the worst service ever, the whole time we were there our waitress only came to get our order, and whenever we need something we had to flag a different waitress, at one point we had to ask the bus boy for help. Anyways let's talk about their food. The Nachos were nasty it was dry, yet the chips managed to be soggy. Did they even try on the cheese? They literally got a bag of store brand cheese and just melted it on top of the Nachos. Mozzarella sticks were ok, the chicken wings were salty, the sausage, the bacon and egg with French toast were mediocre."}
{"text":"My first time here and I enjoyed it.  Went for a late night dinner with some friends and it wasn't crowded at all.  Seated as soon as we walked in and the waitresses were at our table in no time to take orders.  

   I ordered the Hot Pastrami Deli-Style Sandwhich with fries.  First of all the portions they give you for the price is huge!! The sandwhich was 2 layers with mustard and mayo on rye bread that didnt interfere with the taste of the delicious pastrami at all.  The fries were also good, crispy and hot.  

  Employees were very attentive and overall the customer service was great.  Definitely got my money's worth from this place."}
{"text":"This is not about the food, it's about the customer service. We haven't even eaten yet but we overheard the manager(peggy) talking to the waitress about where to sit us and the waitress(vanessa) said we wouldn't fit in a booth and the manager proceeded to say \"well then they don't need to eat\" and they both laughed. That was extremely rude and uncalled for."}
{"text":"Yummy! We are locals and have not been in years. So good. I had the chicken nachos and it came with all the sides you could want. This meal is big enough to share."}
{"text":"An old school Vegas restaurant they are true to what they are famous for.......Huge portions.  
O M G!  The pancake was the size of entire big plate! The pancake, the waffle with fresh fruit were and the coffee were okay.  The peppermill omelette was less tan decent but edible.  This establishment got 3 stars because of the really good service.  The food was 2 stars.  If you like really big portions then this is your place. We waited in The lounge with the fireplace.  That section we would come back to in the evening for a drink."}
{"text":"Nice place to get a reasonable price meal in Vegas. I stop by everytime I'm here in Vegas. The service is immpecable and the waitress uniforms are a plus side.."}
{"text":"waitress was doing the busboys job and accidentally brought us more waters, she said something like no harm in having more waters and left them there

She brought our pastrami burger and fries and wasnt looking when she was putting our plate down at an angle and some fries slid off, she didnt apologize or offer to give us more ...I didnt buy food to eat less of it, its already overpriced as is!  
then she tried to take away my plate of fries while i was grabbing some and she was like 'oh, you're not done?' Obviously not if my hand is on the plate grabbing some fries!

buger was good, nothing spectacular that stands out from any other pastrami burger places....the fries were overcooked and some were dark brown

never again!"}
{"text":"Vegas, am I right?

I'm pretty hungover. But thanks to the peppermill I am now full of greasy omelette and hash browns. For a place in Vegas the prices are pretty decent and as always the portions are massive.

I split the Lorraine Omelette with my wife and it was great. She also had a blueberry muffin that she enjoyed a liiiitle too much. I'd recommend this place to anyone any time as its 24hr breakfast."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place and would recommend anyone staying around the strip or off the strip to make the trip down to this quaint little dinner!

I was spending a short getaway at Encore next door. This is the land of $20 MGD and $26.99 omlettes, so I was itching for a more lowkey place with some real down and dirty breakfast.

I took an uber , but it was  actually a short 8 minute walk from encore. There is plenty of parking and an unassuming exterior. The inside definitely has an 70's acid dream meets the wizard of oz . On the left there is a small bar that plays 90's MTV and firepits lit in hot pink! I ordered two bloody marys which were very inexpensive and very tasty. 

When you're called you either get a booth or table. You get to basque underneath some pink cherry trees as some bright LCD TV's play calm images of tuscan villas or underwater coral reefs.

The food is exactly what you expect. Nononsense large portioned diner food. Good thing it's not too oily or heavy, but definitely fits that home made .


I would love to go after raging at a club at 5 in the morning . Im sure you would get a bunch of characters as well as get an interesting story  to go home with!"}
{"text":"Been wandering into this place wasted for damn near a decade. Throw back diner w/ a crazy Cassbah lounge out back. Strolled in w/ the boys for a late night, post $1000 table service tab, steak and eggs. Food's always fast and tasty. Girls behind counter recommended we go out back to hang w/ some of the working girls. Wasn't into it, was there for the eggs not the legs. Besides, we had already made some of the worst drunk gambling decisions ever. Field, black, black jack. In any combination, did not work!"}
{"text":"It was recommended by a local from Las Vegas, we were taken here for lunch by a freind of my wife's.

Since the portions were very large we shared. I had chicken sandwich (sorry forgot the exact name) with a side of fries. It was great.  

It's opn 24hrs, has a nice bar and nice atmoshere, good service, very quick and they get busy. 
Overall very good place to eat if you stay at Circus Circus or Startosphere cos it's at that end of the strip. It's a great place to have a meal espcially if you are on a low budget. Sandwich with fries was $12.50 if i remeber correct."}
{"text":"Attention travellers to Vegas - this is the spot to go when you're broke, drunk, or looking for a near casino experience that won't surprise you when the bill comes.

Big portions, 100% Columbian coffee, and lots of stick-to-your-ribs choices make it great for breakfast or that post-drunk meal.

As others have noted - the decor rocks.  Everything classic Vegas, right down to the prices, and it's open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Don't let the bartender tell you drinks from the lounge menu during happy hour are the same price from the happy hour menu they are not. $12.50 for a mediocre drink. We got chips and salsa, French toast, Hawaii blue drink, and one Pepsi our total bill with tip was $35.00. Kind of spendy, but it is Vegas. Chips & Salsa $3.50 (happy hour) were pretty good. French toast $9 were pretty good."}
{"text":"I don't know how this has 957 reviews and a 4 star average. I've been to some Denny's better than this place. Food was overall inexpensive, but definitely below average in terms of quality. I ordered their Philly Cheese steak (Yes I realize my mistake being on the west coast), but I was hung over and hungry. Service itself was good, but again, it's really only about the food. The restaurant itself was over the top neon, I felt like I was in a strip club. This place is good if you have no car and are on the strip. We had a car, but were duped into going here by our hotel front desk."}
{"text":"The peppermill is one of the oldest and most established late night eateries in town. The service is always great and expedient. The peppermill is a great place to grab a bite at any time of the day."}
{"text":"So their food isn't all that bad. However I ordered an omelet with no cow cheese (my allergies were acting up) and realized after a few bites they had put both goat and cow cheese on. There was some crazy stringy cheese action going on. I sent it back and the manager Martha brought it out 10 minutes later to point out how there was no stringy cheese. And of course tell me I was wrong because that's the best way to keep customers in their place. Obviously the stringy cheese quality goes away when it's cold!! Way to go Martha! A plus service!"}
{"text":"I make it a point to stop here on every Vegas trip.  Why?  Too die for oven-fresh blueberry muffins.  And it's nice to know that as Vegas changes every year (since I've made Vegas an annual trip at a minimum, I've seen one hotel go every year - Stardust, Frontier, etc.) and continues to become more upscale, the Peppermill (hopefully) will always be around whenever I visit."}
{"text":"Four star only because of service. Service was not horrible but I feel we could have been served better considering we sat at the bar.

Food was great. There are so many great options i could not decide. I was at the bar and kept seeing plate after plate go by and changing my mind. Eventually i came to the conclusion that i needed to get then corned beef and hash since it was that, that brought me in. I'm visiting from AZ so I turned to yelp to find me something new. This was close by and another yelper took a pic of the corned beef and that's why I came in. Was not disappointed. Will be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is good and the portions are HUGE...my only complaint is that it took a while to get served..try it as you will not be dissappointed"}
{"text":"We visited the Fireside Lounge at the Peppermill amd had a great experience! Our bartender Becky was amazing! She provide \"A\" Plus guest service!! The staff working along side Becky (cocktail servers) were wonderful too! I wish there were more service industry professionals like Becky! If you're in Las Vegas and on the strip,  the Fireside Lounge at The Peppermill is a great relaxing environment."}
{"text":"This review is only for the bar and lounge area. The Lounge is really nice with a fireplace and LCDs all around it. I can see myself hanging out here. Really cool looking place.They have a lot of martinis. I glanced at the menu and it looks pretty promising. They have gaming on the bars. As soon as I have a meal here, I will make sure to write a review."}
{"text":"This trip I was disappointed in the Bloody Mary I had been lusting for since booking our tickets. They reduced the size and apparently did not know the term spicy. The food was the same as before- pretty damn good. However, this has gone from a must do in Vegas to \" if everything else is closed.\""}
{"text":"This is my family's fav place to go whenever we're in Vegas. The wait can be kind of lengthy but you can always hang out in the bar while waiting for food. The prices are exceptional for being on the strip and everything on the menus is delicious. Get steak & eggs"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is one big ball of happy. Everything about it makes me giddy. It's neon and pink. There are fake cherry blossom trees and blue velvet chairs and booths. There is a photographer that comes around to the tables and you get a postcard of the photo at the end of your meal (you also have the option of purchasing a larger,  cardboard framed version).  There's rainbow sugar on the table. 

I have been to the Peppermill several times.  I started just going to the Fireside Lounge,  but on the last few trips,  I've eaten at the diner too.  The food is really good and very reasonably priced for the Las Vegas Strip.  Last time I was there, I had a spinach omelete,  which was giant and delicious.  The pancakes and hashbrowns were also tasty. 

The Peppermill is a must see when you are in Vegas. The Fireside Lounge next door is beyond kitschy and has all kinds of tropical drinks,  even some non-alcoholic ones. They serve honey roasted peanuts and play ridiculous music videos.  If there's a wait for a table at the diner,  take a seat at the bar and wait while sipping a Zombie or virgin Pina Colada."}
{"text":"Such an iconic place. We think it's fun to go in somewhere and feel as though you're stepping into 1974 instantly.
 It's lends itself to plenty of conversation, so a great place to take acquaintances visiting from out of  town that you have been delegated to host for a night!"}
{"text":"Do you want your racism straight up or on the rocks?
Over the phone, a Peppermill manager said this policy is only in place on the Strip and only in the Fireside Lounge. They've stood by it for 10 years, saying they've asked other Muslim women to take off their head coverings, and asked people of the Jewish faith to remove their yarmulkes."}
{"text":"Went here one day for breakfast & their signature cocktail (scorpion ). 

Everything was tasty from the drink to the pancakes to the eggs (which they poached for us - some places refuse to do this...?!?) to the sausage. 

I HIGHLY recommend going here.  It's a must go to spot for me whenever I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions. 

I highly recommend this place for families, don't be scared to share! Your waistline will appreciate it."}
{"text":"Awh, second trip to Peppermill and I was highly disappointed this time around. After visiting on our last trip and immensely enjoying the food and experience,  the wife and I chose to revisit for our wedding celebration to share the french toast ambrosia and a few drinks before heading back to the hotel. Awful. The french toast was undercooked and unappealing while the fruit itself was not ripe or much beyond edible. The fruit salad and french toast on our flight home on Delta was ten times better and very delicious. It's sad when airline food is better than the Peppermill. I had a Mai Tai and the wife had an espresso martini (which was horrible).  As for service, eh, it was okay, she brought us drinks and our food. We didn't tip and that is rare. We finished our one drink each and made a hasty retreat. Overall, save yourself and don't go. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough and I pray it never shuts down.

My love for Anthony Bourdain's show No Reservations prompted me to check out this place and we had a blast.

The place is tacky in the most awesome way possible...neon lights, mirrors line the walls and fake shrubs everywhere just add to the ambiance. We went on a Thursday, well, early Friday morning and it was the perfect amount of busy. There were 4 of us and we found a place to sit right away. The seating is cool and intimate. The actual fire lounge area is meant more for couples as the couches that circle it only seat 2 people. 

Looking around the joint, it was a good mix of people. There were some couples on dates, the obvious locals, larger groups and everyone was having a chill, good time.

The specialty drinks are as tacky as the decor and again, I say that in the most loving way. The four of us shared a big ass fruity drink called the Scorpion and then ordered 4 separate cocktails. We also ordered the sampler platter that consisted of fried chicken strips, fried mozarella, fried shrimp, onion rings and bruscetta, basically drunk people food :) Our bill was only about $70!

As far as I know it's open 24 hours, it's in the dicey area of the strip but who cares! It's worth the possible mugging  ;) We only hung out in the lounge area, didn't check out the restaurant so I can't comment on that.

This will be on our list of things to do while in Vegas for now on without a doubt."}
{"text":"Let's say a Greek restaurant/bar and grill style eating establishment went to a strip club, got wasted, had a one night stand with said strip club, and knocked the strip club up. Well, Peppermill would be the love child.

This casual dining restaurant on the north end of the Strip between the Riviera and Encore/Wynn is... kinda strange when it comes to decor.

The place is super dark, with black floor to ceiling and then neon blue and pink lights accenting just about everything. I was uncertain about actually eating here because the decor just does not evoke the kind of restaurant it actually is.

As for the food, it's definitely above average, family restaurant fare. Lots of breakfast items available all day long, plus a long list of sandwiches and the like. I treated myself to a plate of nachos as an entree since I had been craving them all week. They were among the better I've had, with real melted cheese on top, although they did go a bit overboard with the beef. The people from my conference I was with seemed to enjoy their cheesesteak and burger as well. It probably won't be the best you've ever eaten, especially if you're from a bigger city, but it's pretty darn good.

The service wasn't so spectacular. Our waitress wasn't very attentive and had this attitude about her that wasn't so much pleasantly refreshing as it was, \"I have better places to be than here, but that isn't your fault so I'm not going to be outright mean.\"

And the prices, definitely higher than comparable places not in Las Vegas, but still far cheaper than most of what you'll find on the Strip. And the portions are pretty huge. I couldn't finish my nachos, and I had barely eaten anything else that day up until that point.

So yeah, it's far from perfect, but it's a nice place to eat when you want a good sit down meal, but are sick and tired of being fancy on the Strip."}
{"text":"Food was good didn't take long once we ordered... I had the souther fried steak.  Waitress was talking to other waitresses near the kitchen and rarely checked on us. Had to ask for more coffee."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is always good at anytime! I have been here late nights, early mornings and during the day. Anytime I go they have fast service and are always on it."}
{"text":"We visit Vegas several times a year so we like to find new (to us) & interesting places to try.  In perusing Tripadvisor while sitting in the Firefly parking lot (our go-to place) we came upon Peppermill restaurant & decided to try it based on review of locals.  Oh my, what a trip.

We drove up to this restaurant down toward the older part of the strip around 11:20AM on a Saturday  morning; there were people waiting outside.  We decided to try it anyway & went inside the where the hostess took our name for a 35 minute wait.  We went to check out the lounge - you MUST check out the lounge.

Tacky might be a good adjective but fun tacky like a walk back into the 70s.  Neon lights, mirrors and silk/plastic florals & greenery throughout the darkened room illuminated with multiple tvs playing music videos from days past; seating is in semi-circular pit arrangements.  The bar was full with some patrons playing video poker while others just took in the scene.  The focal point of the lounge, however, is the step down fire pit with the flame glowing in the middle of a pool of water.  There was a guest of honor from a bachelorette party interestingly clad with various monetary units & mints hanging from her ensemble hamming it up two couples who wandered in with their 70's garb and took multiple \"what happens in Vegas stays...\" photos.  It was a free show!  Oh, the drinks were fine - my bloody Mary was a bit pricey but it did come in a hurricane glass (remember those?)

When our name was called for brunch - we were seated at a window booth (all booth seating).  The floral motif continued and was accompanied by tiffany style lighting.  We saw omelets the size of your head go by - and the line outside continued.  Since it was the noon hour by this time we chose to order sliders & pesto chicken sandwich from our waitress wearing a carhop type of getup (short skirt).  Both food orders were really good and accompanied by a copious pile of fries. 

Peppermill seems to be a local favorite but many taxis came through too.  The after noon timeframe brought in a younger set of patrons - the line had gotten a bit shorter but it would no doubt get longer as the late night crowd woke from their night of partying.  It's on our list for a return visit."}
{"text":"Not really knowing about this place, we decided to try it out. Wow. We were NOT disappointed one bit. The scorpion bite drink was HUGE and pretty pricey, but worth it for sure. 

I cant wait to go back this summer, and try their food.."}
{"text":"Comparable to Denny's, IHOP, etc. Larger portions mostly bland, not the best coffee. Long wait there are better places in the area"}
{"text":"This would have been my second time going to this place I thought it was alright the first time 8 years ago. Well this time it wasna horrible experience when my wife and I arrived it was jammed packed there was a 45 min wait.  So we were offered to sit in the lounge to have a drink and wait for a table. Well we walked in and it was dark and it looked like a sex den out of the 70's tables were dirty and there were questionable stains on the cloth lounges I was feeling a bit uncomfortable. So a waitress cleaned off our table and asked what we wanted to drink so my wife ordereda drink for us to share because it was a large drink and I hadnt ate yet. But the kicker was that the Peppermill has a no hat policy in their lounge? Strange I had a hat on it was a tastful hat nothing gang related or any of that cliche stuff, I was asked to remove my hat because they had problems in the past with people wearing hats strange? I refuse to remove my hat because not only I didnt see a sign stating it but i saw few indivduals in the same area wearing hats so I asked for management, management arrived and she stated that it was just there policy she could gove me a solid reason for the policy she proceeded to tell me about their lawyers came up with this policy odd? So I asked her if I had an open wound or religous wrap hat on my head I would be refused services or would be asked to leave there lounge at this point I was bother by the BS policy the manager offered to see if she could bump up our table wait so im able eat in their dining room with my hat but cant drink in their lounge what BS. I was uncomfortable about the whole thing and I left. This nearly cost my vacation to be ruined cause my wife wanted to eat there still at the Peppermill and i refused too because their double standard unexplainable rule."}
{"text":"In Vegas on business and heard this was a cool spot. Right away, the hostess sat me at a dirty table. When I asked for a wipe down, she proceeded to wipe the crumbs with her bare hands and said, \"There...it's no longer dirty.\" Guests sitting nearby where shocked. 

I eventually got the wiped down. The pepper mill was broken on the table and the food was very bland with no flavor. However, The atmosphere is cool. The waitresses are very nice. There are two sets of folks that bring you drinks. I think I can find better breakfast spots next time."}
{"text":"P-mill is that 24 hour diner that's no joke 
It's like the ones you see on diners drive ins & dives
(If you don't know what that show is you should not be on yelp)
But with a Vegas twist.

Ok so first thing is this place is located on the north side 
Of the strip so you will see the typical homeless men,working girls
And worst of all tourist but don't fret it's worth the danger.

The inside is a Vegas style diner where every table I saw was a booth
The waitresses are dressed old school cheerleader style and they're very nice 
It just feels clean and fresh for a diner I didn't expect that

Now to the food ; the portions are out of control huge 
But most of all it's fresh food not Denny's IHOP BS
I highly recommend the French toast ambrosia, hash browns
Lemon blueberry muffins, Chicken fried steak or any dessert
The food is great diner food triple d worthy

This place is very underrated in my book with so many 
Ridiculously Horrible Fake ass 4 star restaurant on yelp like 
Bistro pizza who's 4.5 stars but Settlebellos is 4 what a joke  
If Bistro is 4.5 so is chuckie cheese 
or Ventano Italian where they serve Chef Boyardee or
Hanks in Gvr which is lame station casino Buffett food
Designed  as fine dining
station casino \"Where we Hate locals\" 
Ok let me stop and count to 10 before I call out all you wack ass 
Wannabe restaurants on yelp
 
The mill that is pepper is a ideal place to take your fat uncle 
Or any other fat relatives you have 
Take your drunk buddies or a late night date 
But don't take anyone with a small appetite
not the right spot for quitters"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is fantastic! Super delicious, fast service and very Vegas 80's ambience.

The portions are MASSIVE! My fiance and I shared an omelet and weren't able to finish the halves! The prices are kind of up there for a breakfast joint, but given that you can easily share the dishes between two people (and possible three!) the price evens out.

Will most certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"The PepperMill of Vegas is a place I was referred to on my way out from a work friend. 

His quote....\"You can do a lot of #@%$ in Vegas, but you have to try Peppermill\". I'm thinking this guy is stoned or something... with all the buffets and food in Vegas, I'm going to wander down to a little diner? 

HELL YES!!! 
PepperMill looks like no other when you walk in and the food is awesome. The portions are huge as you can see from the pics people have added. It's nicely set up and perfect for a meal at any time or the day or night... 

Again, HUGE portions... and it's not crappy either... All is good tasting. If you go in really later, you'll see this place is hoping. The waitresses are all very friendly and offer advice to the new Vegas traveler. 

Add it to your sight-see's of Vegas... I'll be back in 2 weeks and will make it my first stop! (this place sits just North of the Riviera hotel...)"}
{"text":"I love the Peppermill from their retro chic Vegas decor to the friendly waitresses. My grandparents loved this place and I can see why - it's a refreshing change from the buffet lines. 

The coffee aroma fills the restaurant and unlike an unmentioned coffee house the coffee awakens the soul. The breakfast is abundant and tastes like your grandma would make (at least for those of us with grandmas that can cook).

As you can tell I'm a sucker for this place."}
{"text":"Always be good place to stop by for breakfast or brunch. The atmosphere is great.  Takes you back to earlier Vegas decades."}
{"text":"Another nice surprise on our road trip. Had the pear, cranberry, walnut salad and it was very tasty. This was the salad where you got a bite of something good every time. They were not stingy with the portion. Hubby had the Philly cheesesteak and good portion of filling to bread. Waitress was attentive and smiling all the time. Glad we went at 5pm, the place filled up with people waiting by the time we finished our meal. Looks like a popular local spot. It was $32 with a soda and ice tea.  Today is 9/22/2013. This could almost be rated a 5."}
{"text":"love the atmosphere here.... laid back and relaxing.... food was good, a must try is the crab cakes. drinks were a lil slow coming but worth the wait"}
{"text":"Fun retro restaurant decor combined with strong offerings and cocktails makes this choice idiot proof. Serving sizes are bordering on silly. This is positively the most Vegas of any Vegas restaraunt."}
{"text":"Fun retro place with large portions, we shared a 12 , yes twelve, egg omelette. Bar is cool, but appetizers for food only. 
PS. Senior menu starts at age 60!"}
{"text":"nice classic diner.  good food"}
{"text":"cool old vegas decor and a bunch of half dressed women there. thats where the positive ends. other than that thx for the heartburn and the non existent service. ive never not tipped before. thanks for being my first"}
{"text":"I love the Peppermill. Great place to come for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Especially if you have a hangover! Large portions. The wait can be a bit long so I'd suggest getting a drink in their Fireside Lounge. I love the colorful sugar, fake trees and the funky uniforms. Overall a fun place to go after a long night in Vegas. I've been several times and have never been disappointed. It's like an upper scale, funkier Denny's."}
{"text":"This place is a classic.  I always visit when I'm in Las Vegas.  The food is tasty, a little pricey (but not bad compared to hotels,) and the ambiance is second to none.  You really get all types here, my local friends love it as much as people that fly into Vegas for a weekend.  The ten egg omelets are quite delicious and filling.  Do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"The bad first:
Sitting is tight. If you are pregnant or are just a bigger person you will either be uncomfortable or just plainly not fit. 
The food is diner quality not better or worst.
The decor is old and trashy.
The staff rush you out of there very quickly.
The good:
There's free parking and the adult drinks are huge."}
{"text":"The restaurant advertises itself as having vegan friendly options...could not be farther from the truth.  When we walked in and asked about vegan options they looked at us like we were crazy but offered some of there standard dishes without meat and dairy.  Since we were with other folks who were not vegan, we had to eat something so we tried modifying a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich without meat and cheese.  What came out of the kitchen was a cold bun with a couple slices of tomato, a few pieces of uncooked bell pepper and onion and side of fires.  No seasoning was added to the veggies to try and make the meal eatable for us... and we were charge full price, $13.99 for our \"salad\" sandwich.  The non-vegans who were with us ordered Chicken Cesar Salad.  They complained that their salad had very little dressing and the chicken was overcooked and dry.  We had no time to complain to management since we had waited a long time for service and we had to leave to catch a flight.  This place is clearly another Vegas tourist trap not interested in return business.  Highly overrated."}
{"text":"Wow, I remember a time not so long ago (well into the 1990's) when \"Steak and eggs on-demand 24 x  7, $5.95\" was synonymous with Las Vegas and partaking of such fare at the Flamingo, the Stardust, and the real Vegas casinos was an essential part of the Vegas experience.  Fast forward-ing to Steve Wynn's Vegas of 2014 can be dismally unsettling and attempting to get ANY real dinner past 10PM will end up being a disappointing if not downright depressing quest.  Pretty ironic given the shows let out between 10-11.  Enter Peppermill..  Best thing I ever did was ask my cab driver where to get a steak dinner after a show at the Westgate, he dropped us off at Peppermill and stepped into the Vegas I know and love.  The food, full steak dinner, fabulous ambience, and the place was packed with like-minded late-night eaters.  I remember Peppermill from Santa Clara of the mid 1990's - I hear it's gone - it was the same place as this, though randomly placed across Intel, HP, AMD buildings- an oasis/breath of fresh air amid a rapidly developed Silicon Valley locus, same vibe, same neon, all good...."}
{"text":"Very cool ticky-tacky neon and plastic flowering plants decor is over-the-top in a fun way.  Kind of feels like dining inside a tropical-themed pinball machine (minus the deafening bells and the giant metal balls that could crush you, that is.)  Service is exceptionally attentive, especially when your drink is empty.  What I LOVED was my pastrami sandwich.  Big and tasty, toasted bread, this sandwich would be right at-home on 6th Avenue in Manhattan. They missed their fifth star with a lackluster Caesar salad, which, in addition to not really being a Caesar salad (DON'T get me started on that topic, almost no one makes a real Caesar salad any more) was also limp and lacking sufficient dressing.  My friend had a Porterhouse that was tasty, cooked to his liking, and priced reasonably.  Free and easily accessible parking, too.

I still love this place.  One of my go-to's in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is not special beyond the unique atmosphere.  Corned beef hash is my cornerstone measurement of a dish and it was simply standard fare.  A bit watery and likely just from a can.  The only thing different about it was the oddly large portion size.  Sorry peppermill but it was just \"ok\".  Far better breakfast joints in Vegas."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, being a Las Vegas staple and all that. 
I would recommend ordering bar foods. 
The ribeye was not that good, especially for $31. The steak was lower grade, lots of fat (and not in the traditional yummy marbling way of ribeye steaks). The onion strings served on top were mainly just fried bread. 
The mashed potatoes were fake. They even tasted fake. Probably the worst part of the meal. If I was a famous Las Vegas restaurant, I'd be embarrassed to even list mashed potatoes as a side option. 
The sautéed mushrooms were probably my favorite part of the food. 
The side Caesar was decent but had little dressing, and had to ask for more. 
The water tastes like bad tap water. 
I really liked the atmospheric diner charm."}
{"text":"Food was really yummy!!! Especially the hot wings! The servings are huge! They're open all night, & serve breakfast 24/7.  Our waitress, Kylie was awesome & attentive! I wish I had some of those wings right now."}
{"text":"What a fantastic venue in Vegas! What fun, wonderful atmosphere and the food was spectacular! The bar is right out a of a scene in the movie Casino where you enjoy a fireside cocktail! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Food is good....I give that 4 stars.....Our Server....What a BAD ATTITUDE! !!!  One Star is Generous."}
{"text":"I love this place great food but my favorite is the lounge so beautiful love it!"}
{"text":"Fail.

Where to start.  How about how our waitress didn't show up to our table for about 20 minutes.  Much of the awfulness of this place does have to do with possibly the worst person who has ever called herself a waitress.  I'm not sure how many tables she was responsible for but the wait at the door would have been at least 20 minutes less if she was even remotely competant.  The food was below average and cold and not cheap.  Denny's quality with gourmet prices...no thank you.  
With as much velvet and neon in this place the waitress should do a strip tease or something before I get my eggs."}
{"text":"For Old Vegas nostalgia and LOTS of good food, you can't beat the Peppermill.  Neon lights in bright colors, Naugahyde booths, artificial vines, huge portions, and a very romantic lounge make this landmark a fun visit.  We sat at the counter yesterday for breakfast, because the restaurant was very busy, and we were really amazed at how much work the waitstaff do.  The area is not very big and it's fun to watch the staff carefully maneuvering around each other.  Portions are very big and the food is always good.  Would highly recommend to locals as well as tourists"}
{"text":"The best thing about going to the Peppermill was that I could cross it off my \"To Try\" list.  Maybe we caught it on an off night?  We went at dinner time and the place was full.  I had breakfast as that was recommended to me by friends.  Pancakes were horrible.  Dry, crumbly and unsaveable even with a dousing of syrup.  Two cute little pieces of bacon cowering in a corner of the huge plate.  The friend across from me had the chicken fettuccine alfredo.  Two dry, overcooked pieces of chicken sitting on a pile of pasta and sauce that was at the point where you could stand a fork in it.  With proper fork placement you could have lifted at least half if not the whole serving of pasta at one time.  Had to go back to the Cal and have Chili rice.
Well, lesson learned.  Peppermill, Check!"}
{"text":"If this review were based on the food quality alone, I would give The Peppermill three stars.  It's typical diner fare.  

But the venue is extremely cool, and rates an extra star.

If you happen to be Andre the Giant or a member of the I.F.O.C.E, you'll be able to eat everything on your plate.  Otherwise, I'm not liking your chances.  In other words, the portion sizes are quite large.  I ordered the chorizo and eggs and a Miller Lite(!)...was able to muscle my way through them, but barely touched the accompanying refried beans.  Very tasty.

I sat at the counter, so I was able to see a lot of entrees come off the line and hear the waitresses complain about each other.  Riveting.
The waffle would feed a family of four, I swear.

The Peppermill is just a diner with a lot of flair.  I'll return on my next visit to LV.  You should too!

{"text":"Best food ! I had breakfast there (French toast platter) it was amazing! I'm not big on diners and this isn't the fanciest place but our cab driver recommended it. Best breakfast I had my entire trip to Vegas. Also try their mimosas! So yum!"}
{"text":"Whoa! The decor in this greasy spoon is utterly craptacular! The combo of blue lighting with red neon, mirrored ceilings, marble counters and full-size faux cherry trees in bloom is truly a sight to behold. The fire pit surrounded by water in the lounge is a sight for sore eyes as well. Check out the uniforms on the waitresses. Who knew you could do so much with so little floral patterned polyester? 

The food is decent and the portions are HUGE. We made the mistake of going when we first got to Vegas. This place would be the perfect stop after a night of heavy drinking. The food is good enough and the value is there. 

The people watching is utterly top notch. It's worth the trip as long as you're prepared for a trip to Tackyland."}
{"text":"OVERRATED!! Disgusting food, service was mediocre the first time, went back again for gross food and worst service. Will not be back again"}
{"text":"I VERY rarely walk out of places, but I did here. The service was slow and disorganized. Watching from our seats at the counter as food was being prepped completely ruined our appetites."}
{"text":"I have to update my review - imagine my surprise, when after seeing a magic show with the kids at the Riviera, we passed the Peppermill. Wait a minute - I swear I have been here before. Maybe it's sad when you have to consult Yelp to figure out what you did about 3 years ago, but I did.

This time, we were here with the kids, and we had a fantastic night - maybe the best night of our whole trip, because after feeding Thing 1 and Thing 2 a massive burger / pancake / french toast / whatever the hell they ate they insisted on having a dessert. 

\" Too much food \" we said \" you'll never finish it \"

\"OH YES WE WILL\"

\"Wanna bet?\" Oh yeah baby.

The largest banana splits I have ever seen in my life arrived - they must have had 5lbs of ice cream and four bananas apiece on them, there was no way the boys are going to finish them. They approached their task with grim determination. After a few minutes it was clear they were not enjoying themselves - this was work.

\" you're not allowed to stop - you have to finish them \"

\" what sort of parents are you guys that you are making us eat this -this is force feeding, this is torture - you guys are completely irresponsible\"

Jesus, I laughed so much. It was fantastic. Great service, great food, great value - and they had a Fog Cutter on the menu - it was a bit sweet, but it was decent enough."}
{"text":"The prices are outrageous for the location, and the policy (that is apparently fairly new) that they will not split the check is ridiculous. Pointing out their ATM's as if that makes it ok is infuriating. Never again."}
{"text":"The food is good for sharing  and they have someone come by to take a photo of you and keep for memories great drink prices as well. Mai Tai is my fave there! The service is slow though so if you don't mind waiting, stop by!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Peppermill in many years. I used to frequent one in Santa Clara after a late nights out, so it was very nostalgic to eat there again.  It truly is old town Vegas. The service was fine and so was the food. I had a salmon with potato salad. The vegetables on the side were a bit bland, but often that's the case. I'll have to go back to try their strawberry shortcake, my favorite dessert. I had no room that night, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Fish and chips were excellent. Sooooo much food though. Definitely could have shared. My boyfriend had the corned beef hash with eggs. We wanted to try one of the desserts but were way too full. This may have to be a standard stop every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place...It is where I have breakfast when I visit Vegas....The food is not like the best food I have ever had ...but seriously they never disappoint if you need breakfast or some late night eats..."}
{"text":"SERVER:  Our waitress CJ was THE BEST and made ALL the difference in our experience here!!  She is very knowledgeable of the food they serve & was spot on with her suggestions. Although she was busy, she was very warm, friendly and attentive.

FOOD:  Eggs Benedict (as CJ said) was yummy!  

I ordered the Western fruit plate / platter that usually comes with banana bread & marshmallow cream sauce which 1) I did not want and 2) they did not have, so CJ asked if I wanted a muffin or something in lieu. Of my choices, I  chose the lemon muffin which CJ said was really good and it REALLY was! Loved it!  The only thing....CJ could have warned me of the large amount of fruit that I had unknowingly ordered. Yikes! But so yummy!

ESTABLISHMENT:  Came across Peppermill via Yelp, and its old school Vegas charm & good reviews made us pick it as our late breakfast / lunch destination.

Haven't been to Vegas for nearly 9 years now, I  initially thought the low ceilings, neon lights & crowd made this to be a wrong choice on our part.

Even at 2 in the afternoon, it was crowded with a steady stream of people.  We were greeted right away, the gal took our name, told us it was about a 20 minute wait and said we could wait in the bar if we'd like. 

The bar is to the left, separated from the dining area itself.  Thank goodness cuz it was a bit too smokey for our taste.  Cool bar area though!  Just a little to early in the day for us for that atmosphere.  (Yes, we're a little older in age.  Oh and I'm a former smoker.)

We waited in the entry area instead which is kinda small, with slot machines on one wall & a big support beam towards another wall.

We waited about 10-15 minutes before being called for our table. Because the hostess called two parties & we both approached the hostess desk, there was a little confusion about who she was taking to be seated.

There was a gal walking around offering to take a \"complimentary\" picture of us, but we declined.  She was nice, not pushy, but....no thanks.

There was a gal dressed in a long black dress (wait staff, hostess, cashier had uniforms), asking us for any drink orders.  Nice & attentive, remembered to check on us.

SUMMARY:  Cool place to check out. Our waitress made our experience exponentially better.  Other staff was nice.  Food was yummy.  

Would we go back again? Probably not.  But this review comes from a near 50, partied hard in my younger days but now I'm more into the wine & chill scene, kind of person.  

Would we suggest people go check it out at least once? Definitely....and ask to sit in CJ's section.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Fantastic diner!  No frills but very good food.  Service was friendly and fast.  

Place was busy but we were able to grab a seat at the bar.  Got to see all the plates come out and man did they look good.  Started with a bloody  Mary and it was spot on!  A separate cocktail waitress had to take that order but didn't take long.  My entree of French toast Collage - 4 wedges of French toast, 2 sausage, 2 bacon and eggs was huge.  Had to get a to go box for half of it.  French toast was cooked perfect  and the sausage link had the best flavor.  Hubbie had huge bowl of oatmeal with all the fixings and a side of lemon cranberry muffins which not only looked good but tasted great - very moist.  

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Disgusting portions of cheap and unhealthy grub. And long lines."}
{"text":"From what I'm hearing this place gets packed. Luckily we had someone wait for us in advance. Be prepared to wait for a table.

Ordered what was recommended via yelp, country fried chicken and crab cake eggs benedict. Crab cake overshadowed fried chicken by far; wished we had ordered 2 of those instead. 

Service was great! Al introduced himself and took care of all our needs; checked on us numerous of times and made sure everything was ok.  Our drinks were always full."}
{"text":"This place was a highlight of our LV stay. It's not huge and impersonal like so many other things on the Strip. And it still has some of the old character from days gone by. We had lunch and the food was good, portions were large and the price was reasonable, especially for the location. We got there at noon and had to wait 40 minutes for a table.

The fire pit was neat, although we didn't spend any time in the lounge -- too smokey."}

{"text":"This place is amazing. They have a variety of different foods and not to mention their portions are pretty large!! Seriously, if you're going there with two you guys can most likely share an appetizer or entree :) the prices are decent considering the large portions. The staff is always friendly and waitresses are always bringing you drinks. I love this place because it's 24 hours and when I'm craving ribs or pasta at 11 pm I can always count on them haha :)"}

of course we started with the fruit plate ( the fruit was very good - needed more pineapple !!  more marshmallow for the banana bread !! )
daughter had hamsteak, her friend had a pancake/egg/sausage combo, i had hash w/ basted eggs....as always - large portions - we left with more than 1/2 the food ( ate it on the drive home !! ) my only minor dings - the hash tasted like canned hash.  the service slow even though the place was not busy...but the server was very, very nice !

you gotta show this place some love !!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!  I come here at least once every time I'm in Vegas, I have been here about 5 times already this year!  I usually go to the lounge in the early morning hours where I enjoy an oatmeal cookie martini, and sometimes comfort food.  On my most recent trip I sat in the restaurant part and was very impressed with the food and portion sizes!  Next time I am going to try the breakfast, it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas I have to make a stop here. The food is amazing. And very large portions. My daughter and I always split 1 meal, and are stuffed. Have always gotten great service, and have always been very pleased with our food."}

{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Had breakfast with bacon, hash browns, scrambled eggs and blueberry muffin. Eggs were a bit underdone for my liking. Hash browns were really good and muffin was amazing!"}
{"text":"Ultimate couples and family gathering eatery. Portions are huge and entrees should be split (or expect to take a doggy bag). The Fireside lounge is great for intimate conversation or group chats while enjoying a cocktail. The definitive non-casino restaurant on the Strip. This is where the locals bring visiting family and/or friends."}
{"text":"My sister & I visited this restaurant on vacation from Houston, TX, and there was a lot of confusion from the start. The host & cashier weren't on the same page as far as seating. We were told to stand near the cashier, Jennifer, for 1st come seating at the bar. Jennifer did not greet us, until I spoke to her. I then went on to confirm if this is where we needed to stand & she confirmed unknowingly (looking confused). 

Jennifer advised there were 2 openings coming up.

So, as I looked near the bar, some man from the restaurant walks near the open seat, without being in the line, so I informed Jennifer, but she just said he's not supposed to. She did not help, so I walked near the seat to see if the guy was actually sitting, and he did. 

I then asked for a manager. Martha, the manager brushed off our concerns by saying, \"Well, that's only one seat anyway!\" 

So, we were given false information from Jennifer, and the manager made as if we making a big deal out of the seat, since it was only one, but we were advised of the seating rules from the host & Jennifer. First bad impression! 

The food & our server, Horacio, was exceptional. Ask to be seated with him."}
{"text":"Very \"Vegas\". Was not a huge fan of the atmosphere. I felt like everything was really dirty and of course, being in a restaurant, that would freak most people out. The water tasted weird and the food was alright. I've had better. This place is more nostalgic than anything."}
{"text":"I was there last week for a Trade Show and didn't want to spend a ton of money so I walked over to the Peppermill. It was like the restaurant was stuck in the 70's but I quickly got accustomed to the lights. Since i was by myself and I didn't want to sit at one of the large booths I sat at the counter. The waitress came over quickly with water and the menu and the woman who delivers drinks (holy cow!) came over to ask if I wanted anything from the bar. No draft beer there but a nice cold bottle of Corona. As I watched the dishes passed over from the chefs I couldn't believe how large the portions were. I ordered the Reuben and potato salad and couldn't finish it all. The sandwhich was very good and the potato sald was (not as good as Mom's) but decent. I would def go back there again."}
{"text":"Terrible experience, my boyfriend got terrible food poisoning and I wasn't feeling well after eating here. When we called to talk to manager, she stated that we didn't get sick from their food and it must have been something else we ate the night before instead of apologizing and taking responsibility. Not to mention all the creeps and strange people that were in there"}
{"text":"Decided  to give this place a try. Upon walk in and putting my name down, I notice  the décor. The waiting   area has 3 tv screen showing fish. The place  has lots of neon and plush seats, very beautiful. The place  was very crowed  with a 45 minute wait. Took  a quick  peek into their  fireside lounge. wow was it amazing looking with very beautiful fire pits. Pictures on here do not do it justice. Finally get seated. Did  not  care for them serving Pepsi over coke (thanks to the drink  server for making it a point to me). We were a party of 3. I went for the Philly cheese steak and onion rings. When it arrived i was in aww at it's size. It look amazing and it was. Generous portions of steak covered I'm melted cheese and pepers. Wife got the foccacia chicken  sandwich also with onion rings. It also looked amazing. She really enjoyed it. My brother got the country fried  steak with mashed pots and veggies, also came with a hearty chicken noodle  soup. He also enjoyed it. Service was good. Now for price, ie say a bit in the high side  but not  for what you get. Price are similar to claim jumpers. All in all this will be our  new go to spot, when in town. Yum yum"}
{"text":"Learned about this place a few years ago on Yelp.  (Thanks everyone!) This was our second time back. Always fun, no matter who you're with. I read somewhere it was voted the best makeout bar in vegas and I can see why.

Total 70's vibe, fun and great firepit.  The drinnks are about $9 each, so we decided to share the $18 scorpion, which refreshes 2 people.  Giant straws (and yes, steve really did put them together and move them towards our neighbors beverage - they laughed - we were safe)."}
{"text":"Just like many folks out there, this place is a must stop for me when I am in Vegas. Think about The Peppermill as Denny's on crack  Same prices, same hours but they serve liqour, have muuuuuch better food and the portions are ginormous! I love a place that doesn't hold back on the portions and this place, in true diner style, feeds it patrons like they are at home. I usually go for a giant omelette which comes with a bagel and all the fixings.

For some reason i always eat here before the drive home, and I always regret it because I'm always in a food coma upon leaving lol."}
{"text":"The food is decent. Nothing to write home about. I would say a step above Denny's taste wise but with double the portions. Not badly priced at all especially considering the portions . I would have given it three stars except for....

The Drinks are a RIPOFF!!! The bartender literally pours one tenth of a shot of liquor into the drinks but makes sure to charge you full price!! While this does seem to be an epidemic in Vegas this place is definitely one of the worst offenders!!! 

The scenery is unique especially in the lounge . It has a retro futuristic kind of vibe . Definitely get a seat at the fire pit. Great place to talk and relax but byob!"}
{"text":"It was so fun being here my friends and I had a blast there we a lot of food and a lot of appetizers! Over all experience was great!"}
{"text":"My family had a great breakfast and the amount of food was more than enough.  We took home leftovers and still eating it a day later.  The waitress was great!"}
{"text":"This is a diner style restaurant. Super food, huge portions, great service. It's not the cheapest place you can go but the protons are so big that they compensate for the price."}
{"text":"Great food!! Great service!! Don't be offended by the neon lights... It's Vegas Darlin'!!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Grabbed a couple drinks at the Fireside Lounge after walking through the Sahara (one last time) with a friend.  I guess we were making it a cheesy old Vegas kind of night.  

Weird mix in that the lounge feels like it used to be a strip club, while the diner looked slightly nicer than your typical Denny's.  At least the 2 are separated by a glass door.  The couches in the lounge are cool and it one of those places were you could relax with your girl around the faux fire for a couple hours with drinks and just veg out.  Drinks were nothing to write home about.

Not sure I'll be back anytime soon tho; this place was just a bit too cheesy."}
{"text":"Service was God Awful tonight. I came in about 10pm.  Not crowded that's a good thing.  But the waiter was extremely slow.  I was so hungry. He kept helping other tables. I came with a party of 6.  There was kids with no home training playing in the restroom. We notified the cashier girl and she did nothing.  Like I was speaking a different language. Not good for business.  The toilet overflowed with the seat covers stuffed in it. Gross!!! I usually tip but not this trip.  Get it together.  I love coming to this place.  It was not good. It looks like a whole new staff."}
{"text":"Really good food. I had the country fried steak, eggs, and bacon. My friends enjoyed their meals as well. The waitress, Michelle, was nice and friendly to us."}
{"text":"Everything you want at 4 am. Large portions, good side options, cool atmosphere as well. The pastrami burger with curly fries was awesome, great place to eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen.  Maybe I can say that because I don't wait tables there so am not obligated to wear shiny rayon tropical-print skort sets with shiny opaque flesh-toned pantyhose, but that was all part of the fun. 

I wanted a savory omelet and a sweet doughy blueberry muffin.  I got my savory omelet and a sweet doughy blueberry muffin.  My life is perfect; how about yours?"}
{"text":"My husband & I come to this place quite often because it's close to our house. You can get pretty much anything you want 24/7. Atmosphere is tacky but it's on purpose. The portions of food are huge.....definitely could be shared! For some reason they wouldn't let us order carry out over the phone for breakfast, had to do it in person. I'm not sure if it's like that all the time or just at breakfast. However, service is always good when eating there."}
{"text":"First late night meal in Vegas when we arrived a couple weeks ago. My friend had gone previously and told us that it was a yummy place to go with huge portions. I wasn't sure what to order at first but, then I decided on a caprese sandwich with french fries. I also ordered a pineapple and strawberry mimosa; now that was the shiiiiiz. The sandwich was packed with pesto, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. The bread was a nice toasty, crusty ciabatta full of flavor; nice and chewy too. I also tried some of my friend's buffalo wings! That was so delicious. The chicken wings and drumsticks were super meaty and not like those tiny ones you might get at other places. The ranch was good and didn't taste like it came straight out the bottle. I definitely need to go back to try the rest of the menu. I thought the decor was cute and kitschy.  Bright neon lights with cute trees inside the restaurant. It was a very 1960s super groovy, swinging good time! Seven thumbs up~"}
{"text":"There must be places in Vegas that'll serve you a large, well-made Sunday brunch without the half hour wait we had here -- which, thanks to the multiplicative powers of I-15 traffic, probably delayed our arrival home a hour and a half. Still, the queue aside, there was little to fault. My bacon and eggs were very satisfying, and the third of someone's Joe's Special I ended up having was nearly as good. Coffee was drinkable, near Starbucks quality (that's sort of a compliment)."}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Outstanding traditional fare menu with fair pricing.  Meal was delicious.  Will definitely return here after following locals recommendations."}
{"text":"If you have ever gone to Encounters at LAX, you will instantly get a similar vibe with this place.  It has a retro-look with neon lighting and faux cherry blossoms (if you ever go, you'll know what I mean).

A bit of advice if you intend to eat at Peppermill... come hungry.  It's fairly expensive for a diner-like restaurant, but it makes up for it in its ridiculously huge portions for most of its dishes.  I have never seen so many people have to request take-out boxes before.

I ordered a philly cheesesteak (since I wasn't actually all that hungry), which was good, but nothing too special.  My parents ordered a beef kabob (which was pretty tasty) and a walnut creek salad (which had a pesto dressing that just didn't agree with me)."}
{"text":"i was not expecting much from this restaurant but i was wrong. it was a cold day in vegas and we visited the restaurant which was packed. so i figured it must be good. got on the waiting list and took a seat in the lounge. w o w. beautiful space. there is a firepit in there that warms you right up. dark atmosphere which i like. we waited about 20 mins. was greeted by a server in the lounge almost immediately. ordered a drink while we waited. they have damn good strawberry daquiris!! me and the boyfriend shares an entree and it was great. an employee? came by and asked if we wanted a complimentary picture taken and printed for us and i thought it was a joke because she looked like a zombie and had no markings to show she was an employee. strange theyd have her representing their business weirding customers out"}
{"text":"Awesome place on the strip.  The decor is retro but really cool.  Food was awesome.  Pastrami was really good and nachos are huge.  Get yourself a colossal sundae before you go!!"}
{"text":"Have been coming to Vegas since 1983. Everytime we come we always head to the Peppermill for breakfast, any time of the day.

Still dark and dated, but its kind of nice to find the expected in such a constantly changing town. It is down towards Circus Circus and Stratosphere.

Service is good, wait staff is friendly and attentive.

Food is good. Ordered my usual ham and cheese omelet. It was huge and absolutely stuffed with ham and cheese. A very generous portion of crispy hash brown and toast came with it.

We will be back."}
{"text":"Once again the Peppermill doesn't disappoint. Newly married right down the street on good ol' 4th of July and LOCALS, we hit the Peppermill for a cocktail and breakfast. The lounge is awesome and relaxing, dark and cozy and private, too. Waitress came right over when we sat down by the fire pit (which is a little warm even at 10:30 am in early July in Vegas) so we relocated. No big deal. There are tons of people waiting to eat here and that means it's good! The girls and guys who work here have always been fantastic at what they do. I think our server Crystal has been there for years and was fantastic! I do my best to try something new when I have the pleasure/torture of going on the Strip but still stick with old favorites here. Joe's San Fran special and southern fried steak were so perfect and huge we took the left over deliciousness home. Find a lot of pics of them already so I didn't need to give you more of the same. Last couple of trips here have been for breakfast but in years past lunch/dinner menu items were great as well. Have no fear about your experience at this special place to visit/eat/drink & party in Vegas. Should say 'World Famous' on the sign but I'm pretty sure everyone knows that already."}
{"text":"Expect a huge lineup if you want to swing by Peppermill for brunch! Our party of two had to wait at least 20 minutes for a table - there's plenty of seating in the wait area and the hostess announces your name into a microphone so you'd hear that your table's ready even if you're standing outside.

I felt like I stepped into the past, the retro themed ambiance made the dining experience even more memorable. I still remember my shock at the size of the pancakes when it arrived at the table. So, I thought \"okay, the portion sizes here are impressive\". Then I took a bite and this is hands down the fluffiest pancake I've ever had! 

My Maserati Omelette was also enormous - I wouldn't be surprised if they used a whole carton of eggs to make this beauty. It was amazing! 

We could not finish out food, and the bill was less than $30 per person after tax and tip! I will definitely stop by Peppermill every time I visit Las Vegas! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Walking into The Peppermill is like walking into a lounge on a cruise ship. (Think mirrors, neon lights, palm trees, and flamingos.) If the tables were bolted to the floor, you'd swear you were on the S.S. Celebration. And that's a good thing, in my book.

When we first moved to Vegas in the late '90s, we would bring every out-of-town guest here. I'm not sure when that tradition fell by the wayside, but it's time to reinstate it.

Although we probably haven't been back in five years or more, nothing has changed since my first visit. Same gaudy decor. Same '70s music. Same great diner food. And, as far as I can tell, same prices. It may be a bit steeper than other places in town, but the prices are a steal for the Strip and the portions are so huge that you can pull two or even three meals out of one entree.

That was certainly the case for my Cobb salad, which was just as big -- and delicious -- as I remember it. I ate a quarter of it for dinner and had leftovers for three more meals! My husband ordered The Conquest, which is a glorified roast beef sandwich, with a side of onion rings. I think they may have changed the recipe on the rings -- they seem to be more panko-y and less beer batter-y -- and the portion seemed bigger than in the past. But they were great, and as I said before, they may be the only thing that's changed since 1998.

After dinner, we stopped in the lounge for a cocktail. Visiting the lounge is an event in itself. More mirrors, more neon, and a circular fire pit to entertain you and your date while you soak up the vibe. I usually get a mai tai, but I was so stuffed from dinner that I got something a little lighter: a Chambord lemon drop martini. It was a little sweet for my taste, but my husband's pineapple mojito was pretty tasty. And, once again, the prices were on par or lower than other bars on the Strip: less than $20 for both. 

Do yourself a favor and take a step back in time next time you're on the Strip. The Peppermill is open 24 hours, so this hot tub time machine is always ready for a party."}
{"text":"Today I went here for the first time since I was like.....7? 

I wonder, who ate the 70's and threw it all up in here? Fake trees, a lounge with a fire pit, pink and blue neon on the ceiling, red neon beneath the seats, tropically decorated menus.....it all reeks of a movie set for a porno from 1975. AWESOME.

Okay, now I was broke. I happened to be here with friends and all I could afford was a drink. I must say though, those breakfast plates looked rather delicious. Service was rather slow however.

I barely remember being here in my childhood, but after being all \"eh, whatever\" about it for years now I must go again. The unique tackiness of this place is so charming."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. When you come to Vegas do it right,and come to the Peppermill for breakfast. Customer service is Great! Food was fresh and awesome.We had the fresh fruit platter and eggs/hash-browns(shared).This confirmed portions are large. Peppermill allows the 80's continue to live on.....WoW"}
{"text":"Horrible don't waste the time and money. First, the decor looks like a 70's Miami nightclub. Picture the club from Scarface without a dance floor. The food was overpriced and simply defrosted and warmed up. Nothing was scratch made everything from the chicken fried steak to the cheesecake was processed and tasteless. The waiter was very friendly, as was most of all the staff. But to all tourists, beware. Go a half a block down to the taco bar and call it a night."}
{"text":"Don't you dare go to Vegas and not visit this place!  If you want to experience a real piece of Vegas history then this is it!  Huge portions at a good price and the Fireside Lounge is a really cool place to relax and have some drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"A classic homestyle cafe with lots of seating. Price to portion is a super bargain. Prepare to share, cause you won't be able to finish anything by yourself, with 10 in our party we were seated together after a brief wait during which we relaxed in the bar area which has a throwback 60's feel. The booths surround water/ fire pits . Cozy!
Our table ordered omelets,biscuits and gravy, eggs Benedict, French toast, blueberry and cranberry muffins, pancakes, mimosas, Bloody Mary! Rave reviews all around. Gigantic portions, quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Stopped by the morning of Blink182's Las Vegas Residency for some breakfast. Plenty of free parking but the wait took forever. Considered leaving after almost an hour of waiting but figured other places would be the same. My girlfriend and I had our breakfast brought to us fairly quickly. The atmosphere was nice and we both enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great food. There ought to be a shuttle bus from the heart of the strip just so people can get away from the lousy buffets and Denny's."}
{"text":"Una carta extensa en uno de los restaurantes más vistosos de Las Vegas!!! Una carta con buena comida (excelentes hamburguesas), desayunos y cenas! Los camareros son muy amables (como casi todos en EEUU, esperando una buena propina) Cuando nosotros estuvimos fue gracioso porque estaban rodando un capitulo para una serie de televisión mientras nosotros comíamos! Deliciosa la hamburguesa con pastrami."}
{"text":"Campy, old-school Vegas!

The restaurant is fine; sort of an up-scale Denny's. 
The real reason to go is the Fireside Lounge.
Try to get a seat in the fire-pit (it only seats 8)

Order a Scorpion Bowl and an appetizer plate, and take a step back in time. Food is average, drinks are good, but it's all about the ambience - and frankly, it's one of the cheapest decent eateries on the Strip."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place we went with a big group on a Sunday night with a reservation...but this place sucks!!! Waited 45 minutes to be seated got sat ordered over and waited an hour still no food asked our server he said two  minutes. We just keep seeing people getting served food who came after us. Very very bad service talked to the manager food still never came whole party walked out after about two hours."}
{"text":"I love the Peppermill! 

My parents and I would drive up to the old San Jose location from Santa Cruz when I was a kid. I love that they still have the rainbow sugar. Peppermill is so nostalgic for me! The lights, the trees, the food! The filet is always fantastic and I LOVE their cream of mushroom soup! Ahh, it's the best!"}
{"text":"This is a regular stop at least a couple times every visit. The menu is huge almost tonight but it provides something for everyone and it's still quality food. Along with the quality you get a old Vegas feel inside the restaurant with it's very neat decore."}
{"text":"The Peppermill has been a favorite of my family for YEARS, my father introduced me to this place for breakfast. The prices are acceptable, but be warned this place can get PACKED on the weekend for breakfast. The décor is old school Vegas, mirrors, neon, and fake flowers. After trying the lunch and dinner items I can say everything comes in generous portions and a decent diner flavor."}
{"text":"I'm hungry for Breakfast (Peppermill), I'm hungry for lunch (Peppermill), I'm hungry for dinner (Peppermill), It's 3am and I'm hungry, yep (Peppermill). 

Think of Denny's or your local coffee shop/diner kicked up 100% with hearty dishes and oversized portions and you get the Peppermill..... Click here to see what else Chef Reilly recommends and t"}
{"text":"We went to this place on a recommendation.  It was on the opposite end of the strip (by Circus Circus) from where we were staying, but it was worth the trip.  The place looks a little skeptical from the outside, like an old Denny's that they \"jazzed\" up...but the food was good and the portions were large.  I like the \"cheesey\" decor on the inside as well as the cheesey waitress uniforms.  Definitely seems like something you should experience in Vegas."}
{"text":"neon! mirrors! neon! fake gaslamps! fire that comes out of a pool of water!"}
{"text":"Cheap, good food. Bloody Mary and French toast are huge and amazing. Had our picture taken for free and were offered larger sizes. Even though we declined to purchase, they still gave a small photo. Wait staff was polite and timely. Definitely will be back. Inside is very vegas. Neon purple and pink diner. Very cool. Off the strip & 20 minute walk from our hotel (the Venetian) but was well worth it."}
{"text":"If I could give an award to the best restaurant to go to after a long night after the club, The Peppermill would win hands down.  The interior feels like a strip club (with it's cheesy pink neon lights) so it's only fitting to come here for breakfast to complete your drunken club nights.

The service here is friendly, but the food is what steals the show.  Not only are the portions huge, but the food is surprisingly very good.  I've only had breakfast items both times I was here, but It's much better quality ingredients and better taste than any other breakfast place or diner I've been.  Both times, I've had a omelete and they were delicious.  I even opted for egg whites which they'll happily substitute for a slight up charge.

I plan on coming back soon to try their salads and dessert-inspired cocktails that they are known for."}
{"text":"The tale of two places... The Peppermill and its Fireside lounge.  The peppermill is a corny \"Las Vegas\" feelin' ihop-like diner.  Kinda cheesy, decent food.  The Fireside lounge, on the other hand, is where the pimps be. lol.  Its really nice, swanky (I've never used that word but so many other reviewers did so I had too) and dark.  Perfect place to take someone who has NEVER BEEN there before. Many ohs and ah's, The perfect spot for taking a date or a date on the DL.  It was better w/out the tv's everywhere but its still dope. BUT: drinks are expensive (Vegas) and No hats!  Weird, I know... but they always get me on this. I have filmed commercials and tv shows there with full crew and they still make me take my hat off. Damnit.

CLIFFNOTES: If you've never been. GO"}
{"text":"There is something so intriguing as a stand alone restaurant on the Strip. Over the decades, bits and pieces of stand alones (stores, cafes, smaller casinos) have been plucked from the ground like weeds. I think it is a good thing for Vegas's economy but I also feel that something should be preserved, maybe that's why I have always liked this place.  I have a fondness for Peppermill because it is as old as I am, we were both born in 1972. 

On my most recent visit, I bought a friend for brunch before I ran him to the airport. As soon as we were seated he mentioned that it reminded him of diners in Jersey where he grew up. I felt I made an excellent choice because nostalgia is always a good thing! We decided to split the enormous pancakes and Joe's San Francisco Special. We also ordered coffees and of course this cocktail darling couldn't resist one of their glorious Bloody Mary's! 

The portions are huge so it may be a good idea to split it or know you will have breakfast food leftovers for awhile! The Joe's SF Special was like a huge platter of \"stuff\"... Eggs, ground beef, sausage, spinach, Potato, cheese all together. It was pretty awesome and comforting. The pancakes are huge! When the serving platter was placed on the table my friend exclaimed \"What's this?\". Uh those are pancakes my friend. I really want to meet the spatula that flips those pancakes. Do they use two arms to flip it? I'm pondering but need to finish up here. The Bloody Mary! Get one. They are beautiful and yummy, especially needed for a Vegas brunch!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hilton near the convention center and needed a few items so I headed to the local walgreens. After gathering my belongings I looked up restaurants nearby and yelp recommended The Peppermill. Me and my significant other decided to give it a try. 

Upon entering we were happily greeted by a 70's diner like atmosphere. We were promptly seated and had a super happy bubbly waitress who offered us some of the best service I've ever had at a restaurant. She was on top of her game the entire time! 

I ordered the cheese sticks and nachos for an appetizer. The cheese sticks were pretty good but the nachos were out of this world! They were HUGE! (And extremly tasty.) I ordered the peppermill breakfast combo (pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage) and it was excellent. WAY better than a Denny's or chain. The pancakes were thick and hearty. My significant other ordered the salmon and loved it! We ended the night with the brownie and ice cream which was absolutely to die for! 

We enjoyed the restaurant so much we came back for a second round! We ordered Wings, breakfast food and a sandwich (I can't remember the name) with roast beef, thousand island and a few other things which sort of resembled a reuben. We were completely satisfied with both meals and are going to miss this place when we leave! 

If you are looking for amazing food, a great atmosphere, A+ service and a bill that won't leave your pockets empty, I HIGHLY recommend The Peppermill!"}
{"text":"Love, loved this restaurant for breakfast! Beware the portions are extremely big! I had an omelet and I split it with my daughter and even then we still had a lot left over. He staff was all very pleasant and we had multiple workers come to our table to take care of us. Not one person in my family of 7 was disappointed."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I went here the first time by mistake. I came with my ex back in 2012 and we wanted to get a decent steak for our anniversary but it was around 2am so the majority of the high end steak places were closed. I was pretty excited when I saw a steak place that was open 24 hours. We rolled into Peppermill thinking it would be a quiet fireside grill. And we got Miami vice meets old school Vegas party diner. To be honest I was not very happy. Once I got over not getting what I expected we had a really good time. The food was great, the wait staff was on point, and the atmosphere was super fun. I have been several times since. I went last weekend and I had the same experience as usual. The waitresses are incredibly sweet. One of them was even helping a patron eat that had some sort of muscular dystrophy. It really warmed my heart to see that. Overall an amazing fun place to get some good food."}
{"text":"I stumbled in the Peppermill on the advice of others, they said you can't miss this place if you're in Vegas. I have to agree, this is a great place if you like kitchy decor and great food. I ordered a simple Denver omelet... was I ever surprised when they brought my breakfast out, it was the size of a small meat loaf. It was a good thing that Nan and I had planned to split it because I would have been hard pressed to have done it justice. And it was delicious! Our dining companions had similar luck with their meal, and they had originally ordered one for each of them. 

Did I mention the kitchy decor? It just screamed 50s, Elvis and vinyl upholstery. If I had more time I would have liked to have photographed the place, but if I had all I would have gotten was pictures of people eating magnificently huge meals. The line to get in got longer and longer as we worked thru our meals. 

This is an iconic spot with good food, generous portions and great service. Don't miss it."}
{"text":"I've been here many times before, I come every time I come to Vegas. This time was different. Our server was so great! Hiromi was attentive and very pleasant. We ordered the French toast, the crab cake Benny, and the steak an eggs and a pancake. Everything was average, what you would expect from a diner, but the steak was hard plastic rubber! Dry as a bone whit absolutely no flavor at all. The two stars are for her service. Which was the opposite to the food quality."}
{"text":"Love the fire pits it's definitely a place to go and relax and chill make sure you go without your problems.  This is the perfect atmosphere to de stress yourself"}
{"text":"Sit by the fire sip on a drink and cuddle by your honey!"}
{"text":"Great location. Great Food. Great Price!!
If you're tired of paying 80 bucks on the strip for lunch, check out this place. 
Service is quick, portions are MASSIVE and prices are extremely reasonable. Been coming here for a few years now and have had a variety of items on their menu and it's always been delicious. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This is an old favorite of mine. I have had at least one breakfast meal here for every time I've been in Las Vegas (50+ times). The ambiance is a lot of fun, the waitresses all tend to be nice, and I barely eat half my meal, but it has yet to disappoint me. I think it is truly a go-to place for the experience, if nothing else!"}
{"text":"A locals spot! The chicken wings and breakfast are amazing. I go here after my late night poker sessions for some munchies. They are open 24/7 which is super convenient."}

{"text":"While in Las Vegas for a Wisconsin Badger football game myself and Brianna L decided to walk the what seemed like 3000 miles from the Monte Carlo to the north end of the Strip to eat at Peppermill when our flight got in at 11pm.

The other reviews are correct when they describe the atmosphere.  Purple, red and pink neon lights the place dimly while pretty big cherry blossom trees stick out of the floor up to the ceilings.  The booths are pretty much all circular in shape and are soft and plush.

I ordered the Ranchero Omlette and wow was it big.  Brianna L ordered the cheese quesadillas and we could've easily split either of these dishes.  Both were excellent in presentation and taste.  I had a Tequila Sunset and Brianna had a big blue drink that was pretty tasty.

Cool place that isnt new Vegas-y at all.  Friendly young women waitresses was the cherry on top for this great place to eat."}
{"text":"Found through Yelp (although I've been passing it for years).  Enormous omlettes that are suitable for sharing.  Crowded for breakfast.  Service was good.  Breakfast prices were about $10 to $15 per person.  It is really \"Old Vegas.\"  We'd go again."}
{"text":"This place belongs in Vegas! Went for breakfast at 8 am and walked into a disneyworld like set up with shiny stainless steel, pink and purple velvet wall trimmings and flamingo stainglass lights. The sugar is even multicolored and the coffee cups are the size of a small thermos. Breakfast is huge too. We got one of the specials with spanish sausage, onions, peppers cooked with hashbrowns and fresh eggs and cheese. Yummy! The bar has this absolutely cool fire place/water pool thing you have to check out. Oh, and of course you can get a bloody mary or strawberry daquiri if your inclined. Would of been more stars but no options under 11$ for a breakfast is a bit steep."}
{"text":"So,  i believe that the bartender is new. Michael . very personable and engaging! Payed very close attention to my drinks.

I will definitely return"}
{"text":"We had breakfast there. 45 min wait for 2 persons, mid morning. We went to the bar and had crab cakes with roasted red pepper sauce, very tasty. We ate breakfast, huge portions and we took some home. Very kitschy decor, fake fliers and trees. The staff uniforms were straight from the 70's. Friendly staff. Not an intimate setting, noisy."}
{"text":"Fast, great service & the BEST Eggs Benedict I've ever had. My hubby got the club sandwich with fries & the fries are amazing, hot & crispy. Don't miss this breakfast/lunch gem. It is SO good!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time last night.  The place has this great 80's neon feel to it, I liked it.  Music was kinda weird as it was some 80's, some newer stuff.

The server was great, and they also had a cocktail waitress for drinks (kind of odd, but a beer's a beer.)  

We knew we would have leftovers so we ordered the Sampler to add to the \"next day meal.\"  It is a giant plate of fried food.  Chicken tenders, cheese sticks, shrimp, and GIANT onion rings.  If I had a complaint, it would be the onion rings are too big.  Also with the mass of grease is a few pieces of Bruschetta.  Thet were good, but the tomatoes seemed as if they had been marinating too long, kinda squishy.

Dinner, I had the Ciabatta Pesto Burger.  Beef, Ciabatta bread, pesto, red onion, tomato, pancetta, fresh mozzarella, and instead of lettuce.... a crapload of basil leaves.  This is now one of the top 5 burgers I have ever had in my life.  Srsly, this burger blew me away.  The beef was \"ok,\" nothing that amazing, but the combination of the pesto, basil, pancetta, and fresh mozzarella... you (yes, you) NEED to try this.

The appetizers and service were a 4 star.  That burger makes the entire experience 5 stars.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Came here late night a few nights ago and was really impressed. First of all they are open 24hrs which is awesome especially when you are partying all night. The place is really big and always pretty crowed which says something in itself. The staff is extremely friendly and very patient which is a plus. The food is great and they give you really big portions so come with an appetite. Overall the Peppermill was a great discovery for me and i would highly recommend it to any one looking for a late night or early morning eats."}
{"text":"place is awesome...been there a few times....big portions, really good food...incredible atmosphere...it's a Vegas institution for a reason.   I got the poached eggs over crab cakes, amazing hash browns and a side of bacon, a bloody mary...oh yeah and a slice of carrot cake... last night at like 3am......RIDICULOUS GOOD."}
{"text":"We first came to the Fireside Lounge just before Halloween. I had read about this place in the Nevada AAA travel book. It is not as upscale and modern as places in the Bellagio or elsewhere, but we were not expecting it to be. I was delighted with the decor and found it very comfy, cozy, intimate and fun. The AAA travel book said they the waitresses would \"treat you like big shots\" but they did not, and that was OK too. But our waitress was prompt and friendly. They have some really cool huge drinks, and we saw a HUGE plate of nachos on the table next to us. We ordered some appetizers and they weren't gourmet or anything but they were fine. Prices are better than most lounges we've been to on the strip. We sat in a cozy corner but next time I'd like to sit by the fireplace.

Then we went to the Peppermill Restaurant on Thanksgiving Day. We were well aware that this holiday dinner was not all-you-can-eat and that was perfectly fine with us. We made reservations but there were plenty of available tables. We also told our waitress we would take advantage of their senior citizen discount on the Thanksgiving Dinner. I ordered the key lime martini which was fabulous. Love that the rim of the glass is covered in graham cracker crumbs. The Thanksgiving dinner was excellent and was as tasty as a good homemade Thanksgiving feast. We had driven across country and loved that everything tasted homemade.  It exceeded our expectations. Our waitress went off shift and another came to take care of us the rest of the meal.

Now here comes the problem and why I only gave a 4 star rating. When we went to pay, the cashier snapped at us that there was no discount on the Thanksgiving dinner. So I promptly picked up the little Thanksgiving dinner flyer on the hostess desk behind me and showed her that it was in writing about the senior discount. Well, then she huffed, \"you're supposed to tell your waitress when you are seated.\" We told the cashier that we did tell our waitress we wanted the senior discount but we had a change of waitresses during our meal. So then she had to leave the cash register to confer with our waitress and manager or whoever and came back and took our money. No \"thank you for dining with us\" or \"have a nice holiday\" or anything. Nothing. Just a pissy attitude. Here we had had a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and then had to battle this old bitty. Because it was a holiday and I didn't want to ruin my husband's day, I didn't argue with her over her bad attitude or ask for the manager. Had I pushed the issue, we probably could have gotten a comp or something for her being so rude. We left. 

I would go back to the Fireside in a heartbeat, but probably not the Peppermill. They lost our business and that is too bad because we love the Fireside. I just don't want to risk a bad experience there again with another employee."}
{"text":"I love this place. I like to go whenever I'm in town. Last time I visited, I got all decked out in an evening gown, just to go have dinner here and go to Fremont afterwards. Because Vegas.

It's tacky-in-a-fun-way, gaudy-glam, neon, old-style Vegas and I love it. Lots of purples, pinks and turquoise. There can be a wait, depending on when you go, but it's worth it, in my opinion. Quick note-- if you are a person of larger proportion, the booths can be a bit of a squeeze. My ex-husband did NOT care for that when we went. 

The food runs pretty much the lines of good diner food, and the portions are HUGE. 

There's also a large bar menu, and the Scorpion is a fun fishbowl-sized drink to share. We also had another drink that tasted fantastic-- I swear it was called \"Bathtub\" or \"Bathtime\" something, but I have to apologize-- after that Scorpion, my notes got a liiiiiittle fuzzy.

I CAN, however, tell you the Nachos, Nachos, Nachos were MOUNTAINOUS and very tasty. We opted to add the ground beef and it actually came on top (not on the side as the menu stated) but we didn't care (see aforementioned Scorpion) and enjoyed them immensely. 

Oh, and at some point, someone will come and take your picture and then offer to sell you a package, but they always give you a cute little print for free, so that's a nice souvenir. I highly recommend you check this place out. Great place to grab a bite to eat, any time of day."}
{"text":"Diner-lightful.  It is a must do for anyone visiting Vegas. Every time we go and there is a Peppermill virgin among us we all walk in and wait for the reaction.  The food is also tasty the drinks delish and the cocktail lounge after dinner is a must.  

Not to mention the place runs 24 hours - which is a bonus!  Add it to your Vegas list and enjoy."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was old enough to start visiting Vegas so this place has a lot of memories for me. (Sitting around the table with a bunch of friends at 4am digging into a MOUNTAIN of nachos.) 
     Now I only get to visit once a year, since I no longer live just a few hours from Vegas. Some visits have been better than others for sure, but I don't think I've ever walked out unhappy. This time I had the Mediterranean omelet ($14), which was good and the creme brulee ($7), which was OK.

The Good:
Not only was the omelet huge but more importantly it was good. There was plenty of pretty good quality shrimp and a fair dose of crab. The Hollandaise sauce was flavorful and complimented it well without taking away from the flavor of the shrimp and crab.

The Bad:
The only complaint, and it's not a severe one, is the waitress didn't do a very good job of keeping up with our drinks. It was just bad enough to be annoying, not bad enough to be frustrating.

The Indifferent:
The hash browns that came with the omelet were fairly unremarkable but I have to warn you, while I will eat them, I'm not a huge fan of hash browns so you might want to take my opinion on this with a little caution. 
     While I don't really expect much from creme brulee, I have had a couple that I really savored. This one wasn't in that category, while it was good enough it wasn't any better or worse than the average."}
{"text":"The BEST: if you're in Vegas, you must stop by the Peppermill. Great service,  reasonable prices,  and huge portions."}
{"text":"\"Good diner with easy access\"

Service - 8 out of 10 (very fast service)
Location - 8 out of 10 (easy free parking and safe area)
Food Quality - 8 out of 10 (very large portions)
Price - 7 out of 10 (not too bad for LV)

This is above average place for a quick meal in LV. The servers are nice and everything I've had there was good. The only complaint I have is the outrageous prices for basic drinks. (Tea 2.50, milk 3.00) This is not just a peppermill thing... all of LV thinks any drink is worth a fortune. (Bottle beers are 7.50 in most places)

Overall this is a great place!

PS: No hats in the Fireside Lounge."}
{"text":"After reading mixed reviews, I decided I wanted to try this place out anyways.

Came here late last night with my boyfriend. The setup and decorations were pretty neat.

After opening my menu, all that ran through my mind was \"Denny's food but double the price,\" so I expected the food to be good.. Or at least somewhat decent.. Wrong. We ordered the sampler to share, and neither one of us liked a single thing from the sampler, if you want cheaper and better diner food, go to Denny's or iHop.

Two stars because our server was very nice, and inside was cool. Food was not good at all."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast / Brunch spot!  Lots of tasty options and I love the neon and decor!"}
{"text":"OMG FANTASTIC!! The French toast was soooooo gooood...I special ordered it with just bananas and strawberries, the idea of grapes and melon on French Toast didn't sit right with me. We ate there two days in a row. Both days we sat at the counter because the wait was 20-30+ minutes. They have giant coffee cups which was great - no waiting for refills. Atmosphere is great - old school neon and such. You can even have a cocktail with breakfast. Go it is work the wait."}
{"text":"I thought this place was kind of lame. We went on a Sat night from like 11pm-1am and it was kind of dead. The lounge had enough people to take up the chairs around the 1 fire pit they had but besides that, pretty much no one. The food if I may quote another yelper is like overpriced Denny's food. The service sucked in both the restaurant  and lounge. So in the restaurant they have the food runner ask your drink order but if you order alcohol then the waitress has to take that order. I guess the food runner's not allowed to serve alcohol or she just wasn't old enough to serve alcohol I'm assuming. Anyhow, that was kind of annoying. Not too mention the waitress took forever to actually come over to take that order, then forgot a drink. The lounge sucked too. Kind of dirty as in the couches you sit on and the floor. We went in and sat ourselves and waited and waited but no one asked if we wanted drinks. So I went to the bar and ordered our drinks which were kind of pricey and didn't have much alcohol in them. As I pull out my lil wad of money I could see the cocktail waitress standing to the left of the bar eyeballing and giving me a dirty look. Probably cause I went to the bar myself but hey, if you snooze you loose chick. Should have taken our order when we walked in. I gave em 2 stars cause it wasn't horrible and since it does serve food 24 hours a day. I just didn't feel it was worth my money or time. I really not sure why they have 4 stars on yelp. Maybe their breakfast is good I guess.  I more then likely won't be coming back unless I can't get any late night food somewhere else Vegas. Then maybe I'd think about it."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant.  First of all colored sugar at the table!  Woo-hoo!  The kids loved it....okay, so did the parents. The decor inside with the neon lights were very cool too.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive; the cocktail waitress was also wonderful.  A photographer came by to take a complimentary photo of the family.  We received a free 3x5 photo and had the option to buy 8x10, but didn't.  The free one was perfect!  The food was pretty good and we were very pleased.  The portion size was pretty huge, so we were able to take it back to our hotel.

Great place!"}

{"text":"Excellent service. Great vibe for a Vegas restaurant. 

Good was really good and onion rings were crispy and delicious. 

Feels like an old Big Boy restaurant but mite lively and Vegas like. 

Recommended!!"}
{"text":"Tons of food.  Kind wait staff. Off the beaten path of the strip so fewer dumb spring breakers and irritating tourists.  Great food. I can see why Floyd mayweather and Penn Jillette love this place"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat after going out at night and needing some good food to put an end to a night of imbibing.  Also working at night in a locale where dozens of people ask where to eat at this hour (2 or 3 am usually), I have never in 8 years had one person come back and complain about the Peppermill.  That by itself should say something in an era when complaints seem the norm.

Food portions are generous and prices are reasonable compared to what else is open nearby at \"off\" hours."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend the food because the Denny's-style menu does not look appetizing to me, so I've never actually sat down in the restaurant.  

But I enjoy the Fireside Lounge.  The neon-lit interior gives it a swanky atmosphere.  It's a casual place to hang out with friends or bring a date after dinner.  All kinds of interesting people come here.  

The service is all right and the drinks are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Awesome place for brekky and great service. Only downside is the wait to get a seat as the place is so popular ! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place! It's still decorated in that \"old Vegas\" style with neon and mirrors everywhere. Very cool looking place! The food is outstanding and they serve a full menu 24 hours a day. The portions are large and very filling. It's a decent value considering how much food you get here. I would definitely recommend not missing out on The Peppermill whenever you are in town!"}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone can go to Vegas and not stop by the Peppermill for at least a cocktail in the lounge. This place looks like a cross between a 70's Blacksploitation film and the Madonna Inn. We got there at peak breakfast time (11:30) so you literally could not get in the joint. We had to wait for about 20 minutes. We almost knocked over some old people tryin' to grab a seat at the counter. The food is not cheap but the portions are ample and it's good, basic food. 
The lounge is the place to be, however. There ain't nothin' like sippin' a cocktail in the fire pit! Hopefully fickle Vegas will never tear this place down!!"}
{"text":"The food is great! I've been coming here for years but yesterday was a very different experience. The bartender treated my family and I like chopped liver after we PAID ahead of getting my food which was a strange option she gave us when we first walked in the bar area. After payment was collected we were completely ignored, we had to beg another bartender for service. Our assigned bartender was in complete avoidance of our table which was extremely rude."}
{"text":"Awesome decor, good prices, OK food, spotty service.

My girlfriend and I had dinner at the Fire Side Lounge.  Walking in, we saw a sign saying \"No hats allowed,\" and they mean it (another couple had to leave when the woman refused to take off her ball cap).  We sat on the comfortable couch by the fire. (Very nice!) and had our drink and food order taken quickly.  The food was OK but on the greasy side.  When it came to getting another round, the waitress was nowhere to be seen.  We flagged another one who indicated she would be right with us (she never came back), but it was near 15 minutes until someone was able to take our order.

Overall, a good place to relax, enjoy a drink, and to have a small bite.  The service issue won't dissuade me from coming back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best overall place to eat on the Strip. Peggy n the crew are awesome, the food rocks but be ready to eat. The portions and service are over the top.  My favorite place on the blvd!!"}
{"text":"Remember those nights when you were absolutely gone and coming back from a club and needing some type of sustenance? Remember when you would hit up Denny's and wreak havoc on their menus, staff and bathrooms? Well, when you're in Vegas, fuck Denny's. Peppermill is here.

I don't know what kind of theme this place is going for. Everything about it screams cum stained strip club from the velvet seats to the neon ceiling lighting. I mean everytime I come here I seriously am anticipating fog to come out of one of the planters and up comes up Trixie the Tranny to start dancing. It's just reaaallly weird to be in this place but it's so exciting! Like I said, the place itself looks like a strip club, but the menus and the theme are completely different. I guess it's just bad marketing ideas for whatever they're trying to pull off.

Aside from the decor, the food is fantastic. Big plates of just pure American feast. And if you didn't know already, when you order their omelettes or anything with eggs, they use 10 eggs. Yeah. TEN. The hash browns are perfection. I highly doubt you'll ever finish your food, but if you do, you should enter yourself in an Eating Competition. And when you do finish your food, make sure there's a bathroom nearby that you can destroy. On top of all this, the staff is really nice! Kick ass staff and kick ass food in a kick ass strip club! Kick ass!"}
{"text":"Food tasted like we walked into Denny's next door on accident. Pancakes and eggs were very disappointing."}
{"text":"There are 1125 reviews for a reason
In this industry (22 years and counting) and especially in this city, it is truly rare when you get amazing service, amazing food in a comfortable, warm, clean atmosphere
If I could give 6 stars to our server, Angela, I would. She gave me the best service I have received in this city (2 years) and I have worked and managed some of the best restaurants, bars and clubs
Ill be back again and again
Thank you Peppermill"}
{"text":"Warning: Well I love this place, but warning I've seen at least 12 people fall entering the flaming jacuzzi area. ... It reminds me of a Denny's slash limo in one - my favorite is capreses ciabiatta burger, vegetarian meal.  Excellent with sweet potatoe fries.  Of course with a dirty martini grey goose 3 olive."}
{"text":"Walking distance from Circus Circus, open 24/7, and awesome food in portions that can satisfy your fattest friends. We found Peppermill by asking one of the security guards in the Circus Circus casino where we can eat at 1:30 in the morning, and he recommended this place. I halfway expected to see strippers inside, sort of like the breakfast/brunch bars in Portland. (the building is lit with blue neon) Instead, we got a really cool restaurant where the servers were friendly, and moderately dressed, by Vegas standards at least. We were seated promptly, and within five minutes, our food orders were taken, our bar orders were fulfilled by a different waitress/bar girl, and our sodas and waters were refilled. I swear, I think we were helped by at least six different people, and usually at this time of night, most places are running on skeleton crews. I ordered the ribs, which were amazing, and my friends got the alfredo, corned beef meal and steak, all of which looked flippin delicious. And the level of service was FANTASTIC, especially when you consider what we spent, and the time of night. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Huge portions! The chicken with red pepper and creamy sauce was fantastic! Our waitress Samatha, was awesome! The salmon was a little dry, but everything else was fabulous! Huge sampler app! Great atmospheric!!"}
{"text":"Tropical cocktails in colored pictures and in massive glass globes, pink neons lights cast strange shadows on the faux foliage, gilded mirrors makes the room look like a ballroom while the cocktail servers, clad in floor-length ball gowns and soft sex voices, sashay around the bubbling fire pit. 

Strange place. But yes, I still take every one of my out-of-town friends here. Every single one."}
{"text":"Food is great, atmosphere is great. This is where you come in the middle of the night for some delicious, hugely portioned, well priced food. 

It is amazing for what it is."}
{"text":"Peppermill is awesome!!! The variety of selection is great. You can get  a nice BIG meal (all their portion size are huge 2 to 3 people can eat out of 1 plate) prixes are very affordable. Looking for a homey meal? This is the place!!"}
{"text":"My S.O. and I went here the other day after attending an awesome Shins concert at the Hardrock Hotel. I've been wanting to try Peppermill for a while now, especially with all the reviews. We talked to a few locals who were concert go-ers that night and they highly recommended that we head over to Peppermill.  

When you are driving there, just be aware that Peppermill is located somewhat off the strip by the Convention Center. It's next to a Ross and there is ample public parking.

We entered into Peppermill and it was like stepping into a cheezy night club/vegas dive bar/I really don't even know what. The decor is super cheezy and kitchy. I loved it.  It's definitely one of those \"you must experience it for yourself\" kind of places.

I ordered the eggs benedict per my fellow yelper's recommendations.  I loved the hollendaise sauce and the portion size was amazing. The hash browns were cooked a little longer than usual and they were crunchy and tasty.

The S.O. ordered a feta omelette and I'm not sure what kind of beast of a creation came out.  As the S.O. was eating his omelette, he said, \"Geeze, I'm getting full, I wonder how many eggs are in this thing?\" The waitress replied, \"Anywhere from 10-12 eggs.\" Holy heart attack, Batman! So what's the point you ask? Share, share, share!  The portions are plentiful here.

The service was also very friendly and great. The place was a little dead but I think that's only because it was a Thursday night.

If you are in Vegas and want a good late night dinner, I highly recommend Peppermill."}
{"text":"We now like stopping here when we stay in Vegas. A little off the strip with its own parking so you don't have to walk through a hotel. Great lounge area to hang out while waiting for your table to be ready or just grab cocktails. Food portions are large, well priced and most importantly tastes good! When we were there the first time we saw one of the ladies from Orange is the New Black there."}
{"text":"Amazing, attentive, and just down right smart staff. From the host, to the bartender James, to my waitress Natalie I was treated like this was my home. The lighting and energy is perfect. It has this classic Vegas vibe that I love. I'm just in town from Hollywood for the night to write. I was able to write two scenes in the Fire Lounge and the coffee was damn good. I would highly recommend this place, and the staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place. Very fun, retro experience. I had the French toast collage. Great portion size. French toast was nice and fluffy and Sausage are huge. Nice variety of options on the menu and cool drinks"}
{"text":"For white people food this place rocks. Big portions and good tasting stuff. The place looks sweet too which sets it.apart from Ihop. So give it a solid try and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a whim and I'm glad I did. I ordered the Lorraine Omelette which was large in size and flavor. It was served with some good home fries and wheat toast which I chose. The vibe is chill yet busy. Expect a wait because I can be very busy at times. When I'm back in town, I'll definitely stop back here again."}
{"text":"Outstanding atmosphere in the fireplace room and some heat food at decent prices.  My girlfriend and I heard about the size of the plates there, so we decided to only order 1 plate and it was well worth it.  Also while there we had a bloody Mary drink, it was just \"okay\" as it wasn't very spicy and didn't have a lot of alcohol in it, but the flavor of the tomato juice plus the garnishes made it more tolerable."}
{"text":"My family liked this place.  I did not.
I thought t was dirty and the service very poor.
My wife loved her omelette.  My kids their breakfasts.  I am not a breakfast guy, but evenso, the place was dirty and the service terrible.
I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow what an experience this breakfast was!!!  We stumbled on this gem while trying to find some food 'close' to our hotel before heading home.  From the minute we stepped inside we were awed by the organized chaos that was happening in every way.  The decor is hilarious and I loved it!  Mirrored ceiling tiles, fake plants everywhere you look, old school upholstery, neon lights, this place has it all.  
We were seated at the counter and as we order our cocktails we were told there would be a cocktail server around to help us.  What?  But sure enough a lady in a floor length black dress came by and quickly took our drink order before disappearing into the kitchen.  Then our food server came by  and did the rest of the work, very unique set up.  The restaurant was VERY busy on a Saturday morning and the staff was buzzing about trying to get everyone fed, paid and out the door.  We ordered the ham and eggs and the steak and eggs, everything was huge and pretty well done.  Unfortunately I had to leave about half of my breakfast since it was so large but now we know to share for next time."}
{"text":"Love it! It looks like a simple breakfast place. But, when you walk in , wow!!! It is like Vegas! Colorful, beautiful, and look at the bar! It has an electric blue fire with couches around it. Good food, and pretty fast even though most times there are a lot waiting."}
{"text":"We were there 07/29/12 at 930pm and the restaurant was full at the time. Big commotion at the booth next to us - they got up, screamed and ran away from the table. We looked over and saw a HUGE cockroach (approx 2 inches long) crawling across the seat of the booth. The manager quickly ushered those people out of the restaurant. I also asked to speak to the manager since we had just started eating and the manager was immediately defensive saying things like \"It didnt touch you\" & \"we're in Nevada, you know how it is\". During this time a few employees stood there, looked at the roach crawling around and walked away. Not one person cared enough to kill it or to apologize to those of us who saw it. The manager had no interest in hearing what I had to say or in trying to make the situation 'right', and actually told me \"You're not coming back here again anyway, so why should I bother to do anything\". SERIOUSLY?. Needless to say, our appetites were ruined, we sent the remainder (over 1/2 of each plate) of our food back and got stuck with a $55 bill. We should have walked out like the table on the other side of us."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, I recommend trying it at least once.  It's open 24 hours.  Everything on the menu is always available (late night menus not required).

The decor is a fusion between tropical theme and strip club.  The inside has a lot of tropical ambiance, but it is kept quite dark, with neon lights throughout.  The female waitresses are dressed in short shorts, but fully clothed on top.  It is not risque at all, so don't worry about bringing the kids (you shouldn't bring your kids to Vegas in the first place...please leave them at home, you are ruining my vacation!!!), but it's a nice sight for guys. 

I've mostly been here for breakfast, so I'm not sure about the lunches and dinners, but all of the breakfast items that I've tried have been very good.  My particular favorite is Munch's Breakfast.

The Fireside Lounge is a bar that is adjacent.  I believe it is a full bar.  Usually a cocktail waitress walks around the restaurant to take bar orders.

Peppermill is on the pricey side, but portions are very, very large to help make up for it.  2 people can definitely share one meal and both get full.

This is a place I like and go to it every time I'm in LV.  It may not be for everyone, but I think everybody should try it once.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot...their coffee sucks!"}
{"text":"This place is great! This is our second time here, we love it. I believe it'll be a spot to come for breakfast anytime we are in Vegas.  The food is fresh and delicious, I love the colored sugar (yeah, dumb I know). Portions are huge, if you're not a big water, 425 Fremont St, I will suggest you share and just add sides. The service is pretty fast considering that it's been super busy both times we've come."}
{"text":"This is a must-see if you're on the strip.  Totally classic Vegas style lounge.  Chintzy neon, fake plants, fireplaces make this the kind of place you just gotta see.  It's expensive though, so I gotta take a star off.  A gin and tonic should never be 8 bucks, even on top of the Eiffel Tower."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Vegas! I learned about it by watching a \"Holly's World\" episode but the more I mentioned it to friends, I realized I was out of the loop about this awesome spot! You could come here for any meal. I've enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant, drinks & appetizers in the lounge, and dinner in the lounge. It just depends on your mood. It's a kitschy vibe and reminds me of the Madonna Inn Hotel in San Luis Obispo so if you've ever been there I'd compare the two in terms of décor and vibe. The lounge is totally different - kind retro and I can't even tell you how much I love the fire/water features. I could probably hang out in there all day! I'd suggest you make a stop in there at some point on your Vegas visit!"}
{"text":"Since 1972 this has been a Las Vegas tradition...and I don't care who you are...you have to go here at least once...

Being vegan I still actually enjoy a good junk food midnight indulge every once in awhile...
And wow this is the place to do it...wow...
So WTF does a vegan order there? Not the yummy looking brushetta because it has cheese in it :)

Going light:  I get the TOMATO STACK CAPRESE STYLE 
Sliced ripe tomatoes layered with fresh Mozzarella, fresh basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil. With NO CHEESE of course.

Going for the full Monty: I get the CAPRESE STYLE CIABATTA. 
Toasted Ciabatta, fresh basil, Mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and pesto sauce, served with fresh fruit ambrosia.                                    With NO CHEESE of course. Oh and forget the fruit ambrosia lol I think it means marshmallows and it's not because the marshmallows are not vegan.......it's because I want their famous pound of french fries. 

Sounds healthy huh? But I don't care because you know what...those HUGE cocktails that they bring to me are not healthy either ;) 

Keep in mind that NEITHER of these items are available in the super duper Fireside Lounge area...just the diner side. But no worries just grab drinks in the Fireside and then head to the diner side...or reverse that situation!

So basically the once-in-a-blue-moon times that I come here I leave with 3/4 of a yummy meal and a belly full of yummy cocktails :) :) and I don't regret it...I think..."}
{"text":"Fun place!

We have lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and have heard people rave about the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside lounge for all 20 years -- but had never gone -- until yesterday. 

We had a friend staying at the Wynn and we decided to go out for lunch, and were not in the mood to pay the prices for drinks and food at the Wynn restaurants. None of us were able to agree on what kind of food we wanted so decided to go to the Peppermill as we always heard they had a huge eclectic menu.  We arrived a 1:20 on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed.  We had called in and put our name on the waiting list (no reservation taken for afternoons I was told) but still had about a 20 minute wait. The potpourri of clientele ranges from families, with grandmotherly types  to young fashionably cool model types and everything in between.

The decor is retro coffee shop on a bit of LSD... lots of neon and cool black light effects... quite an interesting breakfast spot!

I can't believe it took so long for us go there. So easy to get into.. no 6 level park garages and trudging through the casinos to get to a Strip eaterie.  Parking is easy and the menu is huge, with a lot of old American style standards, and also a few healthier alternatives if you scour the menu well.  The prices are very good and all three of us loved what we ordered. Our server (Destiny) was cute as can be, and very sweet as well as very efficient.

We had a nice bottle of wine and shared food and drink with each other and it was a treat. Christine had the Gourmet Shrimp Salad... with balsamic dressing...a really huge delicious salad, with fruit and avocado and some good sized shrimp. I had the pastrami burger with curly fries and our friend Maya had the Eggs Benedict.  We ordered a fudge brownie with ice cream for desert that that was huge and we didn't come close to finishing. Our total bill $104.

On the way out we checked out the Fireside Lounge which is a pretty sexy flashback to the late 70's early 80's with its hot pink furnishings and low profile seating around the fire pit... probably quite the pickup spot in the early morning hours... if the fire pit wasn't there a stripper pole would be a natural. :-)"}
{"text":"I always enjoy a trip to the Peppermill because, in the era of \"Blush,\" and \"Pure,\" this place is like a time capsule of swank. If you can get a seat fireside, then you have arrived. This last trip, we lucked out and scored a seat right by the fire pit, which is a rarity. The drinks are good (I had the Cherry Bomb) and the help is OK. There was a creepy manager, all of 20 years old with a neck tattoo, but that was the only downside. Plush red wraparound booth seating and dim lighting...go there to relax away from the hustling Vegas crowd."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Large portions so I recommend sharing. Bloody Mary was supposed to be spicy but wasn't. Fixed it with a little extra Tabasco. It's very busy on weekends for breakfast/ brunch so prepare to wait 40min or get there early."}
{"text":"Ima just keep it real I don't want anyone to go through what I went through. The Scorpion drink tastes like shit. When I talked to the waitress who brought out the drink, she said they don't take drinks off the bill even if you don't like it. I ordered it frozen, it tastes like rotten orange juice. Very bitter, didn't even drink it at all. What a waste, horrible customer service as well. Our waiter had an attitude.



HOWEVER...... the food is bomb I ordered wings. 5 stars on the wings and fries."}
{"text":"Awesome place for lunch! I had the munch breakfast, husband had the Buffalo chicken wrap, they were both awesome. It was a 40 minute wait but in Vegas at lunch time I figured that was a good sign. The service was awesome, Sarah was our server and she was very attentive despite being so busy!! Food came out super fast as well."}
{"text":"Had the BEST eggs Benedict I've ever had. A classic Vegas gem you won't want to miss. Immediate seating, great customer service, reasonable prices, awesome classic breakfast food. Five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is VEGAS.  It is super cozy and perfect to relax before hitting strip or have a night cap after all that partying. It is my favorite place for happy. $5 - $6 drinks and deals on appetizers. Next I will try the dinner side."}
{"text":"big portion. great old school atmoshphere. my steak was cooked right. food is basic diner quality food. i don't think anyone comes here for the gourmet food. i like it and will be back...."}
{"text":"We come here anytime we are in Vegas.  Ordered the oatmeal today and I am disappointed that they've decreased the portion size (and not the price). I generally can't finish my meal but today I'm leaving hungry. 

I need to add that upon checking out I was charged for a 'small oatmeal' which I was not aware was an option. So, while I wasn't asked which size I would like and I'm not entirely full I'm not stuffed either"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a Las Vegas institution. One of the best breakfast in Las Vegas. At 1am and you just don't know where to eat the go to place is The Peppermill. Warning the portions are hugh. My favorite thing on the menu is the fruit platter, its good enough to share with four friends."}
{"text":"Thankfully Yelp steered us towards this restaurant on the first morning of our trip. It was just a short walk away from the hotel and the crazy bright sign made it clear where we needed to go. 

All of the reviews stating that the decor is crazy, are so true! Mirrored ceiling tiles, pink and blue lighting, fake flowers, and flamingo lamps! Wow. Hello vegas. I've missed you.

The breakfast menu was extensive and the feta cheese and vegetable omlette caught my eye. Artchokes at a restaurant that looks like a strip club? Yes please!! I saw they had a meal with turkey sausage but it wasn't listed on the 'Sides' menu. Plus a side of meat was $5 and so that wouldn't have won anyways. The boyfriend got a ham and cheese omlette and about 15 minutes later, two giant plates arrived before us. Each omlette must have been made with at least 5 eggs and there were about 2 potatoes worth of hashbrowns. My omlette was delicious and there were tons of vegetables and some provolone cheese melted in the centre, with feta on top. We both managed to take half of our meals to go and they fully fed us the next morning too. For $12 per meal, that's an awesome deal.

I would have to say that the perfect ending to our meal was a party of 3 who came and sat across from us. Not only did one member have a giant 1L bottle of watter with him, but he also put on his sunglasses 5 minutes after they arrived. A hangover at its best! But what's with the coloured sugar??"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to dine at Peppermill... The atmosphere as well as the great food! The waitresses are always friendly... The food is is cooked to perfection and large portions.... Have enjoyed Peppermill since it opened.. Every time we go to Vegas it's a 'must' for at least one meal"}
{"text":"This place has been here for ages serving old school Vegas types and your new class of tourists. It has everything under the sun with a pretty extensive menu that almost reads like a book. It's a little on the expensive side but the portions of food are amazing. Both me and my friend paid about 20$ for dinner and had a whole other meal that we boxed up to take home. Not to mention there excellent drink selection. ( Take on the 64oz Scorpion, if you dare) This place not only has history here and has been around but it was actually used in the filming of the movie \"Casino\" which is a favorite film of mine, I'd say it's a must go for any Vegas/Movie fan."}
{"text":"The hubby and I returned here last Saturday with friends. Once again, Peppermill did not disappoint!

This place definitely deserves a visit every time you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed. Our food came out so late and all backwards. They never came back to refill drinks. Our food was cold. I am a local and I have ate here a lot but I will never come back. I brought friends from out of town and they were so disappointed! They do know how to push drinks thought."}
{"text":"This place was great 
Looks iffy on the outside and totally Funk on the inside.  It's looks like Gorge Clinton was the interior designer.  The food was really good and the staff was very friendly.  They are open 24 hours \"+\" very recommend."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great American food, and fast service. 
They have someone walk around and take pictures of you at the table, and you may purchase a bigger print if you pay, which we did (:

5 Stars"}
{"text":"The Peppermill has been my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas for over 30 years.  Forget all of the glitz and glamour of the strip.  
The food is top of the Mark, the drinks are amazing.  The atmosphere is of old time Vegas.  Family friendly.  My all time favorite breakfast is the Meteriaian Omelet.  It's to die for.  It's my first stop going to Vegas every year.  Please don't change a thing.  Service is stellar.  Can't wait to go again and again."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE for breakfast in Vegas. But it seems to me the prices have gone up since we were here last. It's easy to spend $30 on breakfast and coffee including tip & tax, with no booze. I would argue it's worth it. Try the crab cakes Benedict. Huge portion (3) and some of the best crab cakes I've ever had.
On the other hand, Coffee is $3.95. I'm drinking water and going to Starbucks for a latte after.
Here's the BEST news: if you're 60+, you can order off the senior/junior menu which hides on the last page of the menu. Regular portion of awesome hashbrowns, one egg, two bacon, one toast, $6.25. The fruit cup was enough for two at $7.50. Good value if you're old like me."}
{"text":"Visited the Peppermill for a late lunch around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. Dining solo so I avoided the wait for a table and walked right up to counter seating. For some reason, even though I'm no one special, the shift supervisor waited on me personally and the service was excellent. 

I got the turkey burger with sweet potato fries, and it was both large and tasty. 

Love the ambiance and neon lighting. I'm Generation X-er, so anthing that reminds me of a Brat Pack movie is going to sit well with me. 

Don't forget to check out the Firepit Lounge, located just to your left as you walk in. Totally different atmosphere but just as positive. Perhaps a somewhat slower, more laid back pace. Enjoyed this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! We went for breakfast (but had lunch). The wait was 45 minutes but it flew by! We sat at the fireside and ordered two Bloody Mary's, they were made to perfection! We had a pastrami sandwich and a club sandwich both with curly fries and both sandwiches were delicious! The curly fries were crispy and not really over seasoned, I can't stand it when they're over seasoned and that over powers the taste of the potatoes. The atmosphere is gorgeous it has a very 70's theme vibe but not dated at all (if that makes sense lol). The serve was attentive and friendly and they have a photographer walking around taking pictures if you'd like a picture memory. 

We really enjoyed it and will definitely return to check out their dinners and breakfasts!"}
{"text":"Overall, the vibe of this place is cute, waitresses are sassy, and the food is okay. We made the mistake of not sticking to breakfast. The omelettes and pancakes going by looked good, but we stuck with sandwiches. Onion rings and fries are mediocre. The tomatoes on the caprese appetizer were ok, definitely not hot house variety."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant! Ordered the french toast ambrosia and the club sandwich with onion rings. I also ordered the bubble bath cocktail (about $10), which was huge and refreshing. Everything was delicious. Prices are great (about $12-14/plate) and portions are huge. Love the diner/club decor; even the waitresses have costumes.  It was a very fun spot. Will definitely return to try the desserts."}
{"text":"This retro restaurant definitely deserves praise. The size of the restaurant and seating, the food, the service and the drinks make this spot what it is. Upon walking in, we were given amazing service despite the fact it was over packed. When seated, we were immediately brought water and menus by at least 3 people. (Everyone helps everyone at this diner). The pricing can be pricy but let me tell you how it is well worth it. Even the drinks. I purchase a drink called Liquid Marijuana for $16. Skinny glass but jammed packed with liquor. They servers know the menu by heart and can really help you decide what you want if you can't choose (so much to choose from)."}
{"text":"Walking in here is like a time warp back to the 80's.  Polyester shirts, black gowns for the cocktail waitresses, fake cherry blossom trees, pink neon lights everywhere, flamingo stained glass lamps, permed hair, scrunchies, faded jeans, Reeboks.....

Cheap food and portions enough for two or three on one plate.  

Bartenders in the Fireside Lounge are rude imo."}
{"text":"Was sent here by a former local as the \"it\" place to go. It didn't disappoint. Love the old Vegas vibe, the neon, the fire in the water pit, the tall Russian waitress, the prices, the drinks. Love!"}
{"text":"Zowwweee! What a tacky wonderful treasure! Pink/purple neon everywhere...fake plants/trees ..perfect diner breakfast...and WOW....what a lounge area...flaming fire pit surrounded by water....bar packed even at 9am.....some of the cheapest drinks on the strip.....but again, go for the visual overload....this is now a total, absolute, uncompromising MUST whenever back in town. Utterly unique....legendary!"}
{"text":"This is an okay spot! It's worth the wait and if you have a large group, expect to wait. If you have a large appetite, this is the place for you. 

We were in town for ROLLER CON!!!

So there were a lot of us at the time. We basically took the entire back of the place. Some of us had been here everytime they come to Vegas and they promised whatever we ordered it would be tasty and filling. 

Great heavens to Betsy, the pancakes are ridiculously huge if you order the pancake platter. Luckily, I was with a group of damn near hangry derby girls working out all day.

It was a good experience!"}
{"text":"What a throwback. Walking in here felt like I was walking into a time machine and going back about 30-40 years. The place looks like it has been untouched with the exception of an interesting set of flat panel screen TVs by the lobby entrance. 
Other than that, even the waiter and waitresses all stress fairly different than a typical diner, which gives this place a unique vibe. 

We were sat immediately on a Monday afternoon, but it took a little longer than it should have for our server to come (and mind you, I was slightly hung over and needed a big greasy meal in my belly). 

Our server came (prompt thereafter), but wasn't overly friendly or anything. Just did his job and took care of us with no issues. I ordered a scramble which was huge.... really, EVERYTHING you order here can be easily split with another person. But, it was nice to take it back to the hotel to eat for dinner. 

The food was decent, nothing spectacular, but I think the overall vibe of this place, along with the large portions is why this place is so highly regarded. Oh, and not to mention all of the movies that have scenes inside this restaurant over the years is probably another reason. 

Would I come back here if in Vegas again? Ehhh, most likely not, but I don't have anything really bad to say about it. It's location is certainly not in the most convenient spot if you are staying and walking around the strip. It's just too far north of all the action so taking a taxi, Uber, Lyft, or driving yourself would be the most convenient option. I would imagine once they complete the new Asian-style themed hotel/casino across the street in a few years that this place will be even more busy.

Not a bad choice to eat!"}
{"text":"Great service!! I ordered the rib-eye and it was cooked to medium which was perfect. Ordered a soup and baked potato while my bf ordered a different steak and got fries and Caesar salad. The soup salad and baked potato was great, the fries weren't. 

Anyway the steaks were soft and tender and cooked perfectly. 

Great $60 dinner, with lots of extra leftovers!"}
{"text":"I was feeling a bit ill when I came here, so I don't think I got to experience the full effect of The Peppermill. Also trying to save a bit of money, and my first day in Vegas, this place was a bit pricey for breakfast if you're A) not hungry and B) not looking to spend a lot of dough. 

They took our photo and gave us this \"Oh so cute\" little postcard of the folks at our table, trying to sell us the bigger picture for Oh, I dont' know. Fifteen bucks, maybe? Something ridiculous. 

The Peppermill itself was pretty awesome. It was all pink and puple and yeah, disco, very colorful. The waitresses were wearing lollipopish apron type things. The hostesses were wearing these hot little dresses that might have matched the carpet in some of the more dingy, older hotels (Riviera, Circus Circus, etc), but they somehow made it look hot. 

The food was in heaping portions. I actually ended up splitting mine with a friend. We got some sort of Mexincan-styled omelette, rye toast, potatoes, etc. We didn't even finish our meal. 

It was pretty awesome, and I'll go back sometime when I'm feeling better- And when I feel better about spending the money- Maybe when I have a bigger appetite! It definitely seemed like a novelty."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast on the strip. Went to Hash House A Go Go and it doesn't compare to the Peppermill. The Peppermill is always packed during breakfast and brunch hours, but being able to wait it out in the Lounge makes it a breeze. We were in Vegas on a 6 day vacation, and ate brunch at the Peppermill three times...it's that good. 

Try the Feta, Tomato and Spinach omelet! It's amazing..."}
{"text":"Truly an A-OK review..

The atmosphere was fun but not as Vegas-y and boisterous as I intended.  Thankfully, the menu helped.

My friend ordered probably the fattiest sausage, egg, bacon, cheese concoction available.  She loved it.  I had the sliders and they were meh.. but their homemade chips were some kind of awesome.

Like most touristy joints, they had a decent looking blonde walking about taking overpriced pictures.  She was very friendly and made the experience for my friend (out-of-towner) fun.

The sugar jar entertained us.. you can just pour it on the table and have fun.  We drew lots of shapes and took lots of pictures.  None of them are PG enough for Yelp.

All in all, I'll be back.. It's close to the strip and makes for a great place to take friends from out of town.   The fact that it's open 24/7 helps for those late night cravings."}
{"text":"Walked in around 10am and was seated right away.  20mins later...there was a line out the door. crazy!

Food: Overall the food portions were huge.
1. Waffle - Huge portion with butter on top.  Nothing special.  Just a waffle.
2. French Toast - 6 slices of toast.  nothing spectacular
3. Veggie Omelet - The ingredients were great but the omlet itself did not hold up well meaning they added to much liquid (water, milk...i dunno what it was)

Overall, the food isnt very expensive but the portions are huge.  It did lack a lot of flavor but it wasn't horrible.  It would be hard for me to recommend this place for food.  

I would recommend the lounge.  It was actually pretty nice but weird at the same time.  Diner on 1 side and a sexy hot lounge on the other."}
{"text":"The Peppermill Restaurant was really good. We enjoyed our meals and our drinks. I look forward to returning when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is unapologetically Las Vegas. It has cool decor and a very showtime kind of vibe. Sharing the Denver Omelette, we still couldn't finish it! Great food and great ambience"}
{"text":"Best biscuits and gravy ever! Totally Vegas on the inside with neon and gaudy decor. It was awesome!"}
{"text":"Kitschy and groovy! Hubbie and I loved the old vegas diner feel. The cocktail waitresses were even wearing black gowns! Def. for cool people that don't take themselves too seriously! 
It really is out there, by Riviera and has it's own parking lot and famous for being in several shows movies like Casino etc. Open 24 hours which is great and has a lounge/bar.

I know my mom would def. not appreciate it as it is old, not pretty and who knows if they ever dust those fake flower trees hanging over us. The couple we dined with were healthy/picky eaters so the huge portions might've been a turn off. 

But we'll be back! and next time we will SHARE!
corned beef hash was delish, fresh baked blueberry muffin was great, the seafood omelette was good but not too much seafood, kids meals are huge too (maybe share or skip it completely) Sampler huge. Even the salad my friend got was huge and came with fruit too. Mimosas were great! 
They take a postcard pic, then try to sell you a bigger copy for $15."}
{"text":"Best I can describe The Peppermill is Jack Rabbit Slims (pulp fiction) meets cheesy old Vegas. Neat tourist restaurant if you want to eat somewhere with a Vegas-feel. Servers are in costume and the neon lights are everywhere. Average food but it's all about the ambiance at The Peppermill. Worth a shot if you're stumbling around the strip one night."}
{"text":"This place is just what the doctor ordered after a long night in Vegas.  Think \"IHOP does Vegas\".  Not only are the portions large and reasonably priced, but it was quite delicious.  The eggs, bakey and hashbrowns really hit the spot.  Also, they have a nice bar/lounge area with a huge fire pit, if you're into that kind of thing.  The atmosphere is unlike any other diner.  Definitely worth visiting while you're in town."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good...Atmosphere and servers make the place. Now to the bad. We went for breakfast, and it was average at best. I ordered bacon and eggs, poached. Two of the three eggs were way over done, so our server got a new order. By the time the they came out, the rest of the breakfast was finished, and the new order was over cooked as well."}
{"text":"I love this place, no joke.  For years and years I have come to Vegas, and have been missing out.  It's so weird, it's awesome, it was one of the highlights of my trip, no lie. 

Peppermill feels like to stepped in a time capsule into a diner with odd waitresses wearing ball gowns.  The food is cheap and very very good.  They are open 24 hours, and have a super cool little lounge that was filmed on Gigolos (If you haven't seen it google, no judgement here :))  We ordered sandwiches all round, with sweet potato fries.  Everything we had was a super large portion and very tasty.  

The lounge part is my favorite with a big sunken in room with a large fire pit right in the middle.  Drinks are reasonable, and service was fast.  Def. a cool little spot to get your grub on at 3a.m. or romantic spot for drinks.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"OMG, can you say gluttony at it's effin best!!!

went here late night after the crue show/afterparty....one of the guys on staff at the hard rock recommended it.

being the fat campers that we are on weekends and definitely during a b-day celebration, we ordered a few dishes thinking we would split them.

*PLEASE BE FORWARNED* the portions are GI-NORMOUS!!!!!!!!

order one thing and split it b/w two...we had to cancel two of our dishes, lucky for us things were coming in phases, if not we would have been seriusly F'ed!

the food is good for late night! better than a dinner spot.  also, it was packed with other friendly (slightly inebriated) late-night party go-ers. good times, relaxed vibe, not pricey."}
{"text":"The pep!!  I like this place. Great for a drunken 5am food run...

Traditional dishes like omelettes and pancakes...

I warn you however, the dishes are huge.  You can definitely share the plates.  It's not the best food on earth but it's good large portioned meals reasonably priced...

I mean it's cheaper than eating at the hotel, and because you can share the dishes... it becomes more valuable.

The only draw back is it's far north from all the action and it looks like you stepped into an episode of \"All in the family\" and you're expectin vic tayback to make your omellete..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting Las Vegas and wanted to have a nice dinner that left our bellies happy but didn't take away from the money we were saving for our gambling addiction. Unfortunately, google led us to this sad sad establishment that looked more like a cheap brothel with its decor and bright florescent pink & blue lights. We ordered the Peppermill sampler. This name should be changed to \"The Frozen Walmart Sampler\" We've had higher quality food from CVS. We ordered a bottle of Prosecco, we were presented with a bottle of pond water. And at $34 it felt equivalent to a punch in the tooth. I enjoy the taste of nose bleeds better. Our entrees were Gyros & a rack of pork ribs. When I say Gyros, I mean dried out sanitary towels that wouldn't even satisfy the drunkest person. I'd rather wither away in the Vegas dessert than eat these Gyros that were wrapped in a loaf of bread. And as for the pork ribs, I've seen more quality meat on a stray Afghan dog. The ribs were smothered in what can only be described as Goodwill's branded barbecue sauce. We took one bite of these entrees & immediately realized we had made the worst mistake either of us had made in our entire lives. My boyfriend stated that he'd rather be given a prostate exam by Captain Hook, I agreed. We were given better service from the uber driver. We were seen by so many waiters/waitresses it was enough to cause attachment issues in our personal relationships. As for the bathrooms, they were disgusting. They had has much cleanliness as a porta potty construction site after they had eaten Mexican food. I thought Jack Nicholson was going to axe down the door. The overall atmosphere was equivalent to that of Michael Jackson's funeral. The costumes that the people in the kitchen wear will fool you, they are not chefs. We still left a tip because we felt as if we were doing an act of kindness helping our poor waiter out of that place."}
{"text":"Picture the movie Casino, which may stir up images of how Las Vegas looked before the turn of the century. Before almost every casino, bar, and restaurant either became 5 stars, a total dump, or was owned by some big conglomerate, there was something in between. The Peppermill, my friends, is just that. 

The Peppermill is a piece of history. Nostalgia if you will. It brings back memories of days gone by. It's nothing fancy. It's simply an old school diner, with old school vinyl booths, waitresses, and colors in a non-pretentious setting that probably hasn't changed in some time. The food is typical diner fare and nothing that will blow your socks off, but I must say that my Denver omelette reminds me of something that even Fred Flinstone would have a hard time finishing. 

The prices, although more than an average diner, aren't too bad, especially compared to some of the lush Vegas breakfast buffets. The Peppermill is located down the strip in front of the Riviera, which means having to fight large crowds and hungover tourists is minimal and an added bonus! 

If you're looking for fresh coffee, fresh eggs, and a side of personality in a casual setting, then look no more. You have reached your destination."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised that after 20+ reviews this place has a 4 1/2 average rating.  First off, so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard, let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's.
  Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...
    Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).  
   So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.
  Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas.

{"text":"Great food and fast service for the amount of people that goes in. With decent price and large amount of food."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! Love the atmosphere  not a fan of the chorizo and eggs but the Eggs Benedict or French toast are incredibly delicious"}
{"text":"Waited for almost an hour on line, it was a Saturday also. Food was good, big portion. A must place to take people from out of town."}
{"text":"Great breakfast 24 hours a day, expect a wait if you head out in the day time. The pancakes are huge."}
{"text":"You can disregard my last review. this place got cocky and went to hell pretty quickly. 
1) service sucked. After waiting 10-15 minutes just to order, the waitress had no apologies. When the food came 5 minutes after that, and was sent back 3 times, she had nothing to say about that. When I went to go pay and the cashire asked about the food I told him it was horrible and he laughed then the waitress next to him said, \"ya we've been having issues with that for a while now.\"
2) Food was tragic. cold, tastless, and off. 
3) the lounge was very random.  the drinks were weak, service slow, and I never got the money I cashed out! 

Not coming back, ever."}
{"text":"Oh, wow.  Where to start?  This is a Las Vegas institution.  When I was a dealer at the old Sahara, we used to go here after work at 3:00 AM for an omelet and champagne.  The fireside lounge is kitchy, old-school Vegas, but the bar staff are great and the mixologists build great drinks.  Oh, and did I mention the food is tasty, reasonably priced, and there's a lot of it?  If you're on the strip and need a good meal at a good price, or you want to sit back and relax in a nice lounge and enjoy a beverage, this is THE place to go."}
{"text":"You haven't truly experienced Las Vegas unless you've come to the Fireside Lounge. Great classic atmosphere, interesting music videos that are great conversation starters. Service is top notch and the drinks are tasty. The cafe side also open 24/7 is vintage Vegas at its finest as well."}
{"text":"This place is classic Vegas cool. A group of 7 of us went on a Friday morning during March Madness. Only had about a 15 minute wait. We were able to grab drinks in the lounge while we waited. Super cool fireside lounge area. Food was very good and reasonably priced. It's not your typical over priced Vegas food location. Biscuits and gravy was on point. Service was good and timely. We will definitely go back on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"I love old school vegas and The Peppermill is a perfect example of that! To be honest,  I like this place because of the atmosphere. The food is okay but I really just like how it's a time warp. Plus they are open 24 hours.

The nachos are terrible. The cheese was hard and when I mentioned it to the waitress, she said that's how they always are. Hmm...ok. For $17, I would expect the nachos to be delicious. 

Most of the time when I come here I get the philly cheesesteak.($12.95) It's exactly what you want when you order food from a place like this, yummy and greasy. lol! It's messy and that is how I like them. A few times I ordered breakfast and it seems like my friends always order breakfast too. It's pretty good, nothing special.

Overall, if you want a fun atmosphere, this is your place. It's not the cheapest place for breakfast on the strip but its gonna cost more than if you go a street over, even though it's kinda in an empty part of the strip.Thinking about it, some of the stuff on the menu is way overpriced but you're paying for the location and atmosphere! If you're a tourist, I would go here! This place has been around for a long time and it has been in a lot of TV shows, so that's kinda fun too.

I almost forgot my favorite thing to order here...the banana split. It's huge and amazing!! You need at least two people to share but you could easily share it with four people. My friend and I have gone there twice just for the banana split!"}
{"text":"Talk about blast from the past. Neon lights, weird floral arrangements and fake trees. So awesome. Such a great place to people watch after a long night out. 

We arrived after midnight and this was actually our first stop out in Vegas. We ordered a few drinks and appetizers. I had the shrimp cocktail which was really fresh and good with nice plump chilled shrimp. My husband ordered beer battered cheese sticks. They were crisp and fresh served with a side of marinara sauce.  

I ordered the Key Lime pie martini, complete with a graham cracker rim. It was creamy, sweet and strong. Loved it! My husband had a huge Mai Tai and I actually laughed at him when it came out because it was a giant girly drink. It was also very strong and good. 

I wish we could have ordered some of the breakfast items but I wasn't too hungry. I really loved the atmosphere and the very 80's vibe they have going on in here. Such a fun place to dine and have drinks. Our waiter Jose was very attentive and nice. Our cocktail waitress was also very patient as we were taking forever to decided on what to order. We were given plenty of space to enjoy ourselves and just enough service to fulfill our needs."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast and all I can say is... AMAZING!!! Definitely will be back on my next Vegas trip or maybe tomorrow"}
{"text":"This is a definite Vegas classic, never to be duplicated. Well, let's be honest. It should be against the law to duplicate it. One is enough for the world. 

The diner is standard yet with massive portions deli fare, with decent sandwiches and stuff like that. Pro tip: Get the multicolored sprinkles for your shake or dessert. I don't know why but they have them so indulge!

The fireside lounge, on the other hand, is where it is at. Fake fire places, neon lights, velour couches, massive frozen drinks bigger than your head, and a cheesy ambiance beyond anything you could possible imagine truly define the scene. Check out the pictures if you must but instead, just go there and experience it for once. You may regret it but it is still worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Went here with my bf and we ordered the \"small\" nachos and they were huge. We both couldn't finish them. We go in the lounge and enjoy a seat by the fire. The lounge is kind of an older crowd but on date night it doesn't matter. I think the drinks range around $7. Get the Scorpion! It's $20, but worth it!!! The service is sometimes on the slow side in the lounge, but I love this place and would go back!!!"}
{"text":"Huge servings and the food is really great.  We ordered eggs benedict, corned beef hash and chicken wings and all were super yummy.  Love the décor of this place.  It was about a 30 minute wait time for 3 people on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Love this place.  A little busy from the tourist crowd but a good diner built for speed and quality.  I had breakfast here twice: chorizo and eggs and a bacon and egg offering.  Both were served up quickly and at a high level of quality.  Super attentive staff and great banter with the wait staff at the bar.  Good personnel working here and management should be applauded for brining in and keeping these folks.  I'll bring my friends back to explore more of the menu next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The wait was long but to be expected on a Saturday around lunch time. Once we were seated we were brought water and asked if we wanted cocktails. The menu has good choices. We ordered bruschetta, French toast, scrambled eggs, curly fries chicken fingers and a waffle. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS!! A nice bonus was that they took our picture and gave a copy as a souvenir."}
{"text":"This place is just so crazy and different... I love hanging out here. And the cheese plate will make your friend the happiest he has ever been"}
{"text":"Absolute magic. 

The Fireside Lounge transforms a person. Sitting there drinking Jack Daniels while eating plate after plate of ribs served by beautiful women in long evening/nightgowns all the while surrounded by fire and water and live concert videos, this is why America is, and will continue to be, the greatest country on earth!

There is simply nothing wrong with this place and everything right about it. if I could give it 10 stars I would, in fact, fuck it, I am. 10 stars."}
{"text":"Love coming to the place. Open 24 hours and still awesome!! Friendly service, reasonably priced and great service!   I'm a huge fan of their breakfast options and they are usually very quick on service.To be open 24/7/365 is awesome!  
They do get very busy at times so depending on the time you may have a wait."}
{"text":"Me and my aunt came here while visiting vegas and wanted to eat at this location, now it's really weird for me when I went in here, because everything is PURPLE!!!, the food was OK, not the best we ever had, but just OK, the servers wear clothes like the women wear clothes in the RIO on the casino floors, I would personally never come here again because of the food, not worth it to me. needs improvement on the food part, but the servers are SUPER friendly. I give 5 stars on the customer service."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is sort of like Denny's slutty older sister. That's the best way to describe it. You might think that's a good thing since, like any normal person, nothing gets you more hot and bothered than simultaneously thinking about skanks and Moons Over My Hammy. In reality, it's not so much a good thing (I know, hard to imagine how a slutty Denny's wouldn't be amazing). Unfortunately, the food is pretty terrible, and the service is about on-par with any other diner. If there is one saving grace, it's the nachos. And not because they're particularly delicious, but because of the sheer excess with which they're slammed onto your table. 

Atmosphere is about what you'd expect: lots of drunk people eating nachos. And lots of riff-raff treating it like an actual restaurant. It's not a restaurant, it's a hardcore nacho stop before you go throw up and go to sleep."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this flashback from the past.  Located just between Encore and Riviera this place has a good selection for you after the long night of drinking. They pretty much serve you their entire menu all day. For the price and the cost you are better here than the massive crowds at the buffets or hash hash spots in the city."}
{"text":"Love this place !! Ton of history and was in one of my favorite movies CASINO!! 

The food is amazing as alway and the Bloody Mary's are the BEST !! Wait could be up to an hour but you can chill in the bar with TV's a Fire Pit and great Drinks !! 

Today we came in for lunch and it was awesome ! Very Busy but always worth a Visit !! Check it out if you are in town for a visit and of live here and have never been !! You will not be disappointed by the food or the portions!!"}
{"text":"After seeing this place on a show featuring cheap eats in Vegas, we made a point of checking  it out.  It's in a non-descript mini-mall on the strip, that if you blink, you'll pass it.  Once inside, you definitely feel like you're creating a memory not soon forgotten.  Neon lights and indoor fake trees aren't something you find everywhere.  The menu is vast and there's something for everyone.  Here's the thing...PORTIONS ARE HUGE!!!.  I ordered the Denver omlette.  When it arrived, I couldn't believe my eyes.  I asked the server how many eggs they put in it, she told me 8-10!  I use that many eggs to feed my family of 4  at a typical breakfast!  The food was good, but nothing extrordinary.  At a table adjacent to ours, we saw them deliver a fruit salad...it included an whole pineapple.  This is definitely the place to come if you are really hungry.  The disappointing thing was that the food wasn't that cheap.  Lunch for four of us was about $80.  Could have had an all-you-can eat buffet for that price.  Service was so-so.  Glad we checked it out, not sure we'd go back though."}
{"text":"The portion here is really big. My friends and I had the steak salad, the chicken noodle soup, and southwest chicken salad. We didn't finish all of it and had to to go the rest. The sitting area is very nice, I love the cherry blossom trees that they have in the middle of the room. I really like this place."}
{"text":"For me, the Peppermill was just ok.  Maybe it was my choice in food, maybe it was the fact I was about to go get a tattoo, and that was on my mind, but either way, this place didn't WOW me.  Happened upon this joint based on a recommendation from a co-worker.  We went on Valentine's Day for lunch.  Loved the decor- the funky old school vibe was neat.

The coffee was big and excellent.  We shared the tomato soup which was surprisingly cheesy and very good.  In addition, we shared a chicken balsamic sandwich, which was fine, but nothing special.  The onion rings it came with were good, but nothing different than your typical onion ring.  The service was just so-so... had to ask a couple times for water, but it was super busy so that was understandable.

Basically, not sure if I will go back again- maybe to check out the fireside lounge, but for me it really didn't rock my world."}
{"text":"I just spent the whole day walking around Vegas in nearly 100 degrees heat, just drinking vodka and rum induced slushes lol, with a tiny buzz going i hadn't really eaten anything all day. For the exception of a bite of pizza from my bff. Its 2am walking south bound on the strip ordered another margarita at Circus Circus 7th one today , I may have a problem lol, I needed some solids in me being still so warm out our appetites wasn't there so we just ordered some Nachos just to hold us till breakfsst. We ordered the Nachos 4 of us at under 18$ wasn't bad, expecting an average size plate to come out, instead this huge playe came out ready to feed the population of NV, ok so it was huge now the taste test, passed with flying colors, so much cheese, jalepenos, etc... i love the Peppermill."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we ordered athe Crab Cake Bene w/ Lupe.The food came pretty quickly but when I cut open the eggs, they were hard. Both of the eggs for our benedicts were literally hard. The hash browns weren't cooked all the way either. Lupe was no where to be found and so we had to flag down another server who kindly took back the food and had it remade. The newly made benedict came out after about 15mins and to be honest, it isn't worth the price. I was excited because of seeing the reviews and hearing about it but after trying it in person, I will no longer be coming back. An established restaurant should know its place and be professional. Literally Denny's, IHOP, Blueberry Hill's service beats this place. Perhaps this place does have good food but I was just unlucky. I recommend that people don't come during grave hours because all you will see is a bunch of servers, cooks standing around like there's no one in the restaurant. The last impression I got was Marisol with her leg up against the counter as we paid our check. How fabulous."}
{"text":"What can't I say about the Peppermill.  Old school Vegas!!
Great environment, nice seating and bar area for a date night out.  Good food (not excellent or would get a 5 star), excellent service and amazing desert options (try the sundaes).
Diner food is the main staple in the dining room and extremely unique drink options in the bar with the cool, blue fire pit INSIDE.
Take a moment to visit this classic Vegas location in between Wynn and SLS on the east side of the strip.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Such a cute diner! Love that the parking is huge and it is so close to the strip! I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and it was amazing. If you ever want to grab a bite after leaving the club this is the place they have so many selections and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Loved the service, the drinks and the vibe! It was so much fun - and it really was an unexpected find. It looked relatively unassuming from the outside, but super exciting as soon as you walk to the back bar!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is one of my favorite eateries in Las Vegas. The funky decor adds to the vibe of being in LV. It has the feel of the old school \"Rat Pack\" days rather than the typical Strip bigger is better style. We typically stop there for our first meal after the long drive from Orange County, or else just before we hit the road on the way out of town."}
{"text":"What the say is true! PORTIONS ARE HUGE!! I mean like GINORMOUS!! But well worth it! 

Decor was very retro. It almost looked like it was a converted strip club at one point, but it works well as it has a diner-ish feel to it.

We got a Lorraine Omelet and Corn Beef Hash. The omelet was bigger than the size of my face. I swear!! It was good cause it was nice and fluffy with the freshest ingredients. The hash browns OMG the hash browns were so crispy and good. I noticed they also add sweet onions to it cause some bites would be sweet. I finished the hash browns first before I finished my Omelette.. The Corn Beef Hash was sooo good as well. It was like happiness in my mouth! 

I tried the Bloody Mary and it was pretty good. I could taste the celery salt with the big celery they put inside it. But it was pretty tasty. =D

Definitely a place to go back to without a doubt! =D"}
{"text":"This place was great! There was a line when we got there (I think this comes with the territory) While waiting on some friends to arrived and our name to be called from the wait list we waiting in the fire pit lounge.  Drinks were made and pokies were available at the bar.  It's a nice place to relax while you wait.  Meals were HUGE and delicious.  Wait staff knowledgeable and souvenir pictures available if you desire.  Suitable for a night out on the town with the boys or for a family dining experience."}
{"text":"an expensive Denny's with a lot of mirrors, and pink and baby blue neon. What it lacks in gourmet and service it picks up with decor. From the multicolored sugar granuals to the strange 80's/miami/drag queen setting...this place is a Vegas institution. But not because of the food or service.

Expect to wait during busy meal times and check out the fireplace lounge. Also expect to pay Vegas Strip prices on basic plates of diner food.

Go for the ambiance when you need to put something in your stomach to soak up the drinks while on your whirl wind Vegas weekend trip....

one trip will probably be enough, but at least go once."}
{"text":"Review is only based on service and take out. We came here on a Friday night/Saturday morning at 5:00 AM! the place was full!! We came here because our limo driver convinced us it was popular and good. 

This place is a diner. The inside is very colorful as in purple, green, turquoise, yellow. From what I remember jungle themed.  Inside its a bit sketchy. Nothing like the other restaurants on the strip. Crowd was a bit more \"hood\" or \"ghetto\". Please don't hate me for these comments. 

We ordered a grilled chicken burger and a basket of fruit to go. The 2 others we were with stayed to dine in. They got breakfast. Lets just say they finished eating before we got our take out order. Once our order finally came she forgot our fruit basket and the check. We almost ended up leaving at the same time as the 2 that actually stayed and dined in. 

Service was terrible!!!!!  

I think I have to come back, dine in and try their breakfast."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since it had a great review on The Travel channel. It was really great."}
{"text":"Needless to say, the Peppermill is a landmark. The lights, the booths, the lounge and the ever friendly uniformed waitresses. Sure, it's a moderate pricing but the portions are well worth it. From appetizers to foo-foo drinks, everything is big. A personal fave is the Scorpion Bowl, a big drink for two I usually handle alone. Breakfast, lunch or dinner you had best bring your appetite.  A club sandwich that resembles something from Carnegie Deli? Pancakes wider in circumference than the plate their on? Great for a date night niche meal or just a late night hankering. And don't forget the lounge. Not an abundance of seating but what there is is plush and comfortable in the classic Vegas shadows. The fire pit is a nice touch with that special squeeze to get good drinks and appetizers and spend some time. Local or visiting, it's worth your time and appetite."}
{"text":"My \"Bucket List\" every time I go to Vegas! This is the swankiest places and as close to the Rat Pack era as one may get. I love the round velvet seats with the fire pits and neon lights! Wish I was with my someone special to go make out somewhere in there. It's the coolest of cool. 
We were there in August. The couple we introduced to this place absolutely loved it. He performs in Vegas all the time and never even heard of it. Kudos to taking him there."}
{"text":"Great vibe, awesome decor. I came for lunch. Had the BLT. It was delicious and huge; only ate half and was full. I'll definitely be back to check out the lounge."}
{"text":"Oh Peppermill....what is left to say about your gloriousness?

This is the single location I have been drunk in more than any other in the continental United States.

The ranch dressing is awesome.

Sitting on red velvet couches around a firepit talking to strange Australians is awesome. 

I feel sad for the servers and the outfits they have to wear.

Seriously, this is the place I always bring friends when I am in Vegas visiting the bro.  It is always a hit."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. It's a must when visiting Vegas. The wait is usually 45 minutes to 1 hour but moves quickly. The food is delicious and open 24 hours."}
{"text":"This is one of the places that I have to bring anyone from out of town. 
This place is so original. The decor is unlike anything you have seen in this era.
I come for the fire, plush group seating, and the best of Las Vegas COCKTAILS.

There is also an entire restaurant connected to the lounge, get the ice cream sunday!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always take my friends here when they come in town. Wait definitely sucks but not worth losing a star over and the fire in the bar is an awesome place to wait to be seated in the dining area."}
{"text":"Breakfast before going to convention Center . Good hearty breakfast. I had hash scramble with a spicy kieblasa type sausage in it with onions and peppers. More food than I can eat which says a ton."}
{"text":"Pretty gross breakfast. The only reason they are getting any stars is because the waitress was nice enough to take some of the food off the bill when she asked how I liked it and I answered honestly"}
{"text":"I've been here twice on two separate Vegas trips. For the first, I was hungover and looking for something heavy and tasty to calm my stomache, and for the second I was completely blitzed and practically falling asleep at the table. 

Both times, Peppermill gave me exactly what I needed: a giant cup of coffee, a huge plate of diner-style food, and a fun environment to eat in. The food wasn't stellar, nor was it bad. It just hit the spot both times.

This place may not be getting Michelin stars anytime soon, but it sure beats the hell out of eating watery eggs at Denny's at 4am."}
{"text":"Wow. Walking up to the place I was worried about the place I was about to walk into. The place looks quite dated. You walk in and you feel like an 80's mobster just punched you in the face and you're looking at a bunch of neon and velvet. But the food... Amazing. Get the blueberry muffin, came out warm, and best one I've had in my life. The bloody Mary is quite consistent and the food portions are well worth your dollar. Good place to start your Vegas romp."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot with a great ambiance.  Can we be crowded on the weekend and was especially crowded the Sunday after Mayweather fight."}
{"text":"Going here once a year, and it never disappoints! It is north of the strip,  easy walk from Encore Hotel if staying there. The place is fantasticly retro with a pink flamingo theme and servers in nice dresses.  

The food is good and the portions huge.  One dish is enough, no starters haha. 

Going here is like going back in time, and while waiting for food, check out the fancy  bar with a fire pit. 

I have only gone here for breakfast and if lucky, you get a table right a way but expect the place to be busy. 

So,  lean back and Picture Elvis sitting here in the early 70s with a nice portion of omelette :)"}
{"text":"Don't know why everyone keeps talking about how much food you get.  Average size portions, nothing to write home about. Had the porterhouse, very thin streak about what you would get at Dennys. Plus it was cold and over cooked."}
{"text":"Yes this place may have history and its 24hr operation may help keep it alive but the service just plainly SUCKS!!!! I went there for the first time on a week day around midnight because everything else was closed, no waiting line, not too busy, it took three different servers to take our order and get our food (3 ppl)  about 45 minutes or so later. Oh, the corona beer I ordered took the waitress from the bar 40 mins to come back and let me know she forgot to order it. Hmmm, classy? NOT!! Save your money and go to Dennys instead, they may not have the neon hype and fake trees but their service is waaay better!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.. Large portions.. Excellent  service. A must whenever I'm in Vegas! 
Servers are always humble and giving.."}
{"text":"The best hot wings ever! Burger was also great. They even made my 10 year old son his own pizza which isn't even on their menu. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Recommend the fruit place w/sherbet. The Mello cream is fantastic. The steak salad was delicious, I'm going to be craving it till my next visit to LV!"}
{"text":"Our friend took us here because he loooves it and always comes here on Vegas trips. 

We were expecting amazing, and it did not deliver. Maybe our expectations were too high or maybe we weren't wasted enough. 

Crowded at 4am, slow service, and food of Denny's quality. Not the diner experience i was expecting. 

won't be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved everything about the peppermill. Screams nostalgia. Delicious food, unquie bar. I will never come to Vegas again without stopping by the peppermill."}
{"text":"Oh this place. It's classic vegas. Lively music, neon lights, and 70-80's decor. Large food portions which taste great. The late hours are super convenient too for your late night cravings."}
{"text":"Old-school, open 24-hours, and greasy good food. We enjoyed our 2:00 am pancakes and milkshakes, and while I might pop in again for middle-of-the-night fare, it's not necessarily someplace you must go in Vegas."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast on our way out of Vegas. We waited forever. But the wait was worth it! The food was great. Totally hit the spot. I had the pancakes and bacon and sausage and eggs! Totally yummy. The coffee and hot chocolate comes in huge mugs, which is sort of different from your regular diner. 

Service is decent and prices aren't too bad, portions are huge, so be careful what you order because it's a ton of food. The decor is cute, 50's style with lit up booths and plants and lights everywhere. Definitely Vegas-like.  Worth trying for sure."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in a long while. Still as nice as always, my husband and I stopped in for one drink while out and about the other night. Love the cocktail servers dresses!"}
{"text":"The hostess underestimated the time by half an hour.  Could have chosen another option   When I waited my 45 minutes and went back to check at hostess stand she told me it would be another 25 minutes rather rudely.  The manager Beau defended her by stating it is hot out and people don't rush to leave. No apologizes   The menu has been abbreviated and many items deleted that were popular staples.  I frequent this restaurant and recommend it to many tourists.  Needless to say that won't be occurring any longer"}
{"text":"So good! I had the Feta & Vegetable omelette w/ egg whites and someone else in my group had the San Francisco special, the portions were huge!! Other people in my group also had the french toast and hawaiian burger (I think??) and everyone loved what they had. Definitely coming back next time I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great find next to the Wynn.  By walking through Encore, you can walk to it very easily. We only had a short wait on a Saturday morning and enjoyed our breakfast. Very generous portions and it was all delicious. We had to take some to go!"}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I were in Vegas, we stayed at the Mirage so normally we wouldn't even have ventured this far down the strip. However, our friends were at the Riviera and said they had heard Peppermill was pretty good. So we actually came here twice. The first time was the first night that we were there, and the second time was for breakfast the day before we left. Both times there were a decent amount of people there, but we only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated.

Service overall left a little to be desired. But I mean, what can you really expect? We only were on the restaurant side, although we heard good things about the lounge side of the place. Definitely a diner type feel to this place and whatever you get, underestimate what you can eat because everything is MASSIVE. Two people could easily split most of their plates.

One time I got the Feta Cheese and Vegetable Omelet, which was huge. It came with an English muffin (or toast or whatever) and potatoes, and I definitely couldn't finish everything. The other time I got the Pancake Combo which included pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sausage. The pancakes were like 8 inches in diameter! One of our friends just got the pancakes (not combo) and they were literally a foot across. I mean, massive. Everything tasted really good, no complaints about any of the food. This is definitely a legit option for any time of the day (open 24 hours of course) although I have heard that it gets really busy around breakfast/brunch time."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere- feel like you are back at a bar in the 60s- like to hit it up when in vegas if with a large group"}
{"text":"Ordered the corned beef hash with 3 basted eggs. It had so much oil, it was like a soup.. couldn't even eat it without wanting to puke. Literally used a spoon to take out the oil. 
I ate only a small portion and disliked it. Wish they took it off my bill but oh well"}
{"text":"Must have been an off night. I came in for dinner. No waiting. Many empty tables. Although by myself, I was offered a table so I took it. Huge group nearby had ordered drinks before I sat down. I was able to get my food order in before they did. I ordered iced tea. Never offered a refill. Drank that plus the water I was served. Ordered country fried steak and eggs. Smaller than I remember portion of hash browns. Skimpy amount of country gravy. Decent egg portion. Tasted ok. Must have been a dinner cook who isn't familiar with breakfast. 
Been here many times. This was one to forget. So was the line to pay."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come here ever since seeing it on \"Holly's World\" and I finally got to!!!

I didn't know what kind of food they had here but apparently they are famous for their omelets? I saw some and they were ginormous! 10-12 eggs?!

I ordered the NY steak and eggs- so good! So much food. 

The rainbow sprinkles were super cute! If I'd gotten any sort of sweet dish, I would definitely have poured that on my dish!"}
{"text":"Wow, Yelp did not fail me on finding this jewel! 

First off, its a bit down from where the hotels are located. However, after a long 15-20 min walk, you'll be glad that you made the trek. When we arrived on Friday, there was about a 15-20 min late. Not too bad. The dining room is huge with ample seats at the kitchen as well. The lounge is separate from the dining room. 

We ordered a couple of bloody marys that were HUGE and so delish. We ordered the country chicken fried steak and corned beef hash. The portions are HUGE. But oh-my-guh. So good. I tried to eat as much as I could because I knew I would never find anything like this anywhere else again. 

I will most definitely come back the next time I am in Vegas. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"A step back in time giving an Old Vegas feel. The food is good, portions are huge, service friendly and (for the Strip) fair priced. We take visitors here when they want to experience that hospitality and fun that seems missing in some tourist spots."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a throwback to the mirrored ceiling/neon lit days of old Vegas??  This place is AWESOME!  From the huge breakfast portions, to the breakfast bloody marys, to the waitresses (I swear ours was a stripper at nite!).  The BEST part of this place, the fireside lounge!  Straight out of an '70s porn set/ night club scene!  I LOVE IT!!!

The food was pretty good, country fried steak & eggs, how can you go wrong?  And how would you know if it was wrong because its smothered in yummy gravy!  The corned beef hash was pretty good, nice and salty.  The one flop of the meal was someone's peppermill omelet.  Otherwise, the steak and eggs were good, as were the pancakes.  Another goodie was the Bloody Mary that was brought out by the drink hostess in a long black evening dress @ 10AM.  FUN!

All in all a fun experience!"}
{"text":"Have you seen the movie Jackie Brown? Well, I feel like I am living inside that movie when I step into the Peppermill. It makes me feel like a 70's badass.

If you like pink neon lights, disco balls and dusty fake plants, you are in for a treat! 

I personally prefer the fireside lounge, I am not a big fan of the restaurant, mostly because the food is basically Denny's but twice the price, but the bar is another story.

If you get to the lounge early enough, then you will be lucky enough to sit in the velvet pie slice benches around the fire coming out from a water feature. This is the place to be! 

I love their drinks, there are delicious and well priced. The fancy waitresses wearing prom gowns are very friendly and attentive.  

I love their pineapple mojitos! I can't wait to go back! This is as Vegas as it could possibly get."}
{"text":"I'm always sceptical of restaurants with a legendary reputation.  In my experience, no celebrated eatery ever lives up to its hype.

But Peppermill is not just a restaurant -- it's a taste bud energy field pulsating around the tongue and soul of Las Vegas.

The food?  A Bellagio fountain of flavour.  The portions?  Bigger than Lake Mead.  The service?  DeNiro would blush.  The ambience?  A neon chic vibe that zipped me back to 1957.

Peppermill is the ultimate Sin City jackpot."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have since I got married right next door in the Riviera over 30 years ago. Great food"}
{"text":"Great place to visit when you hit Vegas at 2 AM, good breakfast, bloody mary, awesome...and the staff is always great.  Also a great place to people watch in the wee hours.  Not cheap."}
{"text":"Food portions are huge upfront.  Fireside could not be more Old Vegas, Swinger cool."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 20+ years. Always great bloody Mary's and consistent food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The first thing I think of when someone mentions this place is the movie Night at the Roxbury.. and there's nothing specific about the establishment or the movie.. it's just the whole thing.  The neon lights, colors, the carpet.. booths... the whole nine.  It's so weird, and that's why people love it.  We were out late and wanted breakfast so we came here, the food is basic diner food, the portions were huge, the wait was kind of long but it was super super busy, and it was painfully cold inside.  I was so sad I forgot my sweater, but wasn't expecting to need it when it's triple digits outside during the day."}
{"text":"Classic and vintage dining in Vegas. Their menu looks like a catalog because there's so many choices. Our favorite is ending the meal with a hot fudge sundae. This is a place we found thanks to so many locals suggesting it."}
{"text":"I have ALWAYS had a great experience here and being that it's open 24 hours a day AND it's Kid friendly, makes it really convenient for us. The decor is fun and electric (literally ELECTRIC)! It's great late night comfort food, especially when you've been drinking and partying all night...er.. when you DON'T have the kids, of course!
Okay so my review is for May 2010 when we visited here. It was our first night in Las Vegas and a first time bringing a child and...me being 7 months pregnant (so no partying for me this time! I was craving steak and was VERY skeptical about ordering it at a place like this. I ordered the New York ! New York ! 27.95 (yes, the price is quite high) ***PEPPERMILL DESCRIPTION: 12oz. hand-cut and trimmed, flame-broiled to perfection and served with sautéed mushrooms.*** Let me tell you that for someone that actually does NOT consider herself a red meat lover and eats it only on rare occassions (even though all my reviews seem to be centered on steak houses and burger joints LOL!), THIS WAS EXCELLANT EXCELLANT EXCELLANT! The kitchen staff really know their steaks! I thought there was a bone in it and kept eating around it...it was all cut with no bone! And being pregnant I had to order it more cooked than I would usually so I believe I got it Medium-Well...still amazing! Flavorful AND tender! So 5 stars there!
On another night (with our little one), we went just for dessert and ordered the Strawberry Shortcake 6.95
***PEPPERMILL DESCRIPTION: Moist slices of pound cake, a generous helping of strawberries and creamy French vanilla ice cream, all topped with real whipping cream.*** WHAT A TREAT! Fantastic! LOVED IT! We were all so tired and our little boy started getting cranky and fighting over bites and finally it ended up toppeling all over the table! Haha, it was a fun night. We love the Peppermill! ***Don't forget to wave to the kitchen staff on your way out. They REALLY appreciate that. :)
FIRESIDE LOUNGE: When my man and I go to Las Vegas as adults, we LOVE the Fireside Lounge in all it's glowing ambiance! The drinks are fun, the hostesses are beautiful and elegant and they are always nice about taking our picture by the molten fire pit, hehe. The only thing I am sad about are the TV's they put in. They are  really distracting. If anyone knows the owners there, PLEASE tell them to take them out!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice (1 amazing and 1 horrible) I am scared to go a 3rd time. 

the first time I came the food was amazing, the servers were pleasant and I enjoyed my time. The theme here is very retro and bright. I enjoy it! 

The portions are huge (omelettes have 10 eggs, why not just make it a dozen lol) 

The 2nd time I went to the fire lounge had a bloody mary, and was seated with the same server again who was just as amazing as the 1st time. However the food was not as good. We ordered cheese sticks which were good and the nachos. I have heard the legend of these nachos and I will NEVER order them again. I got them and the beans that came on the side tasted and smelled rotten. I almost threw up! It took me 25 minutes to waive down the server when she finally came and we told her the beans were bad she took it to the kitchen, came back and said there was a problem with the beans. WELL maybe she should have checked on other tables to make sure they dont eat rotten beans. 

I am nervous to go back because I dont know if it is going to be good or bad the 3rd time I go."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, service is excellent, I love the decor and theme! Bar lounge is very cool.. Music is cool, I highly recommend the pepper mill ..."}
{"text":"Though we have been going to The Peppermill Restaurant for more than 30 years, this is the first time I have checked in and reviewed on Yelp.

The Peppermill has been a 'must go' and honestly excellent choice for dining any time of day for us.

The restaurant has beautiful Tiffany lamps over each table that were made for the Peppermill specifically.  I wanted to buy one, but sadly, they are originals and made for the restaurant only. I LOVE the lamps!  They add to the ambience, along with the other lighting that reminds me of the beautiful past of Las Vegas. 

The menu is amazing, offering a multitude of choices for breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner and all day dining.

We usually show up right after the lunch rush, when it is a little less busy.  It's a little less busy, but less likely to have to wait for a table.

The meals we chose this time were different than the usual eggs Benedict and Lorraine Omelet, or Cobb salad.  We went off the normal grid and went for sandwiches.  The menu has SO MANY things to offer, it takes a few minutes [or more] to decide.

I chose the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich on sourdough bread, sans onions and with cottage cheese instead of fries and it was delicious!  The sandwiches are HUGE and more than enough to share.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection, and exactly as I ordered.  

Hubby chose the Peppermill Club sandwich, which is served with huge crispy onion rings.  Again, delicious and enough to share. It was absolutely EXCELLENT!

We were lucky enough to be in Vegas longer so on our second visit, our friend went along and ordered the pancakes. They are, like everything at the Peppermill, huge and enough to share.  Served with multiple choices of toppings, a side of eggs and choice of meat, it's a meal that will take you through the day, and again, enough to share.

I branched out on that second visit and went for the French Dip sandwich on sourdough bread, which is served with Au Jus and I chose the sweet potato fries to go with the meal. It was absolutely amazing!  Again, enough to share and more than I could possibly eat in one seating.

Hubby ordered the Peppermill Bloody Mary and said it was also wonderful.

The service is impeccable.  From the minute people are seated, they are greeted with a refreshing glass of water and offered drinks while guests have the time to peruse the menu, which genuinely does take some time to decide; so many choices!  All cooked to order and FRESH!

Honestly, we have literally been there at least 100 times since The Peppermill opened.  Collage French Toast is delicious, and my kids favorite. There are so many different things we've enjoyed over the years, and have always had a great time.

The Fireside Bar is set away from the main dining area and features an awesome fire pit lounge seating area for enjoying quite conversations, and a main bar seating area.  It's calming and beautiful.

Going to Vegas?  The Peppermill is something to make sure is on your 'must go,' list.  Hands down, one of the very best places to dine."}
{"text":"Wife and I needed a decent food spot that wouldn't bankrupt us, so we tried here and were pleasantly surprised. Walking in the restaurant scared me abit because I thought we entered a strip club on accident.

We were seated promptly and given our drinks. The waitress was friendly and aided us in finding good choices on the menu. I ordered a sandwich called the conquest, and it was good. Loaded with various meats and toppings, you won't be leaving hungry. The portion sizes of the food are more than adequate for the cost.

The only downside I had was they were out of bud light, even though they had a giant banner advertising a special on the front of the building. I was happy with the experience though and will return."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want 24 hour diner food in Vegas. I have been here on two separate trips now and the food was great. For as many staff members as they have, the service seems to be a little bit behind, but not lacking to the point that you are annoyed. They have full bar service 24 hours a day as well with cocktail waitress service. You can get breakfast, lunch, or even just drinks. It is located toward the end of the strip near the stratosphere so it is a cab ride away if you are staying anywhere else on the strip."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was not very good. First off I had to ask for my server to come to our table. I got a kids meal for my baby which was the pasta. I asked for the meat sauce and the spaghetti sauce was spicy, I'm sure most kids don't want spicy food. The manager came and said yeah the sauce is kinda spicy so it was barely even eaten and I looked confuse because what restaurant feed kids spicy food. I told them to take the food cause my baby didn't want to eat it but I will still pay for it but they insisted that I don't have to pay for it. Then they came back rushing us out asking if we want a to go box, when we were still eating and drinking, how rude is that !! Our server was talking to her boyfriend a table just right in front of us and I have to try to get her attention every time we needed something. But the manager at that time was kind of pushing us to leave which was rude."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on a Monday night. Got in right away wasn't very crowded at all. Well my wife decided she was not that hungry so we shared the Fish and Chips out of all things. Caesar salad was good and so was the fish. Came with a ton of curly fries. Thought it was worth the price. I would definitely come back again and at least try for breakfast. The night we went they only accepted cash and our waitress took forever to take our order and then get me the check. She was busy hanging out with friends at another table, very irritating as we needed the check to get to go to a show."}
{"text":"I used to go here fairly often when I worked nights. It's a great place to grab a late/early meal with friends. Large portions, reasonably priced, cool retro lighting."}
{"text":"I was introduced to the Peppermill by a good friend who is a Vegas local. He brought me here for the first time in May 2016. Now on my 6th Vegas trip of 2016, I've made it a point to come in and have breakfast at least one of the mornings I am here. I've come to Vegas with different people on most of my trips this year and have always brought them here and they enjoy it too. Love the casual, fun ambiance and culture of the restaurant. Can definitely say my favorite meal is the French Toast Collage and a nice big Mimosa from the bar."}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah it's Vegas & I get it's gonna be pricey, but $30 for two vodka red bulls in the lounge while we waited for our table is a bit pricey for a restaurant. 

When we were seated, we were greeted by the complimentary photographer right away. It took a little longer for the server but they were busy so no big deal. We were on vacation anyway, who's in a hurry? 

Bloody mary & corned beef hash and eggs for me. 

Both were delicious & the plate of food was HUGE! 

Not a bad spot."}
{"text":"I mean, it's the PEPPERMILL! If you haven't been here before this is the quintessential Vegas greasy spoon. I have been here several times to satisfy my LATE night drunkin' hankerings for the best breakfast in Vegas. This was the first time that I actually came during normal business hours for a 10am Saturday breakfast. The food didn't disappoint. However, there were huge crowds that I'm not used to seeing (although it will be almost full at 3am on a Wednesday). There was almost an hour wait for a party of two. The secret here is to look for openings at the kitchen bar. It is first come first served. We put our names on the list and then I immediately noticed that there were two seats open at the bar. We sat down and were able to immediately order. We enjoyed our food and paid our bill while people that were on the list before us were still waiting to be seated. They don't take reservations so if you're coming with a large group on a weekend be prepared for a decent wait."}
{"text":"We saw they had a happy hour so we decided to check it out, as the night before when we walked by it was jammin.  We had the happy hour specials.  They give you alot of food.   It was my husband, my 2 kids (9/11)  We had ordered 2 chicken strips and fries, sliders, buffalo wings, bruchessetta, and cheese sticks!  and the kids had drinks, and we had the Bicardi dreamsicle (Definitely recommend).  We had leftover food.  The chicken strips are the size of a hand.  My son and I could of shared a plate!   My daughter loved her wings.  It was a great value for all the food!  Our bill was $85 with tip!   the staff is friendly and fast.  The ambience was great as well!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch. Free parking in lot. Wait time was zero as we got seated immediately. Service was good . Water tasted a little chlorine aroma. Breakfast foods or sandwiches were menu picks. Food items tasted good and nice presentation. Food seems to be a good value."}
{"text":"Really good food and a great selection.  Love their hash browns.  I really enjoy the service as well.  I appreciate that they take drink orders right away.  This is a place I frequent when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Busting at the seams!!  I highly advise that you share a plate.  All of the plates are HUGE portions.  I'm a repeat offender and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"If you ever wondered why people are sooo fat go to this restaurant. Slap my thigh but damn are the portions huge. That aside, looks like a 70's night club, great service, alcohol 24/7 of course. Funny though going to breakfast feeling like shit and being served a cocktail with your pancakes by a girl in a evening dress.  

Yes its on the strip but further up by circus circus on your right. Lots of parking,"}
{"text":"Ham steak is the best I've ever eaten!  Won't even bother ordering anything else."}
{"text":"Best Southern Country fried steak ever! they give a good amount of gravy too not shady on it :) mine came with fresh blueberry muffin! it tasted like it came fresh out the oven! :)
My BF got  the biscuits and gravy is it was amazing too.
Their Cream of mushroom soup is one of the best I've had.
One of my favorite breakfast diners in vegas :)"}
{"text":"Burgers and garlic fries are the best. Huge food portions. Fun atmosphere. Great place a lot of locals go to. As a bar in the back. Service is mediocre at bests."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, HUGE, HUGE, HUGE portions...share, share, share.  Decor is well......strange. Great food, a must experience. Just strange setup."}
{"text":"I had breakfast this morning, it was one of the best breakfast I've had in a long time. The prices seem expensive but the portions are huge, and everything is cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"A crazy retro dinner with great ambiance. The portions are huge and very good. The 24 hour breakfast menu is highly recommended."}
{"text":"When in Vegas and you are really hungry the Peppermill is your place. Tons of great food options and the portions are huge. We eat there all the time and never disappointed.  Open 24hours and the service is great."}
{"text":"Yeah this place is still Crazy Sexy Vegasy Cool! 40 years now! It's one of the very few free standing restaurants on LVBLVD.  

Crazy: Faux plants and cherry blossom trees everywhere. They got Tiffany lamps with pink flamingos...what's even crazier that it's still shiny new. The place does not look dated. AT ALL. Oh and not one speck of dust or dirt. The whole place is pristine. They've got someone assigned to sweep the carpet even.

Sexy: Waitresses still don the cute mini dress uniforms and the cocktail waitresses still wear long dresses with the high leg slits. Cozy circular purple velour booths. It all still looks like what I remember when I used to frequent the Peppermill lounges back in the day with my hot date aka Mr. B. 

Vegasy Cool: Disco day glo colors of purple, pink and teal. Just the whole late 70's early 80's era theme still preserved. Fun, showy and flashy. I love it!
 
Oh yeah the food: Everything on the menu, served 24/7! Darn it, they didnt preserve the 70's prices but at least the prices not as high like they charge at strip resorts.But not Denny's cheap either. Our meal came out to pretty much what we pay for two lunches,drinks and dessert $40 something  ..not bad at all.  Along with breakfast, they also have sandwiches, burgers, salads and pasta.

My tradition was always ordering breakfast and a banana split late night! I still do. The serving portions are still ginormous.  2 scoops each of Vanilla, Chocolate and Strawberry ice cream. That's enough to share w/3 more people according to our server.
 
Service: Great! Especially since it was fairly busy.
 
We had a real pleasant time here and will most likely be back."}
{"text":"The food is average, but the portions are large. The French toast was decent and the sausages are huge and pretty delicious. Some cocktails were fairly to poorly made."}
{"text":"Good food great drinks!! .. The wait can be long sometimes but it's very well worth it! Try a Bloody Mary for an hangover ;) or a coronarita! Great and interesting decor! The front hostess was rude.. And our friend got a beer spilled on him.. Other than that it was great lol..."}
{"text":"The first brunch place we have found out in Vegas and we both loved it. The Turkish sausage with three eggs and hashed potatoes as well as the halfed banana were what we have ordered. The size was so huge that eventually we end up with sharing and could not finish the icecream. Waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and pimp Vegas decor!

Let's begin this review by saying - if you haven't been here, you're missing out!

This place is open 24/7. Located on the strip, near Encore & Wynn. Fireplace lounge (don't miss this part) perfect for cold Vegas nights. Great early & late happy hour specials. Crazy colors & lights everywhere. Extensive cocktail menu. Breakfast served all day & night. HUGE desserts perfect for sharing. Great diner food with something for everyone.

In a nutshell this is a Vegas classic and just a fun spot. Be prepared to be dazzled..."}
{"text":"Okay, the decor is awful and cheesy (but I guess that is part of the fun as well as a statement that the times may change, but Peppermill doesn't out of some sense of righteousness, laziness, and/or lack of funds).  They make the waitresses wear these awful, ugly uniforms (it reminds me of the flair Jennifer Aniston had to put up with in Office Space).

We went here for breakfast, and it wasn't actually okay.  The omelettes and pancakes were both good.  And for breakfast, it is a little different food and atmosphere than you get in the buffets on the mostly Disney-fied Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"This review is for the Fireside Lounge only as we didn't eat in the restaurant portion.  Loved the intimate couches and fireplaces.  The couches are done in swanky pink/purple velvet.  Total throwback to the 70s.  Our waitress was friendly and gave us some good drink recommendations.  It's a great place for an after dinner drink and intimate conversation.  They give you complimentary honey roasted nuts and aren't quick to rush you out or bother you too much."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the server, Nellie, was wonderful. The food was very well made as well. Unfortunately, due to the unprofessional and extremely rude attitude of the manager on duty at the time, Peggy, I have to give this establishment 1 star.

While in the restroom, a male employee opened the door and said \"Lady, I have to clean\"  and added something along the lines of telling me to hurry up. 

I went up to the host podium and politely asked to speak with a manager. Peggy said that she was the manager, so I told her that I appreciate the fact that they keep their restroom cleans for their guests. However, having a male employee open the door and ask you to hurry up is unsettling and was an unpleasant experience. 

Peggy then proceeded to tell me that he couldn't have said that to me because, \"he doesn't even speak English\". I responded by stating he knew enough to stay that. I can excuse the way he said that, knowing that there was in fact a language barrier. That's fine, I am not saying anything poor in regards to his work ethic. It's hard to work somewhere where the predominant language is not your own. 

However, to be told he didn't say that to me, is condescending, unprofessional and rude. A manager should never speak that way to a guest and they definitely should not end the conversation, which was civil (I wasn't yelling or making a scene, I was simply telling her it was an off putting encounter), by then walking away without another word. 

It wasn't busy. At that time, there was only one couple waiting to be seated. If I was the owner, this woman would never be representing their establishment. Such an unfortunate situation because everything else from the food to the decor was lovely."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the good food. If you are very hungry they ll feed you like a wolf. I just didn't give 5 stars cuz there was a lady taking photos and selling them to you but first she introduced herself as being part of the restaurant deal but she ended up being an outside vendor. After offering me a free deal she presented a set of photos to be purchased. I think the manager at Peppermill should have prevented to warn customers from this kind of unwanted visits while you are eating at the table."}
{"text":"Great old Vegas favorite.  Big menu, large portions,tasty food, attentive service, retro surroundings equals five stars"}
{"text":"Ordered the French Dip and it was okay.  The biscuts and gravy were mediocre and the French Toast was good.  Very large portions."}
{"text":"Wow what a find! My wife and I took a walk up \"The Strip\" from Wynn and we stumbled across this place for breakfast. The portions are great and the food was outstanding! It is diner type food, but a bit higher style and quality.

Very nice change of pace as far as price/service goes from the options in the hotels! We felt very welcomed by the staff. 

We would recommend this to anyone staying on the North or Mid points on \"The Strip\"; It's an easy walk and on the east side of the road."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excited I finally found where I will bring all my friends and family for breakfast or late night treat. Large portions / cooked precisely / we had 3 servers, one didn't speak English. The seating is great you don't feel crowded and you feel like you are in your own private place. The servers need to tell the guests \"you pay at the front\". The bathrooms were discussting, over flooded toilet and stalls out of toilet paper / clearly this area needs more attention, it's dive bar gross."}
{"text":"What a cool place!  The Peppermill, particularly the Fireside lounge portion, is like being transported back to 70s Vegas.  Lots of neon lights and plush seating.  They have a cool water based fire pit.  Hard to describe but very cool. Its a nice lounge to order drinks while you wait to be seated to eat.  The restaurant portion is also very unique with fake plants making it feel like your eating in some odd cross between the jungle and a Dennys. For food, you get a ton of food for your buck.  So its awesome by any measure. The food itself wont blow you away but its solid fare. I ordered biscuits and gravy and its a TON of biscuits and gravy.  I got sides of eggs and hashbrowns (if you want it crispy I recommend you ask for that as mine were kinda soft) and I couldn't finish half.  While we were there we tried both the mimosas and the bloody marys (if you get an extra shot, then its def a stout drink!) and we enjoyed both.  Our service at both the lounge and the restaurant was excellent. Our waitress was particularly good and on top of her game.  The peppermill is def a gem that will recommend to others looking for good food after a hard night, or morning, of drinking and gambling."}
{"text":"A new favorite hotspot in Vegas! Their food is decent, but their real claim to fame is that fabulous firepit with waitress service. Sipping a mai tai or bloody mary sitting fireside was a wonderful experience with a great group of friends. I could have sat there all day. Check it out after grabbing a bite, since the lounge doesn't have a full menu like inside."}
{"text":"Everyone was super friendly. It took our waiter forever to come though. It was fine, they were packed so we were understanding. My daughter ordered a kids meal and I ordered an adult entree. My entree came with a chicken noodle soup. It was good. So good, that my daughter ate that and was full by the time her own food came out (which was a ridiculously huge portion by the way). I had the New york steak dinner with mashed potatoes and mushrooms. My mashed potatoes were awful. My mushrooms were too garlicky, unedibley garlicky and my steak was plain. Lucky for them that is how i like my steak because it has no flavor, none. my aunt had some kind of fusilli pasta with pancetta and tomatoes, which was very good. the best thing anyone at the table ordered actually. and it was way overpriced for what we got. I know the portions are huge, but i would have gladly had a smaller meal with a smaller price tag. half of our meal got tossed because we couldn't finish it anyway. live and learn."}
{"text":"A way out there neighborhood spot with a HUGE menu and HUGE portions. Food was ok, could have been a bit warmer. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Ok ok ok.  I know.  But this place has my heart.  It's a Vegas staple.  It's like the best late night eats.  Everything you could want or need on the menu, fancy cocktail waitresses in long gowns delivering crazy drinks,  and the adjacent fireside lounge where old people go to make out. Who wouldn't give 5 stars?

I come here often,  as it's in between my work,  my gym,  my drinking spots,  and my house lol. I've been disappointed a few times by eggs not done right,  but hey,  they put up with a TON of drunk and disorderly tourists on a nightly basis.  

 My recommendations on the menu include almost anything breakfast,  the chicken wings,  the French dressing that you can get in the side salad, the cottage cheese and...omg... the Sin City BLT. Dude,  this thingis so delish.  It's a BLT made on extra yummy Texas toast,  with thick cut bacon,  lettuce,  tomato,  and...a fried egg with pesto aoli....damn! That sandwich is so good! Hits all the spots.  Breakfast,  lunch,  and dinner cravings all in one meal."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorite places to go ANYTIME in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I have been here before, but this was the first time for my parents. They and we absolutely love the food here. Good price and huge portion sizes. This is a great place for family and friends and the staff is also excellent. If you are in the city and need a place to eat that kind if takes you back to old Vegas, this is your stop."}
{"text":"Have seen the place over the years of working in, or just visiting Las Vegas.  Finally decided to try it after reading all the reviews.  I enjoyed the look of the place, and the lounge is small, but kind of cool.

Don't know what all the 5 stars are for, perhaps for the look of the establishment, couldn't have been for the food.  The food was just okay.  I ordered eggs, sausage links and hash browns (they don't serve home fried potatoes - what a shame).  I was disappointed that the sausage links are turkey.  They also tasted like nasty.  My hash brown potatoes were cold.

Our service was terrible.  Our waitress seemed to prefer spending more time at other tables than ours.  I never got that second cup of coffee I asked for during the meal, only when I asked for the check did she ask if I still wanted more coffee.  Really?  We also asked for extra napkins and condiments, and towards the very end of our meal they came.  

One last thing.  I ordered a Bloody Mary at the lounge while waiting to eat breakfast.  For the price, you'd think it would be fantastic.  Not.  Plain tomato juice and a splash of booze.  It tasted like I was drinking plain tomato juice.  I was very, very disappointed, sitting in those very, very uncomfortable chairs at the bar.

My overall opinion is to stay away from the place, as it serves up food just a notch below Denny's.  It's bloody Mary's are terrible.  Both the food and the drinks are overpriced for what you're receiving, especially compared to other restaurants.  The service was for me terrible, especially when noticing that how they treat you like shit, then dote on others around you.      If you're going to cook and serve food, at least cook and serve it the same for each customer.  Not specific ones.

They seem to pat themselves on the back for having a restaurant with a lounge that has survived there for awhile (just an observation from the menu).  All I have to say is people are idiots if they keep coming back.  Over priced food and drinks.  Underwhelming flavor.  Terrible service.  Trust me, you'd be better off at McDonald's."}
{"text":"I really don't remember everything about this experience. It was early morning after partying in Vegas! I do remember how yummy the food was though.. I always love a good eggs Benedict when I can barely walk. Fun times. When I came out of the restaurant the sun was rising. The next thing I remember was waking up in my tight room at Aria!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Vegas for breakfast or lunch. Tasty chicken fried steak, poached eggs and waffles. My favorite is the walnut creek salad with Bartlett pears, Mandarin oranges, cranberries, fresh greens, walnuts and chicken breast. Always fresh and delicious. If you go on the weekend, be prepared to wait. Excellent service every time."}
{"text":"The only real reason that someone could give this classic eatery any rating other than 5 Stars, is that it stays so busy there may be a wait for a seat.  In my opinion this is the best restaurant in town and is where the locals go daily.  Menu is huge and the service friendly and fast.  Where else can you get traditional Corned Beef Hash with 3 poached eggs on top, a huge side of potatoes and a muffin for under $10.00.  And I promise you will be taking half of the order home with you.  A Classic in every sense and a sure stop for me when in town."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! Make sure you are hungry, the portions are huge, 8 eggs omelet!!! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Since we had a evening flight, we decided a decent meal and rest for a long next day was best. I had not been to Peppermill since 2009. So I checked the Yelp Las Vegas and Instagram reviews and it got a green light. We spied on the table close to the door and the \"Nachos, Nachos, Nachos\" with Ground Beef looked amazing! So of course we checked reviews and ordered the \"Nachos, Nachos, Nachos\" as well. Now let me tell you were it went wrong: Our server insisted that the Ground Beef was way too greasy and we should get it with Chicken. That my IG friends was a HUGE mistake! The chicken was flavorful, but it was a mountain of cheese, chicken, and some of the strongest white onions I have encountered in a couple months. We had to ask for the refried beans and got no Sour Cream or Guacamole. We regretted not ordering the Greasy Ground Beef!  The Burgers were very good: Pastrami Burger and PepperMill Burger...burgers were seasoned well, not overcooked, and bread was fresh. I will good back next year, but for breakfast. ____

The food is ginormous portions .
I was told I could not order a junior menu which was the only option on the menu with 1 egg and bacon 
The rude waitress said it was not her rule 
But because I was not a junior I was turned away .
How crazy is that ? A restaurant denies you food because they do not have a smaller option
Would not recommend this service ."}
{"text":"Was there for breakfast, the food wasnt that good actually so I was a bit dissapointed, had very high hopes for this place.
The decor is super 80's and fun. The prices are on the + side but so are the portions.
Maybe next time I visit I will only go to the lounge area, skip the rest."}
{"text":"Late-night eats, retro Vegas style! The massive multi-page menu of diner-style food has something for everyone- but portions are so large you can easily share. If you want to get your drink on, the Lounge menu has cocktails.

Leave your diet at home and get a bunch of apps to share- the nachos are huge and the wings are meaty. If you want to be somewhat healthy, they have tons of salads. The side spinach salad has bacon and hard-boiled egg with a zesty French dressing. The fish and chips are huge and juicy, served with a mountain of curly fries. In the winter, get their hot chocolate with whipped cream for a sweet treat.

Service is friendly, they also have an in-house photographer who walks around. Interior is super fun, with neon lights, built-in trees, and large, cushy booths. Food comes out fast despite the crowds, but you're best off coming on a weeknight to avoid the drunk tourists."}
{"text":"I practically grew up in New Jersey diners, so to see a diner laced with Las Vegas DNA was quite a sight. The Peppermill is precisely what it ought to be as a classic diner - giant menu, stainless steel exterior, breakfast all day. But it also has a full bar, a photographer and a clientele that is clearly a mix of locals, people starting their day, and people ending their day.

I tried the gyro (excellent), the onion rings (excellent) and an omelette (also excellent). They play the favorites and do them well. I strongly recommend a visit. You will have more fun there than any buffet on the Strip."}
{"text":"Its been 10 years since I'd come here and this joint did not dissapoint! My in-laws were so impressed we cancelled Hells Kitchen reservations so we could eat there another night. Love the Sin City BLT. Pancakes are amazing. Be sure to check out the lounge. Really cool Vegas mainstay."}
{"text":"Ordered a BLT, waited nearly an hour, no word from the waiter, finally left. I get when it can get busy. The waiter did not care, which is a problem."}
{"text":"this place is amazing the best bloody mary's in town. and my french toast was deelish. Gotta check out the bar lounge, it has a really cool fireplace to sit around and snuggle"}
{"text":"Was there a few years ago. Word of mouth. That was a smart mouth! Super cool place. Great food. Will not ever go to Vegas without going there."}
{"text":"This is the first time we ate at the Peppermill. From the outside it looks like a 1950s diner. Once you get inside other reviews called it a Denny's wannabe while others compare the decorating to a cruise ship. I think both of those descriptions are appropriate, only in a very positive way. Our server came to the table right away. She took our drink orders and answered questions about the menu. The couple we went with had there before. They warned us about the size of the portions and so we decided to share a salad. Boy that was enough. We had the steak salad. They prepared the steak perfectly. Volume of food was huge. We certainly did not leave hungry. I would recommend this restaurant for an informal meal at a very reasonable price. Don't expect anything fancy. But the food is good and I will plan to go back again."}
{"text":"AWESOME, AMAZING, DELICIOUS, A LOT! We visited this place three times because it was so yummy. We had the largest pancakes I've ever seen. The best omelet called the Marzarti which the highlight is the spaghetti sauce and the sour dough toast. I can say I'm not a late person but I ate almost the whole 8 egg omelet with the SAUCE. Also, their sampler is delic which we sub the shrimp out for curly fries. The wings are great, even the next day. WE WILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best local late night hangouts in Vegas! Whenever friends or family come to town I make sure to take them to the fire pit room."}
{"text":"Great Food!!  Kooky Atmosphere!!  A must-try when you're in Sin City!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I don't care that it's a landmark. Everything is expensive and tastes mediocre at best."}
{"text":"You can't complete the Vegas trip if you don't visit this restaurant! . Foods are always amazing. The best chicken wings and French toast !!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast on our way out of town this morning. I was pleasantly surprised to find ample parking for a full sized pickup even though they were busy. After a 10 min wait, we were treated with a huge breakfast. Yes, it's traditional fare, but the food was great and the service exceptional."}
{"text":"Are here everyday for a week and found something amazing every time. The menu has everything. And those hot muffins are ooey gooey greatness."}
{"text":"The Maserati omelet was to die for! The \"hot\" blueberry muffin as my wife said was \"hot, hot, hot!!\""}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I'm vegan and they accommodate me :) me and friends always come here for a late nice snack our waitress was really pretty and nice her name was Krystal"}
{"text":"After a very long wait we were pleased to see generous portions. Had a burger and gyro, overall pretty good. Service was a little lacking but they were slammed so understood. Breakfasts are definitely big enough to share!"}
{"text":"Meh. A little on the greasy side. Went for breakfast and the portions were ginormous. The food was decent, on par with Denny's or Coco's, aside of the huge portions. I'm a fan of the large coffee mugs though."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. It's amazing!!! If u go for breakfast, there's almost always a line but who cares when u can wait in there bar lounge. It's decor is so 80's and it's cool. It's definitely different. The bagels with jam is unbelievably delicious as well as their Bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"Love this place food big portions and not over priced staff super nice. Love the atmosphere the neon light remind me of the 80's"}
{"text":"This place is so strange! A fireside lounge on one side and a diner-style restaurant on the other?! This review is for the restaurant only.

The fake trees and flowers and colorful lights are a bit cheesy, but I really like it! Makes for beautiful pictures! There's also a guy coming around to the tables taking pictures trying to get you to buy them. They're super cute, but does anyone actually buy those?!

The portions are HUGE HUGE HUGE. The two of us couldn't finish an omlette, a bowl of clam chowder, and a milkshake! Hell, we only finished half of it! We're big eaters too x_x I don' remember which omlette we ordered, but it had a lot of meat and it was okay at first but pretty sickening after a while. The vanilla shake was good. It's the thick kind, which usually isn't my thing. Clam chowder was way too salty and just not good. I think a can of Campbell's Chunky clam chowder is 100x better! 

I think the Peppermill would be a perfect late night filler, but I don't think I'd come here again unless I was seeking out drunk food."}
{"text":"Great \"diner\". Huge portions. Usually service is good. Perfect hangover food. I love this place."}
{"text":"Legit!  This place is super cool. I really felt like I had a genuine Vegas experience coming to this restaurant. The portions are huge! I know, don't complain and it's what I should expect. I couldn't finish everything and it's hard for me to waste food. 
Loved it"}
{"text":"A Vegas Classic. This place is like a mullet, business up front, party in the back.  The front restaurant is pretty much a \"Denny's\" but the back has late night bar food, sunken booths with a fire pit and old school decor with neon lights and probably the original lights from 1980.  So fun!

The food is exactly what you would expect, bar food.  Good quality but bar food nonetheless."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to the Peppermill tonight. I was highly disappointed. After waiting 40-45 minutes for 2 BLTs we walked out. The waiter disappears and could not care about our order. Other tables near us complained of slow service."}
{"text":"24 hour diner with classic 70's -80's? theme. Portions are large and shareable for 2 people.

Chicken quesadilla: 6 pieces that comes with sour cream and salsa sauce. Good! Taste just like a chicken quesadilla. No complaints.

Hash Browns: Not as crispy as I wanted it to be. I wouldn't order it as a side next time.

I wouldn't mind coming back here again to try some more dishes. The omelettes look really good."}
{"text":"We made it a point to beat the breakfast crowd n hit the road earlier in fear of Vegas hostage-style traffic on the desert stretch. Much better this time but still spotty service... our server was there and then she couldn't be found. Depending on where they tuck you, coffee guys may not circulate often either.

Anyway, still had a good time n received yet another complimentary souvenir pic. If you're not too hungry, consider sharing cuz portions are huge. I got the Joe's SF Scramble and hubs ordered the Maserati Omelette. Both were good, but I felt like we could've shared one and still had leftovers. No joke, they're serious about feeding you."}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas many times. It was my very first time. Reminds me of vintage Vegas. I suggest when waiting for your table head out to the fireside lounge. At first I was thrown off by the decor. It's like neon Vegas meets outdoor indoor look. They couldn't  decide what Look they wanted I guess. 
Food: Portions are huge. I had a pina colada and a turkey sausage, hash brown potatoes, scramble eggs with bread. I wish my colada was bigger lol 
My sister had a Belgian waffle with syrup. They give a lot of syrup. 
It's like Denny's with reasonable prices but tastier and better."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Peppermill Las Vegas for our 11th Wedding Anniversary celebration. Our plan was to spend a couple of hours for our dining experience. We were promptly greeted by several people who were trying to make our dining experience amazing. We were promptly brought bread and menus. My wife ordered Chicken and Red Pepper Pasta which was amazing. I ordered the Ribeye steak, medium. It was brought to me cooked medium well or more done. My server asked to take it back. When she brought it back, it was cooked properly but was about 20% gristle and fat. The menu price listed for the steak was $32.95 but I was charged $36.95. Our out price was almost $90 and the main course of my meal was not only aweful, but by the time I finally received my properly cooked steak, I only had time to cut the fat and gristle off of it but not enough time to eat it because of an event that we had planned. The server was awesome and very apologetic. A nice lady came by and took our picture and gave us one with a very sweet note on the back.  Although all of the people were very nice and the restaurant was very welcoming, the overpricing from the listed menu price and the terrible and very expensive grisly and fat steak will keep us away.  Thank you, but NO THANKS!"}
{"text":"This place has become a go-to for my family ever since we have bee coming to Vegas! I did not know the reason why growing up, but I know now. 

We recently came here during our Christmas break and dang! Their food is sure tasty, and comes in big portions! So for the price you pay, you definitely get your money's worth. They give you so much food that you can share it with 3 people and STILL be full! Dang. Money's. worth. 

I got their Marco Polo omelet, which was so tasty! Their sauce on top just made it so good, and the omelet is really huge! It comes with hash browns and your choice of bread. We also got their bagels, and woah. The bread was so fresh, that it was easy and smooth to pull apart. It made eating bagels a lot more pleasing. 

Service wise, they are really great at getting to you! We never usually have trouble with service, and that's with saying being an occasional customer for the past 10+ years! It does get crowded, but they usually seat you quickly enough so you don't have to wait long. 

The restaurant is very interesting to look at. Definitely reflects the busy like of Vegas, expect they have trees inside the restaurant. Very weird, but I can deal with it. 

They have their own parking lot, which is great because there is always parking. Woo! 

Come on by here for a great brunch after a night out of turning up at the clubs, or before you start venturing out into Vegas with a full stomach!"}
{"text":"It's always crowded but worth the wait!  The food is big portions so make sure u are hungry!  Waitress on first visit very nice, attentive and prompt service!  Came back 2 days later and the wait was 15-20 min so we waited in the lounge.  Got seated but waited at least 15 minutes for our order to be taken then 15 min later the waitress came and us repeat our order so I guess we waiting longer..  not very happy today.  You can order alcohol but that is a separate tab.  They are known for their bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"Really disappointed after reading rec in USA Today and having locals endorse it. Read others' reviews about juicy burgers; ours were dry but still a bit cold in middle.  I had the pesto burger; everything but the meat was good. My husband's mushroom burger was also dry. Our fries and rings were unremarkable, and it wasn't as inexpensive as I expected. Cool to see inside."}
{"text":"Quintessential Las Vegas! For food the Diner part is open 24/7 to service all your diners cravings food on the most is pretty good. But for a lil more edgy fun come here to the Lounge, grab a few friends sit down by the fire pits order a Scorpian sit back chat and ppl watch! You'll enjoy the low lighting with neon LV strip lights and if you come after the clubbing/show hours maybe seeing your fav Dj's or local performers."}
{"text":"Went to the Peppermill at 11 a.m. on a Sunday while visiting Vegas with the family. There was a 30 minute wait and the place was packed! My husband ordered the beef kabobs, son ordered turkey burger w/sweet potato fries, sister ordered fettuccine with side of fruit, and I ordered eggs, hash browns and biscuits with gravy. Everyone said that the food they ordered was really good and my eggs were cooked perfectly. The service was exceptional! They went above and beyond to accommodate me with a knee scooter (ankle surgery). We visit Vegas for an annual race and will definitely go back! Great food, service and cool decor!"}
{"text":"Portions were huge and the food was really good.  We were actually headed to a different restaurant when our cab driver recommended this one for us to try.  The only off thing was the service.  We only saw our waitress 3 times the entire time we were there and it took her 20 minutes before she came to our table the first time.  Once she came she wanted to take our order and we didn't see her again till she dropped off the food.  After that the only time we saw her again was to bring the check.  We needed more butter and syrup and we couldn't ever find her to get anymore."}
{"text":"Classic. Old School Vegas Gem.

Great food and service.  The Lounge by the fire is one of the best places to hang out and drink with your friends.  We spent \"Super Bowl Saturday\" here.  We relaxed in a big booth by the fire and enjoyed specialty cocktails way into the night.  Then went and rested up for the Big Game in 2004.  Fun times with good friends are where memories are made. 10 years later and I still remember the time....

 Love this place~"}
{"text":"Got to try this old school diner while I was in Vegas over the weekend. It's near Stratosphere so towards the end of the strip. On the outside, it doesn't look like much but when you enter you at first think you are at a strip club! Their neon lights threw me off. They also have fake cherry blossom trees inside. Very eclectic decor. We sat in a booth. 

I had the Pastrami Cheeseburger. A burger with pastrami added. It had the word \"YUM\" at the end of its description and I was sold. You have a choice of a side so I had the onion rings. The burger was definitely good. Very filling to say the least. I couldn't finish my yummy onion rings. They were so crispy just how I like it! I also had their Kiss My Cucumber drink with Hendrick's Gin. A refreshing drink. 

Service was good. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"I ordered the munches breakfast meal and it contained Portuguese sausage, green/red peppers, onions, has browns, and topped with a layer of egg. Side of wheat toast.

It was so DELICIOUS! The hostess and the waitress was very generous and setting is very clean. Despite how busy it was on a Sunday, we was seated very quickly.

The next time I come here I'm trying the country fried steak!

:):):):)"}
{"text":"I love that you have to walk through the diner to get to the bar.
Make yourself comfy on the red naugahyde next to the firepit and get yerself a great big 'ol drink.
Another Vegas favorite of mine. Can't say I've ever actually eaten at the Peppermill though. However, I've had plenty to drink at the Fireside and can definitely say it's tops."}
{"text":"Super busy place on Saturday mornings for breakfast.  Very friendly wait staff.  A bit pricey but normal for the Strip.  Fortunately, the portions are large!  My corned beef hash tasted like it came out of a can and not from a fresh corned beef - which is preferable by my standards!  

A guy comes around and very nicely takes a group photo of your table and prints it on to a free postcard of the Peppermill and then tries to sell you a larger photo for your coffee table.  What the heck - we bought two.  

No casino here.  But just as much old Vegas flash."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at the restaurant which looks like a diner but I have been to the lounge a few times. The lounge is a hidden gem in Vegas. Relaxing couches to enjoy a cocktail on and designed to provide you with enough privacy to make it romantic if you choose. Cocktails are priced fairly so if your in Vegas stop by and enjoy an unexpected treat in the desert..."}
{"text":"Service is AMAZING, food is incredible. My husband had the joes San Francisco favorite, and I had the tostado omelet.  The chili in my omelet was soooooo good and the portion sizes are incredibly large. I also ordered a Hawaiian sunset drink that I finished before I even got my food.  SO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill never fails. It's likely the best 24/7 on the strip, and probably in all of Vegas. The restaurant has the ambience of Charlie Murphy's Hollywood stories with Prince and Rick James. The fireside lounge is a more intimate setting. It has a fire pit surrounded by lounge seating, it's own bar and food menu. Every trip to Vegas deserves a trip to the Peppermill."}
{"text":"We started coming to this restaurant 30 yrs ago when we lived in CA and we've been coming here ever since. It's now a TRADITION for my children and their families as well.  
We've since moved to LV and now bring all our Out-of-Town guest here for their send off breakfast."}
{"text":"This is always my first stop when I get to Vegas.  The atmosphere reminds me of Pulp Fiction.  The food comes in large portions, enough to share, and will leave you filled for the day.  The price is pretty great considering it's vegas.  This place is swanky and my fave."}
{"text":"Ambience leaves much to be desired, and food was basic and bland. Not sure what the draw is unless you're still out at 4AM and need a hangover meal. Definitely wouldn't make an effort to go back."}
{"text":"Grrrrrrrreat breakfast. It was our first time, ever, there and the service and food was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, but more so in the mornings. Be it people stopping there during their walk of shame back to their hotels, locals or out of towners trying to beat those who slept in and opted for the late hotel check out. 
The portions are big and the menu is diverse.  
One thing i would probably stay away from ordering again is the hot chocolate. It was just ok."}
{"text":"Growing up in Marin Co. in Northern CA, there was a Peppermill in the next town.  As a teenager, we'd go in late night for coffee and french fries to gather and gossip.  Lots of good memories for me.  That Peppermill is long gone, but I always indulge when I'm in Vegas.  They are open 24/7.  Want breakfast after an all night bender playing cards in the casinos or a Sundae dessert to drown your sorrows after a March Madness loss?  Go to Peppermill.

Peppermill is a throwback time machine trip to the 70s, and I mean that in the best way possible.  The restaurant decor is plush, comfy booths with neon lighting and the waitresses serve in Playboy bunny-like outfits.  The cocktail waitresses wear polyester evening gowns and serve drinks inside the Fireside lounge with a firepit made of lavarock.  Definitely a \"boom chica wow wow\" vibe.  They are popular at all hours of the day, so don't be surprised if you'll wait a few minutes to be seated.   The secret is out.

Service is excellent.  Coffee is always hot, fresh and bottomless and you'll never go without a refill.  Inclusive of the rainbow sugar dispenser on the table. I indulge in their iced tea.  I learned the serve Teva brand and I am a big fan.  Food is Americana fanfare and you can't go wrong with diner style comfort food.  Burgers are huge and a satisfying portion.   I enjoyed the 3-tier Club Sandwich. Freshly sliced real turkey (not processed lunch meat)  crisp bacon, lettuce and tomatoes served on lightly toasted choice of bread.  So big, you'll most likely take a doggie bag home.  

Peppermill never disappoints  I get good, decently priced mega-quantity food and a time warp visit back to my teenage years, all rolled into one place.   Be sure to visit and get the throwback experience......you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place after seeing all of the glowing reviews, but what I found on a Saturday morning was a generic middle American coffee shop.  Certainly not a bad breakfast option, but not worth a long walk from your hotel, either (if you are at Riviera or Circus Circus, though, check it out). Omelets are huge but filled with too much cheap American cheese, hash browns were rather hard and unappetizing. Maybe I caught them on a bad day...

I liked the blue and purple lighting and the 70's-style round booths. Waitresses wore \"Hawaiian truck stop\" floral print dresses and were exceptionally nice and attentive. Much better service than the average 24-hour hotel restaurant.

Can't comment on the dinner menu or late night experience - I'll have to go back and try it.  Overall I liked the place, and would be more likely to return soon if it weren't a little out of my way."}
{"text":"THE Vegas diner experience. When it's 3am and looking for a Vegas-style late night dinner, this is the spot to go.

Neon? Check! Mirrors everywhere? Check! Free souvenir photo? Check!

Portions are huge and the menu is very extensive, and really, when you end up here at 3am, all the food will taste like Bobby Flay was in the kitchen.

Loved it!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Sucks I don't live in Vegas to go whenever I please. 

This is a must visit destination of your there on business or vacation. Food was amazing."}
{"text":"Old school charm, that's why you go here. The food is meh, it's a diner after all, and best at 3 am after a lot of drinks elsewhere. Speaking of drinks, they have quite a few to choose from, lots of cocktails but unfortunately a rather poor beer selection, only Stella on tap, but they poor it well, so hard to complain. It's got two sides, diner with the full menu, then the \"lounge\" with the water/fire pit. I think your best bet is to go at the end of your night, when you're a little munchy, get a few appetizers and a nightcap then cab it home as the sun comes up."}
{"text":"First I want to say the food during my visit was phenomenal! Great taste and huge portions for a reasonable enough price. I had the chicken fried steak which was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The sausage gravy made it that much better. The mashed potatoes were real potatoes. The veggies were lacking a bit, but still good. 

My only complaint and the reason I give my experience a 4 instead of a 5 was the service. The cocktail waitress were very friendly and courteous, but our waitress seemed to be having the worst day of her life. 

Upon being seated a server brought us our drinks but he wasn't the server. We waited on our server another 10 minutes before I decided to say something. I ask a random server for help and eventually they track down our server, Elisha. I don't want to pile on her as the worst, because she brought out our food fairly quickly. What I didn't like was her attitude. From her \"I guess you're ready to order\" when I asked to for a server to her slamming my change on the table after I paid for our meal. 

In sum, great food but the service is shaped by the server."}
{"text":"In my fam, The Peppermill is a Las Vegas tradition. Growing up my grandparents always stayed at the Sahara (now SLS) and the \"Mill\" was very convenient down the street.  The food was always consistent, the staff friendly and efficient and the place spotless. Even today it does not disappoint. 

On this night the Peppermill, although not busy (weeknight early) hit again on all cylinders.  My tasty club sandwich, fries and a coke were awesomely simple and thoughtfully prepared, as signaled to one of the chefs via a two thumbs and nod from me to which he winked back. 

I was transported to childhood memories with the neon and fake tree decor - and signature colored sugar container on the table - I've never seen that done anywhere else. My Nana actually \"borrowed\" (her words) one of those back in the day via her big fat purse. One of these days I'll buy one since I still feel a twinge of guilt for her actions and I can't find the one she \"borrowed\".

As the North strip continues to evolve I hope the Peppermill will continue its quest to just do what it has always done and do well. Awesome food, campy decor and Las Vegas personality. It knows who it is."}
{"text":"Oh... my.... goodness....

These pancakes are HUGE!!! My fiance and I shared a plate of 3, and still couldn't finish them. Might I add, they are DELICIOUS! I hope to come back to Vegas soon to have more. We also ordered eggs and such, which were great. The portions are huge, so make sure to come hungry. Prices are very reasonable, I think we paid less for our meal here than a similar meal at Ihop!

We'll be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot, great food, great value. Had a couple of smooth Manhattans and the corned beef hash. Long wait...so plan for it, but there might not be a better value in the strip area. Can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this place by a friend and we all decided to check it out as a group for brunch. 

Upon stepping into the entrance, slot machines on the left are one of your first sights, very Vegas indeed. The entire environment seemed to emit Vegas-style retroness with fake indoor palm trees, colorful sugar, and a disco-like vibe.

Since I knew the portions would be huge, my boyfriend and I decided to share a meal. We decided to order the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (that comes with hash browns). In addition, since it was the morning and it looked like every other table ordered some, my boyfriend decided to order a BLOODY MARY to go along with the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. The cocktail waitress was very nice in explaining it to him since he didn't know how it worked. You actually get to choose the type of Vodka you would like in it and they use their own secret list of spices to be included. As for it being brunch time, in Vegas, you would have to be drinking every time of the day. 

My cousin decided to order the PEPPERMILL SAMPLER (golden fried shrimp, breaded chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bruschetta and batter dipped onion rings) for all of us to share. And that was the first thing that came out and man, did we have to share. The entire thing was huge. Sadly, I was only able to try the mozzarella sticks (which were very warm and gooey inside with cheese after being dipped into marinara sauce--yummy!) and an onion ring (I've had better elsewhere). The rest I left to the others in my group to try. 

My boyfriend's BLOODY MARY came out next. Being his first time, it wasn't bad. I tasted it as well and it did taste like V8 with a little bit of Vodka with seasoning in it for better flavor. He actually finished the whole thing and was glad his first time was at Peppermill. 

Finally, our main entree came out, the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (with hashbrowns). It was super crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside and with that gravy on top made it even that much savory. The hashbrowns also had a nice top crunch to it which I love. 

Overall, we came out very stuffed. Luckily, since we shared, we were able to eat all of the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. I wouldn't have been able to if I went into this as a lone person. 

Great first time experience. I can't wait to see what else Vegas has left for me."}
{"text":"Went to a late dinner here on a Saturday night after a long day on the strip. I was pleasantly surprised about this place. Food is actually really good better than Denny's or any other 24 hour restaurants I've been to recently. Staff are friendly and the atmosphere is really fun, decorated like out of the 50s or 60s. Food portions are very generous and there's a wide variety of things to order from on the menu. This is a great alternative to going back in ordering room service at your hotel.  Price is fair compared to eating at a restaurant in one of the casinos.  Check this place out breakfast lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I always come here super late night when I'm in Vegas and i love it!! The food is SO good all of it! I have never had anything i was unhappy with. The menu is large there are so many options. I love the vibe of the place as well and the bar in the back is my favorite. The little seating areas are SO cool totally 80's and I love it! The fire pit in the water is a Nice place to sit at and snack after a long night of partying or working. Defiantly a locals spot and worth going to."}
{"text":"Very busy but they do take reservations. Food came out in a decent amount of time and was very yummy. I'm a big breakfast fan so I had breakfast for dinner.  The rest of the table had burgers and it was good reviews all around. The one cocktail my brother ordered was $14 which is very overpriced but not a reason to skip out on this place."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! Old school Vegas. I always bring my out of town friends when they visit Vegas. Funky décor, and delicious food! Awesome for those famous Vegas hangovers. LOL! Be prepared to wait for a table, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"A vegas staple. Old school feel with classic, large portions of food and good service. Great place to eat and drink on the strip. Are there more luxurious places to eat in LV? Of course, but when you wanna eat good food to soak up the alcohol you're gonna drink there are few spots at this price point that would be options. Not shy to recommend anyone to this place and no one has ever been disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a really fun, retro-themed restaurant. I remember the experience more than the food, but I do remember liking everything I ate. I especially liked the giant cocktail that my friend and I ordered to share during our breakfast. They had a photographer come around to each table to take pictures, so I thought that was a nice touch as I'm sure most customers were tourists."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the place that you need to know in Vegas, you just found it. 

The people that know where to go for good food and a fun time come here. This place has been around for a long time and for good reason.

When you step into The Peppermill it is like stepping back into time. The eclectic decor reminds you of the good old days of Vegas and if you have a good thing, you don't change it!

This place has two sides so make sure you go to the right side to get what you are looking for. The right side is the restaurant  and the left side is the (Fireside) lounge.

The Restaurant has just about anything you are looking for no matter what time of day. Don't see what you want on the menu, just ask because they may be able to make it for you. 

The Fireside Lounge is where you go to relax and enjoy reasonably priced drinks on the strip. This is where you go when you don't want the crazy crowds of the big casinos. You can also order food to enjoy the night."}
{"text":"Just the ambience alone makes this place,  comfortable seating in the lounge 70's. Love, love this place. The bloody Mary was a smooth delight. The peppermill platter ...yum. fireplace   I always wanted to come here and I was not disappointed"}
{"text":"Ate in the lounge where you can only order appetizers. All I can say is that if the abundance of an appetizer is that large that I can imagine eating a full meal. Took some friends from out of town and sat by the fireside and orders sliders- didn't care for the cole slaw, wings were wonderful and good size and small nachos. The nachos had that cheese that doesn't melt and was the only reason why I couldn't give 5 stars. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the servers were very knowledgable."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things so I'll say this, if your ever in Las Vegas this is a MUST!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome, portions are big you definitely can split a meal. I will be back"}
{"text":"This place is a must do when in Vegas. Be prepared to wait to be seated, especially if you're going for breakfast but it's soooo worth it. The atmosphere is phenomenal. The neon lights fake trees make for a worthwhile experience. I had the Sun City BLT which was amazing!! I was craving a bit of lunch and breakfast and this item hit the spot. Krystal, our server, was the best! Hope and pray you get her to serve you and if possible request to sit at one of her tables."}
{"text":"when you think of real vegas, you think of this place. i dont mean the nice upscale vegas, i mean the dark, neon light, smells like smoke, diner with slot machines vegas. and that's this place.

we went here because the guy at the wynn said this place had good burgers for cheap, and girls walking around in mini skirts.

he was 2 for 2.

the only problem with it was it was just a tad too ghetto for my taste. im not an elitist, hell im not even yelp elite, but still it was just a bit down in the dumps. although i will give it credit, the girls working there were very hot, and the milkshakes were bomb.

we thought our waitress was really cute and wanted to hit on her a bit, so we thought it would be a good idea if we asked about milkshakes. my first friend was in love with this girl and wanted to talk to her, so when she walked up it went like this.

friend 1 (who was in love with her): silence
friend 2: um so we wanted to ask you about the milkshakes
me: uh yeah what flavors do you have?
waitress: strawberry vanila and chocolate
friend 1: silence
friend 2: ok so we have a question. we want to split a milkshake, but we dont want to seem, how do we say this, um, uh, homosexual per say. so which would you think is hotter, one milkshake with 3 straws, or 3 separate glasses
waitress (laughing): whatever you want babe
me: well after that we are def. not getting the pink strawberry


it was only after that we noticed a ring on her finger (she was still young like 24). my first friend said he called an audible, but either way it was a solid swing and a miss.

so if you want a cheap meal with some hilarious surroundings, hit this place up. classy wise it is def. not up there, but it is a great place none the less."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for the 1st time after a night of drinking and Peppermill didn't disappoint.  Food was delicious with very generous portions, at least for what you pay if say. Customer service was good, and the seafood omelette I had was excellent...

Now for the interesting. A couple next to us came in soon after we did & immediately the guy began badgering his girlfriend from an argument/disagreement they had earlier n the evening. Now arguing is 1 thing but this fool made the woman cry, she ran into the bathroom, he chased her in there and the continued to argue and berate her back at the table.
So to the pretty lol blonde with the person of unknown color boyfriend with the Trump misogynist complex, I am truly sorry I didn't speak up and stop his foolishness earlier, I try and stay out of people's affairs but your crying, the berating and disrespect had become enough. He obviously seemed comfortable doing that and probably wasn't the 1st time but I hope you realize your worth and never allow it to happen from him or anyone again, but I hope my interference didn't instigate any further verbal or physical altercation once you had left the restaurant.

So yea good times and interesting hour at the Peppermill lol"}
{"text":"Seating was very fast. Parking lot was full and we watched four groups enter as we approached the door.  Hostess told us to wait 5 to 10 minutes but seated us in 2 minutes.  Service was just as fast.

Portions are very large.  We had the Fish & Chips, Pancake Special, Hot Wings (20 pieces) and Tropical Fruit Waffle.  Fish was thick and crispy.  All of us ended-up getting a take-out box.  They also gave us some coffee to go.  

Very nice wait staff and good food!"}
{"text":"First time trying the place and it definitely will not be the last. Huge portions of food. Got a half order of Nachos Nachos Nachos and it was enough to feed me and my g/f for a few days. I ordered the Gyros and my g/f ordered the philly both were good and better as leftovers. Will be coming back to check out breakfast."}
{"text":"This place has the coolest ambiance and the biggest portions I have ever seen in regards to their breakfast selections. 
Make sure to share with a friend unless you think you can handle all the breakfasty goodness they can dish up!"}
{"text":"This place is super cool. The ambience and food are  AWESOME & the kids ate everything... we all did"}
{"text":"Came her with a group of friends for a late breakfast after we checked out of our hotel.  I had always seen this place at the end of the strip, but never stopped in.  It was a Sunday morning and we had a large group, so we had to wait a while.  We sat in the Fireside lounge while we waited.  They have the best Bloody Mary's I have ever had!  They serve them in a large hurricane glass, with a huge stalk of celery.  It had the right amount of spices and alcohol.  

I honestly don't remember the food too much, it was good and the portions are huge.  It is a little pricey, don't let the location fool you, so if you lost your a$$ at the casino you might want to eat and drink somewhere else.  

I definitely make it a point to come here when I am with a group of friends though.  The Bloody Mary's alone are worth it for me."}
{"text":"Food - 1 star
Service - 3 stars 

After all the years in coming to Vegas, we had never eaten at Peppermill.  Stopped here today before our flight and had the worst (seriously the worst) Bloody Mary I've ever had, plus a very overpriced plate of corned beef hash that was lacking in flavour, texture, etc.  

There are SO many other good places to eat in Vegas... this may be iconic, but it's certainly not delicious!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since our college days of weekend trips to Vegas,  a good stop before your long road back to LA on the 15.  Came back last week for some breakfast before our flight back to San Diego...Great variety on the menu still, huge portions as usual and good fast food with good friendly service. Had the blueberry pancakes, too much to finish, hubby had eggs and turkey sausage....good job, how about smaller portions with appropriate costs next time....we had no room for doggy bags on this trip."}
{"text":"Best old-style Vegas cocktail lounge in town.  Romantic and yes, a bit cheesey, but sexy too.  Faux trees at every turn and little twinkling lights (or maybe that was just the effect of the cocktails) and comfy sofa's to plop down on and enjoy your drinks. They also serve a selection of appetizers in the lounge, so it is one of the few places left in town where one can enjoy decent cocktails, good appetizers and a smoke all at the same time.  The food served in the front of the house is always excellent (for a coffee shop) and generous portions.  I have always found the service to be friendly and prompt, although sometimes slow in the lounge.  

Everyone should visit this place before they die!!!"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow. Food was awesome. I have been coming here since the early 90s. I love the vibe and old Vegas feel. I remember when getting a job doing cocktails here was like hitting the lottery. Everyone working there now is Like 22 and has no idea of what Vegas really is. When I asked any questions I got the head tilt. I did tell them many times we were there for my sons birthday. No one even acknowledged it. Of all the places he could have gone..he wanted to go there. Overall it seemed like a great generic place to eat."}
{"text":"Passed by this place many times but never bothered to stop by.. Until, we did a \"nearby\" search on my Yelp App... Mann, have I been missin' out for the last few years!! 

First off, the atmosphere/decor is definitely out of the ordinary and most likely inspired from a nightclub/strip club.. Disco ball glass, Cherry Blossom Trees and Neon Lights.. Interesting and totally Vegas!

What will make me come back again and again:

Southern Fried Steak: This was the Best Chicken Fried Steak I've ever had! Crispy, Crispy Chicken Breading, Good Thickness, Tender and So Flavorful!! The gravy was Great and just made it even better! It came with Some of the Best Hash Browns I've ever had!! Yes, this plate was a Double Whammy!! The Hash had the typical string/shredded potatoes but wider cuts and an amplified potato flavor!! The eggs, I tried their scrambled eggs and they were tastier than average and fluffier than normal. Plus, I opted with a side of White Toast. The Toast was ordinary but it came with a delicious strawberry jam. To Top it off, this entree could easily feed two starving people!!! 

French Toast: Another Generous Dish that came with 6 Fat 1/2Slices of Texas Toast that were Frenched up Correctly! Nice soft butter and maple syrup (not too thick) just brought it home! Traditional and Executed Right! 

Marinated Pork Chops: Came with 2 bone-in cuts, grilled with the nice evident checker marks and lightly seasoned with herbs and spices. Not bad but Nothing compared to the Southern/Chicken Fried Steak. This also came with a small slices of apples and sauce. The side of Hash Browns.. You know how I feel about those! This time, I went with egg whites and a bagel with cream cheese for the included choice of sides. Egg whites were Great (similar to the scrambled eggs) and the Bagel was massive and Satisfying (No, Einstein Bagel but it did the job).

Dined here twice now, within a week and this place isn't around the block.. Hint, Hint.. Service both times were Flawless.. Veteran Servers: know what to say, how to say it and when to say it.. Fast service, follow-ups.. I like the Feel and Atmosphere, much different the norm. Prices are alright, they pile on the food and quality is there. I'm hooked on their Southern Fried Steak and Eggs!!! and  Hash Browns!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Peppermill a few times, both the lounge and the diner sides. This last time was just bad. Initially we wanted to sit in the Lounge by the fire pit, but after 15 minutes of sitting at a dirty table and getting no service we had to get up and ask someone for menus. When we received the menus we decided to go to the diner side as there couldn't have been more than 10 choices that you are able to order in the lounge side. Okay, fine. We get to the diner side, the guy who seats us is a complete...I had to ask him to seat us! We table hopped to finally find one that wasn't a) by a bunch of loud obnoxious drunk kids or b) underneath a full blast AC going in October. After finding a table getting a waiter was our next struggle. A man walked by and asked if we had ordered, we said no and he just walked off. We were pretty confused as I thought no was a pretty universal word. When we finally got him to come back we waited quite a while for the less than mediocre food we were served (again, I ordered a burger). I get that this is a cool place to go if you're absolutely trashed and hungry in Vegas late at night, but NEVER EVER go here sober. Trust me, the food and the irritation isn't worth it. Ugh."}
{"text":"A must to do for visitors very retro and original Vegas. The fireside bar is beautiful and very cozy. They come around each booth and take a free complementary Photo of everyone at the table. My favorite thing to order here is the fruit platter it has to be the entire fridge of fruit on a Fred Flintstone size platter. I have yet to have a bad meal and some of my favorites also are huge pancake breakfast and their soups"}
{"text":"We went to this location because it was right by our hotel and the front desk recommended it.  The food was good, although they were busy so it took a little while to get to us.  I had the pesto chicken sandwich which needed more pesto to be honest.  It was kind of dry.  My friend had the caprese style ciabatta and said it was really yummy.  I don't remember the name of the drink I ordered but it had champagne and was looked really nice but was sooooooo expensive!  Overall I would go again, their breakfast looked amazing."}
{"text":"Ok first off I have been waiting almost 10 years to get the chance to come try this ultra cool classic dinner/lounge of Las Vegas. When I finally did I think the hype was just way too high. 

The Peppermill is a dinner slash lounge and when I first moved here in my hey days friends and family always suggested The Peppermill as a late night hang out or a cool place to grab food and more drinks after a long night out. They might have been a bit on the drunk side every time they were there though lol. Anyhow fast forward about 10 years later a wife and 2 kids later life was totally different and friends too now have families of their own.

After numerous try's to eat here for breakfast with families from out of town has been unsuccessful I finally got that break. A friend and his wife and kid was visiting and after a night of taking our kids to the Nostalgic Circus Circus we ran out of options places to eat and then  I remember THE PEPPERMILL so there we headed. We get there and the parking lot was quit bare and I am celebrating at this point. 

Walking in we were all excited for this experience and couldn't wait to see what was in store. Like another fellow Yelper said inside of the Peppermill totally gives off a Strip club vibe which was a bit funny because we had our 1 to 3 year olds with us. Note that even though it is a lounge on one side it is a totally kid friendly place with a kids menu at that. We were seat fairly quickly and food came out at a reasonable time. Though it was not that busy. Service was friendly and food came out in big portions. All the food options on the menu sounded super good and they came out pretty good but nothing over-the-top. It is a diner and I'm sure if I was out all night drinking and partying the food portion and flavor would be on point, but I wasn't so I am a little bit more critical. The food sizes were amazing and I can completely appreciate that but the taste was only a couple steps up from your typical Dennys. 

Never the less we had a good time Anderson enjoyed our food. I will totally be back but if there is a wait what so ever I won't be waiting in that line. Next time I'm leave the kids at home and joining the other adults in the lounge so I can finally have my drunken late night experience I never got to have. Stay tune for that review update LOL!"}
{"text":"I immediately fell in love with this spot because I'm a huge fan o the movie Swingers. This dinner is featured in the movie.

The food is great. Nothing like some late night comfort food after hitting the strip hard. I love walking in here while wearing any vintage attire. It completes the Vintage Vegas experience especially during Viva Las Vegas weekend or after hitting downtown (old Las Vegas) or anytime for that matter.

Your Vegas experience is not complete until you hit this place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Tried the Happy Hour Chicken Quesadilla and it wasn't that impressive. Green peppers were located inside the tortilla, along with way too much chicken that wasn't that tasty at all. The salsa also had no flavor. Not too bad on drink prices as it was about $5 for a can of Guiness and $7 for a Mixed Drink. Since this place is a Vegas icon, it is worth stopping in to check out the firepits and some of their \"girly\" drinks are pretty famous as well. Entrees are expensive and you can only get appetizers at the bar area. The deserts are not homemade, but the carrot cake was a decent rendition. Worth the trip to see what life was like back in the Vegas glory days (AKA before the Ferris Wheels started arriving in town)."}
{"text":"Seriously epic!  I love the atmosphere here.  It's neon, but quiet and the other lights are low, so even in the heat of the day, you feel calmer just being inside the Peppermill.  I also love the colored sugar.  Call me crazy, but it's fun.  

The food is great here. I can count the number of BLT's I've liked in my life on one hand and the BLTA (avocado) at the Peppermil is one of them.  I get mine on rye, because rye is the best.  Fruit cups.  How many of us sigh at the fruit cup option?  They always suck, right?  Not here! The Peppermill fruit comes in a good sized bowl and includes strawberries, banana blueberries, grapes, and melon.  Yum!  Love the cottage cheese, love the chicken strips, love the Reuben.  

If you don't like any of these things, don't worry, the menu has a lot of options.  I'll bet you find something you like too."}
{"text":"This place has a diner side with 24 hour service and then the Fireside Lounge where you can chill out and have some drinks. Ck out the pics for this place, there's a pic or two of the fire/water thingie - it's really way cool. The place is major tacky but in a fun and cozy way. In the diner there are huge artificial cherry blossom trees all over the place. The decor is like nothing I ever saw before. The food is excellent, too. At least what we had was good. We had breakfast. My husband got the pancakes and they were three enormous cakes that even he couldn't finish. (He ate the three pound Big Daddy Luke burger - but that's another review!) I had the french toast collage and it was yummy, too. The Collage is bacon, eggs, and french toast. 

We took a cab here. I don't think it is the best neighborhood to go wandering around. It is near the Sahara and Riviera. We almost went two times cause it was so good and fun."}
{"text":"While in a Uber, my driver ranted and raved about this place. I was quite disappointed unfortunately. I order the French toast and the food wasn't bad, but wasn't great. The syrup had no flavor at all. Had hash browns, they were ok. My friend got steak and eggs, and they over cooked the steak. The wait to get a table was an hour which was disappointing because of how the food was. The service was mediocre. Overall, was not impressed and would never go again"}
{"text":"Forget Bouchon or Sinatra.. the first place we wanted to revisit to on our second trip to Vegas was the Peppermill.

It's not how surprisingly great the food is, the totally vintage and tacky decor, or the fact that it's open 24 hours. 

It's that awesome fireside lounge. If it's not busy you can get a seat right infront of the fire. If not, it's not so bad either, you can curl up on the couches and watch random music videos while nursing a bloody mary all night.

In the restaurant, the girls are dressed like Hooters girls, in the lounge they're dressed like prom queens in full on gowns. With that said, the lounge is NOT fancy, it's just a cool place to drink and be comfortable.

Again, still love the Peppermill and I'll probably come back here every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for breakfast no matter if it's 2 am, 4 am, or 10 am. I always go to Peppermill when I'm in Vegas and it never disappoints nor have I ever had to wait too long. The service is well organized; they keep things moving. I always order the seafood omelette top with hollandaise sauce. 

This is a popular place. It's never not busy."}
{"text":"it's magic romantic place. we're sitting around fireplace.that was wonderful.trees around tables.AND absolutely delicious food.bid and tasty portions.and they serve early breakfast.so you can eat testy after party:)))and good price.so I'd recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"This was a great place all the way around. Neon lights inside and out..the food was huge portions amd really good.everything we had was delicious...the atmosphere was fun too..they have colored sugar on your table for coffee etc.pretty cool"}
{"text":"You cannot leave Vegas without eating here. Amazing food, huge portions, and I suggest hanging out in the lounge by the fire. Such a great amount of character with the setting, and if you try to be a smart ass with the waitresses they'll give you a run for your money. Love this place."}
{"text":"Not my type a restaurant. Overpriced and not that tasty. Should've went to Denny's. sorry to be so harsh it's just my honest opinion"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm, greasy American food!! We called ahead and made reservations, which was a little scattered. The person who answered the phone said they weren't accepting reservations, then she passed us off to someone who promptly asked for our name and number in our party. Glad we got on the list, because they were citing a 45-minute wait to walk-ins when we arrived!

The place was packed, and the vibe was loud but weirdly intimate in our booth. Perfect for a family trying to squeeze in a late dinner: our three boys under 5 years old were starting to meltdown a bit, but nobody noticed in this environment. Totally welcoming for groups of all sizes. Love that the servers didn't give us strange looks for coming in with a stroller. The prices were reasonable and the portions were big. I'd definitely come back with anyone, anytime."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time in April.  We went to the fireside lounge and I immediately fell in love with the decor and ambiance of the fireside lounge.   Then I ordered food, and now, this place is a must visit whenever I go to Vegas.  So, when I was trying to find a place to hold my wedding reception, EVERYWHERE we thought of wanted a $5,000 minimum.  I had to keep it cheap.  I thought of Peppermill, but thought the place is too nice, it'll be just as pricey as the rest, if not pricier.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong!!!!  They had a catering menu that topped ALL the other menus I had seen so far, they had steak, chicken, pasta, and salmon all on their $28/ plate catering menu.  They asked for no minimum and no pre-ordering.  So I didn't have to spend time asking people ahead of time if they want chicken or steak which was awesome, because planning even the smallest wedding on your own is hard!  I was in touch with a woman named Peggy Orth the entire time, and she made everything even EASIER!  She was pleasant to deal with, prompt in returning emails, and made a few excellent suggestions.  This is all leading up to my big day.   So the day comes.  They had to wait for people to clear out to make room for my 80+ guests.  All of us went to wait in the fireside lounge, and EVERYBODY loved the lounge as much as I did.  Our tables were all ready in about 10 minutes.  Our food was delicious, and it came quick, especially for not having pre-ordered.  The staff made sure my husband and I had our own \"wedding\" table and made us feel like royalty.  Peggy did an excellent job, i would loved to have met her, but she wasn't working that day.  And that goes to show what a great manager she must be, because she's obviously very organized a good at what she does to set up a party of 80 people and have it go off without a hitch when she's not even there.
Peppermill is on my official list of All-time favorite places in the world!!!  Everyone from the wedding still talks about how awesome a choice the Peppermill was!!!"}
{"text":"Can you say 70's disco?    Neon reigns at the Peppermill!

We came here for breakfast on Sunday morning and just beat the rush at about 9am.     The food was really tasty and portions were huge!     I had a scramble that included lingusa sausage with peppers and onions mixed with hash browns (don't recall the name...it was Munch something...).    Really, really good but so big I think I ate about half of it.    My husband had the San Francisco breakfast which was equally good and equally huge.    

Beware the photographer offering you a free postcard - she'll be back trying to sell you a $15 picture to go with your free postcard."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Peppermill in a few years, but that place was awesome.  It looks like a Denny's or something else crappy on the outside.  When you get inside there's a weird restaurant thing, but if you walk to the left past that there's an awesome cheezy bar complete with firepit with flames coming out of water, red couches and blue carpeting (at least when I was there).  I also remember fake foliage and Christmas lights."}
{"text":"What can I say.....large portions and melt in your mouth good. This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend and the food was phenomenal. If you are in Las Vegas, please take the time to visit Peppermill, it is worth every bit of the wait."}
{"text":"Not fantastic, not horrible.

First of all, man! This place gets crowded. If you can, head straight for the counter for immediate seating. Otherwise, you may be doomed to a 20-30 minute wait, if not more (depending on what time of day/night you're trying to get your grub on.)

Menu is nothing spectacular and is pretty standard. The Peppermill is really known for atmosphere and portion size. And the portions are pretty big. Hell, the cup of coffee was a thing of beauty for a coffee drinker like me.

I opted for the eggs Benedict. My waitress uttered \"good choice\" when I ordered, so I expected something fabulous. What I got was .. eggs Benedict. Hey, poached eggs aren't exactly easy to get perfect, so I give them credit for perfectly cooked eggs with just the right amount of runny yolk. Other than that .. pretty standard. You do get 3 eggs instead of the usual 2, and a large portion of hash brown potatoes. Add your own salt and pepper and/or Tabasco, because the hollandaise sauce is pretty flavorless.

Oh, if you sit at the counter, watch your neighbors. The idiot that plopped down on the stool next to me decided he needed cream for his coffee and .. without a word to me .. reached across my plate to take cream out of the supply my waitress left for me. Didn't even apologize after he did it and realized that it wasn't \"for everyone\". D.B."}
{"text":"We love the peppermill!!! Quick service,great food,large portions and we love the amazing staff!! We were greeted by LARZ the host- whom which we believe should be promoted to manager and tells us \"there appetizers are gangster\". We had a shy but willing to take one for the team server Yancyyyy! Who we convinced to pose in our complimentary group photo! We love Mary the manager- she coo too! Maryyyyy we will see you tonight!!! Go to the peppermill and get your experience!"}
{"text":"First of all the host Kim was so rude from the very beginning, it pretty much set the tone for the whole experience. After 30+ minutes of waiting to be seated we get seated only to catch Kim and a bus boy named Jeffry roll their eyes at us. Elisha was our server, who was pretty nice and quick. Food is decent but the service is absolutely HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Wow! I wish I could give 10 stars!  Don't let the outside fool you.  It looks like a Spires type restaurant outside. Nothing special.  But inside is amazing! The decor is old school 70's disco style but very nice.  Check out the lounge too. Coolest ambiance ever! Fire & water pit to relax around. 

Now to get to the service. OMG! Can't get better. Period.  Went for breakfast but they serve their whole menu all day. Greeted right away by friendly host. Sat and served coffee immediately.  Cocktail waitress frequented a couple times to make sure we didn't want anything. Friendly not pushy. Waitress was friendly and very attentive. Filled drinks right away.  Noticed without asking that we were out of regular sugar packs. My eggs were waaay over runny and I had to send them back.  She was very apologetic.  The manager brought my eggs back perfect and also apologized.  She said she personally sent them back twice for me because they cooks didn't get them right to get liking. Wow. Judy wow. That is personal attention.
Speaking of food,  our was great.  My meal was super simple (eggs, sausage & hash browns). Was good.  Hash browns are ribbon style and fresh. But my hubby ordered chicken fried steak. It was really, really good! Huge and cooked perfectly.  Not chewy. Yummy gravy that tasted like sausage. The portions are enormous!  Easily shareable. 3 eggs come with most dishes.
Can't wait to come again! They have an awesome team!"}
{"text":"Okay. So five-stars *may* be a little inflated, but they closed the last peppermill in the Bay Area about 6 or 7 years ago, and I miss it. My favorite thing is the fruit salad. Which is enough fruit and fiber for 4. It comes with homemade banana bread - um, yum - and marshmallow dipping sauce, AND rainbow sherbet. Hello?! Dessert! :) The colorful sugar is deemed magical."}
{"text":"Go to the peppermill next time you are in Vegas. To quote one of my friends \"the whole place looks like the inside of a limo \" it's a neon jungle on crack...pinks and purples and teals...flamingo decor...weird shaped booths.
The food in the restaurant part is pretty good. I had a burger( i think it was on parmesan toast) The waitresses wear full blown tacky cocktail gown's. The bar/lounge with the fire pit !!!! pure cheeky heaven. for the restless they had some video poker all up in there too !

this place is a must see !"}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying not once were we asked how our food was or how we were doing. My lemonade tasted like dirty dish water, the waitress never brought us anymore coffee after we asked and for okay food it was not worth the price at all. I can handle okay food if the service was good, but it was terrible. I am huge on customer service and yes I understand it was busy, but I am a server as well and whether I'm slammed with tables or just having a shit night, I still make sure to check on my customers and this dud did nothing. We came here thinking it would be good because it's always busy and the menu had classics on it. I ordered the ciabatta pesto burger and it was slop. No flavor and a mess and fell apart with a soggy bun. Nope. I won't return."}
{"text":"After doing my research and planning out our vacation Peppermill was on our list. We were excited to try the restaurant whom stood the rest of time with the assumption the food was excellent. We were severely disappointed with the food, service and drinks. The Mai Tai tasted like rotten juice. The steak salad was mediocre at best. The brotato appetizer was so bland if I put anymore salt and pepper on it I was certainly headed to the ER. They were willing to replace the brotatoes buy served me a dish equally disgusting. Canned refried beans with what a assume was cheese whiz on top. SMH!! Then refused to take it off the bill stating they were not \"Texas Style Nachos\" (we are from Austin). Horrible Experience. The only positive was a homeless man ate FOOD, not tasty Food but it's a meal. Don't waste your time or money.. Super disappointed at the quality of food and lack of customer service with management!!!!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to go here because it was me and my newly fiances celebration engagement date. We paid $20 to get there, because we take uber, and paid $30 for food, mind you we only got a philly and fruit. With that being said we are not in the best shape with money so having spent $50 for the worst service, was not okay. We rarely go on dates so it was really frustrating that all this happened. But even then we still paid for our meal. We get there and after waiting 15 minutes for our server to even acknowledge us, when she did all she said was \"are you guys ready to order\". I am a server and am very easy to please, because I am a server I am way more lenient about things then others. But this experience was unacceptable. After the long wait when we finally got our food *which was good* we asked for ranch and when we did she said \" I know I'm getting it \" in a very rude way and also never smiled. Then it took her about 8 minutes to get a little side of ranch. By then my boyfriend had maybe 2 bites left. The table in front of us had asked for a lemonade 5x in total and didn't even get that. They not only had to ask the busser who blew them off and continued setting up silverware but also another server who still didn't bring the lemonade by then they were extremely upset and left. so we definitely were not the only unhappy people. Very disappointed because I was so excited for this date. Will not be returning unless things change."}
{"text":"Very Excellent service and food!! Bring an appetite cause the portion sizes are big as hell!! The 1970's motif really adds to the Vegas ambiance!!"}
{"text":"Another \"milestone\" review for me... #500 on Yelp!  I had to devote a place I actually LIKE for #500!!!
I'm a sucker for reality tv, reading books by celebrities, etc.  Holly Madison mentioned that this was one of her favorite places, and I think one of her reality show episodes had her peeps dining here.  This is also a favorite of the locals, so I visited this place for breakfast with friends a few years ago...the portions were HUGE, and we actually remembered this as being a \"favorite\" of ours.  Las Vegas has numerous restaurants to choose from so if you remember a good one...you'll want to return rather than taking a risk elsewhere.

I was back there this past weekend, and I asked my friend where she wanted to go for dinner...she didn't care.  Since we had a car this time I suggested Ellis Island, or Peppermill.  She's not much of a beer drinker, so I thought she'd like the ambiance in this place better so we stopped in again.  There is lots of parking in the lot here.  This place has a 70's roller disco kind of vibe to it... it's cute, totally not cheezy!  VERY \"Vegas\" I might add.  Of all my facebook check ins while I was out there...this place had the most \"love that place\" comments from my peeps back home.  

Portions are HUGE here...you will not leave hungry.  The staff are great too.  This time we just got a few appetizers and drinks (we both ordered the \"bubble bath\").  There is a lot of mention of the nachos so we got those and barely made a dent in them, we got them with chicken too.  We also got the sliders which were very tasty.  I will absolutely keep coming back to this place when visiting Vegas, and you should too!"}
{"text":"I had one of the best meals of my life at the Peppermill Restaurant.

I was staying with a friend at the Riviera during RollerCon 2011, and after a day chock full of roller derby, we were exhausted and starving. We headed over to this restaurant that was close to our hotel, and after a short wait we were seated in this kitschy wonderland. There were so many things on the menu that sounded delicious that it took me awhile to decide what to order. I ended up choosing the french toast ambrosia, and it....was....AMAZING. When I read \"topped with seasonal fruit\", I thought there would be a few strawberries or something on top of my french toast. No, it was a platter full of french toast absolutely slathered in whipped cream, blueberries, blackberries, bananas, grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, and honeydew. It doesn't get any better than that, folks.

Our server was very nice and tolerated my friend (who always insists on modifying her menu items). We left a really generous tip. 

Considering most of the food in Vegas is expensive and crappy, this place is a MUST. I would definitely go here again the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly amazing food. Scramble was awesome and one of the best blueberry muffins I've had!! Served hot for a nice touch. And lastly, spectacular service!"}
{"text":"Great service and awesome interior. The food is classic American diner style and you don't really need sides. You do, however, need a doggy back"}
{"text":"Sorry just was not that impressed. Very $$. Booths were squeezy for all of us and the food was blah. Burger sucked according to one of my friends. The place looks nice and I like the trees inside but wont be going back."}
{"text":"We love this place! Every time we come to Vegas we grab some drinks at the fireside lounge and eat at the peppermill. We are never disappointed! Great every time!"}
{"text":"The portions are huge!! 

My friends ordered the fruit platter and it was essentially 3 pounds of tropical oasis. Not exaggerating on the portions. We had two boxes of leftovers. OF FRUIT. 

Anyways, I had the mad Greek burger on their \"summer specials\" menu, in February. ? Itwas tasty, well cooked, and came in a timely manner. 

The menu was priced well and the atmosphere was throwback but in the best way possible. If you're on the strip and want a solid bite without spending a million bucks, this is it. No wonder it's been open so long!"}
{"text":"Bulgar host talking in Spanish and calling each other names and saying stuff about the people that come eat here. Those two young Hispanic girls should know we talk and understand Spanish and by the way they talked was not professional. Overall the food was great."}
{"text":"What can I say? I have NEVER had a bad meal here. I have NEVER experienced bad service here. There is always interesting people to watch. And equally entertaining stories to overhear. Since we're locals we visit Peppermill a few times a month and we always feel comfy & at home, not surrounded by tourists like at other strip restaurants. Everything is good here...the ranch dressing is the very best ever. The corn beef hash & eggs is probably my favorite thing to order and the hot fudge sundae & banana split never disappoints. This place is perfection and we usually choose it over pretty much anything. The menu can satisfy anyone no matter what you're in the mood for. And the food is better than any plush hotel cafe out there...you just can't get better than Peppermill. Any time of day or night it's just...perfect."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is one of those breakfast places that's an institution, especially in Vegas. I wouldn't call it \"brunch\" per se, since it's much more of a breakfast joint. Lots of old school Vegas charm (i.e. Neon and mirrors).

The portions are HUGE. I had a standard waffle and my husband and Mom split a burger. You'll likely wait a while not only to be seated but also for you food. Grab a mimosa, enjoy the scenery, and be a tourist!"}
{"text":"I didn't know about The Peppermill until my good friend Christine turned me on to its charms. Now I take all my out-of-town friends and family here. 

As others have said, the food is good, no matter what you order, and the portions are huge! The fruit plate, for instance, is large enough for 2 or more people. I love the ambiance of the neon lighting, the fake cherry trees, and the friendly staff. It's just so Vegas!  The cocktail waitresses wear these long, flowing black dresses and come into the restaurant from the lounge to take your drink orders. If you want to really get crazy with the drinks, order a Scorpion...it comes in a huge bowl with straws and is meant to be shared! You gotta see it to believe it! I shared one with my nephew and his wife and it was amazing. 

The Fireside Lounge is a trip all by itself. It looks to me like something out of the 1970's: shag carpeting, and a main sunken seating area around a flaming fountain. There are video screens everywhere showing music videos.  I have come here numerous times on dates, with friends, after photo shoots, etc. Just kicked back and had a drink (or two or three) and ordered appetizers. Again, love those friendly, attentive cocktail waitresses dressed in classy black! 

So if you want to have a good meal, or just a drink, stop by one of the best-kept local secrets in town...The Peppermill!"}
{"text":"Put this on the very top of the \"Don't Know WTF I Was Thinking\" List. Way back in the day, during my first trips to Vegas, back when I was really young and didn't know any better, I thought The Peppermill was one of the coolest places everrrrrr! Some guy took me here and I remember being so impressed. He had arranged for us to sit at one of those nice romantic, sunken-in fireplace areas and was acting like he had to pull some major strings to get us sat there but was able to pull it off because he was some big shot Vegas local, yada yada yada... I can almost hear my old self saying, \"Oh my gosh, you mean they have actual fireplaces in there and we can sit next to them? WOW!!!!!\" I seriously must have been easily amused and/or completely wasted because this place is proof that some things are better left in the past as memories...

I can't believe I was in such awe of The Peppermill back in the day. *SMDH* Boy times have changed! I walked in after having talked about how cool I remembered this place being and I was instantly embarrassed. My friend gave me that, \"Really Bobbi? This is THE Peppermill?\" puzzled look. Sadly, it was nowhere near as cool as I had remembered it being. The design is completely old school and tacky as all get out by today's standards. There are mirrors everywhere (I think even on the ceilings... bowmp chicka wow wow) and tons of neon. It reminded me of a scene out of the video game Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards. Nate M. said it best, \"Is it a strip club or a Denny's on psychedelics?\" I could not stop giggling about the cheesy decor and for that I give this place three stars, for the entertainment value alone. I had a blast laughing at my past self while reading other's perceptions of this place. 

This is your basic diner/greasy spoon restaurant that is open 24/7. Yes, The Peppermill is pretty famous but the food is nothing to write home about. If you're looking to feel like you've time warped into a scene from Austin Powers or people watch, this is the place. They serve those big touristy fishbowl style drinks that you can share with multiple straws. Service was good. 

Dress like Larry from Three's Company and take someone on a date here and with a straight face, spritz some breath spray into your mouth, lean over and tell them this is your favorite restaurant, I dare you. LOLZ!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is fun.  Gawdy in a good way. Very Vegas.  The food portions are humongous.  We went for breakfast before we hit the road to go back home.  I ordered pancakes.  The waitress advised a short stack because she said they're kind of big.  She wasn't kidding.  The 2 pancakes overflowed the big plate!  That said- the actual quality of the food was left something to be desired.  The huge pancakes tasted a little cardboardy.  In addition the service wasn't so friendly- maybe it was too early in the moring.   Maybe we'll give it a second chance when we go back to vegas.  The people who went late night or for dinner in the fireside lounge seemed to have a better experience.  But with so many options in Vegas, not sure it's worth it to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"As a lover of the old timey time, I was a little shocked to have never heard of this little Vegas gem before! I got an invite from one of my gal pals who had come down for the Viva Las Vegas convention in Vegas. We loaded up a couple of cars and headed out to have dinner at a fancy restaurant that was seen in a couple of epic movies. I honestly was expecting an old formerly fashionable diner. 

We are driving by and I am aaamazed by the fancy classic neon lights outside. We step in and I am speechless...I talk a lot so it's kinda hard for this to happen to me. 
 
This restaurant contains all of the old classic Vegas glamour that you'd expect in the movies. It was like I had stepped into a scene of a classic movie. We put our names in for a table and we go into the bar to get drinks while our table gets set up. I was expecting, a bar with a couple of stools. To my amazement...we walked into neon dreams and magic mirrors! To top it off, there was a section in the bar with a mini pool that was on FIRE!

The servers and staff were all super friendly and amazing. We managed to order one round of drinks before our table was ready. 

We get seated on a giant table and the giant menu makes it super hard to pick a meal. I went for a chicken sandwich with fries. My heart really wanted some shortcake with ice cream. It was late and I needed to eat food and dessert wasn't going to cut it. 

Our food starts coming out and the portions are huuuuge! My fries were so super tasty, it's like they had some kind of magical breading on them. The chicken in my sandwich was perfectly cooked. I was able to eat half of my food and I got the rest to-go.

I was really hoping that we'd be able to come back for dinner on another day. Peppermill. we will see each other another day!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my visit here! However, my rating is more for the ambiance and experience rather than the food

This is old school Vegas with all it's gaudy lights and style. The fireside pit was definitely a place I feel I can get Day Drunk at. The fireside pit was separated from the main restaurant. If you installed a few poles and threw in some strippers, it will look EXACTLY like a strip club. It's dark and the seats were definitely strip club-esque. 

Anyhow, we ordered this fishbowl drink (supposedly their signature drink) that we saw being served at another table while waiting for our table at the fireside pit. It was about 18 dollars and enough for 2 people to share because it was huge. It was also quite a tasty drink. Thumbs up.

We also split an omelet, which came with a side of hash browns. Both were decent. Nothing particularly good or bad to say here. 

The reason I'm such a fan is the fact that it's open 24 hours, the old school Vegas feel, and a photographer even came by to take our picture and print out a free postcard for us!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the ambiance and the aesthetic here, but the food leaves much to be desired. Everything I've ever ordered here has been extremely bla?e. The appetizers are better than the entrees, however. The trashy specialty cocktails are humorous and I usually order one just to get in the Las Vegas spirit (I had the Bacardi O Dreamsicle last time). I recommend coming here for drinks and appetizers - the infamous fireside lounge is the coolest part of the building, if you can get a spot in there. It reminds me of something out of Fourside from the tripped-out Super Nintendo game Earthbound. You have to come here at least once as, from what I know, it is THE quintessential Las Vegas trash-diner... And it's open 24 hours! I hear there's quite the crowd at 4 AM ;)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  After a long afternoon of walking-we stopped for a couple of beers and some appetizers.  A great ambience in the Fireside Club.  This is about a 75 year old place but well maintained and managed.  Next door to the Riviera--but he Riviera is sold and will be imploded to make way for Convention Center-- that will happen on a couple months.  A great place to relax and oh yes the appetizers were great.  Go there!!"}
{"text":"They did a great job servicing our large party (30 plus people).  Food and service were respectable and the ambiance was interesting."}
{"text":"I waiver between 4 and 5 stars on this. I'm at about a 3.5 to 4 for the Peppermill Restaurant and a solid 5 for the Fireside Lounge.

Let's start with the Fireside Lounge. This is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I've loved it since I first visited Vegas years and years ago. It's one of the first places that springs to mind when I think of \"old Vegas\". This little tucked away lounge is both classy and neon. It's both laid-back and fun. I can just picture any classic Vegas star sitting on a couch here.

The Fireside Lounge is pretty small. When you walk into the Peppermill, you'll see a small glass door off to your left labeled \"Fireside Lounge\". When you walk through it, you'll see lots of blues, pinks, and greens, bits of neon, mirrors, and plenty of fake plants and trees. But it so works, it feels classy - old Vegas classy.

To your right is a small, low bar with some video poker. To your left is a large indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing. Around the indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing is a huge circle couch. Around the rest of the room are smaller couches and some chairs - in an array of different sizes to accommodate just your size group. And the way it is all laid out, it is not too hard to find a private corner for some snuggling.

On corners around the room are TVs playing all sorts of music videos. Sometimes it 80s hair bands, sometimes it's a live Pearl Jam show. It's different just about every time I go. And it's never too loud. It's just there in the background, providing ambiance and conversation starters.

The best part is that the cocktail waitresses wear long, black evening gowns. It just adds to the whole environment and experience. There's a decent cocktail list and bar snack menu. Don't expect anything inventive here (though, they have been trying some new martinis). It's all classic and old-fashioned (and that is what is going to taste the best here). Think Mai Tai and shrimp cocktail.

Combine all that with it being open-24 hours and you've got a must-do. It can be a romantic spot for couples and a chill spot for a group of guys or gals. And I've seen a few celebrities here too. Not the type that host at Pure, but the type that you might catch performing at The Joint.

And I have to add that the staff at the Fireside are pretty open and willing to accommodate. My husband decided to surprise me with an Elvis impersonator for my birthday, and he set it all up with Fireside for this Elvis to come in and sing to me. So yeah, Fireside is totally a 5 star place.

So on to the Peppermill Restaurant. Sure, there are better 24 hour restaurants in Vegas, but almost none with this kind of atmosphere. And the food is well above average. I can't say I've eaten here a lot, but the handful of times I have, I haven't had any complaints. 

The portions are huge - so don't be afraid to share. My favorite menu items are actually the omelettes. They're huge and flavorful (no going stingy on the cheese and fillers here), and they just really hit the spot after a long night of drinking and gaming. 3.5 stars for the food, but add 1/2 a star for the ambiance.

The Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge are novelty Vegas places not to be missed."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant, it just has this great vibe, service and food.  So, my friend has never been here, so we decide to take a morning walk from the middle of The Strip to here (great walk). We were promptly greeted and sat, then offered drinks all in a non-rushed and very friendly manner. My friend ordered the waffles with bacon, sausage and eggs  and I got the biscuits and gravy. Both great dishes for breakfast. As soon as our food arrived, my friend fell in love with my meal. Bite from hers, a bite from mine. Our server was very attentive, not overbearing, always the perfect time to check on us. There was a moment when I excused myself to  leave the table and upon my return, noticed she devoured most of my meal!! we laughed and I ate part of hers. The meal was so good she was making plans to come back again tomorrow. Peppermill you just made another loyal fan."}
{"text":"Food was good, when they got the order right. The staff was rude & slow. The night manager was extremely rude  & her staff probably learned how to be rude from her. One of my friends who came here all the time ordered the same thing she always does & they tried to over charge her for her meal. 
They are also not handicap friendly, their tables are to close together & not easy to maneuver through. When we talked to the manager she had NO problem being aggressive & has NO clue how to talk to a customer or how to give good service. One of our party couldn't even get a refill on her coffee, she got up and had to get it herself. The manager then tried to make us feel bad when she came back & told us that she talked to our waitress & that she was in the back crying. That only says she has no people skills."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat after partying. The portions are huge and you can't really go wrong with anything you order! Breakfast for dinner. I think so! The only bad thing was that their system was down so everything had to be done manually and the girls didn't know how. Besides that, the experience was great!"}
{"text":"Every since I was a child I have come here.  It's a must when visiting.  Bar is nicely renovated too!"}
{"text":"I had heard so much about the peppermill restaurant.  supposedly it's a must see.  It has a gaudy and retro look to it.  Neon lights are everywhere.  They are open 24-7 and offer a full menu (breakfast and dinner).  There's also a separate lounge area with a fireplace. it is equally as retro and gaudy as the restaurant.  The food portions are huge. chances are you will have left overs.  overall, I thought it was okay.  It is basically a glorified diner.  I wasn't impressed by the food or the drinks, but I can see why it's a Vegas tradition.  it was fun to visit once.  Personally, I would not go out of my way to come here again.  Service was good and servers were friendly."}
{"text":"So I didn't see the fire pit but the velvet booths everywhere was interesting and the trees inside made for a nice view. Now the food was fantastic. Steak, eggs, hash browns with cheese and tomatoes with a cranberry muffin. Didn't finish it and took it back to my room. The uniforms were pretty cool. The ladies working the bar area had full length dresses on, the waitresses had these cute blue and white uniforms. The service was timely and efficient and cheerful. Will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Aaaahhh the Peppermill, our favorite place for cheap eats in Vegas.

    We have been here dozens of times and still look forward to going every time we are in town. I have ordered most everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. And the portions are huge so thats a bonus right there. They have fantastic wings and there not way the hell over priced like at the Bellagio cafe. 
    I love the decor as well, The neon is great, and the tree running all over the place is nice also. My only complaint, the damn booths are for tinny people! Im not a small guy and I have a hell of a time fitting into any of the booths. This is the country with the fat people remember? I think a remodel is in order here. 
     If you still have not checked out the Peppermill I strongly recommend it. The food and the atmosphere are fantastic. The prices are great as well."}
{"text":"Walkable distance from the Rivera hotel. I only went here because other yelpers claimed it was good. To be honest, I would have walked a little farther to the Denny's because the food isn't that great and the selection isn't great either...

It really does feel like a strip club turned restaurant. Or maybe a 70s porno style Islands."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful meal from start to finish. While they provide decent sized coffee mugs, the content is subpar. The omelette I had was over cooked and a horribly gloppy thick sauce was spread over the top.  My friends' pancakes were laden with baking powder and had no flavor.

The entire place smells of smoke and, while the people watching was awesome, you can do that anywhere in Vegas. Our server was attentive, but the food was just abysmal.  Almost everyone felt slightly ill after eating. I would recommend staying away."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, unless you like to wait to be seated or a noisy truck-driver cafe type of atmosphere. Too busy ( mid-strip) and slow service. Very expensive and mediocre food. It's just not worth the hassle or the time - forget it. Go north to Denny's (near the Stratosphere)  or to McDonald's across the street and save some bread - and aggravation."}
{"text":"Need a Vegas institution? This is it!
The pepper mill is one of those places that's on the hipster places one must visit in Vegas that's off the beaten path etc etc.
I guess to some extent it still is, but it is by no means unknown or under the radar. The prices at the Pepper mill reflect the coolness of the old school here. 
Why four stars? Because silly, when have I ever reviewed something that wasn't worth the price.
I don't think that one should go down here for a full meal, it is really expensive and for not AMAZING food.
But go with your other, and fully make out by the fire as you watch Good Charlotte on the little LCD TVs that the CRAZILY added. So go, order a ten dollar drink and enjoy the old schoolness that is the Pepper mill."}
{"text":"Don't judge this book by its outer cover.  Great breakfast, great service and the coolest lounge in the back for late night.  I wish I had discovered this years ago"}
{"text":"Been here many times, and have been pleased every single time. Such a great old time vintage atmosphere with fire pits, cozy booths and tonsssss of drinks. 

Go here on a date. The atmosphere is totally romantic."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place is open 24 hours...we stumbled, literally into this place after the club (5am?)  and we definitely needed food...

I vaguely remember what I had, it was the chorizo with eggs and it was delicious, our waitress was such a sweetheart.

It was awesome!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great breakfast place, then look no further! I came here back in December 2016 and this place was poppin! However, the wait wasn't long at all, which was perfect since we were starving. I ended up getting their corned beef hash and I have to say that I got the winner dish...my dad got an omelette and my mom got eggs benedict. Don't get me wrong, their dishes were yummy too, but all 3 of us agreed that I got the winner dish! Also, the portions are very generous and the prices aren't bad! 

Our waitress was also super nice and upbeat, which definitely helped make our experience here even better! 

I honestly could have come here a few more times during our Christmas vacation, but we never made it back  Anyways, overall, come here if you're looking for a banger breakfast!"}
{"text":"The wife and I pulled into the Peppermill to start off our Vegas trip and were completely amazed at how good the chicken fried steak and eggs and eggs Benedict were. Totally recommend stopping here before hitting the strip."}
{"text":"Ate a late breakfast here. We had to wait about 15 minutes. Our service was good as they were covered up.
The ONLY negative, if you can call it that was the size of the orders. The prices were high, but not considering the size. I had an omelet that must have had 3-4 eggs plus all the ingredients.
Sarah had 3 Hugh pancakes, 3 eggs, bacon and sausage.
Everything tasted great, but neither of us could eat half of it.
Next time we will share or find smaller items to order.
I would eat here again if ever in Vegas again."}
{"text":"I was able to call ahead and put my name, which helped the overall wait time! However, good luck with parking. The Peppermill is pretty popular. If you have to wait, wait in the lounge (bar) it's very comfy and you can get coffee. The coffee is delicious! We got chorizo with eggs, and French toast! The food and portion were delicious. The reason for the star was the waiters wait time. I understand it is busy, but I think when I ask for the bill I wouldn't have to wait neatly 10 min.

Overall, wonderful breakfast experience :)"}
{"text":"This place is a great place for breakfast but my lunch meal was just ok. I got the gyro and it was overwhelmed with sauce and too many onions as well. No lettuce at all with my gyro. Also the guy seating people was rude. The place was only 1/3 full and I didn't want to sit at the bar but wanted a Booth and he became very snotty. The waiter I had was very nice. All in all its a must for breakfast in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great place for an American style breakfast, Texas sized!  Very nice ribeye steak too."}
{"text":"A Uber driver recommend this place for the French toast. My girls and I wanted breakfast, so we walked to PepperMill. To be honest, I enjoyed the lounge area and drinks more than the restaurant it's self. My girls and I got the Sunrise Mimosa which was excellent. It was made with Moscato and champagne but it was still great. The place is packed so it's great customers can go to the lounge, get a drink during their wait. 

The food was just regually 'diner' food to me. Nothing special about the Fresh? toast, bacon or eggs I had. I said light cheese on my eggs, they put much cheese on my eggs, so I would only eat a little bit. The sausage links were huge and the bacon was alright. Again, nothing exciting about the meal, thus the three stars.

I would miss this place for a better buffet on the strip if I were you."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best breakfast brunch and Bloody Mary on the strip. Love the sunken bar and fire pits. Foods always good. Prices are cheap."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday!!! BUSY af our food took forever !! I saw everything that was going on cause I was sitting on the bar. When the food was ready, it was just sitting there for 20mins & the hosts didn't know what they were doing they ALL seem SO distracted, they couldn't carry the food right, it seem like they need MORE training. I feel like they should All sit down talk with the mananger & get training again. I NEVER write any bad comment but damn ya need HELP !!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a go to spot for any time of day.  Service is always good and food comes out pretty quickly.  Like the free photo they take and give to you!

Came here yesterday for a late breakfast.  Pancakes, eggs and bacon with some much needed coffee was great and hit the spot.  The 3 pancakes were huge.  

Today I'm having the pastrami sandwich with fries (I asked for them crispy).  He is having the BBQ burger with onion rings.  Everything was good.  

See y'all next time!"}
{"text":"If Denny's had a baby with a unicorn and a strip club, it would be The Peppermill Restaurant.  You're greeted with pink, purple, and blue neon lighting with matching diner-style booths. Faux greenery including cherry blossom trees and tons of flowers give a psychedelic garden feel.  The multicolored table sugar was a fun touch.

We were seated promptly and service was great from our waitress and our cocktail waitress.

House chardonnay was decent (happy hour half price makes it taste better).  The gyro meat was straight from a restaurant supply house, but it satisfied my hankering for some lamb. Curly and regular fries were nice and crispy.  We also shared a banana split which came complete with chocolate syrup, peanuts, and cherries.  Again, nothing special but it was exactly what you picture when you think of a banana split.  A couple of girls sitting nearby took a selfie (or two or three or 500) with their Bloody Marys.  They looked like classic Marys with a celery and cucumber garnish.

They're not reinventing the wheel here, but they have solid versions of classic food with a really fun atmosphere ripe for people watching.

Oh and the restrooms were very clean and their soap smelled good. (I had a couple wines.)"}
{"text":"If you are visiting Las Vegas for the first time you gotta go to the Peppermill. Once you enter this place the decor just screams Vegas with its cool neon lights and coloful lampshades. Also, if you want to get drinks before you start your meal you can just hop over to their bar area which has a wicked cool firepit and you chill around the fire with your friends. 

Food here is pretty tasty and the portions are HUGE! (Which is great for sharing) I had the Reuben sandwich with fries and it was really good. If you want comfort food, this place has a bunch of it. Their breakfast menu is served all day so that's another plus and it's open 24 hours (hell yeah!)"}
{"text":"Amazing classic vegas diner.... a must go to place for breakfast or late night cravings. the decor and theme of the restaurant is unmatched."}
{"text":"I was looking for a restaurant that wasn't a chain restaurant, buffet, or an overpriced restaurant inside the casino.  Using Yelp! app, I came across The Peppermill.

The decor is very unique.  There's a lot of neon lights, mirrored ceilings, and fake trees.  I didn't see the fireside lounge because the wait was a mere 5 minutes to be seated.  The place was fairly busy, so service was not very fast, but you can't blame the servers for that.

I asked for a recommendation and our server suggested Munch's Breakfast.  Sausage with peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, topped with eggs and cheese?  Sounds great!  I was excited.  The meal came out and it felt like it was missing something.  It felt like I was eating a vegetable omelette - I realized that there was NO sausage.  I called the server over - not the easiest task when she's running around tending to many tables - and she said asked if I wanted to have them remake it.  I told her no since the person I came with was almost done with her meal.  She later brought out a plate of sausages.  Apparently the prep cook forgot to bring out the sausages and the cook just threw everything together not realizing that the sausage wasn't there.

I realize that mistakes happen and it wasn't the server's fault so I didn't tip her less than I would have for the service.  But I wish she addressed this with management so that they could have made some sort of adjustment for leaving out the sausage.  Seriously, that's like giving someone a car without brakes.  A chair with no legs.  A hooker with no condom.  All of the above may work but leads to an incomplete and potentially regretable experience.

So while I would probably have given this place 4 stars, I have to give it 3.  Give it a shot, but realize that the cook may be high and leave out key ingredients."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is by far one of the best restaurants /small diners I've found to date. I've been going to Vegas since I was a kid and I can say this is easily my favorite now. If you don't want to be bothered with the large hotels ie wait in long lines, surrounded by crowds of people, walk a mile from your car to the restaurant, then choose this place! Right next to the Wynn. They have their own spacious parking lot. We never wait more than 5 min to get a seat. Everything I've had was tasty and satisfying especially the wings, club sandwich, scramblers, omelets, banana split and cheese burger."}
{"text":"My favorite spot ....

Can't visit Las Vegas without making a stop at the peppermil!!!"}
{"text":"\"Good morning, cocktails for you?\" 
Wait...what? Oh...it's Vegas!

Dining here, you best not be dieting because this place is literally the definition of excess, but in a good way. I'm a sucker for benedicts so that was awesome. 
Service was really great too and the staff was so welcoming. It was our first stop just after landing so really appreciate the service.

Back in Hawaii this reminds me of Zippys or Anna Millers - that home feeling. Prices are a bit high, but for what you get it's totally worth it. Will remember this place if I ever return to Vegas in the future."}
{"text":"Unusual atmosphere (in a good way).  Very eclectic menu, there has to be something that you're craving on the menu.  Good portions, healthy or a fat laden choices served by waitresses that look like they are from hooters (jus sharing a fact)."}
{"text":"screw the dennys on the strip....this is the perfect place to go after a late night. The Peppermill is a fairly large restaurant with an old school diner feel. it's on the strip, the waitresses are sassy, and the portions are large. That and you can walk in here with a huge group of people and get seated immediately. the decor made me feel like i was in jurassic park...but i'm not sure why. something about all the greenery and the neon.

granted, i don't really remember what the food tasted like...but they have rainbow sprinkles available on every table! wheee!"}
{"text":"It's a great step back in time. The place is a romantic diner (believe it or not). I also liked it because most of the people in there like to dress, if you know what I mean. Having great drinks didn't hurt. If you ever come to Vegas...... Check it out."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger at lunch today from the bar area. While waiting a roach ran across the bar in front of me. I told the server what happened and left. Never gonna happen again."}
{"text":"Ahh the Peppermill, known for its 80's themed decor, with neon lights and colored sugar sprinkles. I have been to the Peppermill a couple times in the past few months only because I had friends in town. This isn't the type of place to hang out at often because it is pricey. The first time I was there for food, my friends and I were seated at a round half couch table in the back. It was very hard for me to get comfortable because the table is cemented to the ground so there is no way to get extra room. It was a snug fit. Next time I would ask to be sat at a table with chairs. Anyway to eat I ordered the chicken fingers platter, with fries, and my friends ordered a sandwich and french toast. The food came out quickly, they were not busy at all. I enjoyed my food, and my friends seemed to enjoy theirs as well. The portions were hearty and the price was reasonable.

The next time I had friends come to town, we stopped here to check out the Fireside Lounge and get some drinks. The lounge is inside the Peppermill on the left, and is for the 21+ crowd only. It has plenty of seating, as well as a fire pit with some comfy couches surrounding it. We sat around the pit, and ordered drinks from the happy hour menu. Dirty martini's were only $4.50 each, and we also ordered mozzarella sticks which were like $6 something. The drinks were very good, but the mozz stix sucked. The ranch was BOMB though. This definitely is not the place to make as your local watering hole, but it is cool to stop in once when friends are in town.

One thing to note is there are NO prices on the regular menu at all for drinks. They have a lot of speciality drinks, with different syrups and add-ins, but again NO pricing, so you have to assume they are $$$$. (The pricing is listed on the happy hour menu for food and drinks though.)"}
{"text":"This is exactly what I picture when I think of Vegas. We drank cocktails by a fire while extremely hungover, then ate our body weight in grease and fried pork served by ladies in nylons and polyester until we felt human again. 

Get the Munch's Breakfast with a side of bacon.  Share it with a friend.  Regain a little dignity. 

According to our shuttle driver, \"Denny's is like kissing your brother, Peppermill is like kissing your lover.\"  Verdict is still out on that one, but...

Bottom Line: I'll see you next time Peppermill."}
{"text":"This place is nothing to write about! It was a 1980's flashback. The food was not very good and neither was the service!"}
{"text":"If you've never been here, it is seriously a must! Super old school Vegas feel with lots of glass/crystal, velvet booths, actual cocktail waitresses, and plenty of neon lights. This place has quite the reputation, not to mention is super popular, so if you're planning a visit be sure to make a reservation. Even if you don't think you'll need one, you're going to need one. Wait times range from a half hour to multiple hours (during peak times). 

When you first walk in, you're greeted by slot machines, dimmed lights, and plenty of neon and rich purple. Hopefully you've made a reservation so you can inform the hostess that your party as arrived (and not that you're here to simply wait an hour for a table, because that is simply torture). She'll escort you to a plush booth where you'll take a seat and she'll let you know your server and cocktail waitress will arrive shortly. The cocktail waitress will arrive first and ask for you drink orders. Customary to Vegas, they have a huge selection of very large, very obnoxious alcoholic beverages. They do have a full bar as well if that isn't really your style. Did I mention she'll likely be dressed in old school Vegas glam? Next, your server arrives and asks for your order. This might take a minute because their menu is HUGE with so much variety. After changing your mind, four times, five time, six times okay closing the menu now... you'll tell the waitress your selection!   

The food is then quick to arrive and you will be blown away by the taste and not to mention the large portion sizes. You'll try to devour it all because it's so good, but that won't be possible. Fortunately the server will offer you a box so you can enjoy this the next day too. You'll then HAVE to make room for dessert because they have an overwhelming huge (and yummy) brownie sundae that is larger than your head. Again you'll try to devour it all, but it simply won't happen. You'll then roll out of the restaurant completely satisfied with your decision to visit!"}
{"text":"The ladies who welcomed us in were very sweet but our waitress and the rest of the employees working seemed absolutely miserable. The decor was very strip club-esque. I asked multiple times for a waitress so j could order a drink but no one ever came to take our order. I got the French Toast which came before the rest of the food and it was good. My boyfriend got the fish and chips but his fries were so hard we couldn't eat them. We never got a refill on our water and our waitress stopped by our table once before we had to call her over to get the check. We will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?? I walked two miles through the desert at 3:45 am to get here by foot, taxi, Lyft and a \"brother\" from Vietnam. This is the only place in Vegas to get your calories on son! Trust me, my dad taught me what's up. Huge servings, amazing, pretty servers, umm yeah."}
{"text":"I've been taking advantage of the Peppermill's hours of operation for a long time. Completely overpriced, too tacky for words, and an absolutely Perfect way to end a night out on the Strip.

This is a place to watch or be watched. Everyone's going to wander in at some point. From strippers, cocktail waitresses, and impersonators - to high rollers and Hunter S. Thompson types.

The Fireside Lounge is what makes Peppermill so star worthy though, like a den out of the Elvis Era, you're transported- cheesiness is overlooked, romance is rampant and we're getting trashed on Buttery Nipples; all among floral fakery, a fire pit, and fuchsia flamingos.

I Love this place. I do I do I do!!!"}
{"text":"How have I been to Vegas a million times and never been here before?! It is old Vegas and everything glam and glitzy and tacky that I love! Big menu, on the expensive side, but I'm paying for ambiance so I'm cool with that. $45 for two omelette plates and coffee. Food was solid. Good diner good, above average but not mind blowing. I'll come back if I need a big breakfast or have a Vegas novice who needs to see this work of art."}
{"text":"We had a bit of a wait but it was well worth it.  Prices seemed a bit high until we realized how much food you get for the price.  I ordered the Swiss mushroom burger with onion rings and my girlfriend ordered the chicken quesadilla. Both were outstanding! The service was great and all servers I witnessed were busy and working hard. The colorful decor with the Tiffany style lamps is a nice touch.  Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, get off your hotel grounds and have breakfast at this Las Vegas institution.  Although it looks like a throw-back to the 70's, with neon lights and a velvety scene, the food and service are phenomenal. I have never had a meal here that was not served to perfection, with gracious proportions and excellent flavor. The servers are fantastic and treat you like family, including the roaming cocktail waitress who provides drinks from the full bar.  Outstanding experience that cannot be missed."}
{"text":"This is a pretty not-up to date fancy smanshy restaurant. I've heard a lot about this place being in movies...

Free picture when dining in here :) 

We enjoyed our breakfast and decided to have a drink at the fireside lounge. Fireside lounge deserved the stars! Come here if you want to chill and have great conversation :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were having a little staycation on the strip and wanted to find a good breakfast joint before we headed out. Found this gem on yelp, I didn't read too many reviews because its strip location and bright lights made me want to try the place out for my self.
Hands down the best service we've gotten at a 24 hour breakfast place. The restaurant was super busy, on a Tuesday!! But they still managed to have us seated in under 5 minutes. We got served with drinks right away, and our waitress, Angelica was a pro. She was quick and always checked on us frequently if we needed anything. Our food came out right away. My boyfriend and I got omelettes, which were absolutely delicious and large portioned. The price was not bad either!! We are for sure coming back, and I hope this restaurant remains busy."}
{"text":"Talk about super cool and unique diner in Las Vegas. I have been to Vegas so many times and I can't believe I never came here. There is an awesome lounge to wait for your table. The food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool themed diner. I'm not sure what the theme is but it seemed very 1970s tropical. My friends and I came here for brunch on a Sunday and it was pretty packed. The food was really good and so was the Bloody Mary, which I guess they're known for.

I got the Reuben sandwich and it was definitely one of the better Reubens I've had. Some of the other things my group ordered included the corned beef hash (probably everyone's favorite), eggs Benedict, and some other things that didn't stand out.

Overall, it's worth a try if you're looking for a brunch spot on the strip that's not in the hotels."}
{"text":"This is a must do for old school Vegas fans.  Its 70s mirror laden walls with neon lights somehow work here.  Love the trees that hang over the booths.  Make sure you check out the lounge as well... I can picture Ace Rothstein still sitting in there.   As for the food, it's fresh, tasty, simple yet not elementary.  I had the chicken fried steak and eggs...amazing! Service is great and portions are huge.  Peppermill is my new go to for brunch in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I go to Vegas maybe 4 times a year and always come here everytime. The drinks
Are good I have ordered steak , wings salad , soup everything
Is always good but it's become
More of a tradition to always go
To pepper mill I was recommend by a valet worker at the Cosmo after leaving the marquee night club I ask him what was open and he said pepper mill so I told the taxi and ever since then I'm always a regular when I'm in town lol"}
{"text":"The food was great can't complain but the service sucked  so bad disappointed in how the hostess weren't on top of seating people having to wait good 10 minutes to get seated then they sat us at table where it wasn't clean . I had ask them to wipe down the chairs at least so I can sit because it was full of food crumbs left from the other pervious people & the hostess looked at me  and said I don't see anything I literally had to point it out so they can clean it . And the waiter was not on top on the refills and checking in on us if we need anything . We had waited 15 minutes after we were done eating waiting for the waiter to bring our check and never did we got up and had to ask for our tab to pay.  By the way it was not busy at all . food great! service sucked!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been to Vegas a thousand times and have never eaten at Peppermill...I could kick myself. This place has good food, huge portions, and great prices. After hitting up the club all night/morning my boyfriend and I were starving and were willing to settle for a Denny's but our cab driver decided to drop us off at Peppermill because he said the food and atmosphere is better...thank you Mr. Cabbie! 

The place is big, very neon, has a full bar, they take pictures at your booth/table, and the service is friendly. I ordered the Turkey Club Sandwich and it was DELISH!!! Huge portion and plenty of fries. I couldn't finish it all. My bf ordered the Nachos and he was about to order the large size when the waitress advised him to go with the small because it was pretty big. OMG...as the nachos approached the table everyone surrounding us had their jaws wide and I'm sure I saw some drool hit the floor. The small order was BIG and piled high with cheese, chicken, beef, beans, sour cream, salsa...it was too perfect. I tried helping him polish them off but we barely made a dent.

I'm a fan of this restaurant...I would come here anytime :D"}
{"text":"A previous review I left gave them 4 stars...I don't know what I was thinking. Making a couple of weekday visits helped provide some greatly appreciated perspective. Dinner on a Monday evening came with no delay. Being accustomed to making my visits to Las Vegas on the weekend, not having to wait to be seated (at all) was well received. Alfonso was our waiter and I almost want to give him 4 stars for allowing us to eat ourselves delirious. 

**Note: don't get the banana split unless you have 3 people to help you eat it.

With this visit only lasting under 24 hours, my wife and I wanted to make the most efficient use of our time, so we made sure the dinner was early enough for us to enjoy while leaving us enough room to return the next morning for breakfast. This time (Tuesday morning) we sat at the counter after being seated at a booth. We didn't have a problem with where we were seated but wanted to enjoy a slightly different experience. What made this restaurant stand out, beyond just having quality food, is the fact that the manager made it a concern of hers to make sure there was nothing wrong with where we were seated. That act alone shows that everyone, including management, is interested in making sure the customer is receiving good customer service from the time they walk through the door. Petra was our waitress and she was very attentive despite the crowd in the restaurant picking up. The quality of our food was consistent with all of our previous visits and I look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place forever finally had a chance. We came here early which was a bonus this place get super busy. Server was awesome! So friendly and attentive! Ordered the French Toast Ambrosia and my partner in crime got the eggs, sausage with waffles. I always forget how big the portions are, which was helpful as I needed something to soak up the night before's shenanigans. 

French toast was huge and had tons of fresh fruit and whip cream (the legit stuff not cool whip)! The waffle was very good; eggs cooked perfectly over easy! 

Next time I want to try the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict and a Bloody Mary!!"}
{"text":"What is everyone talking about! Nasty stuff fries are soggy.  Baconn was burned and old. Way over priced. Please save your $$ and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Decided to come for a spontaneous dinner since we are only in Las Vegas for one night. The portions are huge, the food is pretty great for diner food. The mozzarella sticks are literally the best I've ever had and loved their onion rings. Have had a better Philly cheesesteak but the sandwich here wasn't the worst I've had. The service was great, friendly, and quick! The decor is so retro diner and very fun to be in! It's a little pricey for the diner type foods, but what do you expect? It's Vegas!"}
{"text":"Here for breakfast this place is pretty cool and the coffee is hot and wait is not bad at all because this place is packed we got our table in about five minutes. And they have slot machines at the front door."}
{"text":"Naaah, uhmm, Naaahhh. I can't think of a good reason one would go to this joint. 
Food: Average. Service: Well Mihaela the Russian girl,  best thing this joint has going for them. Without her I'd have probably given a star or two less. So let's say service is average. Ambiance: below average. It feels like you are in some 70s themed, third world movie scene. This restaurant is not fit to be on the strip, half  mile away from encore. A good suggestion in my opinion would be to blow it up along with the next door Riviera."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS A MUST GO FOR BREAKFAST WHILE IN VEGAS!!!

The separate lounge is super cool and a great place to hang out while you're waiting to be seated. The drinks are heavenly tasting.

The food itself is phenomenal! And the portions are INSANELY BIG!!! Lastly, the prices are more than fair for amount of food you're getting.

Go feast!!!"}
{"text":"Gaudy.  Plastic trees.  Simple American menu.  Food is OK.  Drinks good.  Nothing special, but a Las Vegas showbiz landmark.  Everyone used to hang out here.  Kind of retro cool."}
{"text":"Liked the food and atmosphere here for food then drinks... Back lounge was really laid back and relaxing from the hustle of the strip. Awesome Vegas experience! Wish there was a Peppermill Portland!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It never changes and is so classic Vegas.
Its lit up like an old Vegas casino, but no gaming.  Just great food.
The Omelettes are outstanding.
Coffee is typical breakfast joint and the wait staff are really good.
Food comes out pretty fast for a place this busy.
We'll be back."}
{"text":"I can only imagine this restaurant and lounge back in 1977. John Travolta in his disco dancing clothes dancing up and down the isles while groupies are in their roller skates in skimpy shorts and crop tops rolling down the walkways. The bright blue, red, and purple neon lights reflecting from the mosaic mirror ceilings and interior trees separating patrons booths give this place some pimpish flare. 

In another room is the Fireside Lounge, a sunken area with a fireplace in the middle (now tvs) where you'll find the likes of Chuck Norris in oversized sunglasses on one side and Barry Manilow on the other chicks on each arm drinking a Fuzzy Navel and a Blue Hawaiian that matches their butt-tight groovy threads. Tatu from Fantasy Island is pointing at the disco ball saying.. De plane.. de plane!

I can only imagine those days. 

The food here is average fare. It's all about quantity here with average quality. Breakfast is served all day. Go ahead and be a kid and eat pancakes for dinner.
The pancakes here are huge. They're bigger than your face big! The quality, however, is sub par. It's too starchy. I prefer IHOP compared to the pancakes here. We also shared corned beef hash, poached eggs, (gave away my tomato to Coco), and a side of toast. Thought it was good but mostly made up of potato. 

Service here is great though with friendly waitresses who smile and are attentive. 
Prices are reasonable. It's best to share with such a large quantity of food. Expect a long line and wait especially if you're a large party. Have a groovy time here baby!"}
{"text":"This place has been awhile for a long time and both the restaurant and lounge are hot spots, but for different reasons. Both are old school, classic Vegas with the restaurant featuring classic American favorites like burgers, breakfasts, sandwiches, steaks, etc. I've been here many times and most everything I've had is good. The prices are high ($20 for a Chicken Fried Steak) but portions are huge so I guess it's warranted. I'm a healthy eater but I'd easily take half a portion for half the price sometimes. This place is super popular so if you're trying to go at a peak time, either try to find a place at the counter or prepare for a pretty long wait.

The lounge is also old school with the fire pit being the main attraction. It's dark, leathery, and open 24/7. Definitely a place you want to take a date if you want an a romantic after hours dinner. Like the restaurant, prices are higher than they should be but you just can't beat the ambiance."}
{"text":"A hidden gem on the Vegas strip!! If only I had found this sooner than our last day in Vegas. Slightly tacky decor, but isn't everything slightly tacky in Vegas? Cheap prices, large portions and delicious food! Friendly waitstaff. They take a complimentary picture for you to keep as a souvenir! The scorpion drink is huge and fabulous!"}
{"text":"Walking into the Peppermill is like walking into an alternative universe. It has the old school Vegas feel with the neon lights. The food is diner food with big portions. The boyfriend and I had a burger and a caprese appetizer for lunch and pretty much didn't eat for the rest of the day. I wouldn't come expecting great food but it's a place to stop for drinks and to take in the atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you want to eat over priced diner food at an original \"70's showy\" Las Vegas restaurant, this is the place for you. I had a BLT and a milkshake. The shake was good. The BLT was like any BLT you can get anywhere else. My husband ordered onion rings. I have to say... The O-rings were the best I ever had, which is why I give this place 3 stars.

Will I go back? NOPE! Well, maybe for the onion rings. :-)"}
{"text":"We came here to seek shelter from the overpriced-over the top vegas strip!  The Peppermill is truly a nice oasis.  Great decor, indoor trees, friendly staff,  and affordable meals makes this place stand out.  Being just north of the now main drag of Las Vegas Boulevard, its definitley within striking distance and easy to get to.  Most dishes here are under $15 and the portion size are good.  The fact that its open 24 hours immediately made this place one of my favorite places on the strip.  I got the sampler which is quite similar to the Denny's sampler but tasty!  Chicken strips, mozzarella sticks, onion rings....yup, its a diet nightmare.  The onion rings were quite notable.  The crowd is also a mixed bag of locals, tourists and vegas characters.  Highly recommend this place when you are tired of blowing your cash on the strip!"}
{"text":"Tired of trendy 'hip' lounges?  This feels like a theme of mine.  Yeah I like old school low-pretense spots where you don't go to be looked at but rather to be your sneaky self.  Of course if you sit right at the fireside portion of the Fireside Lounge, it's hard not to be seen since you sit in a circle and are illuminated by flames - but that's freaking cool!

Anyhow, this place is pretty sweet.  

The perfect escape from the main strip scene and it's definitely my go-to spot on the north side just past Wynn/Encore."}
{"text":"Our first time at this establishment we had to wait about 40 minutes for a seat which was around 11 a.m. for three people serving portions are huge but there was a wait for extra sugar and butter"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to eat when in Vegas! I had a french dip and it hit the spot! They were speedy to keep the drinks refilled. It was Father's day and well worth the 20 minute wait! Loved the old school vibe. Our server was on point."}
{"text":"I personally thought it was pretty decent. I was actually a little intoxicated (like most people in Vegas at midnight) and ordered hot wings with fries. My date ordered country fried state and potatoes. He seemed to enjoy it and it satisfied my hot wing craving. Blue cheese tasted a little funny but whatever, lol."}
{"text":"Not the best value for your money. The portions are large but not much different than any other diner but the price is certainly higher.  The flavor profile leave something to be desired. The food is just eh."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I haven't sat inside the restaurant yet, but I thought the Fireside Lounge was worth checking out. (Rolling in at 10 in the morning, no one's there anyway, so I had the place all to myself pretty much my entire visit.)

I absolutely LOVED the ambiance of the lounge. Comfortable couches surrounded by fire atop a small pool of water. But after the first few minutes, it's nothing to get that hyped up over -- but it is quite calm and relaxing.

My server was incredibly sweet and helped me figure out a drink. I ordered a mild Bloody Mary, and for the first time EVER, it was made just right for me. 

My only gripe, unfortunately, was the mozzarella sticks. They were COLD. In one of them, the cheese came out in one lump. It was like they had been sitting there for a long time, and seeing as how I was the only one in there, it didn't make a whole lot of sense as to why they weren't piping hot. Something you'd expect from a Denny's, honestly. But in the long run, WHATEVER -- you don't come all the way out to Vegas to gorge on mozzarella sticks, do you? No."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and I have been coming here since 2007 during my Vegas visits.  We have even made friends with familiar servers here and the friendly lady who runs it.  They have the best breakfasts ever - my fave is the French Toast Collage - thick Texas Toast crispy French Toast with cheese eggs and huge link sausages - awesome!  Plus I also had lunch here which was an amazing fresh spinach salad with egg and the most delicious cream of cauliflower soup I have ever tried!  I am ready to return very soon!  This is definitely worth a visit when in Vegas.  I have yet to try the Fireside Lounge but I hope to take a significant other at some point in the future!"}
{"text":"A wee bit pricey but the portions are enormous and the food is top quality diner fare. I have a healthy appetite (i.e. I'm a bit of a food hog) but I could not finish either of the breakfasts I ordered... on different occasions of course.

I had a late night burger. Very tasty.

Definite recommend for breakfast or late night nosh.

Staff is friendly and attentive. And it's right on the strip!"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours .

A cocktail server and a waitress both come to your table . 

Old school Vegas restaurant at is best .. neon and dark inside . Friendly staff and HUGE portions of food ! 

Menu serves breakfast,lunch,dinner all day long . 
I couldn't even eat half of my meal .

They can make anything vegetarian for you .. I substituted avocado and spinach for eggs and added fruit .

YUM !"}
{"text":"I've been going to Vegas a couple times a year since I was a kid... I looked at this place as we passed by and never thought about going in... then one day I decided to give it a shot.... what was I waiting for! This place is great! It is officially one of my stops every trip now! Haven't been disappointed yet. Foods amazing and portions are plentiful! I want to go to Vegas right now just for an omelet!!! Plus I won on a slot machine in the lobby last trip that paid for the whole meal!"}
{"text":"This place is a real mixed bag. I'll say don't bother with the food and leave the details up to the multitude of other reviews that said all that needed to be said.

Kicking back in the lounge, the fellow patrons are a real example of one side of Vegas. I can't hold too much against the place, but watching what had to be the most awkward romantic failures was somewhere between unbearable and utterly amusing.

The cocktails are another story. The Singapore Sling was fairly average. Some people might appreciate that, but I consider it a sin. Their gimlet tasted like drinking pure sweetened lime juice. The cocktails weren't horrifyingly expensive, but they were so weak and unimpressive that it just fell apart. The waitress was nice. Second star for her and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check out the Peppermill for dinner after hearing good things. I had expected more of a fine steakhouse, but it looked like more of a diner to me. We weren't that hungry, so went to the Fireside lounge instead of the main restaurant. We sat at the bar and played video poker and they comped our drinks. 

They have an extensive specialty drink list. got the frozen chocolate banana drink. OMG...so good!!  Well worth the $10 price, even better when it was free. 

We ordered nachos with some of the ingredients only in half and it came out correctly. 

Definitely an old school Vegas place and the decor fits that. Everything looked clean and the service was good."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for about 48 hours visiting some family friends and I had been wanting to go back to the Fireside Lounge. The friends I was with humored me, so we too the trek down to The Strip. 

As we were driving up Las Vegas boulevard, I could see the sign for the Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge. It was a bright beacon on an otherwise gloomy day. The Peppermill used to be my grandma's favorite place to go back in the day, but I digress. This review is for the Fireside Lounge.

We arrived about 3:30ish on Saturday afternoon. We had a 7 p.m. reservation at Rao's so we had time to kill. The room was pretty much empty with the exception of the section of seats that surrounded the fire pit. We found a nice big lounge area and the 3 of us parked ourselves for some drinks. The decor is a trip. Lots of neon and mirrors, but to me, it is old Vegas and with the untimely departure of the Rivera that used to stand next door, old Vegas is hard to hold on to.

Crystal was our server and was prompt at arriving at our table when we sat down. I ordered my usual Maker's Mark Manhattan, and the other two gents with me ordered a Martini and a beer. We enjoyed ourselves for s few hours as Crystal was always stopping by to check on us and make sure our drinks were good. After all was said and done for 3 Martinis, 3 Manhattans, and 2 beers, our total came out to a little over $60 which wasn't bad. 

By the time we left at about 5:30, the room started to get busy. The good news is that a younger crowd was coming in and there was enough staff to handle the people coming in. This is the kind of thing that will hopefully keep the Fireside Lounge around for a long time."}
{"text":"Your standard diner. Huge portions, typical menu, comfy seating to reflect on your crazy Vegas adventures. The food isn't Michelin star quality, but you're probably looking for some drunchies anyway! It will be perfect. A little ways down the strip but worth the work getting there."}
{"text":"Atmosphere 5 stars - Food 3 or right under 3

Imagine an episode of Miami Vice or Charlies Angels where the characters go into a neon lit restaurant (yeah, pink and blue neon winds itself inside the restaurant) with no wood bon fires and multiple TV's playing videos of random retro songs.  

Peppermill is worth getting a coffee or drink here if you're in the area.  It's scenic, although it's soul may be hidden underneath the polyster white cushions like a hushed Italian tone."}
{"text":"I was drunk....but this place has the best mozzarella sticks on the planet. The portion sizes are HUGE and you definitely get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"We had the worst service  ever the waiter never came to check to see if we enjoyed our food. I ask for ranch dressing he didn't bring it. The wings were over cooked. For a small ceasar  salad he charge me 7.00. The young man at the counter ask how was the dinner I told him that dinner was not good. He replied to me oh I'm sorry to hear that and I said why I asked if you're not going to do anything about it..They really didn't care."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. Food has great flavor. Atmosphere is fun. And staff was great. Needless to say I ate there twice in a weekend. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"yummmmay!

my friend recommended we come here for brunch before departing vegas and it was such a great idea! 

even though the restaurant is not attached to a hotel and it's on the strip but there was definitely a wait for sunday brunch.  we had a party of 6 and it took us a good 40 minutes to get seated.  

i ordered the french toast collage and it was amahzinggg.  i'm not sure how they get their french toast to taste that good, but it does.  the sausages on the side weren't the shriveled dry ones either!  my friend got the cornbeef hash and that was delicious as well.  

great place for brunch and they have bar service for breakfast so if you're a suffering a hungry hangover stop by the peppermill restaurant to get the best f&b to cure your sorrows."}
{"text":"Peppermill, ah peppermill. Not quite sure what kind of a theme they were going for here, but it definitely screams tacky. 

The menu is reminiscent of much pricier Denny's or Norm's, but the sizes are at least considerably larger.  

Service is just alright, nothing to write home about. In fact I think the waitress forgot my friend's eggs. Eggs, how do you forgot eggs when it's the most common denominator in each menu item. 

I ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, and split that with my buddy who got ribs. Yep ribs. So many it isn't just a glorified denny's after all. 

Oh and who needs alcohol when you can get a tall cup full of hot cocoa with a heaping shitton of whipped cream. Hmmmmmm whipped cream on top of more whipped cream.

The chicken fried steak was decent, eggs and taters were done well. The ribs were disappointing. Meat wasn't tender at all and it was swimming in bbq sauce. Probably to mask that concrete-textured meat. And it came with fried rice. Like chinese style fried rice. What the heck was going on with that?

I was told the eggs benedict were good. I can't comment cause I'm generally not a fan, and therefore didn't bother to try it.  I also didn't get to check out the highly acclaimed club part of the diner. LOL. Firepits and loveseats.  Maybe I'd give it a higher rating if I had checked that area out.

Bottomline, not bad for late eats, but a bit heavy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Rare is it that you get the occasional great deal on the Strip, and even better when the food itself is actually pretty good! It's Vegas, so we didn't even bother sleeping after a long, long...well, LONG Sunday night that somehow turned into 9 AM on Monday morning when we rolled through here. Luckily at that time, not much going on aside from other similarly displaced stragglers, so no wait whatsoever.

If you need some solid breakfast food (or honestly any kind of food) to cure your morning woes, then you've definitely come to the right place. Ordered the chicken fried steak, absolutely hit the spot for me. Plus the portions are HUGE...definitely getting your money's worth here. Also, if you get a chance, their onion rings are completely on point.

Service was great, decor really did remind me of those old school diners from back in the day. Honestly not sure how I hadn't been here before, but it will definitely become one of my go-to spots in the future!"}
{"text":"Their food is okay but they are open all night and day... I enjoyed my meal until I found a long strand of hair! I pointed this out to my server and she didn't apologize and didn't even offer to do anything about it.  My group was large but we were courteous and the service that we received was not deserved. 

There are tons of options in Vegas, pass this one up!"}
{"text":"The pancakes are enormous and so are the sausages.... DELICIOUS!!!! Must try these! The decor of the place is really cool. You definitely have to check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Ate @ this spot last time in Vegas. Wasn't sure what to expect as we were passing by it on the strip. But having breakfast here was a good move. Service was great. Waitress was super friendly. Had the ham and cheese omelette. Super huge portions and was really good. This spot might be a return spot next time we are back here."}
{"text":"Old school Las Vegas diner. Food was just ok. Portions are good size. 
It is always packed. I would say go for the experience. But there are better places."}
{"text":"On Monday July 25 2016 at 12:30 pm, Myself along with four friends decided to dine at The Peppermill Lounge in Las Vegas. We are from Maryland and decided to visit this restaurant after seeing great online reviews. This is probably the only vacation we will have for the upcoming year so we wanted to indulge. We had no idea we would be so disappointed.

Upon entering the restaurant it was quite busy, that was completely understandable due to the population. The hostess was taking names and party sizes to be placed on a waiting list. I asked another patron about the wait who advised it was at least 15 minutes. Once at the front of the line a friend and I waited patiently for the hostess to acknowledge us. After about 10 minutes, were still not acknowledged. However, a female patron approached the hostess while we were standing there waiting and she was acknowledged. I guess I was born the wrong sex. The hostess proceeded to ask the woman her name and party size. Before the woman could respond my friend spoke up and stated that we had been waiting to be put on the list for some time now, he stated his name and our party size.

The hostess then stared at us in a rude manner, as if we did something wrong. We patiently waited for her to acknowledge us but we had to be the ones to initiate the communication to be added to the list and seated.

After waiting 30 minutes, our party of five was seated in the dining area. The server greeted us and delivered 3 waters to our table. Keep in mind, It was 98 degrees outside, a little warm in the room and we had a party of 5. We advised our server multiple times that we needed two more waters to accommodate our party of five. The server then immediately blamed the busboy. We were not trying to be confrontational, we just wanted 5 waters as we had a party of 5. Eventually after asking multiple servers and busboys we got the two remaining waters which took way too long.

Upon resolving the initial hostess and water issue, we were approached by a bar attendant. The attendant asked us if we would like to order any alcoholic beverages, we replied Yes. 

I ordered a Pina Colada. When my drink arrived, I took one sip and instantly experienced a taste that reminded me of sour milk. After taking a sip of the unsettling beverage I called over the waitress.

I explained my concerns with the drink, she then advised me that the drink could not be exchanged but they could attempt to fix the sour taste. She stated that there was nothing she could do and sent over a manager.

The manager, I believe her name was Peggy advised me that they could only attempt to fix the drink and could not make me anything different in exchange. She then chuckled as she said \"You knew what it would taste like\". I replied, I have never had a Pine Colada taste like sour milk. She then said she would be removing the drink from my bill, but wasn't very nice. I guess I was supposed to just deal with the taste of sour milk in the prepared Pina Colada.

After getting that issue resolved our server delivered our food, but failed to accommodate our condiment request. We made six different request for syrup and by the time it was delivered our French toast and waffles were cold. In addition, three of our meals came with muffins which we did not get until we were ready to leave almost 45 minutes later. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had and will never forget the treatment we received.

Overall, the food was ok, but it came out late and incomplete. I felt totally insulted by the manager who chuckled as she said \"You knew what it would taste like\" in regards to the Pina Colada. I've had many Pina Coladas and they've never tasted like sour milk or resulted in a stomach ache. I almost feel like there was malice behind it tasting the way it did, and that's unacceptable! 

I felt discriminated against when trying to be seated, as me and my party was overlooked by the host, but other parties were helped. 3 parties that arrived after us were seated before us to be exact. Not to forget about the attitude we received when we initiated the communication to be seated. As a restaurant goer, I am totally disappointed in The Peppermill Lounge and will make it my business never to return to this establishment. I will also spread the word to family and friends.

In addition my friends who also bought alcoholic beverages stated the drinks had a weird taste. They also wanted to return there drinks but due to the managers comment they just paid for them without drinking them."}
{"text":"Yummy. The food here is amazing it is the best for you can find in all lost Vegas the specially after a long night out and about and partying and drinking and having fun this is the place that we went to right after New Years Eve it was packed but it didn't matter great service they even include people coming by to provide pictures to provide more alcohol for those of you that are hungover and also provide other amenities that you don't normally find any other restaurant the onion is great the decorations are like from the 70's and 80's altra altra 80 ish I guess you could say um and go in the Fireside Lounge because you'll never believe how amazing it is and check out the shack carpet"}
{"text":"wonderful restaurant! the atmosphere really adds the charm to a diner done Vegas style! and the wait staff is super attentive. 

food was excellent and are served in incredibly large portions, walked away very full!

didn't get a chance to check out the bar area, but definitely next time. 

my only qualm about this place is the crazy wait! I think because this place is so hyped up and the food is good, more people tend to gravitate at the usual meal times. I think next time we'll try going at a time that isn't so busy. and since this place is twenty four hours, I definitely seeing another trip in the near future!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time in vegas and food was great but the drinks are HUGE and sharable, good prices and so delicious! Full of liquor in this Real fish bowl drink i ordered"}
{"text":"It was a interesting place. It had a unusual decor for a 24 hour restaurant. It was dark and they used a lot purple and blue colored lights.  I went there for breakfast. I had the San Francisco Joe's Special, which consisted of scrambled eggs, meat, and cheese sauce on top of two baked potato skin. It was well made and tasty. It arrived very quickly.

However, it did took a little while for me to be served or noticed by the waitstaff. Moreover, they were very slow in clearing the table.  They just did not feel like clearing the tables after the previous customers left.  Even though the restaurant had few customers, there were only a  few good places to sit down.  I was not that impressed with the customer service. I recieved better customer service from a typical Denny's."}
{"text":"The peppermill was right beside my hotel and luckily the first place I happened upon when attempting to walk the strip. It looked busy and busy usually means good so we walked in. 
definitely unusual décor... I don't really even know how to describe it ... sort of like mid century design... 80's-90's color palette ... steakhouse meets juke joint breakfast diner? 
But I do have to say the atmosphere was great.
As I said, it was busy. We were quoted a wait time of 25 mins and were seated in probably 10. the greeter sat us and Jen (our server) got our drinks. She did not forget to check back on us in a timely fashion after we said we needed time to look at the menu even though she was pretty swamped with tables.  AND she was really warm, attentive and friendly throughout our meal. 
The cup of coffee was HUGE... like a 16 ounce pint glass with a handle on it. which is fine by me, I love coffee! 
I might mention the greeter warned us that their portions were large. The cup of coffee reminded me she wasn't kidding. 
So instead of ordering waffles with a side of blah blah, I got the bacon and eggs with a side of hash browns and a ... bagel with cream cheese? No kidding? And like, SUPER easy to spread  WHIPPED cream cheese... all part of the ordinary meal... yeah I couldn't finish. Really generous portions and good food! 
My GF ordered a focaccia chicken sandwich with avocado and prosciutto. I tried the chicken (not having room to even finish my own plate) and it was really tasty.  The actual sandwich was really similar to a Torta. And of course there was a mountain of golden fries on the side... I did sneak a few of these and can say they were great ESPECIALLY with the house ranch sauce. 
Good thing I walked about 5 miles of the strip after we ate!
I must say though that even after walking a LOT I was full until dinner time."}
{"text":"Volume



To be fair
There is something to be said
For a company thats lasted this long in Vegas
Loud design Loud uniforms Lovely women
And food too big to eat alone
Maybe thats their trick
A flavor and food designed to bring in couples

For that I commend them
But as far as food quality
We will add the other two stars
When the waitresses are on the menu

HOOYAH VEGAS"}
{"text":"Great size servings!! HUGH!! That's why price is a littler higher than most. But u get a lot of food. I couldn't finish my order. I had the pancakes. They also weren't that great. Very dry. Needed some favor. The choices my husband and daughter got was good. I'd recommend trying out."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. I found the food to be mediocre and of poor quality. My hash browns were not fully cooked... like they took a raw sliced potato and threw in on the grill for a bit to brown it up. The bacon was paper thin and fatty. Had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. I guess when you're serving at that volume, it's hard to worry much about the quality of the food. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was just what the Dr. ordered when we were looking for a chill place with no pretension and great 70's era las vegas cheese.

There's a restaurant to the right as you walk in so stick to the left and enter the lounge. The bar is dimly lit with neon lights and the seated area is also to the left and the rear. As you walk in there's the flaming pool surrounded by circular tables with only room enough for 2-3 people per table. There are circular booths that are comfy and make you feel right at home. The cocktail waitress was personable and gave us enough space to enjoy our drinks with friends and made sure we were taken care of. The drinks are not expensive and are made strong. The ambiance is great and I couldn't help but feel like I was in a movie scene from Casino."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after DMV for their pastrami sandwich. Never fails to satisfy. I think this is our go-to place now."}

{"text":"okay. wtf. why was my lipton cup of tea $3.35? thats like...a single latte at starbucks. lipton tea is one of the cheapest tea brand i know, and to charge me that much for a cup is ridiculous. 

i like the place n food even though its a bit more expensive than your usual denny's but thats not the problem. i'm still mad that i was charged $3.35 for my cup of tea :*[

damn you!"}
{"text":"An unassuming (and frankly unpromising) edifice by Rodeway Inn and Riviera, which Aria/Vdara bellman described as \"shady and sketchy,\" with excellent, fresh and  affordable food in portions which make abundantly clear why 5 out of 10 of the leading causes of death in America are obesity-related. See HBO Weight of a Nation for a compelling and devastating account of this epidemic. 

That said, the food is tremendous. I sat at the counter alone, waiting for a new friend to pick me up on the day of the marathon (which never came to pass due to the 2-10PM closure of the Strip). I recommend sitting at the counter whether you are alone or with one other person. 

The grilled chicken salad with a half avocado is enough to feed a family of four. They have salads, sandwiches (the club sandwich was beautiful), omelets made with 12 eggs (Maserati is popular) and onion rings which looked life-changing. 

Everything is fresh and beautifully prepared. 

Service is great but be prepared for 30 or more minute wait for lunch or breakfast. 

For those watching bill, this is a great choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner . It's open 24 hours and serves three meals all day. 

They have silly tropical cocktails which I didn't try. 

I was a bit adventurous and tried a salad with pear-cilantro vinaigrette which I didn't like. It was far too sweet. The chicken and blue cheese very good but I was in agonizing pain from being out with my luggage and unable to reach Vdara. 

It reminds me a bit of Esau's in Santa Barbara at roughly the same price point.

Men (or lesbians) will enjoy the outfits: it's kind of a Jamie Lee Curtis Trading Places Heidi get-up. 

P.S. I didn't go to the fire pit but everyone seems to enjoy that."}
{"text":"Great place if you wanna feel like you stepped back into the 70s, or so my husband says. Really romantic place to have a drink. Definitely worth the visit if having fun in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Curly fries were very tasty. Chorizo and eggs were very good. The service was not great but we had everything we needed. The price is very good for the amount of food that they serve on the plate. Large portions."}
{"text":"Sooo this place has a wide variety of food and great cooks.  BUT some of the waitresses are not sanitary when handling the food.  I went in for breakfast and at least 3 waitresses touched the customer's bread without gloves and none of them washed their hands."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for a very long time and it has always been great, but these past few days that I've come have not been so good. 

I ordered a soup and a bagel today which was quite delicious, but the service was really slow. I couldn't believe how long it took. 

After finishing my bagel, I decided to get dessert. I always get the colossal sundae here and it's usually amazing, but they kept messing up my order. I asked them to change the vanilla ice cream to chocolate, put chocolate syrup, and to remove the nuts. When it came, the  ice cream was vanilla and there was nuts. So I sent to back, and asked them to fix it. When it came back, they changed the ice cream and removed the nuts, but there was now a giant brownie and it was covered in hot fudge instead of chocolate syrup. 

I was very disappointed with their service. Compared to what I was used to, this was terrible. But the manager was nice enough to remove the ice cream from our bill. 

And along with all this, our waiter had a rude attitude."}
{"text":"Talk about feeling some of that Vegas history. I am shocked that it took me this long nearly twenty years later from the day moved too Vegas too eat here. Still have found memories of that part of the strip so underdeveloped. All of sudden see small strip mall and all these neon lights. Not just lights talk about vibrant colors and ones that flash in and out. I remember the sign out front had even more personality but notice thats gone. =( Thankfully the restaurant still stands. It almost landmark of sorts knowing the history of the place combine with some of that Vegas style all its own. Really who would think place big fire pit right in the middle of the bar/lounge right next too the restaurant. Someone walking around asking if you want free pictures with The Peppermill as background. The diner style food breakfast, lunch, or dinner at anytime. The bright colors the waitress have on. Too all the trees (think fake) inside makes you feel like walked into another world. NO disneyland but one of those things see Vegas could drum up and pull off. 

I ended up getting the maserati omelette. Not like motherload of omelettte. It was smothered with lot of goodies. The best part was the meat sauce over the top of it combine with the egg and loaded filling. I barely finish half of it. It came with tasty hash browns. I enjoyed most was the nice crispy brown on the outside but yet moist on the inside. Along with your omelette get choice of bread or muffin. I went with the blueberry muffin. Nothing too rave about but still was good. Again huge muffin. My friend also had omelette. Seeing twins just as big. No doubt getting value on the strip here at The Peppermill. 

I would could come back again! =))"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a Vegas \"must-do\" attraction.  Not only is it far enough north on the Strip to give you that old Vegas feel, it still has the look and feel of the old school, flashy for the sake of being flashy, design to it.

The real reason make the Peppermill a stop on your Vegas Vacation is for the food.  Not just pancakes and eggs and toast kind of place.  They serve breakfast all day and the portions are truly ridiculous.  The staff here is super friendly and they are always willing to work with you on the menu if you want to be a little bit creative.

On my last visit, I couldn't decide between breakfast or lunch.  I asked the server if I could combine the two and build a lamb gyro omelet.  The end result was a massive 10 egg omelet filled with lamb meat and feta cheese all smothered in  dill tzatziki sauce.  If you like Greek dishes, then give it a try.  

Incidentally, in the parking lot there was a brand new Lamborghini being delivered by West Coast Customs.  This place is hysterical, in the \"we're laughing with you\" kind of way."}
{"text":"Been going there ever since I was a little kid, one of best. I highly recommend despot their bloody marys are amazing and their French toast and biscuits and gravy are top-notch"}
{"text":"I've been to the well talked about \"pepper mill\" twice now and it did not dissapoint. Both times w did not have to wait and had a great server. The food was good and although they seemed really busy, they were available when needed. I love that the coffee cups are real size and not the tiny single cups you get at other places. They also provide french vanilla creamer which is a big deal for me. 
I ordered an omlette which was the best I've had in a while. It has a sundried tomato sauce on it which was delicious. One of the best things about this place is the piping hot blueberry muffin that you can order rather than toast. 

The ambiance is neat and kind of retro. I would eat here again while in Vegas. It's a great place if youre not looking for a buffet."}
{"text":"Good meal, and great drinks! The restaurant is set back to the typical Vegas era with amazing costumes which really brings you back! It was my first time to Las Vegas and I heard lots about the place- the only reason for a low review was our waitress seemed a little rushed and couldn't focus on providing us the best service and when going up to pay the bill with another server she seemed very annoyed our Canadian debit cards were not being accepted, when we asked her to try to swipe the card she became rude and said it wasn't policy. 

On a side note- order the Mozzarella sticks to start they are to die for!"}
{"text":"It was absolutely slammed when I went on a Sunday and we were seated fairly quick.  The decor is something out of Starlight Express with crazy neon across the entire restaurant.  The menu is overwhelming, not because it had too many choices, but because just by the wording on the menu you can tell you are about to be served an IMMENSE amount of food.  I have no doubt that if I had had a heavy night of drinking I would have probably appreciated this place a lot more, even though I found it quite good.  The enormous cup of coffee set in front of my partner was setting the bar for what was to come.  The service was a bit quick and abrupt, my partner actually made a comment about trying to find something a little less filling and I think the waitress said something like, \"Well this is all we got\" or something to that nature, but it was more along the lines of funny than it was rude.  I had the Eggs Benedict and he had the Ham and Eggs, note that every item on the menu comes with at LEAST 3 eggs.  Our food did take quite a while, but as I said, it was Sunday Brunch time and the place was packed with a line out the door.  When our food arrived it was hysterical.  My Benedict was enormous, 3 eggs spread across 2 english muffins, and the rest of my plate was covered in a thick delicious layer of hash browns,  Eggs were fluffy and light.  My partner, wow, if I could paint you a picture of how much food was on his plate...  Ok this slice of grilled ham was so large that the plate was literally layered with food instead of spaced across the plate.  The under layer, hashbrowns, above that a huge slice of ham even with the bone, and then the 3 eggs on top.  It was quite entertaining watching him attempt to eat what he could so he didn't feel like he was wasting food.  I will note that our waitress took a drink off our bill for the wait even though we never said a word and we were quite happy to enjoy each others company, so they are certainly not the kind of place that sees being busy as an excuse for not exceeding customer service.  Make sure you are hungry if you are headed here!  This is no place for snacking!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here at 10:30am after a 30min wait in which we enjoyed a few cocktails from the retro styled Fireside Lounge. The Scorpion was excellent is maybe the best drink value in Vegas ($18 for 60oz and 6 shots). We split the Primal burger and the Conquest Sandwich . Both were good but not great. Average size. Massive portion of sweet potato fries. Their massive menu is served 24/7."}
{"text":"Went to the Lounge, not restaurant. Get you ass over here as fast as you can! The 90's music with 80's vibe has never been so strong. Had so much fun just lounging, watching the fire and water, tv screens all over the place, and the chill. Oh man, the chill.

Great for a group of friends, just remember the keep it down as others are making the most of the lounge in this lounge.

Okay, prices are a bit high, but you are paying for the experience here. I will say that the drinks were good though.

Super nice wait staff. Loved the long evening gowns. Adds to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't posted a review on this place. It's one of my favorite spots in LV. They have an open bar all day - I mean it's Vegas. Their menu is vast and diverse, so you can't go wrong. The portions are huge so sharing is certainly recommended. The service is stellar - every single time I've gone I've received excellent service. 

It can get packed on the weekends, especially if you arrive after 10am. It's on the north end of the Strip so you will run into transients. They are human beings going through their own struggle. Don't complain - they would trade their lives for yours in a heartbeat. Have compassion."}
{"text":"It's obvious that this place used to be a night club of some sort, but they have converted it into an amazing family restaurant with great service and HUGE portions. They have a photographer that,roams around and takes pictures offering you a free one, one for $20 or two for $25, pretty cute and touristy.

Well lit, clean restaurant. Lots of seating and very cheery, hardworking wait staff that support each other. The lounge is cool, they replaced the stripper poles with fire pits. 

I don't think I can add any more that already hasn't been said, dine here and see for yourself, you won't be disappointed! Get something to SHARE!!"}
{"text":"Continuing my nostalgia tour of Vegas, I ended up at the Peppermill.  This place has not changed its look in about 30 years.  But somehow, it works for them.

I remember going to the Peppermill with my folks when I was a little lass.  My pop would always ask for the cocktail waitress so he could \"decide if he wanted a cocktail\".  He just wanted to stare at her cans!  Well, the cocktail waitresses must be wearing the same black polyester low-cut/high-slit dresses.  My cocktail waitress, Maribel, was cute as a button and well-stacked.  I was wondering what the interview process was like for the cocktail waitress job.  I should have asked, but didn't.  Maybe if I had ordered more drinks....

The food is solid.  Breakfast is probably what they do best and is served 24 hours."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner with good portions and an awesome chill fireside for drinking with friends."}
{"text":"Fun / funky atmosphere. Huge portions. Cheap. Good \"local\" place.  Anytime I'm in Vegas, having a meal at the Peppermill is top of my list."}
{"text":"I always recommend this 90's themed diner for its great service, ample portions and fair prices. The Peppermill is always really clean and fast but sometimes it seems like the servers disappear for very,very long periods of time which is the only reason why i cant give them 5 stars. I have been going there since 2013 and i cant think of a single instance that we didnt have to wait a very long time for a drink refill. From the first time when i went there for a lunch date, the place was empty but still a long wait, to the time i went with 15 people for a work outing, the servers did lag. 

I do always have a great time and the servers are always pretty and very nice but still..."}
{"text":"Ummm I totally kind of dig this place. And all hail my new Vegas Yelper friend Kieth A. for pointing me in the direction of the Peppermill. If I lived in Vegas I would be here probably too much for their larger than life plates, cheesy- tacky yet cool Paradise style Vegas decor and for the convenience of great service 24hrs a day. 

After the Yelpeasy party I was quite starving so we made a pit stop to the Peppermill for some late night grub. I was craving breakfast and I had a huge selection to choose from. After much convincing from our server Nick (who was quite awesome btw) I went for the Maserati Omelet. Filled with mozzarella cheese and sauteed mushrooms and then topped with an Italian sausage marinara sauce. This is totally not the type of thing I would order but I am so glad I did as it was pretty stellar. 

Our bfast portions were beyond huge. I think it was advertised as a 3 egg omelet but there had to be at least 5 eggs or they get their eggs from pretty large chickens if not. 

Nick was our server and he was great! Service was great all around from the hostess, to the guy who took our drink order and to the cocktail server. Will totally return here next time in Vegas and needed some late night Vegasy eats."}
{"text":"Mirrored ceilings, artificial trees \"in bloom\", Tiffany style lamps with pink flamingos, and artificial plants everywhere else... oh my, this is gonna be interesting was my first thought after walking into the restaurant.  After being seated at my table, I'm asked if I would like something from the bar. Hummm. It's 5pm somewhere, but in Vegas ist 9am... Oh wait, clocks don't work very well here in the desert... Bring me an Irish coffee!!

The omelette was very, very big... too big for me to finish.  Full of flavor including the home made breakfast potatoes.  The service was quite prompts, even when a friend stopped in to join me at the last minute.   My tummy was very content after leaving and hitting the shops later.  This is on the strip, but not in the popular area.  For us, it was a good choice being fairly close to the Stratosphere.  Price wise, its not a steal of a deal, but it was good and very filling... worthy of another visit when Im in town."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast here on Sunday morning. Waitress was friendly and very helpful with advising the servings are very large and worth sharing. Ordered the Denver omelette and 1 pancake to share, they were very huge servings and delicious."}
{"text":"2017 Review 42/100

Solid breakfast joint with a cool atmosphere. When visiting Vegas, my friend and I were told Peppermill was a place we had to go while in town, so we made the trip over from The Strip for breakfast.

The restaurant itself is really different, but in a good way. Interesting lighting and decor. It's very much a diner but with the feel of a lounge. Quintessentially Las Vegas, for sure.

My friend had a french toast dish which was massive. She wan't able to finish it but she loved the food. I ended up only ordering a small plate of scrambled egg whites - I wasn't particularly hungry - and those were good as well.

Really cool unique diner. I would return the next time in Vegas, this time when I'm hungry so I can really try the menu."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned this is the best restaurant in town. It's a very unique experience with a barmaid that walks around taking drink orders colored sugar on the table, a rainforest kind of feel for decor, and the super friendly staff in diner type uniforms, this is a must stop place in Vegas. The \"big as Yo face\" pancakes, are daunting when they first sat them down but oh so yummy."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always open and large portions of food. We always manage to stop in once or twice when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Just had a horrible experience at this place. Took us 2&1/2 hours to have lunch for 8. Plus they messed up on our order. Got us a well done steak instead of medium well. The waitress was pleasant and apologetic and said manger will be right over when asked it to be redone. The manager there did not even come up to the table. Instead walked half way and turned around. I guess we scared him. Took them over 40 minutes (yes I was timing them) took get the food made to order. The waitress apologized and said that we won't be charged. But instead was charged for it and said the manager decided not to charge us for the \"second steak\"!! Wow!! How sweet of him not to charge us for what was a piece of jerky!!  If you charge $20 for breakfast food, it's your responsibility to make sure it's cooked correctly!! 

When we do come to vegas we always make sure we eat here. But never again are we coming back here especially after this horrible experience. Very very slow service. Turned our good day into a horrible one. I recommended this place to a few friends but I'm sure they will read this and stay away from here."}
{"text":"Service is kinda poor. Waiter forgot to ask what kind of bread did I want with my breakfast meal and the after I received the 9oz So called new-York strip steak didn't receive my choice of bread. Prices are too high. I could of got this meal for $10 cheaper at another place for the same shit basically"}
{"text":"This is the place for breakfast in Vegas. The San Fran special is spectacular. Munich's special is great if you need the extra kick. And if you are feeling healthy, the Garden Omelet is a great healthy start. Gotta try this spot but come early on weekends or be prepared for a wait."}
{"text":"So...everyone has heard of this place by NOW right?? This restaurant is fantastic and that's probably why it's been part of the Strip scene since 1972.

The atmosphere is unique....unique in a way that reminds me of the Stardust days and vintage Vegas. Their menu even says \"some things are better left unchanged\" and when it comes to what they do at The Peppermill, they're right! They don't need to change a thing and if they ever did, it may be the worst move ever.

The menu is extensive, and the portions are LARGE and i mean LARGE. It's done on purpose to replicate what Vegas used to do before greed by the \"big guys\" set in. The food is pretty awe-inspiring, and seemed pretty robust in quality. The ambiance alone gets the 5-stars.

If you go to Vegas and don't try the Peppermill, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice and it may even result it a display of your own penitence.

Note: The company that owns Peppermill also has a Peppermill Casino in Reno, Western Village Casino in Sparks, and operates a small Casino called Rainbow Club in Henderson."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It seemed like old Vegas or something.  The portions are huge! I got the southwest chicken salad and it was better than I thought it would be."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I was a kid.  It was always good.  After years and years I came back, it is super close and convenient.  It's like I walked into the twilight zone. Very purple.  I think the servers outfits are awesome. I really like the long velvet gowns the cocktail servers wear. The price seemed high for this place.  Fettuccine Alfredo $20.  We decided to share and got the nachos as starters.  The food arrived and we were shocked, the portions were huge!  We invited two more friends. The nachos were basic, made with real cheese, olives, jalapeños. It also came with a side of beans and the canned type cheese mixed together.  I probably would not order it again.  The fettuccine was surprisingly good.  Added a little pepper then it was better.   It also came with a Caesar salad which was fine and two pieces  of garlic bread.  The 4 of us didn't even finish all the food!  At the end we waited forever not realizing we pay at the front. The server never mentioned it.  I took a peek at the bar and it looked really cozy with a fire pit.  Seems like a cool place to have a drink."}
{"text":"This place is so Vegas. There are neon lights, slot machines near the door, and waitresses in purposefully too short uniforms (it's not racy though, because they wear matching bloomers underneath.) Also, the breakfast portions aren't just giant here; they are epic. The Peppermill is the perfect place to come after a night out."}
{"text":"My friends and I ate here 3 times in our 5 days in Vegas. The food was delicious and the location is very convenient if you are staying at the Encore/Wynn or some of the other hotels at the end of the strip. 

I had the chicken strips twice and buffalo chicken wrap. Both very tasty! My friends really enjoyed the breakfast, wings, salads as well. Service was alright.

The only thing I didn't like is they have cocktail waitresses who bring alcohol rather than your waiter. The first night we went, we had no problems getting drinks. However, the last day, our waitress kept saying she would send the cocktail waitress but she never came. She finally came when we were almost done with our meal but wasn't really worth it to get a drink then. Not sure if that's always a problem, but it's just a bit odd."}
{"text":"Love this place. Ate here a few times when I lived out in Las Vegas. Food is delicious and portions are ridiculously huge! Prices are more than traditional restaurants of similar type but the quality and quantity more than make up for it. I also love the colors and atmosphere in this place. very unique and unforgettable."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such high reviews.  I guess people are more enamored by the experience than the actual food.  

The decor is pretty cool; it's definitely much more interesting than the average 24 hour diner.  There's a photographer who goes around and takes pictures. But seriously, I'm not coming here for the decor at 3am; I'm coming because I need some food after a night out.  

The food is extremely mediocre; I'd even say that it's below average in quality.  The portions are large however, but who cares how much you get when you can't eat something because it just doesn't taste good?

I understand that this place isn't gourmet, but I definitely expect food that's at least on par with the average diner.  I'd rather go to Mickey D's to eat than this place."}
{"text":"Fake trees? Check.
Indoor fire pit? Check.
Mirror ceiling? Check.
Neon lights? Check.
Gigantic servings? Check.

This place is fun! Open 24 hours a day like any cool Vegas landmark should, so you can stop by whenever you feel like eating traditional diner fare. I am a sucker for breakfast foods, so I always seem to go for the fruity french toast. However the last time I shared a philly cheesesteak (which was great by the way!) and the nachos. OMG those nachos are insane! They arrived at our table on huge plate, piled high! We ordered it with the ground beef. The cheese& bean dip, salsa, and sour cream arrive on the side. That thing you can share with 5+ people! Between the two of us, we didn't even make a dent. Our server boxed it all up for us and it still took two to-go containers! There is also a photographer that comes by to all the tables and offers you a complimentary picture. We passed on the picture, but next time I might have to prom pose with my gigantic stack of pancakes! *swoon* 

Even as a local, I enjoy the crazy decor and the food. I've been to the Peppermill twice now and both visits were consistently awesome! I look forward to my next meal dining under those fake trees."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and many occasions I run into a celebrity here but I don't come for that. The food is large portions and decent but pricey and service sometimes lack. Upscale casual with a side bar to get more privacy."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is awesome!  Great for groups. There is a lounge area to get drinks. Food was delicious. The servings were big enough for two to share. I wish we would have heard about this place 10 years ago.  This will be a definite stop next time we're down."}
{"text":"I've never been here until my boyfriend took me here for my 21st birthday. The place is pretty big. Once you walk into this place, the restaurant is to your right and the bar lounge is to your left, just gotta walk through the doors. I love the theme. I can't really put my finger on what it is but it's nice. 

The ladies dress in cute dresses walking around in the bar/lounge area. And their most famous thing in the bar/lounge area is of course the fire pit. Oh, and I suggest everybody to try the Scorpion. It's good.

The restaurant serves huge portions of food. A group of 3 or 4 people could order just their nachos and share the whole thing. All of their food is good. 

Oh and just so I don't forget they have a photographer walking around taking pictures at every table at the restaurant and the bar/lounge area."}
{"text":"A las vegas instution! This place defines las vegas. There something here for everyone. Drinks, good food, and a excellent atmosphere. They have a huge cocktail menu, with just about any drink you can think of. There fireside lounge is what they are known for, its a comfortable setting with purple velvet booths and big screen tvs. The menu is just as big serving classic diner comfort food. Great staff always friendly, and never had a bad meal here. The prices are very reasonable too, and you never leave hungry."}
{"text":"Great value for your Buck. The dinner salad is the size of an entrée and the steaks super juicy. And save room for desert, we had the Brownie a la mode and talk about super chocolate and fudge. Finger licking good."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. They were really busy, but i didn't hold that against them as we were sat right away. The booths are soooo small, but I'm also not a small person. It just made it really uncomfortable it sit there. The food way large in portion, but just okay in flavor. Now, the atmosphere was awesome, and i really wish i went back at night time. I probably wouldn't eat here again, but might go back for the fireside lounge."}
{"text":"We came here one slow July morning on our trip to Vegas and we were pleasantly surprised.  When we walked in we were greeted by a 70s style motif.  I felt like I should be in scene from Pulp Fiction.  Once we were seated in our booth (which was vinyl with glitter embedded in it) our waitress promptly got us water and coffee.  The coffee was standard diner stuff.  I ordered pancakes, eggs, potatoes, and sausage which was all very well and good but nothing groundbreaking.  My wife ordered the fruit plate and that is where the magic happened.  This fruit plate was HUGE!!!  So big, in fact, that we took about half of it back to our hotel and ate it with a bagel for the following breakfast the next day.  It had strawberries, kiwi, oranges, apples, cantaloupe, watermelon, and probably other stuff too.  I would definitely recommend coming here if you are ever staying at the north end of the strip in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has that old school Vegas feel. The food was good and priced just right, so if your out drinking all night. You should stop by and get your grub on!!"}
{"text":"Fireside Lounge is another world, and I want to live there. I started or ended up there FOUR nights out of four last time I was in town. This is an especially awesome experience if you are staying at the north end of the Strip - Stratosphere, Riviera, Circus, etc. I recommend the bottles of cheap bubbly, ordered several at a time."}
{"text":"I see all of the 4 and 5 star reviews and I think, I wanted it to be like this!!!  Unfortunately, I cannot say that it was.  The service started off bad and got worse....  the water was...  dreadful....   their ice was so bad that it ruined the taste of Soda, the alcoholic drinks and Im sure anything else it came in contact with.  (it was so bad that when I had my friends that were with me over for drinks a few weeks later, I advised them that my ice was not from the Peppermill) The quality of the food was poor and tasted funny.  Our waitress was very cold and short and didnt do anything out of the norm to impress me.... i am not saying that she should have, but a smile would have helped....    I will not be going back to this place... for everyone else, good luck.  It seems like some people have had great luck here."}
{"text":"I enjoyed traditional  american food.  It was very tasty. I order a burger. I was on a burger vengeance around 11/2014/ The lounge was colorful. We stat around the fireplace which was a little small area.  Other than that it's a little hide away bar."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices  Great bloody Marys for those slow mornings"}
{"text":"I used to like Peppermill, especially the one in Reno but it has been awhile since I have been one. The food is terrible. The service was ok thus the one extra star. It was the worse pancake I ever tasted. I was flat, tasteless, and overcooked. A frozen toasted pancake would have been better. The crab benedict was uneatable. The lukewarm frozen, probably microwaved crab meat make me feel sick. The hollandiase sauce has so much old bay seasoning it tasted powdery, as if I was just tasting seasoning. The hash browns were cold but I ate those because I was hungry. We left the food and ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"The décor is so FUN!  The service is amazing.  However, I will be back every time I'm in town for the best breakfast ever.  If you visit Vegas - this place is a must.  Wait in line if you have to because it is worth the wait.  So let me get back to the food.  I'm picky and very hard to impress because I've gone to fantastic diners, 5 star restaurants and I can cook too but this place impressed me with the food.  Huge portions and the variety was hard to choose so we picked a few and shared. Seriously didn't know which omelette I liked better."}
{"text":"This place is always the late night go to spot after any event, party, concert, anything...
The food is good the cocktails are good.
Old school fun stuff. 
This is also where you take a date when you're just trying to chill, makeout, and chat. (Lol)
The food is good and  he drinks are awesome. Also everything is reasonably priced. 
Like I said, it's a local hotspot for when you're ending the night. (And sobering up before going home) 
Parking is awesome because they have a massive lot. 
The place is split between the restaurant and the lounge the lounge has that fire pit that's also pretty cool, if you can snag a spot there you'll get the full peppermill experience. Haha. 

I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fast service and great food one of the best restaurants if not the best in Las Vegas , I suggest everyone in Vegas give the pepper mill a try if you live in Vegas or only come to visit"}
{"text":"Tacky spectacularness!!!!!!!!!!!!  

Jacuzzi firepits... Velvet booths... Neon lighting piping through the mirrored walls... This place is Vegas at it's finest.

I was first introduced to The Peppermill back in 2003 by my cousin's friend who swore it was the only place to go in Vegas for breakfast.  5 years later and I have to go at least once a trip every time I'm up there.

Honestly, the food is just typical diner fare.  I can't say there's a stand out in the food category besides the fact that the portions are GINORMOUS!  The thing I make sure to order every time is their signature Bloody Mary.  It goes down soooooooo easily after a good night in Vegas.

Go for the cheesefactor, if not for anything else.  I swear, you'll be stoked that you did."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS SPOT! Only downfall is you can only order appetizers in the cocktail room.. 

:("}
{"text":"Long wait. Bathroom to small. But all that can be overlooked cause the food was great!!!!"}
{"text":"great food we loved the atmosphere and the service that was provided. The only draw back was the wait time but then again I can really hold that against them with the great food that was served I now know why the wait was so long."}
{"text":"This place is U-MAZ-ING!   Be prepared to wait but it's ok! Go have a bloody Mary at the lounge area while you wait! BEST Bloody Mary ever and it's the perfect amount of spice. 

I enjoyed the eggs Benedict with hashbrowns. It's a pretty good size servicing and the coffee is really good. Always topped off don't have to ask. Service is really good and the place it fun and clean. 

Only thing is they should update the restrooms. They look dated and musty."}
{"text":"****The Food & Prices are Worth the Wait****
We actually were looking for places around the Westgate and found this place on Yelp that was highly recommended, so we decided to give it a try!  It is located by the Riviera & Circus Circus on the strip, so people are able to walk off their food afterwards because there is a lot of food coming your way!!!  

1. Be prepared to wait-Giving any place in Vegas that is good and that does not have a reservation option, be prepared to wait.  There is not much seating areas up front so they will offer the lounge area to wait (highly recommended!) but usually everyone is waiting outside.

2. There are large booths & typical bar seating-There is plenty of room to sit and the decor is straight up vegas style!  If I blinked twice I would have thought I was in a party bus with trees!  I loved the seating arrangement and everyone was in a good mood and can easily talk to the booth next to you!

3. Waitresses were awesome (both times!) They let you know what is great on the menu and I did get everything in a timely manner...even though they were slammed!

4. Food for Days- For the first round, I received the breakfast pancake platter and the size of everything is incredibly huge!  You pay around 13-14 dollars, but it is worth it (especially if your hotel room has a fridge, you will have leftovers!)  The second round I got the French Toast Ambrosia...this I highly recommend!! French Toast with a whole bunch of \"fresh\" fruit on top smothered in whipped cream (if you want) with blueberry sauce!!! YUUUMMM!

This place does not disappoint!! I cannot explain about how much I love this place and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Whrn they say the portions are large. They are not kidding.
Could not finish the whole meal.  Nobody in our party could their meals.
Not a fancy place,  but comfortable, covered with neon.
Wait staff kind of short with customers, might be cause they were packed and running their butts off.
Located on the north side of the strip."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and such big servings...each plate could feed two or more people! I had Joe's San Franisco omelette...musta had four eggs in it! and Grace ordered pancakes...too much food, but all good!"}
{"text":"Nothing about this place was good. The decor...bad. The food, regular diner food with a prices price tag.  The clientele was interesting. Friends told us to go.... Won't be back.  Try for yourself though. A lot of folks dig this place."}
{"text":"Extremely good food reasonably priced in a nifty little environment. Very comfy. Nice waitresses and bus staff. Great location. Easy Lyft and Uber pickup spot, too. 

I have had Sin City BLT a few times. Never disappoints. Bacon is crisp and delicious. They add sliced avocado and an over easy egg.  Served on texas toast. Good eating.  Abt $12. I've made two meals of it before. 

Crispy fries done right. 

Bathroom a little worn and not going to win any awards for cleanliness but it serves well. 

Glasses never go empty.  Great service. Love it here."}
{"text":"It's a lounge, baby!  This is old swanky Vegas at its trashy best, complete with indoor fireplace.  You must go and have a cocktail.  Heck, stay for dinner.  Or do as this website sez and have a nice makeout session:  http://www.vegas.com/nightlife/bars/peppermill.html."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. If your turkey burger was too dry and inedible then you should not be told it's because you should have ordered a beef burger. Some people don't eat beef! And you basically confirm that the turkey burgers here are gonna be and suppose to be dry. So don't order that here! And if you do, you won't get a refund! You have been warned!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about it! The Bloody Mary, the ham & cheese omelet, the potatoes, everything! We were in LV for 3 days & ate here twice!"}
{"text":"Peppermill is really killer and a great example of how to re-build an old strip club into a trendy loung! Lol. Neon, mirrors everywhere and a fire pit. Throw in some delicious signiture drinks and you've got Peppermill.

Peppermill is a resteraunt on the right side of the enterance (boring) but walk thru the glass double doors on the left... and now you're talking!! Really chill vibe with red round couches, neon light rims, plastic plants around the room and a fire pit in the corner of the room.

Its low to normal noise level with music playing to videos on monitors thru the lounge. Smoke levels are very well maintained, but smoking and vapping are allowed. 

Some basic bar food options are available along with a delicious array of signiture drinks. Pretty inexpensive prices for drinks considering it is located on the strip. I highly reccomend the Blue Hawaiian for a sweet strong drink. Check the pictures of what was on tonights order!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years! I love the tacky blue and pink Vegas Style diner with its maze-like booths and extensive menu.  The portions are huge and the rainbow-colored sugar is a great novelty.  The Fireside Lounge is a great relax place with the same perfectly tacky old Vegas set up.  It's open 24-hours too, so that's a plus.

I chose 3 stars because, though the portions are large, the food is just okay.  I can't say anything here has ever Wow-ed me as far as food was concerned.  Furthermore, I don't believe I have ever received really good service on the dining side.  Most of the time, the servers are disinterested and not really that hospitable.  You food will come out when they have time to bring it and they will bring refills, side sauces, napkins, etc. when they can, but don't expect extra added niceties or say a local joint or service based restaurant. 

However, in the lounge, I have had some great experiences with friendly bartenders and servers (with the long black dresses on)."}
{"text":"they do not accept reservations. we got on the list and somebody mentioned you can wait at the bar if over 18. So we went there (so 70s) sat and watched a game, tried the chicken Quesadilla which was very good and a lot of chicken. Best, one can hear the hosts announcements, so you don't miss out when they call your table.

Professional and good service, everything was smooth, its like a machine. Food was good, I asked and was told they use for each omelette 8 - 10 eggs! That's insane!  The nachos can probably feed 5 persons, my Focaccia Chicken Sandwich was not that big of a portion. was good. I would go back to the place."}
{"text":"Late night vegas food. I had the corned beef hash topped with eggs and served with toast. Huge portions, I couldn't even finish it all. food came out hot and fast just like you would expect at a diner like this. If I'm back in Vegas I would def go back. Cheap too!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is such an awesome diner, one that encapsulates Las Vegas. The poker machines at the entrance are just the start - it's the chain smoking patrons, neon lighting and artificial trees that really give it its charm.

Food here comes in large portions and is big enough to feed two people. Omelettes run a little, but the hash browns are just crispy enough and cooked to perfection. And as a bonus, there's an attached bar!"}
{"text":"Maaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

IT'S OVER!!! OVER!!!  Hands down the one place that you HAVE to eat at, at least once when you are in Vegas is the Peppermill!  For all you gamblers who like to spin 2/3 of your day at the tables... eat here first!!  The biggest fricken Chicken Fried Steak I've ever seen!  Seriously the size of a plate... The Nachos (where'd my girl go)? They shouldn't even call them Nachos... I had to look around them to see her.  I was sooooo faded I shouldn't remember this place.. 
Peppermill can you send me a frequent buyers card?  I love you! I love you!"}
{"text":"Imagine partying and being out all night in \"The Vegas,\" fueled up on adrenaline, eight shots of Gray Goose, six Red Bulls, four lines of nose candy, and maybe two hits off of a gravity bong. In other words, you're freakin' wasted. 

Your world is starting to spin and you need some food to keep functioning (and to ensure you don't puke or OD). You stumble into a Denny's and you are blown away by weird neon colors, friendly service, and good food at great prices featuring out of this world portions. You are so amazed by the experience you feel you as if you are dreaming, high, or both.

Well, the paragraph above pretty much describes my recent experience(s) at the Peppermill, except that I was not on a Charlie Sheen style bender. Even stone cold sober and pissing holy water, I was amazed by the food, service, and of course, the neon colored look and feel of the place.

After a long day of traveling and working, I came here for dinner and had a delicious half pound burger with grilled mushrooms, Swiss cheese, crispy bacon, fresh produce featuring onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and a delicious dill pickle that Snookie would salivate over. With my entree, I was given the option of a side of fries, curly fries, or onion rings. I opted for the hot and crispy curly fries. And when I say side, I mean a 2,500 calorie mountain.

It was a quality meal and well priced ($16 including tip), considering it was more than enough for two people or maybe even three. But of course, being a nasty pig, I devoured the entire burger and ate as many curly fries as a I could until I felt there was a pimple forming at the end of my nose. 

I was so impressed by the meal and the service, I let my impressive server (who was in training at the time and being shadowed by another server), that I would be back the following day. As I wasn't pulling a Charlie Sheen, the next day I kept my word and returned with my coworker. Word is bond, yo.

This time around, I had a chicken focaccia sandwich filled with thick slices of avocado, prosciutto, provolone cheese, all served a side of Balsamic vinaigrette. The sandwich was delicious. This time around I opted for some tasty onion rings that gave me enough grease on my face to start a fire, a small pimple, and a pair of busted slacks. Whatever. I like being fat. No, really. I swear.

In the end, this has become one of my new favorite places to eat in \"The Vegas,\" even if the food makes my face look young (greasy and pimply) and body look old (round and fat). Good food and good times, even without a Charlie Sheen recipe for disaster."}

I ordered cornbeef hash crispy (WELL DONE) and it came out in a deep dish like baby poo with tomato and cucumber. That's wrong. maybe the cook had a bad day. I will go back because my family really likes the place"}
{"text":"Pros:

Time honored diner.  Fabulously large portions.  Great staff.  Easy parking.  Penn Gillette (sp?) comes here for a reason.



Cons:

JAMES.

Do not let this unpleasant, surly, rude, obnoxious man unnecessarily bring the atmosphere down in such an vaunted, loved, time-honored institution such as this.  

This is a HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY place.  The staff here works very hard to provide a positive, uplifting atmosphere for the thousands and thousands of guests from all over the world that come here.

A hostile and arrogant bar tender (who scalds himself on hot coffee by not holding the handle; and charges people for non-alcoholic drinks while they're PLAYING) is not what this place needs.

Absolutely not.  Me and the other guests will not return to a place that has someone destroying thei atmosphere.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and sucky all at once. I went once at 9AM and once again 5AM later the next morning. Don't order a chrorizo omlett, because there isn't one on the menu."}

you cannot go wrong for cocktails and chilling or grubbing on food.  friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"Nice pit but be prepared to wait! And wait! And wait...The food proportions are really large, so bring your appetite. We had a burger, philly, pancakes, and benedict. Everything was good, a little bland nothing extraordinary, in terms of taste. I had the burger and thought it was fair.. I have been there twice and both times suffered through the wait and could not take anything with me, being I don't live in Vegas...But it was my last time...give it a shot if you don't mind waiting they have slot machines and a small bar with a firepit..."}
{"text":"After a very very I mean very long night at prive, we were starving! We decided to head to the peppermill. Our taxi driver that took us there was crazy... i mean i think he smoked some crack before he was driving, but he was cool though.. he knew everything about the peppermill, and told me to get the fruit bowls.He said, \"It's the best fruit bowl you'll ever have in Las Vegas\" hahaha lol! Let me tell you... the fruit bowl was nasty. Don't order it.  Food was great, i love the stripper theme, that's always hot for a bunch of drunk people. The worst part about this place is that no taxi's will pick you up from here so beware... come here with caution if you're drunk! You'll have a long walk back to you're hotel, unless you're staying at sleezy hotel like the riviera, or circus circus."}
{"text":"Don't let the building fool you.  It looks like an old school diner and smells like cigarettes especially in the bar but the food and service in the restaurant was unbelievable. We were pleasantly surprised. Best Reuben, grilled cheese and burger ever. It's like dinner and a show with the fun people watching. Food is plentiful and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Everybody I asked at my hotel recommended the Peppermill Restaurant. It was a short wait , about 30min. The food was plentiful and tasty. I would come back !! It's a variety of food so it's plenty to choose from . Overall it was a good choice."}

{"text":"when i used to live in vegas, this was the joint to take dates after dinner to sip on some sexy shots of sambuca by the fire pit...

now im married and took the wife there for cocktails... its still pretty cool..."}
{"text":"Husband and I went for our anniversary.  Staff was nice. Our waiter Alfonzo was excellent. We were a little disappointed though. While the decor was colorful, this place is nothing more than a glorified diner, doesn't match the hype it receives. A tourist spot, offering no discounts for locals. Typical strip eatery. Prices were high, portions were average. Doubtful we will ever return."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! The food is always excellent and the portions are enormous. I want to say their omelets have like 6 eggs in them (or more). Seriously, come hungry or be prepared to take home leftovers. 

When a place is 24 hours and they serve breakfast the whole time, I tend toward breakfast food. That being said, their eggs benedict is one of the best in Las Vegas. Burgers are delish and cooked to order (beware asking for rare...they take it seriously and will produce something pretty much raw on the inside). The service is great. Waitresses are attentive and friendly. There seem to always be cops eating there; take what you will from that. 

Downsides: The place gets crowded. Really crowded. Weeknights seem to be the best time to go if you want to sit down and eat quickly. Also, the parking situation can be difficult. They have an itty bitty parking lot in front (maybe more in the back, not sure!) right on LV Blvd, so getting out can be tricky. 

Bottom line: if you haven't been, go for the decor. Stay for the food!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a gem!  

Went here on a suggestion from our Uber driver and it was great!  Great food, super sized portions, and great service.

There was a 45 min wait but had a great time sitting at their fire place lounge.  Servers were great, host was efficient and the restaurant is a definite plus!"}
{"text":"We waited 25 minutes for a table and is worth every minute!they make u feel comfortable while your waiting.u can gamble n have a drink while you wait and they announce it over the loud speaker.it was cool!and nice!the french toast was amazing and the bavon melted on your mouth.it was soooo yummy!there portions are huge!i will come back to the peppermill  everytime im here for sure!"}
{"text":"Big portions 10 egg omelets great prices long wait times arrive early. Would come back again!! Lots of options good kids menu."}
{"text":"A true Las Vegas classic and it took me about ten trips to Sin City to check this one off my list. Tucked away in the 'no man's land' north of Wynn/Encore and south of Riviera, this place is easy to miss unless you're up for a bit of a hike from mid-Strip or have a car at your disposal. My party started with the appetizer sampler platter which could've nearly stuffed the three of us in and of itself. Hand-dipped onion rings, bruschetta and fried mozzarella sticks that were obviously also hand-cut and hand-dipped. All with the requisite dipping accoutrements. So happy. Two of us had the giant pesto burger as an entree and as delicious as the medium-well (ordered medium so I'll order med-rare next time) beef patty on brioche was, I could only eat about half. Good thing I had a fridge in my hotel room as this made for a wonderful snack (even when cold) the next evening.

The atmosphere is as many others say. Like a fully-blown Vegased out version of an all-American diner. Think Denny's with a neon problem. Just lovely and fits the Strip to a tee. Service was great the night we were there and beverage refills were quick and without having to ask.

We stepped into the separate lounge next door to have a look before leaving and were simply awestruck. Why did we bother with the restaurant when we could have certainly ordered from a bar menu here and enjoyed giant frou-frou drinks while we waited. So that just whet my appetite for my next sojourn to Vegas.

It's a timeless classic in a town that insists on constantly reinventing itself. Just go. It probably won't change or close anytime soon, but don't take any chances!"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to dine here at first but once our orders came out, I was impressed! Their steak and eggs were unexpectedly delicious! 

As for the wait, this place is pretty popular so expect to put your name on the list if you go at prime serving hours. 

Do NOT order the pork loins (too bland and tough) but DO order the steak and eggs. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"I think for the most part the quantity of food you get at a restaurant is inversely proportional to the quality of food. This holds true for the The Peppermill Restaurant. They offer giant portions of food (one plate can feed 2-3 people). Thats all great but the food isn't that tasty. Their pancakes were so dry that they absorbed all the syrup and saliva in my mouth making it impossible to chew. We also had an omelet and another dish. They were both average at best. I like the look and atmosphere of the restaurant, just not the food."}
{"text":"One of a kind diner in Las Vegas, love the place, the food are ok, don't expect a 3 stars restaurant, but is pretty decent. It's a place that you must go while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I don't eat eggs and most of the breakfast meals come with eggs. We ate there twice during our stay in Vegas and my boyfriend loved their San Francisco eggs or something to that effect.

I had sandwiches both times we were there and they weren't bad. The coffee was ok as well. The service wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"I think this is a place to go late at night / early in the morning hours. We were there for dinner, and nobody really liked what they had. The gyro sandwiches were just ok. The bruschetta wasn't very good. The garlic bread for it wasn't v. garlicky, and it was cold. The spinach salad was old spinach leaves, and tasteless bacon bits. We were there for an early dinner. I know we disappointed the cocktail waitress because we didn't order."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE RULES !!!!   great food,, open 24/7 great bar, great counter,great location. This place better be here for ever !!! If you are in Vegas and you need food and don't want crap fast food, or don't want to spend all your cabling money at some fancy place, this is the place. its clean, good service and the food is great. big portions, easy to share. You can get full bar served to your table as well. My faves are the omelets, and they have the best bagels and cream cheese! Big salads and big burgers and hot food also. GREAT pasta meals. then once you are done eating retire to the bar and try to get a seat next to the fire pit. you will see some interesting people mozy through there. Just sit back and relax and have a few. A must for any Vegas trip...."}
{"text":"Awesome,  cool 64 ounce drinks by a retro fireplace followed by chicken fried steak with a sunny side egg on it with a jumbo fruit plate under a fake tree. Don't ask, just do it."}
{"text":"This place is so good!!!! I had their fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, it was amazing!!! The taste was great and the size of the meal was huge!!! I didn't even come close to finishing it all before I got full!! My boyfriend got the stack of ribs, which he loved and I tried them too and thought they were great!!! If there's a wait time, it's worth the wait! We sat in the fireside lounge to kill time and didn't even notice the wait. The service is always great!!! We love it!!!"}
{"text":"I only ate in the Peppermill restaurant and I didn't go to the Fireside Lounge.  I like the jungle ambiance of the restaurant and the service was fast. The food was also good, but it wasn't a knock out and it definitely was not the best late night food I've ever eaten. But in a city that claims to have all this late nigh food, I'm glad at least the peppermill is around."}
{"text":"Awesome strawberry margaritas!  Fire lounge atmosphere is very chill also have great appetizer options to choose from and the portions are huge! Perfect if you have a date or just chillax and hang out with your friends."}
{"text":"The food was subpar. Sure, it had a cool atmosphere but I could barely eat my omelette. I was especially disappointed since other reviews bragged on the breakfast food. On the way out I checked out their lounge in the back (which is super cool). That being said I would only come back for drinks in the lounge."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town, hands down! I mean, go slap your mother and tell her to stop cooking because you found the HOTT spot in town. 

Been coming here for 20 years and the ladies have never let me down. Coffee is alway black and HOTT as the devils ass.

Fireside lounge is a great spot to flip your lid or just catch a buzz, either way their not rapping your bank account, just a little tickle."}
{"text":"Friends and I recently visited the The Peppermill for breakfast. It was a bit busier than expected considering it was Wednesday morning at around 10:30. The prices seemed a little stiff until the food comes up. Let's just say the portions are huge! If you are trying to avoid taking food home, it might be a good idea to split an entree.

I ended up with the corned beef hash. As I mentioned above, the portion was huge. The corned beef hash wasn't really my thing and would probably try something different next time. The lemon-cranberry muffin that came with the entree was bomb though!

If you are really hungry and wanted something to eat, I would definitely recommend The Peppermill!

4 out of 5 stars for lots of value, nice staff, and decent food. Seems like the establishment can get busy, so please keep that in mind."}
{"text":"First time here for us! Food, Drinks and Service were Very Good on a Wednesday night.. They are open 24 Hours and serve breakfast, lunch or dinner at anytime. I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"These stars are for the ambiance of this place. It is quintessentially Vegas. The rainbow sugar, the dark lighting, the neon lights, the fireside lounge, the brightly colored booths, the trees, the layout. It's a fun experience, especially for late night eats. Food is ok. It's your typical diner fare. I had a BLT and French fries. Solid dinner, but nothing out of the ordinary. But we have come here several times because again, it is \"so Vegas\""}
{"text":"Awesome time at the Peppermill. Classic vegas. We went at 3am and the place was pretty busy. Lots of people coming from partying the night away. Service was great and very friendly. They have an amazing and extensive menu - anything you could possibly be craving, they got it. We ordered a steak omelette (not on the menu, but you can ask for one) and a steak with fettuccine Alfredo. The cocktail waitress comes separately than the server and our drinks were stiff and fairly priced (for Vegas). A girl taking photos also comes around, and it's the basic drill. You get one photo for free (a souvenir style with your photo placed amongst a collage of the Peppermill) and then you can purchase additional full size photos. As for our food, I truly enjoyed my steak. I asked for medium rare, and it was tasty, but could have used a bit less cooking - I enjoyed it though. Fettuccine was awesome. After we ate we spent some time in the lounge which basically looks like a strip club - and that is awesome! Very comfy and kitschy. This is going to be a staple on any future Vegas trips."}
{"text":"Went twice while I was in town last. No regrets because the portions were stupid and the food greasy. This place is the quintessential breakfast experience of Vegas and everyone who's been in this town more than 5 years knows it. I'm lucky as I happened to be hanging with people who knew this town in and out. 

Did a chicken fried steak in the morning. It was huge. Diet be damned. 

Amazing place to hit up after night of drinking. 10/10 get drunk, stumble here and regret the food later. But don't regret. 

Not Vegas extravagant, more just glutton extravagant."}
{"text":"Our family and friends from out of town visited the Peppermill for dinner.    The staff was very accommodating with our two young children.  We generally need to order food for the boys as soon as possible in order to have things not melt down and the staff addressed it in less than two minutes.  The menu is classic family restaurant fare.  Solid, cooked fresh, and good.  Nothing we had was outstanding but just solid good food.  The ambiance is classic 70s ultramod.     Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was an equal pair. Enjoyed the hash browns and country fried steak. Pancakes were fluffy and delish! Will make this a for sure stop next time."}
{"text":"I love this place.
Yes it is neon and tacky heaven and the waitresses in the diner wear outfits made out of me mammy's old curtains, but it is just so damn good a diner. Good food, huge selection, super friendly staff (except one lady who looked like she wanted to chin me, because she brought me a Dr Pepper when I ordered a Coke) and the Fireside Lounge is the stuff made of legends.
The Fireside Lounge is a dark den, that is lit up by neon trim and pool of bubbling water with fire coming out of the middle. Pure class.
The crowd is eclectic as hell. You will get vaguely normal folk from the strip who have heard of the legend that is the Peppermill mixed in with crazy folk who have been there all night playing the video poker machines and rumour has it the odd lady of the night with that something extra that you really do not want to see!
If you go to Vegas you have experience the Peppermill it is one of a kind."}
{"text":"Our party of 9 got seated in about 20 minutes for breakfast. I ordered the Italian omelette with the lemon muffin, it was huge! I only finished about a third of it. My friend ordered the nachos and barely made a dent in them, but they were very tasty too."}
{"text":"My dinner was wonderful there, but alas it was the Fireside Room that made the overall experience beyond awesome.  What a nice place to hang with friends and strangers alike.  The atmosphere is intimate.  The staff is quick to help you, and time flies while one is having fun there.  Hands down I wish we had something like the Fireside in the Twin Cities."}
{"text":"GREAT place to go for drinks,romantic conversation (in the bar) or bring the whole family kids and all! 

HUGE plates of food for NON strip prices! I love this place! Great drinks,great service and you may just get to see Miss Holly Madison! 

I will ALWAYS be bringing visitors here when they come to Vegas, its a staple!"}
{"text":"4 stars is not for the food but for the service. Waitress was unpleasant during the first trip and we sat for 20 minutes before she took our order. And that didn't change much during the second visit which we had the same waitress.

But although the service is on the slow side, the food is fantastic. 

We Ate there twice so far first time I had the Marco Polo Omelet and YUM is about all that needs to be said. 10 egg omelet was way more than I could eat, but every bit was delicious. My boyfriend and his brother in law had the corn beef has with the braised egg just as it was on the menu. They both said it was alright and could have been cooked just a little more to make it crispy rather than mushy, but again the portions were huge.

 The second visit it was just me and my boyfriend and we got pancakes and biscuits and gravy to share. We should have just stuck with the pancakes, not that the biscuits and gravy was bad they were very good. It was just way to much. We couldn't even eat half of the pancakes as there was three of them as big as a dinner plate, and some of the best pancakes I have had. 

We still have another 5 days in Vegas and we will be back again before we leave."}
{"text":"My husband and I renewed our vows at a Vegas chapel (by Elvis of course) so it seemed only appropriate to go to one of Vegas's oldest restaurants.

This place is cool inside. SO old Vegas, neon lights, cheescake, large. I loved it! 

The food was decent for this type of place. I wasn't expecting Mastro's quality food. My mom and I got the Southwestern beef kabobs. They were ok. A bit overdone for my tastes. My husband got the swiss and mushroom burger, which I tried, and it was better than what I got. My dad liked his clam chowder.

Service was ok. Server messed up the order and had to be reminded to bring out a side dish. Maybe she was having an off day.

All in all, it was a fun experience. I'd probably go back to bring a friend who wanted to see old Vegas, and wasn't a food snob."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant & I gotta say it is good!  Had chorizo & eggs plate & my bf had  eggs over easy dish, they were both good, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Come here for the food and come here for the people watching! You will not be disappointed.  If you're looking for a piece of old Vegas, this is your place. 
The decor is loud and over the top. The food is yummy.  The service is good.  A pretty good place to get your drink on with your breakfast."}
{"text":"Pepperdine cafe
A little pricy, portion size are pretty large, you can easily share with friends, Get an omelet they kill like a whole carton for that shit!

Ordered

Buffalo Wings 8.95?
Chicken Soup 4:95:
Steak and Eggs 17.99?

Fed 4 people

Should have ordered omelets lots of food haha 

They took a picture, it was hecka small.

Could have been better. 

This place is popular cause of the decorations"}
{"text":"If you like diner food and large portions, this is your spot, the food is good, no nonsense, fresh, straight-up what you are craving. The portions are crazy gigantic and the service was surprisingly good considering how busy and hectic this place is. 

Kudos to the management for putting out consistently good food with a smile!"}
{"text":"Love thissssss place!! Huge portioned meals so one could feed two people. The food is so good and the atmosphere is awesome. The only thing I had a small issue with is I had probably 4 different servers and didn't really know who to ask for help. However the place is so busy maybe that's how they keep up with the crowd. My fiancé and I made the mistake of ordering two separate plates for breakfast and shared both but it was good and next time we'll know better than to order two plates!"}
{"text":"Goodness the portions are large here. We all made the mistake of ordering our own entrees and that was the biggest mistake, especially because we weren't staying at a hotel with a fridge. I had the marco pollo omelet and that was 3 portions for me. I only ate a third of it, took my leftovers to the hotel room, and basically threw it out because I didn't trust the makeshift ice chest my friends made lol. The flavor was alright, pretty standard diner breakfast food. I really liked the crispy hashbrowns though. I enjoyed the atmosphere and decor (really kitchsy) and service was good."}
{"text":"It's time for a nightcap before parting ways. Fireside is suggested. Indoor firepit?? Check. Cozy lounge? Check. Food and dranks! Check and check! 
Seriously, I've always heard of the Peppermill but I had no idea what it was exactly. This spot. the Fireside lounge is located within the Peppermill and it is SAWEEEEEEET!! I think it's my new favorite spot! I LOVED the little love seats surrounding the firepit and how CHILL it was. It's 24 hours so I hear it gets crazy later on but it was a Monday night when I was there, about 11pmish. We ordered ribs and a quesadilla, I had a Dreamcicle too which was DELICIOUS! i'm not a rib fan but HE is and he LOVED the ribs. I thought the quesadilla was pretty tastey even though it had issues staying together. Whatever. 
This spot is super cooooooooooooool. Can't wait to go back! 


P.S. They have regular and reverse HH daily."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I loved the fact that there are glammed out cocktail waitresses taking drink orders at 9AM on Sundays. I loved the pink and purple neon and the half moon booths.  I loved the biscuts and gravy, and my three scrambled eggs... extra cheese.  For the health concious, my friend ordered a yogurt and fruit nut thing that looked like it might be good for you. 

If you are in Vegas you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Peppermill....food is off the chain!...can't wait till August for my annual ten day stay...my first stop from the airport is the Peppermill for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Always great breakfast options. lots of food for the value and the waitstaff is usually on point as well. all in all a great 24 hour diner that hasnt disapointed in early am..."}
{"text":"The Peppermill has a wonderful atmosphere reminiscent of the glitz and glamour of old school Las Vegas. The food is tasty and sized to epic proportions. It's a shame the service is slow and our waitress was grouchy."}
{"text":"this is probably my favorite diner type restaurant in the entire world. It is so much fun, the food is fantastic, and it is open 24 hours.  it is also retro in a really good way.  The Cobb salad and breakfast food are my favorite."}
{"text":"The drinks were good and the food was your simple America cuisine. I wouldnt say it was average but it could have been better. In all I cant complain filled me up service was great and it was busy but what do you expect on a weekend in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was a bit more than we wanted to pay but well worth it. Honestly I would buy one omelet and split it next time .... Plenty for 2. Muffins were fluffy. Everything was elicits with HUGE PORTIONS. We waited 20 minutes but once in service was fast and friendly. Only Pepsi products. Maserati and Mediterranean omelets excellent.  Free picture nix but they get you with the bigger one (optional)"}
{"text":"This is our first time at this restaurant, and right from the beginning the staff was unfriendly. The manager was really rude to us, it was our friend's birthday and they did not try to give any accommodation or even just good service.  The worst part was that our friend accidentally spilled the pepper grinds in her pasta. The manager seemed irritated and said he can replaced the pasta. As we get back to our hotel we noticed that they left a side of pepper, but it was the pepper grinds. This place is very disrespectful and rude and it wasn't like we didn't pay for our food. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. Service was average, bartender lady was rude."}
{"text":"I first found out about the Peppermill in Las Vegas when a friend took me there late at night for a snack.  I knew from the minute I walked in the door that I liked this place!  Funky decor, neon lighting, big fake trees throughout the restaurant, and the wonderful Fireside Lounge.  This has got to be the best diner in Las Vegas, and the setting is unforgettable.

In the lounge, the video poker machines at the bar are fun, but the seats around the water feature and fire are the best!  Last time I was in, I saw Brooke (Punkin) from Charm School.  She was having fun with some guys and kept getting approached by fans.  We left her alone.

The food is very good, as far as fried stuff and diner food is concerned.  Don't expect a healthy meal here.  The service is quick and friendly and the price is fair.  If you like the Peppermill in Vegas, the good news is that they have an entire casino and resort in Reno under the same name that takes the crazy design to a completely different level."}
{"text":"Many hotel cafe's either close early or food is poor quaity. Peppermill prices are on par with most cafes in the area and they give you a load of food! For late night dining this place fits the bill."}
{"text":"The Riviera next door, alas, is now a part of fading Old Vegas history. You mostly have to go to Fremont Street to get that kind of vibe.  But the good news is that the Peppermill is still here, still standing and still going strong as it has been since (GASP!) the Seventies! From our first visit there to our most recent, THIS is where we bring out-of-town friends and family, who want to experience some of that \"back-in-the-day Vegas kitsch.\"

Best explanation I've heard given to describe this place is that \"it's like having dinner inside of a giant disco glitter ball\", and for the most part, that is fairly accurate. The purple-and-pink neon, the shimmery walls, and the over-the-top bar/lounge is one place you've got to see to believe!

The food isn't terrible, but not as great as the ambiance.  And the menu is HUUUUGE, much like many of the portions. I'd be shocked if anyone could go through that WAR AND PEACE-sized list and declare, \"I can't find anything I like.\" Be prepared NOT to hear that, but know that if you're not into Texas-sized servings, you WILL be taking home a doggie bag. 

When you ride The Deuce, the city bus that carries everyone back and forth around the Strip, Peppermill is considered to be one of the main stops.  One visit, and you'll know why.  Here's to another dozen decades or so for this one-of-a-kind eatery."}
{"text":"This place.... Was super annoyed by the 1 hour wait to get in . Turns out it was worth every minute . I had the Sin city BLT, By far the best BLT iv ever had. Loaded with bacon and Buttery toast.! Even my boyfriend was hangry and left very happy . The fries are perfection! I would recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"I have been to the restaurant twice.  Once for late night dessert and once for late night breakfast.  Portions are ridiculously huge, and the prices reflect that somewhat.  The food is decent, but nothing really special.  I recall my spinach and cheese omlette being pretty good though I could barely make it though half of it due to it's enormousness.

And as is the usual story in Las Vegas, there isn't much here by way of vegetarian options.  They offer a veggie burger and a salad or two and of course breakfast food.

This trip I was determined to check out the Fireside Lounge.  And I'm glad we did.  We took a seat on the cooshy couches surrounding the fire and ordered some appetizers.  It was a Sunday night and kind of quiet which was fine by us.  The neon, the decor, the fire.  So wonderfully cheesy.  I loved it.  

They have a few small flat screen TVs affixed above the fire pit and they play music videos and live concerts which can provide some laughs, depending on your taste in music.

I am glad I finally checked out the lounge as I read rumors that the Peppermill may be closing with no plan to relocate.  Which would be a total bummer.  But perhaps they should move it downtown.  It would fit in well there."}
{"text":"Props to my man Paul J... his review says it all:

\"Absolute magic. 

The Fireside Lounge transforms a person. Sitting there drinking Jack Daniels while eating plate after plate of ribs served by beautiful women in long evening/nightgowns all the while surrounded by fire and water and live concert videos, this is why America is, and will continue to be, the greatest country on earth!

There is simply nothing wrong with this place and everything right about it. if I could give it 10 stars I would, in fact, fuck it, I am. 10 stars.\""}
{"text":"***This review is for the Fireside lounge only.

Sorry, but this just wasn't our thing.  Came here on our last night in Vegas for drinks early in the evening.  A couple other tables of people in the lounge, but the place was mostly empty.  I get the novelty of the place but we just weren't feeling it and it almost put us to sleep sitting on the big comfy couches in a quiet place.  Had one drink which was OK and then headed for the exit."}
{"text":"Stars for decor, good food, reasonable prices, nice waitresses.. 
I had a pretty nice experience - it was our New Year's choice :)
I've heard salutes from all hotels all over Vegas - came out to see and shout with everybody for a while. Later came back and continued our party :) 
Appreciated food and alcohol beverages. First was fresh, professionally made, big portions, delicious! Second - lil bit overpriced, but it's New Year's night - who's not trying to make money, right? :)"}
{"text":"Decent food. You can't really screw up eggs. Ever since DuParr's closed it's been hard to find anything remotely close to that experience. The only recommendation I'd give you based on numerous mistakes I've made...share a plate. If you get your own you'll be sorry. The dishes are so huge it's really partially revolting."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are massive! The two of us shared a rack of ribs for $22 with fries and salad. The meat fell off the bone and was really tender."}
{"text":"Loved this place who doesn't want to have breakfast in a place that looks like this?

Had too much the night before? This is the place to go just put your shades on you'll feel like your back at the nightclub!

I got the french toast noone can mess up french toast!

I'll be back here just to look at it again!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth trying. There is nothing exceptional about this place, but I don't have any cons. 

The prices were what you'd expect for something on the strip. The portion size is worth what you pay, though. 

The atmosphere is typical Las Vegas. A lot of neon lighting and mirrors. Very \"glamorous\" motif as you would expect for Vegas. 

The waitress was very friendly and attentive.

Overall, it was a good experience! I enjoyed my night out!"}
{"text":"I have not been to the Peppermill since before yelp was on the internet and every time I did go it was after a long night partying or out drinking where to be honest anything tastes good.
Not so now, I had buddies of mine coming into town Friday morning and of course they could not check in to the hotel because it was too early and they were both starving for some food.
I wanted to stay on the strip and suddenly the Peppermill came into my mind, I know they are open 24/7 and they serve breakfast.
So upon arrival (it was around 10am) we rolled up to the Pepermill and were greeted with a 30 min wait time and the reception area was packed with people waiting.  
Then I remembered the lounge out back that serves some of the best Bloody Mary's I can remember having, so off we went to spend our wait time in the lounge.  man I'm glad I did, it was exactly like I remembered it pink and purple neon everywhere and the small water fire pit in the middle....Classic.
Our waitress came and took out orders quickly and then returned with them just as fast, the Bloody Mary was exactly like I remembered them and you get at plethora of choices for your vodka, anyway we had two drinks each while we waited and was then called to our table.
Our waitress gave us ample time to look and order from the menu which I was surprised at seeing as the place was packed, I was  expecting her to rush us and get us out of there.
the portions are HUGE! and can easily be shared, I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs, there must have been a pound of corned beef with a crispy crust and three, yes three fried eggs on top.   
Mmmmm The corned beef was crispy on the outside but once you cut into it, it was moist and creamy then once you cut open one of the eggs and the yolk mixes into the corned beef I was in heaven.
I wish it was closer to my house so I could go more often but for anyone on the strip and bear in mind the Peppermill is located quite far down the north of the strip across from Circus Circus and the old Riviera it is still a must go to for a great meal ANYTIME of the day or night."}
{"text":"The Peppermill rocked!! I went there in December for my birthday after watching a new Frank Sinatra show at the Encore. It was only a few blocks walk through the back streets of Vegas. (By that I mean off the strip, for all us tourist folk)  I have been wanting to go there for a while now, and it did not disappoint.
The decor was dark with neon light accents everywhere. Mostly of the blue and pink variety. The bartenders were up there in age, so they knew how to entertain and keep conversation going. I forget the bartenders name that was serving my girlfriend and I, but he was a good time. 
My girl and I ended up finding an open spot at the indoor fire pit so we lounged there for a while. It was interesting... Great for people watching and you get one eclectic crowd walking in and out of there. All sort of race, creed, gender and class. It is now a must go to every time I head to Vegas.
If you are the clubbing/ bar hopping type, its the perfect place to sit with the guys and plan your strategy over some good food and a few drinks. On the other hand, its a great place to just sit after a long night/ morning and well, lounge."}
{"text":"Always solid good old school Vegas.milkshakes are some of the best in town"}
{"text":"I stop by this restaurant every time I am in Las Vegas, it would ruin my trip not to take a meal @ the Peppermill. The portions are huge and the service is great. The atmosphere is great as well, down to earth, very old-school kitschy Vegas type atmosphere, which I thought was fun.  It's the perfect place to hang out with friends after you're done doing whatever it is you do in Vegas, shopping, clubbing, walking the strip and touring casinos, whatever, this is a place to go to wind down. I personally have not been at night, although I would love to do so, this review is based on my experience going in for breakfast. (based on trip taken August 2008)

Pros: atmoshere, service, food portions and price
Cons: waitress uniforms"}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. Ate here late one night with my mom while we were visiting Vegas for her birthday. I had chicken soup and a BLT and I wish I had been hungrier because the sandwich was awesome. The soup was only okay, but the service was fine and the prices are good.

I also tried a drink called the Ultimate Mudslide and it was fantastic. Highly recommended. It was like an alcoholic milkshake."}
{"text":"Any place that been in biz 45 years and going strong is good in my book! Thats a feat by itself in the resto biz! Its 24 hours as well so better yet! Huge menu of options, with breakfast available all day! Kudos! Portions are huge, quality is good and prices are reasonable. Service is fantastic even in a busy and fast paced place as this is around dinner time. Unique and positive vibe at this place. Part diner, club, speakeasy and lounge all in one is how I put it. Love the nostalgic feel it has with counter seating and retro lighting. Even the server girls all decked out in blue skirt aprons. These girls can hustle let me say that! Always on the move!

Club sando I got was amazing. Added ham, avocado and extra bacon. Came on toasted sourdough by request. Huge, delicious and filling! Sweet fry upgrade for a buck and worth it! Sweet fries rule! 

Carrot cake is my one and only top cake of choice. Im a nazi with judging carrot cake quality! Theirs is good yes. Not $7 good but its a nice sweet ending to a good meal."}
{"text":"Eating at the Peppermill has become a tradition for us every time we're in town. Open 24/7, it exemplifies the glitz and glamour of the old Vegas--garish and all. With everything from the neon lights to the boldly colorful booths and the fluorescent table sugar, this place will make you feel like you've arrived in the city and gone back in time.

Not to mention, it's also one of the best deals on the Strip. For $13.50 you get a lot of food. I'm partial to the omelets, which are huge and come with a hefty portion of hash browns and toast/muffins. My two favorites are the Maserati and the Marco Pollo. 

The hash browns are thicker than any I've ever had. It actually feels like I'm eating pure potatoes--not overly buttered ones.

This place has the classic diner feel, but better food and heartier portions. It's pretty packed, even in the graveyard hours. And every once in awhile you'll catch a famous face sitting at one of the booths.

I definitely recommend the Peppermill for anyone who wants to get that iconic Vegas feel when coming into town."}
{"text":"We've been told \"You have to eat at the Peppermill!\" So we finally did. Seemed pretty legendary and who doesn't love diner food?

During our 30min wait we hung out at the Fireside Lounge. Man that place is awesome - I felt like I was signed up for a lapdance w/all that fluorescent lighting, fake plants, plush seating and scantily clad waitresses.

We were finally seated amongst all the hungover frat guys and huge families who took over the place. Our waitress was very nice but the overall service was sloooooow. Our food finally came and we devoured our bacon, sausage, eggs, toast, english muffin and hashbrowns. I was almost angry at how good it was and how it was going to end soon if I kept eating. We got out of the place after about 2hrs - an amount of time unheard of from us, again I'm blaming how busy the place was and slow service.

Anyway, the Peppermill was a great place for taking your time, eating yummy diner food, people-watching and chilling - all without having to inhale cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"Good for comfort food and drinks.. mud slides late night are a tradition for visiting guests. I tried to go healthy and have salmon, it was ok. I'd recommend ordering breakfast food, i've always been happy with omelets."}
{"text":"This place is awesome just for the decor. Sure, it's cheesy and dated but honestly, after all the ostentatious marble and gilt-covered surfaces of places like the Bellagio and Caesar's, it's a nice change. It's dark and funky and relatively quiet after being in noisy casinos all day. We came here for a late night snack so I can't comment on the full dinner experience but what I had was good (not great, but good) and hit the spot. Our waitress was attentive but not overly so and kept the refills coming in a timely fashion.

It wasn't too busy the night we stopped in and we almost had the place to ourselves which makes me think we may have missed out on the full Peppermill experience. Ah well, there are plenty of other opportunities to run into crazy people while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tickety Tacky in only the best way possible.  I actually really like this place.  The neon lights reminds me of my mothers make up in the 90's.

Nick the waiter was a sweetheart.  I am ridiculous in my requests sometimes, but he managed to cater to all of them.

The portions are huge!   My steak and spinach salad was delicious!  The steak was tender and medium rare just as I requested.  I asked for candied walnuts in it and Nick brought me a bowl of them!  That's what I call service.

Late night eats in Vegas!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome huge portions fair prices and everything we had tasted great not to mention the cocktail waitresses are smoking hot"}
{"text":"We were hanging out at the Artsian after hours club and the bouncer recommended we eat at the Peppermill. We step in and the decor is wild! Purple neon lights wrapping around the diner with fake cherry blossom trees in the middle. Another great thing is the portions are huuuuuuge. If you've been drinking all night and are famished come to the Peppermill. It will give you the energy to go out again and get drunk all over again. Hopefully you don't throw up though. I ordered the steak and eggs and it was great! Highly recommend you come at least once when you visit Vegas."}
{"text":"First time at Peppermill it was fun and delicious. Please be aware, Food portions are huge. We went for dinner around 9ish wasn't busy.  Our server was nice but seem overwhelmed. As we got to her know her more, we found out that she was switched from graveyard tonight. Which meant it was busier than normal. 

Overall our experience was great and will Definitely visit peppermill again next time in Vegas"}
{"text":"This is a great spot. It's worth the wait and if you have a large group, expect to wait. If you have a large appetite, this is the place for you. 

Now, although this was a breakfast place, how do they have a bar right inside? Of course, this is where I wanted to go, but we had kids with us...can I just move to Vegas? Pancakes and cocktails hasn't really ever been anything I'd thought of (outside of mimosas), but they offered, I bit...that's all she wrote. 

The pancakes are ridiculously huge if you order the pancake platter. Luckily, I ordered a meal and got smaller pancakes that would still take a greedy girl like me two sittings. This will definitely be my go to breakfast spot whenever I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"This visit to The Peppermill was about a year in the making as an out of town friend had given it 2 thumbs up & suggested we meet there. So I had alot of time to review the extensive menu which covers pretty much the full gamet of what you'd find at a Dennys (Breakfast, Sandwhiches, steaks, fish, burgers, deserts & Full Bar) but more Upscale.

I had also viewed several Youtube videos, one which featured the Mammoth \"SCORPION\" Cocktail ($20) & that pretty much sealed the deal on what I was going to have to drink. The Scorpion came just as it was shown on the vid and was very good wt no hint of any liquor at all which was strange because if you look up the recipe its loaded with alcohol. I am a vodka drinker and I'm guessing it was the 151 in the mix that had me done drinking anything else & sweating bullets towards the end of the visit. It packs a punch.

The Bartender in the Fireside Lounge was very freindly & had a good sense of humor especially when I pretended to have poked my eye out on the long straw that came with the drink and demanded someone call Personal Injury Attorney Glenn Lerner. The Bartender immediatly offered up some scissors to cut the straws to a shorter more manageable length.My accomplice had a glass of White wine ($9.50).

After conversation over our drinks and very hungry, we went into the main dining room and were immediatly seated in a nice out of the way booth in the back that was big enough for a group of 4 so we had pleanty of room to spread out and make ourselves comfortable.

I ordered the 1/2 order of Nachos wt Chicken ($16) and my Partner in Crime had a salad, Shrimp, and steamed green beans ($20) which looked very good and she had no complaints. The Nachos on the other hand were somewhat of a dissappointment. I have definatly had better. The quantity was overwhelming & in fact wt my huge cocktail, could not finish them. My complaint was they had been covered wt white cheese & baked in the oven and the end result was a concrete textured layer covering them. Also there was very little sign of any chicken whatsoever, though we did find a few small pcs upon a close inspection.

 The Nacho's were served wt 2 small cups of sour cream, a chedder cheese sauce & salsa all on the side and was pretty sparse on the other ingredients advertised - tomatoes, blk olives, jalepenos & onions. My expectations were more of a zesty, loose array of all advertised ingredients as I am accustomed  Sort of like a Taco Salad, where one can build each chip as an individual h'orderve. The concrete texture, as well as the limited ingredients, prevented this. Still it was good, but I wouldnt order it again.

The waitress, overall atmospere & company was very nice and based on my experience I would have no problem going back, or reccommending it to others. Go to youtube and see the various vids there. The breakfast dishes look very good as do the burgers. 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"If this place doesn't make you think of the swank, bygone days of Vegas where the Rat Pack and the Mob ran the town, nothing will. The interior is romantically dark, but with low, florescent lighting spanning throughout. The mirrors on the walls and ceiling really make you want to rent a kinky hotel room and get it on. The foliage that envelopes the interior adds a lovely exotic touch. The \"tables\" are actually large, low to the ground coffee tables, surrounded by big, squishy couches pushed back against a wall, so everyone gets their own, private grotto. Shall I even begin to talk about the bubbling blue flame pool that you can sit around? Awesome!! 

And let us not forget the drink menu. Typical bars and lounges in Vegas will serve up trendy, funny named drinks where, you have no idea what's in it, but with a name like \"Mouthfuck\", you just HAVE to drink it. Not so at the Fireside. Not only are the cocktails reasonably priced and STRONG, but they're the CLASSIC drinks that you would expect in Vegas. Not only did I recognize all of the drinks on the menu, but there were some drinks that are so classic and vintage that no one my age (25) has ever had them, so they're sort of trendy again. I had my very first Old Fashioned, and then followed that up with my first (of many) Champagne Cocktail. Honestly, Champagne Cocktail is where it's at!!

Then of course is the music. True to old Vegas style, they play Dean, Frank, Sammy, Bing, etc. And then, to appease their younger generation, they play Beyonce, Justin, and whoever else is popular these days. However, the song selection and sound level is hardly offensive; indeed, it's quite mellow and chill, thereby allowing you to suckle upon your champagne cocktail, or other drink of choice, and engage in verbal and social intercourse which might then, if you are lucky, lead to other kinds of intercourse. Really.. this place is friggin awesome.

BTW: The pic above is NOT the lounge... it's the adjacent restaurant"}
{"text":"The vibe is cool and retro and the food is consistently good.  If you wander into the lounge make certain to get a seat by the fire,  Just don't try to walk 360 degrees around the fire pit....it has a mirror half way around :) Cheers!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I had a late night craving for steak and we have heard good things about this place so we decided to come. We ordered to steaks and sadly they were not the best ones I've had in my life. Find even finish. The pairings were a bit off as well. I wanted mashed potatoes but the server said they were out so I decided to get fries instead. They were alright. The steak was also paired with mushrooms which were just alright nothing special. The portions are huge. I give them that. But besides that I was left sad and unsatisfied. Maybe this place is better for diner type food. If we do come next time I'll make sure to order breakfast style type of food. However as far as the steaks go I would save my money (because prices for Steaks here aren't cheap either) and go to another restaurant that has better tasking meat. 
In the plus side the staff is friendly and the device is pretty quick."}
{"text":"You walk in expecting strippers but there aren't any! Food was okay, nothing to really brag about. LARGE LARGE portions, couldn't finish it. Everyone was happy, and loved the different color sugar shaker. Was this place once a strip club? Remove the tables and you can have private booth dancers...?"}
{"text":"You've seen the Peppermill in countless films courtesy of its outrageous throwback decor, most notably Scorsese's Casino starring Robert De Niro and Sharon Stone, and apparently De Niro kept coming back here long after filming wrapped. It is a Vegas must, open 24 hours and known for its large kitschy drinks and breakfast items. I lived in Las Vegas in 1998 when they were still building the Bellagio, and the Strip looked very different. I remember well coming out of the lounge side of the Peppermill, having eaten their Ambrosia French Toast or their pancakes, and seeing the retired strippers in their therapeutic tennis shoes and their car wash skirts with suspenders running pots of coffee around the restaurant side while the counter was lined with pilots in their uniforms. The restaurant gets busy now, but it has always been popular, and I visit when I can."}
{"text":"Now you're in Vegas, having a great time, partying, taken in the sights, and shows etc... This place is to chill when you want to get away from the craziness of the Strip... This is also a place to take your date and chill with a drink after doing the shopping at the mall... The fireside lounge was quite nice... Drinks were resonable (hell you're in Vegas) 

We went back there the next morning for breakfast, even though there was a waiting time to eat, the food was not bad at all.. In fact, when you order a mimosa... You get a giant glass of mimosa!! :)

And again, the intimate atmosphere in the fireside lounge was absolutly perfect.. I mean you can actually have a real one on one date, share your favorite drink togehter, and actually tell yourself \"thank god I got away to Vegas\"  :)

I can HIGHLY recommend this place... A place to chill and relax from the craziness Vegas has to offer... Which is not a bad thing, but we all do need to recharge the batteries before going back onto the Strip!!  :)"}
{"text":"The husband and I were prepared to have a long wait due to us going on a Saturday and it  being New Years Eve weekend. We arrived a little after 6pm and were seated immediately. 

Upon being seated, we were immediately asked what our drink order would be. We decided on the Scorpion (64 ounces of their specialty drink which includes Grenadine, Rum, and Brandy). We were quite buzzed once our food arrived *insert thumbs up emoji*

The portion sizes are surprisingly large. Between the two of us, we had the Marco Pollo omelet (chicken, spinach, lots of garlic and cheese) with potatoes and a blueberry muffin on the side, and the chicken nachos. We tackled as much as we could but both ended up with full to go boxes. We had prompt service and our food was prepared and served with lightning speed. 

After dinner, we wandered over to the Fireside lounge. There were a few people scattered about, but we still snagged a prime seating area next to the indoor fire. We finished out Scorpion drink there (yeah, we kinda nursed that luscious 64 ounces), hung out and people watched. This place attracts crowds of all types, and feels retro glam Vegas-slash-old strip club lounge-slash-breakfast dinner. My kinda place."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cosy lounge.  The food was really good.  I had the Hot pastrami deli-style which was very lean. My lady had the Philly Cheese steak and we shared a Creme Brulee."}
{"text":"The only thing holding me back from a 5 star rating is they don't make their own cornbeef hash! I don't care for it but all of my friends and family do, and they had to ask ahead of time. In fact it does come out of a can! Now me personally I think its gross either way, so I don't care!!

First off....know that this place will be packed pretty much anytime from 9am to 11am so if you're going for breakfast be prepared to wait! While you are waiting you can go sit in the lounge and have one of their signature cocktails or appetizers. These might just fill you up so don't indulge too much because you will still want to have the breakfast as well.

I know they serve lunch and dinner, but this is a breakfast only kind of place to me so I am basing my review as such! 

Hits: waffles, steak and eggs, chicken fried steak, eggs benedict 

Misses: corned beef and hash, fried selections (appetizer stuff), mixed fruit 

I hate sharing this place because I know it will just become more popular and in turn busier, but I can't help it!! This place is awesome and I hope they are around for another 40 years!!"}
{"text":"Heard the great reviews so had to check out for myself. Interesting neon lights, stripper club theme my fav! No but in all seriousness, this place has amazing burgers and fries. My husband ordered sliders and curly fries. We shared some apps (caprese and shrimp cocktail). The cheese on the caprese is not great quality, would skip if I were you. The shrimp cocktail was good. Service was somewhat confusing, 3 different servers.. other than that a cool spot to get some diner food. I would come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very appealing atmosphere, and a pretty decent menu. It's open all night which was very convenient for us tourists looking to eat something late at night. It did seem they could use some help with having more waitresses. Ours seemed to be waiting to many tables"}
{"text":"This review is about Fireside Lounge, NOT the Peppermill restaurant.

The staff: Our waitress was friendly.  It seemed like we bothered her a bit at first because we kept moving around, but she warmed up to us in the end.  One of my friends knew the manager so she came by and helped us out too.  We didn't wait too long for anything, and we had an endless supply of beer nuts.  Everyone seemed pretty chill.  No need to impress or go above and beyond; just very casual and relaxed.  All the waitresses wore long \"gowns-could-be-a-homecoming-dress\".  I thought it was a nice touch.  I mean, why not right?

The goods:  I'm not a heavy drinker, I just had a couple beers.  There was a complaint that the beers weren't cold so the manager put some on ice for us before she brought them out.  I had a sip of my friend's margarita on the rocks and that was pretty tasty.  Another friend ordered nachos.  They weren't bad.  It was really dark, but I'm almost positive there was mozzarella cheese on them.  Different, but not bad.  I don't think many people come for the food, and if you do, you'll  probably be disappointed.  

The atmosphere: This is why Fireside has a reputation.  Firepit surrounded by water, bubbled by jets.  It's like Satan's jacuzzi.  We sat in the pit for a little bit, but there were quite a few of us so we ended up moving to a different booth.  The booths are comfortable, squishy, and I liked the throw pillows.  Lots of \"greenery\", helps make some of the booths more private.  I requested that we stay in a booth that was somewhat well lit and very public, Lord knows what happens in those private booths.  This is a pretty cool place, not pretentious at all.  We ended up swapping stories of previous visits to Fireside.  If you're skittish or conservative, I would recommend coming early in the evening or not at all.  This place gets pretty diverting in the late hours.  The pimps and their girls will come in and have their cocktails, and if you're lucky, there'll be a mild drug exchange going on in a booth next to you.  A lot of the transvestites frequent this joint too...I think because the lighting is almost nonexistent (jk).  They're really friendly, so be prepared to converse with strangers.  Every now and again some famous someone or other will drop in too.  Again, probably because of the lack of lighting, so they can enjoy some privacy.  There are TVs everywhere and we enjoyed the old-school to not so old-school music they played.  The Beach Boys are getting ollllllllllld, but still so lovable.  I think this is a place for an older crowd, but a fresh pup with an open mind could probably really enjoy it.

We went for my going away party and I'm not disappointed.  We had a good time and we didn't bother anyone with our volume.  I would recommend this place for a casual get-together, but not if you're looking for a sit down dinner.  If you just want a place to chill, relax and shoot the shit, Fireside Lounge is a good spot.  Just be aware of your location and understand that anything can happen.  I mean seriously, it's Vegas."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. it was First suggested by my cousin to my family 2 years ago and I suggested it to my boyfriends family this past weekend while we attended EDC. We ate breakfast here every morning and they loved it. Huge servings and great tasting food. 

Tip: Mammoth pancakes are actually mammoth. HUGE"}
{"text":"I first tried this place after leaving the club drunk and hungry I asked my cab driver what was a really good place for us to go and eat and based on his recommendation we ended up here. 

 I had seen this place many times before when in vegas and I decided to give it a try. The ambiance of this restaurant is actually pretty cool the neon lights late at night make it seem really cool inside and out. The staff was very friendly and suggestive as to what type of burger I should get let's just say I wasn't disappointed all the food was really good. Moderate price range. Cab service right outside when you need it. In short, I enjoyed my experience here!"}
{"text":"Yes, another review for the Peppermill!  Aren't we excited!  

I love this place, in actuality, especially as a last stop on a night that's gone on a little too long when the weather's a little too chilly.  At about 2 AM on such a night, warming oneself at the fire pit with a gigantic plate full of nachos is pretty much an unparalleled delight.

The blue and pink neon is a little too bright, but it gives the Lounge a character no other place has.  I could do without the flat screens playing Phish and the like, but you can't win 'em all.  The drinks are a little pricey, ($7 for a well drink, $9 and up for specialties) but you ARE on the Strip and you're paying for that awesome fire pit too.  (That gas bill must be outrageous.)  The waitresses are always very polite and prompt, and their dresses make me giggle just a little bit.  (Long, black cocktail dresses look somehow out of place and perfectly comfortable there at the same time.)  The Peppermill is really the only place worth lounging at for a local on the Strip anymore, so let's keep it on the downlow and keep the tourists away, shall we?  Shhhhh!"}
{"text":"Environment: This is like an amped up diner. Complete with neon running lights lining the molding and ceilings, indoor plants, lighting and 50s inspired uniformed servers!

Food: We went for breakfast after a long night of dancing as my friends and I were starving. The breakfasts we ordered were HUGE to say the least. Really I want to review one item we particularly enjoyed. The nachos. The nachos. The nachos! Comes on 2 plates. 1: plate of chips, melted cheese, onions, jalapenos, diced tomatoes and olives. 2: tasty ground turkey, sour cream, cheesy refried beans and hot sauce! What a smart way to serve these! Every bit can have EVERYTHING! I was extremely happy and full. No one was able to finish their food.

Service: Very attentive, service with a smile, didn't come by too often (which I dislike), but noticed when we needed refills, etc... 

I would recommend this place, and I will likely return!"}
{"text":"I am a creature of habit at times. For some reason every time I come here I always get the reuben sandwich and curly fries. It just hits the spot when you want to divulge in a greasy mess. I've picked off of friends plates as well lol. Everything is pretty good. Straight up diner food but good. Next time I'll live on the edge and try something different. Maybe breakfast for dinner. OOHH WILD!"}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas, you need to visit this place just because it's quirky. One foot in the door you flashback to the 70's. Neon lighting, faux vines hanging from the ceiling and Tiffany lamps at each booth. Who came up with this concept? Entertaining. The food portions are huge and you could easily split the order. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Visit the bar once you're done with your meal. It's worth a visit. Sit by fireplace. You'll be glad you did. I had a Bloody Mary. It was damn good! The great thing about the Peppermill...it's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"One of the best diners in Vegas. Never had a bad drink or meal here. Plus the atmosphere is really inviting."}
{"text":"Waitress was extremely rude, her attitude ruined my appetite. Asked for a small cesaer salad and she brought out a Large. The Waitress needs to listen to her consumers and not assume."}
{"text":"Great food at good prices. Excellent decor, it's definitely unique. Awesome coffee for you java lovers."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are waiting for our food right now, and I couldn't wait to write this review. 

I was SO excited to visit Peppermill. It's everything I love: over the top uniforms, kitschy decor, bad music and diner food. We walked in and I was in love. We put our names in, and it was about an hour wait. That's fine, we knew it was popular. We went to the bar and had several Bloody Marys each while we waited. Thankfully our bartender was great and the Marys were alsp excellent, which was the ONLY saving grace in this entire experience. After nearly an hour and 45 minutes of waiting, I went to the podium and asked how long it would be for our party. My exact words were \"I'm sorry, I don't mean to be that person or obnoxious, but could I check on the wait for my table?\" The girls asked my name snd initially couldn't find it, but then I pointed it out at almost the top of the page; it was very easy to see because almost all the other names (a good 20) below mine were scratched out, but mine wasn't. The girls asked me what time I put my name in, I told them right after 1:15. The two hostesses looked at me horrified amd said \"it's almost 3:00!\" I told them yes, I knew, and I was very upset. Then the two girls started arguing \"well, you were putting names in,\" \"but you were the one calling!\" and then turning to me and cooing about the time and telling me it sucked how long we waited. I don't CARE. Fix. The. Problem. 

We were promptly seated at that point, but I asked to speak to a manager. At first, she was very empathetic, but then seemed to lie to my face about what the problem was. I told her what had happened and that I'd wished the girls up front had handled the situation differently (I told her I'd wished they'd just have apologized), and she said she's going to talk to them. Fine. Upon returning, she told me she was the one calling names, remembered calling us, and that she didn't know what happened because the system was messing up. Um, no? For one, the girls told me they were calling the names. Two, my name wasn't scratched off. If you'd even called it, you'd scratch it out if we hadn't come and you cancelled our party. Three, what system? It's handwritten names in a book and a speaker, and we could hear it fine in the bar. Bartender didn't hear our name called, either. So sorry, not buying that bull. She offered us apps but I was over it, I wanted to eat breakfast and leave. 

They expedited our order, and the food was fine. I wasn't expecting spectacular, since I came for the atmosphere. My boyfriend loved his omelette, though. Everyone was nice and all, and the manager comped us and apologized, even going as far as to walk out of the restaurant and wish us a good day. That (along with FINALLY eating) really helped, but still have a bit of a sore spot. We'll see what happens next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great old Vegas atmosphere.  Service was attentive.  We explored only the breakfast menu.  Large portions of food.  Marco Polo Omelette was more than I could handle in in one sitting... but tasty!  I will definitely return to try out lunch and dinner options."}
{"text":"Pretty good food! The prices were a little more than I'd like but when I saw the amount of food you get, it's pretty much 2 meals! Great scenery, awesome service. Nothing to complain about. I'd definitely recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"I don't see what the hype is about this place. Yes, their portions are huge and the decoration is very unique, but so is every other restaurant in Las Vegas.

I think I just ordered the wrong dish though. I ate the french toast collage because I wanted a combination of sweet and savery. The french toast was just okay and I did not like the sausages at all. The bacon and eggs were perfect, though. I also tasted my mom's crab egg's benedict. They were really fishy, but the holondaise sauce was delicious. Next time I will try the corned beef hash. They come highly recommended by my father."}
{"text":"The peppermill was very busy on a Friday morning so we waited in the bar until our name was called. I had a great Bloody Mary while waiting. We were then sat and the manager quickly got us our drinks. We ordered and received our breakfast my husband got a peppermill omelette I received the Joes special both delicious my only complaint is that our waitress seemed to be in a bad mood not very friendly but she was quick and assisted us quickly we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"WHY WE WENT HERE:
- my friend's bachelorette weekend in Vegas; this place was suggested to us by one of the cab drivers 
- because we were told this is a classic, the bride had everyone dress pin-up for our meal here

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):
- in Old Vegas I believe, so farther down the popular area that people frequent on the strip

THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):
- very old school diner throughout the main area; the lounge/bar area with the indoor bonfire was legit though and brought upon a different atmosphere

THE MENU:
- traditional club breakfasts
- Peppermill breakfast favorites
- breakfast sides
- Peppermill omelets
- pancakes and waffles
- appetizers
- soups and salads
- sandwiches
- burgers
- steaks
- entrees
- desserts
- beverages, fruits & cereals
- wine
- beer

WHAT I ORDERED (I can't speak for everyone because I don't recall):
- savory ribeye steak

THE TASTE:
- for the last portion of our trip I was craving steak, so the one I ordered was more than satisfactory

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
- prompt, professional"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Lots of character! Great food , big portions, excellent service. We loved Chelsea. Will go back every visit!"}
{"text":"This is your basic diner. They had a great  variety of food and good portion sure. This is one of those places you go after a long night and need something to eat.The food is average."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast and thought it was just ok. Eggs Benedict were good, not great and the biscuits and gravy were underwhelming. Not sure it's worth the wait.  Atmosphere and cocktails in the bar/lounge were really good and that's the only reason I'm giving it 3-stars."}
{"text":"Full disclosure - I have never eaten here.  But if you want to come for a good old fashioned cocktail lounge, then this is hard to beat.  Hasn't changed in 20+ years since I was last here except the old TV's are now flat screens.  The TV's are located above the bubbling water fire pit (yep, still there after all this time) but small enough to be private screens showing old music video clips.  Think MTV before it become a TV Channel.  Sorry about the lack of 5th star but they really do need to know how to make an espresso martini and not try and fudge it.  Other than that a great late night stop off for after dinner drinks."}
{"text":"An absolute Las Vegas icon...can't believe this was my first time visiting!  On the weekends the wait is long, but definitely worth it.  Put your name on the list, head to the lounge, snag a seat at the firepit and order up a Hawaiian sunrise mimosa...you can't go wrong!  After an hour plus long wait, we were seated at the old school booths (great for conversation) and I ordered the eggs benedict...with a bonus egg, nice touch!  Throwback decor, great service and hearty food to prepare for a day/night of drinking in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great service! Huge portions .. The vegetable omelette is delicious.
This place is a definitely a staple in Vegas and should be on your \"to do\" list when you come to town."}
{"text":"Frankly, I'm surprised I beat my wife to reviewing this place.

Anyway, for what it is, it's great.

What is it?  Denny's on steroids was my first thought...but it's much more than that.  It's a Vegas institution...

And it was our first stop on our trip this time out.

We were not disappointed.  The place will not leave you hungry...and the prices won't leave you broke!

I had the Philly Cheese Steak...I fully expected it to come with the thinly shaved variety of \"meat\" that adorns most Phillys...but was surprised to find big, meaty hunks of honest-to-god STEAK on this sammy...

Cooked with Peppers and Onions, and not just completely drowning in Provolone...this was actually one of the best Philly Cheese steak sandwiches I've ever had.

It may not have been even remotely authentic, but DAMN was it good.

The Onion Rings were righteous too.  A little on the greasy side...but who cares?  3 days of eating like a 5 year old were in store for us...

What's a greasy onion ring gonna do to me?

It's really a tasty, cheesy treat, that makes you want to start quoting Swingers lines.

Please, refrain from doing that...ever...again.

But it makes you WANT to.  Real bad.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good pancakes. Everything was great. Food, service and clean. Everyone was very nice and personable. The decor is a bit out dated but clean. Highly recommend for all times of the day."}
{"text":"I have been to the restaurant and the lounge side of this place. For breakfast, I'm not a huge fan. Basic breakfast food in grease and bacon that is not crispy enough for me. The restaurant side I'd actually give 3 stars because the hash browns come in a huge size but other than that a 2.

The lounge side is cooler. There's the famous fire pit that you see in pictures but there's only one with about 6 2-person sofas. The fire pit has TVs all around it that play sports and awesome 90s music videos. There are honey roasted peanuts, matches, an a clean ashtray at every sofa.Their happy hour has decent drink and appetizer deals. My friend and I got the cheese plate for $8 during happy hour. The plate came with a ton of swiss and cheddar cheese, grapes, pears, strawberries, candied walnuts, and crackers; really filling. The margaritas were $6 and the Jack and cokes were $5 during happy hour."}
{"text":"i go here often when I go to Vegas haha I dont know why but i do. Food isnt that bad and service is nice. I usually always get the same which is the bacon cheese burger."}
{"text":"You know those places you always imagine in your head, swanky, slightly tacky, and reeking of all that is the spirit of Vegas....but you can never find. Well, the Peppermill is the stuff Vegas dreams are made of. This IS Vegas. 

The decor is bright and dramatic with a blatant disregard for subtly, and yet is perfectly muted so that even the worst hang-over would be welcomed by it's glowing neon. 

We had breakfast. The omelets were huge and fluffy with plenty of toppings. The Oatmeal was well prepared with a nice helping of raisins and banana. 

My chicken fried steak, which is my go-to dining out breakfast, was absolutely spot on. One of the best I've ever had. 

All in all, I would highly recommend skipping the buffets and going to the Peppermill instead."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot here in Vegas for breakfast.. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. They have a great selection and the service is really good. The theme of the restaurant is very old school. The portions of food is large and very good.. when you're in Vegas you gotta try this spot at least once"}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service!  We walked in 7 deep ready to eat and the young hostess says ok 45 min wait, so we reply ok, than a second hosted looks at our party and states um no that will be 1 hour to 1.5 hours at least after looking us up and down. Our party is quite colorful and diverse with a few small children. I said so you don't want us here and looks at me like no and replies well if your party wasn't so big, WOW!! That is not ok."}
{"text":"I came here because of the reviews but honestly I wouldn't come again. Just wasn't my type of environment but overall the food was OK."}
{"text":"The place looks pretty cool inside. We were really excited to celebrate our occasion here because the food and drinks had such high praise. I ordered a Kiss my cucumber that, as advertised, was a bit short of a mojito. Yes please! When it arrived it was actually really gross. Gin, water, and cucumber doesn't sound like anyone's choice. Not wanting to dampen our night out I thought maybe if I add some sugar and lemon it would help but no. Brought it up and the Manager was so snotty. Read your menu, know your product before you argue with a customer. At least offer to take it off the bill.
Accepting that it's just a drink and moving on I ask for a box to take my food, which was pretty decent, the server gave me a warped to go box. 

Gotta laugh at their consistently to not give a shit about you, the customer.

Lol; high-five! You guys suck!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of The Peppermill. A big fan. I love the 50's diner look from the outside, the massive portions of virtually anything you can chow down either at a table or at the counter in the restaurant. Nachos are great, huge and perfect for that: \"it's 4am and I need food, stat\" moment; best shared with a friend or 12. Breakfast foods are equally large portions: pancake lovers rave over their stacks; many of my burger loving friends have raved about the burgers. I usually have a gynormous salad, while iceberg isn't my favorite, it is more than adequate here (I never leave without a to-go box) Love that they are open 24/7 and the kitschy decor in the diner. There can be relatively long waits during breakfast hours and at seemingly random times. Worth the wait. Also, it is easy walking distance from many spots on the Strip, so you can walk off some of those drinks/nachos. Recently walked from TI & Bellagio. 

Just the diner side would make this great to this NYer who misses a diner. But then...you walk into the Fireside Lounge and are transported into the 1970's (overheard a man telling his wife \"it looks like a den of iniquity\")  Velvet couches in the round with flat screens playing old school videos, plus the famous floating fireplace add to the unique ambience; there are even matchbooks at your tables. There are gaming spots at bar, if that's your thing. 

Drinks follow the throwback theme along with Mai Tais, Scorpions & other \"Girl Drink Drunk\" offerings (check out classic Kids in the Hall skit on You Tube, riff on Days of Wine and Roses but very Vegas) and unique dessert themed libations. There's frequently a roving photographer to present a memento of what always turns out to be a good time for local and tourists alike. 

The waitresses wear long black cocktail dresses, and do the classic \"Bunny dip\" to place coasters and serve -- reminiscent of the old Playboy Clubs -- there's a decent array of  bar food and appetizers. On my last trip in April we had Caprese Salad (very good) Shrimp Cocktail (a ok) Chicken Quesadillas (really good, very flaky but took forever to come out) and something else I didn't eat but my friend enjoyed it. Drinks are potent, service can be a tad slow, but friendly. Our water glasses were always filled, drinks refreshed and waitress did keep in touch regarding wayward item. 

The people watching alone is worth a visit. Depending on what time you are there, you'll start to see hungry clubbers, hungry/thirsty \"dancers \" and just your variety of only-in-Vegas sightings. From about 3AM on it gets really shall we say, eclectic?' 

So, I'm a fan. Always have been, always will be. It is a cool spot to chow down, get your drink on or snuggle up to your honey. Long live The Peppermill!"}
{"text":"This place has a vintage-70s-retro feel to it on the inside. It is not run down by any means. It is in tip top shape and proud of it. I visited in April 2009 during my first trip to Vegas. This was a nice place with a similar feel to the large neighborhood bar & grill chains, but more unique.
 
The menu was huge... like a bible. I think this would be a safe place for most folks... there should be something on the menu to please anyone. It just so happens I wasn't particularly pleased with my meal, but only because I took a risk on a entree I wasn't sure about. If I'm in town again, I'll definitely go back to try something else. The menu consist of 24-hr breakfast, burgers, steaks, chicken, etc."}
{"text":"It's like a Dennys on mega steroids with much better food and happier servers. It is a must go to every time I go to Vegas, no matter what time it is you can always get a great meal at a very reasonable price, yes there are some hefty wait times but well worth the wait. 
Very retro, neon and dark and thats a great thing. The lounge is a perfect place to unwind with a few tasty beverages."}
{"text":"Get the MUFFINS! They are amazing. The free picture is nice. The service could've been a little better but the food came fast and it was more than enough. I had the peppermill pancake combo and it defeated me easily. Wife got the chicken tenders and loved them too!"}
{"text":"It's all about the Fireside Lounge...you have to atleast make a stop here if you've been out until the wee hours of the morning!!! I had my 21st birthday at the Peppermill eons ago when they used to have them in the Bay Area- and this place just brought back so many memories! The food is great and the drinks are alphabetized! it's crazy! you can't go wrong- you just gotta check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour was great and cheap here! The happy hour food and drink specials were so economical and the food portions are huge. A great time to spend with friends"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place.  i went the first time by myself bc my hubby was working. walked from the Riviera where we currently where staying, first place i bumped into.  dont be deceived by the outside looks. it didnt look like much to me.  i was hungry so i just walked in to check it out.  it was PACKED.  i sat at the bar area immediately since those are first come first serve so it was nice and fast :).  the sizes are GIAGNORMEOUSSS!!!  (yes that's a word)  huge huge portions, if you share with a friend its best.  They are very friendly, great staff, great food, great work flow.  and my favorite is the sugar!!!!! ITS COLORFUL! i loved this place so much i came back the very next day with my hubby.  he loved it too.  we are coming here every time we are in vegas :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon. Restaurant was pretty busy, but the lounge was not. Stopped by to visit and catch up on some family history and was not disappointed. Definitely old Vegas, definitely an awesome experience.
Drinks were great as was the service. I'd highly recommend making this a stop for a quick drink at the very least. You won't be let down."}
{"text":"Super fresh ingredients in their entrees and really cool bar area! The food wasn't delicious, but I did get extra star for all fresh veggies, etc. not frozen like most places serve. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is definitely unique. I haven't been here in a few years and I'm glad that I decided to re-visit today. 

The diner itself is different from your ordinary food spots.  It has great lights on the inside and I get that old diner vibe with the staff wearing their uniforms.

The food is great and comes in HUGE proportions.  I ordered breakfast and recieved enough food for the entire day. 

The staff are all extremely good looking which doesn't hurt either! 

Overall it was great :)"}
{"text":"Consistently great every time we visit Vegas!  There always is a long line of people waiting to be seated at a table but we choose to bypass the line for a quick seat at the bar.
The portions are definitely large enough to split if you want to but not always necessary.  Love the yogurt parfait and the large over sized coffee!"}
{"text":"My husband loves this place but then again he'll eat anything. Me on the other hand not a fan at all! I've given this place the benefit of the doubt multiple times since my husband is such a fan. Breakfast horrible, worst breakfast sausage I've ever had, lunch beef dip the thickest au ju terrible flavor, dinner there are no words.... Waiting for a table then the wait time for your food is outrageous! I'd rather have over priced McDonalds."}
{"text":"Went here to order some late night breakfast. Can't f____g believe they charge extra to sub out cottage cheese for hash browns. I've traveled all over the country, and this is the first place I have had that does this.

When you travel a lot, it's the little things that matter. I travel a lot, and while I can afford it, it's the spirit of the charge that befuddles me."}
{"text":"Very unique decor in both the restaurant and the Fireside Lounge.  Really loungy but in a cool way.

I had the omelet.  It was so huge, I probably only finished 1/4 of it.  But it was good.  I would like to go back some time and try the drinks and some of the other menu items.  I have a feeling I might add a star after my next visit."}
{"text":"Ahhh... The Peppermill and fireside lounge.  I think the Peppermill side is a bit like a Denny's restaurant but with better decor and slightly better food. I do however highly recommend checking out the fireside lounge. They have a pretty neat setup with a full bar and gaming and comfortable lounge style seating.  They also have a firepit with sofas surrounding it.  Very relaxing and nice to take a date or friends to share a \"fishbowl\" sized drink. 21 and over on the fireside section and only appetizers.  I always like to tell my friends \"PM in the AM\" as we seem to go to the Peppermill in the early mornings."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the strangest food joints I've been to. You can wait in the 'lounge' and have a drink and a smoke by the 'water firepits'? You have to take off your hat, but that's cool.  This place was anything but classy, but ya know what...I felt comfortable as hell.

The food and bloody mary was great. The service was good. Best breakfast on the strip...HANDS DOWN!"}
{"text":"The minute you walk through the front door and see the slot machines and pink neon lights you just know that you are in for a classic Vegas experience. The Peppermill has been on the north end of the Vegas strip for over thirty years. Many a casino has come and gone in those years but the Peppermill and the adjacent Firseide Lounge has survived.  It is well known for its neon glow, its cute car hop uniformed waitresses and its huge food portions.
 You don't need to worry about the time of day because the Peppermill is open 24 hours and serves Breakfast,Lunch and Dinner anytime. This makes it a perfect late night stop or the place to cure your morning after hangover. For Simone and I, it was the hangover cure, and we arrived mid morning and were immediately seated.  After looking over the waitress, I mean menu, I decided to order the Reuben Sandwich and French Fries. Simone decided to go for the Breakfast menu and ordered a spinach, feta and tomato omelete with hash browns and a Bran Muffin. My Reuben arrived first and it was massive. In fact, it was a club sandwich with three grilled and buttery homemade slices of Rye bread. Between the first two slices of bread was a heaping mound of fresh sauerkraut with gooey melted Swiss and house made thousand island dressing. The kraut was marinated perfectly with the flavor of whole caraway seeds and was excellent as the bed for the thinly sliced pound or so of grilled pastrami which was piled high on the next layer of rye bread with more melted Swiss. This was the holy grail of sandwiches and I amazingly finished the entire thing. The fries were a little to thick cut for my taste but were still fried crisp and were a good side to my sandwich.  Simones omelet was almost equal in size to my sandwich . It was packed full of spinach , cheese and tomatoes and even had some surprise hash browns mixed in with it ( hopefully not left over on the grill from the day before). Simone was a light weight and only downed about 1/4 of her monster meal. The hash browns that came with the omelet were grated fresh and were grilled crispy on the outside and tender in the middle, just the way they should be and i gladly helped Simone finish them.  The bran muffin also had good flavor and was nice, fresh and moist.
The Peppermill is a great experience. Come hungry, because there is plenty to eat and you will want to finish it all.  A great Las Vegas landmark, it is not to be missed. 4 out of 5 for the Peppermill ****"}
{"text":"Greasy late night diner food. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day. The Reuben is good and you can get it with fries or onion rings. You can see the cooks  making your food which I like in a diner. Friendly service and if you don't want to pay the cover for the lounge area entertainment, you can eat in the restaurant for free and the drunk folks are entertainment enough. Definitely a diner worth visiting at any time of day. 

P.s.

The onion rings are breaded not beer batter."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place while walking the strip on our first morning in Vegas. Walking in, my first impression was that the place just screams 70s Vegas. Very cool. Our waitress - Jennifer - was so nice, and she let us know about the huge portion sizes (an omelette has 8-10 eggs!) and that there is no plate sharing charge. So we ordered a plate called Munch's breakfast...absolutely delicious and big enough to share, all for $13.95. Love it!!"}
{"text":"This place has been around a long time and is a must eat at when in town. This restaurant has a great lounge in it and is also a must stop. With purple and pink decor and neon lighting and couches that surround a fire pit it is a blast from the past. So very comfortable to hang out and party or have a bloddy Mary while waiting for a breakfast table. That was my strategy anyway and it works for me. 

On to breakfast. I had the seafood omelet which had baby shrimp and lump crab meat in it. It was huge and very tasty. The only complaint is that it was a bit lite on the seafood and the hashbrowns that came with it. The egg to filling ratio was a bit off as a result and noticeable. There was also a variety of muffins besides the toast if you so choose. A nice option. My wife had the the taco omelet with hashbrowns. It was also very good. My daughter had the bacon and cheese omelet which she also said was very good. If it were not for the short on fillings in my omelet and the so-so service from our waitress this place would get 5 stars on this review. However this is a solid place and I will be back next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm a local and every time I have friends in town I take them here. They all enjoy it!

When you walk in, that's the dinner area.. food is great. The happy hour menu is a steal! The wings on the happy hour menu is my favorite off the HH menu. Good deals on drinks too. 

Once you walk in if you keep walking straight past the restrooms that's the fire lounge area. It's a fun casual place to just have a drinks, food, and just chit chat! 

I'm a wine drinker so I just get the house cab. It's actually pretty good!"}
{"text":"I had heard of this place from multiple people and then saw it on an episode of Drinking Made Easy. So when my wife and I were in Vegas, we decided to check out the Fireside Lounge. 

It's a dark little bar lit mostly with Neon, there is their signature fire pit, a pool of water with fire bubbling out of it. Instead of regular tables, they have cozy little couches you sit in either next to the fire (which was a little too warm for our tastes in July) or roomy booths you can sit in. The atmosphere reminded me of a mix between a Hollywood portrayal of old school Vegas and a strip club... but not in a bad way. We both found it very comfortable and relaxing. 

The service was fantastic! We never went without drinks, the waitress would check on us even if she could see that we were still working on our drinks. She answered questions, was very personable and polite. This was some of the best service we had in Vegas.

We wanted something light for lunch so we ordered the Crab cakes. WOW these were good! They where flaky, delicious and the sauce the drizzled on top complimented the crab flavor immensely! I would highly recommend giving them a try!

We had a couple of their specialty drinks. The Blue Hawaiian, which was our favorite. It was very good, and very blue! We also had the Scorpion, which is best described as a fishbowl filled with alcohol and ice cream, it was good, but it took the two of us almost an hour to finish it and it was very filling. After we were done, we were in a little bit of misery until we could walk it off. 

One of the neatest novelty things this bar has is the drink guns. They can push one button on the gun and it will automatically pour the drink. It gives consistency to their signature drinks so no matter who makes it; it will always be the same. It's just neat to watch it in action."}
{"text":"I LOVE YOU PEPPERMILL

Once again you made me so happy to be in Vegas. Had an early AM flight and probably couldn't check in and decided to grab some breakfast.
I got the 2 eggs and turkey sausage. Scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly and it came with 4 Turkey Sausage patties. I also had them melt shredded cheddar cheese on top of the hash browns. As the side I got the blueberry muffin...it was the most amazing muffin I've ever had. They also have whipped butter, so it didn't tear the muffin or toast if you got that. My friend got the corn beef hash. She really liked it. It was a GIANT portion. It comes with basted eggs, which means sunny side up and then finished under the salamander. Its still runny though.

The cocktail girls now wear black satin dresses instead of the awesome velvet ones."}
{"text":"Huge portions at decent prices. Love the fact that Peppermill is open 24 hours. Now the prices are probably based on its location on the strip, which makes it convenient for post-club hopping.

The interior is very retro like all diners should be but it could do without all the fake plants hovering over your food. It looked like it was regularly clean but let's hope it truly is."}
{"text":"The food was actually really good (I got the nachos). Giant portions, really delicious. I'm giving this place this rating because of the service. We were actually really nice to our waitress, however, she was very disinterested in assisting us. Whenever we'd look at her she'd be a little occupied in talking w/the kitchen staff, as were other waitresses . We tried to be forgiving and thought she must have had a lot on her plate *no pun intended* but anytime we did see her, she was just hanging outThis place could be a 5 Star but I would hope they'd work on employee attitudes, attentiveness, and productivity."}
{"text":"Good stuff on the strip. Affordable and world renowned. My local friends tipped me off to this place. Breakfast was so filling that it held me over till dinner!"}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to like the Peppermill.

I mean, I LOVE Vegas. I LOVE diner food, and um yeah, I LOVE Anthony Bourdain. Three great things must equal excellence, right?

Wrong. I was so unimpressed. 

BFF and I drove into Vegas at 5am on a Thursday. So yes, we were stone cold sober, which I think was the problem. I can completely understand how, if you might have had one or nine cocktails, you would think the Peppermill was the shit. With bright neon lights, ginormous portions, and pretty quick service, it is a drinkers dream. I was charmed by the fake cherry trees and our friendly waitress.

Our food, however, was gross. I had the eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce was not hollandaise sauce, simply put. It was gray and was more like gravy. My English muffin was burnt and I didn't quite understand why I had three poached eggs. BFF had the Joe's Special, which sounded really delicious. We fought over who would order it. It was a mix of scrambled eggs, sausage, some veggies, served over potato skins, with cheese sauce. Sounds delish, but wasn't. The potato skins were just boiled potato chunks and the cheese sauce was bright orange. There was nothing real about that cheese sauce. 

For our two meals and two sodas, it was $36. Way too much for such a lackluster meal. I gotta admit, it hurt my heart a lil to know that my Anthony and so many Yelpers could be occasionally wrong."}
{"text":"Very expensive for Diner Food, but the portions were huge.  They do not recommend you to share, but it is a good idea to share.  Their deserts looked magnificent, but we did not get a chance to try because we threw out too much food that we could not eat because of the portion sizes.

Again, if you do not live in Las Vegas and your staying in a hotel, share your food with one or two people."}
{"text":"Pretty long wait (with so many similar options around town).

But their service and food are excellent.

The portions are huge too.

Everything - pancakes, chicken fried steak, hash browns is spot on.

A little pricey.

If you can stand the smoke, Ellis Island is better tasting and half the price."}
{"text":"Finally was able to try this gem in Vegas. Came here with my family Halloween weekend for dinner. It's got that OG diner feel. The place is quite big, didn't need to wait too long to be seated. The biggest positive of Peppermill are the extremely generous portion sizes. Seemed like all the orders are big enough for 2. The service here was good as well. They have such a wide variety of items it hard to decide what you want. Personally, I ordered the Maserati Omelette! The pics on yelp are as advertised. Tasted great, it says it's 3 eggs but it felt more like 4-5 eggs! The food was definitely up to par. Peppermill is a spot that many people know of or rave about so definitely give it a try. Just make sure you're hungry or definitely get ready for a to go box. It's the perfect spot for late night dining and when you have the munchies!"}
{"text":"Very good food at 5:30 in the morning!! Very good omelette's and super huge pancakes.  Open all night across the street from Circus Circus!!  All of the food ordered was very good and great for the price!!  Affordable and good!  What more can you ask for in a meal?"}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Peppermill for over 10 years and its always good everytime... when you go inside it's lit up almost like you're in a strip club! LOL!  The service is great and so is the food!  I l love thier pastrami with the curly fries!  Moderate pricing... great quality and quantity and it always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Yummo!! The best pancakes I've ever tasted! Long wait, but worth it! Decor is old school Vegas. Classic! Neon accents, plush half-circle booths, huge coffee cups, friendly staff, who are all coordinated in cute uniforms."}
{"text":"Despite a long walk from where we were staying, Peppermill was quite the epic feast with Kathleen W. and the birthday girl Ina S. + bf Alex P.

When first entering, I could hear the \"Awws\" from the girls as they noted the neon lights, blossoming trees, and ambience inside. Definitely an old-school romantic diner type feel. Got seated at a booth and had a pretty hard time choosing between their menu ranging from Southern fried steak to breakfast foods to pasta. While deciding, we got our picture taken in the booth, whcih we got to keep - cute.

Ended up ordering the following and definitely had to split up to the ginormous portions:

-Seafood omelette: Even split two-ways between Kathleen W. and I wasn't enough to finish this. Filled with shrimp and crab, we wondered how many eggs went in this breakfast monster that could easily take up room in a cake box. Hashbrowns were not as great as I would have liked, but the taste of the omelette was just how I would have wanted it, with a good amount of hollandaise and cheese

-Nachos appetizer: Mound of beans, carne, jalapeno, nachos, and real cheese that you can dip in guac and salsa - basically a heart attack ready to happen, but quite tasty while warm

-Fish n chips: Not gonna lie, these were surprisingly good. Thick slices of cod and curly fries was a total win.

-Mudslide: Delicious with real ice cream in there (much better than the pre-made stuff I usually blend). Girls said they could really taste a lot of alcohol, but I really just enjoyed it like a milkshake

Super filling meal where less than 3 dishes almost exploded our tummies with awesome. A great way to end our Vegas weekend.

*Note: Apparently if we would have told them it was our friend's b-day, we would have gotten a pretty large sundae, but we had difficulty moving ourselves afterwards, so probably a good idea that we didn't let that go to waste by telling them :P"}
{"text":"Um thank God and Jesus and Santa Maria I found this place. It isn't in the most alluring spots on the strip but that is ok. I was staying at Trump. The bar was not open at 230am. What the double F? I walked down the block to the shady part of the strip and found peppermill. This is my 3rd time in Vegas. I don't venture to this part of the strip often but im so glad i did because the drinks were cheap and everyone sitting at the bar was a service industrustry worker. 5 stars plus a trip to heaven and service industry paradise. Didn't order food but got Fri is and drank a bloody Mary amongst multiple beers at 3am"}
{"text":"Not worth the hour + wait. Food was cool, English muffin was soggy, hash browns crispy on the outside but hard and cool in the middle. SanFran Joes special lacking flavor. Had high hopes as others had raved - Denny's down the street would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"The portions are way too large but I love the ambiance. The lounge is really cool as well. I recommend sharing anything you get because it's far to much to eat for once person."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go eat. You will definitely get your money's worth. All of the food they serve you your need a personal wheelchair to leave. If you order the nachos don't do it if your by yourself. You'll need bout 5 people to help you eat it"}
{"text":"Omg!!! You better be ready to eat when tou hit this place"}
{"text":"Las Vegas best late night diner. If your looking for a great amount of food this is it, were 10 egg omelets are standard. The strawberry shortcake is a great way to top off the night, it so big you can share but I don't. Staff is fast and friendly. A late night must after the Club in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed in my Wednesday breakfast spot The Peppermill if the news is correct concerning them asking a Muslim women to remove her head wrap or leave. Funny thing is; I always were a fitted ball cap when I'm there and usually have on Sunglasses. Just watched News 13 and I will never return. Now I am a Christian and Jesus ate with everyone. I'm not returning."}
{"text":"I'm tellin you...this place used to be a strip club in its past life. It has to be!!! LOL!!! Only thing that was missing are stripper poles. You can install one at the top of every dining table! =D The neon lights...the white light above your dining table...you either love em or hate em. I personally think it's freakin awesome!!! I'm sure the decor and carpets haven't been changed since the 1980s. Any person who enjoys that \"old school\" Vegas feel...you definitely gotta come here and check it out. 

What is there left to be said that hasn't already been said in the past 1700+ reviews?

-come hungry. Portions are BIG. Maybe share a couple dishes between your party. You will not leave hungry. Small eaters like myself, I guarantee you will have leftovers for the next day. Or even the day after that.
-this place is always busy. No matter what time of the day it is. So just be prepare that there MAY be a wait.
-Located between Encore Hotel and the now shut down Riviera Hotel.

I ordered the Chicken and Red Pepper Pasta. Two big pieces of grilled chicken breast stuffed with cream cheese. Ehh....personally, I could've done it without the cream cheese inside.  Very flavorful and my dish came out pippin' hot. Boyfriend had his heart set on the Country Fried Steak dinner. He thoroughly enjoyed it! A lot! Both our dinner entrée came with your choice of soup OR salad. Soup of the day (I came on a Wednesday night) was cream of broccoli. Pretty good. I will definitely be back....perhaps around lunchtime so I can try out their sandwiches. Looks promising."}
{"text":"The Peppermill lives up to the diner hype here on Yelp.  Big portions of diner-style food are the main attraction, and a skilled group of servers deliver well prepared food with a smile.

Omelets are huge.  This ain't Denny's or IHOP.  And they're delicious, too.

Sandwiches are all huge.  The burgers are best eaten with a fork, as they are big, piled high with your choice of tasty toppings.  The Focaccia Chicken sandwich is gargantuan with juicy chicken breast, avocado, prosciutto, and melted provolone cheese.  I dare you to eat the whole thing.  

For me the star attraction at Peppermill is the Onion Rings.  I started my cooking career at Howard Johnson's decades ago, and besides being a great place to get ice cream HoJo's made a few things very well that brought customers back.  Onion rings were thickly hand-sliced then dipped in condensed milk, then battered, dipped in condensed milk a second time, then battered again before deep frying.  The results were amazing, and Peppermill's got a good process, too, as their O-Rings brought me right back to HoJo's kitchen in Maple Shade, NJ.

Prices are not cheap, though they are not casino-expensive either.  Any way you look at it, you'll find lots of yummy food, served by good people and fair prices.

If you're at the Convention Center take the walk or pay the cab fare.  Considering the food there you'll thank me later, fellow Yelper."}
{"text":"Scorpion cocktail seemed alot larger the last time I was here. The 64 oz drink didn't seem like 64 oz. And was loaded with ice. I was a little dissapointment in the drink that cost $18 but I still love the ambiance fireside. Great little romantic hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Pepper mill is a-ok because of its attentive staff, obese portion sizes, and large local gathering. The food is ok, somewhat tasty but not orgasmic (kinda like buffet food).

I had an omelette, and a chicken parm (on separate visits). Both were split between two hungry ppl and we still couldnt finish the food in front of us. The price was a bit expensive for the food quality: think of this place as an upgraded Denny's.

Oh, the food quality soars when you come here in the wee hours, for whatever reason. Lol. It's open 24 hours, so enjoy!"}
{"text":"Vegas classic, you must hit up the Fireside Lounge in the back (to the left of the entrance past the restrooms).  The neon trees and the ballgowns are epic!"}
{"text":"Great place for late night food spending my birthday in Las Vegas this was one of the go to places the food was awesome the people were fast an accurate if you are ever in Las Vegas try it out"}
{"text":"This place really has one of the best breakfasts in Vegas. Just solid food not fancy and expensive like you find on the strip. This is where the locals go to eat."}
{"text":"I love coming here drunk.

Decor is 1990's strip club... which is a plus in my book.

Food is good too. I like seing all the industry people here"}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but it decorated in retro 80s style with neon lights.  Excellent food, and service is top notch. Thanks yelp reviews for suggesting an excellent place."}
{"text":"Standard diner-type place. The decor makes it almost feel like you're in \"back to the future\". The staff are super friendly and nice, and the food is decent, normal diner fare. I ordered a grilled cheese, it was good! Friends ordered other sandwiches (BLT, Club, etc) and those were well-received also :)"}
{"text":"LOVED the Peppermill.  A friend had told me long ago that I needed to go here and I've been meaning to, but finally made it on this last trip.    SO worth it!  First of all, I think it's probably CRAZY on weekends because we were there on a Wednesday morning and there was a crowd of people... luckily only a 15 minute wait, though.  Perfect timing for us to head into the Fireside Lounge for a Bloody Mary!

The Fireside is AWESOME.  It's so 70s Vegas... all shiny and neon.  There is a big fire and water element in the middle with couches around it in a circle.  Love it.  The Bloody Mary was huge, but not so strong.  I just totally loved the atmosphere and it was nice for us because it was also pretty empty, so we had the fire pit to ourselves.

When they called our names, we were sat in a big booth and ordered our breakfast.  The husband had a French Dip and ordered the fruit as his side and WOW, it was a huge bowl of nice fruit, including a whole cut up banana, strawberries and melons.    Very nice. I was jealous.  I wanted to try a bunch of things so ended up getting scrambled eggs, hash browns and biscuits and gravy.  It was WAY too much food, so I only ate about a third of it.  The \"three eggs side\" was more like about 5 eggs.  The biscuits and gravy were good, but not great and a huge plate.  I think they should do a smaller version.  I wasn't that fond of the hash browns either.  Only the very top was crunchy and the pieces are just too big for hash browns.  But, otherwise, I enjoyed the food.  

Our server was attentive and the food came out quick.  Cost for food was about $30, but I over ordered.  We really enjoyed our meal and the whole experience.  I definitely recommend a visit to the Peppermill!"}
{"text":"It's like the Denny's of Vegas.  Live the decor.  Good was ok.  Nothing fantastic and the prices were steep.  But, if you need quiet diner food on the strip, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This was a cute atmosphere and appreciated the souvenir photo.  We were so confused by the evening gowns the cocktail waitresses wore versus the 50s dinner skirts with suspenders the servers wore but they were nice enough.  
There were no menus when we got there so we were seated without which was very odd.  Then the food was so so nothing to write home about.  Cute to stop in but I wouldn't consider your trip to Vegas ruined if you don't stop in."}
{"text":"I love this place.  We try to visit for breakfast every chance we have when we visit Vegas.
They portions are large so we normally share; but, they serve good food at a reasonable price.
We've tried many things and they have all been good."}
{"text":"Peppermill brings my imagination back to the time where Vegas was ruled by the mob and Ol' Blue Eyes made all the ladies swoon with his velvet voice. Neon Lights and plush decor followed by a tree in the middle of the dining area, only in Vegas baby!

Our first stop was this place straight from the airport. My friend went for the usual - scrambled eggs, sausage and home fries. I've never had it so I tried the southern fried steak and eggs. All I can say is that it's perfect drunk food. Filling, heavy and the steak looked like mystery meat lol. Huge portions. 

Great diner that's open 24/7. Oh and I saw Paul Pierce here."}
{"text":"I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken steak and eggs - HIGHLY recommend. 

Very crispy on the outside / juicy tender on the inside. Hashbrowns were okay for me, could have been more crispier. 

Also got the pineapple mimosa - nice twist but comes a little heftier price -$10/ glass"}
{"text":"This is a decent place to get a late night meal. The old time Vegas decor is the real selling point here. I had bacon and eggs which were good. It took awhile for us to get our food even though it wasn't that crowded. I didn't get a chance to have a drink in the lounge so my rating is for the restaurant portion only. I do plan trying both the lounge on my next trip and if it is nice as I hear, I anticipate raising my rating."}
{"text":"This place is a staple on a g Vegas trip we take. 24 hour diner with retro fireside lounge, and a classic diner menu. Breakfast served all day alongside blue plate specials, sandwiches, salads, burgers, and more!


We always go for breakfast before we leave town! Huge omelettes, pancakes, and waffles! They seem to work as a team there, and we have never had to ask for more coffee. Always someone there to give speedy refills. It does get REALLY packed, so don't be surprised if you have to wait! 

Sit in the lounge while you wait to enjoy some music and TV/sports. There is t anything there that we have ordered that we didn't like. I recommend the pancake combo; it's super easy to share. 3 huge pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs...al for $13.95!

You won't leave with an empty belly!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a throwback to wonderful times.  The Fireside Lounge is probably the best bar in all of Las Vegas and I cannot recommend it enough.  This is the real Vegas and it makes you want to get smashed every time you go (and I'm not really a drinker!)."}
{"text":"I decided I wanted to visit the Peppermill when I saw it on No Reservations. Then after reading the reviews on here I knew I absolutely had to go since I prefer places with..hmm..lets call it  \"character\".

Cheesy. Check. A little tacky. Check. Absolutely wonderful. I think so.  I made the lounge my first stop after arriving in Vegas at 2am. I was surrounded by fake plastic trees and hot pink rope lights. I sat where I could overlook the fire pit and was served by a waitress in an evening gown. She and I bonded over making fun of the guy I was with as he asked a billion questions about martinis and I, the chick, just ordered a beer. The alcohol prices, I would soon learn, are pretty much on par with most places in Vegas. They did however have pretty good booze specials that started at either 3 or 4 am ( I cant remember exactly) and ran for a couple hours. I also opted to feast on some nachos.  One order was more than enough for 2 people. Oh, and I know this may not be important to all but I was very impressed that the nachos were clearly layered. By this I mean Chips then cheese then chips then cheese etc.  Not just cheese on the very top of the chips. What can I say? Little things impress the hell out of me. In conclusion, it was a great start to my first trip to Vegas. Oh, Peppermill I will be seeing you again soon."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! If you're in Las Vegas and want to get away from the craziness to grab a bite to eat at a local diner this is the place to go. I love how it's unique and is all about the neon lights. The food is so yummy and the portions are big. 3 of my friends and I started off sharing an order or nachos and WOW! Big portion. We didn't finish it because it was so much and had forgotten all about our individual entrée. I ordered the Pesto Chicken sandwich. When I saw it I was full just by looking at it but of course I ate as much as I could and it tasted delicious. The service and vibe are great and everyone that eats there is friendly and fun. 

After dinner we went to check out the Fireside Lounge on the other side, my friend calls it the Swingers Lounge because it reminds you of something from the 70's with the dim lights, more neon lights and fire place. Different for sure.

Make sure to stop by on your next Las Vegas visit."}
{"text":"Hour hour specials make this place amazing!  Stop in to this garish but comfortable lounge for great apps and amazing drinks.  An amazingly big place to meet up with friends and have a great time.  You will have a memorable experience here."}
{"text":"WOW 
Want to time travel to a 70's diner? Here it is. Had a hamburger and onion rings. Tasted exactly as expected. Burger awesome - onion rings perfect. Some of best onion rings ever consumed. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"I am NEVER disappointed with the food and service here! Today it was the Lorraine Omelette...so good!"}
{"text":"Menu is huge,something to choose from for everyone.Portions where very big and the food was prepared very well.We liked it so much we ate there two nights in a row when we were in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you get to Vegas, You must stop in at the Peppermill. The place is an institution. Think of it as a cross between a Denny's and strip club without the naked girls. Since this place is open 24 hours a day, you see an interesting cross section of America.

Tip: Make sure to go in the back room and check out the fire pits and love seats. For guys, I recommend going between 4A-6A, the girls that work at some of hottest Vegas night time places are going home and stop in to eat before they go home."}
{"text":"in the bar waiting to hear your name for a table over boisterous karaoke, can result in missed opportunity, menu is just OK, as was food, you gotta love the resistance to change"}
{"text":"Peppermill is a fixture on Las Vegas Blvd.  Located just south of the old Rivera Hotel and Casino, it's within walking distance of the casino properties on the north end of the Strip.  I had heard about it for years and they have a website that makes the place look pretty darned cool.  I finally made it there when a relative came into town, was staying on the Strip and wanted to meet us near their hotel. It was the right time to give The Peppermill a try.

Honestly, everything was just okay.  Certainly nothing was bad or wrong, but nothing was better than average.  I was a little surprised.  We went back again several weeks later, but the experience was the same.

The waitstaff did just what waitstaffs do:  seated us, took our order, filled our drinks when they were empty (but didn't keep them from going empty), and brought us our check when we appeared to be finished.  They didn't take too long for anything and didn't rush us either.  Get in, eat, get out.  Average.

The food was average too.  This was disappointing since I had heard so much about The Peppermill before--almost all very positive.  I don't even remember what I had the first time, and I rarely forget what I order at a place the first time I'm there.  The second time I ordered the Southwestern Beef Kabobs.  They tasted fine, but were overcooked and dry as a result.  I'm pretty sure they sat under a heating lamp while the other dishes were being prepared since the vegetables were also dry.  Again, not bad, but not really great either.  I'd expect this kind of food in a roadside diner, not in a fairly well-known restaurant and arguably a feature on the Las Vegas Strip.

The atmosphere is unique but nothing special.  It's certainly a cool change from sitting in another generic restaurant, but it seems they may have once been a special place but have now forgotten they're on The Strip in the middle of a city known for an amazing assortment of all kinds of amazing restaurants and a huge variety of food.  The website make the place look very cool.  Better on the web than in person.  Once again, not bad but not great either.  Just average, and I'm not sure average can survive on The Strip these days.

Parking is super easy:  park right there in front of the restaurant.

I sincerely hope The Peppermill doesn't go the way of the old Sahara and the Riviera.  They could be something great.  (They SHOULD be something great.)  If you're on that part of Las Vegas Blvd and need a decent place to eat, it'll certainly suffice.  But with all the choices within just a few miles, I'd honestly go elsewhere.  There are too many other great restaurants to chose from.  Even though The Peppermill is okay, because they don't seem to care about where they are or what they could be, I can't give it more than two stars."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's quintessentially Vegas in a diner. 
The staff is so friendly. The food is delicious (even in a sober-state, and that's saying A LOT in Vegas). Huge portions. You definitely get what you pay for. 

They were nice enough to split our check and our waitress was amazing. She alone, deserves 5 stars. She brought me an extra order of hash-browns, when the ones I had ordered weren't crispy enough (I didn't even have to say anything!). That's attention to detail!"}
{"text":"food is huge and our waitress was super on top of things!!! We got our free photo and are ready to sleep lol btw Try the eggs Benny sub sausage instead of ham.. YUM! there breakfast sausages are really big and good!"}
{"text":"Blueberry Hill won this one.  I ordered biscuits and gravy. My biscuits were flat and crispy and my gravy had no taste. The coffee was bitter and cost $4.00!  Sorry Peppermill I won't be back. Your 2 stars were earned by our waitress"}
{"text":"Amazing food - seafood is so fresh & all the food we ordered was delicious!! Wonderful service too! A must any time of day!!"}
{"text":"This is actually one of the coolest and nicest places to eat in Vegas on the strip that won't break the bank. The Peppermill is sort of a Las Vegas landmark and staple; having been here since the 70s (It was even used in the movie Casino). The Peppermill is still all original inside with it's cool and almost Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy like futuristic lighting and funky neon colors. The staff are extremely attentive and very very nice and welcoming, the wait times aren't ever really that long and the staff does their best to seat you as fast as possible. 

The food here is absolutely amazing and ranges from your breakfast staples like pancakes (which I highly recommend) to dinner favorites like steak or wings. The prices here are also what's a huge selling point for this place as Peppermill really isn't all that pricey despite being a stones throw from the Strip. I ordered the pancakes and got 3 massive pancakes (literally the size of my head), a huge dollop of butter and syrup, 3 pieces of crispy bacon, and a soda all for only around 12 bucks.  Now I do have a small gripe about this place but it isn't enough to ever get me to stop coming. The booths and tables are a bit small so if you have a bigger group you may end up being a bit uncomfortable even in a big booth. Other than that I absolutely love Peppermill and will be returning."}
{"text":"Best salad I've had in a very long time. The Spinach Berry Grilled Chicken Salad was super delicious and very filling. The chicken was so tender and the strawberry vinaigrette was the perfect compliment. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere!  The food was very tasty and I really enjoyed my meal here after taking a break from a long day at a convention."}
{"text":"This is the best place to come after hours of drinking!  I love their food/breakfast.  Biscuits and gravy are delicious.  Portions are huge!  You will not be disappointed!  Great service!"}
{"text":"Got to finally try this quirky old style diner. The staff was very efficient and friendly. The prices are fair and the portions are HUGE! Definitely leftovers or good for sharing. They are open 24 hours a day. Nice casual feel. You'd feel comfortable in any attire there."}
{"text":"Kitschy, but in a good way.  This place has almost come full circle to being genuinely cool again.  Almost.  The food & service were decent, and prices were very un-Vegas like.  I would call the dining room & the bar a definite value.
Tip: we used The Peppermill as a taxi destination, had dinner in the dining room & drinks in the bar, then casino-hopped down to the Stratosphere, before cabbing it back to the strip.  Made for a fun evening."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, eggs cooked to perfection, no waiting to be seated or for our food.  Prices are high but its Vegas, so not unexpected."}
{"text":"Cool place to check out. Neat vibe...great drink options. HUGE portions...more than enough to share with 2 hungry people.  Ordered the nachos, chicken tenders, and the chicken fried steak and eggs. Nachos are sort of deconstructed. The beans and meat come on the side. They were a huge portion, good amount of cheese. I'd rate them 3, though. I come from a state that has good Mexican food, so they are just ok.  The chicken tenders...you get 4 and they are wide and flat. Big portion. Huge portion of fries come with it. Steak and eggs also good. It's a sausage gravy on the steak...and it's very sausage-y. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Chicken fried steak tasted pre-battered, but still good. Service was good as well. You have 3 servers...one takes your nonalcoholic order, one does alcohol only, and the other takes your food order and refills nonalcoholic bevs. Interesting place. I definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I had visited the Peppermill Casino in Reno a couple of years ago and was nearly shocked into seizures by the decor. The Peppermill Restaurant in Las Vegas didn't disappoint in that regards. The theme is equally gawdy and downright perfect. The food and coffee portions were huge and tasty. I didn't get a chance to try the Bloody Mary, but it looked delicious. And as alluded to, the people watching rates 5 stars here."}
{"text":"Having to wait 35mins for a table was well worth it!! The food and service was amazing!! I will make sure i stop here again while in town.
I am glad they had a lounge area to wait and get some drinks started while waiting to be seated! This is a for sure Las Vegas \"original\"! I am glad i finally gave it a try!"}
{"text":"Love the retro decor!   Love the fireplace and neon lights. The sliders were delicious, and the cocktail I ordered was very good.  Was hoping for more reasonable prices, but totally enjoyed the visit!"}
{"text":"The ambiance alone for this restaurant is a total win. Located near the more classic parts off the strip like Circus Circus and the late Stardust. The waitresses and cocktail waitress are dressed up in true diner style. The menu had a wide variety of food and from the things that my party ordered, all of it was delicious. The mushroom dish that came with the steak was phenomenal. 

The Peppermill also has incredibly large portions for the price you pay. If you ask for a side of fries, its in a huge bowl instead of a small plate. Although I did not drink any other their drinks they had a huge drink menu that looked great and all of them came with a scoop of real ice cream. I will have to try it the next time."}
{"text":"Fire side Bar was very cool, sorta awkward to lounge around the fire with random people, but It's not like I payed to be a VIP, LOL...
 
THE DRINKS:
     THE SCORPION: Let me just tell you, \"ITS HUGE\" it's literally a 2 gallon fish tank!! It's super yummy though she waitress said it had like 6 shots in it.
     
      KEYLIME PIE MARTINI: Taste just like pie, normal size.

FOOD:
       PASTRAMI BURGER: Well done and very tasty I paired it with onion rings. Huge servings, so I took most of it home since I ordered and finished my drink before any of the food.

        Chicken Parmesan: Okay let me just tell you, the noodles are neon orange but OMG!!! It's the best neon orange noodles I have ever tried in my life!!! It's got  little spicy kick to it and basically magic in your mouth, again the portions are huge so my husband took most of it back to our room.

Overall a great experience and will be back for sure my next time in Vegas, the prices are very standard but keep in mind the portions are huge!!! Oh and there's a guy who comes around to take your picture for free (tip the guy)"}
{"text":"Was a regular stop back in the 80's while staying at the Stardust. The food has always been awesome with exceptional service, if it sounds good to you on the menu, it will taste even better."}
{"text":"The breakfast was delicious! The ambiance is perfect for the breakfast/brunch time. The waiting is pretty long but the lounge through the double doors is perfect for waiting and having awesome large drinks! The price is very reasonable for the amount of food. The three star is for the waiting time, the 2 only bathrooms in the womens restrooms and my always hit or miss, the coffee. The coffe was terrible and yes this is Vegas and usually everyone has a drink, but I'd like a good cup of coffee once in while during my Vegas trips. Otherwise, great area, lots of parking and good service!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place for an affordable meal that won't disappoint. Don't expect too much. The place offers generous size portions at a great price. If you are looking for a fancy place this is not the place for you. And BTW the service was good"}
{"text":"this was my 2nd. time eating at the peppermill restaurant in Las vegas bad experience my waiter was not friendly at all my bacon was limpy not crispy at all they get a failing grade D minus my first time was very good next time I want a lady waitress as my server"}
{"text":"Fun place to eat,good waiter service,great spot location....specially when u are starving and have no time to waist looking for something...:)"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and u can shop at Ross next door right after where u find amazing things!!!! But yes delicious breakfast served with a minchilada at 10am!! But can get very busy so be prepared to wait besides that nice atmosphere nice waitress and good food! Just didn't get that last star because the sausage links are very big and undercooked :("}
{"text":"A Vegas must for breakfast. The atmosphere alone is worth the stop. It's like stepping into an iconic Vegas movie set.  

The service was friendly and prompt,  the omelet enormous and even the coffee mugs were oversized. We're contemplating breakfast there again but maybe splitting something would be a wise choice this time

."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, just a good place to come with friends after the festivities on the Strip in Vegas. Nice divey bar in the back of the restaurant so that you can get a quick drink while you wait. Friends and I were leaving Vegas to head back home and we decided to go to Peppermill for a quick bite. I got the Chicken Cesar salad and the best thing about the meal was the garlic bread. Also the waitress overcharged our card in which we had to dispute so be careful."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is open 24/7. A diner with neon lights and fake shrubbery decorating the interior of the room! While you wait for your seat, you can play at the slot machines or visit the fireside lounge where you can see the fireplace!

The waiters are friendly, the sugar is fun and colorful, but the food does take a while to come out. But when they do, the portions are quite large!

The New York steak and eggs was ordered at medium rare, but It came out medium. Juicy and tender enough, with pepper sprinkled on top. It comes with a choice of bread, where you can choose muffin or toast. The blueberry muffin was very moist, soft and delicious with some sugar on top.

The turkey dinner (seasonal) was actually very good. It wasn't dry at all. Came with a side of stuffing, cranberry jam, mash potatoes with gravy a dinner roll and some veggies.

We also ordered the Soup salad and bread. The chicken soup tasted fresh but the salad wasn't very fresh, some of the leafs were already starting to brown. You are given the choice of Garlic bread or Rosemary. We went with the garlic bread, and I was happy to see that it had cheese on it.

The Ciabatta pesto burger, was ordered medium but came out well done. Had it been cooked correctly it would have tasted pretty good. Ordered with a side of Onion rings which were on point!

If you're very hungry or looking for something to eat at odd hours, this restaurant will definitely satiate your appetite! But if you're searching for quality, I recommend going elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The nachos and appetizers are huge portions at the Fireside Lounge. They have nice round fire pits there to comfortably sit around and share appetizers or a meal with your family or friends."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good quality, fast friendly efficient service, large portions nice price point. 
This place is a must try....
Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"After a hard night of partying and you wake up to realize that Hang Over the movie suddenly makes sense... this is the place to come to recoup... LARGE portions of all the necessary alcohol absorbing goodness is served here.. Crazy decor in here to keep the party vibe going even at breakfast.. 

Excellent service even when the placed was slammed on a sunday morning rush. Portions are large and in charge, so bring a empty stomach. 

Come here for the feel of your home town diner with a vegas twist.. If you come here at night you can eat and drink all at the same place, yes this place has a vip lounge in the back..well Vip is what I think entering into this dark glass lined fire pitted lounge room with decor that is stuck from the days of Scarface. 

Looking for somewhere different to get some diner style food or to get away from the maddening crowds check out the lounge at Peppermill."}
{"text":"I went twice for breakfast brunch. The food is excellent and the service is even better. We ordered egg white omelet and pancakes. Both were delicious. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone.
Warning - The serving sizes are very LARGE. So order less than what you would eat normally."}
{"text":"I was super excited to visit one of my favorite restaurants. I grew up eating at the Peppermill. So many great memories and wonderful food. So I decided to have brunch here for my 30th birthday. A milestone celebration. I ordered a Mediterranean Omelet that was supposed to have crab and shrimp and cheese. The omelet came full of shrimp and cheese. I found no crab. I asked them to remake it. The waitress spoke to the manager. The manager told her no, that they would not remake my omelet. They would take it off of my check. But I was then left with a half made omelet. I highly doubt I will be returning. I don't recommend this location. What a downer."}
{"text":"This place is pricey, service is hit or miss no matter if they are busy or not, and ambience is retro disco 70's ish. They are open 24 hours which can be either really good or really bad depending on how you look at it. Food is decent. The three stars are for their large portions. If im gonna spend 10 bucks for a burger and fries or 24 bucks for a steak, it better be decent and it better be able to fill me up. 

Other than that, Denny's would be a good choice if you wanna save some money and get pretty much the same results. I wasnt too impressed my only visit here. I guess it would be one of those once in while places to eat. Definitely would not take anybody here unless they insist and are in possession of large amounts of cash."}
{"text":"The decor at this place is pretty neat! It has an old school \"fancy\" feel, great food and good service. I only gave 4 stars because one of the meals (French toast with scrambled eggs, sausage and hashbrown on the side) came out a bit cold like it was sitting for a while, but they were reallyyy, really busy (seems like they always are)! Other than food temp and the hour wait, it was good!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the restaurant part as well. The food was standard diner offerings, which was pretty good. The manager was really taking care of business, though. Unfortunately, I can't remember her name, but she was doing a great job! It was very busy that day, and there was a new host that was clearly not ready, yet. Upon seeing this, the manager quickly replaced the spot with someone with more experience, and things moved much faster. She made sure that the entire place was moving as efficiently as possible. She was also very nice to talk to. I'm sure I'll be back more than a few times now that I'm a local."}
{"text":"I love this place! We have been here every time that we have been to Vegas. It is open for 24hrs, and you can get breakfast anytime! The decor is so kitchy and kooky it is just entertaining in itself. The walls and ceilings are covered with mirrors, there is a lot of pink neon happening and there are these big fake cherry trees. They also have a great lounge complete with an indoor fire pit. Their food is typical diner fair, but amped up a bit. Unless you are really hungry and can put away some serious food, splitting an entree is probably just fine. They have got great Reubens, burgers and breakfast. My husband had the California omlette that was so big, he ate half, then we both split the other half for breakfast the next morning. They also have your basic cocktail menu, that you order from your cocktail waitress. This has become a must when we go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with an old school Vegas feel. Recognize the place from many a movie. Great portions , delicious coffee and fresh ingredients. Will definitely be back here on my next trip."}
{"text":"If your my yeep you know I seldom give 5 stars.  I absolutely love this place.  It is a Sunday stop before we leave Sin City.  Back in 2005 a buddy of mine brought me her on a birthday weekend.  It was a Sunday just before we headed back home to CA on a hot Summer July morning.  We were completely smashed from the night before and he said lets have a bloody Mary.  

OMG he came back from the fireside with these wonderfully spicy B Mary's and I was hooked.

On this morning I had the tostada omelette.  I had asked my son to share his order with me but he said no I can eat dad.  So I challenged him.  Being that I have been here several times I knew the portions were large.  So I ordered my own and told him he better eat it all.  Guess what he did! He threw back at me and said \"you better eat all of yours\".  So about half way he gave up I didn't show it but I was done too.  The waitress came by and asked him if he wanted his, he said \"no\" I was like \"what happen\"?  Waitress \" don't worry honey there's 10 eggs in there you did a good job!\" 

Jaw drop! quite in the restaurant you could hear a pin drop.  The challenge was on!  As i cut through the omelet I could see the layers of tostada, ground beef, guacamole sour cream, lettuce and cheese.  Its warm goodness got me so full so quickly.  It got hot in there too, the salsa had just enough bite.  I ate it all and rubbed the victory in my sons face and he laughed, said \"your gonna be sick!\"

Go to the Peppermill great food drinks and experiences."}
{"text":"My cousin and aunt recommended this diner for breakfast and we were not disappointed. Seemingly a bit pricey, but for the amount of food served it makes sense. One plate easiler feeds 2, so if you're not in the mood for a large meal this is not the place for you. Pancakes are huge (about 10 inches in diameter). Country fried steak and biscuits with gravy are yummy! Interior is quite bright and flashy, so no romatic dinners here! If I get the chance I will visit this place again."}
{"text":"First impressions, I thought this was a joint.  Surprisingly, this restaurant was absolutely delicious.  Had breakfast at 10am accompanied by ginormous cocktails (It's Vegas after all).  The neon lighting and Amazon rainforest decorations truly adds to the dining experience.  Trips to Vegas must include this as a stop!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service and huge portion. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Not impressed- although being at the bar while we waited forever was nice- the food was not worth the wait.  Too bland and lacked skills from the chefs.  Waitress also did a disservice but not giving us any recommendations on the menu"}
{"text":"My wife, kids and I dined at the Peppermill for breakfast on 7/3/08. I remembered ate here as a kid, though all I remembered was their giant hot fudge sundaes (they still have them).

The Peppermill is a very odd place. From the outside it does not appear to be anything special. Step inside and you will find a coffee shop that looks like a Denny's on acid. There are blues, purples and pinks everywhere. There are mirrored ceilings, tiffany lamps and faux cherry blossom trees.

The waitresses are wearing very short kimono type shirts/skirts. Making things more bizarre is that there is also a night club in the back that has pools in it that spit out fire on top of the water. Despite all of the craziness, the restaurant is 100% coffee shop in the front.

SERVICE: Everything was right on the money here. There was a delay in bringing my food. Though not a big deal, the manager came over and took a percentage off of the bill without us asking. Everything was very prompt.

FOOD: We ordered breakfast. Their hashbrowns are unique, I have never had ones like it. They were great and I am glad I ordered a plate of them. I could tell that they take great pride in the quality and preparation of all their food. Everything was outstanding. The kids ordered kids plates and loved them. We ate one of their gigantic hot fudge sundaes. The bill was about what you would expect to spend at a Denny's.

RECOMMENDATION: For a great breakfast, you have to go to the Peppermill. It is located center strip and should be easily accessible from any of the Las Vegas hotels. It is truly a unique experience."}
{"text":"American food...oily, big, not healthy...the atmosphere is good....location is perfect....24/7 is making this place to be on top..."}
{"text":"Such a strange experience...food was blah, service was super slow, bartenders were flat out rude. On a positive note, our cocktails were tasty, and our server (Janeth) was very nice."}
{"text":"This is what I always imagined a Vegas diner to be like.  Colourful, great service, all day menus (they brought us a cocktail menu at 9 am.).

This is a retro throwback to a time in Vegas that really appeals to me.  

Food portions were huge.  I had oatmeal and it included walnuts, a full banana, milk and brown sugar.  

Our daughter had french toast with fruit and whipped cream.  I posted a photo of it here.  It was absolutely massive and amazingly tasty.

Thanks for an awesome breakfast and an even better Vegas experience."}
{"text":"This place had the feel of old Hollywood Vegas! 

The whole time I was there I felt like frank Sinatra, Hugh Hefner or dirk diggler were gonna walk out of the lounge. The blue carpet, oversized chairs, plush hot pink pillows by a firepit felt so 1970s. I almost felt like I should have had on bell bottoms and platform shoes. The waitresses were dressed in overall miniskirts with a mini hat and feathered hair. Classic!

My favorite spot in the whole restaurant was the lounge. The sunken fire pit with oversized couches was a great decor. The bad thing is if you drink too much and sit by the fireplace you will definitely pass out from the heat, it was unbearable. I ordered a mimosa and my girlfriend ordered a Bloody Mary. The drinks were large and filled with alcohol, well worth the money. 

If you eat at this restaurant make sure you order light or plan on sharing. These meals are hearty. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner all day long.

If you're ever in town make sure you stop at the Peppermill you will feel like you just went back in time."}
{"text":"If you like neon and you're into overpriced diner food with terrible service, this is your place. We were seated in the far side of the diner area for 20 minutes without even getting a water or seeing a server. The menu was not appealing to us at all, so we left. We were disappointed at our experience because we had read good reviews and thought we would like to try this Vegas staple. It does not live up to its hype and really didn't look to have much to offer as I looked at people's plates on the walks in and out. If you're looking for something along these lines, go to Blueberry Hill instead.The prices at Blueberry Hill are more acceptable for diner quality food and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"Basic heavy breakfast, no flavor. Not really worth the long wait. Rainbow sugar and Indoor cherry blossom trees were more impressive."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Maybe I am missing something, but any remnant of Rat Pack or previous organized Las Vegas business elements (wink, wink, nod, nod) is not evident. Maybe stains they left behind. Seriously. Have you seen this place? The diner stinks like old grease and dirty dish rag. The fireside lounge, well, let's just say, I threw all my clothes in the wash that I was wearing when I sat on those sofas. It does not evoke any coolness of the rough and tumble Vegas that some want to believe. It's more of a slimy, seedy underbelly. I need to go take another shower."}
{"text":"Claim to be the Best steak in Las Vegas years in a row. I would rate their steak with IHOP or Denny's. Poor quality meat. Tasted tough definitely needed a sharp steak knife. I think the only thing to get  there is breakfast and even then it doesn't seem like anything special. The decour was interesting and retro."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so good!  Food portions are large for sharing or left overs."}
{"text":"It was ok after all the the hype I saw on tv.. when you first walk in you may make a mistake and think you're in a strip club lol but it's not just old decor and fire on water it's still a solid place and service was good"}
{"text":"Food is alright, not bad for a dennys variant. But service....I get better service at McDonald's."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a month, it is awesome food and the service you get is great!. If you are in Vegas and want a fantastic meal with great service and ambiance, 24/7 you won't be disapointed! We have never has to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated. This place has the old Vegas feel to it."}
{"text":"I guess this place has been around but I never been so a bunch of my coworkers decided to come and check it out. 

There is a large menu of specialty drinks that I greatly appreciated. Most of them do not have descriptions so if you don't ask someone what is in it you will just be taking a leap of faith. 

There is a restaurant attached to the bar. I didn't get to go into the restaurant but I hear that the portion sizes are family style. Now the bar, it's pretty dark and smells like smoke. It's a very small area so the smoke really lingers. That is probably one of the biggest thing for me is the smell."}
{"text":"bubbling fire pit + peanuts + fake ivy + disorienting neon + lots of flat screens + random music videos + big red couches + mirrors + cocktail waitresses in weird long black polyester skirts + good drinks + random old couples making out in a corner = 4 stars."}
{"text":"The wait was pretty long for a Sunday morning. It was 40-45 minutes for just the two of us around 9:30-10am. Husband had the country fried steak and it was a good size. He said it was just average in taste. Not terrible-- but nothing memorable. I had the crab cake benedict which I enjoyed. The crab was very tasty in it. Even with the restaurant being very busy, our server got to us quickly and our food came out faster than I expected. So overall, a good place for a breakfast, but maybe the wait isn't for everyone."}
{"text":"Food was good nothing spectacular....wait was a little long. Staff was very disengaged and a little uninterested probably because they turn over so many tables. Mimosa was yummy, bloody Mary's were inconsistent. Eggs Benedict was avg. Hash was fresh and good. Pancakes were yummy. Overall would visit again.

Waiting area was pretty cool"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast and while it looked very busy at 10am during the week, it was just a 10 minute wait.  Most of the tables are jumbo sized booths that could fit a family of 10...it nearly swallowed the two of us whole.  The whole atmosphere in the restaurant was very fun and retro.

Based on the jumbo sized portions other Yelpers mentioned, probably to match their jumbo sized booths, the hubby and I shared.  I ordered a small Spinach Salad and he went with the Maserati Omelet.  

While we waited for our food, a photographer came around offering \"free\" pictures.  She came back during our meal with our free postcard picture souvenir and a sales pitch for the larger prints.  It's a nice effort, but a picture in a booth with a window in the background doesn't do it for me...especially for nearly $20 a print!  But I gladly took the freebie.

The omelet was HUGE and served with hashbrowns and an English muffin; the salad was normal sized.  So it was just the right amount of food for the two of us to share.  The omelet was an Italian take eggs filled with sausage, cheese and mushrooms and topped with Italian meat sauce and Parmesan.  It was super fluffy, flavorful and really good.  The spinach salad was okay, it was topped with bacon and hard boiled eggs."}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing the Fireside Lounge today as all I did was drink here. It's a very fun place to hang with friends. Red and Purple lights, a huge firepit and lush red sofa's to chill on with friends. The waitresses were dressed very classic in silky black dresses that I thought was a great touch to the experience of this place. Drinks are not the cheapest here but you are paying for the fun decor etc. I will be visiting this place again... they don't allow hats to be worn but besides that the dress code seems basic. The staff was cool with the wild crowd we had the night we were there and always behaved professional and fun."}
{"text":"I grew up at the Peppermill, and I've never had a bad experience. There portions of food are the size of two faces, but that's not why I go there. It reminds me of Vegas 1970's.
It's a classic!
The neon lighting to booth style seats in the Fireside area you feel as if you're stepping into a world once been. You would swear you saw Elvis Presley walking through, and not an impersonator.
I've gone to the Peppermill all hours of the day, in all states of intoxication and never once have I been treated poorly. I've always been treated like a rockstar!
The girls on the restaurant side can be a little overwhelmed at times because it's usually slam packed no matter what time of the day you go. I never expect my food to be delivered quickly because it is always slam packed! This doesn't bother me because it allows me the opportunity to go to the Fireside and enjoy a drink. Their prices for drinks versus the portions are absolutely Fair. However, the portions of food you receive are enough to feed a small village in New Guinea. The prices for the portions of food and the flavor of food seem almost cruel because they are so cheap.
If you've never been to the Peppermill, then you've never been to Vegas classic!
Every single kid in my generation has ditched school once and gone to the Peppermill or party all night and gone to the Peppermill for a 6 a.m. breakfast.
Can I think of one bad experience I've ever had at the Peppermill including the food? No, not at all.

If people have bad experiences, I believe their expectations are too high and they don't enjoy the Ambiance for what it's worth.

If you really want to treat yourself, order the French toast.
I would suggest splitting it with somebody if you have a small stomach because it's one of those things where your eyes are bigger than your stomach.

REASONS TO VISIT THE PEPPERMILL:
1. 70's Old Vegas neon style decor
2. Fireside lounge with lots of cozy seating
3. Huge food portions
4. Reasonable prices
5. Amazing food"}
{"text":"Honestly, the omelet wasn't good, the coffee was weak, and the total was $20.  My server was wonderful, but that's about it.  I don't quite understand all the five star reviews unless the reviewers were drunk...  oh, right."}
{"text":"Well.......   I have been wanting to go here forever.  I'm a Las Vegas Native.   Seems kind of 'touristy', but I still enjoyed it.  James made a good martini.  The Philly Steak was pretty good.   I'll come back and try breakfast (I saw the French dip go by, looked good).

I was trying to add a picture"}
{"text":"Here again and just love love love this place!  My friends had the chicken fried steak and eggs and they said it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Peppermill is OK, that's about it.  Really expensive for what you get, I think.  There are better places to eat, but I confess...breakfast isn't a staple meal in LV.  Coffee shops in the casinos are the same price, even less...  It does glimmer in that old-world tacky sorta 70's Vegas flare, as contrived as it is, with lots of neon and psychadelic colors.  Sorta fun to see, once.  I miss the old coffee shop in the Mirage.  They closed it in 08, I think.  We tried the TI coffee shop, NOT the same thing.  Planning to try the new one in Aria, next week.  Maybe it can measure up the the Mirage."}
{"text":"This review was meant to go out when I last ate here with my best friend so ignore the date. We love this place, what we do is get all dressed up 1940's style and we have been doing it like this since 2001 when everything in our hometown Vegas has been done. We order nachos oh they are soooooo good site by the fire and drink huge strawberry daq's just next time keep me away from the sprinkles and straws. I made a mess once but was not my fault it was 2am and th estraw wanted to land on the ground. 

Great place to go. Its old school Vegas and it stayed that way."}
{"text":"We came here after our comedy show at the Riviera. The buffet we planned to go to was closed. We were greeted warmly and the place looked nice.

My rating is on the TERRIBLE SERVICE and FOOD:  The service was terrible!! Our waitress Inka was not welcoming! She rarely gave us any attention. She did not ask for our drinks, we had to ask her for the drinks we wanted after our meal came. Fortunately, a waiter passing by gave us water when we first sat down. The food took a good while. I ordered the salmon while my husband along with his brother and girlfriend ordered turkey burgers. The wait was long. The waitress never came by to reassure us of our meal was coming. My order came with a salad and I didn't get it until our entrees were given. My husband's burger was bland. When we got our check, I was supposed to get bread with my meal. We went to pay, I asked the waiter was I charged extra for it because I never received it. She asked who was my waiter. Here comes Inka standing next to her. I repeated the question. Her Response? \"It comes with your meal but I forgot to give it to you.\" There was no sorry or anything. We have never refused to give someone a tip before. She was the first. If you don't like your job, then quit! 

The food is expensive and was not worth it. I will not come back again during my next visit in Vegas."}
{"text":"I know this place is ghetto famous. I get that some think it deserves more stars simply for irony.  

But here's the deal:
Do I want irony in Vegas? Where there are soooo many competing amazing places that are open all night?

Peppermill is the kind of place that would mean so much to me if it was the only late night diner in a town with nothing else to do and the strange dark neon/art deco feel was just kitschy. But in my head, I can't put black lights and Hawaiian themes together, so it just feels really strange. I couldn't feel calm in the place if you gave me 3 shots of whisky and a valium. The cocktail servers in the lounge wear long evening gowns, and the restaurants servers where strange teensy server shorts with aloha shorts. It's just very very strange. 

That said, everyone should go once."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of Peppermill is reminiscent of Downtown Las Vegas' \"hey day\". The motif of neon lights and wall to wall mirrors (looks like deconstructed disco balls) scream \"old school\".

You have plenty of choices when it comes to the fare. It's quite a cornucopia / mishmash of food. 

I had the pulled pork sandwich which was quite tasty, but it wasn't something that wowed me. Pork was tender and shredded, but was a basic sandwich.

Basically, I should have tried something that was more on the \"diner\" side (burgers, sandwiches) instead of something like a pulled pork sandwich that takes a lot of time to cook. Basically I learned not only from here, but from any place that serves \"BBQ\", if there's no pit and you don't smell it in the air, don't order \"BBQ\".  

In conclusion, Peppermill is more for nostalgia of earlier Vegas with Denny's type food. It's just a smidge above Denny's, but not by much."}
{"text":"Classic american diner with all the Vegas flair. Food is always good and very plentiful, prices are good and its open 24/7 doesn't get much better than that, Aloha"}
{"text":"If you enjoy IHOP, you'll love this place as much, if not more. Only big difference is the wait--which matters if you're super hungry! Love the fact that it's 24/7. The retro feel is pretty cool too. We all got ourselves a French toast collage each and a big bowl of oatmeal to share cuz... why not? LOL! Huge portions here! Obviously, it was way too much food, but we stuffed ourselves anyway. Everything was prepared well, but the French toast wasn't the absolute freshest or softest I've ever had. Service is also kinda meh. What didn't help our hanger was them telling us it's a 20-25 minute wait and it becoming over an hour wait. We found out (the hard way) that they have two separate lists--one for small parties and one for large parties. We were a small party (3) and kept hearing other people being called, all the while they kept telling us there were only 2 parties ahead of us. That said, try to avoid peak times!!!"}
{"text":"Now this place has been around for so long and holds a lot of childhood memories when we stayed at Circus Circus and my Grandfather used to bring me here. I also brought my teenage kids here when we came to Vegas. Hubby and I always make a visit to get a Bloody Mary from the bar and the food portions are large and shareable. It's crowded at times but well worth the wait. Prices are descent and food is good. So happy to see that this place is still around and thriving."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! And the portions are big enough for 2 people! My fiancé and I visited the Peppermill on our trip to Las Vegas via a recommendation from one of my good friends. It was not on the strip, so I was a little unsure about heading there at first, but it is more than worth it. We were there for breakfast and the omelets were huge! The menu is pretty extensive, mostly basic dinner food, but something for everyone. I am a lover of breakfast to begin with, but I was over the moon about this place. Did I mention their sugar is colored? At first glance, it almost looks like glitter! LOVE! The service was quick and everyone was friendly. The waitresses wear uniforms that go along with the ambiance of the place: Vegas meets townie dinner meets flamingos...very neat little place that I would have never found if it weren't for a friend who visits her family. I will definitely be returning for another breakfast or two on our next trip to Vegas! Go and get an omelet, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We stopped by before dinner for drinks and snacks.  It was what you have in mind if you were to say \"diner in old Vegas\".  The service was good.  The food was so-so.  We got mozzarella sticks, which were run of the mill frozen with a pasta dipping sauce. The sliders were big on bread, small on beef.  The beer was cold.  The mojitos were spotty.  The first one was good, but second was *really* sweet. That being said, the mojito was probably the best thing we had while at the Peppermill.

The place was cute for its old school charm, but the food was something that we could have done without."}
{"text":"Great meal had to wait 30 minutes to be seated excellent service three huge breakfast 60 bucks with 20% tip very good."}
{"text":"I really like this place, its my go to spot for that transition from hang over into semi sobriety when I cruisin the streets o' Vegas. It really is decorated weird, with purple and pink neon lights everywhere... and trees, wtf? I dunno, they have two shifts of servers... the B team should be the C team, and the A team should be my girlfriend! ;-) 
Their food? Ok taste, HUGE portions. I always get omelette's, they never disappoint.  
Their service? Friendly, fast, and they dont harass you if youre just hanging out talking after your food is gone.  And depending on the shift, the servers are seriously gorgeous.
Their prices? cheap, for vegas, but everything is relative, if this place was in tucson with these prices I'd probably burn it down, but for vegas, cheap ;-)
The only alcohol I've ever drank here is Bloody Mary's, extra spicy, 100% delicious!
Cheers-
 dRe'"}
{"text":"There was a super long wait on Saturday morning. For all the hype, the food was ok, nothing crazy. The pancakes are ginormous and super dense. The sausage was really delicious, the bacon wasn't my fave. The inside felt like a darker, purpler Sizzler straight out of 1990. One more star just for having the sparkly fun and colorful rock crystal sugar in the sugar dispenser on the table."}
{"text":"Well, when you ask anyone native of the area where to get a good breakfast outside of all the casinos in Vegas EVERYONE says The Peppermill. Tacky 50's diner feel with a 70's disco themed decor it's lemme say.....quite \"interesting to the eye\" (haha).  Anyways despite the shocking decor upon walking in we were kindly greeted and taken to our booth. We were promptly brought waters and menu's. I ordered the egg white veggie omelette. It was great, the eggs were fluffy the veggies were sauteed and it wasn't greasy at all! As if the omelette wasn't enough it also came with homefries, fresh fruit and toast. My friends all ordered some different variations of omelettes all which looked great and they said tasted even better. All in all experience was good, food reliable, and servers were all very nice and helpful when asking them questions about different things to do around the city."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, old vegas style! Fun neon lights, fun colored sugar. We went for breakfast food was great. Must have been a dozen egg omelette, fresh and home cooked. It was very busy and all the staff was nice and prompt. I highly recommend it, not over priced!"}
{"text":"We ate here 2 times while here for our 4 day trip. Huge portions so you better come hungry. No wait, very quick service, delicious food. The omelettes are enormous! Recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Between the pictures and the amazing reviews I couldn't take it anymore. I had to try this place. The smell is absolutely mouth watering and hits you hard as soon as you walk in.They have a guy walking around taking pictures of couples and families, I thought that was a nice touch. They serve alcohol from the bar but to make things easier on you they have bartenders walking around taking your order. The neon lights made for an interesting decor. The only thing that we tasted that was so-so was the biscuits and gravy. I would skip that and go with pancakes or any other breakfast dish."}
{"text":"AWESOME!  only been a few times but it's  one of my favorites  in town.
Service, food and atmosphere all great. Highly recommend going  there."}
{"text":"I always bring the fam here. It's great food and that old school feel that gives me a good feeling. Bloody Mary's are the best. And also the biscuits and gravy. This place is bom bay. Love it. And the girls are cute respectful and great service. Jen helped us out. She's a pretty white female. With great customer service. And a cute body. Lol."}
{"text":"Food is THE BEST!! Huge portions, huge selection of cocktails! Great service!  :) 

Breakfast all day and night!!"}
{"text":"Always great food and great customer service. Worth the hour long wait. Hang out in the lounge and enjoy a cocktail from James!!!!"}
{"text":"Was a little hesitant looking at photos of the space and the location but definitely go eat here! It was only two of us so we walked right up and sat at the counter. We ordered the chicken nachos and they were huge and so good!"}
{"text":"The best place in Vegas for breakfast. Huge portions for a good price. They must give you a half a dozen eggs in the omelette. If you order the fruit plate it will be enough to eat on for several days. The bloody Mary's are excellent. My only disappointment is they seem to be letting the waitresses wear pants now. Part of the charm to this place was the old Mel's dinner outfits the were wearing. It goes with the theme. But hey you can't beat this place for breakfast. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Listen...when you're in Vegas and you're down on your luck go where the locals go for the best dam food in town!!  Their breakfast is the best bar none and the fire place lounge  (over 21 only) is a really great place to rehab, get a bite to eat, and that last drink before you go back home after a long night in the club!  The parking lot is an awesome make shift camp site when you can't quite drive yet and need to chill too!!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with the quality of the food.The portion sizes are gigantic,but it was pretty much comparable to Dennys.We had to wait 40 mins for a table,and place a drink order with someone else other than our waiter which was stupid.The atmosphere was neat,and it would be a good place to grab a drink if you are near that part of the strip.Definatly quantity over quality in this place,and not somewhere I would go out of my way for again."}
{"text":"*Blink* I don't get it. 
I'm the easiest person to please when it comes to food. Even Taco Bell tastes like gourmet 5 star cuisine when you're drunk and hungry. 

Maybe it's because I'm from the South where we have stellar home cookin', but this place was NOT good. I'm giving it 2 stars because it wasn't terrible, but it definitely was NOT good. 
My girl friends and I stumbled into this place at 5 or 6am after my bachelorette party because our cabbie recommended it and it was right next to the Riviera where we were staying. 

Us: Can we walk back to Riviera in our heels from there?
Cabbie: Girl, you can CRAWL.

Nuff said. Let's go THERE.
We got a wide variety of stuff- corned beef & hash, biscuits & sausage gravy, buffalo chicken wrap, something else, and something else (sorry, the night was a bit hazy haha). We tried a bite of everyone else's food, and not one of us 5 girls were the least bit impressed. 

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll go to the 24 hour Indian place inside Riviera if I'm hungry in the middle of the night/morning. Too bad I didn't find out about it until my last 2 hours there."}
{"text":"The food is amazing... I Went there with a few friends, and I just fell in love with this place."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK. We only stopped by briefly for a drink at the bar but I loved this place! It reminds me of a New Jersey diner. It brought me right back home. 

There's fire pits and these pretty water fountains. An average but cool bar. 

We ordered two drinks from their custom menu. I had their Godiva martini--It's to die for! and my husband had a guy drink.

We will return late night again to check out their food because I heard MANY good things :)"}
{"text":"We were here for breakfast so didn't experience the fireside lounge and drinks. Breakfast was very good. The French toast and bacon were great and so was the Mediterranean omelette. I even had a delicious cup of hot chocolate. Seriously, the hot chocolate was some of the best I've had. I want to return for cocktails at the fireside lounge."}
{"text":"I saw peppermill cafe online and it was highly recommended. We made a reservation for a Tuesday morning with a group of 12 and were more than impressed. If you want a classic throwback to old vegas, have a meal here. The fireside lounge is pretty unique and the restaurant is tastefully ornate. Meals were huge and drinks were delicious. Our server was on point and had a great personality. I will absolutely return next time I'm in town. Make a reservation or plan to wait at least 30 min because it gets very crowded!"}
{"text":"Yeah,  it's iconic. If you've never been, you may enjoy going once. 
The portions are huge,  servers are attentive and is very historic for Vegas.
We had the nachos. HUGE!
The lounge is colorful and fun to sit in. 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is my new mandatory stop when in Vegas. The fireside  lounge is really cool, (kinda looks like a porn set shoot!), purple & pink neon lighting, round couch area to sit back and enjoy a cocktail. Over the top Vegas style, nice! The hi lite of the lounge is the water feature with flames emanating from the middle surrounded by a circular set of couches to kick back on. Our group  rolled in to get a Bloody Mary. Spicy yes, lots of good vodka, yes, big stalk of celery, Cucumber slice sidecar on the goblet, cherry tomato impaled on a plastic toothpick-very tasty indeed. We saw another group who ordered Scorpions, a massive 1/2 gallon goblet filled with Rum and stuff ; 24\" straw included. Food wise , at breakfast,  I ended up going big , NY Steak & Eggs, perfect Med Rare cooked seasoned slab of cow, perfect scrambled eggs contained in a ramekin, Killer hash browns, Coffee was eh, but who cares. Good service , a bit more $ than other places, but I'll gladly pay more for the good stuff. Peppermill, ambiance, good food, strong drink, what's not to like!!
We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Sitting in the fireside lounge is an uncomfortably sexual experience. But If you like the 1970s as much as you like being molested you will love relaxing by the fire pit. 

3 stars for great servers and huge portions. Minus 2 stars for creepy stains on the furniture."}
{"text":"Infamous place with lots of ambiance.  Casual to dressy attire with a creative and friendly waitstaff.  There are two sides to this establishment: one is the lounge that includes the fireside pit; and the other is the diner side.  Throughout the interior there's an array of neon lights, mirrors, plants, and steps.  

The portions are very large here and the prices do reflect the size.  Here is their menu http://www.usmenuguide.com/peppermill.html
The food is good but not great.  If you go here, it is for ambiance and to chill."}
{"text":"Don't go here, it's ghetto! I got robbed while sitting at the bar. A girl and 2 guys grabbed my purse and ran out. Apparently this happens a lot. WARNING!!!! Management did nothing. This place has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"The Fireside Lounge is an old school cheesily decorated place not to be missed!  I'm sure back in the day, it was pretty amazing, and although dated, it kind of still IS!  It's rare to find places like this that didn't feel the pressure to \"update\" their look, and so we younger folks get to enter a kind of time capsule and imagine a Friday night out on the town in our platforms & polyester disco dresses!  Big round banquettes for groups make it a nice place to stop & hang out without feeling the Vegas Rush to move on & not miss something fabulous.  Flashback decor includes mirrors on all the walls, red upholstery, faux forest-like greenery and a central fireplace/fountain (propane bubbling up thru the water making the flames dance on the surface).  A good experience over all.  Fifth star of the rating falls away because, although very pleasant, it seemed like the wait staff wasn't that efficient."}
{"text":"I liked the ambiance of this diner and I appreciated the variety in the menu selections, but I thought it was a little overpriced. I got the veggie burger and requested no mayo, but had to send it back because there was mayo on it. When the bun came back, it was covered in butter. What do I have to do to get a plain bun around here? Unfortunately I was too sleep deprived and too cranky to enjoy the food by then. It didn't help that my bf and I started arguing. And the table across from us offered unsolicited advice on how to get ketchup out of the bottle. I wish I was in a better mood, I don't think I gave this place a fair shot."}
{"text":"Been here several times like hanging out by the fire pit and having some cocktails always had fun hanging out with friends especially when they're from out of town even though pepper Mills and a lot of other towns besides Vegas but this one's on the strip and has a nice view"}
{"text":"The food was terrible, arrived cold, and was nothing like the sister restaurant in Reno. I don't understand. Cafe Milano in Peppermill Hotel was so good. This was... well terrible!

The service was slow, out food was over salted and arrived cold, and we just hated it. Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Me and some friends regularly go to Vegas to relax with some good conversations over drinks and cigars. Vegas being a cigar friendly city has always been a huge draw for us, and the retro Vegas vibe of the Fireside lounge has been one of our regular haunts. We were very disappointed to learn that cigar smoking, as of recent, is no longer allowed in the Fireside Lounge (only low grade tobacco that you inhale through your lungs in the form of a cigarette is allowed). A friend in our party was informed of this after he had already lit up a fine cigar! Given this change in the smoking policy, I'm not sure we (or those we know) will be making a return to visit. It's sad to see the classic and iconic Peppermill change in this sad way."}
{"text":"The reviews from everyone else are accurate. This place has great food and lots of it! And there is usually a line no matter what time you go there. So sneak into the lounge, drift back into the 70's styling and enjoy."}
{"text":"A classic!! Great service and delicious food. HUGE PORTIONS TOO!!!!! Try the egg and ham omelette (w/bacon) AAAAMAZING!!!  

Plenty of parking but this place gets packed fast. Wait time can be up to 45mins so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"what a vegas treasure my buddy took me there for a hang over breakfast that totally did the job...huge portions and excellent food"}
{"text":"Price seems a bit high at first but then you get your meal and you can see why. The portions are pretty big here and the food is good. I ordered the pastrami burger, which was not the best, but was still pretty good. Service was ok but it usually pretty busy and you can always spot some interesting people."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to check this place out and FINALLY got to do it this morning! 

Probably shouldn't have chosen a Sunday morning to finally come here, but it's my birthday today and I wanted to do it! We walked thru the door and were quoted a 20 minute wait. It was more like 25, but thats okay. It gave us time to take in the place and let our appetite swell.

The inside is very retro(which if you know me at all, you know I LOVE!) They have the purple and pink tubing running all thru the interior, with some artificial trees hanging over the boothes. It was pretty frickin cool! They have TV's set about the place with some screen shots of different locations around the world. This was a bit wierd as it went from Bahamas(sweet!) to weeds in Beatty, Nv (???). Didn't exactly make sense, but still kinda cool.

We are seated in our booth and a guy comes to get our drink order. I order a Sierra Mist and my friend a water. They very promptly bring us 2 waters.lol okay. The waitress chuckled when I told her this and brought out my soda. No harm, no foul. Waitress is very nice and very attentive, which is especially appreciated considering how slammed they are during this time.

I ordered the Masarati Omelette(12.95) and my friend ordered the Peppermill Omelette(also 12.95). Those things were freaking huge! lol They both came with an order of hash browns and toast. Damn, they were really tasty! Mine had ham and musrooms and tons of american and peperjack cheese in it with some Marinara sauce on the top. It was very different from any kind of omelette I had ever tried before and I must say it was scrumptious! 

This was such a great experience and I can't wait to come back and try different things on the menu and check out the Fireside Lounge one of these days!

4 solid stars."}
{"text":"Come for the food and drinks, stay for the incredible people watching. Any time of day is perfect to head here. You will not be let down what so ever. The drinks kick your ass."}
{"text":"This reminds me of the diners from back at home in NYC. Not the Fireside Lounge side, but the Peppermill.
Insanely huge portions, bottomless cup of coffee. What is not to love?"}
{"text":"This place suckkkkedddd. Bad food. 
I came here for my graduation dinner and I definitely left feeling like I missed out on a nice, celebratory dinner.
My mum's lettuce was floppy. My gyro looked like a period pad (no joke, I wish I took a picture!)
The waitress seemed so flustered that we felt like we were bothering her by asking for drink refills and the food she forgot.
The cool part was the fire lounges, seriously, those are cool! But, the whole place was filthy! If you can tell a place doesn't vacuum, I don't wanna be there. 
Sorry, Peppermill, time to retire or get new staff!"}
{"text":"This place has become my go to breakfast stop coming in, while in, and/or about to leave town. I was very impressed with Munch's breakfast. The linguica they use is one of the best I've tasted. My scrambled eggs done to perfection. The hostess and my server (#36, haha) are friendly. I need to keep going back until I cover the menu."}
{"text":"Time warp back to the 1970's and enjoy large portions of mediocre food.  The Peppermill is best visited slightly buzzed and before noon (all the best drinking takes place before lunch).  This place serves food that is on par with Denny's, but I love the interior and the service.
Huge menu, comical clientele and you can actually feel like you are in LV, not Disneyland or some uber resort in Dubai.  Hell yes it is tacky, and that's the god damn way it is supposed to be.  Haven't been inside the lounge, just the restaurant side for breakfast type meals and early morning drinking."}
{"text":"One of the best places for bfast or lunch in Vegas! It's not in a casino. Open 24 hours. Don't miss out. It's always packed and there is a reason for that!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is nostalgic! Still has the same great service and food! I love that majority of tables are booths and love the blue purple pink neon decor. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Portion are huge and very good.  Seasoning was on the spot, favor full, but not too salty.  Server was very good to us.  Will come back and try the desserts."}
{"text":"Service was ok.  Food was like rating at Dennys.  I was referred to this restaurant by the valet at LVH.  I should have known...  Ordered a steak with veggies.  Steak was flat. No seasoning.  I had to dump a lot of salt to make it passable.  a ribeye steak.  Vegetables were frozen, microwaved....even  a soda was $3.00. Do yourself a favor.  Go to Dennys, it would be less expensive and better."}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend for late night dinner after driving from CA.

After reading the reviews and looking at all the pictures I guess I kinda expected to eat around some sort of fire, but I was wrong. The fire is actually in the lounge area which I couldn't go into since I'm not 21. We were seated in the restaurant area which was decorated with lots of plants and flower decor with blue and pink lighting. I expected it to be very blue and pink, but a lot darker, so this was way brighter than I expected. 

I ordered the Conquest Sandwich and coffee and my boyfriend ordered a burger with mushrooms ( I dont remember the name). 

The coffee was HUGE, probably as big as a regular soda cup. It was pretty cool for pictures, but since it was so big, by the time I got halfway the coffee would already be cold. 

The mushroom burger came first. It came with a bunch of fries and a side of ranch. The fries was pretty especially with the ranch which was very light, not like most other places with thick fatty ranch.  The burger LOOKED delicious , but it was so soggy and soaked in juices from the sauces and meat that it just fell apart once my boyfriend picked it up. He couldn't even eat the buns anymore because it was just completely soggy, so he just ate the contents of the burger with a knife and fork.  

The Conquest was pretty good from what I recall. I finished my whole half of the sandwich which me and my boyfriend split. It wasn't as fantastic as I expected from the description on the menu, but it was good. It didn't come with any sides at all, so it was just the sandwich. 

The portions we got weren't worth the price of the food. I expected more for what I paid, especially after reading these reviews. I also expected the food to be a lot better because, yet again, the great reviews. 

The service was alright though. The waitress would check up on us here and there to fill the coffee and water. She'd also check to make sure we had everything we needed. 

We probably won't come back here again. At least not until I'm 21 and can check out the lounge :P"}
{"text":"There were three of us together wanting to get some grub and right when we walk in we already knew their was going to be a wait; it was pretty packed - the receptionist said that it was going to be a 25-30 minute wait, which ended up to be 1.5 hours! I also noticed that she told that to every single customer that and they ended up waiting just as long as we did if not longer. The decor is different, unique. The waitresses were on point and it seemed like they all worked together. The food was pretty good - worth the wait, it was an awesome amount of food too! Besides the receptionist lying about the wait it ober all was a good experience. Also, a lady walks around and asks to take your pictures which was actually pretty nice rather than annoying because well you are trying to eat,  we ended up buying the pics too!"}
{"text":"Tonight I witnessed them kick out a gentlemen in a turban because of their \"no hat\" policy. I hope he sues them and shuts them down. Ignorant. #peppermilllounge"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here.  The place was busy but we were seated right away.  We sat in a U-shaped booth.  The restaurant is big and it is can get very loud.  I had the NY steak and eggs so the portions that everyone was talking about didn't correlate with my meal since my steak is weighed.  Though, the hash browns seam a bit stingy now that I think about it.  My wife ordered a San Fran scramble.  That portion was big.  We took it home in box.  Our waitress was fast to take our order and serve us.  She asked if I needed a coffee refill and said it would be refilled.  I did't know this was done by someone else as I finished my meal to stop the young man, who also sat us, to refill me.  I was irritated by not having my coffee refilled during my meal.  A lady gave us a complimentary photo.  Another lady came by and asked if we wanted cocktails.  So, two things are preventing me from giving this place 4 stars which are:  small portion of hash browns and the wait for a coffee refill."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant for breakfast in Las Vegas.

I cant count how many times I've come stumbling in here whether its been sun up, sun down, middle of the night, etc. The San Francisco special and the crab cake benedict are my favorite. To top this off I usually go for orange juice or some sort of cocktail or beer if I'm in the mood for another drink. I'm a fan of diner type food and the food has that feel with a Vegas party atmosphere inside the restaurant. The prices are very fair also...great food at low price is always a good thing. 

What can I say, I'm a fan!

Breakfast 4/5/2014 - and previous visits"}
{"text":"This was an excellent restaurant. My family and I went for breakfast. The portions were huge. The food was delicious. The prices were reasonable. The ambience is great too. Especially the lounge area."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken and red pepper pasta, got the fishbowl drink and the mushroom soup was yummy! Btw get there muffin not the toast if you order breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Me and hubby always come here when we are Vegas, it's kind of a tradition and we loive it. Chill relaxi by lounge place"}
{"text":"Neon Lights, Good Drinks, and a Old Atmosphere. I love it! 

Peppermill is located on the strip north of the Wynn. You really can't miss it with the big neon blue and pink sign. I feel like it's just a classic place. I mean my mom used to work there back in her day, its been in movies, and it still packed on the weekend. Peppermill is a unique place. It has been a while since I walked into a bar and was just in awe. I know it's an older place and it could use some updating but fuck it, this place is cool. 
You have two parts, the lounge and the restaurant. My friend made reservation for the lounge for his and my best friends birthday for 20 people or so. We walked in on Saturday around 8pm and got to our table and started to order drinks. I love their drink menu. The have some basic drinks and then some ice cream items and even the scorpion. This night I was the DD so I could only taste a little bit of everything. Everyone got something a little different. Alabama slammer, grasshopper, creamsicle, and mudslide to name a few. Everyone had a blast and their happy hour is awesome. They have 50% off well drinks, house wines, and domestic beers. Also their beer are in a bottle. We found that out when we ordered Irish car bombs. No biggie tho. 
Inside the lounge they have a fire pit surrounded by water. Every time I walked by the seats were all taken and there was a lot of canoodling. The decor reminded us of poison ivy's lair with all the leaves and plants and also a strip club. They also have TVs playing different concerts. It was interesting because music was playing but we could hear each other. We had a large area and a lot of people but we could all hear each other. We didn't have to yell across the table or yell in someones ear. Peppermill was a blast from the past and I want to go back."}
{"text":"A lounge for more drinks after nightclubs or gentlemen's clubs, did we even need that? I was pretty drunk already... But it's Vegas, let's just drink all day everyday! I usually don't go to a place that is not in a hotel in Vegas, oh well.... We were there already...

Just had a beer at lounge area while waiting for our food table, it was crowded at almost 5 in the morning. This place looks so old school Vegas, WTH.... The food wasn't so good, not a good place for Vegetarians or Pescetarians....:( service was extremely slow, but our waitress was friendly. 

This type of place is really not my thing, please let's just go back to our hotel to order room service like always.....;p"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Vegas.  I love the feel inside the place, purple booths, neon lights, waitresses in horrible uniforms.  The food is average, but what it lacks in taste it makes up for in portion size.  The food is good,  just not spectacular.  A ton of variety, I've been there several times and don't think I have ever repeated a dish.  
The lounge attached to the restaurant is really cool.  Dark circular seating areas make it a great place for cocktails with friends or dates.  The fire pit near the front is cool too, with plasma TVs all around you shouldn't miss any of the game either.
There seems to be a good mix of tourist and locals here.  I think when you come across a spot locals keep going back to, you have found a special place that hasn't been totally destroyed by tourists."}
{"text":"Whether you are visiting Vegas or you are a local, the Peppermill is the best place for breakfast! The atmosphere is a little outdated but I love it. I always order the Eggs Benedict and I am never disappointed, you get three poached eggs with one order! The Bloody Marys are to die for, and the sparkling breakfast drinks are good too. I always like to go in the lounge and have a drink by the fire ring something about it feels unique and it's become a tradition for me. Do yourself a favor and come here for the best breakfast in town!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill has maintained it 'a reputation for over 40 years as a reliable place to get a decent meal. I was there recently to check it out and had a good experience with the food. However, as tasty as the Bloody Mary was I would bet it had a minuscule if any vodka in it.  Waitress was friendly. Great tourist trap!"}
{"text":"The peppermill in Las Vegas is a great place for any meal.  Its portions are a little huge."}
{"text":"Love the Fireside Lounge and having dinner at Peppermill. The sliders and potatoes along with their Chocolate Banana make me want to go back. Their Chicken and Red Pepper pasta is phenomenal, if you decide to eat at the restaurant side. The decoration is super cute and the staff outfits are as well. The graveyard manager is so sweet!!

We decided to try the breakfast yesterday, 1/7/18. We got there at around 10:30, there was no line at the front booth, we walked in at the same time as another couple. We were not greeted by the THREE people that were standing at the booth, talking among themselves. We stood there for a minute without them even acknowledging or the other couple that came after us. We told them we would like a table for two and they did not respond all they did is look down to see if there was a table for us and told us to follow one of the two young ladies .

Our server did not come to our table. We asked somebody else who was walking by for some drinks......at least 30 minutes past and our server still had not taken our order. There was a table next to us full of people who arrived at least 15 minutes after us and they had already received their food.

We told one of the servers that we were ready to order and they told us that they would get our server. They did. Her name was Amanda and she never smiled. We made our order and after that she only came back twice. One included her coming to give us the check.

We decided to pay at the front with the cashier. She also never smiled!!!! Didn't even tell us or any of the other people that paid before us to have a nice day. 

I think the morning staff needs customer service classes. Starting with those that are supposed to greet us, those who serve us and the cashier.

It was very disappointing. We will definitely not go back for breakfast..the late staff is much nicer. But we will be back for dinner and possibly drinks at the lounge."}
{"text":"I came back after getting specific instructions from my friend 'Don't worry about the dining portion, go straight back to the bar/lounge area\".  So I came back and did just that and it felt like I went into a time warp!

They have the curved couches with pillows which are really comfy to enjoy a drink in that you might just fall asleep.  The main draw of the room is a water feature off to the side with a gas fire coming out of it.  

The lights change colors and all the TV's are playing music videos (when is the last time you've seen a music video?).  While it sounds like it's almost a tacky environment, it really is cool and not dirty at all.  

Experience wise, the waitresses have a tiny chair they come in sit down on to take your order.  They call you \"doll\" and a bunch of other retro names and then smoothly walk away their flowing black dress not far behind.

Our friend billed the lounge portion as the \"place you go to seal the deal\" and I could tell there were many couples here.  Maybe not as cool as the Mandarin Bar, but the drinks are way more reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! My friend and I shared the Mediterranean omelette and an order of the small French toast and they were both to die for. We took the left over French toast home and it was even good served cold. The service is exceptional as well. They also have a cute little bar with a fire place which is perfect for a date night."}
{"text":"Man, this is the second time I've been to pepper mill and the first time was a blur since I was a bit hammered, but the second time was a bit amazing.

Now one thing with the peppermill, is you may have to wait, but don't worry, you can make the most of your time by either playing at the slots they have or just chilling and having a mimosa in their fireside lounge. The fireside lounge has this 70s strip club kind of feel with its decor of red and dim lights. They have a multitude of drinks to choose from and you can go old school and get a White Russian or zombie. 

Finally when you get seated, they have both a regular menu, but really is more famous is there breakfast menu. By the way, this is as good as any Vegas buffet, because their portions are insane and much tastier. Had the Maserati omelette and I was in heaven. How often can you have italian with breakfast? I wanted to eat more but I was so full. Sometimes wish I was a fatty so u could of eaten it all. Can't beat italian sausage with eggs covered with a tangy pasta red sauce. Delicious! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Vegas the morning after.  Enormous portions (\"huge\" doesn't do them justice, they're so big), decent prices and a cool 80s-ish lighting scheme plays up the Vegas experience while hungover.  Fireside lounge is pretty awesome; I'd suggest having a drink or two with a small group around the fire.  The ambiance is amazing.  It's different than what you'll find in the rest of sin city.  Everything from the food to the coffee to the rainbow sugar sprinkles are fantastic.  Check it out before you leave town for home; your friends will be impressed that you know of such a \"local\" spot and you won't be disappointed.  Been coming here for years and plan to continue!  Perfect way to wrap up a weekend in Vegas.  Also, be sure to order breakfast.  Always the best."}
{"text":"Omg ew. Lol this place gave me so much nausea and anxiety. It's full of tacky colors and old stained carpet (I understand the theme, I just don't agree with it). The place was PACKED. We stopped by prior to our departure to LA on a Sunday for brunch and we were quickly regretful. Service was extremely slow and none of the food was worth the wait. My eggs were inedible, I didn't eat much. I did, however, get my leftovers(all my food) to-go and gave it to a homeless outside. :) never again"}
{"text":"I usually end up taking all my friends who are visiting from out of town, to this place. The Fireside Lounge is my favorite section of the Peppermill. If you want good eats 24/7, try the diner that is attached to the lounge. Prices are great, considering this restaurant is located on the Strip."}
{"text":"Still love it, even though they've now got enough flat-screen tvs in the Fireside Lounge to have, like,  a 1:1 ratio to customers when the place is packed. I still really enjoy that the waitress are in full-length black evening-type gowns at all hours. It make it feel special, even if it's only 4 in the afternoon.

They need to dust the forest of trees in the main dinging area."}
{"text":"A bit of a hidden gem. I have been to Vegas 20+ times and had never been here. The food is delicious, the portions are huge, and the staff is attentive.  Great vibe and well worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great service and huge portions. Get the banana split. Its huge!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the old school Vegas environment. Loved the indoor bonfire surrounded by water even more! Was not too pleased with the omelet. Tasted bland. I nicely complained. They took it off my bill. Without me even asking. That's great service! I would totally go back for drinks and the pancakes or waffles. Totally a throw-back to what Vegas used to be. I loved it!"}
{"text":"I dig this joint. It has good food for a reasonable price. My friends I always come here after a night of dancing or walking the Las Vegas Strip late night since it's open 24/7 and the Fireplace is absolutely nice and cozy. My favorites here are the Nachos & the Sampler. \"I always decide on those and I never go wrong with them!\" I recently had the wings here. They're a little salty, but not too much as to where you can't enjoy them so it's safe to say that I'd still recommend them. The cocktails are good here too. My favorite cocktail is the Scorpion here."}
{"text":"This place as been a family staple for over 25 years. As a child I looked forward to coming here on our vacations to LV and now as an adult the I still look forward to coming here! The spinach salad is incredible and is definitely shareable. The breakfast menu has your standard items so you can't go wrong if you have kids!"}
{"text":"It was just an average breakfast diner. Bug portions and ok service. Coffee was good and the toast was ok. Didn't like the choce of fruits, but hey whatcha gonna do?!"}
{"text":"The peppermill is DELICIOUS! It is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas for many reasons. I love the atmosphere, the food, and the portions! The decor of the peppermill is so cute and is very vegas-like. The waitresses wear old school diner uniforms and work their butts off! They are definitely priced on the higher end, but it's expected considering they are on the strip, it's a tourist attraction, and the portions are humungous. The only downside- this place can get very very busy and you may wait a while! It's best to go during the week or late at night to avoid large crowds and waiting. Otherwise, this place is awesome! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I gotta say - the restaurant part sucks.  The Lounge - much better.  

Although the food is hit and miss, it can be good.  Then other times, it can be cold.  Wait staff isn't always the friendliest, and last time we were there, they totally messed up our order, leaving us with mostly cold food because of having to fix the order.  OK, AND ON TOP OF THAT - they charge you for EVERY REFILL.  EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.  I was even charged for a whole other cup of coffee when I just asked to top off my cup to make the coffee hot again. So, what... ? They put in less then a 1/4 of a pour and charge me for a whole cup of coffee?  I don't think so. I have no desire to go back there again.  But...

The Lounge - cool vibe, the food seems to be better when it served back there (still can't figure that out) and the drinks are REALLY REALLY good.  We like to go to the Lounge with friends, especially ones from out of town.  

Skip the restaurant, go to Denny's instead.  Seriously.  The restaurant isn't all it's cracked up to be."}
{"text":"Is it a strip club or a Denny's on psychedelics? 

Honestly, what can be said that hasn't already been written? The Peppermill has a great atmosphere, decent food, and hefty drinks. I brought an out-of-town friend here who, like me, has an appreciation for the ridiculous and the brightly colored, which this venue has many times over with tons of pink neon lights and 80's music videos playing on repeat. 

We grabbed a seat just above the fire and water sunken living set, and were greeted promptly by a server. We ordered a few drinks and went with classic mozzarella sticks and the Sriracha chicken bites. The food was pretty basic, but I would recommend the Sriracha chicken bites, especially if you're just going to sip and snack. 

Beyond the normal vodka soda and martinis, we opted for the Scorpion Bowl. This juggernaut of alcohol and sugar is best served over ice, but if so inclined, you can add ice cream into the mix for that creamy dreamy diabetes fueled coma. The Scorpion Bowl was ok, but insanely sweet and definitely needs to be shared with a fellow boozehound. The bowl is great as a one-time novelty drink, but I wont be ordering this on my next visit to the Peppermill. 

Cheesy music, velvet couches, and neon lights. I'm there."}
{"text":"Always a favorite.  Never in my twenty years of living here was there a problem.  The food is consistent and service is great."}
{"text":"Gross so ughhhh yucky:( once we walked in they ask us do u want something from the bar we said no thanks we live here... Servers was nice food was grossssssss!! I just ate my toast and my bf was looking at me because I'm the one who wanted to come here lol servers was nice decor cool I guess but never again..I feel like the people that think this place is good is because they're drunk and they have no tastebuds lol but we was sober and boy it was horrible"}
{"text":"Was refused service because they don't allow hats even for those being worn by a female cancer patient - really sad they are so unbending even talked to management who said policy is policy.  I think they need to change policy."}
{"text":"Everytime we come to Vegas this is our spot!! We come for breakfast and sometimes even come back after hours!! We never ordered anything that wasn't good! Portions are soo huge big enough to share unless your a fatass!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant \"diner\" lounge experiences.  Great food and service with a  velvety atmosphere.  French toast was amazing today!"}
{"text":"Endearing.

You can't dislike Peppermill unless you're either 
1. a Grouchy McGrouchy Pants 
2. a rainbow and unicorn hater.

Who doesn't love neon rainbow signs? Who doesn't love indoor neon, old 70's dining table lamps, and rainbow sprinkles when eating? 

The basics: 
1. Affordable 24/7 diner with all-day breakfast
2. The menu is huge and overwhelming like Cheesecake Factory
3. While not fancy, this is just good, solid diner food done right. And big.
4. Happy Hour drink and app specials! Cocktail waitresses will take drink orders separate from servers
5. No split checks. Don't worry, someone invented Venmo for that.

Fun vibes and just a happy place to eat. Just a fantastic memory to add to any Vegas trip. Get the avocado BLT with the runny egg on top!"}
{"text":"Had the Marco Polo omelet with hash browns and it was filling and delicious. Eggs, spinach, diced chicken, cheese and hollandaise on top, Awesome!! Friendly staff and fast service. Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"I can't give this place a 5-star review because I was pretty darn drunk when I went. The atmosphere is great at 4:30 in the morning. When you are slightly about to have  a hangover and are just stumbling out of some afterhours club and are not ready to see the sun yet...this place is perfect. Go, grab a delicious bloody mary, sit by the fire fountains, or get a table. Order yourself one of their great 10-egg omelets (I ordered one that had crab and avocado in it). It is a great place to go with your friends to fill up on pre-hangover food and sober up."}
{"text":"I can't believe that once you leave the very family styled eatery of the Peppermill you pass the double doors and you enter a lounge that all that is missing is the strippers.. We spent 3 hours here catching up with my little brother, enjoying the cocktails and watching the couple behind us get to 3rd base, each seating area is secluded so there is alot of privacy. I will be returning again."}
{"text":"This place is adorable! Its like Dennys meets Kawaii. Its greasy spoon food - very yummy. They have a separate restaurant and lounge. If you come on a Sunday or holiday, make sure to come early because they get a line out the door. Its worth it though with the decor and food. The lounge is cute with fire pits and comfy couches. Not really ADA accessible in the lounge, but the restaurant is fine. If you like ice cream, order the sunday - but be warned it about 5 lbs of ice cream!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for brunch on Saturday between 9:30-12. We arrived for breakfast and they told us it was a 45 minute wait which is fine because it gave us the option to think whether or not we could wait or go somewhere else. We figured it would be 45-1hr and decided to wait. There were 4 of us plus an infant and the place was packed there's only 5 chairs to sit in and wait so you can imagine how there were people waiting everywhere. We stood against the wall for 55 minutes and I decided to go up to the host and ask how much longer. She told us it would be another 45 minutes. This is not ok. I told her we had already been waiting an hour and she explained she was sorry but there was a table of 20 waiting before us. That's fine however it's better to tell people ahead of time when they check in, that way we can make the decision of whether or not we want to wait. This is the second time this has happened to us. I saw the list she had written down it was one hour wait so I explained it was actually a 2 hour wait and she should inform people to give them a heads up. The only reason I gave two stars was because the times I have been here (about 4) the food has been great. The service is always ok, nothing awesome. I really like the tacky decor it's old school Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was amazing very huge portions and very nice staff I will be back again when I go back to Vegas! Great mimosas"}
{"text":"Love every thing I order from here! I get small oatmeal and its delicious. Eggs benedict...freaking awesome. Pancakes...yeah, you know it. So, I usually eat breakfast but I am coming back to update as soon as I order something from main menu...just don't know when I will get over breakfast yet.  Oh, and a full bar for breakfast...I love the grown-up version of Rainforest Cafe."}
{"text":"Oh my!  HUGE portions.  Cool other side with fireplace and dark cool ambience."}
{"text":"We were looking to find some breakfast in Vegas and wanted to try out a new establishment.  I had heard that the Peppermill was worth a try.  We decided to take a gamble and a short Lyft ride down the strip.  To best describe this restaurant in a single sentence, I would say it is a double-priced Denny's with slot machines. 

We walk in and ask for a table.  There is a 25 minute wait for a table but decide to be sat immediately at the counter in front of the waitress station/kitchen.   Our waitress was very attentive and our drinks never went empty.

We came here for breakfast and their menu had plenty of options.  I couldn't decide on what to get so I asked the waitress what they were known for/what was popular.  She didn't have an exact idea but said people like to get the country fried steak.  I said hey why not and ordered it.  My wife ordered the blueberry pancakes with sausage and bacon.  The food arrived surprisingly fast.  My food looked and tasted average.  The country fried steak looked like a big battered pancake covered in sausage gravy.  It was just too much for me grease-wise.  Sitting right in front of the kitchen I could see all the other customer's food waiting to be delivered and instantly regretted not going with a lunch option.  My sunny side eggs were alright.  My hash browns appeared fresh cut but were soggy.   I tried a bite of my wife's blueberry pancakes and they tasted great.  Fresh blueberries and such.  For her sides, she ordered scrambled eggs with cheese and her meal also came with a side of bacon and sausage.  

Overall, the food was pretty average.  The prices were kind of ridiculous.  My cup of coffee was $4.  My country fried steak meal was about $20.  My wife's meal the same price.  Overall, we ended up spending over $50 for meal that might normally run in the $20s range at a similar diner.  I could have eaten at Hash House for cheaper.  Oh well I learned my lesson.

Maybe I missed something.  Maybe I should have ordered lunch.  I just didn't catch the charm that was supposed to make this place special."}
{"text":"Decent diner fare in ample portion, though desperately overpriced (e.g., $7.50 fruit cup).  My chorizo & eggs was delicious.  Best time to go is what anywhere besides the Las Vegas Strip would consider normal weekday breakfast hours (e.g.,Monday 7:30am).  Otherwise, can be quite a wait."}
{"text":"Large portions, breakfast and the rest, 24hrs. Nice service moderately expensive. A New Jersey Diner transplanted on LV Blvd, but this one's in better condition."}
{"text":"Of all the times I have been to Vegas I was missing something.....I needed something out of old time Vegas, something flashy, gawdy, and cool not dirty  and cheesy like Fremont street and over the top like the strip. Then I found my oasis....Peppermill! I went here because I saw it on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations and I was in complete awe of the decor and the large drinks they had and what I thought to expect Peppermill gave more. 
It's a great place to have drinks with your friends away from all the typical Vegas stuff. The waitresses outfits are tasteful and classy  from what I have seen at Vegas which is a relief itself. 
First time goer and likes to drink get the Scorpion."}
{"text":"You definitely get the Las Vegas vibe when you walk into this place.  The blue neon lights every where is a tribute to the Las Vegas of yester-year.  We came here for breakfast and ordered a chicken fired steak, a classic Eggs Benedict and kids pancake for my four year old.  The chicken fried steak and the Eggs Benedict were good.  Quality you would expect from a good old fashioned diner.  The portions are pretty big even for american standards so come hungry.  Service was a little slow but all in all a great alternative to the overpriced resorts."}
{"text":"If you want that classic Vegas atmosphere while eating, this place is it.  Cherry blossom trees around the booths, mirrored ceiling, and crazy carpet make the whole experience great.  

Food-wise, it's not that bad.  It's typical breakfast food at any diner in Vegas.  Overall, a place to eat when you want that crazy scene while eating your meal."}
{"text":"I had their chicken Quesadilla, very cheap on their cheese :( hardly any...FYI to peppermill..Quesadillas are supposed to have cheese, I didn't return it because I was hungry and I didn't feel like waiting for a new one , but a quesadilla is pretty self explanatory ugh Cheese you cheap $@: duh...but plenty of sour cream and salsa, we had to ask for extra napkins, ketchup.."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this classic Vegas late night joint, but sadly B & I went for breakfast.  Ordered the Greek style omelet (feta cheese, spinach, etc.) and had hash browns.  

The hash browns were undercooked and tasted like warm frozen nastiness...& the omelet was totally undercooked with 0 taste.  

Sent my meal back & didn't have the courage to order another meal.  

Anyhow, if desperate, I would do late night run in like I do when I'm LA at 'Mels'; but not a fan (maybe just a bad one time experience).  

Service was solid and other customer's meals looked decent, so again shall give Ol'Pep the benefit of the doubt and say maybe I was unlucky...

I would suggest keep it simple sin city & order basic stuff here - the bacon was good! lol"}
{"text":"Solidly good quality food. One of the few things i truly miss about living in Vegas is the Peppermill."}
{"text":"Something happened to this place and I'm not quite sure what it is. The service has dropped, the food is not as good, and the prices have increased so that it's no longer a good value to leave my hotel. $7.90 for 2 coffees (not even Starbucks charges this). $17 for a turkey club sandwich with a sliver of avocado. Breakfast for 2 was $45 (no alcohol was ordered). When we mentioned our concerns to the manager, it was clear that she could have cared less. I've been coming since I was 14 yrs old. Guess what - I ain't comin' back until this ship turns around. What a shame; It used to be a cool local place and now it's just another tourist trap."}
{"text":"Good customer service, but my food was gross and tasted like dog food. I got the corn beef hash, my sisters and a friend got delicious meals, mine not so much."}
{"text":"Sigh... I love me some good diner food. We came in around 0130. We were seated right away. Around me there were a bunch of empty tables that needed to be cleaned off. Giving this place a messy/dirty feel despite what appears to be a recently renovated restaurant. 

The crowd is what you expect to see late night. The menu was pretty extensive with breakfast served 24 hours a day.

Our server was excellent. She was attentive and checked up on us appropriately. The food arrived very quickly. My husband got the sampler and I got the Lorraine omelet. The sampler was as nothing spectacular. The omelet was fluffy and not that flavorful. I subbed the home fries for French fries, but they came out so undercooked.

To sum it up... great service,  love that it is open 24 hrs... but the food was not good and I definitely found a long piece of hair cooked into my omelette. So grossed out. 

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The place was very retro, for sure. We went out on a Wednesday night at about 9pm. My husband and I both had great meals. I had the pancakes and eggs and sausage. The portions were huge, but I ended up having breakfast for the next day. He had a sandwich (I can't remember which one) and he enjoyed it very much. Other than a couple of surround tables' drama, we had a pretty nice dinner. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We ate here on 12/10/11 around 6pm. Gave this place 4 stars because the prices for some of the dinner entrees are outrageous, in my opinion, but I realize the portions might make up for that. My husband got the gyro sandwich that came with onion rings (huge onion rings), I got the turkey burger which came with sweet potato fries (and lots of it!) and my son had the kids meal pancakes with sausage (the pancake was humongous).  The highlight of my meal was the turkey burger. I think that was the biggest,  juiciest, best tasting turkey patty I have ever had. Yes the decor is cheesy and out dated but my son was in love with all the neon lights and my husband was in love with all the short skirted waitresses and massive cleavage of the cocktail girl."}
{"text":"2/16/14

this place is always great! ive been coming here for YEARS and its always consistent- good food and lots of it!

i got the eggs benedict, which is my go to. it was delicious.

i go to vegas at least twice a year so i cant wait to be back in august."}
{"text":"The food that we had was amazing but the service ... not at all. 

First it was so slow, secondly the waitress looks like she's very tired. It was our God-sister's birthday on that day and when asked if there's anything special, she said we can get the cake & she or the rest will sing it. We rather sing to here ourselves. The food came about 50 mins later without the garlic bread that was supposed to be there together. When we called for the manager to at least feedback to her what had happened, she said \"what will make us happy\"? So I said, comp the birthday girl's food. She did not do that but gave us 20% off. Anyway, we will not be back there again. :-(."}
{"text":"We dined at the Peppermill on a recommendation while in town. Enjoyed seeing a part of old Vegas. Service was great and efficient. We ordered the Maserati omelette, chicken fried steak and eggs, and a pastrami cheese burger. Portions were huge and the food was great. Just as good as some of the high dollar, big name restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Enjoy a refreshing bloody mary while you wait to have breakfast! Pancakes, eggs, sausage and hash browns were great! Recommend to add to your morning while visiting vegas."}
{"text":"We stopped by while in town for a convention. We were so impressed!

The waitress and staff were so friendly. They offer breakfast and lunch options all day long.  We get our food and everything was fresh, huge portions, and tasted SO good!! We had hamburgers which were filled with wonderful toppings like pineapple, avacados ect. The breakfast was great with the French toast option, covered in fruit and hot syrup.

Great restaurant option and so glad we stopped by!"}
{"text":"Went again for lunch and it didn't disappoint. 

I had the same thing as last time and it was just as good. I would have liked the omelette a little less watery but, it was egg whites and that can happen. My hash browns were cooked almost to perfection. Crisp and light. 
The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because the service was a tad lacking. It took well over 15 minutes just to have our order taken and then another 10 minutes for our waters to be brought out. Our waitress was busy though and our food came out fairly quick too so, this won't deter me from returning again and again.
I just think I need to try something new next time. I guess I can be a creature of habit, lol"}
{"text":"Biggest omelette I've ever seen.  Seriously, what's the deal with this five-egg monstrosity?  Even sharing it took two people two days to take that thing down.  I appreciate a large meal, but jeez.  The hash browns were great, not amazing.

The decor is garish and horrible but very Vegas and endlessly fascinating, so I guess it gets a pass.  The place was packed, and it was a bit slow, but who knows if that's the norm.  Pretty traditional diner food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice: once at about 3am and once at about 6pm. Both times the place was busy... Different crowds though. The food was good, service  was better at 3 in the morning, the place looks like Miami Vice meets the Flamingo Hotel from 40 years ago and I'm not sure why. If Dennys partied a little too hard and had a kid that was raised in Vegas it would definitely be Peppermill."}
{"text":"It's one of the few classics that doesn't fade away. I just had the pastrami sandwich the other day and it was excellent! I have not had a good pastrami sandwich since Old Ebbitt's Grill in Washington, DC. This sandwich was pretty darn close. On top of the one of a kind decor, Elvis was having lunch at the same time! This place is still top notch!"}
{"text":"***Just a warning*** Prepare to wait!!!
Came here on a Friday afternoon. The place was PACKED. We found a seat in the Fireside Lounge (luckily right in front of the fire). Service was slow and when the waitress did come around she would go MIA after the drink order was put in and when we asked for some of their honey peanuts (which we never got). I also had to flag down multiple people to ask why the waitress never brought back my debit card when I gave it to her 20 minutes prior. Only when they tracked the waitress down was my card processed. Also, I highly recommend paying with cash, as they placed a $34.50 hold on my card, for god knows whatever reason, that didn't fall off until the following WEDNESDAY (5 Days) after my initial visit. I can understand if I had asked to leave the tab open, but I had them close it out immediately. There was no notice or warning that they put holds on cards.
The drinks and food are good. Portions are HUGE. The waitress on the diner side was very nice and fast. 
Would I come back? Sure, but I'm going to bring cash."}
{"text":"After watching the much anticipated star wars the last Jedi on christmas we needed food. But where do you go? So thankful to find that the peppermill was open. The portion sizes were huge i could have split my club sandwich with 3 people depending on the hunger factor. The coffee was good, the herb chicken sandwich juicy and flavorful and the fries crisp to perfection. I was rather impressed because its a fairly average older establishment with allwalks of life coming in and out of its doors, but they even sold me on atmosphere. Each group was given their own little booth in this very bright blue and neon signed room. I will be back to try their colossal sized cocktails and larger the average banana split!"}
{"text":"I go for breakfast on the weekends and it's always great, good service and big portions , also perfect after a long night on the strip try the Biscuits and gravy then home for
 some shut eye."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go after my night out!!! It is 24/7 and always crowded and cool interior. 
It is one of those place with huge portions and good food!! I come here every time when I'm visiting!

They will take a picture for you and your group as a souvenir! And of course you can buy the bigger print but they give you a small one for free!

My favorite has to be their hot chocolate with whipped!
I'm not sure why but something about their hot chocolate always warm up my night and wakes me up. 

Their breakfast food is a must here!! Hash brown and omelet! Huge portion ,amazing price and yummy too! Burger is also decent! Meat is juicy and comes with many sides. 

For those who are looking to grab some food after a night out or early morning brunch. This is def the place to go!

I'm hoping to try out more of their food when I go!! But will def come back!"}
{"text":"This place brings back fond memories for me. When I was a kid, my dad and all his guy friends would meet for breakfast at the Peppermill the first or last Saturday of the month. It was my first experience of being out with the guys, feeling cool and I wish I could bring back those days. 

I'm here to say that it hasn't changed all that much. The waitresses are still wearing shiny nylons, but they are a lot younger than I remember, which is definitely a good thing. The food is good, the portion sizes are GIANT and you could easily order breakfast and share it with another friend or significant other. 

The service here was very good. Coffee cups were never empty, our waitress checked with us numerous times throughout the meal and they even had a cute gal come around and take your picture, which obviously means she comes back 12 minutes later while you have hash browns and eggs all over yourself asking \"Wanna buy your photos? 2 for $29.99 or one for $14.50.\") That's not such a bargain hun.

Peppermill is a much better option that the hotel buffet, which at the Wynn (where we always stay) would have been roughly $35 a piece."}
{"text":"Perfect brunch spot! A Bloody Mary in the lounge while you wait for your table is the ideal Vegas experience! I chose the biscuits and gravy and they were SO delicious. And the chicken fried steak rivals the best I've ever had. Can we go again tomorrow?"}
{"text":"In Vegas for the weekend and tried this random place to eat . I have to say they have a lot of options to choose from. I got a Peppermill cheese and bacon burger with sourdough bread it was okay.. not the best the bread was way too hard and the food was cold. My boyfriend on the other hand got a country fried steak with hash browns and he said he would give it 3 stars. It was good because I was hungry but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Must stop for breakfast while visiting Vegas ! It's usually our last bfast before heading home."}
{"text":"A very weird vibe here, but the food is awesome and reasonably priced, and the quirkiness just adds to the Vegas charm.

I came in on a random weekday evening to grab a quick dinner. The first thing I noticed was the low, neon lighting everywhere. My attention quickly moved onto the skimpy retro style diner attire all the waitresses were wearing. It kind of gave off a bizzaro \"Hooters\" feel. On top of all that, I had arrived at 6 pm, apparently the tail-end of the early bird hour, as the median age of the clientele appeared to be approximately 82. Ah, Vegas. Where else can you see a retro neon hooters full of octogenarians?

Onto the food: I opted for the Philly cheesesteak with onion rings, and it was tasty, freshly prepared, and HUGE. I downed everything on the plate, but I had no regrets. My sense of accomplishment was only enhanced when I got the check. This place is a winner, folks."}
{"text":"Usually a 24 hour restaurant, I usually think of Denny's. Mainly a little less then average place, just to have something to eat and not much to really look at, except the other booth of people around you. But Peppermill, proved me wrong about 24 hour restaurants, and looks more then an average place. Now this was an ideal 24 hour restaurants, that I wish it could take over Denny's. Then I would be coming there all the time. 

Located next to Riveria, its a very colorful restaurant on the strip. Of course I had my doubts about going here, but glad my wife twisted my arm and go. Outside, it may look a bit unsure on cause its close to downtown. But despite the fancy looks that you can see on the outside, inside, is a whole different story. The seating is not like no other picnic table booth, its basically a curved booth with nice, colorful seating. You don't have to worry about being smooshed against the wall anymore. Each booth is like curved like the letter \"C\", all over the restaurant. It has very nice lighting, and very wonderful arrangements, like your in the rainforest. Not like Rainforest Cafe, but a bit less elaborate then Rainforest Cafe. 

The staff was wonderful, we were seated right away, we were served drinks, once we were seated. Our waitress was very nice as well. They all wore colorful uniforms and made the place interesting. She always made sure that we were okay. 

Looking over the menu, the pricing was a bit more then I expected. But once I got my food, I can see why. The food was in big portions. I ordered the New York Steak, and ordered it well done. I was amazed that it came out well done. I mean, no pink what so ever on that meat. Usually when I order steak, it doesn't seem well done, but this time around, it was. Made me think about next time I come here, I should order medium. I don't mind pink, but I thought like any other place I had a well done steak, it had little pink. But I really did enjoy my New York steak. It did come with a salad, and it came big. Also came with Onion rings that were big. Mainly everything was big, even my wife's coffee cup was big. As much as I wanted to try to finish it, I couldn't. I came so close though. Finish the salad, the steak, but threw in the towel with 3 onion rings left. 

If your looking for a place to eat in the middle of the night. Peppermill will surely not disappoint. The pricing may be more then usual, but its well worth the price, especially when everything comes at you in big portions. Very well recommended 24 hour restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't do drugs. But if I did, this would be my restaurant of choice while in Vegas. It looks like a box of demented crayons teamed up with a glitter-pooping unicorn to stop the invasion of Barney the dinosaur.

Four stars."}
{"text":"2 visits in a week, it's that tasty! My 86 year old father loves this place- huge portions, fairly priced."}
{"text":"First off I wanna warn my fellow Yelpers NOT TO PARK ON NORTH LOT, tow zone not by peppermill. Now for my review: I'm HUNGRY!!!! As im waiting looking around, everyones food looks so good and hefty portions. The food is SOOO GOOD!!! I got egg Benedict and 1 pancake, my hubby had the corned beef and hash. 1 OJ and water. Service is spot on. Decor is very colorful, even sugar is colorful. Will be my place to come for breakfast in Vegas for sure.  Bill was $37 and have left overs."}
{"text":"In love with how retro this place.  I felt like I was in a fancy limo restaurant mixed Denny's with all the neon lights and the fake trees.  It's tacky but awesome at the same time.

They have a very extensive menu so they basically have everything to cover your needs.  The service here was pretty good.  Nothing to complain about.  

Southern Fried Steak and Eggs: Lots of gravy just the way I like it.  They cut the potatoes differently than other people but it was crispy.  
Gyro Sandwich: Maybe it was drunk me but it was probably the best gyro I've had at night.

I would totally come back here again.  Plus it's open 24/7."}
{"text":"Since, this place was the nearest and had the best ratings on yelp from the location where I was staying on the strip this is where I ended up eating my SATURDAY Breakfast. 

The wait time was 30-45 minutes for a group of five people. I believe we waited longer though. The bar inside the restaurant had no wait. But, you could only order appetizers as food entrees. The inside of the restaurant looks like a rave or a strip club.  The neon lighting is pretty epic. The staff was very friendly being that this place was super packed with people waiting inside and outdoors for a table. 

The Menu was a little overwhelming -- it had a big selection to choice from. So, what ever your probably craving after a long night of partying.. they probably have it on their menu. Everyone in my group had breakfast entrees... We all seemed to like there crispy hash browns. Oh... Did I mention the colorful sugar on the table? Yes, there sugar for coffee looks like confetti. Super cool and colorful, just like their dining area."}
{"text":"Only 4 stars because one of the waiters was not great I asked him what is the specialty here, since it was my first time! He said, \"American\" ummm really! then the buss boy said were you looking for mexican food? Umm no!! That did it for me!  The food is delicious and they serve huge portions...Coffee was always warm it could of being a little hotter in my opinion."}
{"text":"Take about beeing full. The line out the door. This place is pack with lot of people. The waitress was nice go are food rite and fast. Will be coming back agend. The good thing it's next to where I was staying."}
{"text":"love the food but the service here sucks 100% unless ur sitting at the bar the server don't really care about service ......our server sam never ever checked on us got our order wrong and when we let someone know she waited umtil the manger came and droped off the check to say sorry she didnt care at all ....the manger mary is a sweet heart she seem to be doing the server's job....wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"The fireside lounge located inside the peppermill was one of our stops to go to on a bar hopping experience I had. We came around 10 which is happy hour on food and drinks. The lounge has one big fire pit in the middle of the room and everything is neon and blue velvet. It's a fun place for drinks and I would love to return here."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot since we don't have a huge appetite and don't want to splurge $40+ bucks on a pricey buffet.  This is the place to go if you want a good price, large portion & delicious meal.  Their omelettes have 10 eggs, so this gives you an idea as to how big a portion they serve.  My recommendation if you don't eat a lot, split it.  Also, if there's a waiting time go to the fireside lounge through the glass doors if you're 21+ as you can order cocktails while you wait and the waiting time won't seem so long."}
{"text":"The best hot wings and curly fries on this side of the Mississippi!!!! It was amazing grace!!!! I'm from TN and was visiting and I will be back next month!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The pancakes have won again! The omelets will always conquer! 
The Peppermill is always a great place to eat, from 2pm to 2am! 
If you haven't been here before, make a stop here!"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ cheddar burger and it was amazing, I asked for extra BBQ sauce and they brought out warn BBQ sauce .  Shoutout to our server Hiromi she was amazing."}
{"text":"Old Vegas style , great food we love to go late nights for a bite"}
{"text":"There's really nothing exceptional about this place, but it does represent an anamoly smack dab in the middle of the otherwise sordid and overpriced strip.  Comfortable coffee shop vibe or an average but comfortable cocktail lounge is the gist of it."}
{"text":"So, I've been doing business in both these places since before most Yelpers were born (about '86) as well as at the Algiers restaurant and lounge which were immediately to the north.  I chuckle when I see people give this place less than 4 stars because someone didn't honor their existence or because Bobby Flay didn't prepare their meal on their one visit.  This place is remarkable not only for enduring as one of the last of the old Vegas but because the service, portions and quality have all remained consistently high throughout at least the last 30 years.  They've tweaked when conditions necessitate but haven't really changed what they do because what they do is provide great quality and value without caring what trends dictate at the moment.  Pretentious? Go somewhere else.  Got friends and wanna hang?  Try the bar or restaurant, you won't be disappointed.  Hope they stay around another 30+ years  ;-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I split the ham & eggs. 
Ham was huge!!! Unfortunately we sent it back because it was dry and sour. We were afraid to eat it and get sick on vacation. The ham ended up being a country cured ham and our palettes are not used to the salty/sour notes of the ham. Peggy comped it and got us chicken fried steak instead which was excellent. The sausage gravy is flavorful. 
Hash browns-bland, needed salt and pepper. 
Soft scramble-they were good
Wheat toast-came pre buttered and was good 
Peggy gave us excellent customer service to make our meal right. Extra star for Peggy."}
{"text":"I was referred by a friend. Probably the best recommendation I've gotten for Vegas.

The place is awesome. It's all booths. All the staff is constantly moving. 

The food is beyond delicious. I got the biscuits and gravy. The best I've ever had. I couldn't stop eating.  I didn't need to add anything to it. Flavor was perfect. The biscuits were perfectly soft

The staff came back many times even though they were super busy. I will definitely be coming back on this trip and every trip in the future.


The wait wasn't bad, 15 minutes, honestly I'd wait as long as it took. Worth the wait for sure. They have slots and a lounge that you can hang out in until they call you."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about the Peppermill but I've avoided going because I don't really like diner food. My mom and I finally made the trip last night and although the food isn't anything special, the atmosphere and service was pretty awesome. On the outside it looks like a Sizzler. On the inside, it looks like a retro Vegas hotel bar. We decided to get drinks in the bar instead of being seated in the restaurant. As soon as we sat down a regular (I assume) told the bartender he would buy my mom and I drinks. I ordered a martini and the bartender asked everything from what type of vodka I wanted to shaken or stirred to what garnish I preferred. Stoli, shaken, olives. And I got 3 olives at that. We played video poker at the bar while 90s and 2000s music videos played on a TV at the center of the bar. It was relatively quiet on a Tuesday night but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The bar only serves appetizers so we ordered the sliders and 10 hot wings. Again our bartender asked us a series of questions about which condiments we wanted with our food. The sliders were standard, but with surprisingly cold patties for how slow it seemed in the restaurant. The chicken wings were better and the sauce was perfectly spicy. I wouldn't consider Peppermill a legitimate dining option but would definitely come back to the bar. It was a lot of fun listening to the waitress' drink orders for their tables. Some of the highlights: White Russian, Colorado Bulldog (White Russian with Coke), and Hawaiian Sunrise. The bartender knew his stuff and wasn't phased by any order coming at him. I'd do this experience again anytime."}
{"text":"A nice throw back to old vegas, with the mirrors neon lights and 'fire pit' tables.  
It's not associated with any casinos and while there are a few slots it's a pretty quiet spot open 24/7

The menu is large and the portions are huge, well worth the walk up the north strip (though maybe not at high noon on a 110 degree day - I almost died)

Get there between 3-6 and have at their insane food and drink specials in the lounge."}
{"text":"Very popular and big servings. We all split our omelets and pancake combo. It had 3 big pancakes, 3 eggs, sausage, and bacon. 
Food was good, service too and splurge on the picture a photographer takes at your table. One comes free and you can buy bigger versions."}
{"text":"This place is a local standard.  Back in the day it was the place where all of the topless dancers and all nighters went at the end of their day.  They have always had a good menu and the food is good as well.  It is no longer a locals place. I took 3 guys here for breakfast the other day and It cost me 60 bucks. I was a little surprised but I guess they have to keep the lights on.  Being on the strip is a big plus for the business but they are no longer the only place open all night  so I guess the locals have found a different hang out.  I will still go here when I am feeling nostalgic but the price will keep me from being a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"Every since I moved to Vegas I have been wanting to try The Peppermill Restaurant. Last night I finally got the chance to experience this place. Some of My friend couldn't make it to my wife's birthday dinner celebration so we decided to get together to make it up. 
I liked that The parking lot is huge, plenty of parking for sure. Once we walked in, it felt like I stepped right into the 1970's. There is a foyer where a hostess is there to seat you. If there is a wait you can always go to the fireside lounge that's located inside Peppermill to the left of the restaurant side. (It's open 24 hours ) unfortunately The place had a stuffy smell it almost smelled like throw up,  that was a very off putting smell to experience before your about to eat. Plus the restroom were very dirty and close to the foyer. 
Our booth  was directly behind the hostess podium on the other side of the glass so we kept getting random whiffs. 

Hiromi was our waitress she was very friendly. And understanding when We took our time  choosing our orders we started with mozzarella sticks. My wife ordered the California Burger, I ordered the BLT&A with curly fries, my friends ordered the Peppermill Burger, Peppermill Pastrami Burger And the Fresh Fruit Salad. 

Service was 100% amazing. the food was so good and generously portioned. My BLT&A was so big & packed with bacon and avocado. I got the mayo on the side but didn't use any, because the sandwich was great just the way it is. 

My three star review is based on the rank smell and dirty restrooms . plus we thought it was weird that we had to wait in line to pay for our meals . it took us even longer because we had to split the check. And to top it off we had drinks added to our check we never ordered. It wasn't an issue but the fact the our waitress had to be called over to verify took us even longer to pay for our meals."}
{"text":"Old school Vegas, 24-7 hours of operation, neon, 80's music blarin, and BTW, this is a diner.  Great breakfast, lunch menu with HUGE portions. Bonus=indoor fire pit and lounge seating in the back bar. LOVE this place. This makes hitting the dreaded Las Vegas strip (tourist trap hell) worth the meandering in. Think the movie \"Casino\" and you have a true mental image."}
{"text":"I've been to the Peppermill for breakfast and lunch multiple times now, and have enjoyed this casual place with a menu with something for everyone.    The item I've found myself getting repeatedly is their Cobb Salad......which is huge and delicious.

I like the diner type atmosphere as well.   In the past the wait hasn't been too bad, but when we went there for a Sunday lunch around noon the place was packed (45 minute wait?)."}
{"text":"I don't give 5stars easily. This place was SO good!! My husband and I shared the fruit fantasia waffle & munch's breakfast. So delicious!! The waffle was covered in fresh fruit and came with a delicious sauce that wasn't too sweet. Munch's was equally as good. Totally recommend this place & worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"They delayed our food order for some specious and unconvincing reason. I have a special-needs stepson who did nothing but moan and groan about not getting his food. I will never come back here, ever again."}
{"text":"My only issue with this place is the front hostess. Not customer service friendly. People in front of us put their name in then the girl walked away started talking to another employee who saw us but never said we'll be right with you or even tell the girl she had other people waiting to be seated. She finally came back to the desk, never made eye contact, continued talking with someone else then finally looked up and said very firmly, what's the name, with out even a hint of a smile almost annoyed that she's working here. Other than that, food is good and wait staff is friendly. Peppermill, you need to work on the friendliness and first impression of your front desk help."}
{"text":"hmmmmmm hmmmmmmmmmm
this place is always packed.
so either accept the 30 min wait time or leave!
clean bathroom.
pay-for-internet kiosk..
little tv sized gambling monitors.
nice staff.
open kitchen.
now i wouldnt necessarily call the decor vintage as in 1940s art deco, but yes, it is vintage vegas kitsch.
comfy spacious booths.
good coffee in big mugs (thank god)
& even though its not sugar free.... they have...
COFFEE MATE vanilla creamer!!!
full bar available..
eggs benedict & potatoes around $10
french toast under $10
(yes i ordered both. but i gave my taters to my bf)
i kinda sampled a bit here & there from everyone at our table, & everything was delish.
definitely coming here next vegas trip.
oh, this is at the north end of the strip. 
theres a Ross next door in case you forgot to pack your strapless bra..
we walked from the hilton over here w/o complaining"}
{"text":"The Hubs and I went for breakfast this past Saturday morning for breakfast. The wait was about 30 minutes which was just fine for us because it allowed us to go to the bar for a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary's were very good and the bar is fun and eclectic.
We were seated in a booth in the middle of the restraunt and that made for some good people watching. Our server was prompt and friendly in taking our order and bringing water. There is a cocktail server walking around taking for your cocktail order. The menu had a lot of choices for breakfast,lunch and dinner. Food was good and atmosphere was fun and swanky. If you like fun and funky I recommend the Peppermill."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. The food was pretty good. My Mushroom & Swiss burger was a little greasy. For the price, it could've had more mushrooms. And the mushrooms tasted canned but they were still good. Hubby loved his burger. He got the Pastrami Burger. The onion rings were amazing and the fries were good too. 

The waiter seemed new. Was super friendly, maybe a little tooooo friendly lol but he was okay...

Food wasn't super hot/fresh when we got it, but nothing to really complain about, we were hungry! 
We would go again. 

You'll spend at least $11-$13/meal"}
{"text":"Food: average. Service: slow. I don't understand the hype. I came on a Thursday around 5. It wasn't very full, but it took a while for the waiter to get to me and take my order. It took a while for the cocktail waitress to take my order. The salad tasted generic, the bread was good, the beer was cold. I ordered a medium ribeye, but it came half medium well and half well done, even dry. The potatoes and veggies were average. Even with all the waitresses walking past me and looking at my table, none of them got my empty plates or refilled my water. It took a while for them to cash me out because the machine kept malfunctioning. The couple ahead of me gave a $5 tip for a $60 meal. While I never give less than 15% unless services are terrible, I don't blame them for that low tip. It was really poor service."}
{"text":"Miniskirts and objectification are never out of style in Vegas.  Hooray!

One of our cabbies mentioned something like \"Yeah.  Forget about eating on the strip anywhere other than Peppermill.  Everyone local eats there.\"

It's marginally better than the $15 slop you get in most of the dives on the strip and well worth the trip.

Open 24/7 like everything else, so feel free to drop in shitfaced."}
{"text":"An experience for sure! The portions are huge, the food is delicious, the drinks are strong, the scene and design are something to see. This is where both the \"Average Joe\" and the \"Hollywood Celebrity\" eat and are satisfied with all of the above mentioned."}
{"text":"We first came here ten years ago.  We haven't been in Las Vegas since then.   This is the only restaurant that we actually remembered.   That is how memorable the experience was.

The restaurant is conveniently located in Las Vegas Blvd.   There is plenty of parking that is free.

The restaurant is decorated in retro style.   It is surprisingly clean, although the carpet definitely could use updating.  I dogged the faux trees and flowers.

The food was very good.   My kids had a waffle, that was loaded with fresh fruit and delicious, and my eldest one had a tasty burger.   We were pretty disappointed with the $13 shrimp cocktail that had 5 shrimp.   That is over $2 a shrimp, probably the most expensive shrimp I had ever had.  I that is why I took one star off."}
{"text":"This is the place where i always take friends and family when they come to visit...and it WOW's them every time. Good food, great atmosphere, totally cool firepit bar. No other place like it in Vegas."}
{"text":"This restaurant is mostly for tourists but I still like to come here and battle the crowds since the food is really good. I like the atmosphere here and food is made pretty quickly. As a local it is one of the better restaurants around."}
{"text":"I came twice first service was horrible three ppl came to take my drink order which I didn't receive for an hr ppl being sat after me where getting there food first...just craziness when I first walked up to the hostess she yawn rite in my face eww...so later that day my sister wanted there crab cakes so we went back and a \"MANAGER\" named JOANNE came to tell me to cover myself because I was wearing a bathing suit and before I can be seated she ask three more times until I said give me a minute to sat down my belongings... As I was telling the hostess about my horrible service that morning she goes to tell me because I wasn't getting dressed fast enough and was complaining about the horrible service she refused us and didn't want to serve us...so I was being punished for there horrible service smh I'll never go back...My husband is part owner of the drais club and we'll be telling anyone who listens to never go there"}
{"text":"I love this place. If you are visiting Vegas or a local this is a must. The environment is trendy and fun. Portions are huge so be prepare to share or take some left overs home. They also have this really cool fire-pit bar area where you can chill have drinks and appetizers while sitting in front of a water fire place. Another favorite thing about this place is their colorful sugar! So cute."}
{"text":"American Breakfast Rules!
Hint: split a biscuits and gravy since it comes with a half dozen biscuits and a cup or two of gravy
Crab Eggs Benedict was phenomenal
and so was my regular eggs over medium with breakfast sausage. We also split a side of bacon to make sure we could not be revived after our heart attacks. JK'
Be ready to wait an hour during peak times. If you don't have the patience go somewhere else. 
Watching all the lushes suck down morning booze was also entertaining."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast before my bf & I drove back home.
I'd never heard of this place before, and never really seen it before even though it's so close to the Strip. My bf said he's been coming to this place for years so I guess for those that know about it, it's a legend. 

Why would anyone bother going to Denny's when you can go to the Peppermill?! 
Food was super fresh, I had a veggie omelette that was gigantic and perfectly fluffy. It seriously had to have been made with at least four or five eggs. Sadly I couldn't finish it, especially since it also came with toast and I got fruit instead of potatoes. Mind you, this was good fruit, not just some grapes and a slice of melon. It was more like a mini fruit salad along with all the other food! 

I must say, I have a special place in my heart for the kind of gaudy decor (fake plants and pink flamingo lamps) that awaits you at The Peppermill. The waitresses all wear cute little outfits and are super friendly, seemed like they've probably worked here since it opened.
Apparently there's also a nice fire pit in the other room, which I didn't get a chance to see. It's open 24-hours too so, of course, I am a fan. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town and I'd love to see what they have for dinner..."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. And this place has made me very upset. Apparently this place will cater to pimps, and hoes. And drunks waking in at 3am. But when you, a normal human being trip and fall one time this place won't want you back. Better not waste your time if your sober and fall. This is a terrible place to come. Don't spend your money. Find a better coffee shop to go to. This place has lost my business forever. And if they treat everyone like crap, I hope you all won't go back."}
{"text":"I'm averaging out my scores between service and everything else.

I have to say the food was good - I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with potato salad as the side.  The drinks were good as well and, although the one I ordered had no price listed, I found it reasonable.

The atmosphere was fun - lots of bright lights and funky uniforms for the servers.  With everything stated above, I could give the Peppermill 4 stars, HOWEVER....

The server took FOREVER!!!  We were there for dinner and, although seated immediately, were there for nearly two hours.  The server grabbed a box for me to take the remainder of my food home in, but didn't think to grab the check at the same time?  After that it took forever to flag her down... and even after she picked up the check it took her ages to swipe the credit card.

Although I enjoyed the food, the service absolutely killed it for me.  It was busy there, but by no means THAT busy."}
{"text":"This place is really cute and cozy. It is outside of the hotels and totally worth trying. The portions are pretty big so prepare to eat. The food is pretty good and the staff is friendly. We come here every time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is awesome! So my family came here last night in celebration of my mothers birthday. We asked her to choose any place she wanted to go eat for brunch and this is what she wanted. No five star fine dining steak house as we normally do this year. She wanted something much more casual and breakfast lol. What better place than the Peppermill. I was a bit caught off guard because I haven't been to this place in YEARS! I forgot how good it was. When we arrived it wasn't even busy and we were able to be seated immediately! The hostess was very friendly and helped us find a big enough table for 6 including a chair to sit my baby niece in. I also forgot how cool the ambiance of the place was with the neon lights and old school diner style tables. The outfits of the employee's are so cute it's so funny to see them walking around especially the cocktail or beverage girls. Not quite sure what they are called officially but either way it's cute! 

Like many have already raved about.. HUGE PORTIONS! I checked the pictures on Yelp prior to arrival and I had my taste buds fixed on one of these crazy big omelette's. It was more so in the evening dinner kind of time and I thought it was funny that my family all was in the mood for breakfast food. Except my nephew (teenager) just had to be different and get a sandwhich lol. Anyways let's get to this food! Yum! Since this was a family affair nobody ordered anything off the cocktail menu, and yes I know me of all people stayed sober and stuck with my water haha! Oh but believe me when I say I will return and take advantage of their daily happy hour! The drinks here look so fun and colorful. 

Entree's

Mediterranean Omelette w/ bagel and cream cheese

Marco Polo Omelette w/ blueberry muffin

Veggie Omelette w/ Lemon Cranberry muffin

Country Fried Steak w/ mashed potatoes and veggies

Conquest Sandwhich

Conclusion from the entire family was we all enjoyed ourselves to the max!"}
{"text":"We didn't really eat dinner. After running an errand super early in the morning, we all decided to grab breakfast. We arrived on Friday, May 12th around 5:45pm. My party of five was seated right away.

*Bacon and Eggs: three farm fresh eggs (scrambled hard) served with four slices of bacon, hash browns and your choice of toast ($12.75) ×2
*Eggs Benedict: 3 poached eggs (poached medium) on grilled Canadian bacon and toasted English muffin, topped with hollandaise sauce, served with hash browns ($14.25)
*Joe's San Francisco Special: traditional classic of scrambled eggs with spinach, pork sausage, ground beef and onion, seasoned and served on crispy hash browns and smothered in a golden cheese sauce, served with wheat toast ($13.95)
*Maserati Omelet: a superb omelet bursting with sausage, jack and cheddar cheeses and mushrooms, smothered in a perfect italian meat sauce, sprinkled with parmesan cheese, served with hash browns and your choice of toast ($13.95)
*Side of Bacon: 5 pieces ($5.50)
*Coffee ($3.50) ×4
*Pepsi ($3.50)

I got the Joe's special. I always order this when I go out to breakfast, so it was nice having a Vegas twist on it. I liked the addition of the cheese sauce. I don't always like potatoes, so I kinda wished they didn't put the whole scramble on top of the hash browns. I was able to eat around it though. I tried my friends maserati omelet. I adore meat sauce, so I enjoyed this twist on an omelet. Tasted like spaghetti bolognese in breakfast form. I also got a side of bacon cuz I adore bacon. A good size as it came with five pieces.

I didn't know this until a friend told us, but apparently this diner has been featured in quite a few films, etc. I thought it was a cool little bit of trivia. I didn't recognize it, but one of the more prominent films mentioned was Casino.

Good place to go if you're super hungry as their breakfast portions are huge. I could only finish a quarter of my plate. They have a nice varied menu, so there's something for everyone. I heard there's a fireside lounge area of Peppermill as well. I'd love to come back and check that out."}
{"text":"Great food. Not too expensive. The best chicken parmesan I've ever had. Unusual lighting technique inside."}
{"text":"The place smells, also I went on my birthday and heard the manager talking to a guest about how his birthday was the day before and the manager gave them a free alcoholic drink. Cool until I showed her my I'd and said it was my bday on this day  n she didn't offer me anything!!  I felt so stupid!!!!! Whatever!! Will never go back here again!!  Alcohol Drinks tasted watered down! Terrible device!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and huge portions-good for sharing. When we r in Vegas we always make a point to stop here. Come here when u are very hungry : )) Purple Rain colors inside decor...fun fun"}
{"text":"Good classic old school diner.. nice big portions and the food was fresh. The restaurant had a nice style to it not to busy for being in Vegas on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Its a Vegas landmark. Everyone in the nightlife industry comes here after work, 5/6am for breakfast.
HUGE portions, but rather pricy for locals. But its a retro diner type, it has an intertesting decor andthe food is ok. 
Service is a little slow at times.

Come around 2/3 am and its full of drunken tourists :)"}
{"text":"This place is no better then a Denny's and they charge twice as much. Food wasn't good at all."}
{"text":"Huge portions await you! Sadly for you but yummy deliciousness for me this was my second visit and second time devouring as much of the Country Fried Steak and Eggs as my belly would hold! The hand breaded steak topped with homemade sausage gravy truly makes you want to slap your mamma. Who would think a diner in Vegas could perfect the ultimate southern dish? This is served with 3 eggs, toast and hash browns for just $15.25 but be hungry, very hungry!!!!!!

The interior is so welcoming with bright neons yet trees, flowers and greenery throughout. The service both times has been excellent. Each time we had a 15 minute wait so be prepared and they did seat us in less which is a complement to a well run restaurant. Nothing is worse than a \"hangry\" guest being told 15 and it being 30!!!! That doesn't happen here... The menu is extensive and they are open 24 hours so take time from the casino and enjoy a great meal here."}
{"text":"VEGAS HEAVEN. The most giant nachos I've ever seen in my life. I wish I had known about this place much, much sooner. They also serve CoronaRitas because THEY CLASSY.

Servers are super nice to all the drunks (like me) and they have the patience of saints. I can't wait to stumble back in there in a state of total inebriation and starvation. Open 24 hours, of course. 

Love the Peppermill!"}
{"text":"This place has lots of character and some killer deserts. 
the food is a little better than Denny's but nothing amazing. But really you go here for the experience of old Vegas. Mirrors on the ceilings and trees inside whats not to love"}
{"text":"I've been here a half a dozen times over the years. Every visit was a pleasure.

The god is good and the drinks are excellent. You'll love the ambiance in the bar. It's the perfect place to take a date."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place in Vegas! Vintage Vegas ambiance, delicious food (huge portions), crazy 70s interior decor. And next door at the Fireside Lounge there's a liquid fire pit and either music videos or sports on dozens of TVs all around. Bonus trivia: Joe Pesci stabbed that dude in the neck with a pen here in \"Casino\"."}
{"text":"This place was great. The staff was so nice. A photographer was there that took our photos and printed them out for us. The food was absolutely delicious and the portions were VERY generous. We didn't finish our meal but as soon as we got back to our hotel, we scarfed it down. The decor and atmosphere was very soothing with the blue tones and the seating is very comfortable because every seat is booth style. Open 24 hours and a great place to dine in LV."}
{"text":"This place. I had heard about it being a staple in the Vegas community when I lived here last year, and I'm glad I got to try it! The food was incredible and GREAT portions for the price. The decor is perfectly Vegas. The lounge was beautiful! The place was packed but I called ahead for.my Party of 14 and we were seated 20 minutes after arrival.

Our table's favorite dish next to the giant pancakes was the Sin City BLT that came with an overeasy egg and pesto sauce. Please try this place on your next trip!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is a definite must! The portions are huge! The 3 pancake breakfast was enormous and soooo delicious!!"}
{"text":"Nice place to head after dinner or a night out. Music sometimes a little too loud, but decor is vintage and cool!"}
{"text":"If you want a quick place to eat and not walk through an entire hotel this is a spot that you may like, i.e. Dennys quality.  Some gal on my SWA flight recommended this place for its steak. I should have put my headphones on and toned her ass out.

Everything looked OK, quick service, huge portions THEN A GIANT ROACH heading for our feet underneath the table.  Thank God my husband saw its huge antenas and he stomped it out.  No joke, the busboy paused to watch him do it and just kept walking on.  I am terrified of bugs, but this roach was a healthy sci fi thriller type roach who ate a whole rib eye in the back before coming out to the main floor for seconds.

Pay the extra $10 and go to Outback down the street!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy my visits to Vegas with a stop at Peppermill. Food is always good and plentiful and service has always been good. We love the breakfast here."}
{"text":"It's cool if you want to eat breakfast in a place that looks like a strip joint. The food is pretty but not a place I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Not the experience we read about. Sat night at 7:00  there was no wait to the place was not nearly as busy as expected which would have been good but were in Vegas and expecting to sit fireside which we never even saw the fire. We order our food and 20 mins later are told the meal my husband ordered was sold out. A cocktail waitress which inconveniently is the only person you can order drinks from never came back with our drinks and when all was said and done they still charged us for my husbands meal that's was sold out and made us moss our Uber because they had to correct it and take the charge off. The menu is really not as impressive as most reviews say on top of that the prices are outrages for excessive food you don't need to take out on the town with you."}
{"text":"If you're staying in Vegas, or live here and are out on the town, forget everything you think you know about late night/early morning drunk breakfast. IHOP - haha, forget about it. Denny's - gross. Peppermill Lounge - perfect. When you walk in the lighting and decorations will make you happy, it's like an 80's night club with trees. Every member of the staff was friendly and patient. The food was perfect for the moment, yummy stuff. I got the Joes San Fran Special, which was filling and delicious. The prices are just right and the timing of the whole meal was on point. This should be the after after party spot for all club goers! Trust me , read my other reviews, I'm legit. ;) . Done"}
{"text":"If you like neon lights, fake tropical plans, bright velour cushion sofas, a fireplace coming out of water and some damn strong and excellent frozen mudslides (this is coming from a guy who would rather drink bourbon!), THIS is your place to go, especially at 7:30 a.m. If not, go for the breakfast.  =)

Service kind of lags in the lounge in the morning, but the restaurant is jumping already with lots of patrons who've been gambling, going to strip clubs, doing what people do in Vegas.  In the late evening, the lounge is crowded and service is much better."}
{"text":"We went because of the high recommendations. I wish we would have walked out as soon as we saw the tacky decor. Each meal is large enough to feed an entire family if that family wants a low quality meal. They definitively stress quantity over quality.  I suggest passing on this one."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas to celebrate my brothers' birthday.  I was told you can't come to town and not come to the Peppermill.  This spot was everything and more!!! The drinks and food were beyond AMAZING !! The portions are out of control!! You better come hungry....but you will STILL take home a doggie bag!! We had mimosas and breakfast. Service was outstanding from the bar area to the dining  area. A must visit spot when in Vegas!! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab food 24/7 when you are hungry for more then fast food  when in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Classic diner... Just more expensive. Food was just meh. The Fireside Lounge was nice, but they didn't serve full menu on that side so we went into the diner side. I would go back just because it is The Peppermill or for the Fireside Lounge part, but it isn't a place I would write home about. Service was definitely lacking. Our server was very strange and his mind was obviously not on work. Kind of felt bad for the guy."}
{"text":"late night or anytime this restaurant host some of the best food you can eat that is reasonably priced in Las Vegas. They also have a sister restaurant up in Reno. I have been to that would many times also. So if you're on the strip and looking for a hearty breakfast dinner or lunch this is a great place to try."}
{"text":"During the cab ride in from the airport I asked the driver if he had any restaurant recommendations. He suggested Peppermill and described as a Denny's on acid. I thought he meant that you would have to be on acid to go there at first but then kept hearing other people suggest it as the best place to fill those late night cravings. Finally I made it over there and was I happy about it. It had the perfect late night laid back dinner feel to it. The staff was friendly and the food was decent. Definitely worth heading back!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Love this place. Great food, better value. Atmosphere is great for kids. Good service, the table photo is a bit goofy, but the food and price makes up for everything. Burgers, chicken....awesome"}
{"text":"This place was pretty great - went in March for a late brunch and the food was excellent. I really loved the funky old-school style of the place including the sparkly, multi-colored sugar in the sugar dishes. Only complaint was that the cocktail waitress took incredibly long to come to our table - my boyfriend actually got up from our table and ordered from the bar because she was taking forever to make her way. Of course once I was waiting for him to come back she then came to ask for our drink order which was no longer needed. The Hawaiian Sunset Mimosas that he brought back were really something else though, definitely the best mimosa I've ever had. Really all of the drinks they had on their menu looked great and the fact that the menu showed pictures of them helped to decide on what to order. Despite what happened with the cocktail order I will definitely be back the next time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"What hasn't been said about this place in the 1000 other reviews?

Yes, their food portions really are that big. Yes, their food is amazing and reasonably-priced. And, yes, you can drink here at any time of day or night.

I ordered the onion rings. Most places would give you a manageable portion size. Not here. In typical Vegas fashion, they gave me a trough of onion rings. And they weren't small onion rings. They were massive, breaded, greasy -- just perfect. I must have eaten 5 whole onions.

I highly recommend The Peppermill."}
{"text":"Ehhh not what I expected at all. The images made this place look really interesting but once you walk in it looks like a hot mess! The service was slow and the food tasted like frozen food. I would never come back."}
{"text":"everyones said it. yes tacky but satisfying food for those late/early morning hungry clubbers. i think the lounge is pretty cool actually. kinda has that austin powers retro fire spitting feel good vibe. i dont like bloody mary's but my husband said they make it really good here. can't expect much.. but from your options in the whee hours.. i think this place rocks!"}
{"text":"What a fun place! You can play with the sugar on the table while you wait for your yummy food to come, plus theres a full bar to keep you going. The food is great and atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast. The portions are HUGE!! Everything was delicious! Cooked to order and fresh. I would recommend splitting a plate!"}
{"text":"Honey This Place Delivers All the Way Around!!!! The Inside is Very Unique! Excellent Customer Service! I had the Mediterranean Omelet On Point! Definitely can see why this place was featured on the Food Network!!! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you recognize the Fireside as soon as you walk in, you've watched too many episodes of Blind Date. 

The Fireside was the meeting point for a large group of people. The pretty girls in their tight low-cut dresses took really good care of us, even the one who was getting trained. (Wow...I'd hate to be trained on a group like the ruffians we were!). 

Martnins were small, but the big drink things were HUGE and perfect for sharing with 10 people. Get the one without the ice cream.

It's a fun dive with big fluffy couches, a fireside lounge (literally), tiled mirrored ceilings and fake flowers and vines separating seating areas. 

Didn't eat at the Peppermill, but I can attest to the total fun-ness of the Fireside Lounge."}
{"text":"i came here expecting to be disappointed. as another patron put it \".. this place looks like a strip club!\" 

i ordered the conquest sandwich and it was surprisingly tasty. can't really go wrong with roast beef, cheddar, bacon, and peppers. the bread had a nice flavor too! onion rings were piping hot and crispy. the price was very reasonable by vegas standards and the service was decent. i'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is a Vegas landmark!!!!  Great atmosphere and very clean for a 24 hr diner !!!!   5 stars on cleanliness!!!!  The Crab cakes are a must try,  cuz they were the favorite on our order  !!!!!! We also had a burger and was done pefecrtly !!!  Will come again to try breakfast items."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, very Vegas! We were sat fast with 10 of us and had plenty of room. Our waitress was great and everyone enjoyed their meal. Good size portions and fair prices. Oh and some pretty cool sugar for your coffee :)"}
{"text":"I don't often give five stars, but the Peppermill definitely earned them.
Ten in the morning and place was comfortably full.  I was greeted immediately and seated. I got an excellent chicken fried steak with three eggs. Everything was just the way I like it- crispy, rich gravy, eggs just right.
Brenda was cheerful and attentive, with frequent visits."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast joint in Vegas. Unique atmosphere, the staff is great and you will not walk away hungry (they give you huge portions). My personal favorite is the Maserati omelette."}
{"text":"It's kitschy and that's what makes it fun! The food is decent, not mind blowing mind you but good!
A bit pricey but the portions are big, hot and fresh! I had a gyro plate which came with two full Gyros and a good size portion of delicious crispy and hot Onion Rings!
The omelettes are huge as are the pancakes and deserts!
The Fireside Lounge is a must as it just screams old school Vegas! If your in Vegas and on that end of the Strip, definitely worth a stop in!"}
{"text":"We arrived here about 3am and it's exactly where I needed to be. I got a front row seat next to the fireplace and while my stomach was growling and my head spinning from the cocktails earlier in the night... I was completely mesmerized by the fire and all the blue pink neon. It's sooooo 80s. I love it!

The food was okay. Nothing special. But... the atmosphere is awesome especially if you've got  a buzz on. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The pepper mill was delicious. Huge portions, the pancakes are the best I've ever had and the chorizo and eggs were delicious.

The pepper mill was delicious. Huge portions, the pancakes are the best I've ever had and the chorizo and eggs were delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent!!  I feel like I went back in time to old vegas.  The service was great , food was yummy and the portions were HUGE.  It's an old part of the strip but don't let the area keep you from going in."}
{"text":"I always like coming here- lots of good things on the menu, breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night-- and consistently good service. It's casual, and has lots of interesting people coming in, just like Vegas itself."}
{"text":"Peppermill is popular amongst the Vegas clubbing crowd. I have no clue what this place would be like at regular hours of the day, but think Denny's or The Pantry. The prices reflect that of the Vegas markup too, but you come to expect that on the strip. The first thing that you would notice on the menu would be the breakfast emphasis. I've only done breakfast here and it's rather good, even at 4 am.

-=-Southern fried steak-=- I got this meal with eggs. That's the perfect way to do chicken fried steak. It's definitely top 5 in my list of chicken fried steaks. You just can never go wrong with a fried piece of steak. The gravy that they add on top as well is savory, flavorful, and not too overbearing. If you want something breakfast meaty, and don't mind a huge chicken nugget, get this. I was able to get away with only eating half, and saving the rest for later, so fear not hungry men, this will fill you."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast because of the good reviews and wasn't disappointed. The portions were generous and the food was good. The decor screamed Las Vegas but it added to the fun. Everyone went away happy, will definitely be back.

Since the initial review we went there for lunch. I had the Reuben with Onion Rings. The Onion Rings were excellent, big, sweet onions with a very good batter. The Reuben was good as well. My wife had a chicken sandwich that she was pleased with and fruit, which was very good. Sometimes fruit can be iffy, melons especially. This fruit was all ripe and sweet. A nice lunch"}
{"text":"This review is just for the restaurant. Portions are ridiculously huge (my fettuccine Alfredo was legitimately  larger than what I'd serve a family of 4, but I mean, it's Vegas), the booths are a little uncomfortable, and it's super chilly (bring a sweatshirt!). Totally fine, but I'd say probably not worth it to come just for dinner. Will try the lounge next time, though!"}
{"text":"Came here during Peak brunch time on a Sunday and had to wait about a half hour. This went by pretty quick because we was able to go sit in a booth in the lounge area and really check out the Retro glamorama of this place. To eat we ordered the biscuits and gravy which was a little bit of a let-down, the gravy tasted flowery and not enough kick and the gravy itself so it was the least favorable thing we ordered. Next we had the New York steak and eggs, decent size cut of meat and we'll seasons with a massive side of eggs and hash browns with a blueberry muffin on the side all delicious. Finally we had the Joe's San Francisco mess which is pretty much just a scramble top with cheese sauce with a side lemon cranberry muffin on the side. I think I will come back here just to eat muffins and coffee those two things were really a standout. Our server was incredibly fast and very tentative to our table as well as the hosts were doing a good job of turning the tables over fast. If you're on vacation this is definitely one of the cooler diners I've ever been to so you should definitely pencil in a breakfasts here before you leave town."}
{"text":"Gigantic portions for hungry people coming out of the club. We were seated quickly. Our server was very sweet but was totally overrun. They had her manning so many tables. Felt so bad. We ordered a French toast collage, Southern fried steak, and Buffalo wings. Food came out a lot quicker than it took to take our order. Massive traditional American diner meals. Best fried steak I've ever had. Honestly. The neon lights helped us transition from club life back to real life. Solid late night option near the Strip."}
{"text":"Think of this place like a Denny's with a sexy 80's attitude. 

It's basically a diner with vegas flair. When you walk inside it's dark, there's pink and purple neon lights and fake plates everywhere. It's usually packed but you won't have to wait long for a seat. The service is pretty quick, and the staff is nice. 

Food is great, large portions at a reasonable price. Exactly what you would expect from a diner. 

The lounge area of the restaurant is cool, it's got a very swingers vegas feel to it. Large velvet couches and a indoor fire set the mood for relaxing and making out haha. 

I didn't try any of their drinks but they looked like they had a nice selection of cocktails. 

All in all this is a fun place to go for late night drinks and food or morning breakfast or lunch. I'd be returning soon next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Las Vegas strip has a little gem of a place with this restaurant.

When I arrived, I thought, \"Ok, maybe this is just like another burger or steak place like Applebees or Chili's\". 

Walking through the doors though, was a whole other world. It definitely resonates Las Vegas.

In the reception area you will discover slot machines, mirrored walls with lots of blue and purple neon lights outlining the different segmented areas.

On the right side of the restaurant is standard seating for groups, families, etc. decorated in some nice greenery.

As I walked towards the entrance to the left of the restaurant, that area is known as the Fireside lounge.

Throughout the lounge are circular table settings with a fireplace in the middle. The atmosphere reminds me of what I would imagine of the early heydays of Las Vegas. It was appropriate to dress up to the nines and hit the town and I imagine this lounge to be reminiscent of that era.

I was there to enjoy some drinks with my other Zapponian co workers and we ended up ordering some food as well.

The wings were good but I'll be honest, the drinks took a little long to arrive. I ended up opening two tabs and ordered from the bar.

Other than that, I had a great time.

If you want to lose yourself and find a themed restaurant, put this on the list to visit, it's on the strip and it perfect for something different and yet a bit intimate."}
{"text":"Perfect kitschy, greasy spoon. Will make this a regular stop in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Peppermill previously but this is my first review. 
Arrived at 10 AM and the place was doing a brisk business. There were only a few unoccupied tables and we were seated immediately in a comfortable booth. Service is top notch from being seated to the end of the meal. Our server followed up periodically. The veggie omelet was large and comes with hash brown potatoes and a choice of toast, muffin or bagel. My omelet was perfectly cooked. The veggies were al dente and the eggs fluffy. The hash browns crisp on the outside and soft inside. Just a great breakfast.

Being from the northwest side of Las Vegas I would not drive here to eat but if you are in the area or to bring some out of town visitors, the Peppermill is the place to eat on the Strip."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a Vegas staple. If you don't know that now, you should. This place is always packed. The key here is being patient with the long wait times. 

The restaurant itself inside is, um, unique. But it's the uniqueness that makes it memorable. It's completely dark, and neon, and looks very much like a diner right out of the 1950s. Gaudy decorations, but hey, it's Vegas. 

While you wait, enjoy the actual fireside lounge in the bar area. The bartenders and cocktail waitresses are friendly. 

As for the food, it's delicious. Usually you don't complain with 24 hour breakfast. Everything is delicious, you won't go wrong here. 

If you willing to wait a bit for good old fashioned American food, this is the place to go on the Strip."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with a few friends, this is real a great spot for couples groups if your looking for a relax chill spot with good drinks it's about a block from circus circus and a block from the Wynn. They have fire pits going and waitresses that keeps the drinks going, flat screens and all in here it's one cool place I got to say it's not a large venue but a cozy one."}
{"text":"I've been several times now for breakfast, lunch and drinks. Atmosphere is vintage Vegas kitsch - neon, mirrors, indoor fake trees. 
Breakfasts are very good and portions are huge. They have a variety of omelets, all huge and cooked well. Pancakes, also huge and done well. I order the hash browns extra crispy and they always get it right. 
For lunch I like their Reuben sandwich. 
I haven't had a dinner their yet. 
Every waitress that has served us has been very friendly and service is always great. 
The Fireside lounge is a retro vegas throw back that is pretty amazing, for what it is - miles of neon, zilions of little mirror tiles on the ceiling, velvet booths, flaming fountain conversation pit, cocktail waitress in long black gowns, good drinks. The appetizers in the bar are a mixed bag - decent bar food, some good some ok."}
{"text":"So many choices! No matter what you're in the mood for, pepper mill has it. Their menu is huge and has everything from breakfast to turkey dinners. Their drink options are extensive as well. 

The atmosphere is very different from most diners. It's very dark with neon and velvety purple colors. Very cool 

If you go, try the Belgian waffle it's really good. 

Also, their giant fruit platter is amazing. Like ENORMOUS and it comes with a loaf of AMAZING banana bread. You also get like 8 scoops of sherbet. 

A must try if you ask me."}
{"text":"Ahh only in Vegas! Who cannot love this iconic colorful back in time restaurant that is fun and open 24/7! I love the breakfast here! The ham steak is the best I've ever had. It is tender and tasty and is not overly salty. The portions are huge. My ham pretty much took up the plate! They offer an extensive menu for breakfast, lunch ans dinner. The drinks look delicious and are huge. Next time I must try their bloody mary."}
{"text":"This place is just THE BEST,. A very old well kept tradition and very Vegas.. Large portions, kitchy kool wait staff always a great meal at a reasonable price... Beats the buffets hands down.. no contest. Fireside is great too!"}
{"text":"Nice stuff, food was outstanding at a reasonable price. The drinks were strong just like the way I like it."}
{"text":"This is a fun colorful restaurant. If u like breakfast food, they have a lot of choices."}
{"text":"A request for a mushroom and cheese omelet  with hash browns and eggs , beacon and pancakes . 
Both meals cooked to perfection . The staff and service very professional.
The restaurant , clean and inviting for all ages. Thank you."}
{"text":"I love that my experience at The Peppermill was so different than what many others wrote about. 

We stopped in for an early morning breakfast after a late night in Vegas. We must have walked in at just the right time because we were immediately seated in this very eclectic, gaudy diner. The waitress attire varied between what looked like a 80s throwback soda girl outfit and a 90s style prom dress. Hilarious and awesome. 

Families were sat around us, no drunks, no rowdy people--as others have mentioned. And the menu was a classic, American diner reprieve from fancy or over-the-top touristy stops. Me likey. The prices were a little high for breakfast-fare, but again, this is Vegas. 

Their eggs Benedict was the absolutely delicious and featured a split, well-toasted English muffin, topped with THREE poached eggs and some super-solid hollandaise sauce. And by \"super-solid\" I mean just classically delicious. No overly-powerful lemon punch, just well-balanced, rich goodness. Those hashbrowns were also off-the-charts good with fluffy and crunchy spots. I topped mine with Tabasco and loved that some of the yolks and hollandaise dressed the sides of the 'browns. 

An honorable mention goes out to the coffee! Smooth, awesome diner coffee. 

Also, this place doesn't look like it's changed much over the years, and really, that's part of its charm."}
{"text":"Good food, decent drinks, nice servers and good price. I had the French dip and it was worth it. Unfortunately,  the person checking us out was very rude. She was bad mouthing our group of 5 right in front of us to a coworker after she messed up splitting our check and gave us attitude about it. Very gross."}
{"text":"Got the key lime pie martini w/o cream. It was pretty gross. But I love the cheesy atmosphere of this place. Prices are fair and staff was very nice"}
{"text":"I was in recently for breakfast. When we arrived there was a wait but it went by fast. The portions at this place are huge so bring an appetite or plan on sharing your food. I kept it simple by having ham and eggs. However this ham steak was a 16oz monster slab of meat bigger than my head. It was grilled and tasted great very salty with a touch of char from the grill. It came with 3 eggs and hash browns. Both were good and exactly what you would expect. Everyone else at our table enjoyed the food they got as well."}
{"text":"This is one restaurant that my husband and I are always recommending when we have visitors. Love the retro atmosphere and the food is amazing! We've been for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have been happy every time. The portions are HUGE so it could be worth it to split something. The omelettes are phenomenal as are the cocktails. Great place to check out while you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat on The Strip.  You get big portions for cheap.  Most places on The Strip cost an arm and a leg for a good meal.  The menu is huge too.  You can get breakfast, lunch, or a dinner at just about any time of day.  However, be prepared to wait, whatever time of day it is, you will more than likely have to wait for a table.  And the service is ok.  But the food and prices are worth it."}
{"text":"this place doesnt look like much from the outside so i was pleasantly surprised when i walked in. it looks like the inside of a tour bus with the fabrics, neon lighting and seating. its very kitschy but in a good way. prompt service, waitresses in short costumes (it IS vegas)  and good food 

try: the eggs benedict: three poached eggs on an english muffin with hollandaise sauce, two petite asparagus and hash browns. bonus: pepsi is served!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place! Definitely have to stop by if you're in Vegas. Love the decor and the atmosphere of this restaurant. Was told a 30 minute wait, but was seated in 10 minutes. Came for breakfast but filled us up for lunch too! Huge portions. Nice big coffee cups which is nice. Service was friendly, busy restaurant so don't expect 100% attentiveness. Fairly inexpensive as well, and they serve alcohol."}
{"text":"The staff is polite and helpful. The portions of food are giant. The Philly cheese steak is delicious and the curly fries are even better. The decor is interesting but suiting for the restaurant. It's a fun place to go and have a good bite."}
{"text":"The Peppermill Restaurant is worth going to. I love the scenery. The food is delicious and everyone is pleasant."}
{"text":"This is like a Denny's on a whole other level!

We went here for brunch on our last day in Las Vegas.  On our way there, we were trying to decide what to do with our time in between the restaurant & the airport but that all changed when we stepped inside.  It was packed, like sardines in a can packed!  This restaurant is on the end of the strip, across  from Circus Circus so I was surprised to see how popular it was!  

For Sunday Brunch, our estimated wait time was 45 minutes but they said it could be longer.  You can wait in their Fireside Lounge where you can order drinks or if there is space, play a few slot games in the front.

After waiting close to 45 minutes & our names not anywhere close to being called, we overheard someone say that the bar served the full menu & is open seating!  What!  So we ran on over & immediately got served.

They have such an extensive menu, basically everything you can think of for breakfast, lunch, & dinner.  All of their meals are huge!  I would definitely share or come extremely hungry.

Mud Pie Ice Cream Cocktail?:  Very good!
Eggs Benedict, served with hash browns:  Substituted for regular bacon.  This was a hearty plate!  Your traditional eggs Benedict but with 3 eggs!  A heavy load of hollandaise sauce. 
Chicken Fried Steak, served with hash browns & a blueberry muffin:  Hearty!  I loved the muffin, so moist.  What killed me was the slab of butter for the muffin!"}
{"text":"Oh so wanted a benny for breakfast and after reading the reviews and seeing the photos I decided to walk a mile and half to this place for breakfast. It's really cool and the waitstaff is super friendly. I felt like I had been time warped to a Vegas way before I was born and have expected to see a hung over Elvis dining there. The food was good and with the prices so outrageous on the strip this was more affordable. My benny wasn't the best I have ever had but I enjoyed the moment in a funky environment. The service was fantastic-and I wondered how is the waitress so perky this morning- I had too many champagne cocktails at Absinthe and Fizz the night before. Viva Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Would have been 5 stars, but it took too long to get a drink. They have separate servers for cocktails, and we had to ask 3 times before one came to our table.

Food is EXCELLENT and servings are HUGE!!!

Decor is perfectly gaudy....lots of neon and fake plants!

This is a favorite of mine in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Walking into the Peppermill is a throwback to old vegas.  Its where you could invision Sammy Davis Jr or old Blue Eyes to be hanging out for breakfast or a late night snack.  Peppermill is away from the hussle and bussle of the mega resorts but sits conveniently next to the Riviera Hotel with its own easy access parking lot right off the strip.  I came here with a friend's suggestion for breakfast and it was a refreshing change from the overpriced, small portioned offerings in the touristy casinos.  

Peppermill has HUGE portions, I ordered the pancake combo for $12.99 which consisted of 3 pancakes as large as a dinner plate, 3 eggs, 2 bacon and 2 sausage.  Not only is this a great value price wise, but the portions are probably double of what you would get elsewhere.  My friend got the chicken and spinach omlete made from 10 eggs!  It was a monster of a dish and delicious at that.  The customers seemed to be a mix of vegas locals and tourists but the vibe was comfortable and inviting.  Service was excellent and attentive.  Would definitely come here again next time I'm in vegas.  Oh, forgot to mention they are 24 hours and offer a full bar, nice!"}
{"text":"The decor is awesome and the service was good, but the place was two or three bucks overpriced on every item and I thought the food was nothing special.  The eggs and hash browns were super buttery, which is not my thing at all, and all the alcoholic drinks were at least $8 (and were pretty small).  Its not a bad place, it just did not live up to my expectations as to price or quality of food."}
{"text":"This place looks very retro disco 60s-70s. Not my choice of ambience. The omelets were rediculously huge. So you definately get a lot for the money. I ordered the mazzarati omelet. That meat sauce threw it off, it tasted like spaghetti meat sauce. I would give it another shot I just didn't like what I ordered."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Riviera, so this place is basically the closest restaurant not in the Riviera food court. I had heard many things about the Peppermill - it was old, it was basically Denny's, you had to wait forever, etc. I still wanted to try it out, and I'm glad I did!

It is old. It's more of a relic of 80's Vegas. The Fireside Lounge is really cool, but very smoky. Not that great of ventilation. 

The food was hit or miss, but the portions are so big you really don't care that much. Or you are probably drunk like most people in Vegas. Just make sure you get something you REALLY like because you are going to have a lot of it. Like, maybe the biggest portion of your life. Peppermill makes Chipotle look like a joke. 

I say come by if you are on that side of the strip. It's a fun place and your only meal of the day if you play it right! The only con is there is always a wait."}
{"text":"Great because it was open. It's like eating at a strip club with no strippers. Low quality food. Drink first."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. My family and I always go and have a late breakfast here and we love it. From the people watching to the food can't get enough. The plates are for sure without a doubt big enough to share but I can't really complain about one meal I have had here. We go all the time and still have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Cheesy as heck, but kid friendly with quick service! Excellent buffalo wings, southwestern chx salad not so much! Drinks were good but more expensive than they needed to be."}
{"text":"Annoyingly large portions but the food has been surprisingly great every time! The atmosphere has a Disney/strip club feel and they have a photographer to take your photo."}
{"text":"Why oh why oh why don't we have one of these in Cali???? Screw Denny's. At the end of a drunken night, this hits the spot so good. The portions can feed an army and my friends and I were debating if the place used to a strip club with all the lights inside, but hey, its Vegas right??? Food was delish and our waiter was nice. I also really love the history behind the Peppermill, made me feel really special to be there. Gonna make this a regular spot when in Vegas."}
{"text":"For what it is it fills a niche spot on the strip that also brings back nostalgic memories of the one at Serramonte in Daly City, CA.  When growing up in the late 70's, it was one of our go to spots for large portions of good comfort food, and busty, statuesque cocktail waitresses in flowing gowns.  Man, I remember the colored sugar in bottles on all the tables too...

There are no more Peppermills in the Bay Area, but this one still survives and is a throwback to that seventies diner.  Yes it's ghetto and cheesy, but think of Denny's, Carrow's, or Norm's but with big booth seating, neon lighting, and chrome accents and that's pretty much the way it was.  The colored sugar is gone, but the portion sizes are still decent.  I don't think I would come here to order steak or pasta, but standard diner fare is fine...

That said we had:

- The Peppermill Burger w/fries;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=nS6W0CdWP3Wd7CR9WKqkQA
- The Swiss & Mushroom Burger w/onion rings;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=l2N9_HOlwejbZodafUdzKw
- The Reuben sandwich w/fruit cup;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=c5ZgwLXL2S4FVSqU2Czkfw

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=77R2zAj7PfGnm3vU4G7BJg

The soup and salad comes with the Rosemary bread but only offered a tossed green or spinach salad, so for a little more, I added the soup of the day to my burger and gave it to my daughter so that she could have her soup and salad with a Chicken Caesar instead...
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XXW_OFaYQkkGOGniujZFHg?select=ETvzWnTaDmgHQ2kk_cUx4w

The food is nothing spectacular, but the service was even and attentive, no problems throughout...

I once talked to the concierge at the Bellagio for dining recommendations, 'where do the locals go?'  I asked.  I think he oversold this place because he told me then that this was where all the strippers and showgirls went.  HAH!  Maybe that's why I always see hairy truck driver types in wife beaters hanging out.  Then again, it got me interested in coming here to give it a try.  Open 24 hours, I would come back for diner food, or dessert, or breakfast -- even though I've never seen any stripper or showgirl quality patrons, or even any leggy cocktail waitresses for that matter..."}
{"text":"Real good breakfast, the wait was long on this Saturday. Worth it though. We sat in the lounge which resembles a strip clip, but it isn't . But served drinks while we waited our 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Every diner should be like the Peppermill. It's has its own parking lot which is and nice and can give you a gauge on how busy it is. 
I was there during the week or breakfast so it wasn't too busy but I heard it can get busy there. 
The Lounge is to the left and the restaurant is to the right. It's a diner, Vegas style is my best way to describe. I didn't go into the lounge but I did notice a bar right inside. Of course there are the slot machines by the door as everywhere in Vegas. 
The restaurant is great. All the seating is booths or counter tops. Classic diner style. The counter you can see the food be prepared and can you track your food as it comes out. Breakfast was great. Portions were huge. I didn't quite finish my meal. 
Service was great too. Just enough attention. 
There are TV's hanging throughout the restaurant portion as well. 
They are open 24 hours and the menu is diner options, breakfast, sandwiches, hot entrees, etc. I only had the breakfast but I'm sure the food in general is pretty good here."}
{"text":"Wowzers!  The portion sizes are enough for a small army. We split a meal prior to the Rock n Roll Marathon and glad we chose that. Saw a man order the French Toast Ambrosia and I think France declared toast bankruptcy.  Great food."}
{"text":"Out of all the years I've been coming to the Peppermill it's been the same ever since I love this place but tonight tonight for some reason there are about 15 to 20 beautiful knock dead gorgeous women here they don't know me from Adam or all they want to do is go out and partay I'm down for that taxi all later O"}
{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets at the end of the Las Vegas strip. Great food, good prices, and a pretty awesome environment. Had to give this place a review after eating here on almost every one of my visits to Vegas. Try their nachos or their buffalo chicken wrap. Also, take the picture they offer when you're sitting and waiting for your food."}
{"text":"Huge portions of food friendly service a bit cold today. Bartender James on the fireside lounge makes a great Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for breakfast. Got there before the rush so we had no wait.  Ample servings.  Food was good. Service was fair."}
{"text":"We arrived here at around eleven for brunch with another couple, party of 4. The place is packed so be ready for a wait. The wait was an hour, not terrible. 

I went for a traditional breakfast, pancakes, bacon and eggs, with a side of hash browns. I could only finish half of my pancakes, portions are huge as everyone says. The pancakes were good, hash browns crispy, no complaints. It was a basic breakfast, flavor wise nothing above and beyond. Like I said though huge portions for those with huge appetites. Perhaps if I ordered something less regular I would have more to say about the taste."}
{"text":"Fireside lounge is the affordable, best lounge you have!

Great food, even their French fries tasted yummy... Onion rings, brushetta, chicken wings, nachos (order them with low cheese, they are very generous to pour a pound of cheese)... Love the seating arrangements, Quick service, good looking waitresses ;-)"}
{"text":"The food is always reliable. I have been eating here for years. It can be a little pricey but if you know what you want to get you can save $$$. Massive portions here. I had the gyro sandwich with onion rings. Two pitas with gyro meat, tzatiki sauce and pico de gallo (tomatoes and onions). The onion rings are huge and tasty. My wife and daughter shared a Mud Pie was also enormous."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's my 4th time here and it's kinda become a tradition to eat lunch before heading back into LA. All the servers and cocktail servers are pleasant. While waiting for our table we went into the lounge and had cocktails by the fire pit. Best Bloody Mary in town, honestly!
We loved our lunch today. Corned beef hash was amazing. I don't remember the lady's name who was our server, she had blonde hair, probably in her 50's? She was awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome food that is served in massive portions. The atmosphere was great and the decor was colourful. A proper American diner experience. The menu is limited if you are vegetarian but if you're willing to be imaginative the staff are more than happy to make adjustments according to your taste. I'm partial to milkshakes and the peppermill did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here more than once over the years, and can say it has great food and a wonderful aubience.

The Fireside Lounge is a very romantic and relaxing place to kick back and sip on drinks.

Love their Irish Coffee."}
{"text":"Cute kitchy Vegas at its finest.  Huge portions.  Their omelets are yummy.
Must-eat for out-of-town guests.
Oh, and one time I saw Todd Bridges (Willis from Diff'rent Strokes) here, so maybe you'll have your own D-list celeb sighting when you go!"}
{"text":"This is classic Vegas if you think, 1960s and 70s. Neon lights and a very glitzy atmosphere, you almost expect a floor show with your meal. And the food is fantastic! We had totally ignored this place on past visits. I believe we discovered it while passing by, on our way to the nearby Ross store."}
{"text":"I love this place and have turned many people on to it. Designed the portions are spectacularly large but also great tasting. Don't come here for spicy food but please try it for comfort food. 
The decor is out of sight and must be seen to be appreciated. The wait staff, female all from what I can tell are dressed in short, short suspended skirts and white blouses and white tennis shoes. Combined with the numerous artificial trees, designed mirrored ceiling and generous use of neon all make the place very memorable and unique.
A little hard to find as they don't have a sign on the strip but we'll worth finding."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! I looked this place up in YELP but was a little scared of the neon lighting and drinks shown in the first couple of pictures ONLY because I was traveling with my husband and our eight month old baby. Thought it would be more of a lounge than a restaurant. But I asked over at the Wynn where would they recommend a great restaurant for breakfast and they mention \"Peppermill\". I was then convinced and headed over. When walking in you can't help but see the neon lights and the purple furnishings. But once you actually sit down and your food comes to the table you enjoy the ambiance with the delicious food. Very good, would recommend and come here again!"}
{"text":"This place always has amazing food the wait is long at times but totally worth it. Drinks at the bar or at the table are amazing. Great service and warm and friendly environment. Kid friendly and a great place for the family."}
{"text":"vegas makes me do crazzzzzy things..

like driving to vegas at 3:00pm on a school night with a girlfriend
like over stuffing myself with five plates of food at the buffet
like meeting some random girls in a bathroom and ending up on a vip list to tao
like unconsciously finding myself seated in a restaurant filled with bright funky (bright neon pink) colors, plastic-covered booths, tacky lights and beads at 4:30 am
like ordering myself a peppermill omelet with turkey breat, cheese, and hollandaise sauce at 4:30am and clearing the plate with no shame
like leaving vegas at 5am to head home just in time for work

this place is a tacky but friendly old-vegas 24hr eatery open to in-town and out-of-town drunkards, hookers, and vegas goers."}

Bottom line: visit the Peppermill for a drink not a meal"}
{"text":"Super rad place in Vegas! The atmosphere is something else- beautiful and full of color. Pictures don't do it justice! The food is good especially if you're hungover or looking for some comfort food. I've never been to a place as fun as this. If you're in town, this is a must."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place and don't know why we don't come here more often when we are in Vegas.

This review is in two parts, the restaurant and the lounge.

THE RESTAURANT

Mirrors, fake Cherry Blossom trees, red and blue neon... what's not to love?

Service here is very good, prompt and friendly.  Proportions can be ridiculously large!

On the night we went, we had plans for later in the evening and I didn't want to be too full... so I was a little concerned due to the size of their servings.  I ordered the cheeseburgers sliders which came with home made Yukon Gold Potato chips.  The sliders were... sliders, nothing spectacular, but the chips were awesome though I could not finish them.  My wife had the chicken pesto sandwich with onion rings, both of which she LOVED.

We returned a couple of days later for breakfast where I had the country fried steak and eggs which was good, though again I could not finish it (and I am a BIG eater) and she has the French Toast Ambrosia... which was ridiculously large!  It was so big a lady from the next table asked if she could take a picture of it!  

I also noticed the gentleman across from us ordered the fruit plate which was not at all a fruit plate, it was a produce bar stacked on a plate!  I am not kidding, your could easily get your full eight servings of fruits and vegetables in one meal!

This place is a little pricy, however in most items you get enough to make two (if not more) meals.  Proportionally speaking it is very reasonable.

THE LOUNGE

We freakin' LOVE this lounge!  Again chrome and mirrors, red and blue neon, red velvet booths, and a fire spewing, boiling water fire pit!  I have always thought this would be exactly the kind of place where swingers would meet up prior to their assignations!

The waitresses all wear cocktail dresses which are very nice.  They prohibit you from wearing hats of any kind calling it their \"dress code\" but there are always people in there dressed in shorts and t-shirts so I am not too what the boundaries of this \"code\" are.  

They have a really cool menu advertising \"retro\" drinks like champagne cocktails, Manhattans, and scorpions in big bowls.   I ordered a Vodka Gimlet (which seems more and more to becoming an endangered species as far as bartenders go) and our friend ordered a Beautiful.  Both drinks were made correctly with no questions asked.  

Again this place can be pricy.  In fact we spent more here in the same amount of time as we did at Treasures, a very high end strip club.

Money aside, I would find a reason to go to Vegas just to hang out at the Peppermill Fireside Lounge.

The ONLY reason i don't give it 5 stars is the cost.

Edit:  My wife's preferred drink this weekend was a Pina Colada.  She wanted me to point out that the Peppermill was the ONLY establishment that served her PC in a hurricane glass as it SHOULD be.  It may not seem important but it shows that they pay attention to the details."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a Vegas institution. There is always a wait and for good reason.

If you are looking for diner food, there is nowhere else to go. Skip your hotel coffee shop and head over here. The food is great. Portion sizes are enormous. I am quite the eater and it didnt look like I barely made a dent in my scramble.

The Peppermill is the perfect place to go for breakfast if you have been up all night. Perhaps hungover. You need some good food? This is the ultimate Vegas eatery."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to stop here for a few drinks and I'm so glad we did! We decided to sit in the lounge and the atmosphere was so chill and laid-back. They have plenty of open seating in the form of red half moon sofas and of course the fire-pit was awesome to sit by. The service was also great, they have plenty of drinks and food you can order and the prices are very reasonable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is my all time favorite 24hr diner. The atmosphere is perfect for the strip with purple and pink neons."}
{"text":"I've been here several times; usually in the early hours of the morning from 4am - 5am. The food is good, although it is a somewhat limited menu. There is a large variety of special drinks I've seen the bartenders make here that I've never seen anywhere else. Happy hour drink specials take place everyday from 3pm - 6pm, and 9pm - 11pm, and the bartending staff is very friendly and helpful! They're very knowledgeable about all of the items on their menu, and are not shy about offering their personal opinions of their favorite dishes etc.

The neon lights give the place sort of an old Vegas feel, which I like, and they have a knack for rewinding the time with their music videos from the 90's. I've also always enjoyed hanging out by the fire pit with the blue flame; it serves as a great place to hang out with friends after a night out of clubbing and drinks. Only downside--location. Not a huge fan of the area it is located in but what're you gonna do?

I'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"A visit to the Peppermill is always a staple when on a visit to Las Vegas.  The overall above quality diner food, attentive waiters, and excellent atmosphere always provide for a great visit.  

On our most recent visit on Saturday at around 11 am, we knew it would be busy and were told there was a 45min wait.  In comes the Fireside Lounge where we able to find a seat to pass the time where we ended up easily waiting 25 minutes before being asked for our drink order.  Once our drinks arrived in a timely fashion after ordering, they were exactly what we wanted.  As our wait grew longer, we began to wonder if we were forgotten.  At the hour and a half mark after hearing name after name, we went to check on the status of our table for 3 and upon arriving at the hostess stand we discovered our name had been erroneously scratched off at least 40 minutes prior.  Upon this discovery they promised to seat us right away, which they did.

We ordered a mixture of lunch and breakfast items and as always they were huge portions and delicious.  Once seated for our meal, everything exceeded our expectations.  Disappointed in the hostess service and lack of trying to recover better, but with dozens of great meals we've had at the Peppermill over the past 10 years, this was the first dropped ball we can remember.  

PS Favorite items are Nachos with beef and the Reuben with onion rings and always wash it down with a 64 oz Scorpion drink!"}
{"text":"Decor and atmosphere is so attracting, I'm having fun just walking in :) Service is always hit or miss though, especially when they're really packed late at night. You get seated then wait for your food server then along comes a cocktail waitress from the Fireside Lounge. Food has always been great especially with their large portions. If theres a long wait, I suggest moseying on over to the Lounge and have a drink while ya wait :) Peppermills definitely a spot to check out while you're in Vegas even just once."}
{"text":"The lounge is a must see. Food is huge portions but really good. Did i say visit there lounge..i love it. Drinks are enormous and sooo good!!"}
{"text":"I ate here on Saturday morning! The food was good, everyone was nice. I ate the pesto chicken sandwich it was good but I felt I wasn't satisfied with the meal. I was having high expectations. Their pancakes are good they made a Mickey face. I recommend to go eat here"}
{"text":"For the most part food was good. I ordered ribs and biscuits and gravy. The ribs were really dry and gross. I ate my biscuits first while they were walking around asking if it was ok and yes at the time it was good but by the time i ate my ribs they were gross and told them i was not satisfied with just the ribs the manager came and told me i didn't say anything before when they walked by and told him because i hadn't tried them so i didn't no they were Going to taste gross and all he said was he couldnt do anything about it but give me more bbq sauce now why would i want more sauce for when the ribs are dry. So all i have to say is make sure you try  all your food before because the manager doesn't care."}
{"text":"First place we ate in Vegas with recommendations from our cab driver and a hotel worker.  It was both of their first mentioned restaurant, so we tried it out.

Has a good atmosphere and good service.  We are breakfast and it was pretty good too.  Portions are giant.  My wife and kid couldn't eat all their meals.  At 10$ a plate it was a good deal.

All in all I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really love the 80's feel at this place and the fact that it is open all night.  Go in and sit by the fire in the bar if you are over 21.  Have some cocktails and appetizers.  Or sit in the main area and have a full meal.  I can get Oatmeal with fruit and brown sugar 24 hours a day.  I really like Breakfast around midnight.  My friends were happy with the regular food items though it can feel a little pricey for the food and drinks.  Give yourself time.  The wait staff is somewhat slow and they are always packed.  We met up with friends to eat something before their flight and it took almost an hour to get food."}
{"text":"I had fun at the fireside lounge. We had a little bachelorette get together and it had a nice vintage vibe and even had a photographer going around and taking photos. Good times!"}
{"text":"I almost threw up from the amount of food they gave me and I stupidly tried to eat all of. I ordered a milk shake and it was well over a litre. It was incredibly delicious but putting down that and a huge burger was a bit of a chore for my stomach.

But I feel like you have to check this place out. It feels like such a Vegas kind of place and the food is very tasty."}
{"text":"Really amazing service- and great bloody mary's.  I really like the fireside lounge.  It is hot in there though, so be prepared :).  I'm so glad this iconic place is still open.  We had a great time."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!!!!  
My friend specifically asked for no crab. When we told the waitress she said no way and got the manager. We did not even ask to remake the order but the manager immediately prompted that they can't remake the order and it's impossible that there's crab in it. They kept arguing and charged her full price his supposedly a manager with no skills Nicolas Ortho shouldn't be running peppermill"}
{"text":"First off if you love the feel of a throw back joint you will love this place!! The décor is amazing and the food has that home made, authentic kitchen  taste ( not to mention the plates and servings are huge!!!!!) If you get a chance try it, you will not be disappointed :D !!!!!! Oh and the price is in any ones budget !"}
{"text":"Everyone has already said it all.  Solid but unmemorable diner food, in a place that is divinely Vegas.

It's a must-see.  Ambience is 6 stars.

The rest doesn't matter much.  It's edible.  You won't get food poisoning.  Good drunk food alternative to Denny's.  Worth the trip even if it's out of the way."}
{"text":"Laid back good food cool waitress Cheap I'd go back was here 12/8/11"}
{"text":"Strawberry Daiquiri so good you'll never even taste the rum that's hiding in it!

Service is fast and efficient, and food has large portion sizes. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Want a to take a time machine back to Vegas in it's hay day? Come here!! Tacky neon lights and outside décor inside. Plush, colorful booths, fire pits surrounded by water, stained glass light shades with pink flamingos. It's the 70's all over again! Open 24 hours a day, you can get your fix of all things old Vegas and delicious whenever you desire.

The drinks are pretty weak but the food is fantastic. There's a lot to offer on the menu. Definitely enough to accommodate whoever walks in the door. I am particularly fond of their breakfast food. My favorite, their hashbrowns. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. 

Coffee's always hot and fresh. Wait staff are always on top of it. You'll never sit without a refill or with any dirty plates in your way. Be prepared to wait for a table. Anytime I have come in, I've waiting at least 20 minutes. This past weekend it was an hour. I would wait it out, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Warning- this place is not in any of the big hotels and about a 5 minute drive from the \"end of the strip\" i.e. the Encore hotel. There used to be a peppermill closer to where I live, but it was closed and replaced with a buffet (yuck!). When you walk in you think you have turned back the hands of time and entered the 80's and ended up in Reno, NV. The decor is loud and in your face. The booths are big, black, and super shiny with bright pink lighting all throughout! I swear this place was used during the filming of some 80's mob movies- but I could be wrong!  Food wise this place is just great if you want huge portions, grease to soak up the alcohol, and prices that you probably wont find in any of the big hotels. Oh and if you are not done drinking they have a full bar to keep the blood levels low in your alcohol stream!"}
{"text":"So good.  Lots of choices and HUGE Portions.  Very busy, expect a wait. Sit at the counter and you may just get right in."}
{"text":"I can officially say that after living in Las Vegas on and off for the past 12 years I can finally cross this off my list. I had the Peppermill patrami burger. I ordered it medium rare it came out medium well. The drink service took forever and my wife's eggs Benedict were mehhh! I will visit again but only if entertaining people from out of town that would like to visit for nostalgic reasons. Check it off the list. Been there done that nothing special in my opinion."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast in Vegas. The food and proportions are amazing. Plan ahead for the wait as everyone else seems to agree."}
{"text":"When we walked in, the decor was funky. They sat is fast. We had our waitresses attend to us within 5 minutes of seating.  The food was very good and the very large portions. The eggs benedicts were one of the best ones i've tasted so far. I recommend this place if you are a breakfast person!"}
{"text":"Nicely done gourmet food that came quickly and tasted good. A refreshing dining experience in a sea of low quality options."}
{"text":"A great 24/7 restaurant to help cure that infamous Vegas hangover. What did I order? I can't recall. Such a blur. I'm assuming it was quality food and equally tasty because I didn't puke. 

One important detail I do remember. I was soo incredibly nauseated and dizzy. The waitress helped me with a glass of ice cold water and basically led me to the women's bathroom. She could tell I was a hot mess. I wish I could remember her name so I could call back and thank her and let her manager know she went above and beyond. 

I wouldn't advise going alone-- it's sketchy. The outside environment. Or, is it perfectly safe and I'm still hungover writing this review? Oh, damn you, Vegas."}
{"text":"Skip the buffets but be prepared to wait for a table esp on a weekend morning. However every time I've visited, the staff has always been courteous and efficient and seat people very quickly. The food is delicious and plentiful so come hungry. Be sure to order a giant muffin as your bread side....it's practically a meal in itself.  I've eaten late night and breakfast here on several occasions and have never been disappointed. Definitely a must visit when in Vegas for a weekend."}
{"text":"The interior is Gaudy and reminds me being in some strip bar but it is so Las Vegas! The food was good, but not the best. The portions were huge and the service great! The prices were a little but by the looks of the place being full......I guess people are willing to pay."}
{"text":"Great food but be prepared to be fully stuffed when you eat here. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a must for a hangover breakfast or late night in Vegas. It is truly a Las Vegas landmark. I have been several times, but this most recent trip this past Sunday morning was great as usual. I have tried both the Marco Pollo omelet and the Peppermill omelet. Both were great. The highlight of this last trip to the Peppermill for me was the purchase of the rainbow turbinado sugar and sugar dispenser. I was asking the waitress about it when she informed me that I could purchase it! I WAS THRILLED! I got a 5 lb. bag of it complete with the dispenser. Best impulse purchase ever. The Fireside Lounge is also great to grab a drink while you wait for a table. The Peppermill is ALWAYS packed. Mimosas from the Fireside Lounge are on point! Must do."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I used to live in Vegas and this the favorite of both locas and tourists. If you're in Vegas for only one night, forget all the casinos, you HAVE to go here. This is authentic Las Vegas, where the waitresses wear Toni Tenille halter jumpsuits and there is a fire surrounded by water. I can't even put it into words how fabulous this lounge is. The coffeeshop is average, but get into the lounge!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Go to place for Breakfast!!! Always good.. Coffee is just right.. atmosphere is Chill.. great place to maybe rub elbows with some Vegas Performers..
The Bloody Marys are da Bomb!!!"}
{"text":"The BEST restaurant to have breakfast and drinks ! The food is amazing and the service is the same !"}
{"text":"Blah ... it is a Denny's with even bigger portions. Meaning you pay $13 for a pancake and you get a really big pancake. The food in general is no better than any other fast casual breakfast place just bigger portions. Our server, Cheyanne, we think forgot our order because when she started serving people around us, who sat down 45 minutes after our party of 6, she said the delay was \"making a grilled cheese\". Funny, the grilled cheese came out first! She also brought toast to one diner 30 minutes before their eggs arrived. When they asked for \"hot toast\" for their meal she seemed a little put out. BUT, the Peppermill is an establishment and part of the Vegas experience. Just don't think you are going to get anything special except for your Bloody Mary served by a woman in an evening gown."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast!! Massive tasty food portions and reasonably priced. Ordered the French toast with eggs and turkey sausage. Yummy! Will definitely be back. Atmosphere is a little less than desiring. But food and the mimosas were superb! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's not much better than  Kady's really, but the portions are huge and it's a smidge less greasy.   Don't forget those Las Vegas prices!  The coffee is drinkable, and the waitresses were the usual skimpy outfits, which can kinda suck when the waitress really shouldn't be wearing skimpy outfits.  Oh yeah, and it's got neon lights, to distract you from the fact that it's still not much better than Kady's, which I gave 2 stars.  

The portions here are massive, so if you need a good hangover cure after a night of heavy drinking, this will surely fill you up and grease you up.  

However, if it is possible to venture out a little further, and wait for a good meal, the nicer hotels tend actually have decent breakfasts, so long as you avoid the buffets."}
{"text":"I have been to Vegas many times and have always wanted to come here...well I finally got to! yay! it a diner and this review is only on what i ordered a philly cheese steak after all Philly won...bad choice horrible sammy I mean who puts tomatoes and let on a philly cheese steak! and I paid extra to get the onion rings which were good but would have been better if hot...not slaming them some of the food I saw was soo good looking...my bad for the wrong order...i will go back and get something more apropo for a diner..."}
{"text":"This is the diner that all other diners aspire to be when they grow up.

That being said, The Peppermill is a must-see/do for anyone, Vegas native or not. I genuinely believe that this place has got to at least be a contender for top five diners in the U.S.!

The first time I ever came here, as soon as I walked through the door, I gasped in delight. I couldn't help myself. This is the prettiest diner you have ever seen!!! It's so beautius. The faux foliage with lights, the neon, the dim lighting... It all works so well together, and creates an overall classic retro, yet modernized feel. They have these cool flat screen TVs on the wall at one booth that flash to different scenes around the world. Really nifty to watch while you wait for your food. This place is maybe where say, a pimp might bring his bottom bit*h out for a semi-classy meal at 3am. I mean that in a good way, seriously.

If you have read the other reviews, then you already know: This is the place to come for some after-bar people watching. They get all kinds up in these parts. But everyone is so soothed by the wonderful interior ambiance and happily munching away at num nums that the times I have been there, I have not seen the typical drunk and angry bickering here.

The food is more expensive than your usual diner fare, but it's worth it. Not only is it all pretty much delicious, but you get large portion sizes too. I also love that you are serviced by the waitresses from the Fireside Lounge at your table, so if you wanna keep boozin' it up, that option is open to you. 
Speaking of waitresses, all the ladies who work in the diner are wearing the cutest outfits!! I almost considered temporarily getting a job there, jut to get the outfit!

I have never actually been to the Fireside Lounge part, but it seems like a must-do thing the next time I stop by. I can't wait!"}
{"text":"On our way out of Vegas on Monday morning, we decided to check out the Peppermill which some friends had told us about. For a Monday morning, it was pretty crowded when we arrived at 10:30 am. Wait time was about 20 minutes before we were seated at a table. We weren't in a huge rush, so it didn't bother us.

The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the large amount of neon pink throughout the restaurant. Not only that, but there are also lots of fake trees and plants. It totally gives it a kitschy diner feel and reminds me of why I love Vegas! The menu is large and you can get anything on it 24 hours a day. Feeling hungry for an omelet - check; feeling like a chicken caesar wrap - check; does shrimp scampi sound good - check; how about ribs - check. If you're craving it, I bet it's on the Peppermill menu.

My husband and I stuck with breakfast since it was mid-morning. I had the eggs and bacon and my husband had a belgian waffle. He liked the waffle well enough and it was quite large. My scrambled eggs were cooked well (not watery at all) and my bacon came out crispy as ordered. I hated the hash browns - not only were they not cooked all the way, but they lacked the crispiness that I prefer. It was basically just a pile of potato on the plate. For a soda, glass of orange juice and 2 breakfast entrees, our bill came to $29 before tip.

We were a tad disappointed in the food, but I guess if you go late at night after a full night of drinking, it probably is decent."}
{"text":"We went here this am for breakfast.  I decided to go here after reading all the positive yelp reviews.  I cannot speak for the lunch and dinner menu because we had breakfast but it was amazing. I ordered the French toast ambrosia and it was exactly like I saw in everyone else's yelp review.  The man that came for our drink order did not bring all our drinks...he brought two of five. It was crowded but we were seated quickly. I enjoyed our waitress. Her name was Elisha and she was great!  Very happy we stopped over today!"}
{"text":"In Vegas besides gambling, drinking, partying, there's a lot of good places to eat! Saw this place as me and my bf was passing by to go pick up his friend and decided to come back to this place and eat for lunch! There was a wait list and it was cool that we got to hang out in the fireside lounge and get some drinks while waiting in a dark, mysterious lounge by a fire that was surrounded by water. In a way this diner was a bite too dark and it pretty old school retro. I mean it is a diner and at least they did something interesting about this place lol. After our wait was over we got seated, there were fake trees surrounding the booths and was not as dark as the lounge area. 

Me and my bf split the Joe's San Francisco Special after asking the waitress if the food portion is share able and she said yes so we just shared it. OMG the food portion size is huge! Good thing we shared because it was also so filling that we could not even finish it.... The food itself was interesting it seems to be it could of been scrambled eggs with spinach , plus some pork sausage on the side, with hash browns, and all covered on top like a nacho cheese sauce but instead its all layered in the dish as one whole meal!  It was quite yummy! Will come back here again if I come to Vegas again!"}
{"text":"A vegas classic. No one is going there for organic or vegan options. It's just good diner style food snd an awesome atmosphere. And everyone Imygerr is so nice."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because there were bums passed out in front of the neighboring Denny's...This place is a trip, and a true Vegas gem!  The menu is literally a book (think Cheesecake Factory) with about anything you could think of up for grabs 24 hours a day!  You could see anything from a few girls passed out in their eggs, to folks doing business here at 3am- so the entertainment alone is priceless!  Our service was terrific, and the place has a fun funky feel with neon and floral everywhere!

My dining partners had the NY Strip and Eggs, while I had the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict- a little pricy at 24.00 but hey, it's Vegas!"}
{"text":"I saw the rumors that this place is closing and I weep for the future of Vegas.  I love love love this place.

Even though I'm a native of Seattle and have only been to Vegas 4 times, I've made it a point to stop at the Peppermill for late night grub and insanely strong drinks in the Fireside Lounge every single time I've visited since my 21st birthday (oh so many moon ago).

On my last trip to Vegas this past December I got to introduce a whole posse of Vegas virgins to the neon splendor and faux cherry tree glory that is the Peppermill.  

Vegas is not cheap anymore, Vegas is very hip now and gone are many of the old cheezy Vegas landmarks that us out-of-towners tend to associate with this fair city, except the Peppermill.  This place is the platonic ideal of Vegas and I hope it stays.

To echo some other reviews: insane portions to soak up alchohol? Check. Pretty hostesses? Check.  Unpretentious atomosphere? Check.  Strong drinks in a great setting? Check.  

Go while you still can before it turns in to some new mega resort that welcomes only the very rich and very beautiful."}
{"text":"This is a fun place a little off the strip with a little less of the hustle and bustle of the other restaurants. It gives you a diner feel all while still having a little Vegas flair. The portion sized are vast, and the food is surprisingly very good. The drinks are fantastic, and the wait staff is delightful. Great place to go for a good well-priced meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the place to go back in time in Las Vegas. We went on a Thursday night around 10:30-11:30pm. There were plenty of large booths to choose from.  I like that the servers are dressed in long, black gowns. It feels like vintage sexiness. The entire place is vintage -from the orange upholstered banquettes to the sunken fire pit. Each booth feels private, and since this place is kind of surreal in a back-in-time way, I could imagine that a couple looking to spice things up could start a night of sexiness at this smoky-mirrored mecca. Note - this place is not for those who like new, modern, high-end things. You will not find the Peppermill sexy if you don't like a little grittiness. If you're fancy and like new, sparkly things, check out the Chandelier Lounge in the Cosmopolitan instead."}
{"text":"Maurice the manager was very accommodating and attentive.  He is very hands on as I noticed him interacting with many guests.  Our waiter Alfonso was good but definitely could have been more attentive. The cocktail waitresses were good my dirty wine glass took about 10 minutes to be replaced.  The food was good.  The restaurant vibe was fun.  Would definitely visit again.  Seems especially good for late night munchies."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch while on vacation. Portion sizes are worth the price you pay and food was really good. If I ever make my way back out here ai would stop at this place again."}
{"text":"This diner reminds me of HHAGG. The portions are massive and prices are very reasonable. 

We had a party of 4 with a 40 minute wait during the weekend. Luckily, we were able to snag a booth in the lounge. That helped the time go by. They will call your party over the intercom when it's time. 

Was the food good? Meh."}
{"text":"The food is great but they got my wife's order wrong twice. Didn't have time to wait around another 15 min. for a third screw up so we just paid for my meal and left."}
{"text":"If you want to eat at a Denny's type establishment go to Denny's. It's much better than Peppermill! However, if you like dining with a lamp hanging in your face, this place fits the bill. It's unfortunate, because the decor and neon lights are cool. In the end, we felt like we were in a bad episode of Charlie's Angels. The food was very sub par. I ordered the \"signature\" burger, and found it dry and flavorless. My wife's turkey burger was unseasoned, bland, and tasted like charcoal. The sweet potato fries were limp, and tasted like they had been sitting in a pool of grease. You can't order drinks from your server, so you have to track down the cocktail waitress. We tried the Scorpion, which supposedly had six shots. It was basically a bowl of ice and fruit juice. There was also a guy going around offering to take a complimentary picture. It reminded me of the guy who would make balloon animals at Carlos Murphy's back in the 80s. The free picture was 3x5. He was harassing a family of Scandinavian tourists trying to get them to buy an 8x10 saying that this was the best deal they would find on the Strip. Overall my stomach felt like rocks the rest of the night. Thanks Peppermill for providing memories we will never forget!"}
{"text":"Great food with awesome service.  Very accommodating to us even when we're in a hurry and made some complicated orders.  The breakfast was all we had and it was so delicious.  It catered to my fitness diet and we can count on them for that. The great thing about this place, it's next door to our host hotel when we have to work all weekend. By the way, the lounge is a chill place to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Used to like this place for the \"old school Vegas\" feel and yummy greasy diner grub.  And I guess I still do, but I was really bummed when I ordered a $9.50 margarita and got what tasted like a leftover margarita.  You know like when you make a margarita and have some leftover in the shaker and all the ice melts and then you drink it sometimes against your better judgement...oh sorry.  Yeah, I know what a bad margarita tastes like and I know at almost  $10 a pop that shit better taste good.  So I was really pissed when the server wouldn't take the drink back.  She said that's why they suggest the 50 cent upgrade when they take your order.  I'm sorry, shouldn't a $9 margarita taste pretty good to begin with?  I asked her if i decided to upgrade would the bartender just pour the shot on top of my already crappy margarita and she said YES!!!  At this point,(when i thought I wouldn't be getting my money back) I said sure throw some more tequila(and possible spit from the bartender) on my shitty drink.  The drink comes back and Quel Surprise! still shit!  Fuming inside, i thought I'd try my luck with the manager.  She explained that it is their policy not to return drinks and that's how it is at most places on the strip, but she was kind enough(and seeing that i had barely touched the drink) to take the drink off the bill.  I don't want to write off the Peppermill because it is fun and kitschy.  I just know that i won't order  a margarita there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend made a reservation last night for 2 at 8:45pm, we walked in and he told the host he had called and made a reservation but seemed like she didn't write it down or knew what she was doing. She didn't even greet us or nothing and as she walked us to the table she was talking to another customer instead of asking us how we were or anything...very unprofessional.  On the other hand our server was great, very sweet and caring but this stupid camera guy came up to us and just stood here didn't say a word then says \"would you guys like a picture, it's free\" we took pictures I bought 2 and he was just so weird and awkward I felt so uncomfortable then this kid says that his feet hurt...I told him he has an easy job and he should be fine. I don't think anyone should complain about an easy ass job like come on. My burger wasn't even that good, my boyfriend got steak worth $30 he asked for medium rare and it was over cooked...we left and of course left. Good tip as always but this restaurant seems like the managers don't know how to run it we left and no one said goodbye. Food is extremely expensive for shitty food and horrible customer service. I would never come back...also my boyfriend got extremely sick because the food was bad. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Cool ambiance I really loved how everyone and the place looked but our waitress was so slow and the service was bad and our waitress kept talking to our friends then we asked her about our potato skins and she brought them to us cold cuz she was busy talking she also forgot our other appetizer and accused me of never ordering it like wtf it doesn't matter if I did or didn't you say you're sorry and bring me my food not argue with me. That's the strip for ya"}
{"text":"How did I not come here before?

This place was super D - LISH!!! also, fetured on Anthony Bordain's No Reservations... 

Let's start with the wait.. .oh hell yeah there's a wait about 1.5 - 2 hours, yes it was that packed and we didn't get to actually eat until about 1:00 pm or so. 

We decided to take our group of 10 and sit in the Fireside lounge...This gem is so hidden that we didn't even know until about 30 minutes of waiting outside.

Lets start with the FIreside Lounge - Think Super fabulous 70's, neon Lights, water / fire pit, ultra comfy seperate seating areas, did I mention the Scorpian( also featured on Anthony Bordain's No Reservations) yeah that ones a rough one- its super huge!!!  My friends and I all started talking on why we haven't yet partied here and enjoyed getting drunk at the lounge... really why haven't we? Next time my friends next time...

So we get called to sit down to eat, the ambiance is like the old 70's/ early 80's charm again but with faux trees and neaon lights and faux plants through out... charming.

We get an amazing server, Jennifer, well we are told the portions are huge, in hearing that and then actually seeing the items delivered to the table - thank God we listened and we shared plates!!!

Breakfast menu is really off the chain here! we all took bites off each others plates to sample the menu.. so not disappointing at all eveything was great!  Chicken fried steak, eggs benedict, Joes grill breakfast thing, biscuits and gravy it was all scrumptious.

After inhaling most of my food we were all pretty much full and decided to walk up the strip to get back to normal after the food coma we just endeared.

It was D LIsh and I will be definately coming back on my next trip to vegas, maybe after the breakfast rush.."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is a must when in Sin City. Their country fried steak is amazing! Their cocktails not so great. Staff is always friendly get there their before the rush or be ready to wait at least at hour or more. 
Plenty of parking and Vegas decor!"}
{"text":"It's a perfect place to go after a night on the strip. The decorations are slightly eccentric, but the people are great and the portions are large. I definently recommend the waffles. :)"}
{"text":"This is as Vegas as it gets, folks. Nothing says Vegas like being greeted by a row of slot machines upon entering a diner with decor that looks like an indoor park threw up all over a casino. That might not make sense, but anyway, the food is awesome.

My cousin and I had one of those late nights and wanted some grub before heading home. She wanted breakfast food, and I wanted something with meat and fries and maybe some greens to make me feel like I'm eating \"healthy.\" Not a problem. Peppermill's menu has a good amount of tasty options.

Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap: I ordered this wrap which comes with the choice of either curly fries, regular fries, and onion rings. I chose curly fries because I can't remember a time when I went to a restaurant where that was an option. I think wraps can be hit or miss, but this was a hit.  I was really diggin' the combination of the spicy chicken and the mixed greens and house made ranch dressing. The curly fries were crunchy, greasy, and delicious.

The service is decent, though slow. We waited quite a while for our food to arrive, but the wait is worth it considering how good the food is and the generous portions you receive. 

Peppermill's location is on the sketchy side of The Strip, but the parking lot is well-lit and there is security that patrols the area. 

The prices here are more than the typical 24-hour diner-style establishments, but it's worth it. Skip going to the Denny's that's just down the road if you want some good, late grubbin' after a long night."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for breakfast on my actual birthday. My girl recommended this place and raved about how cool it was and couldn't believe I had never been there before. It reminded me of some 70's porn like that Mark Walberg flick I can't think of right now. Anyway, as the hostess seated us I made sure to check our booth seats to make sure there weren't any stains on it (if you know what I mean). 

We decided to order and I went with a plain 2 eggs, hash brown and sausage meal with a strawberry mojito. My girl ordered french toast and eggs with a mimosa. There wasn't  really anything too special about the food. It was as basic as they come, but the drinks were pretty good! (Boogie Nights is the movie btw)

I did have the opportunity to check out the nice section (separate room) of the restaurant with the fire pit and TV's surrounding it and that part of the restaurant is really cool. I kind of wish we sat on that side and enjoyed my bday breakfast but honestly, I just wanted to eat and head out to downtown to gamble.

Overall, it was a cool experience to check out but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again. Especially when you have so many other cool spots to eat at in Vegas.

{"text":"Visited the Peppermill for a friends birthday gathering on a Friday night. Was nice and busy but not enough to feel overcrowded, just enough to feel like you're in the action of the Vegas strip. The location is right off of Las Vegas Blvd, so you can expect occupancy especially on a weekend. Awesome date spot if ya lookin for drinks and are trying to impress the lady (my girlfriend brought me here in our early days, smart gal)

The lounge was pretty comfortable considering we packed a corner booth with almost 20 people. Ambiance was awesome and probably the main sell of the joint. Groovy and aesthetically pleasing neons tones and retro seating and interior furnishings. Not to mention they were bumpin' nostalgic music videos from what felt like former MTV bops. The waitress was extremely accommodating and patient for a group of our size; she got every drink order correct, checked on us regularly and made us feel pretty comfortable. 

Drinks were great from what I gathered. The menu was cohesive and provided pictures, always helpful. Pretty sweet fishbowl option for the brave ones, fancy cocktails and beers. The cucumber drink seemed to be popular while I settled for a dead guy IPA in a bottle (delicious)

The only thing that keeps this place from fulfilling its potential is the lack of interesting dishes on the food menu. My impression was that it was very basic and easy dishes that you could expect at any restaurant/bar hybrid. With the glitz and glam of this spot, they could get away with an updated and modernized menu (in my opinion). Revitalized tapas and apps menu with creative or atleast interesting food options. Bacon wrapped dates, Shishito peppers, fondue, just some modern Las Vegas jazz you know?? It would complete the spot as a great date and general gathering destination."}
{"text":"So we tried this place for their Bloody Marys and appetizers. Bloody Mary is good. Spicy. We order the nachos and it's a mountain of yum!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Saturday. Service was subpar. Had a drink in the bar (which was tasty), but the bartender (David?) was short and unfriendly. After we were seated, we saw our waitress twice. Food was ok...I would compare to Denny's. I did love the motif though."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Vegas at least every year once since 2000 and have gone to the Pepper every time. Breakfast food is great. Huge, huge portions. I advise a compromise and sharing if u have a partner in crime. Fireside lounge is great. This place to me is the best example of a Vegas diner!
 
Great cheesey interior. Love it!"}
{"text":"After a long flight and long day this place is the best way to start your Las Vegas adventure.  Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and instead if standing in line for the breakfast Buffett get over here for some stick to your ribs comfort food.  

Make sure you ask for Angela she has been there for 30 years hard to believe it she looks like a teenager.  

Getting ready for #nada and #thewebdoc Speach tomorrow. #testimonialbuilder"}
{"text":"Old school Vegas dining. All portions are big enough to share. Been living here 20 years and every time I come, I ask myself why I don't make if here more often?"}
{"text":"Peppermill
It was super packed. The wait was 40 minutes. The wait wasn't worth it. The food was mediocre and customer service was not the best."}
{"text":"Gross Gross Gross!!!!! DO NOT waste your money ordered a porterhouse it was sliced very very thinly and it was so dry and rubbery.  Came with a wilted salad and a troth of cold nasty mushrooms!

I don't how they are 4 stars...crazy!!"}
{"text":"My friends recommended this location and so we decided to come here on our last day of our vacation.  This place is at the very end of The Strip so we took a cab there.  Its very dark in here.  The menu was big and a little overwhelming as there were so many options.  I ended up getting the Biscuit and Gravy.  The portion is so huge.  The Biscuits were made perfectly as it was moist and soft.    I really enjoyed my meal.  My hubby ordered the Chicken fried steak and eggs with a side of the short stacked pancakes.  He thought it was just okay.  The service here wasn't that great.  We always had to flag our waitress down if we needed something.  Our experience here was so so."}
{"text":"Looking for a fun morning place with the friends? This is the place to come. Great menu, ENORMOUS portions, so beware. 
     Good service the couple times I've been. Oh and if you're not done with the cocktails, head to the back.... A little cozy fireplace with a top notch bartender.
     I'd rather have great food and smaller portions to be honest. But here, you just have to indulge. 
    The Ferrari omelet is the bomb. hands down amazing."}
{"text":"Classic diner vibes, great reasonable food. Staple of every trip out there!

The portion sizes are good and they are also great for large parties!"}
{"text":"One of the coolest lounges I've been at. Nice fun drink menu, comfortable sofas to sit back and  talk on. Definitley the new kick it spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is real deal Vegas. This spot gets street cred for being featured in the  opening scenes of the movie Casino. The crazy lighting Red & Blue Neon, The fire in the fountain, The plastic flowers and mirrors everywhere just get you off center to begin with.
 The slanky dresses on the hot waitress only add to the class of Fireside lounge. Get a fishbowl drink, make out by the fire, wear sunglasses at night eat the Peppermill's giant Omelette. it's a surreal experience and a must when you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"place is overrated!  service was horrible..our server wasn't a server! she was a order taker! waited  forever. manager and server told US printer went down.hahahaha! one entree food wasn't cooked.other entree over cooked and hard as a rock! I work in this industry at a restaurant. I don't recommend nor will return! place is very  congested and small"}
{"text":"JACKPOT!  We've got a winner here. My friend INSISTED we stop by for breakfast. I've gotta say that I'm so glad he wouldn't let me leave Vegas until I did.

Never in a million years would I compliment bad decorating, but I gotta say, \"What a GROOVY place!\"  The atmosphere definitely makes you feel like you just stepped back into the 1970's (or early 80's) Down-chicka-down-down...

The wait was about 30 minutes, but it was worth it.
The tables were booths that felt like private coves.
Our waitress was really sweet, attentive and on top of everything.  I was amazed how she remembered all her tables with these tucked away cove-like booths.  (With all the mirrors and lights--it's definitely not a place where you can drink on the job!)

I ordered a salad and it was HUGE!
My husband had the egg white omelette and said it was great.
The coffee was fresh (We appreciated the large mugs, btw). The prices were a bit high for the diner atmosphere, but that wouldn't stop me from coming back.  Because, let's face it-- I've wasted my cash on worse experiences in this town!"}
{"text":"It was overall fine. Service is pretty good and food is mediocre. Not sure what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"What a gem! Be sure to grab a cocktail in the lounge, that is the best part!"}
{"text":"The experience was much better previously.  Long wait to get be seated, had to ask for sugar 3 times and 3 different personnel,  food portions were large but lacked in flavor."}
{"text":"I decided to bring my beautiful lady here. I read this place was one of the top places to go in Vegas. So why wouldn't I bring the love of my life here? She deserves nothing but the best. 

We sat down and ordered mimosas and our breakfast. She had the scrambled eggs and turkey snausage. I had the eggs and hash. 

What's even better was that I was sitting in the best diner in Las Vegas with the love of my life. Although I didn't love the eggs and corned beef hash I loved the company I was with. It makes me the happiest man on earth when I am with the love of my life. She always has the right things to say, except when I'm right of course. She always has something funny to say, or so she thinks. I find it cute nonetheless. All I know is that my lady makes me so proud and grateful to be the man in her life.

The Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge you get 5 stars from me not because it's awesome to see waitresses walking around at 9 o'clock in the morning in ball gowns or because of the cool lighting or even the salty corned beef hash, it's because I cherish every moment with my woman and I got the share this memory with her in your establishment."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!! I didn't eat at the restaurant as when we went there was quite a wait so we opted to sit fireside (in the lounge) and order drinks and apps.  First off the hostess and wait staff were friendly and helpful.  Our waitress answered all our questions about drinks and when one of the couples with us ordered the large nachos she recommended the small and boy am I glad she did because the small could easily feed 4-6.  The drinks were well priced and made well.  I opted for the Bloody Mary while the BF got The Scorpion (as seen on TV) - both were mighty tasty.  Our group not only had the nachos but also the BBQ sliders, ribs and the app sampler.  All were made really quick and tasted good.  There was even a photographer who came around and took group pics of us (free of charge).  We showed up around 4pm on a Friday and though the fireside table was reserved at 7pm the waitress politely notified us but didn't pressure us to leave or even move (which we did when more of our party showed up around 6:30pm).  All in all I give this place 5 stars and will be going back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"For lunch or dinner, get the BBQ burger. One of the best I ever had. 
Great food, service, price and location."}
{"text":"I came here with 15 of my other family members at around 11:30pm. The first thing I thought was COOL I love the neon decor. I'm into anything old school & funky. The menu has your typical diner type food (like Denny's as others would say), but everything seemed overpriced. I wasn't in the mood for anything else but salad, soup, & bread. I had their garden salad, mushroom cream soup, and some garlic bread. Sadly the only thing I liked much out of all three was the bread, but I didn't even finish it. My boyfriend had a cheeseburger & we had \"heard\" that the burgers here were humongous. His wasn't even big at all, and he claims it was \"alright\". However my nephew ordered a mushroom burger & his was big! I saw a few other tables who ordered the nachos (from the appetizer menu)..boy that thing is HUGE!!! I would've been down for that instead :P My other cousin ordered the quesadilla which looked delicious but she didn't seem to finish it. Most of my other family members ordered breakfast & they seemed satisfied; they came in huge portions. 

Anyways, I wasn't as pleased so idk if I'm willing to come back & try something else. It just seems like a restaurant that catches your eye right off the Strip, and it lures you in."}
{"text":"Two words: share & delicious. This is a staple stop every time we are near Vegas! You can easily share any dish. We lean towards the nachos and then the brownie sundae or strawberry shortcake! It is quite the experience a must stop!"}
{"text":"Pure Vegas at its best. It is a very large restaurant with plenty of parking. The servers and cocktail servers wear fun outfits to serve. There is usually a wait time, but the wait is worth it. I ordered a basic breakfast plate with hash browns, eggs and bacon. It came with this incredible lemon/cranberry muffin that I sadly left as I was paying. My husband ordered some delicious pile of food with ground beef. He also ordered a Bloody Mary with an extra shot. The portions are plentiful and you won't be disappointed in the quality."}
{"text":"the lounge here is my very favorite place in all of las vegas! (i've never actually eaten at the restaurant; maybe i should try it one day.)

i think everyone should come here! why wouldn't you want to sit on a plush velvet couch around a flaming fountain thing, bathed in the glow of pink and blue neon, sipping the fruity cocktail of your choice from a large selection of tropical drinks? the servers are friendly, the drinks are huge and the atmosphere is amazing! it attracts an extremely eclectic crowd, ranging from old people to hipsters to club-goers looking to unwind after tao shuts down, locals and tourists alike. the fireside lounge is the most awesomely tacky place in the whole wide world and i love it."}
{"text":"Went here late night/early morning and it was a disaster. Was with a group of 6 with one woman who was Jewish and wearing the required snood for her religion. We were all settled in and enjoying the fireside when the waitress informed our friend she couldn't sit on that side of the restaurant because of her head covering. So they told her she would have to sit on the ice side, which none of us wanted to do. We were outraged! We understood we were sitting 3 ft away from a fire pit that was in the center of a pool. We are all over the age of 26, did they think we were gonna play with fire? Even though we had already placed our orders we left and will never return."}
{"text":"Located near Ross. Soo true about the decor looking like the 80s threw up in there. Bar with fireside pit accompanied by water. The restaurant itself has the whole diner vibe going on. While waiting for 50 mins we drank some mimosas (tasty) :D doesn't disappoint. The french toast collage was good but nothing out of the norm. The swiss and mushroom burger was huge and it was quite juicy. The waitress we had was friendly and prompt. Theres a little jar that has colorful sugar crystals on the table. The bacon was so crunchy and it was good quality bacon lol. Not that cheap clear bacon. Eggs were ordered over well and they got it just right! Definitely a must try when visiting Vegas!

Oh and btw they take and give you a complimentary picture :D"}
{"text":"This is such a cool vegas staple. The little lounge on the left when you walk in has the coolest little tables with fires and water! The drinks are really unique and it's cool to see all the movies it's been in. It's opened 24 hours which is awesome and is always busy. I've enjoyed the large portions along with the unique atmosphere for several years! There is even gambling"}
{"text":"It was just ok and very pricey! My stomach was actually hurting for two days after I ate there for some unknown reason. Nothing to write home to mother about! I did however enjoy the free picture from the resident photographer."}
{"text":"Place has a cool feel to it with the mirrors and artifical trees. Food is mediocre, but portions are huge enough to share."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere!  Great prices for the large portions.   Although there was a wait to get it, you can't blame people for wanting to come here!  Just fantastic- wish we would have found this place earlier in the trip."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after a long day of walking the strip. Saw this place on Las Vegas Magazine and it had some good reviews. I also yelped it BEFORE I came and it had my MANDATORY 4 stars! The only weird, \"negative\" thing would be the fake flowers everywhere. I kept hearing Robert Irvine from restaurant impossible in my head \"these fakes flowers gotta go!\". Other than that, no complaints whatsoever.
Service was good. Prices were good, STRIP prices, so it's not cheap, but not over the top strip prices either. Food was pretty damn good too. My cousin got the pastrami sandwich. It looked really good. Large sandwich and lots of fries. He also got the margarita with the corona in it. I'd seen those in SA (wish I got one there). He really enjoyed his meal. I got the tomato, mozzarella and basil on \"toasted\" ciabatta bread. The bread could have been toasted more (but that's my preference). The pesto was tasty. There was a really nice amount of fresh mozzarella. The tomatoes could have been better. They were a little mushy, but when eaten as a sandwich, you didnt notice. I got onion rings (LOVE THEM!!!!) as my side. They were very good. There just wasn't too much to offer vegetarians, but I would recommend and might come back!"}
{"text":"Best place to go for late night grub, serving size is huge and if you have a sweet tooth I would recommend the mud pie.  Its super chocolatey goodness with a large amount of ice cream.  The strawberry shortcake and brownie desserts come in a huge glass cup with ice cream which are also great . It's a diabetic coma waiting to happen ."}
{"text":"Four stars for outstanding service, a phenomenal Blue Hawaiian, and decent food.

The Peppermill is a 24/7 must for the Vegas visitor looking for the taste and feel of Old Vegas. Bright, lively and always open The Peppermill will not disappoint if you're looking for a great drink (or 5) and some solid diner food.

The sampler platter was okay.

Our Blue Hawaiians were super tasty!

Our server, Kaitlyn, was attentive, helpful, and on top of all our needs even though she was skillfully dealing with a large table of 16 people while taking care of us at the same time. We tipped her well but should have tipped even more! Thank you Kaitlyn!

Thank you Peppermill!!! Never change please!"}
{"text":"this place is hilarious. and we didn't even see the lounge behind the restaurant. 

the decor is like over the top 80's chinese restaurant style with almost life-sized cherry blossom trees and neon all over the ceiling. 

we almost didn't go in because it looks so much like a sketchy strip club from the outside.  

the food is good - not anything fancy. 

luckily before we ordered our three omelets the waitress informed us (thank god) that each omelet was made from TEN EGGS! - a piece of information that actually made me throw up in my mouth a little bit.

we ended up splitting one or two and getting a parfait which was cool but we didn't come close to finishing - but it was good."}
{"text":"Classic style diner with a huge menu and very reasonable prices for being on the Strip.  A solid choice if you're looking for a place to grab a bite at any hour of the day."}
{"text":"A cool place. There is for sure always a variety of different people in here.

I like the breakfast and salads. The bacon is cooked to order and delicious. I had a huge delicious breakfast on this last visit. The breakfast is always my fav here.

Be prepared that you will get a BIG plate no matter what you order. I ordered a salad once and ate off it for several days lol. The salads are seriously huge and good.

The \"conquest\" in a great sandwich. Curly fries pair well with it.

The servers are nice but chatty with each other and not always paying attention to the tables.

Kinda pricey but you get a lot of food. It attracts many tourists but at most times you will find more of us locals inside eating or having a drink with friends."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas! Be prepared to share as the portions are humongous. The hubs and I barely made a dent in the 1 side pancake we ordered. It was moist and delicious. The Lorraine omelet had the perfect portions of bacon, onions and cheese. Coffee cups are deep keeping the coffee warm throughout your meal. Definitely choose the side muffin over toast or bagel. They are moist and yummy, perfect warmed up the next morning with your hotel coffee. Didn't get a chance to sit in the fireside lounge as our visit was a short one but we will be making the Peppermill a Vegas tradition from now on."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Old school Vegas feel. Great vegetarian selection. Food comes In large portions and the food is always amazing. My favorite dish is the crab cake Ben. They have a restaurant side and a lounge side. The lounge has fire Pitt and comfortable low lit seating. The perfect spot to come eat after a night of clubbing. If your hungry or u just wanna hang out and drink.  If your ever in vegas u have to try it."}
{"text":"I asked my Uber drive to take me to somewhere that was open and we ended up here. It was bad however  I have had better. I had a burger and it was cooked perfect;y. Most reviews say you need to have breakfast which I didn't. The portions are a lot and it was not expensive. Service wasn't the greatest however I was by myself so maybe there was no need to constantly check."}
{"text":"I've been to the Fireside lounge a few times and it's definitely a chill and relaxing place to meet up with some girls or your mates. Having said that, I was interested in trying the food in the Peppermill diner one evening. I ordered a ribeye steak dinner which set me back about $35 including a coke and tip. I wasn't really impressed with the meal at all. Salad was terrible, baked potato dry and old and the mushrooms were disgusting (I love mushrooms btw). The steak was the only thing that kept me from returning the meal. You can easily find steak dinners all around Vegas for under $10. They probably have better choices on their menu but I advise you not to order a steak dinner here. Herbs and Rye off Sahara can fill that void if you feel like splurging on a proper steak. Just my .02"}
{"text":"Always a favorite in Vegas - great service, and WOW the amount of food would feed 3 people per 1 order.  Expect to take home leftovers.  I took my son and his girlfriend, and they loved the atmosphere - great place"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was really great. At 6 PM there is no problem getting a table at all. We'll for sure come here again."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was of age. Gotta hang out in the lounge! very comfortable & romantic to have a drink by the fire. Lot's of movies filmed here."}
{"text":"It's surprising to see the 5-star reviews of this place. Not that it's bad, but it's not worthy of 5-stars. You come here for the quirkiness and the big plates of diner food. The service can be hit or miss - sometimes they are on their A game, other times you never see your waitress. Adding to this is having to wait on a cocktail waitress to order drinks. 

Good Highlights:
I appreciate being able to order a fresh salad from a diner. Their Southwest Salad is huge and tasty. 

Front door parking

Kid-friendly

Diverse menu - something for everyone

Bad Highlights:
Hit or miss service

Fireside Lounge - If you don't smoke or hate being around smoke, then it's impossible to have a cocktail in their Lounge. I had to get my drink and go out into the waiting area while we were waiting for friends to meet us for dinner. It was super bad.

Just a general observation for Vegas newbies:
I see some reviews saying their $29 steak was really just a $9 steak. FYI - This is what I like to call the Vegas tax, and while this is just a diner, you're still in Vegas. Everything is more expensive here, even diner food. If you want a good steak, you'll usually have to pay $45+ in Vegas. If you go to a diner for a steak, it will be a diner steak. You're looking at the price with the mentality of where ever it is you're coming from and setting the bar too high. A $29 ribeye on the strip IS a steal."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here twice on my recent stay. It was busy but my food arrived in a reasonable time. It was cooked exactly as I asked the waitress and bussers were all extremely friendly. And the food was delicious! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"BADASS!!! First time we were there and we went on a recommendation. The lounge is awesome and in itself is a great place to hang out. Then the food!!!! OMG!!!! Portions were awesome and the taste was awesome. The service was fantastic as well. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"The waitress was short with us, no one ever came by to refill our coffees or ask us how our food was, and the food was over-priced for what it was. I order the \"mediteranean\" omelet, but there was nothing mediteranean about it. Granted I should have actually read the description but I just assumed olives, feta, things like that. But instead it had shrimp, crab meat (which I assume was imitation), \"American\" cheese and hollandaise sauce. What exactly is mediteranean about that? Definitely would not recommend this place. If you just want crappy diner food go to the Denny's next door and save yourself some money."}
{"text":"Good food, big portions and things are made to your satisfaction, like our eggs.  The pancake is good, served with what they say is real maple syrup but as a Canadian who knows what real maple syrup tastes like, I don't think it's the real deal.  The service was good as well."}
{"text":"so there really should be two separate listings for the restaurant and the lounge because it's night and day. my friend chose this place to have a quick birthday dinner before a night on the town. the outside of this place looks very outdated and not classy at all. but based on the reviews and the location of this place, we decided to give it a try.

inside is just as worse as it looks on the outside. its like a 1970's ate up the amazon forest and threw it up in here. decor is just horrible. we took a peak inside the Fireside Lounge and at least that part looked a lot better but unfortunately, they don't serve the full menu which was what most of the people in our party wanted. 

anyway, we were seated in a long booth for our party of 9, all facing the same direction which was really awkward so we asked to have a few extra chairs so that we could sit across from each other instead of sitting on a bench and having to yell like we were benchwarmers. luckily the servers were nice enough to let us do that even though we would be blocking the walk way. the menu was pretty extensive, but honestly, it's just like a typical diner. some of us ordered breakfast, some just a salad, some ordered sandwiches. none were spectacular. i shared the gyro sandwiches which came with a side of sweet potato fries for $12. it was OK. 

my review may sound pretty rough but i'll still give it 3 stars because it wasn't too horrible. it's just a glorified Denny's on the Vegas strip...even though that's STILL not saying much. at least the service wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and food in the heart of Las Vegas. Good happy hour with drinks and appetizers. The wings are great, I like them hot. Had The Sinatra which was fantastic. The ambience is always fun and party like. We come here all the time."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS BOMB!!!! My family and I went here for an early morning breakfast! We were very hesitant because of the outside and the inside haha but it was amazing! I ordered the Munches Breakfast and it was perfect. My aunt and fiancée had the Peppermill Pancake and OMG it was awesome! They had pork sausages and bacon that I wish I can make at home. My grandma had the Denver Omelette, of course just a regular omelette, no biggie but everything else was great! HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS SPOT! Oh and can't forget our amazing waitress, Virginia. Very sweet and on top of her service! She deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"On the drive back to LA from Park City, we decide to dine in Vegas and amongst total disagreement over where to eat, Peppermill comes highly recommended to us by one of the girls who had gone rather recently. After rumors circulated in the car that Holly from Girls Next Door dines there often, I assumed it was in the Planet Hollywood or another reputable hotel. Not the case. It is a completely random single-floor standalone restaurant dwarfed on both sides by megacasinos. They did have a private surface parking lot out front though which was convenient. My spirits began to rise again when I saw the interior - a lushly decorated 1980s bonanza of neon lights and big plastic trees...very disorienting, very stimulating, very Vegas. We got a nice big booth by the window and were only temporarily bothered by screaming children. The menu is extremely long and not in a good way. Not only does everything look atherosclerosis-inducing, it's not the guilty pleasure kind of bad food. Also, the alcohol menu is just a jumbled mix of everything - beer alongside cocktails alongside wine, with no explanations. I ordered a Salty Dog thinking it was a beer label I recognized and was rather disappointed to find that it was a vodka-pineapple. My pesto burger was weird but pretty good. To top it all off, they wouldn't let us split the bill, so we endured a long confusing argument with the cashier over how to pay. 

One star for decor, one for the pesto burger. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant we've had visiting Las Vegas this week and we are out every meal.  Tacky decor even for Vegas. Too pricey for the food they serve--even for Vegas. The waitress showed the most skin of anyone or any show we saw in Vegas. Literally her butt cheeks were out and maybe she had a thong on, maybe not!!  We ordered bottled water and they brought us tap water and then bottled water too. The food around us looked good with large portions. But we got a pathetically small burnt burger on hard stale toast with a cup of spoiled mayonnaise. When we told the waitress this is not what we ordered she argued with us instead of trying to make it right. No one tried to make it right.  Also there was sticky pee on the bathroom floor."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends here the last time I was in Vegas. It was the perfect meeting place prior to a night of drinking and debauchery. 

We had a very large group (20+) and the servers were patient with all of us. Ordered the Country Fried Steak breakfast. Portions were huge. I got a generous helping of hash browns along with egg whites. Two huge pieces of country fried steak with sausage gravy all over. The sausage gravy actually had a generous amount of sausage pieces in it. Drinks here are made strong and do not disappoint. 

The look and feel of the place just screams cheesy. Reminds you of the days of old Vegas with the neon everywhere. It is nice to see that not everything has changed. 

If you are not in the mood for a buffet or a high end restaurant, this is the place to go. Me and my friends came here before a night of debauchery but you could also go here to recover as well."}
{"text":"I don't care what people say, this place is the spot. They have some awesome pancakes! Mostly come here after a night out with friends. Although, it's been a while since I've been here, can't go wrong with this place. Drinks AND food at reasonable prices...."}
{"text":"Oh Peppermill, you will always have a place in my heart. This is me and my husbands favorite place in Vegas for breakfast or a late brunch. The food is always consistently good and the service is wonderful. The ladies that have been here for a while already know us by name. They make you feel so at home!"}
{"text":"So apparently The Peppermill is the \"it\" place to go for breakfast/brunch in Vegas. I clearly didn't know this, but thanks to one of my Yelp friends I was in the know. I was hesitant at first to try this place, but I'm glad I took his advice and tried them. I was pretty pleased with this brunch. The staff was extremely nice as well. The one thing I will suggest is going early if you don't want to wait. We got there around 10:30-11:30 (I don't remember exactly) and we had about a 35-45 min wait. They were packed but they do move pretty quick.

I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my husband ordered the Maserati Omelet. The Egg Benedict comes with 3 poached eggs on grilled Canadian bacon and toasted English muffin, topped with Hollandaise sauce, served with hash browns. The dish was so simple but so good. The Eggs were cooked perfect. The Canadian bacon was good as well. It was tender and not salty. Some bacons are salty. The hash browns were cooked perfect but had no flavor. I had to put salt and pepper on my potatoes to jazz them up a little. Once I did that they were ok. 

My husband ordered the Maserati Omelet. It had sausage, Jack and Cheddar cheese, and mushrooms smothered in a perfect Italian meat sauce, sprinkled with Parmesan Cheese. My husband loves mushroom and sausage omelets so this was a no brainer. However, he was a little hesitant about the sauce so he ordered it on the side. He actually liked the sauce with the Omelet so he ate it with the sauce. He said the Omelet was very good and filling. He only ate half the Omelet because it was so big. He said the same thing I said above about the hash browns. He also had a huge pancake. He said it was rubbery and not soft and fluffy. It was not anything special. 

Also with my husband's meal, it came with a choice of muffin. He chose the Cranberry Lemon Muffin. It was amazing!! It was served warm and tasted homemade which I loved. It had cranberries in it with a lemon curd. This was the best muffin I have had from a restaurant. It was just so fresh and flavorful. Definitely try! 

Overall, although The Peppermill was so simple I loved my breakfast. I just wish the hash browns had a little more flavor. The pancake was also not anything special. Other than that, I enjoyed The Peppermill and thought it was a good suggestion."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic example of retro Vegas that stayed retro. The menu is not reinventing the wheel but all the food is always quality. They may have the worst waitress uniforms in history but there fun and the people watching is great. It's like a must visit in Vegas spot."}
{"text":"Been a regular customer since 2004. Anything on the menu you can't wrong especially the pancakers or the steaks."}
{"text":"Located next to Riveria Hotel which has recently closed. We went for happy hour 3-6pm and I love the fireside lounge..dim and romantic. Only 5 booths there that seats two so get there early. There is a restaurant too. We ordered Peppemill martini and Creamsicle that was good and taste like orange cream icecream :) for food Buffalo wings that was tasty and crispy and Brushetta which was ok. 

The reason for 3 stars are the place was too smoky and they played country music and sports so basically a country's sports bar which doesn't suit the ambience. 

It is a nice place to take some friends who visits Vegas."}
{"text":"This was the first time in a long time that I've been here.  I love this place, the only reason I quit going was because they had it so cold in the fireside lounge area, that I felt like I was in Alaska....But went there to meet my relatives!  And it was very comfortable.  So it felt good to get that famous Scorpian!  It was awsome.  The admostfere is great for hanging with friends!"}
{"text":"Wow, I really haven't written a review about this joint yet?  I'm pretty surprised.

This place surprises me.. so unassuming on the outside, you can literally drive past it a thousand times and not notice it's there.. inside it looks like old school, tacky vegas threw up in here.  Vintage plastic colorful booths, neon lights trace the ceilings, faux trees coming out of the booths... wow.  

There's also a fireside lounge which is all the rage, but I normally stumble into this joint on my very last hours of Vegas, tired, drained and out of cash, so I never have the time to check out the fireside lounge.

This place is known for their large 24 hour portions of breakfast.  They also serve lunch and dinner though.

There's an entire page of omelets.  Not a fan of the seafood omelet consisting mostly of fake seafood product and tasting slightly fishy.  I had better luck this time around w/the Maserati omelet filled w/jack and cheddar cheeses, mushrooms and smothered in italian meat sauce.  Very hearty, but def could've used more meat smotherin' since its a massive fluffy omelet. It's almost like a wall/brick of egg, so u need a lot of extras for all that egg.  I can't imagine how many eggs it takes to make one order.  All come w/hashbrowns, and your choice of either toast, or english muffin, or bagel or fresh blue berry muffin.  That's a lot of freakin' food!!! 

You can also order some alcoholic bevs from the alcoholic waitress (heh) I had a mimosa given to me in a sangria glass.  Not very stiff, but still enjoyable w/my meal.

Honestly, I'm never really the biggest fan of diners.. so if it weren't for my bf's tradition of ending vegas trips here, I probably wouldn't have come back a second time.... but w/its unique environment, nostalgia, heaping portions of food, so so prices, i can see how it would be considered a good diner."}
{"text":"So glad we found this spot. We are regulars who have been doing Las Vegas trips for years and I had heard about this once on a TV show and really wanted to check it out. The fire pit room is very cozy, and the main dining area really is special! It almost feels like you're in a jungle, they have lots of plants around. Must stop here if you're visiting and looking for delicious food and cool ambiance!"}
{"text":"This is a funky Vegas spot for a late night dinner or early drunken breakfast. I cane here after landing late in Vegas. I was here for a conference and this place is walking distance from my hotel. The service was good, everyone was friendly. I ordered a BLT with Avocado and fries. The bacon was crispy and the avocado was ripe and creamy. Overall this was exactly what I wanted late at night."}
{"text":"Go where the locals go...DUH!

Trust me and the other people who review this place, its way better than going to Denny's, IHOP or any place to get late night food.
Its not hard to find, its right on the strip, not too far from the WYNN/Encore Hotel. Basically in between Sahara & Spring Mountain streets.
Portions are big, and everything's not too bad for the price.
Fireside lounge is cute...kinda romantic?
The main restaurant decor is of course semi cheesy but I like it, it kind of lets you know...your really in Vegas hahaha.

So far I think one of my favorites off the menu is the Peppermill Pastrami Burger 11.95
YUM!
Also if you ever get hash browns try it with cheese and country gravy  on top. For some reason that combination tastes really good when you've been drinking =D

By the way....just the head's up... its CROWDED on a friday/saturday night, hahaha but that's already a given."}
{"text":"from the outside this place looks like a gay bar, but from the inside a seedy yet classy 80s strip club haha. when we were leaving vegas and this was the place my boyfriend's sister took us before we left i was a little thrown off. the fire pit is gnarly and the decor is so tacky but pretty awesome. the food was surprisingly good (insanely delicious if you're still a little drunk or hungover). big portions and everything you could want from food to booze. i would definitely recommend giving it a try when youre in vegas. i promise you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Everything is overpriced, but what can you expect from a place on the strip?  The entrees are delicious but absolutely huge, and I'd be happier paying slightly less if they gave me even half of what they normally do.  That would increase their profit margin :)  Their $8 Chocolate milkshake is the best!"}
{"text":"I only had drinks an appetizers in the lounge but it was perfect for what we were looking for. We had their sampler platter, which was a bunch of fried food and tasted like the fried food from anywhere. The real treat of this place is the atmosphere. It's very \"classic\" vegas with giant lounge chairs, bright colors and lights. The woman helping us was also great. She didn't rush us along but checked in frequently enough that we didn't feel ignored."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so ... Vegas, in all good and tacky senses.

THE ATMOSPHERE:
It feels like cheers bar for locals meets las Vegas disco ball. Homey, delicious, friendly.

THE DECOR:
Being inside is like stepping direcrly into a neon lined disco ball. There is disco glass all over the pillars and ceilings, only to be distracted by the giant TV screens and neon lighting lining everything. There is a cool lounge in the back area, but we opted for the bustling brunch in the restaurant in the front. Think Denny's on a flamboyant gay cruise in the 80's and you kinda have Peppermill, except with fantastic food and gigantic portions.

I fell in love with the decor big time. Each table is a booth, which I love, and has big leather couches. It's arranged so you aren't hidden, but each table has their own little alcove. Like a buncha totally-visible secret gardens or something. Maybe i say garden because there are giant fake trees throughtout, and flowers and vines at each table draping down from the ceiling. Also, big flamingo Tiffany's -esque lamps hover over each table with a full moon, making it almost seem like you're watching a flock of flamingoes grazing at night. It's almost peaceful. 

THE FOOD:
The coffee, so necessary after any 1/2-decent night out in Vegas, is Columbian and served in a big cup with free refills. All about it.

My friends and I shared:
1) Munch's breakfast, which was sautéed peppers, onions, and linguica sausage over hash browns with 2 eggs any way on top. It was good, and huge, but nothing to write home about.
2) Maserati omelette - this is Meaty-tomato italian sauce, melted jack and cheddar cheeses, hasbrowns. Served with toast, a bagel, or a muffin. This was fantastic. I would never think that spaghetti sauce would pair well with an omelette, but this was excellent and worth ordering. 

With your meal comes a free 4x6 photo souveneir -- so cheezy, so Vegas, so perfect. I loved it and treasure it as a memory of that weekend.

Finally, there's colored sugar. I know, whoopee, but it just tells you what kinda place this is. It's vegas. there are no rules. have fun and roll with it!

In all, we spent $44 for 3 coffees and 2 breakfast meals and tip. A bit pricy but perfect for sopping up your last night and making you a functional human being again.

Will definitely be adding this to my Vegas rotations."}
{"text":"I really don't get the hype over this place.  My wife and I went here for breakfast at about 10am because of the outstanding reviews.  It's typical old-school Vegas gaudy and very crowded. We waited an hour and 20 minutes on a weekday to be seated (now lunch-time) but were looking forward to the food because of the reviews.  They offered us cocktails while we waited (at 10am?  Well, it's Vegas, I guess).

First, the service was excellent.  The waitress was hustling and she kept up with all of her tables.  She was also very polite and attractive.

But that was where the good points ended.

 I got the corned-beef hash because it seemed to be one of the highest rated breakfast dishes.  Where I live, I'm used to corned-beef hash being fresh corned-beef sliced thin and layered over oven-roasted potatoes with sauteed onions and peppers and poached/basted eggs.  I was happily anticipating this sort of dish based on how stellar the reviews were.  Instead, I got a HUGE bowl of what seemed to be Hormel corned beef hash from a can with two basted eggs plopped on top.  Other than the minced potatoes mixed in with the copious amounts of \"meat\" and 4 slices of fresh (but well refrigerated) green tomato as a garnish, there were absolutely no vegetables.

I'm no stellar cook, but I would not serve food of this quality (or lack thereof) to guests at my home, let alone try to pass it off as a dish in a restaurant.  I also thought the size was overkill.  I HATE wasting food, particularly meat, but as a normal large (NOT fat) man, I was only able to eat about 1/3 of this dish and still walked away uncomfortably full, and being on a trip was not able to take any home with me (sad).

I can only surmise that the people who rate this place 4 and 5 stars are:

a. rating service only.
b. into \"all you can eat\" style dining.
c. tourists from places with nothing resembling a decent restaurant.

Sorry, but it was big waste of time and money.  You're much better off finding a greasy-spoon off the strip and eating something tastier, cheaper, and MUCH quicker."}
{"text":"What a great place. If you want to get a feel for Las Vegas, then come here. This place has been here since the 1970's (I think) and it's pretty awesome. It's a 24/7 diner type of place that has great diner food. Had a breakfast plate when I was there last time and it was terrific, the service was great, too. Plus, they did an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffees here. It can get loud in here with all the drunk people who come through, but it's a great place to go if you want to get that \"Vegas\" experience. Hey, they have 9/6 JoB here!!"}
{"text":"So part 2 of our Las Vegas journey starts with the end cap of night 3 which was going to the Peppermill at 2 in the morning. Now who does this? Well when you TripAdvisor or YELP anything food 24 hour in Vegas the Peppermill is #1. It's historic and legendary amongst Vegas locals. The exterior was a sight to be hold and the inside was even better.

Trees, booths, lights, sights and sounds of the Vegas nightlife crowd. After a long day of hanging out, walking, shows, the Peppermill was a comfort to say the least. The food was the best part, now you must get steak and eggs, DOH! It was simply the best."}
{"text":"Yummy. I'm so full & happy. Huge servings. The decor is really cool too. Totally Las Vegas. Open 24/7. 
Friendly staff. Fast service & again really good food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and both times it has been great. Drinks are huge, food is excellent and service is good. Reasonably priced too. Love, love, love the kitchy, classic Vegas experience it offers too. Romantic circular booths and the fire pit in the bar make this a fun and romantic place for me and my honey when we are dining on the Strip."}
{"text":"Great place. Lots of history. But poor customer service. My server was Liliya last night. I specifically told her not to run my credit card because I was paying cash, and she still ran it. I told her twice. When I paid in cash, she never brought me my change and just logged off and ended her shift."}
{"text":"I  love this place for what it is!  Cheesy decor, good late night eats, drinks  and friendly service, and for me memories of trips to Vegas as a child where this was our breakfast spot before heading back to CA.  Our party of six arrived at about 11 on a Saturday night and were quickly seated.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict and while they weren't the most amazing version of Eggs Benedict I ever had they were tasty and with three eggs and hash browns included more then enough for one person.  I would highly recommend the Key Lime Pie Martini.  Delicious and tasted just like the desert with a graham cracker crust  rim.  A photographer came by and offered to take \"free\" pictures of our group with no obligation.  Of course to upgrade to a nice full size photo without the Peppermill logos all over turned into $10 but it was a nice memento of the evening and easily scanned and divided among six of us!"}
{"text":"Oh my God I totally love this place, it's open late, always ready to cook a good meal I absolutely love my waitress Carolynn she is awesome and every time we come here we request to sit at her table cause she's the bomb. . ."}
{"text":"my boyfriend & i went here because we saw it on Anthony Bourdain.  though, i noticed it several times when in vegas.  

we tried:
Tomato Stack (mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, balsamic reduction)
Southern Fried Steak (comes with mashed potatoes & steamed veggies)
Burger with bacon & onion rings

everything was pretty good.  i'd probably stop here again after a late night at a strip club.  they're open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Most people who visit from out of town are familiar with the Peppermill in one way or another. Maybe seen in a movie or a music video or just the fact that they have a large menu with large portions. The Fireside lounge is always a must see and why not sit and have a cocktail, they do have an award winning Bloody Mary table and this helps pass the time if you are waiting for a table. It still has that bright neon in a dark environment old school Vegas look that it had since it opened in the 70's.
The food here is also worth the visit. I always seem to get the breakfast and nothing better than some eggs and a ham steak that can feed a family. With having tried many different breakfast options this is one of my favorite places to take friends to when they visit for that hang over remedy or just visit with friends on a random weekend."}
{"text":"Just go you'll  love it it's too funky and cool to miss.
Don't forget the lounge the fit pit is the height of 1970's cool..."}
{"text":"What an awesome place!!  I'd give it five stars if I had the chance to eat here.  We just hung out and drank beer for a bit.  I will revisit!!!"}
{"text":"Long wait, pretty pricy.... large portions of food but not very good. Save some cash if u want breakfast and go to IHOP"}
{"text":"A decent breakfast joint with a old diner feel. The servers are good and efficient. The restaurant is relatively clean. The coffee was brewed hot and fresh. It's free flowing which is nice. They had very unique rainbow sugar I ordered the country fried steak and eggs. The three eggs were done to my liking, over easy. The steak was crispy in the outside and tender on the inside. The gravy was delicious. Very good over all. The hash brown pieces were cut thick and it was only a little bit crispy. I don't really like potato soft so this wasn't a hit for me. The portions are huge though. I could barely eat half of it. It also comes toast or muffin. It's a quick turnaround place and has a homey feel. The corned beef hash was a bit on the oily side but still very tasty."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is beautiful. My friend and I sat fire side as we sipped on martinis and shared an appetizer. She got the chocolate chip martini which was delicious, tasted like a milkshake. I got the Skooby Doo martini blended, this was a little bland or flavorless. Appetizers were generic, nothing outrageous. Overall, this place is a must see for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We needed a little lunch to hold us over before dinner, so we split a cheeseburger and fries. They were happy to let us split (a lot of places are not so cool with it anymore). The burger and fries were great! Cooked perfect, tasty, yummy!"}
{"text":"Server Gabby was on point.  Service 5.
 
Great retro feel. 5 

HUGE menu.  
Food quality 2+. 

Been eating here for 18 yrs on and off.  Big portions, smaller now than yrs ago.  Food quality has gone down.  Sent back the raw soggy fries and limp cold onion rings had to wait way too long for replacement but Manager handled it excellent.  

Recommended for tourists."}
{"text":"AWESOME food, people, and environment! They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner 24 hours a day! The portions are HUGE and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Of all the restaurants I have been to in Las Vegas, I have never been to one that so perfectly captures the essence of the Vegas Strip. The exterior of the building looks rather unassuming aside from the neon \"Peppermill\" sign at the front, but once you walk through those doors you are officially in Vegas. The amount of neon lights is just unreal! The 50's diner/tropical oasis combo is something I am sad to have gone my 25 year life without experiencing. There are flamingos everywhere, and their tableside sugar is rainbow colored! If all of this doesn't scream Vegas to you, then all of the hungover/still partying people dining alongside you will!
This was our stop for breakfast before leaving Vegas on Sunday morning. Standard breakfast fare, but giant portions! I had the eggs bennie which was delicious! My husband had the biscuits and gravy that even a human vacuum like himself could not finish. My dad had the ham and eggs with a slice of ham bigger than his face.
The wait staff was really wonderful. Very quick and helpful. Overall, I truly enjoyed dining here and cannot wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Wow is this place out there. It looks cool inside but it's grungy and smells like vomit. I mean it severely smells like vomit. The food is Denys quality and great if your drunk and it's late."}
{"text":"Good friendly service. The food? Meh. As another Yelpper said, just a couple steps up from Denny's. My caesar salad was basic and my shrimp scampi was just ok. My fault for not reading the description, I thought it was a pasta dish. The shrimp were well cooked, but I've had better scampi sauce. It came with what appeared to be instant rice and some veggies. Again, it was ok, but not a $25 plate of food. Definitely stick to the appetizers and bar foods. Try the potato wedges--those were really good with the bacon bits in the middle smothered in cheese!"}
{"text":"Coffee cups are tall and filled to the top but unfortunately weak... Food is good but it's the old Vegas atmosphere that makes this place so....Vegas! Good old diner fare served in large portions.  The sugar crystals on the table are multi-colored and there are faux trees and neon lights throughout.  The bar is awesome with a fire pit and music.  Of course, there are slot machines at the entrance!  You have to do it at least once while in town!"}
{"text":"Fun, old school, old Vegas diner/restaurant.  This place screams kitsch, and that is wonderful.  The neon, the bar girl in basically a gown, the girl taking pictures.  It's all such a fun ride.

They also have a huge menu filled with all kinds of delicious selections.  We had a hungry group of 5 guys and started with the sampler.  Mozzarella sticks, onion rings, chicken fingers, it was all delicious.

I got myself a pastrami burger.  Just how it sounds, a huge juicy burger with a nice heap of pastrami on top.  Absolutely wonderful, and completely filling.  I did leave a few bites and some fries, I'm sorry it was big.

The place is great though.  Lots of parking, but it does fill up.  Not too far from the hotels, but walking back might be a problem with that food coma coming on."}
{"text":"This place was very cool. I stepped in to the lounge to grab a drink looks like a great place you could just hang. We ate in the restaurant and the food was good and the service was great. Try it you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"What's not to like:
Neon lights.
Sparkly trees.
Slot machines in the waiting area.
Stained-glass lamps.

The Peppermill is a well-known diner open 24 hours.  They serve giant plates of grub as well as all-day breakfast, but people really come to Peppermill for the disco-diner decor. What a unique-looking place and I am glad I finally got to try it!  I also liked how even though it was quite busy the server didn't try to hurry is to leave - lol.  Note that they are closed the week of Labor Day for remodeling.  I can't wait to see what it'll look like as it looks pretty rad as is.  (I asked the cashier, and she said she had no idea what they have planned and she'll have to walk into work and find out the new look like everyone else...lol)."}
{"text":"Pretty fun and unique experience. Great selection of drinks and food. Big portions! We had a Bloody Mary, light on the condiments in it, but tasty. Mimosa was a good size and good flavor despite a non know champagne."}
{"text":"Loved the food, got the nachos and the plate was huge! Awesome environment, wish they still had a restaurant in fresno"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on our way out of town after a friend recommended.  

I think I expected too much - it was just ok.  

Portions were large, but my bloody mary was awful.  I got Eggs Benedict (was pretty good), husband got Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs, which he didn't come close to finishing - said it was not that great.

Atmosphere was SUPER COOL, service was ok and food was ok.  I'll give it another try next time we're in Vegas, and will definitely check out the Fireside Lounge."}
{"text":"This place is so neon and retro! Booths, cute cocktail waitresses, fake trees, and a wide ranged of signature drinks? i'm in. They're one of the oldest restaurants in vegas which is so cool! Open 24 hours, it kind of gives me a strip club vibe not going to lie but very worth checking out and dining! 

We came at around 3AM on Saint Patrick day after going to downtown fremont and let me tell you it was packed! There was a gigantic parking lot but it does still get packed. I was so amazed because i have never been here before and there was so many people early in the morning! Everyone was drunk so the customers were all so happy and the crazy thing was we waited for only 5 minutes and got called to sit at a table so they clean up super fast! When we sat down we looked through the menu and ordered. Our server was so nice and the food came out pretty fast too but let me tell you.. the portion is HUGE like the \"appetizers\" might as well be the entree. 

There was a lot of cocktail drinks and someone comes to each table and asks for your order but unfortunately we were drunk enough after fremont so we opted out. I loved this whole set up environment it felt so cozy and a good change of scenery from modern dining. There's also a 3 color SUGAR sprinkle on the table, don't think it was salt like me!

What we ordered: 

Mushroom Swiss Burger: The burger itself was so juicy but my complaint is that it was so soggy on the bottom so the burger was falling apart so for the first time ever i didn't finish my burger!! it was a deal breaker. But i have a love for onion rings and there's is soooo crunchy and battered perfectly they give you a big portion and the option to choose what side you wanted as well! (Medium rare cooked) 

Nachos Nachos Nachos: This thing is HUGE it should be illegal to say this is a appetizer. It comes out in 2 dishes and it was so cheesy. It was 3 colored chips with 2 meats and tomatoes and olives etc

I think this place deserves to be called a Las Vegas gem i'm so happy historic places like this still exists and locals should support businesses like this one to be around for a long time. In a city filled with modernization and constant new buildings and casino being built it's good we still have this oldie."}
{"text":"We meet some friends at Peppermill for a late breakfast. I love that this place serves breakfast all day. 

We had drinks in the lounge while we waited for our table. Everyone loved the retro 80s atmosphere. 

The only downside to the whole experience was the wait for the table. Well, there are two downsides. They don't have vegetarian dishes on the menu, so one of us had to order a specialized item.

Our food came out very quickly. The waitress did miss a few items and had to run back a few time, but she got quickly. 

Overall we had a great experience."}
{"text":"Do not sit at the counter. Very slow service.

Very generous portion sizes.
This place is pretty much a must brunch place if you go to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place looks like a pink-n-purple disco spaceship landed upon a garden and decided to serve food to the denizens of Las Vegas. It doesn't have the most amazing food I've ever eaten, but its fun atmosphere makes up for any culinary shortcomings.

The service was quick and friendly, and our drinks were always kept full to the brim. Bonus points for the huge cups of coffee (at least by diner standards) and the shakers of multi-colored granulated sugar. I think everyone in our group had breakfast food and concurred that while the egg dishes were on the so-so side, the tasty hash browns and liberal portions of toast/bagels/muffins negated that.

This is an excellent place to get some good, reasonably priced diner food that didn't come from a Denny's."}
{"text":"Hungover and this is the SPOT. Located down near Circus Circus but worth the drive if you are on the strip. (I was staying at PH) the food is incredible. Your typical dinner freshness. I ordered the bacon breakfast with eggs, hash browns and toast. AMAZING! Now I'm only rating this 4 because our waitress was a bit passive aggressive. But overall this place is so yummy when you wanna get away from the pizza, burger feel you usually get from Vegas. Good homemade food!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Dry toast on burger, greasy onion rings. Kids didn't eat their food at all and just ate one piece of my toast. I asked the waitress to remake my meal and she called the manager. The manager said because a piece of toast was eaten he couldn't  re make it. Are you freaking  kidding me!!!!!! This place is a joke!!!!! Ruined my first night in Vegas, thank you jerks!!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Anthony Bourdain. I get this place. I am now a fan for life."}
{"text":"I don't get to Vegas much anymore. I did drive there yesterday. A have been coming to this restaurant for years. I go at least once every trip. It's old and usually crowded and noisy. I like that in this case because...it's Las Vegas! All tourists from what I can tell and there's nothing wrong with that. I'm a tourist after all. I always get an omelette no matter what time of day it is. The waitresses are competent and that's fine. The price is not that high at all. Parking is easy but can be crowded. I like the place. They seemed to have eliminated the Maserati Omelette from the menu though. Bummer. Maybe I just missed seeing it. Had a Denver and it was great."}
{"text":"Keep it simple with your order and be cool to the staff lol

3.5 for the fireplace but not nearly as nice as I remembered but sold place to get your late night or pre-game grub on.

Heck I should just give them 5 stars cuz the fireplace closes the deal every time!!!! Luck be a lady tonight ;)"}
{"text":"We came here for a late dinner last night. I was pleased to find out that they served breakfast all day.  I had pancakes, eggs over easy, bacon and sausage.   My husband had chicken fried steak, eggs over easy and hashbrowns and a bagel.  Serving sizes are huge and things are overpriced.   Our waitress wasn't great and not very attentive. I felt like she kept forgetting about us.   For food alone, I would have given them a 4 but the service is why I gave them a 3.  The decor in this place is hilarious."}
{"text":"I love the vibe up in here. It's old school diner meets the Vegas downlow.
Great cocktails. Plenty of servers even if they aren't that good.
The menu is not typical Vegas fare.
It popped in my head, I'd love a greasy pastrami sandwich, but my body was also craving iron (probably not the best time to go to Vegas, drink like a fiend, while Aunt Martha's in town, but I can't control everything - just gotta go with the flow...literally), so I also wanted a burger.
Lo and behold, this joint had a burger topped with pastrami and cheese, and was sure I had somehow fallen into a hangover dream where my fantasy would soon be shocked back into reality with some shitty meat atop my dry gross burger - BUT it was not.
Win! Win! This sandwhich has made a footprint in my mind and I will have it everytime I visit Vegas...I will fly to Vegas for this sandwich. It was INSANE and I can only try to duplicate it at home.
If only I could find a man who appreciated the pastrami burger as much as myself, my life would be complete.
oooh, my mouth just watered. 

And the lounge...for those sexy, I just want to look at you while I get my Vegas drunk on. It's just dark enough."}
{"text":"Classic Vegas steakhouse. We had a large group and they handled us perfectly. Great service. Nice food. Pretty large helpings. An all around fun experience."}
{"text":"Best biscuits and gravey you will find anywhere. But i could say that of nearly everything on the menu. You will wait to get in, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"really cool environment, gotta have the choco banana! its a must when you come here!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot on the strip!  30 minute wait for a table?  No problem, there's an in house bar/lounge that makes the wait fly by.  The beers and cocktails definitely help the time go as well.  Big plate of good food for a decent price.  Check it out."}
{"text":"You have to eat a BLT sandwich, it was so good. It comes with a fried egg in it. So delicious. I'm definitely going back every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't know what others have eaten here, but the eggs Benedict are average at best.

Believe it or not but for less money you can eat at the Grand Lux Café in the Venetian and get much much better coffee and food!!!

I have eaten in both and will be back to the Venetian!"}
{"text":"Drinks in lounge are great. Always a good choice . Best after hours grub. Can't beat the taste early in the morning after being out all night . It's a classic"}
{"text":"Our first time at the Peppermill Restaurant was a great experience. The Hostess greeted us as we walked in. She seated us and the Carolyn then took our drink orders. She was very professional and friendly. The restaurant has an old style Las Vegas Feel with velvet booths and lots of lights and glass. The food was served quickly and was very good. The steak was cooked perfect and so was the Burgers. The price was about average and I would recommend the Peppermill Restaurant to anyone that would like a well cooked meal."}
{"text":"AMAZING

All their drinks are enormous and you can sit by the fire in the dark at 3 in the afternoon. I want to get married here. And then I want to move in."}
{"text":"5 stars for being the best breakfast spot in Vegas...seriously why have I never been here before?

I was warned of the harsh purple and neon lighting before I walked in, but I kind of enjoyed it more than hated it. This place screams Vegas. 

I pieced together my meal, side of scrambled eggs, side of hash browns and a fruit platter. Portions were ridiculous. The eggs were freshly scrambled, the potatoes nice and crisp. A bottle of cholula on the table makes me happy, who needs tabasco?!?

Friends all loved their meals. Giant stuffed feta cheese omelets and a big bowl of what looked to be everything in the kitchen scrambled and topped with fried eggs. I heard the bran muffin was pretty tasty as well.

Service was great and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best place hands down! Never disappoint. Friendly staff and large portions. The cocktail list is great as well!"}
{"text":"Portion is huge. Located northside of the strip across from Circus Circus. The decor was rather eclectic and too dark for my taste. Diner is opened 24/7 so you can have breakfast any time you wish."}
{"text":"Let's discuss the Peppermill Restaurant side first, because I feel like you have two totally different experiences in the same business depending on whether you are headed to the restaurant or the lounge.

The Peppermill Restaurant--So, the decor is a little tacky---what isn't tacky about Las Vegas though???  Really???  You walk in to a restaurant and you see neon rainbow lights, slot machines, dogwood trees and waitresses dressed up in skittles colored uniforms.  The visual entertainment alone is enticing enough for me to go there time and time again.  Even the sugar on the table is rainbow colored.

The food portions are humongous and I think if you are an average eater, you can get one meal and split it with someone and both of you would walk out full and content.  The food is pretty good, I wouldn't say that it's the best--but again---you're paying for the experience.  The prices are a little bit higher than an average family restaurant but, hey---someone has to pay for the electricity that's used in lighting up those colorful neon lights.  =0)  The service has always been great every time that I've gone.  So, give the restaurant side a try.

However--should you decide to pass the Peppermill Restaurant up---DO NOT pass up the opportunity to experience the Fireside Lounge.  Not everyone knows, but the Fireside Lounge was actually used in a scene for the movie Casino with Robert Deniro and Sharon Stone.  Apparently, Deniro hung out there during the filming of the movie and he liked it so much that they decided to use it as a scene in the movie.  Aside from the movie trivia attached to this lounge, the experience is truly unique.  I would say that it's quite romantic and great for dates and especially a first date.  If you end up getting a little toasty around the fire on the velvet red couches, there are other areas in the lounge that offer secluded areas for private conversation.  The area is pretty dim and it's got the nightlife feel to it.  So, give it a try!!  And take a few pictures for us!!!

{"text":"So different. Portions were generous and wait staff was extremely pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Peppermill is an iconic spot in vegas! The hidden Fireside Lounge is a MUST!

Whether you're visiting or a local it's worth have a meal or drink at.
The portions are huge here, I recommend coming for breakfast food either in the morning or stumble in after the clubs to sober up. I've dined her for lunch multiple times and had their soup & half sandwich special.

Food Recommendations: 
Anything breakfast! They all come with fresh toast and smothered in butter... so good. 
Oatmeal (it's giant... i mean GIANT comes with all toppings on the size and decent priced)
Caprese pesto sandwich is very generous with the fresh mozzarella slices. 

FIRESIDE LOUNGE just to the left of the host booth is the entrance to lounge. It does have a dress code of no flip flop, no hats, no shorts i believe. It's a dark little hide away lounge with tons of trees and leaves between each of the large round booths, theres mirrors and neon lights  everywhere, and theres an awesome blue water/rock fire pit with a booth surrounding the whole area thats more of a community seating area for cocktails. They offer a smaller appetizer only menu and full drink menu."}
{"text":"My uncle is visiting from out of town so we decided to take him to an old landmark!! Peppermill. The service is perfect!! Clean restaurant. Excellent cocktails. Great food!! If you are looking for good prices and huge portions!! Yes yes we loved it"}
{"text":"Called to see the wait time and they told us 30 min then went in three minutes later and a white older Caucasian woman says \"well that was then this is now so\" .... completely rude, attitude unnecessary and then they acted like I didn't call. So I showed them the call time stamp (3 minutes). Customer service, please have that woman work on it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, food comes out quick and the salad is really filling, tons of portion sizes, onion rings are amazing as well, plus it has a great 80s vibe and cool lights"}
{"text":"All I can say is, whoa, what the hell was this place?  

We roll in around 11:00 AM on a Saturday for a late breakfast, but the line is out the door.  My buddy suggests we grab a cocktail in the lounge while we wait.  What the heck, it's Vegas, right?

We roll into the lounge and all of the waitresses are wearing full length evening gowns, there is techno music playing, and the dimly lit lounge is lined with mirrors on all the walls and adorned with thousands of silk flowers, wines and plants.  Do I love it or do I hate it?   Cutting edge or tacky?  I'm still not sure.

Why three stars?  Well, in the end, the caipirinha I ordered was too sweet and not lime-y enough, and the sandiwch I ordered at lunch was just ok."}
{"text":"One of my favorite photos is of a group of my very closest friends wearing wigs and sharing cauldron of alcohol at a booth in the Fireside Lounge. It was the night before my wedding. Our props were impressive--a set of hillbilly teeth fabricated by my friend's orthodontic stepdad, bolas, dreds and curly blond wigs. These luxurious party materials, and the classic Vegas setting of Fireside lounge, set the stage for a full evening of bacchanalia that (we thought) would leave us too tired to party like rock stars the following evening for the main event. If anything, it fueled the fire.

I go to Fireside lounge to enjoy its big red booths and to sit and mingle. Many a fun nights start or finish at this strip location. The free nuts can partially undo a spontaneous alcohol binge. 

Unfortunately Fireside installed TVs in all the booths a few years ago, which diminishes its classic and intimate appeal. Why turn the fireside lounge into a showcase for music videos? That's why I can't give it five stars. 

Still, Fireside is a must-see Vegas attraction."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a meal when you've had enough of the casinos.  Old school diner vibe, but with a splash of Vegas flash.  The food's decent as well."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is absolutely my favorite place to stay in Reno, so when we asked someone for a breakfast recommendation in Las Vegas last weekend, I was happy to jump on the suggestion of heading to Peppermill LV. We were cutting it pretty close to having to be at the airport, but had roughly an hour so the 20 minute wait didn't scare us off.

We sat at the bar and each enjoyed a couple of frozen, blended, strawberry drinks (about $12 each) and lots of conversation with the bartenders and waitresses picking up drinks, before our name was called and we were seated. A coffee ($4) was brought quickly and orders were taken fast too. Everything was off to a great start! 

My boyfriend ordered an omelette and hashbrowns for brunch. I ordered 3 eggs over-medium ($4), a bowl of country gravy, and a side of onion rings to dip in the gravy and egg yolk. I know, I know...  kinda weird but the rings on the table next too us looked too good to miss. Food finally came out (HUGE omelette and plate of hash $14!!) - everything arrived but the onion rings - which we were told would be there soon. So I ate my eggs. And then a bowl of gravy with a spoon. As I finished the last bite, we received another apology from Sophia for the untimeliness (still no rings) so at this point, since we'd finished eating, I begrudgingly had her cancel the order.  No offer to bring them out in a to-go box or anything...! Shouldn't they be almost done? I was really disappointed they messed up my breakfast order and did nothing to fix it. I had nothing to dip in my eggs or gravy, yet was still charged for the $3 side, which I ended up having to eat by eatself! No offer for toast.... anything?! Luckily, the airport was close so we had more food and drinks there while waiting for our delayed flight.

I totally understand when something goes wrong in a kitchen, or there's a miscommunication with staff, but in most instances, the best thing to do is not make the customer suffer as a result. If they cooked the onion rings anyway, all I can imagine is maybe they'd rather keep them for themselves than give them up for free to a hungry customer - from the way they looked on the table next to us, that's probably what happened. I imagine they're delicious! Very surprising coming from a place that staples a comment card to your receipt."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and always for breakfast.  Needless to say on those days, I did not need to eat lunch!  HUGE portions at a reasonable price.  Great place to come after a bender.  Will go back next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went here about a month ago.. Atmosphere Is like you're living on the set of the golden girls which I absolutely love! The food was great I had the eggs Benedict probably the best eggs Benedict I have had in a while. 
The only thing that I have to complain about is the wait it took for us to be seated... Have no fear they have a full bar and fire pit to keep you entertained while you wait... James the bartender was AMAZING!!!!! He had great recommendations and was up for the challenge of being our bartender!!!! Overall, this was a great place and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here on every single trip I make to Las Vegas and usually make it a priority to come here at least a few times per trip. The prices are good for Las Vegas standards, but the portions are enormous! This place is colorful and something you would never see back home. I love coming here late at night (or early morning) and having eggs Benedict with a cocktail or 2, because hey it's Vegas! Whenever a friend of mine is planning on a trip to Vegas I always recommend going here as a must!"}
{"text":"This was our favorite restaurant in Vegas! Open all night and serves breakfast 24/7. How can you go wrong with a place like this? Seems this is a locals dig, so if you're up for spotting celebrities, your odds are pretty good. Fun place to hang and just people watch. Great cocktails, coffee and food.

Reasonable prices (yes, even in Vegas) and a huge menu. If you don't mind eating in a rather garish looking place (think upscale stripper club), you'll be very pleased with the grub. We went there several times during our trip to Vegas and were never disappointed."}
{"text":"I felt like steak but didn't want to pay $60-$100 for the meal eating at a Steakhouse on the Vegas Strip. My buddy found this place through Yelp and we thought WTH....  I had a pretty large and very decent Porterhouse, the French onion soup was adequate, and the mushrooms were actually really good. Didn't touch the mashed potatoes because I didn't want to fill up valuable stomach space but they piled it high on my plate. All that food for 35 bucks? Heck yeah! The service was great. Our server Crystal was very friendly and Johnny-on-the-spot with drink refils. This place definitely makes Strip based steakhouses feel way over priced. We certainly will be going back to Peppermills"}
{"text":"Visited here after seeing it on a TV show. Wasn't disappointed.

Portions here seem to be quite large for most menu items. My french toast ambrosia could have fed a couple of people. It was really good, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes french toast and fruit. I noticed that other patrons of the restaurant were often taking doggie bags with them. I would have, had I had any time before returning home to eat my leftovers.

The beer selection wasn't very good, so I wouldn't recommend the place if you're looking for beer. It was a bit strange, too, when ordering. Someone came to take the drink order, but couldn't bring beer, so they sent over a cocktail waitress. There was yet another waitress that handled the food. Strange, but not a big deal.

The environment here is sort of fun, with lots of fake plant decorations everywhere."}
{"text":"The portions are huuuuuge!  The menu is extensive. Ther service is great.  24 hr breakfast.  You'll spend between $10-20 per person, but you can share a meal and still have plenty.  We really like this place. Very casual. Ok to wear shorts."}
{"text":"Food was good until we saw a big cockroach on the kitchen counter. Then another on the floor. The guy in the booth next to us stepped on one."}
{"text":"Located in between the Riviera and the newly built construction of Echelon Place along the Vegas Strip. This restaurant will take you back to the retro age. A 70's neon vintage diner, which includes purple velvet booths completing the groovy vibe is the Fireside Lounge/Bar in another part of the establishment. Where else can you find a circular fireplace? Let's just say this is a stationary limo where the choices of specialty cocktails are abundant.

As awesome as the ambience is, let's get down (no pun intended) to the real reason this place is a must in spending time in Vegas. The food is great. Wide selection, huge portions (A-muuuur-ri-cuh), and ridiculous affordable prices. 

\"They\" say that Vegas is a  24 Hour town, but that is sooo wrong, especially when you're in the city with friends and pull a Strip Crawl and need something to sober you up at 3 or 4 in the morning. Peppermill is open 24HOURS!!!! 

If you're on a budget this is the place to go to indulge."}
{"text":"It's been 32 years since I've been here and it hasn't changed. Even the uniforms are the same albeit different colors. Excellent as expected. Great job, Peppermill! Thx"}
{"text":"August 3, 2014

Peppermill, I have heard of you and I have been told that you serve the best breakfast food. And now, finally, I was able to experience you first hand. And here I my verdict, Peppermill- I am in love with you. I'm in live with your Eggs Benedict and your rainbow sugar! Why oh why do you do this to me? Why do you have to be hundreds of miles away from me? Why, oh why is it only when I crave you, that I have to drive 4 hours away to see you- to taste you? 

Oh how my heart breaks, how my heart aches for you. 

::end scene::"}
{"text":"Had to take our out of town family to this legendary place,  but the food was only mediocre. I'm  pretty sure the eggs were powdered. The service was also mediocre, but it was super busy as it was Easter morning. This is one of those places you take people just so they get a chance to see it and say they've been there, but it's not really the place to go if youre looking for a high quality breakfast."}
{"text":"the food isnt bad at all.
the reason im reviewing though is for the banana split.

OMG.
definately one of the best i have ever had. and definately worth the $8.95.

if youre around that part of town and just need a quick desert or meal, stay away from the pricey food courts and restaurants in the big casinos.

peppermill is definately worth it."}
{"text":"I loved this place, we will definitely be coming back! The lounge is very comfortable, especially if there's a wait to be seated. Large portions and delicious food!"}
{"text":"-Convenient parking
-The wait to get seated or get food is ridiculous
-At least they have huge screens with videos from around the world to entertain you while you wait
-The food is pretty good
-Coffee is very good as well
-The place is busy and hectic, I do not recommend to seat at the bar, as you might feel like you are a part of the whole hussle."}
{"text":"Bad experience. I was excited to eat at a Peppermill as I used to love the one in Concord, CA. Either things changed or this is not a good restaurant.

I walked in and was seated at the counter (per my request). Although the spot was not cleaned, I assumed it would be soon. The waitress came, after a longer than average wait upon arriving, took my drink order, and left to give me time to decide what I wanted. Five or so minutes later, she returned to take my order. I saw her again once my food was ready and she looked at the spot in front of me with a look like \"where should I put this (as no one came to clean the counter). So I said \"well I guess I'll sit over here since no one is going to clean this\" and sat in the empty space to my right. She looked at me with the 'deer in the headlights' look and said \"oh, uh, sorry\". She set my food down and I didn't see her again until she breezed by to drop off my check. She had time to chit-chat to another patron (an obvious regular) but not to see if I needed anything (like a drink refill). Just as I am ready to leave to pay, she then notices my empty glass and asks if I need a refill.
The food was mediocre but no where near what it used to be, and the fries were barely luke warm.
I paid, left her a low tip but still more than I should have, and left. The spot I originally sat at had never been cleared. My first and last visit here. I can get better service and food from Denny's........and I hate Denny's!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place! Great energy, good drinks. Even on New Years Eve afternoon and it was crowded they made it a good experience."}
{"text":"It was good, but it didn't meet my Yelp great expectations.  It was also not really worth the loooooong walk out there.  I read someone's review saying it was just past the Wynn, but it is WAY past the Wynn, for anyone who's walking.  In fact, it's right before the Riviera, which is pretty far down.

That being said, the food was decent.  Between 3 of us, we ordered the Maserati omelet, waffle combo, and Munch's breakfast (a special).  All were pretty good, but a bit overpriced in my opinion.  Portions were huge.  The service was ok, a bit lackluster.  Our waitress was nice enough though.  I guess I'd come here if I was close but if you're not staying at the Riviera, I wouldn't make an extra trip to come here."}
{"text":"Been here many times, especially after a big night partying in Encore or Wynn . Food has always been spot on. BBQ ribs always a winner."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a Vegas tradition! Complete with rainbow neon and mirrored ceilings. I think everyone should dine here at least once, because it is an experience within itself. I mean, one time, I sat in a booth right next to Jerry Seinfeld and George Wallace. I'm tellin' you - this place is a Vegas landmark.

Their menu is a pretty classic diner menu. Think of a little higher-scaled (but not TOO high) than Denny's, with hamburgers, soup, salad, steak, ice cream for dessert and everything in between. All HUGE portions. Including the drink menu... I recommend trying/gawking at their drink called the \"Scorpion.\" Overall, decent prices for decent food.

Unfortunately, service can vary... It depends on when you decide to stop in. Some nights, I've been seated and served with a smile almost immediately. Other nights, I was left hanging for a while in an otherwise quiet restaurant. Regardless, push past that aspect and enjoy yourself. The Peppermill is open 24/7 and is a great place to end up."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, Big portions, service was great. Friendly staff. Nice environment. Will return."}
{"text":"We decided to pop into The Peppermill for dinner after having cocktails at one of our favorite lounges at The Cosmo. At any rate, I was primed and ready for a hearty, big-portioned meal. The Peppermill apparently has notoriety for that. I'm pleased to say that it didn't disappoint.

We were enticed by the Chicken Nachos as an appetizer. Little did we know that the Chicken Nachos would actually end up as our appetizer AND dinner. The serving size was enormous. Huge! Slathered in a variety of melted cheeses and topped with all the usual suspects, it was amazing. What I loved about it was that all the accouterments were served on the side: a bowl of re-fried beans and more melted cheese, sour cream, salsa and hot sauce. It's nice to be able to have control over the toppings.  Heaven! Bliss! After we were done with the nachos we knew we couldn't even consider ordering a dinner entree. 

I'm a little disappointed because I really was excited about trying Peppermill's Red Pepper Chicken Pasta. It'll have to wait until another trip, sadly. 

We also ordered margaritas. Honestly, they seemed watered down. But we are from San Diego and have very high standards for our margaritas. As such, I'll give them a pass for that. 

The Peppermill appears to have an eclectic demographic, consisting primarily of locals (at least at dinner hour). Our cab driver confirmed that. The douchebags don't typically venture that far down the strip, from what I've learned. 

I would highly recommend this place. If you're a foodie like me, you will leave in a happy food coma. Make reservations in advance to avoid a wait. I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"Four stars is right on with what this place is. 

The only downside is that it is always so busy, but it is always worth the wait. 

The atmosphere is very much a Miami Vice type which I read in another review. 

I think the food is a 4 star, the portions are too big though, but it is always quality I have had nothing but good food and good service here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great breakfast for $10-$20 then you NEED to visit. Always super crowded but it's for a good reason. This place is awesome. The prices are fair and you get LARGE portions. While most places have dwindled down their plate sizes this place has stuck true to filling you up. I'm a big eater and i've never left here without a to-go box."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here. The place has a wonderful and unique atmosphere. The food was very good, had a bit of a mistake with our reservation, but the staff was very friendly and worked quickly to fix the problem."}
{"text":"Hmmmm...I've tried the Fireside Lounge twice now.  I just...don't...get it.  

Why is this place so popular?  

Is it the decor of very faded and cigarette burned booths?  The plastic, fake trees?  The smoke-so-thick-you-can-slice-it air?  The aggravating eye-soar pink lights?

It definitely isn't the drinks.  My friend's Jack and Coke was pretty much just Coke.  My chocolate chip cookie martini wasn't anything special or something that I couldn't find at TGIFridays.

I just don't get the hype about this place.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Great place to cool off during the day. Didn't try the food just got a drink a the the lounge. Wide selection of food and drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here more than a dozen times, I can't remember a trip to Vegas where we didn't go to the Pepper Mill at least once, if not twice.

The decor makes me think of a 1970's airport lounge.Its very retro, fun, and casual.

There is always a wait, if you don't appreciate that, get over yourself and go somewhere else. 

It always seems to be a madhouse and the wait staff is always busy. Be patient. 

I've never felt rushed here, nor have I ever sent my food back for any reason. (but I don't generally do that anyhow.)

The portions are HUGE. (This is my only issue with the place, my sister actually asked them if they could give her a 1/2 portion on a TEN EGG OMELET and she'd pay full price (she just didn't want to waste food) and was told no, they won't cut portions, even if your paying full price.)

I read a bunch of the reviews here before writing mine... Some of the complaints are really unfounded, like \"one dimensional\" Whats that about? Someone else said \"over priced\" Are you serious? Apparently we didn't eat at the same place. The food is very reasonably priced and I can't ever finish what I order.

The only thing I don't like? The Sausage gravy, but that's a personal preference, my guy really likes it.

The spicy bloody mary's are TO DIE FOR! I recommend going and getting one in the fire side lounge, they taste better when the bartender makes them for you rather than the cocktail waitress ordering them for you en mass. The bartender asks what kind of vodka, and how spicy and if we wanted salt, where as the cocktail waitress just asks if you want it spicy or not."}
{"text":"Super cool place. Awesome decor. The Fireside Lounge is amazing! Huge food portions and great  tasting. Definitely a must visit in Vegas. Affordable. Large menu."}
{"text":"Great diner food! This reminds me of a NY diner with its big menu, including breakfast all day, and the huge portions. The veggie omelette reminded me of the local diner in Bayside, Queens - delicious! My son had the burger with onion rings are really loved it. The desserts looked good but we were too full to try them."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here the first night we cane to Vegas, then decided to come here on our last day for breakfast. The food is good. It's diner style food, but I would say definitely better than Denny's. Extremely large portions, so if you'd like to share, it's plenty to go around. 

BIG disappointment when after finishing my food and the last stop of my coffee, i found that the bottom of my coffee cup had a long piece of hair in it. 

It was disgusting, considering i had already finished eating and had a refill of the coffee, but hadn't seen the hair when i drank the first round, since the refill came in before the cup was done. So the hair was sotting at the bottom the whole time.   

I would have given this place 5 stars had it not been for the hair."}
{"text":"I went to Peppermill because my friend and I wanted to go out to eat when it was late, and not much was still open. We also didn't want to spend a lot. I suggested we give this place a try because I drive past it quite a bit and I haven't ever heard anything bad about it. When we arrived, we were seated right away, and our server greeted up quickly. Both of us ordered a burger and fries. The burger was a good size and it was yummy. I also ordered the strawberry shortcake which turned out to be really big, so I shared it with my friend. I would like to go back and try more of their food."}
{"text":"Enjoyable experience..  This is the place to go for a classic old Vegas feel.  The food was great and the portions were enormous... Open 24/7, so ya can't go wrong"}
{"text":"This place is our go to before we hit the road from Vegas to LA - you're not gonna find a hearty breakfast like that in the bougie hotels ;)"}
{"text":"This place makes some really good food. If you're looking for a place to get your grub on after cuttin up a rug at the clubs, this is the place to be. Try the philly cheese steak or better yet, go for the chorizo and eggs breakfast platter. That was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is a Vegas cultural icon! Has been open since the 70s and I hope it doesn't change !!I have to say that the quality of the food certainly hasn't changed I have the French toast collage which consists of eggs sausage on four pieces of French toast and the serving for enough for two people it was delicious the French toast was golden and crispy on the outside the scrambled eggs were so fluffy and the sausage is the biggest I've ever seen! No matter what time of day I go the place is always packed!! You must come here instead of the basic casino cafe."}
{"text":"No matter what I have eaten at the Peppermill, it is always delicious. The portion sizes are enormous. Great food in a good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chorizo breakfast meal. Food is good but service sucks here. The waitress didn't ask if anyone needed refill of coffee or water and when we have to ask for it, it takes awhile for it to come. I'm giving it two stars because the food is good but the service is poor that I won't come back. I can't enjoy good food with bad/poor service. Price is reasonable and portions is huge. The waiting wasn't long. It took less than ten minutes to sit nine of us."}
{"text":"The worst diner I have ever been in. Very dirty and chaotic. We sat at the counter and had the pleasure (sarcasm intended) of watching the dirty condiments counter for half an hour without any food and lost our appetite eventually. If you knew how many fingers picked up dropped food off the floor (they toss it bur still, no hand washing whatsoever) then dipped into the huge butter tub you would think twice before eating that toast."}
{"text":"This place is good but not amazing. The portions are huge and I recommend sharing a dish. The food is good but not not a five star. I would go back because it is iconic vegas. No wait and was seated right away so that was a big plus. Overall good solid place for food."}
{"text":"Interesting place on the strip! I was surprised at how clean it was! We went for Sunday morning breakfast and really enjoyed it! The eggs are nice and fluffy and the homefries are awesome! Juicy blueberry muffin, unlike no other in Vegas! Must try if you live in town or just visiting!"}
{"text":"great great brunch/diner

what i had:
- country fried steak + eggs w/biscuit + gravy: uhm... pretty perfect. i loved the crunch of the steak. hashed browns were perfect - hot and fluffy with plenty of crunch! eggs were... you know, eggs. nothing amazing, but nothing to complain about. biscuit was fluffy, flaky and light! amazing smothered with the country gravy
- bloody mary: they do it right! spicy, flavorful, i had this at the fireside lounge before we got our table and nearly drank the entire thing. its like a freaking meal in a cup!

for two breakfast entres and two coffees it came out to about $45 (doesnt include the bloody mary) with tip... so, not as cheap as dennys, but i think it was worth every penny.

pros:
- food! well... i cant really speak for anything other than what i ate and drank... but it looks like they do breakfast foods great. the menu looked extensive! i had to limit how much i could look at because if i looked at anything i wouldnt be able to order
- service: pretty good. jennifer was cheerful and had a great attitude. she wasnt always the most attentive, but i went in at the end of father's day brunch, so everyone looked swamped. but despite being busy, she always remained positive and happy
- location: right on the strip towards the north end, its a great 24 hour place that serves great food

cons:
- decor: ... honestly, i went back and forth because i wasnt sure if this was a pro or con for this place. yes its damn cheesy and outdated and wacky. i cant imagine a time when the decor or the servers' outfits would have been fashionable... but, it kind of works with the feel of it. the fireside lounge is pretty cheesy too. it seems straight out of the seventies but... it makes this place memorable! id prefer the blatant outmoded fashion and decor then a place that just tries too hard to look modern and ends up looking commercial (think the wynn decor... yuck!)
- part of the decor i guess, but this place was freaking dark. maybe just part of the ambiance, but weird to eat your breakfast in such a dark place

anyways, despite the cheesy outdated decor (think dennys + disco + lots of dark purple stuff), would i go back again? YES! why? the food was amazing. i love breakfast places. so instead of spending big bucks at a brunch buffet, why not just get it right at the peppermill?"}
{"text":"7/5/13 Breakfast

3.5*  Unless you eat at McDonalds or a food court, there is no cheap meal in Vegas anymore, at least not on the strip. Prices for breakfast can be steep in the hotel restaurants. Peppermill is an economical option because they give you big portion, like food-coma-big-portion. And it's open 24/7.

It's a diner alright, but with tacky decor. Think purple neon lights and trees inside. Waitresses clad in Hawaiian-theme uniforms. This is the big-eater haven, the greasy-spoon diner where you go to soak up the alcohol. That said, I only come here for breakfast.

*Fruit Plate with Banana Nut Bread ($13.25): This is literally a basket full of fresh fruit--cantalope wedges, honey dew wedges, pineapples, grapes, strawberries and kiwis. You get a mini loaf of warm banana bread!  Skip the marshmellow sauce if its too heavy.

*Tostada Omelet ($13.50): It certainly tastes better than it looks. It's a big plate of messy omelet with black olives, zesty beef and diced tomatoes. Looks like nacho. It comes with hash brown AND tortilla chips.

*Sausage and Three Eggs ($11.95): Probably the smallest plate in the house and you can substitute Canadian bacon or ham. My scrambled eggs were okay-fluffy and the sausages are of the low-grade. Very greasy and fatty. Instead of toast I requested a blueberry muffin for a taste. It was steamy hot but chewy. Not very good.

*Extraordinary Oatmeal ($9.50): Sprinkled with raisins, walnuts, and banana galore. Healthy option. 

It's so much food that most people pack it up and take it to-go. If you want to challenge yourself, get the French Toast Collage with four wedges of French toasts, two eggs, two strips of bacon and hash brown. Eat yourself to a coma. Quantity certainly supersedes quality here. It's not bad but nothing mind-blowing. Service is quick and friendly. It's a no-frill place on the strip north of Wynn between Encore and Riviera. Crowd range from divey to genteel retired. Get here early or be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes after 10."}
{"text":"I do love the PepperMill! I have to say on the last outing here the portion size of the salads has diminished quite a bit. My husband and I usually split a salad they are so big, but not this time.

I love this place, it is like an 80's throwback, lot's of glitz and glamour, and all the PerrpeMills I have ever been to are exactly the same. ((Bay Area included)). 

The fireside lounge is pretty cozy as well (same as it ever was) a bit of an icon, nothing like a froo froo drink and some appetizers in front of a fire (in Vegas the fire place is not really a requirement) but it makes you think it might be really cold outside (which in Vegas is rare).

If you are visiting Vegas, this is a restaurant you should visit, I mean it is on the strip, and the food is good, lot's on the menu, the people watching is fantastic (I love to people watch). Interesting folks here and the pricing is reasonable ((I did mention it is on the strip right?))"}
{"text":"The wait was long, but the food was well worth it!  I shared the crab cake Benedict with my friend and so glad I did because the portion was HUGE.  Will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice decor, but I had a traumatic experience at breakfast -- avoid the corned beef hash at all costs.  Seemed like dog food straight out of the can."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  The only reason it doesn't get four stars  because the wait is really long. I also wasn't big on the service it took ten minutes for someone to acknowledge our group of four people. The arrival time was around 5pm.  Once seated I had already Google what I wanted so I ordered the Fish and Chips and a also had the recommended $16 drink.  My friend order breakfast, and the other order a bacon burger with onion rings.  Everyone was extremely pleased with the food. Another great thing was we arrived straight from the airport and the held my luggage for us behind the counter. I suggest you call before to verify the wait time."}
{"text":"WELL KISS MY GRITS!

I have lived in Las Vegas for just over ten years now. Finally I have made it to the Peppermill. Service was a little disappointing, but not so bad to kill this review. My wife and I went on a Friday close to 11:20am. We were told it would be about 20-25 minutes until a table was ready; we were invited to wait inside the Fireside Lounge.

My wife and I don't drink but LOVED the atmosphere in the Fireside Lounge. We literally sat fireside, watching the atmosphere, looking over the menu, this is where I discovered that Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis had dined at The Peppermill. Personally I think that's cool. As if it were on cue, our table was ready in 20-25 minutes.

As we sat, at our booth, Hope you like booth seating. Unless you are at bar we will be seated in a booth! Our server arrived soon after. We were overlooking the menu still as the waitress took our drink orders. When she returned we still needed time to decide. Our waitress said \"I'll be back\" as if our not ordering yet was an inconvenience for her. 

The food was fine. Typical diner like fare. We had mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. I ate a  Philly Cheese Steak, Savory u.s.d.a. choice beef strips flash - sautéed with strips of onion, bell peppers, sliced tomato and smothered with provolone on a grilled steak roll. My wife ate what was called, Conquest, Combination of roast beef, cheddar cheese, tomato, sautéed peppers, onions, mushrooms, thousand island dressing and bacon, served on grilled parmesan sourdough. The meal reminded me a lot of eating at a diner like Denny's. When I mentioned this to my wife she fully agreed. 

As we were eating, a lady with camera walked by and asked if we would like to pose for a souvenir picture. We agreed.The lady with camera said she would return as soon as we were done with out meals. But alas she never returned.
The meal was all but over. My plate was empty; my wife still had a few onion rings on her plate. Our waitress came by and asked how we enjoyed our meals. As we were answering, she took the plates, without asking if my wife wanted those remaining onion rings.

WELL KISS MY GRITS!

As we were leaving we walked right by that lady with a camera, who never returned to take out picture."}
{"text":"Great place for traditional greasy breakfast. Large portion as well."}
{"text":"Great food and service, reasonable prices, neat enviornment"}
{"text":"This is an awesome after hours spot for drunk munchies. They have a big menu with many items to choose from and all day breakfast. The staff is so cute and helpful. We even got a free souvenir photo! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"we ordered the sampler; chichen strips, onion rings, mozzerella sticks, fried shrimp, and bruschetta. all were awsome...didn't care for the bruschetta.  nachos.. huge n verry verry good!!  these appetizers were enough for 6 ppl.
drinks- spicy bloody mary, tequila sunrise and blue hawaian... best drinks in las vegas. 
the atmosphere is old school vegas. i only regret that we went here on the last day. i would've retured for drinks n appetizers."}
{"text":"Boy, did the Peppermill hit the spot! First off, walking in is as big and wonderful a trip as anyone who appreciates neon would describe it. It's kitschy Vegas at its best. The seating is arranged in these amorphous islands of booths, which makes us feel like we're all neon jellyfish in the middle of the ocean deep, and it's enchanting. 

The diner food is also as good as it gets. The three of us discovered that we are all \"breakfast for dinner\" people, and we freaking chowed down, sharing parts of our ginormous meals with each other but still managing to clean most of our plates.

French Toast Collage - So good, and I'm so glad I got to share a couple of my squares so I didn't have to eat them all myself. Eggs, bacon, sausage, all perfect.

Steak and Eggs - Very good, quality steak, sunny side up eggs, and I tried the wonderful toast and real strawberry jam also. 

Veggie Omelet - Well received. 

Definitely returning to the Peppermill!"}
{"text":"The pepper mill is a decent enough restaurant which reminds me of 13 coins (up in Seattle).  That is they serve any food all the time.  I went to the Pepper mill for breakfast and had a bacon and onion omelet.  It was huge and pretty good.  Based on my experience the put an emphasis on size.  And if you are really hungry this might be good."}
{"text":"I heard great things about the Peppermill for years and finally made the effort to check it out. The food was delicious! Portions are large enough for you to share with your bestie. After dinner we went into the lounge and had cocktails. A cozy little spot to have a couple drinks and honey roasted peanuts before heading out to the club."}
{"text":"The decor is pretty fabulous - flashback to the late 80s with lots of teal, mauve and mirrors. Pina colada was delicious. Unfortunately the French dip sandwich did not impress - dry, even with the dip, and overcooked. Worse, the waitress completely ignored our table. While the lounge may have great service, the experience in the restaurant left a bad taste."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars because they have the balls to hang on to the outrageous interior with the neon lights and the mirrors and the purple/pink/blue/black color scheme. Also because they serve a delicious 16 ounce bone-in ham steak. They throw it on the grill to give it some char and it kills anything you'd get at IHOP or Denny's. 

I guarantee you won't see waitresses in Von Trapp family costumes and cocktail servers in black prom dresses back home, noble tourist. You won't be able to wait for your breakfast table while drinking a tequila sunrise and seated in a smoky lounge on a red velour sofa in front of a small lake of fire, either. You can even cure a hangover here.

If you want a taste of \"old Vegas\" at breakfast, just go."}
{"text":"Came here with my girl back in April 2014.  This was the closest place to eat at. And at 2a.m you really don't care where you go, especially when your starving! So we gave it a shot. First off, it's a funky colorful disco diner. Makes you feel like your stepping back into the 70s. The service was cool. The food was nothing special. Your typical diner food. It seems to be busy, which speaks a lot in itself. Overall, It was a nice experience."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!! The food is outstanding!! The carrot cake blew my mind!! Super friendly staff!! If you want to complain about the price, you may want to figure in how much food you get. The portions are huge!!"}
{"text":"This place had pretty good reviews so I decided to take my mom and family there for my mom's birthday brunch. I ordered eggs Benedict. It was supposed to come with three sandwich things or whatever you call them and I only got 2 with an extra yolk on top. I asked to substitute hash browns with a bagel because I don't eat potatoes and she said no and said I could get a side bagel and she charged me $5 for it. Although expensive the only thing I actually enjoyed for the whole meal was the bagel. My parents didn't enjoy their food (Joe's SF breakfast and Country fried steak) and my brother said his was okay (turkey burger). Our waitress (Angelica or Angelina or something like that) was rude and never smiled but smiled at the guys at the bar while flirting. My mom told the manager and she said oh I'm sorry about that and didn't even discount anything of the $80 bill. We've eaten better at a buffet dinner for only $65! Overall it was the worst meal I've had here in Vegas and although the restaurant itself was pretty, I'll never go there again. Don't waste your money here when there's so many better places."}
{"text":"Unless you are stating on the north end of the strip, The Peppermill is quite a trek to access. It was super busy on Friday morning in October. It took about a half hour for two of us to be seated. They recommended that we wait in the fireside room. We didn't take them up on that but it must be huge because people kept piling in there. You feel like you are in a bit of a time warp here. Waitresses in panty hose and plastic plants abound. 

Once we were seated, the service was great. We decided to split the Lorraine omelette and a Belgian waffle. The omelette was light and fluffy. It featured the perfect amount of bacon. The waffle was solid. I ordered a mimosa for the Mr. It was quite large and carried the price tag to match its size.

My biggest complaint was trying to pay the bill to leave. They have one old fashioned register for the entire restaurant. I had to stand in a line, along the diner stool area and had to constantly move to get out of people's way. It took over 15 minutes to pay our bill."}
{"text":"Typical Vegas Neon style dark restaurant. We went for breakfast and the oatmeal and the French toast were both good. Coffee was watered down. Waiter was a dick. Wouldn't go back even though the food was good."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!  What an experience!?!?  There's not many places in the US serving Arabian steaks!  The shrimp scampi had the most unique flavor, I still can't put my finger on it, or put it in my mouth.  All 4 of our waitstaff and the 2 drink ladies for the alcoholic beverages, did their best to keep us glued to our seats for an extended stay.  The ambiance of the place was something right out of a Japanese teenagers dream of an American high school prom.  I really enjoyed the nachos, and the fact the toppings came out halfway through us eating them, well that was the special touch only found in truly unique eateries. To cap off the meal we finally got the garlic bread, which was for our salads, just in time for desert."}
{"text":"Hungry?  Hungover?  HANGRY?  Get your ass over to The Peppermill than!  Big portions of good eats!  I had the eggs benedict and murdered it.  Granted, I had the appetite of a Sasquatch from a prior Vegas night but this breakfast (at noon) hit the spot.  I can only attest for my one plate of food, but from that and the service solid 4 stars... great diner.

Tip: Make a reservation!  Place was SLAMMED when I showed up.  People were waiting outside."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the scrambled eggs. Buttery and fresh. 
5 Stars for the fire water pit in the bar. Good tunes! 
5 Stars for wait and service staff in their costumes
5 Stars for not revamping into faux trendy
5 Stars for the Bloody Mary's 

Psssssst! Really good coffee would put this place over the top
Don't try to get in on weekend mornings 9-12 go early or go late."}
{"text":"Oh man there was so much food! And mirrors! and indoor trees!

Great place for a little hair of the dog. Tasty bloody mary, as many have pointed out.

And the decor is awesome.

Short wait for 5 at 11am, prime time when everyone was waking up from the night before. 

HUGE portions. I ordered french toast and a side of bacon, and it was a TON of texas toast. Lots of syrup. Everything was satisfying.

Slay your hangover here!"}
{"text":"This place is great. It is so much fun and so Vegas. Get a fishbowl drink, yum!
Very good food and our breakfast was delicious."}
{"text":"Fun retro diner serves classic American dishes. Have been here many times with family & friends ' everyone loves this place ! Great desserts too - try the Elegant Brownie it's so good!"}
{"text":"I went to the Peppermill for my 21st bday, and got my first drink there.

I purposefully went looking for somewhere to go for my 21st, and I loved all the photos of the outside and inside of the Peppermill. When I got there, I was not disappointed by its looks. Sure, some may think its too \"vegas-y\" or tacky but I really enjoyed the uniqueness.

As for the food, the portions are large but finish-able, I had a pancake breakfast for dinner and my boyfriend had the fish and chips (curly fries) and we were both happy. I tried a mai tai and it was pretty big and delicious, though I can't compare it to other mai tai's as it was my first drink.

The staff were very helpful, and we even got a free souvenir photo! 

If you're going to Vegas, I'd definitely stop by at least once (or twice). Also, LARGE parking lot!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, definitely not the best, but it's open 24 hours and the portions are huge.  The menu was similar (on a smaller scale) to a Cheesecake Factory menu where you can get a little of everything.  They also serve alcohol, although their drinks are weak and equivalent to the watered down free ones you get in the casinos. I had the Cobb Salad which was nicely prepared."}
{"text":"This is a nice classic place to meet people. I love the cocktails here and the ambience it is a good place to meet chicks"}
{"text":"A must try when in Vegas.
Also a wait but worth it.
Great place for breakfast with a cocktail any time of the day.
Been coming here since the 90's the has never changed but unfortunately more and more people have found out abt this place and is always a full house."}
{"text":"I thought this place was ehhh.. I only tried the teriyaki wings and they were actually pretty good but nothing special! They came in such a huge portion that I had leftovers for later. I didn't try anything else but I don't think I'd stop by again just because I think I can find a better place."}
{"text":"James is the best!! 

We love the Peppermill and it's staff! 

You will love the ambience, casual to dressy environment, you choose they welcome all. 

Plates are generous, food is wonderful, service outstanding!

The BAR is amazing!! Fully stocked and fresh ingredients! Drinks are made to order and custom, hand poured and not from a pitcher or boxed cardboard container! 

Peppermill is a must do while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"From the pictures, I expected this up scale modern restaurant. 

Nope. It's a diner (at least in the afternoon). 

Googlemaps failed me and my friends and I wandered a bit after we got off the express Deuce. If you're taking the same form of transportation, be on the lookout. It's located as it's own separate building as a restaurant and is not located in a casino. 

The food was good. Definitely recommend the salads! PORTIONS ARE HUGEEE! Had more avocado than we knew what to do with and I LOVE AVOCADO! Large bushel of grapes were also a highlight. Four stars for the salads, minus a star for the lack luster service.

They're also hawking photos here, which kind of sleazed up our experience, but hey, we got a free photo to go with the memories!"}
{"text":"I love the Peppermill. It's one of my favorite places to go when I visit Vegas. If I lived in Vegas I would visit this place a few times a month. I love the design of the place, the lighting, the drinks, the food, the service. It's an old school Vegas hangout. I hope it never closes. Check out happy hour I think it's M-F starting st 9pm"}
{"text":"I came here on my sister's recommendation and I was not disappointed. The prices were a bit steep but that's to be expected on the strip. The burger was good, but beware because the portions are pretty big!!
They have small booths (good for about 4 people). The wait was a little long but the waitress was super nice! I want to try some of their breakfast foods since their burger was pretty good."}
{"text":"Yep breakfast here like everyone else..good portions good service. .And a bit of a wait but worth it"}
{"text":"Pretty serious portions!!!
The omlettes are huge, and come with a muffin too!!
Service is generally fast and sweet. 
There is often a wait in the morning to early afternoon . . . It moves fast but can some times be in excess of 30 mins. 
So come hungry. . . .And patient if possible. 
But overall, good quality food and very reasonable prices. 
Close to Riviera and Circus casinos."}
{"text":"Go around 8am for some seriously fantastic Vegas people-watching. None of whom, naturally, have even been to bed yet or are even remotely sober.

The prices are a little steep (it's Vegas), but the portions are worth it and it's all quite yummy. Very solid biscuits & gravy (and it's a giant serving). The mimosas are also not only quite large, they're not mostly OJ!

Seems to be a very popular Vegas staple and with good reason. I'd say it's a must-do for breakfast."}
{"text":"I love this place, food is consistently good every time I go. Definitely old school Las Vegas, and thats a good thing in my opinion. i take friends there or recommend Peppermill for friend's who come to Las Vegas. Some tables are a bit close, but i have had some enjoyable interaction with complete strangers, so what started out to be what I thought would be uncomfortable turned out to be good experiences. Will go back as often as I can."}
{"text":"This place is so tacky, it's not even funny.  Upon entering, you feel like the SS Enterprise teleported you back to 1980.  I want to brae out my shoulder pads, aqua net, parachute pants and Members Only jacket.  The ceilings are mirrored, with neon pink, and blue lights everywhere.  There are these giant fake cherry blossom trees, and planter after planter of fake plants and flowers.  Just think, the cheesiest place imaginable. 

You may come here to be entertained by the cheesy atmosphere, but you definitely come here for the amazing food.  The portions are enormous! Definitely big enough for two to split.  We got one garden omelette, a fruit cup, and an order of eggs Benedict to share for three people.  It was more than enough food.  

While the food and the service were both excellent, the only bummer of this visit was the 30 plus minute ticket time to get our food.  The server repeatedly apologized, and was kind enough to not charge us for our coffee, iced tea and oj.  This is the minus one star.  Otherwise this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint. Shared an omelet with a side of hash browns, a bagel and cream cheese and coffee for two all for under @20. The omelet is massive, almost could not finish with two of us indulging.

Sat at the bar as the tables were full. The place was popping on a Thursday morning, right before NYE. Chose this place cause it was just across from the tix 4 tonight booth. Service was a bit slow, but we didn't care. Waitress was amusing."}
{"text":"24/7 diner with lots of Neon. Food is good for being 24/7. Nothing amazing, but the Chicken Caesar salad is great! Huge portions, strongly recommend to share. The desserts are a MUST have! Leave room to try the brownie or strawberry shortcake - a real Vegas experience."}
{"text":"This place was a food refuge after being trapped with Kady's at the Riv.  The food was always great, from the massive breakfast portions, to the decent steak offerings.  The drinks were always decent, with a good pour of liquor, not the light handed stuff you get at the hotel bars.  Service was always prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"FOOD: It's good. But too much serving in every meal. Coffee is too strong. (Not a fan of leftover breakfast.)
SERVICE: It was okay. You have to get their attention if you want water, boxes, check and etc. (Just maybe bec it's a busy area.)
AMBIANCE: Unique for a breakfast. Neon lights at early morning. Servers dressed well. Traditional club design. 
LOCATION: at the strip. parking available for free. 
VALUE OF MONEY: It's okay. I feel like I overpaid bec of the leftover. They could have make a lesser serving with lesser amount."}
{"text":"Had breakfast today with some friends.  We sat in Crystal's section.  She's a great server....she was very attentive and ensures that you're well taken care of.  It was a business breakfast, so she allowed us private time to handle business and when we were ready for food, she came by to take our order.

I ordered the Belgian Waffles this morning.  The waffle was very good....not under/over cooked like I experience at some restaurants.

My favorite part about this place is that it's a throwback....not only in decor, but in service.  Everyone there is friendly and works hard to ensure your meal goes well.

Will I return?  You bet!"}
{"text":"Great little brunch spot, they do serve breakfast lunch and dinner 24/7 though. Located right on the strip. The pancakes are huge!! And the service was great. Kinda looks like an old 70s set. Very vintage. Moderately priced local spot."}
{"text":"We came here during the week for dinner.  We were seated pretty quickly.  This restaurant seemed like a cross between Denny's and a mom and pop diner.  We were served pretty quickly.  I ordered a salad and it was a gigantic serving.  I like the bright neon pink lights.  They make the place look cool."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. My boyfriend and I had a very quick night in Vegas. The night before we went to the High Roller which everyone should do and had dinner from a taco truck. So around 3am (we are from the east coast so my sleep schedule was all screwed up) I woke up hungry. So around 330 I had woken him and convinced him we should go to breakfast since we had an early flight out that day. 

We were staying at the SLS and asked an employee downstairs of some breakfast options. The hotel had a breakfast but the guy said Peppermill was great so we called an Uber. It was maybe less than a mile away so we ended up walking back. 

Once we got there, we felt sort of old because apparently everyone is just awake at 4am in Vegas - like from the night before. And we are showing up sleepy since we just woke up. Anyway, the place was packed but somehow we got seated very quickly. 

Our waitress was over right away and showed us the drink specials which I could take advantage of but bf couldn't since he had to work that day. So I decided to rub it in and ordered the scorpion which is huge. I think she said six shots are in it. I can't remember for sure because I had six shots of liquor. Whatever it was, it was tasty and gigantic. 

Our food even came out quickly which we didn't expect given how crowded they were. I have no idea what I ordered - I can't find it on the menu but there is a pic and it involved eggs and peppers and chips. It was fantastic and I don't usually love breakfast at 4am. Bf had the chorizo and eggs and ate all of it. 

We ended up walking back to the hotel which made us feel sort of better about ourselves given the amount of food we just ate. Anytime he's working here again I want to come back and try some of their regular menu. It's a great place. Food is good and service is wonderful even though they seem completely busy even at 4am."}
{"text":"Great food and massive portions at reasonable prices. Without a doubt the best breakfast in Vegas!!  From the moment we found this place we have went out of our way to eat here every vegas trip since. Yes be prepared for a wait on the weekends but it will have been well worth it. 
Woohoo! As good as it gets! Indeed."}
{"text":"Our Vegas trip was in April 2017. Our first night in Vegas ended here at the Peppermill at about 1am. We were staying at the Circus Circus, so this is almost right across the street. 
We were seated right away and handed some pretty big menus. We hadn't really eaten throughout the day so we were pretty hungry. Thank the food Gods for that. The portions are HUGE. 
I had settled on the omelette with Feta, Spinach and Artichokes. Holy Cow, there is easily a dozen eggs there. It was so good though. I ate more than I should have. There was no way I could gamble anymore. I had to go to bed and I slept like a well fed baby. This might be my worst review because I was tired and I can barely remember what was happening around me. I have no idea what anyone else ordered. Other than my sisters were raving about a Blueberry muffin and laughing at my amusement with the sugar dispenser. No, I wasn't drinking... just exhausted. I will say it was pricey, but they make up for it by the extra large portion. The service is on point as well."}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself in Vegas, you must make sure to stop at the landmark that is the Peppermill Inn Restaurant. 
I had heard about the Peppermill from my brother in law who insisted multiple times that I make a stop there during my stay in Sin City. When I went this last January, I finally made the time to get over there for a 3:00pm breakfast. If I knew what I know now about the Peppermill, I'd beat my own ass for not going sooner.
The lettering on the outside said a lot when I see \"PEPPERMILL\" spelled out in a rainbow of neon lights.  My friend Kristina and I skipped in excitement through the doors and entered in jaw-dropping bewilderment. Chills ran down our spines as we were slapped in the face with what I can only describe as pure neon splendor. A resounding WOW was all we could say until the hostess made us snap out of it and asked how many in out party. I couldn't help but ask her, \"Do you get a headache working here?\" She giggled and said,\" When I first started, I thought there was no way I could work here for long, but you get use to it.\" 
As she led us through the forest of silk trees and flowers to our table, we admired her classicly tacky floral uniform and shimmery tights. I've never been more jealous of a working environment. The menu was large and filled with a huge assortment of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.. always being served.
I called my brother in law for \"must-haves\" and was told to get the Bloody Mary, among other specialties. I went ahead and ordered my Tower of Bloody Mary and it was amazing. I'm a sucker for biscuits and gravy, so we ordered that.. along with the Fantasia waffle. A belgian waffle covered in fresh fruit, blueberry syrup and choice of whipped cream or sour cream. We ate until we thought we would explode, but the fun didn't end there.
Rumors of the breathtaking \"Fireside Lounge\" and it's famous fire pit drew us to it's glory. If I thought the neon goodness was only in the restaurant, I was extremely mistaken. Take all the yummy neon lights, then dim the rest of the lights, add some pink couches and cocktail waitresses in gowns and full make-up (no matter the time of day).. you have yourself the Fireside Lounge. Oh wait! It gets better... The FIRE PIT!! I've never seen anything so amazing. Imagine a tiny jacuzzi with fire coming out of it and the vent lined with little TV's showing the hottest sporting event. Nothing short of fantastic. We sunk into a spot around the fire and it took Superman's will power to get us up and out of there. 
Do yourself a favor. Go to the Peppermill. If not for the decor, do it for the food. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Large portions, great food and alcohol beverages! Glad the Uber driver recommended this place for breakfast over Denny's. After experiencing the food, we ate here every morning we were in Vegas and this is now our go-to spot after a night out in Vegas. Although, I think the service is hit or miss because the couple next to us was ignored after being seated and finally left after a few minutes of not being noticed. So far, nothing negative for us here."}
{"text":"Me and my friend were staying at the Riviera hotel which is very close to the Peppermill Restaurant.  We got in around 1:00am and were starving for food.  We ordered long islands which were so good! We both ordered a meal with omelets and they were amazing! You get plenty of food and the wait staff was very nice.

There is a lounge inside and we did check out after a night out at Tao.  If your close def stop by this place!"}
{"text":"The peppermill is where the locals go. We sat at the bar because we were starving and didn't want to wait to be seated. There is always a wait, but they seem to get the food out fast to turn the tables quickly.

I've never been inside a restaurant like this before.. It is like a diner mixed with a theme restaurant. I couldn't believe all the pink trees inside. Definitely fun and quirky.. Totally Vegas. The food portions are so huge. We shared an omelet and I was certian we wouldn't finish it all. But we powered through and I'm glad we did because it was very good. 

Not far from the strip and very reasonable prices, I would come again."}
{"text":"I came here with a few co-workers for my going away dinner. I've always driven by the Peppermill when I'm on this side of the Strip, but I've never actually stepped inside it. Upon entering, I was a bit surprised. From the outside it doesn't really look like much but once you step in, it's like entering a different world. 

The inside was really cool because everything was bright and colorful, yet still had a dimly-lit feeling. The bright neon lights and the light above our table didn't make it seem as dark as it felt. I really dig the ambience to this place. 

I ordered the pork loin and eggs. The dish consisted of 4 pan-fried pork cutlets, hash browns, your choice of toast, and 3 eggs of any style (I went with poached eggs). The pork loin was soft and tender. I'm sometimes hesitant to order pork dishes (especially pan-fried pork loin) because they run the risk of being hard, dry, and unappealing. The way the chefs cooked the pork here made the pieces easy to cut, and retain most of the natural juices and flavor. Bravo!

The hash brown shreds are bigger in size than most places that serve similar diner food. The poached eggs were alright, and is best eaten with the sourdough toast.

This is probably one of the places you should visit if you're ever on the north end of the Strip. Come for the unique ambience, but definitely stay for the great tasting food!"}
{"text":"It's always great service here, not one time that I've been here and had a decent service, always excellent. The food is good, drinks look great. It's a great place to socialize with friends, have good food and great atmosphere. Adam lambert just shot a music video here about 2 weeks ago so that's a cool reason itself to try it out"}
{"text":"The Steak house at Circus Circus was closed and we wanted to know of a place we could still get a good steak at 11 p.m. The maitre d' recommended we try Peppermill.  The restaurant was crowded but there wasn't a wait to get a table. Ordering drinks took forever because the waitress had to get a separate \"cocktail waitress\" to take our alcoholic drink order. One of our friends joked she wouldn't order a steak based on what she saw walking to our table. The price for a steak dinner ranged from $26 to $29. I commented back to her for that price how could the steaks be bad. Boy was I wrong. I order a New York steak and shrimp dinner for $29. The steak was the size you would get for a $9.99 steak and eggs breakfast. To say this was over priced is an understatement. I know size isn't everything but this steak didn't even taste good. The other dinners (chicken nachos and a fresh fruit platter)  were no better.  If that wasn't bad enough our cocktails were of the premixed straight from the fountain gun dispenser type. Needless to say no one finished their food or drinks. What a waste of money. As for the maitre d' I wonder if he gets some sort of kick back for sending people to this place. So much for asking a local where to eat."}
{"text":"This place is interesting. Huge portions and the whole vibe is old Vegas feeling but in a great way. My omelet contained 10 eggs. It was very filling and loaded with cheese and fillings. It came with a side of fried potatoes and bread. I selected the blueberry muffin. We also had some of the best bottomless coffee on the strip. It would be a place I would definitely recommend and come back to. Wonderful authentic Las Vegas diner."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Vegas and my first stop other than the airport. I found this place by accident and I was really happy I did. If you are hungry for some great food this is your place. You better bring your appetite because the portions are huge!! The service was great from start to finish and I will be sure to visit again before I leave!"}
{"text":"A neon landmark in Las Vegas!

I must have driven past this place a 100 times...and not known how special it is!

I only noticed it because Mel C. checked in at Peppermill recently.  I read his review, then I saw Terri's and Sheila's, and many other friends' reviews...so, this established restaurant rose to the top of my list of places to go to in Las Vegas!.

The neon sign is a landmark. 
The free parking is a blessing. 
The interior is unique. There's a pink and purple magical glow that welcomes everyone!

On one side, the lounge features a fire pit!  The other side is a cool dining area with pink flamingos decorating the lamps!

Mel, Terri, Sheila, Dear Daniel, Minky, and I sat together in a cozy booth.  The menu has such variety that everyone got a chance to order something they liked.

Mel's omelette consisted of ten (10) eggs!!!  Yes!  TEN!  OMG!  That's why there's a ketchup happy smile on his plate!  Whoa!

I got the Grilled salmon which came with a side Caesar Salad. Yummy!  The cooked veggies were a bit well done, but I appreciated the healthy boost! 

Friends always make my meals taste good!  I thank you for joining me at dinner and look forward to our next foodie adventure!

Note: next time, I will make sure I get something that uses the special colorful sugar that they are known for!"}
{"text":"I know there is another review for this place, but i'm pretty sure this is the correct name for tthe lounge/restaurant. went here couple weeks ago when me and the guys went to vegas for a 21st bday bash. it was 2am and my friends and i were pooped and wanted a place where we can go and chill. i remembered watching the vegas episode of \"no reservations\" with anthony bourdain a while back. they came to peppermill for some cocktail in a huge bowl. i knew i wanted one. 

before entering the lounge you must remember the dress code: no hats. other than that your good to go. it was dark but the neon lights and black lights brought a relaxing mood to this place. it was me and 3 other guys. bad idea. this place is for COUPLES! if your not there with a significant other, you'll feel a little awkward. the plush couches were made for snuggling. we felt really uncomfortable and so we headed straight to the bar. i saw those huge goblets and i told the waitress i wanted whatever drink goes inside those. the cocktail was the scorpion. i had it before at trader vic's. its a very good fruity/girly cocktail. i really couldn't taste/feel the alcohol....yet. its 18 dollars for the cocktail but it can easily be shared by 3-4 people. some guy next to us won 7000 dollar jackpot in video poker, and i'm not too sure the management was too happy with that. overall, this place is a really chill, relaxed place to hang out after a long hard night of gambling, drinking, clubbing/dancing. but make sure you come with a significant other or else get ready to feel lonely and awkward. 






SECRET....order the scorpion blended with ice cream. it will freakin rock your world. o and be careful please cuz you won't be tasting any alcohol in it.....it'll taste like a fruit milkshake. :)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Vegas if you ask me.  Really great food without the absurd vegas pricing.  Yeah its more expensive than shitty dennys but its 10x as good.  The staff is good and decent to look at too.  Egg Benedict FTW."}
{"text":"Great hangover breakfast spot. Portions were large, price was fair. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"the drinks and breakfast portions are enormous! Service was fantastic and the ambiance is classic 80's ...awesome!"}
{"text":"Went here because everyone said it was the place to go.  Well we went for lunch, the food was ok. The environment was early 70's theme.  Nothing wrong with that, if that's what one is looking for.  Well, it seems it is the place to be for the lounge, not the restaurant part.  We did not go back to see what the lounge had to offer.  But if you are only going for the food, that's not what the rave is all about.  The staff was very nice and everything looked cleaned to me.  Next time we will go for the lounge experience , get drunk then tell you how it went."}
{"text":"They have such a huge food selection and breakfast is served 24/7! The portions are gigantic.friendly staff and really cool ambiance with all the neon lights. We have come here for breakfasts, brunches, lunches, dinners and even late nights after going out. Consistently good food. My favorite place to come when we visit Vegas. Plan ahead though because sometimes the wait is very long."}
{"text":"Forget what you heard. Yes, the decor is horrendous. Yes, the servers are dressed in severely dated threads. And yes, the wait can be long and cramped. It's all worth it once you sink your teeth into one of the best hang over meals in Vegas.

I had the tostada omelette and a huge mimosa. I also got to taste the chicken fried steak. Everything was delicious.

The service is friendly and efficient. 

Just go!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, good service (in skimpy outfits), and the basics (eggs and hash browns) are decidedly better than Denny's. Certainly gaudy, but isn't that the point?

Unlike other reviewers, we didn't experience excessive endearments from our server, though she was from the South."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you are only \"a little hungry\". They make 7 egg omelets folks. The fruit salads are worthy enough to fit on Carmen Meranda's hat. The sugar dispenser have colored sugar. there is just the right amount of neon and fake trees. Most of the servers seem to be from the former eastern block countries and I am very happy that the wall came down. Hubba Hubba.
If you are over 21, I highly recommend the lounge. dimly lit. benches surrounded by fountains with gas fire in the middle of the water and classy swank cocktail waitresses, dressed in long black dresses, sits down next to you in to take your order. It is a nod to the old Vegas. If you are on the town, this is a great place to wind down an evening with good friends."}
{"text":"Tired of crappy casino cafes?  Need to load up on calories after party rockin all night?  Then, tell the cabby, \"Take me to Peppermill.\"

The Peppermill is a 70s diner, decorated with fake trees, and neon lights. 

They have mutant size chicken parm, big ass omelets, gigalos, huge onion rings, and great customer service.    The people watching in this place is golden, especially at 530am.   The service here is top notch..   

No Vegas trip is complete without payin homage to Peppermill."}
{"text":"WOW this place is expensive... The food was good though but the cost is a little outrageous considering its a bar/lounge...  Cool to sit by the fireplace while you drink a martini. Will come again when forced to entertain out of towners."}
{"text":"When I am on vacation I love to eat at places I can't eat at home. I Googled good restaurant on the Strip and this came up high up there and I was excited to see it wasn't real expensive.  On our first visit as we pulled up I was nervous because it kind of looked like a dive, but the place is nice and clean and has a very nice staff. The food is awesome. We ordered a Fruit salad to start and it was sooo big and super yummy!  It was so big we took half back to our hotel and ate it in the morning for breakfast, and it still tasted great.  We really enjoyed our dinner that we ended up going back 3 times the week we stayed in Vegas. Everything we tried we liked.  Told everyone I know that goes to Vegas often they must try it on their next trip."}
{"text":"The waffle with fruit was the best breakfast I had when I was on vacation in Vegas. My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries that were cooked to perfection. Might look like a strip club when you walk up to the place, but the food is delicious and well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is well worth the wait. The food and service was great. All though if you find yourself waiting for your table in the lounge your going to feel like you wandered into a strip club. But you are in Vegas so why not. Don't let that scare you away!! This place is a must try if your in Vegas !!!!"}
{"text":"Mission:  Find an old-school lounge in Vegas.

This place intrigued me from the start, but I almost didn't walk inside. I thought it would be in a casino, but from the outside it looks like an old Denny's complete with cheesy writing on the windows. But just ignore all the families waiting for a table as you bypass the restaurant and venture to the lounge for tropical drinks and shenanigans.

This is what a 70s pick up bar looks like in my dreams. Jack, Larry, Chrissy and Janet would love it! A dark jungle filled with couches and vines and touches of neon on the ceiling. Servers are lovely ladies in long black dresses slit to the hilt who join you on your lounge when taking your order. If you don't mind being part of the PDA show, sit on a loveseat in the firepit and become mesmerized by the bubbling electric blue liquid. Couples that want a little more privacy, should sit at one of the tables.

The majority of their cocktails are fruity tropical drinks and they pour heavy.  My early drinking days were filled with pina coladas and mai tais, but I've since transitioned to elegant cocktails. So it was like handing the reigns back to my early-20s self. I didn't have a care in the world here. They have a few beers, but nothing on tap. Prices are a bargain compared to other lounges on the Strip.

I've got to admit that there are a few buzzkills to an otherwise ridiculously awesome Vegas experience. There are TVs everywhere and they play a continuous loop of bizarre music videos and performance pieces. For every bit of Vegas spectacle (Cher) there was something absolutely ridiculous (early Mandy Moore or really late Hall & Oats). About half of the acts couldn't even be identified. It was sort of like watching and listening to a slo-mo hair band audio car crash. The more significant issue was the continual interruption of the speaker announcing that tables were ready in the restaurant. 

But if you can tune out those distractions, it is a swingingly good time. Mission accomplished!"}
{"text":"Always my favorite restaurant.  I've been coming here for 21 years.  Great bloody Mary's, food and ambience.  Good service."}
{"text":"Oh, the Peppermill.  It's a must-visit whenever I'm in Vegas.  The atmosphere is kind of hilarious, but in a good way.  Lots of neon lights, what I would call \"costumes\" for the servers, great older music, and endless people-watching opportunities.  The portions are HUGE and the food is great!  Enough to split an entree.  I usually get some type of breakfast dish because they have some of the best hashbrowns.  Great mimosas and bloody mary's but beware of the up-selling skills of the bar/lounge servers!

Tip: They DO NOT split checks.  I repeat, they DO NOT split checks.  Bring cash or use the ATM there to grab cash if you're with a larger party.
Tip: there are dining room servers (funky \"costumes\") and bar/lounge servers (black dresses).  Don't try to order food from the bar/lounge servers or alcoholic beverages from the dining room servers.
Tip: The wait can be pretty insane sometimes.  Be prepared to wait; have a drink in the lounge or play some slots to keep yourself occupied.
Tip: The place is open 24 hours.  On a bender on the strip and starving?  Take an Uber down to the Peppermill - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best place for casual dining in LV.     Great Breakfast too and open 24/7.   Take a cab here if you have to (next to Encore).   You will still save $ over a hotel cafe.    Food is 1000 Xs better too.   

I had Philly Cheesesteak and it was the best.    Also had a Buffalo Chk wrap which was also amazing.    Great fries and great service.

Sit at the counter for some fun watching the whole operation!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was plentiful, atmosphere only a corny Las Vegas local could appreciate and does :). Thank you seriously considering having my next birthday party here."}
{"text":"Classic diner type restaurant. Great \"old Vegas\" atmosphere. Good food!!"}
{"text":"Kind of overpriced for what it is and I wish they would take call in orders for pickup. I've been waiting over 30 minutes for food that I'd tried to order in advance. Aside from the wait,  the atmosphere is pretty cool.  Love the fireside lounge"}
{"text":"Huge portions, great price. The decor was interesting. Looks kind of run down from the outside but the place was packed. I liked that they offered the full menu all day. We went for breakfast and walked in at 8:30 but there was a line out the door by 9:30 when we left."}
{"text":"This was the third time I'd been to Peppermill, and believe it to be a nice novelty.

I'm not sure who did, and why they did decorate the place in purple, lilac, and neon.  I know it is Vegas, but....what?  Also the waitresses are like over 40 hooters retirees.  But then why to analyze too much..it's Vegas.  Check out the bar in the back (yeah its kinda like a surreal Denny's with a bar in the back) there is a fire pit/place.

Worth a visit.  The food is good.  Some items slightly rich.  I've so far had a few different versions of their Eggs Benedict.  This last one was a Steak Benedict.  It was ok, next time I'll take the ham.

Dafe"}
{"text":"Pretty great place! My wife and I went here twice for breakfast while we were in Las Vegas. Outstanding food and cocktails. Mazerati omelet was awesome! Second day had the Pastrami burger. Also amazing. We wanted to come back to the lounge later but we had so much planned, we didn't have much time. Only thing is that the service was a bit slow on the second day when we sat at the breakfast bar. Otherwise, awesome!"}
{"text":"If you come to Vegas, you should have either breakfast, lunch or dinner at least once on your trip.  I'm a regular and have tried just about everything (except red meat) and it's all good.  You should have a  beer and appetizer in the Fireside Lounge, then have your meal in the dining room, Trust me, it's worth it.

The french fries might be the best in town.  Salads are huge!  Everything is huge!

Think the Cheese Cake Factory times 10.  Smaller menu, but has everything you could think of.

I am yet to have a bad dish here.

PS For fun, get the fruit dish or the banana split, you will have the greatest time ever!

SECRET: If you get there and there is a huge line, go all the way in and check the bar in front of the cook station, if there are seats open, you can skip the wait!"}
{"text":"As a Vegas local, the glitz and glamour of the strip can become...exhausting. When you're looking to bring an out-of-towner to a classic, old Vegas joint for a bite - you do the Peppermill. The portions are HUGE, the food is diner-y, and the staff's costumes are absurd. 

On this occasion we over heard the hostess call another diner a 'dumb b*tch' to another staff member, and I was pretty disgusted. Not only should you never speak about a customer this way, there's no excuse for it to be done on the floor in front of other diners. Gross. I left a comment on the comment card at the table. 

The french dip sandwich is so good that my husband gets it every time we go. I've tried some of the appetizers and the BLT - they are typical diner fare, so I'm still searching for my go-to meal at the Peppermill. The menu is arduous and nothing really pops out at you, because it's stuff you've seen before. I'm sure something will eventually tickle my tastebuds. 

Along with the neon lights and indoor trees/garden - you'll find a container of sugar sprinkles on each table which is a lot of fun. I'm not quite sure why each table would need this at all times, but it helps to make Peppermill the Peppermill - and that's okay with me.

A note about the 'in-house photographer': You do not have to purchase photos from them. I don't know why this photographer situation irks me like it does - but I really despise it."}
{"text":"Good ambiance, drinks, go in the early AM if avoiding a crowd, otherwise I'd check out the happy hour time"}
{"text":"I'd like to think that this is one of the best places on the planet. There is nothing I love more than after a long night of drinking to go sit around water on fire and drink a large mimosa....That's not sarcasm.

Obviously this is a super popular restaurant. Anytime someone talks about it, their face lights up with excitement. The lounge area has to be seen to be believed and the dining area is so beautiful and fun with the trees. 

Oh and to top it all off, the food is delicious too. Portions are huge, service is fast and they always keep your coffee cup full. French toast is a definite fave."}
{"text":"OH EM GEEEEEEEEE!!!!
PEPPERMILL HAS THE BEST BREAKFAST IN VEGAS!!!
The portions are huge and your food comes out pretty quickly.
I have a pleasant experience every time I visit.
The wait can get crazy so it is best to arrive early.

I'm not a fan of the mimosas, I think they're too strong...not sweet enough. Something's off!

When you come here they'll offer to take a picture of you while you're seated. Its free to take the picture but its costs to actually take the picture home which is not surprising! 

Cool place, definitely try!!!"}
{"text":"Eating here is like being in a super cool movie from another decade! Fun ambiance, extensive menu & huge portions!!! Definitely a plus that the location is at the end of the strip and away from the normal Vegas hustle & bustle. Easy parking & you have to buy a bag of the multi-colored sugar crystals to take home!!!"}
{"text":"I always make sure to eat here whenever we're in Vegas. Portions are massive and it helps battle the hangover! Get the french toast ambrosia- you'll thank me."}
{"text":"This place has a great lounge area to wait in, I was impressed! The portions are huge and prices are reasonable! The food wasn't anything to write home about. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak and the meat reminded me of Arby's roast beef *yuck* I was not impressed with the food at all. The omelet was very bland and lacked seasoning! Definitely won't be returning for food but maybe I'll visit the lounge!"}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast with my boyfriend. It was our last day in Vegas. I was at first iffy about the place but I'm glad my boyfriend convinced me to try this place. Food was very good & the quality of the food made it taste more better. We had a great server too. Very nosy and loud atmosphere but despite the noise, overall the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on a recommendation from a few people and I will say it was worth it. Good food, good atmosphere. Anyone who eats there, try the biscuits and gravy, they are amazing! Definitely will come back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"This place is a Las Vegas traditional stop every trip my family and I make. I've been going here since I was a teenager. Everything on their menu is so good, and the portions are HUGE! It's an older restaurant, but those are sometimes the best places to eat! The wait can be long depending on the time of day you go, but it is truly worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Here is a hidden gem on the Las Vegas Strip. It is on the North end across the street from Circus Circus. It provides excellent food with large portions and a cheap price. The inside is like stepping back into time for a while. They have the typical diner look, but with a Vegas twist. The best part of this place is the lounge in the back. 

The Fireside Lounge is a great place to start your night or end your morning. The fountain in the middle of the indoor lounge has fire coming out of it and you sit very comfy couches next to it. If you can't find a spot next to it you can plop down in any booth that is open. They have great prices and great service. I work in the hotel industry and suggest this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Whenever the boyfriend and I can't compromise on one restaurant or just have no idea what to eat but just know that no one wants to cook tonight it's off to Peppermill we go.

I've pretty much had most of the salads, soups and a handful of the sandwiches.  My favorite thing off the lunch/dinner menu is the tomato and mozzarella sandwich.  Oh my gosh, thick foccacia style bread, buffalo mozzarella, fresh tomatos, drizzled with balsamic and basil served with a side of fresh fruit.  Yum...I just started drooling thinking about it.  The last time we went I got the steak and mushroom salad thinking it would be a mixed green salad with mushrooms and a couple slices of steak.  No sirree this was the entire piece of meat teetering on a bed of greens.  Granted it wasn't Meyer's Ranch's finest but still for $13.95, holy cow!

Let me not forgot about the most divine part of Peppermill: their breakfast which is served 24 hours.  Of course I've had it at normal hours as well as after leaving the club at 4 AM but the pinnacle of it all is weekend brunch after some hard partying.  Prepare for a 45 minute to an hour wait for a table but so worth it.  Their french toast is melt-in-your-mouth, the eggs benedict is the best classic version I've had in Vegas and their omelettes are too die for and big enough for 2-3 people to share.  Don't forget about their Bloody Marys which are the size of a vase (Rock star tip:  Order an extra shot to ease the transition back to the daylight).

I was torn between 4 and 5 stars because with so many 5 star dining places in Vegas, Peppermill is not the most innovative but I just have to give Peppermill the benefit of the doubt and go with 5 because honestly it is just so d*** good."}
{"text":"Awesome bar lounge area! We got a cute little loveseat right by the fire pit with a private TV to watch the game.  Ordered the sampler appetizer.  Great old school Vegas vibe! Def worth the trip to see a historic piece of Vegas."}
{"text":"Fireside Lounge is awesome. We sat by the fire and shared the Scorpion with ice cream. Alright maybe a bit a girlie but I can see why this was rated one of the best make out bars in Vegas. We were here for about 10 minutes before we gave in and had to snuggle the night away."}
{"text":"This was the first time we tried this old time establishment. The wait was a quick 5 minutes and service was good. I tried the crab cake Benedict for breakfast and it was quite delicious! The two generously sized crab cakes topped the English muffins and were smothered in a nice hollandaise sauce and topped w two perfectly cooked poached eggs. It came with a large side of nicely crisped hashbrowns. The serving was normal-large for a bene but my husband's (delicious) country fried steak and my niece's pancake combo were huge!"}
{"text":"They take time on their drinks.. And they are strong!  This is a must stop whenever you are in vegas.  It..just..looks..WEIRD?!  but really cool.  The food is fantastic and the portions are huge.  Prices are reasonable too.  Dont forget to check out the lounge too.. really cool spot"}
{"text":"this place is like an old las vega classic... i love that they've kept their neon 90's looking theme all these years... the food is.. ok...not amazing... but the coffee is incredible ...The fireside lounge on the other hand is uhmazing... it's so sexy and cool... my favorite drink to get is a simple Pineapple Mimosa... best buzz on the strip!!"}
{"text":"Now that I have found you my lovely Peppermill... I will always visit when I'm in town!
One of the remaining vintage vegas landmarks, so please help this stay alive! We all know how much this town enjoy's getting rid of places. At first when you walk in the neon is confusing... strip club? restaurant? family friendly? bar? 
I agree with most, the atmosphere is instantly fun, and because they add the extra bonus of taking group photos of your table (for free), that makes it better. The food is all american, diner, and easily shareable, and affordable! Great for all ages, and big or small groups.
The lounge has several alcove booths as well as a hot tub looking fire pit at the entrance!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! Busiest time is for breakfast so we usually come around 2 for lunch but breakfast is served all day! Today I got a veggie omelet. It's huge and so good! Pair it with a bloody Mary, u can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place is ahmazing.  The decor is fantastically disco and the food I ate was awesome.  Eggs benedict with no ham served with hashbrowns. - DELISH.  The portions were huge!!
Service left a little to be desired but once we found our waitress, she was great."}
{"text":"All I have to say is , this is a must try place in Vegas.  If you get a drink order the scorpion"}
{"text":"Awesome environment! Great food and good service. Definitely an old school feel. Worth checking out if you like unique spots."}
{"text":"This place was just weird. From the outside it looks upscale but when you go inside it looks like a cheap diner. The decor is just old and outdated but I still can't decide if I liked it for the vintage Vegas effect or if I hated it, haha. There are weird fake plants/flowers behind the tables??? We were afraid the food would be expensive and disgusting but our party of 10 was pleasantly surprised that it was delicious and fairly priced. My cheesey potato soup was very tasty and the creamy chicken dish I got was phenomenal! Everyone else in my party also had a great meal. definitely a weird gem on the Strip!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! This is a true gem on the strip, and I fell in love with it. The wait staff are friendly,  you get large portions, intimate setting,  hip,  and affordable. If you are in Vegas check this place out you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places to eat while on the Strip! Food is always great and portions are huge!"}
{"text":"The waiter did not come to the table for 10 minutes. The drinks took 15 minutes to come out. They got there as we were leaving. If you want to wait for ever and be ignored, go to this restraunt. I think it may be time to implode this vegas landmark."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is my all time favorite place to go in Vegas. Open 24 hours so it's perfect for whenever you want a huge meal. 

Yes all dishes are huge! So don't be scared by the price. Amazing food. Fresh fruit,and my goodness the most amazing coffee out there. 

The atmosphere is perfect for the strip. It can be a little loud at times, but I think that goes to show how much fun you can have. 

Enjoy!

My favorite: yogurt parfait (fresh fruit)

Oh! Don't forget to check out the lounge if you're old enough of course :)"}
{"text":"I've come to the Peppermill many times over the last 20 years and have always enjoyed the lounge and the restaurant on occasion. Today, I decided I wanted to order some food and go pick it up. I called and the women on the phone (who I assume is a manager, Peggie maybe?) said they won't take the order by phone, I have to come in, order and wait. This is ridiculous. I've never heard of a fast casual restaurant, not willing to take a pickup order by phone. When I told her that it sounds like they don't want my business, she said \"sorry.\" 

It's not worth loosing guests over doing something that's standard in the industry."}
{"text":"The food was great , great value for the price and very good service. The only down side is they could use booths with a little more room."}
{"text":"Kitschy, not a problem. Slightly elevated diner food, no problem.$4 Charge for soda water...?seriously?!! Was excited to come here and my experience was irreversibly tainted by a frankly pointless and just greedy new cash grab. I'd seen this  nastiness I before and thought Vegas was still Vegas. Nope! Cash grab company line it is. Thought better of you Peppermill, apparently to much to ask for."}
{"text":"Food here is amazing there all big portions but worth what your paying for the wings n nachos are very good the milkshakes also there pancakes!!! the inside is very 70s,i like the fireside lounge is my personal fav with a full bar its a very chill enviroment the cocktails are amazing the best one is the SCORPION!!!! but be warned it packs a punch!! staff is very friendly and always helpfull i surely will be coming back !"}
{"text":"The worst place in Las Vegas.  Food was not good, salad wilted, and my stump cocktail was warm and slimly.  Had to wait for the bartender server to come get our drinks. The waitress could not give us our drinks. We had to wait almost 15 minutes just to get our drinks prior to dinner. I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody I know or friends. Worst experience in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Have to say, great 24 hour diner. My cohorts went to bed early because of a long day ahead for tomorrow, but I'm a late night person (usually go to bed around 3:30-4am) so I left them in the room & went exploring. We were staying at Circus Circus, and after walking around for an hour just checking things out I decided to kill a little bit of time playing slots. Now, I'm not into gambling but I figured I'm in Vegas so I might as well do a little bit of gambling. Within 5 minutes of sitting down I won over $20 on a slot machine so I decided I would cash out & use the money for a late night steak dinner. I didn't see anything at Circus Circus that fit the bill so I went out walking and within a few blocks saw The Peppermill. I figured that was the place.

It was pretty much packed so I sat at the counter. After looking the menu over I quickly decided on the New York Strip & eggs. The place was bustling with patrons & countless waitresses buzzing around. I ordered my steak rare, my eggs sunny side up, the hash browns crispy & an English muffin. The waitress was nice, friendly & attentive.

Everything came out as ordered. The 'shred' on the hash browns were larger than typical but I found them to make the texture even better than the normal shred. I found nothing wrong with each item in my dinner. The steak was rare, tender & trimmed properly. Eggs were spot on sunny side up. Hash browns crispy. Everything was exactly what I was wanting in a late night dinner. Adding a few dollars for a tip to my winnings, I paid & left satisfied."}
{"text":"A complete and total rip off even begin to describe how high the prices are at this joint! 

Expect a $15.00 burger or higher and that's a special.  HA!  

They must figure they can charge these prices because they are on the strip. (But I have a car and drove elsewhere) 

Ridiculous prices for an old vintage place on the strip."}
{"text":"The Peppermill was a gem of a find for late night eats on this end of the strip.  We were staying at the Westgate and every restaurant inside the hotel closes early so we hopped a cab ride over to the Peppermill for good eats.  Enjoyed their breakfast menu - had a ham & cheese omelette and then a bacon/lettuce/cheese sandwich another late night. Both were delicious. Prices were average for a diner. Good service, the wait staff was friendly and attentive. Had about a 15 minute wait one day during brunch hours but that was to be expected. Enjoyed the tacky Vegas decor and they even have a separate bar/lounge area with a huge fire pit.  I would definitely return here while in Vegas."}
{"text":"I like the lounge to have a quiet drink in but the food is really bad.  out of the freezer, into the fryer is not a recipe for good eats."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Glad we got to experience a years long Vegas tradition, not to mention a damn good breakfast. We went early on a Tuesday morning and had no wait. Cute atmosphere, and the wait staff were friendly and professional. Would love to go back soon."}
{"text":"Hey EDCers, this is the spot you want to go to if you want to continue being engulfed in a luminous atmosphere. I just adore the black light decor.

And the food is gigantic! Just like multiple media sources said. 

TBH though, I don't even remember the taste of the food, so I'm guessing it wasn't good enough to stick in my memory? I was completely sober, and this was about 8 am in the morning. But I will definitely go back and give it another chance in the future."}
{"text":"My wife had eggs benedict that were okay.  I had the Marco Pollo Omelet with a bagel.  It was delicious.  I had to take half of it home, and I usually eat a lot."}
{"text":"My review is based off the lounge not the actual restaurant. 

So you walk in the lounge you see hot pink neon and a indoor firepit. Also very dark so you get strippers on acid vibe. No worries it's just a lounge with classy servers. So my group decided to get a scorpion bowl. Well that drink is the size of my head. We all drink from it and being the drunks we  are oder more. Run of the mill bar food. Nothing too crazy, goes to my theory most of vegas food is based on how drunk the patron is."}
{"text":"Use to go here years ago after leaving the clubs.  Was always good 
Went a few weeks ago for breakfast.  Everything was good.  
But expect a wait 10 mins approximately"}
{"text":"SO AWESOME. We loved this place! This is Vegas! Built in the 70's and I am so going to get mad at my parents for not taking me here earlier!  Seriously. This place is cute. Lots of trees and small flowers with flamingo tiffany-style lamps and the lounge is to die for. That water fire thing is gorgeous. That's vegas, baby! Big food, big drinks, good service. I also won some monies on the way in which set the tone off right!"}
{"text":"This should be a required stop for breakfast on any Vegas trip. Seriously! If you haven't been, you need to go.

This place is always busy, so be prepared for the wait. 

The wait is well worth it though. 

The food has been great every single time we have been here. Large portions that are almost sharable. 

Service is always great and I love that they are all dressed up fancy. 

The pricing is average and you totally get your monies worth.

They make an excellent bloody mary as well.

Go get your breakfast on!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Peppermill in 20 years.  We stopped there a few times when we were tourists.  I decided to go today for a different breakfast place.

I arrived about 9:45 and the place was packed.  There was a waiting list for a table, but the counter was open so I went there.  Angela was my server and she immediately got me some coffee.  I have read about the big portions.  It starts with their over-sized coffee mugs.  Very nice.

I ordered the Fruit fantasia waffle, a good sized waffle topped with seasonal fresh fruit and served with boysenberry syrup and butter and whipped cream or sour cream for a topping.  The waffle had a lot of fruit--bananas, grapes, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and strawberries.  It was excellent.

This is an institution that has been around for a lot of years and based on the people there today, it will be around for a lot more."}
{"text":"This was on my list of places I must go. I've passed by here many times but never went in. Well I was missing out. This place is awesome. I was totally surprised with the size of the meals and how fast they serve the orders. We ate here 3 times during this trip and it's rare for me to eat the same place twice let alone 3 times. The omelette I ordered was so large I could not eat the whole thing and the small pancakes were huge and could be on a extra large plate by themselves. You must go but get there before 9 am during breakfast or you will be waiting a little bit."}
{"text":"What a fun restaurant to hold your event.  We celebrated my mom's 80th B Day at the Peppermill.  The manager could not have been more helpful.  The Peppermill made menus for our event in my mother's favorite color. The package included the menus, balloons, table clothes and our own waiter. The food and service was awesome. i would  highly recommend the Peppermill for your event!"}
{"text":"I don't think people understand, or at least fully comprehend how much I love Las Vegas. Sure it holds a lot of sentimental value for me, but once you get over all the things people HATE Vegas for, you realize how amazing this Postmodern Paradise is in all its glory. 

That said, I'm so happy that a place like Peppermill exists, but pretty disappointed that it's taken me 27 years to finally discover and go here. 

This place is SOOOOOO cheesy Vegas - I know there's a Canter's in Vegas, but if Canter's fully embraced the aesthetic of the city, it would look like this place. The ceiling, walls and columns are adorned with mirrorball tiles, the lampshades are stained glass flamingos, and every plant i the place is made of plastic. Even the sugar are rainbow sprinkles! Just don't get too excited and then having to deal with an entire handful of the stuff you have no business really holding. 

The menu is pretty comprehensive - you've got steak, sammies and everything a 24/7 diner-like place should have. Prices are kind of on the steep side, but the food is tasty. We went there at 11pm after spending an entire day in the sun with thousands of others watching awesome bands and had nothing to consume all day with the exception of a cup of cereal in the morning and a beer here and there throughout the day. By the time we got there, we were all FAMISHED. 

The varied menu made it hard to choose, but I nabbed myself a pastrami sandwich, which was perhaps on my top ten list of Best Choices I've Made in My Short Life. It may have been the fact that I was super hungry, but I do not exaggerate when I say I was nearly reduced to tears after each bit of my cured meat on sourdough bread I was so happy. I chewed with the biggest smile on my face while a chorus of angels one can hear even past the super loud decor surrounding me. If I was challenged to marry the thing, I would have plowed over my boyfriend and dashed to the nearest chapel where Elvis would have married us, and our honeymoon would be spent skipping the \"honeymoon\" part and would have gone directly to praying mantis mode and devoured my mate. It was that good. 

Oh, I sampled other peoples' food as well, and it was all pretty good. 

But back to my sandwich. I don't know...we may have been caught up in the moment, maybe it was just good timing. I don't know if I were to return, things would be the same, but maybe...just maybe, I'll give it a try."}
{"text":"I thought this would be a nice place to grab some food and it was. This place usually provides real good service. However, tonight I ordered chicken nachos with no jalapenos. I came in with my TT, sister and a close friend of me and my sister. I had to wait nearly 20 minutes for my food while everybody had their food. It wasn't too busy and I was a bit annoyed. The waitress was pretty nice and patient with us so it wasn't her fault. I really don't appreciate when other workers roll their eyes and scoff while were eating. You guys should be glad that you have guests. Without us you won't have a paycheck. The staff needs to work on being a bit more professional as I overheard an employee complain about her shift. I myself work graveyard for another restaurant. All I'm saying is that be more professional and don't complain to other co workers about your shift. The whole staff needs to be more professional. Not the usual service I get when I come here. It's still a great place to spend money on food."}
{"text":"Embrace the neon...love the neon.  Sure, it looks like a converted IHOP, but inside, this place is neon and fire lit hipster madness."}
{"text":"My wife and I had in planned anniversary dinner for May 27th  which was a Sunday, our guests arrived before we did (830pm) all WOMEN of African American descent. My guest asked  for water in which they were not given,   The manager Mo told them they had to order 1st before they can get water. They were even asked to leave when \"me an my wife\" did not show up @830, But we had a live Professional Photographee who arrived @ 8pm and checked in for us and they were still they were not treated fairly thewaitress Leilan did not make any attempt to settle the issues at the table was having. She in fact said \"that if we didn't like the service or if we were unhappy we could go somewhere else\". which I thought was not customer service at all, and that is not how you handle customers issue! From here we were ask how we would be paying for the table because there was about 8 of us and they don't split checks so everything has to be on one bill(which was understood before arriving to the establishment) we said that was fine and that we will be paying cash, Leliae said I was fine and then a few minutes later came back to the table and as for a debit or credit card to be placed on hold which is odd I've never heard of this being done at a resturant. Especially since we weren't sitting at a bar we were sitting at a lounge, so having an open tabs or and open credit card should not have been necessary I'm very curious now as to if this is a policy that they follow. Because we also watched another group come down and sit we payed very close attention to if they were also asked to put a credit card or debit card on hold and for some reason that never happen. Then we also notice that that table was a group of white people were as we were all 8 African American decent women. We had a live professional photographer a for who was going to capture as very special moment and make it very memorable for me and my wife. The pepper mill was absolutely rude and uncommodating and by far the last time 8 African American women  Will spend their money. And to add the table that was to are right prior to Arrival had witness the entire enteraction an the experience my guest had to go through and they got up and left and did not buy anything and also apologize to my guest for how they were being treated.  The bill turned out to be a $108 which was not at all expensive  On the receipt it shows that the time we checked in was at 9:24 p.m. when  In all actuality my guest arrived at 8:30 p.m. their request for water was refused at 8:45 p.m. and  arrived at peppermill @ 9:20 p.m.  Pepper mill has displayed their self to have races tendencies and they do not care about the African American and their money I will never and my guest will never spend another dime at PEPPERMILL LOUNGE RESTUARANT!!!  And being a person who loss a friend in October 1 shooting and this is how Vegas restaurant treats there Locals?! By FAR THE WORSE RESTURANT EXPERIENCE! PEPPERMILL WAS A RECOMMEMDATION FROM Local First Responders and this is one for the books."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is my must-go restaurant every time I'm in Vegas. It's got that old school Las Vegas diner feel, excellent service, and huge, hangover-curing portions.

I absolutely love the decor. It's not modem by any means but it's got charm and I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"broccoli and egg omelet was delicious! i think it cost 12.00 so it was reasonable. the waiter brought out delicious glasses of tap water to go with it!

hash browns were acceptable./ nothing to brag about. wheat toast was standard

this place exceeded my expectations for 3:00 a.m. on a saturday morning in vegas. no wait to be seated and plenty of tables. lots of staff working too

i would go back."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to start writing Yelp reviews for a while now, and I've repeatedly considered what business would receive my first review. I've decided that it HAS to be the Peppermill and it HAS to be five stars.

(For this review, I'm focusing strictly on the lounge.)

My wife and I are Las Vegas locals now, but we've been frequenting the Fireside Lounge since our tourist days. We came here on the night we got engaged. We came here on the night we got married. We come here on our birthdays and anniversaries. There simply isn't any place in town more comfortable and romantic for a couple of kitsch lovers like us.

Sure, the strip location means it gets crowded on the weekends - moreso lately than it used to, it seems - but scoring a seat on one of the plush pink couches around the firepit makes it more than worth the trip. The waitresses are super-friendly and they'll remember you between visits.

My only complaints are that the drinks are a little weak and the music selection a little poppy. The former is because I've been conditioned by super-strong Fink Bombs at Frankie's Tiki Room, and the latter is because I'm apparently a hipster douche. Neither complaint is worth tarnishing a perfect score.

The Peppermill is easily one of our favorite places on the entire globe and now it's only a couple of miles down the street from us. We're so lucky to now live so close to this neon-encrusted gem."}
{"text":"Sooo we came in here on July 4th at 5am after a night out on the town ..... we were starving and just wanted a good meal . Well our food took over an hour and the place was not that busy.... our waitress was not tentative at all ... our food was cold and it was an overall bad experience. The manager gave us 50% off our bill which was cool but still it was just a bad experience . Won't be coming back ever again. One star for the discount ."}
{"text":"Very nice Vegas vibe while keeping an old school diner feel. I walked in with a coworker and decided to eat at the  front bar area. Food came fast, huge plate, and the waitress was attentive to refills etc. Not to mention, it was  super busy there. Will definitely come back here on my next visit."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great service and delicious! We come and eat here every time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ok, just to make sure you all understand, this place is on the earth solely for the purpose of helping you shovel the largest amount of food possible into your stomach. My omelette was about the size of a football.

Tasty, though."}
{"text":"Awesome! Huge servings and great food, sat at counter and watched all the food get delivered to tables, it all looked delicious! Coffee was great!"}
{"text":"Depending on whether you head into the lounge or the restaurant, this place is most likely overhyped a bit. This review is just for the lounge portion of the restuarant. 

I stopped in on the bar side after attending YSB on Sunday evening. The decor is funky and eclectic. Lots of mirrors, plants, and neon lights. Beyond that there was nothing very special about his bar. Their signature giant drink was much smaller than its reputation. A limited bar menu is also available in case you don't want to drink on an empty stomac. It was relatively quiet insided so you didn't have to yell at the top of your lungs in order to have a conversation.

I think there are better bars/lounges with better value, drinks, and food."}
{"text":"Food great huge portions staff on it they get a star less because it was hot and stuffy in the restaurant and there was a funny smell"}
{"text":"If I took a Denny's and tried to make it classier I'd get a peppermill. It's ok but more expensive than I thought it should be. Decent food. Service was friendly enough. Good thing we didn't need anything though cause the waitress wasn't around much. Not terrible but I wouldn't go back unless I had limited restaurant choices."}
{"text":"The best place to eat a late-night meal from the 1am until breakfast hours....the menu has something for everyone, from breakfast staples to hearty dinner plates. Expect the prices to be a bit high, but for a place this kitschy and for the portion size it only makes sense, and anywhere this gimmicky on the strip is going to be a bit expensive. Other than that, its a REALLY fun place, the decor is crazy fun, and the waitresses are beautiful and friendly. A great place to get a late night/early morning meal and just enjoy Vegas and all of its strangeness."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. My boyfriend and I are bartenders and know how the whole restaurant deal goes. We came in around 5am for breakfast and we get it: It's early in the morning, drunk people are still coming by to eat, plastered from the clubs, it gets annoying. 

Once we arrived, I was super stoked to eat. It's beautiful inside with the neon lights and a retro Diner! It was so cool looking.

Food: I got the eggs Benedict with the poached eggs and he got the crab cake Benedict with poached eggs. The eggs were NOT poached but mine was still delicious, he wasn't so hot on the crab cakes.

Drinks: We started off with waters and decided to get Bloody Mary's since I saw a few reviews saying they were delicious, so we gave it a go! First off, the cocktail waitress took 15 minutes to get to us and the bar was not busy and the restaurant itself wasn't that crowded. She finally came by and we decided to get mild spice with Kettle One Vodka (for 2 - $21). Keep in mind, they only put single shot liquor in their drinks unless requested a double. Secondly, we tasted absolutely no alcohol and even with a single shot you can taste a little something. We tasted watered down Bloody Mary mix lol was completely disappointed.

Our server: Amanda was sweet. Towards the end, we shouldn't have to wait more than 20 minutes for our bill and was even more frustrated to see her just sitting down at a table talking with someone I'm guessing she knew right across from us. Get it together girlfriend. I'm sure working in Vegas is a hit or miss with tips but decent service can make a huge difference. 

When it came to our bill, we kindly asked if it was possible to take my drink off since I barely drank mine and my boyfriend was a trooper and drank mostly his. She rudely said that problem doesn't go to her, it's all on the bartenders and she'll get the manager for us.... okay. 
The manager came by (Austin, we THINK. Pretty tall dude with brown hair. I don't know, I probably heard his name wrong) ANYWHO, we kindly told him what the deal was and he suggested to put an extra shot because they can't comp off drinks for whatever reason. We declined the suggestion since I no longer wanted to continue drinking it regardless but we still had to pay. The bill ended up being $56.61..... 

I personally and strongly don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent! The best deal in Vegas! Good food, reasonable pricing - served up with a smile! Expect to wait for a table!"}
{"text":"We always stop here on our way home the food is so good and the bloody Mary's are like no other. If you like horse radish you have to try it in your Bloody Mary soooo good"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place, but it is a must go to when I am in Vegas. Maybe it's the large portions given, maybe it's the atmosphere. The ambiance takes me back to old school Vegas, where you might enjoy a lounge singer in the corner as entertainment. The vibrant colors and neon lights make you think that at any moment you are about to witness strippers on the tables. The servers are all friendly and handle business, considering this place is always packed. 

The food is really good and the portions are large. Whether I have ordered salad, breakfast or dinner, I have always enjoyed my food. 

Dine or Dash? Dine. Every time I am in Vegas and so should you!"}
{"text":"Where do I start, I love this place as I have over the past 25 years. This is truly an iconic place to go when your visiting the strip. The food, service and ambiance of this place has remained the same without change from when my parents started going before me. The strip may look good but at least this place hasn't changed!"}
{"text":"When our out of town guests fly in the first thing we do is go to breakfast. This place is located on the strip next to the Riviera Hotel & Casino in a stand alone building. But if you're in a hurry go somewhere else. 

Sadly, after this last visit I won't be running back. It's always packed and that's expected, but the service was way too slowwwwwwwww. I really hope they make these improvements because they have delicious pancakes and killer Bloody-Mary's. 

Food was overpriced but each plate could feed 4 people so you won't be cheated when you see your platter appear. But if you have a hearty appetite or have a car full of linebackers or truckers they will appreciate the portion size.  

Sadly my order wasn't great. My omelet with spinach was the consistency of sponge cake-yucky.  Our waitress forgot to get us water.  So trying to wave her down and find her was wearing me down.

I don't like to spend hours and hours in a restaurant with most of time just sitting around waiting for a waitress. I want to eat and get on with my day.

Sorry, but  I've had my Fill of the Peppermill:("}
{"text":"We were recommended to the Peppermill by our Uber driver. So much history in this place and the portions could carry you for days. Will definitely recommend this to friends coming into Vegas for sure"}
{"text":"Great service. Good value. The food is served in massive portions. For the most part, it is a safe and enjoyable experience if you are visiting Vegas. Especially good for families. Share your plates! I had a crab cake Benedict (nice, with three eggs). Hash browns came cold, but attendant was quick to make it up and bring another plate. My companion had a ham steak that was fit for the Brawny Man. It was salty, but management made a concentrated effort to accommodate her (she choose something else). All in all - cool ambience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots on the strip that's open 24/7. No nonsense, no frills, just old school Las Vegas charm. Good food, good  drinks, and good service. If you come here for Sunday breakfast or brunch... be prepared for a super long wait.  Except for the the lounge/bar area and late nights, this is generally a good family spot too. I've seen a few celebs at this low key spot on several occasions too. Holly Madsen of The Girls Next Door and Peepshow frequents this place!"}
{"text":"I might just move to Vegas so I can go to the Peppermill everyday. How do you not love a place with neon and firepits and hanging silk flowers from the ceiling? Oh... and rainbow sugar! The breakfast rocks. We had some egg,sausage,spinach,hashbrown,cheese sauce concoction... something San Francisco.  And the French Toast plate. Total yumminess. Hell the food coulda sucked and I would still love this place!! 10 a.m and waitresses in flowing black satin cocktail dresses. I want to live here. Anthony Bourdain, thank you for turning me on to this place!! I cannot wait to come here at 3 am.!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't what we expected. Not our favorite of the trip. Was cool seeing it for the history factor. If I went again I would stick to a sandwich and maybe a dessert. Those looked good but not what we had. Nachos was kinda crappy and the chicken Alfredo was bland.  
Awesome clean atmosphere though. Maybe what we ordered ?"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is an Las Vegas classic with great food and generous portions. The full menu is available in the dining room while the back room, the fireside lounge, has a limited bar menu and the best Bloody Mary's in Vegas!"}
{"text":"What a cool joint ! The decor and lightning are so 1970s and I love it. The fire and water pit is so unique located indoors. The service was prompt and the place was very clean. Had cocktails and an order of fries. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"If you're anywhere near this restaurant in Vegas, you really should try it for breakfast.  It's very, very Vegas.  Over-the-top huge portions.  Dim, neon-ish lighting that can make you forget it's day outside.  A full drink menu at any hour of the morning.  The place seems designed for people who can't quite cope with the fact that the night is over and they drank too much -- you can head right to the dimly-lit Peppermill and get yourself some hair of the dog.  I don't mean any of this in a bad way -- the food was decent, if not exceptional.  And despite the 24-hour drink menu and all, there were plenty of families with kids, it was fine for that."}
{"text":"Such an epic mix of great service, good food and Las Vegas history. It's got waitresses in tiny skirts and cocktail servers in fancy slinky gowns--at 8 am. If you remember what vacation destinations were like in the 80s, or were to young to, this place is a good start. Don't expect hip, nu or bleeding edge coolness. This place is old, classic cool. Tons of parking and easy to get to from anywhere in the strip. 
My food was great. Didn't even blink at my special request. Happy. Happy. Happy. And the Bloody Mary was the perfect top to a great breakfast."}
{"text":"What a totally unique place. Night club style lounge with blacklight and firepit and the the restaurant itself had \"cherry trees\" inside. A little on the expensive side but it was worth it. Separate servers for cocktails and food.

Place was packed at 10. Breakfast served all hours. We waited in the lounge for our name to be called and had a mimosa, which came in a huge glass with ice, more like a mimosa cocktail. It was really good! Wait for 2 was only about 15min.

Had the ambrosia french toast. These photos don't do it justice. The plate was huge! Served with sour or whipped cream, both of which were very good. I wasonly able to eat half along with my side of eggs. My bf ordered a standard meal and asked for the bacon extra crispy but it came out almost undercooked...just the way I like it. He had another special request which was taken down but didn't happen but he was in love with their toast so that made it all better."}
{"text":"I give this 5 stars because it is exactly what it started out to be in the 70's. The very last of 'Old Vegas' that remains! I was there today, stopped on my way to the airport with some friends for Brunch. My friends LOVED everything about this place, the food , the service and the ambiance unparalleled! Anyone who disparages the ambiance has got a screw loose, I tell them go back to the strip then where all they care about now is taking your money! The Peppermill was and is now a great place to go with friends, fill your stomach with great food and walk down \"Memory Lane\" !! I will always take my visitors there because it is an experience!"}
{"text":"Food was a 3
Service was a 5

Our waitress was from the midwest as I am, so we laughed & talked & she told us her life story. Lol the food was good for late night food. I had the hotwings they were kinda hard, but I ate them anyway. Hubby said his burger & onion rings were delicious. It's a cool spot. 

There's a lounge area in the back that's REALLY cool looking that I'd check out again."}
{"text":"Went here with my date late night after the Stevie Wonder concert. Unfortunately we were unable to experience the Fireside Lounge but The Peppermill Restaurant was Great! They had very good food I'm a breakfast type guy so I ordered 3 pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage; it was a menu item but I forgot what it was called. My date ordered the 3 cheeseburger sliders and onion rings. Like I said the food was very good and they have large portions so make sure when you come you have a pretty empty stomach, we didn't even finish our food but they made for great leftovers."}
{"text":"I don't come to the Peppermill for the food...I bring my family and friends to the Peppermill because of the Fireside Lounge. Old School VEGAS at it's finest. Like a through back to the Rat Pack Days. Awesome atmosphere and the best late night spot to unwind and take in the Vegas Vibe. A must for any couple or group of friends to check out whenever you're in Vegas. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Go here all the time, its a go to spot if you want food and great atmosphere.  One of the few restaurants that local will brave the strip to come done to."}
{"text":"This place is what I refer to as HOT & Alot.
Portions are huge. Service was good and friendly but the food is not good. Its a step up from Denny's. At least Denny's is cheap."}
{"text":"Old school, retro everything...and I LOVE IT! Perfect spot to grab a quick bite after a night out on the Strip. 

Came in at around midnight and we're so pleased to see that there actually wasn't a wait! The place is huge and is completely decorated with the theme!

The offer almost everything you could be craving at the middle of the night. The best part is, the portions ARE HUGE especially for the price. I ordered the Yogurt Parfait and WOW it could have probably served 5 people. It reminded me a lot of McDonald's parfait but with much much better quality fruits and granola. Other notable dishes: Tangy Buffalo Chicken Wrap (the curly fries with it is AMAZING), Joe's San Francisco Special, and Tostada Omelet. 

The service was not bad! For the most part, everything was what you would expect from a diner so I'm perfectly pleased. Definitely will be back to check out their Fireside Lounge though!!"}
{"text":"My mom, sister. And I went here for breakfast on a Sunday. Luckily Vegas wasn't crazy busy and there wasn't much of a line on Sunday around 1. We had the option of waiting for a table, but we decided to do the countertops and sat down immediately. We each order one plate and none of us could finish our food. I suggest ordered one meal per couple cause it's just overkill with food. Vanilla shake is delicious! But make sure you have an empty belly, 22 oz for 6.95, that's a steal!"}
{"text":"This is your late night / hangover food destination. They know what they are and do a great job at it. The wait can get long but the diner bar is first come first serve so check there if they're not any tables."}
{"text":"Obscene servings.  Probably perfect for the hangover.  Interest items, taste okay.  Good customer service.  Old style Vegas decor."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is Eggscellent!!

The Peppermill has been around a long time. It's an old school favorite of mine and a go-to restaurant back in the early 2000's. The Peppermill has not changed in years and full of enough neon to have their own Neon Museum.  I love it!!

The food portions tend to be the highlight at the Peppermill.  Every dish is on steroids.  For the bros out there, I don't mean that literally.  They hook it up to the max at the Peppermill and still manage to keep the price per meal very low.  I used to come here for their burgers, fries, nachos, and desserts.  They're all good.  But now, it's all about their 10 egg omelets.  That's not a typo...10 freakin' eggs AND it's still served with toast & hash browns.  I even talked to one of the shift leaders and she stated that most people eat only half of their meals here.  Well, not this guy. I will deMELish their omelets every chance I get.  Their omelets are so good that it would be a shame if I had any leftovers. 

This restaurant is always busy and a wait for a seat should be expected.  The service is top notch as well.  I highly recommend the Peppermill, especially if you're craving a beast of an omelet. 

Just a note...
Some people have mentioned that the Peppermill looks like strip club inside. All that's missing is a stripper pole.  I beg to differ with these people and think they got it backwards.  I think a strip club looks more like a Peppermill.  All that's missing is their 10 egg omelet.  

2017 Yelp Review #52"}
{"text":"Amazing service, wonderful coffee, great steak & eggs, and the world's best bloody mary!!!! Will definitely return when we are in Vegas again."}
{"text":"This is the gaudy, neon-covered lounge of my dreams. I was in town for business on Valentine's Day and looking for a spot to drink a brightly colored cocktail on a velvet couch with my queen of a coworker, Taylor S. The Peppermill came recommended by a few trusted Yelpers and I'm so glad we gave it a go!

Everything screams Vegas at the Peppermill--from the colorful neon sign outside to the outrageous cocktail menu, it's all just so fun. We found ourselves a couch in the fire lounge which was surprisingly not crazy busy for a holiday. Our server was dressed to the nines in an evening gown and was super sweet. I ordered a Blue Hawaiian cocktail which honestly wasn't that good, but the bright blue hue totally fit the vibe. They've got some super indulgent drinks with thing like whipped cream and chocolate chip cookies in them if you're into that sort of thing--you can also get a solid dirty martini (according to Ms Taylor). 

The lounge only serves apps, so we ordered a giant plate of nachos to split. It comes with a side of refried beans doused in some sort of fake cheese. The nachos weren't the best ever (I'm seeing a trend here), but they got the job done and the portion was enormous for the price. There was also a lady onsite taking photos and giving out a free print in celebration of Vday. You could also buy extras for like $20, but I loved my free little souvenir. 

All in all this place is cheesy (in more than one way) and amazing. I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Sin City!"}
{"text":"My parents took me here when I was a kid. That's how old this place is. 

This was in the 80's, when your parents sent you and your sibling off with a $100 bill each morning to entertain ourselves all day and night at Circus Circus and other hotels. To get around, we'd catch cabs like New Yorkers and would only go back to our hotel when we ran out of money. Parents. They had it so easy back then.

They say you can never go back to the old days, and going to the Peppermill lounge as an adult is that adage personified. (Not that I was in the lounge section as a kid.) Questionable quality of food that's highly recommended as delicious by all their waitstaff (???) strong, strong, STRONG drinks and hilarious dim lighting, accented by the blue pools of flames that the round booths surround. 

It's so gauche, you kinda have to like it. Or be awed by it. If Jem and the Holograms had their own bar...this would be it. 

But...

I wouldn't want to get out of control drunk here.

It's far from everywhere else; randomly located on the Strip. Avoid the food, have a couple of cocktails and ease yourself back on the road."}
{"text":"Almost 4 stars for us. The restaurant has a nice parking lot. It has a cool atmosphere. We breakfast with eggs and chicken fried steak. It was good. We also took advantage of the half price appetizers and ordered chips and salsa. We would not get that again. There was a person come by to take a complimentary picture. Too bad my eyes were closed. Oh well. Would recommend to visit."}
{"text":"The Peppermill serves huge portions, is kid friendly and has insane desserts. That having been said it's even better for a date night. The drinks are huge and visually remarkable, the fire pit is too notch and the atmosphere and quirks are great. It also happens to be a Las Vegas iconic location and is the last free standing restaurant on the Strip - proper."}
{"text":"I had amazing service so I thought I would give her a five-star yelp the food was probably a 3 to 4 star but she made up for it and the fact that they didn't hassle my service animal I like them even more.  I had the club sandwich and my date had the French dip they were both mediocre but I will say the french fries in the onion rings were very tasty and they give you a huge portion next time we're splitting something.   Virginia was our server and we loved her"}
{"text":"Came in to have some breakfast wait was 30 mins we went to the lounge to have a drink in the meantime while waiting we sat by the fire and had a drink once we got seated the food was delish!! Love that they give you the option of toast, bagel, muffin. The ambience is good totally 80's vibe definitely be back when in town."}
{"text":"awesome 24hr joint better thannnnn denny's!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Never ever go here if you want a snack. :)  HUGE PORTIONS! We've enjoyed visiting the Peppermill over the years.  You have to give it a try if you haven't been.  The ice cream sundaes are huge/wonderful.  Quality food at an affordable price. Staff... friendly and the service is pretty quick. 

Go check it out."}
{"text":"This place is a cool spot to impress your friends. Whether you come to eat or come to drink. The decor is like stepping into a club. The service is classic diner style, very good. Now the food, it wasn't all that but everything else makes up for it. Bring your friends or your significant other for a romantic evening."}
{"text":"This was a bright spot in the culinary adventures of Vegas.  We went for a early dinner before heading to the airport and it was lovely.  The restaurant is clean and have awesome decor---I felt like I was in Vegas eating somewhere that I should see people or that it should be 4am and I should be getting a huge breakfast after a night out at the clubs.  The restaurant had a couple of others in it (we're talking dinner at 3:45 so its even early for the early birds) but they sat everyone in places where you didn't feel like you were on top of the others.  Service was prompt, nice, informative, and thorough.  The food was great, I had a fantastic salad, and my bf had a sandwich which looked yummy.  When he realized it had bacon on it, and he doesn't eat pork, the waitress took it back no questions asked and had a new one made for him.  The manager stopped by to ask if everything was okay, and thanked us for coming in.  I would highly recommend Peppermill to anyone going to vegas for quality food, reasonable prices, fun atmosphere, and genuine service."}
{"text":"It stopped in here for nostalgia, I worked at Peppermill in CO 30 years ago.
It was cool to the the same layout and uniforms. Just the colors are different.
Good food and service (Elisha) and it was packed at 11:30, on a wait.
Peggy the manager was very friendly, and it was good to hear that Bill P. (owner) was still around.
Keep up the excellence!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is my favorite vegas spot! Great food at a great price and an awesome lounge area with an awesome fire pit! I've always had good service and an overall great experience here! I always recommend it to anyone traveling to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Las Vegas 35 years. The Peppermill is a classic place, actually timeless. Whenever I have guests from out of town I love to take them here. The portions are big and the prices are reasonable. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Sitting fireside with a big ass foo-foo drink is something I have now checked off my bucket list. Yes, I have always wanted to get all swanky-like and enjoy a huge cocktail over some comfortable conversation while lounging on vinyl. I did it here and it was friggin' epic."}
{"text":"This is a must see!  Very low key and retro.  As the other reviews have mentioned it is tacky, but it is a fun tacky.  The analogy to a limo is spot on.  It was relaxing watching music video's by the bubbling fire pit while sipping some good drinks at a good value.  I also agree with the comment that this would be a good place to eat after going on a bender.  I had an egg skillet that was HUGE and delicious with spicy sausage.  It almost reminded me of a garbage plate in a good way."}
{"text":"First time ever at this place was the weekend before last. I wasn't hungover or extensively drunk but they made the best food I've ever had at 5 am. My group had a bit of a time with the wait staff but I had no qualms.

I will be returning, hopeful at a more pleasant hour. Nice decor, reminds me of the cheesy touristy Vegas I grew up visiting, in a good way."}
{"text":"A Vegas trip means we can't leave without visiting the Peppermill. It wasn't that crowded when we arrived Saturday just about noon but there was still a good 20-minute wait. We figured we better wait in the Fireside Lounge. 

We ordered a round of drinks. About 10 minutes later, we heard a huge crash. Five minutes later, the cocktail waitress arrived with a tray of broken glasses and two intact drinks. Ah, my Bloody Mary! Unfortunately, they didn't make the other drinks in time before we left for our table. The waitress explained all the drinks spilled on tray and so she couldn't read what the others ordered. Still, things happened and we forgave her.

Meals are huge as always. I ordered the Southern Fried Steak which I barely ate half. I love their hash browns which seem like individual thin sliced potatoes. They give you way too many eggs but who cares. 

I just hope the rumors of them closing down are false."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Country fried steak and eggs was good nice gravy and crispy fried steak. Service was slow."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant for food .
I did not like  the hostess , who greets you at the door. . She seem very cold. 
The server  Wendy was good and friendly.
Over all still good place to eat."}
{"text":"Ok so I considered not leaving such a bad review because the food is really good here. It's kinda a hidden gem but that completely made this a bad experience is the service. From the start we waited what seemed like forever just to have our waiter, yes a waiter. Not waitress and I think this is where their downfall was. He didn't come over to say hi welcome or take an order until almost 20 minutes into us being seated. Red flag right there! We ordered and waited again. I don't know how long it was sitting at the counter before he picked it up but food was only mildly hot, so not fresh at all. He asked if we need anything I said yes we want some ranch and mayo. He wanted to stand there and tell me that I don't need it because they put mayo on it already. Hmmm I looked at him and told him again mayo and ranch yet again. He said ok and walked off. It took almost 10 minutes for that, ridiculous. Ok so we ate and like I said food is delicious and the portions are huge but just a heads up you do pay a lot to have big portions. Nothing under $10 in this diner. So we were ready to leave and our waiter was nowhere to be found and this went on for 30 minutes. No drink refill, no checking on customers, nothing! Finally he emerges from GOD knows where and we just ask for a box and our check. I was happy just to leave. It was such a poor experience this time I was very disappointed. Won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Wow, so many reviews hating on the atmosphere. I mean, if you love everything modern and shiny and new, then this definitely isn't your kind of place. Move along.

My husband loves everything retro. I came across the Fireside Lounge while researching places to go on our Vegas trip, and knew immediately that this would be right up his alley.

I was right. The velour couches, neon lights, and servers dressed in long gowns definitely made us feel like we were in a time warp. Well, except for the fact that bad 90s country music was playing. I mean, if you're going to go with a theme, you need to go all in!

Service was a little odd. We waited a few minutes for the server in our section to greet us. Then another woman came by and was like \"hey, so and so is supposed to be your server, but I may wind up being your server, so we'll see.\" Then after bringing our drinks, she said \"yeah so and so is supposed to be your server, but she's busy, so I'll be taking care of you.\" I mean, okay, I guess?

I ordered a Kiss Me Cucumber, which was delicious, but super weak alcohol-wise. Even after a second one, I felt nothing. My husband had two double jack and cokes and definitely felt it a bit. We also ordered sririacha chicken bites to snack on, which were pretty tasty - crispy and a little spicy.

When we were ready to go, it took forever to get our check. It was 1am on a Tuesday, so it wasn't very packed. Not sure why that took so long.

Overall, three stars. We'll come back next time we're in town and see if this changes."}
{"text":"The lounge was a little disappointing.  It had a sad 80's strip-club ambience.  It's supposed to be the #1 makeout spot in Vegas, but that's not the feeling I had there.  The tv's should've played something other than old bluegrass live performances."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. We bring our friends from out-of-state here all the time. It's like a blast from the past and feels like walking into the glory days of Las Vegas.

Drinks are top notch. My fav is the Bloody Mary.

Food is over-the-top delicious! Breakfast is my favorite. All of the dishes have been awesome so far. 
 
The staff friendly. The prices are good. And the ambiance can't be beat!"}
{"text":"My husband is a foodie we know great food.  This place was crowded and it's the food not just because it's on the strip and it's a vegas classic place to go, the food is really, really outstanding.  My husband ordered the Reuben with the marbled Rye this is his words...\"It was an experience that I did not want to end\". I had the Tangy Buffalo Wrap it was so good.  The onion rings are delicious as well.  The drinks are pricey but that is because your on the Strip.  3.25 is pricey for me but hey this place has the prices of Cheesecake Factory which is worth it because they give you a lot of food.  We are coming back to try the breakfast which we heard is excellent, all the hungover tourists and locals can't be wrong."}
{"text":"Oh snaaap. If you wanna feel like Sharon Stone in 'Casino' circa 1975, then put on that sparkly silver dress and get your ass to the Fireside Lounge. While so many places in Vegas are trying to go old school back to Sinatra in the 50s, Peppermill boldly stays in the 70's...tacky floral uniforms and all.

The restaurant part is okay, but lounge is where it's at. Sitting around the water/fire pit on those cheese plush couches makes you wonder why disco ever ended. ...well, other than the million obvious reasons, but the cheesy throwback amazingness of this place can't be beat."}
{"text":"YAAAAAAASSSSSS

I have tried to hit up Peppermill on my last TWO Vegas visits, but circumstances prevented a drop-in. Looks like third time's a charm, because I was finally able to step inside the glory that is Peppermill, and loved it so much that I came back the next morning for brunch part two.

Peppermill is like an 80s Club + Rainforest Cafe, so basically my two favorite things combined (not even really joking about that). Please take a moment to imagine neon pink and purple lights running along the ceiling, lush fake foliage abound, vibrant blue stained glass lamps overhanging each table, while you enjoy your morning booze and breakfast. No, seriously. IMAGINE.

Both mornings, we dropped in and put our names down before heading into the mysterious \"Fireside Lounge\" door. The 80s club vibe kicks up about 200 notches here, as you descend into a circular pit complete with rusted orange sofas, and outdated music videos on a tv that hovers above a circular pool and fire pit. It feels good for about 18 second before it's absolutely too hot to be down there, but you don't leave because it's just. too. cool. Start off by enjoying a cocktail in any variety (A sweet strawberry take on the mimosa? A ridiculous huge daquiri in a glass the size of a baby's head? Even coffee with baileys will do ya!), served by a young lady in a satin prom dress, before being whisked away to your dining experience.

Breakfast on both mornings was deelish. Morning A introduced me to the eggs benedict, while Morning B seemed fine for the chorizo. Both were extra tasty. On Morning B I asked if an iced coffee was a possibility, though it wasn't on the menu - the server happily accommodated by pouring coffee over ice into an ice cream sundae glass. I also love that coffee comes with options like vanilla creamer and RAINBOW SUGAR! 

Pretty much I wanna be here like 'erry day."}
{"text":"Good stuff but I am a local so I am a bit bias about my food and places.  I will not be back for food (dinner) it was good but I can get the same for cheaper in a local spot.  I think if you are a tourist it is totally worth it for the cool ambiance the lighting is sparkly  and fun, the restaurant is dimly lit anding to all the glittering lights and trees surrounding you.  Big oval booths add to the fun 70's 80's ish feel.  

I had a huge burger Ciabatta Pesto Burger Flame-broiled burger could taste the flame in the food.  Mozzarella cheese, fresh basil instead of lettuce a nice touch, red onions some were hard and not good so I had to pick them off, tomato, Prosciutto (prosciutto was old and hard had to pick that off as well) and pesto (lots almost to much pesto) sauce on a ciabatta the bun was awesome.  All burgers come with the choice of french fries, onion rings or potato salad (I had onion rings pretty awesome as far as onion rings go ;)

I do think however I would come back for some late night drinks in the bar area they are really cool looking and the setting, fire pits and appetizers are pretty good I hear!  That is why they are getting 3 stars instead of 2 because the ambiance and bar is I think the highlight of any locals trip!  I wish my food would have all been fresh and I wouldn't of had to pick so much off I would have liked to have added a star to my review."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Just a little overpriced for my pocket. We spent $50 for two people for ham and eggs and fountain drinks. But I guess that's to expect when your on the strip everything is over priced."}
{"text":"I have never been impressed with the food at the Peppermill, though its the kind of place that I end up at with friends now and then. It doesn't close and s sort of a Las Vegas late night staple. The service has always been prompt, both in the fireside lounge and in the diner area... but the food.. is just not that good? 

I recently had a buffalo chicken wrap that was pretty much overly laden with ranch dressing and not alot of meat, or 'buffalo' style spicy sauce. My friend had a spinach and feta omelet that was not only cold, but flavorless. How that was achieved with feta in the mix, I am unsure. Overall it was unsatisfactory, but we were hungry and tired and went with it. I didn't finish my wrap, I gave it to a buddy and he complained of the excess ranch and lack of everything else as well. 

$81 for 3-4 entrees, some hot coffee and tea, and alot of ranch,. I am not rushing back. The main thing I have ever ordered at the Peppermill in the past, was an Irish-Coffee with whipped cream from the bar in the Fireside Lounge. I will stick to that on any return visit from now on."}
{"text":"I love breakfast foods.
And it's not that hard to screw up.
And when you do screw up breakfast an angel loses its wings.

We stopped by Vegas, coming back from a roadtrip from Colorado to California, so you can imagine the exhaustion we all were feeling, hoping that a good meal would revitalize us.

This place had some high reviews and it's labeled \"American Traditional Breakfast\".

Once you step in the place it has that Vegas ambience with slot machines out in the front, then you actually walk into the restaurant and it's like a blast from the past, tacky 80s decor. Neon lights, dark dim lighting, tacky carpet, tacky lamps, everything is so tacky. It's not even a nostalgic, retro tacky. It's like that horrible decor your estranged aunt on your mother's side uses. Bleh.

Waitresses and busboys were generally polite, but also kinda ignored us... they were busy, wont hold it against them. Plus they have to wear these awful uniforms.

I ordered an omelet, I forget which one, but I remember it being HUGE and full of scallions. They could have chilled out on the scallions...
My cousin got the biscuits and gravey, and it wasn't anything special. Just two biscuits and a heaping pile of gravy. The portion was too big for such plain flavors.
My mom ordered the eggs benedict and her face of disappointment made me not even want to try it. She said it wasn't bad though, but my mom is usually too nice for her own good.
I also got orange juice and I never imagined being disappointed with orange juice... it had a weird flavor to it... like they added sugar to a fresh squeezed OJ. Why would you do that if that is what you did....

I left pretty angry and dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast and HUGE portions you get your moneys worth most definitely. Breakfast and dinner menu served all day which is good seeing as its Begas and who knows what time you will be eating or getting up for that matter. It does stay packed and its usually a lil wait especially for larger parties which is tp be expected we waited about 30 mins and thats with 5 of us and people waiting outside to be seated when we arrived. So it wasn't a bad wait at all, and to top it off they have a lounge/bar area you can wait in and grab a drink and check out the cool decor...its most definitely a 70's feel restaurant with the lounge having a cute lil old school drop seating area with a fire in the middle with velvet everywhere! It sounds tacky but trust me you will love it! Its very cute and has great ambiance! And the breakfast food is sooo good! And bonis they have a full bar also with good drinks and most of them are nixe sizes. You wont regret it!"}
{"text":"I have so many memories at this place. I've been coming to this place since I haven't been here since our was about 10 and at 30 I'm barely making my way back. The food is great and the drinks are strong! I had a Mai Tai and Marco Polo Ommulet and it more then satisfied me. This place is a must go if you visit the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"\"Old fashion Vegas must have!\" I'd  never been to Peppermill's and chose to attend this past summer. Now if your the basic down to earth type person, this we'll be a great stop filled with memories and laughter.The food is mostly American & the service is very humble. With all said, I'll be soon returning back to the \"Fireplace Lounge\""}
{"text":"Very \"Old Vegas\" feel in this place! But I was excited to go as I have lived in Vegas for quite some time and have never gone. I would definitely bring out of towners here!"}
{"text":"First visit and I loved it. 

The wife and I came in for breakfast on a Tuesday morning. The place was full, but they were able to find us a seat. We were greeted quickly by the hostess and asked if we wanted a drink from the bar. I did, so she sent over a cocktail waitress in a cocktail dress. 

We settled in and took in the decor. Because they were busy and I had a screwdriver in front of me, we didn't make any note of the time. My wife commented that the place looks like the back of Sammy Johns' 1973 Chevy van. Wonderfully kitschy.

Our waitress took our order and made great suggestions, because I had trouble deciding what I wanted. They were excellent suggestions. My wife had a pesto chicken sandwich on ciabatta bread. I ordered Munch's breakfast.

Both dishes were huge and easily could have been split between us. I dove into my plate, hash browns mixed with onions, mushrooms, peppers and linguica, topped with eggs. I enjoyed it so much that I never even asked for a bite of the sandwich. I know she enjoyed it because she kept nibbling on it even after the point of immobility. I fully understood, as I was at the same point picking out slices of linguica from my plate. 

I have already recommended the Peppermill to friends."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fingers, which were very GOOD! The waitress sucked ass but the food was awesome!. I would go back."}
{"text":"I have been making regular stops to Fireside Lounge for a while now and I really like it. The lighting and decor would do it for me alone.  Booths tucked behind fake plants. Fire coming out of water.  It feels kinda like being in a fish tank. A pink fish tank. 

They serve all manner of sweet, strong, and overly garnished cocktails. Tall ones, short ones, pink ones, and blue ones. Some of the drinks are the size of fish bowls.
Pink fish bowls.

The bartenders are in black and white and the cocktail waitresses are wearing evening wear. Drinking these crazy drinks in such an atmosphere can really have a good effect on the old disposition. If you know what I mean.

So I have visited the lounge a bunch and never so much as walked into the restaurant. So the last time I was in town it was time.  

The ambiance was the same as the lounge only a bit brighter and more restaurant like. Which might have something to do with the fact that it is indeed a restaurant.

The evening gown clad waitress came over and brought us mai tais and what not. The restaurant waitress was dressed interesting also, I think. All were nice.

The food was quite good and served in over sized portions. Pancakes, omelets, burgers and stuff like that. I personally had buffalo chicken wrap due to some reviews I have read. I would not normally order some such thing like that. It was really good. Everything everybody got was good. Big salads and other bullshit I don't remember. 

So two good things in one building. And it's on the strip, albeit the ass end of the strip. And for desert you can go across the street to the Riviera. Go get it."}
{"text":"Super sized helpings!  Try the Nachos Nachos Nachos with a few friends to be able to finish it!"}
{"text":"I went to the Peppermill on 4/4. I got married in Vegas on 4/6. My husband and I have always made a special trip to the Peppermill every time we're in Vegas, so naturally, we picked it as the location for our rehearsal dinner. I called to make reservations about 3 weeks in advance. I even wrote to them on their site to ask about the availability of a vegan meal for one of my guests. I never got an email or call back, by the way. 

When I called to make the reservation for 6 people, I confirmed with the manager about a vegan meal. I called back a week later to add 2 more people to my reservation, and change my time to 6PM. So it was confirmed, TWICE. When we got to the Peppermill, they had no reservations for us. The hostess said we would have to wait with everyone else and made no apologies for the mistake. She even said they do not accept reservations, even though it says they do on their site and I called and did so! I asked to speak with a manager. The manager had no explanation and was actually rude about it. Our party had to wait 30+ minutes to be seated, which defeated the purpose of me making reservations in the first place. Then, once we ordered, my meal and my husband's meal was served 20 minutes after everyone else in my party's meal. 

This was the worst experience I have ever had at the Peppermill. My reception dinner was ruined. I was so embarrassed by the poor service and the rudeness of the hostess and manager, especially after we told everyone what a great place this was. I can't see myself dining there again. I was so disappointed. I had other out-of-town wedding guests who asked about dining there. I warned them that the service isn't what it used to be. 

Peppermill, if you're reading this, please make your staff aware that in this economy, this is the best way to lose loyal customers, rudeness and poor service."}
{"text":"Came here again and I still love this place. This is where I come to be a fatass after a long night of drinking. 

Awesome service, never a long wait for a table or food, and food is awesome and portions is more then enough."}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant for over 20 years while staying at the old Stardust hotel. Best by far in Vegas. Breakfast fantastic.  Always busy but seems to move fast. I really love this place. Never had a bad meal, service great. Five star all the way!"}
{"text":"The waitress was nice and knowledgeable and attentive but the hostesses were rather engaged in themselves and personal conversation than the customers.  The food was mediocre at best. It definitely could use some seasonings and flavor. I had the chicken tenders and it was over fried and bland."}
{"text":"Amazing decor and people watching... a bit pricey- but everything is in Vegas!   100% worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm in utter disbelief that I haven't written about the Peppermill yet. I heard my first mention of this joint on an episode of \"CSI\" and I was interested. I saw my idol Tony Bourdain meander his way here and I was hooked. I took my first glance of the Peppermill's interior and I was obsessed. Am I a coke-fueled old school glam slam Vegas princess? ...Maybe. But I sure do love this place!

The food is generally hit or miss, but believe you me the portions are GIGANTIC. You should either probably split a selection with somebody else in your party or prepare for a ridic amount of leftovers. You have been warned.

My two favorite dishes here are the seafood omelette (Mediterranean I think it's called) and the Corned Beef Hash with basted eggs and all the fixins. Again, we aren't talking Michelin-star quality, but the ingredients are definitely fresh, plentiful, and made to your liking.

But the absolute best part of the Peppermill? C'mon... the entire joint is draped in mirrors, fake foliage, year-round multi-colored Christmas lights, neon trim lighting, and a dark carpeting fit for a fab downtown casino floor. The lounge itself -- which looks deceivingly large thanks in large part to those mirrors -- is a trip, and definitely one of my top ten Vegas landmarks in my heart.

That single fire pit is captivating, sexy, mysterious, and gaudy all at once -- and I promise one glance and a slippery lil drink between your fingers, and you'll fall truly madly deeply in love like I have. Everyone is also very sweet, and although some have mentioned the spotty service, I've experienced nothing but the utmost courtesy and efficiency.

Don't let the place fool you. Get in here, be prepared to eat, be especially prepared to fall head over heels for the Peppermill. My kinda Vegas."}
{"text":"Always delicious! Large portions and such a cool ambiance. This is one of my favorite eateries in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ended up here during Presidents Day weekend after Wing Lei on the strip unexpectedly (and rudely) changed their reservation policy at the last minute (more to follow on another posting).

Crazy, crazy busy with over an hour wait for two. Really lucked out though at the counter, and got seated immediately.  
Had no idea that this throw back, fun and lively place was this popular on the Strip!

Enjoyed my huge Belgian waffle, but overall, just IHOP-ish' type food in ginormous portions. Fellow diner next to me had an omelette that looked like it consisted of a dozen eggs. Doesn't everyone have a dozen or so eggs for breakfast?!? LOL."}
{"text":"Came here because everyone, and I mean everyone, suggested this place when I told them I was going to Vegas. Rightly so! 

We arrived on a Sunday around lunch time. We came at one of their busiest times, waited almost an hour for a table.

The food was delicious. Boyfriend got the country friend steak and I got the hashbrowns and eggs. The country gravy was to die for! And portions are huge! Loved that our meal came with the option of a blueberry muffin. I was so full, I couldn't eat it there so I took it to go and had it as a midnight snack back at my hotel. 

It's reasonably priced and the service is great! Even though the wait for a table can be long, the food came out quick. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Basic American style coffee shop. Perhaps my opinion is tainted a bit by the fact I viewed some things about food preparation which are not generally seen by most customers. Nevertheless the breakfast was good and in copious amounts. The wait staff worked very hard at delivering the various orders as expeditiously as possible."}
{"text":"The breakfast is Good and hits the spot after a long drive and a good hangover cure!! The earlier the better if you wait the line gets long as does the wait."}
{"text":"Many of the Yelpers had this one correct in the descriptions. Good portion sizes and the price was a littler high. 

The location made this place one of the few that we drove to. Parking was ample and the place was very busy inside. Even with a first day on the job waitress, everything went pretty well. Really want to give the extra star, but there really wasn't enough to justify it. Food was good and portions were on the large side, but If you are on a diet and tempted to over eat, don't go here. If you want an oversized Vegas sized meal, it will fit the bill. The quality was slightly above average and that is probably the best way to describe the four star review."}
{"text":"Went over for breakfast as got tired of paying $50 at the casino. Excellent job, great pirces, and huge portions. Staff very friendly and a nice menu for any time of the day. Kind of tacky inside with the pink neon strips, but perfect for what ails you. Great late night stop too if you're looking for some food after a long night."}
{"text":"What's up with these positive YELP reviews??? Visiting Las Vegas ... tried the peppermill and I felt I was eating a bucket of grease..... the steak over cooked.... I guess they don't know what medium well is..... so disappointed"}
{"text":"WHY oh WHY? cant I have a Peppermill in San Diego?! 

the 10 egg omelette was so huge I felt bad for all the starving people in the world! 
The portions are crazy big..even the coffee is served in a huge mug! THUMBS UP for french vanilla creamer!
 I think the first customer was the jolly green giant and they just never changed the portion sizes! 
The waiter was super cool and nice. I forgot his name..\"sorry cool dude\", but he was telling us jokes and gave us advice on ordering one meal for two. That was very nice of him because he was soooooo right! 
My husband decided to make up his own alcoholic beverage that didnt have a name so the bartender was nice enough to come to our table and treat him like VIP mixing his drink the way he wanted..so either she came because she was super nice like the waiter or she wanted to get a look at the weirdo (aka my husband) that didnt know the name of the drink he was thinking of! haha 
Anyway. We had a full family mixed with adults and kids and everybody was very nice to us. Got our food fast (I think about 9 of us total and our food was ready in about 20-25mins) We all were pleased and fat at the end of the visit. 

It was clean. great atmosphere. tasty food. good drinks.GREAT prices
We LOVED the fake trees inside and the confetti crystal sugar shaker that I....I mean somebody thought about stealing.

I think this is the only place we will eat next time!

Enjoyed my visit on 12/24/2010"}
{"text":"AHH, The Peppermill, Where one could find a cigaret butt in their pancakes and still eat it.
This is the spot when you are drunk AF leaving the 4am club. Sleezy Vegas but perhaps the BEST Breakfast on the strip. 
Open 24 Hours, The Food Good, The Environment Is lots of Laughs and Drunks. All in All This Is a True Liddo Vegas Gem."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Food came out quickly and we were seated right away. The waitress and bar maid were quick too"}
{"text":"Had lunch here early today... One of the best burgers I've had in a loooooooong time!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The best EVERYTHING! They give you so much food it's crazy, two people can eat from one meal. The staff there is wonderful, the scene is relaxing and comfortable. 5"}
{"text":"Great food excellent service, if you have not gone that should be on your bucket list of places to eat In Vegas. French toast college was excellent. I will be coming as many times possible since I live in vegas. The lounge itself is a place to be as well. Free parking is a plus since just about everything on the strip has a cost for parking. Yes"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great old school vibe with good food to boot. We came here twice for breakfast during our stay in Vegas and would gladly return again. The customer service was friendly and attentive,  and the food was tasty. The portions are large, so bring an appetite or prepare to share.  

Ask for the muffins grilled with butter- it will make your day!"}
{"text":"Typical American dinner; we came in at 11:30am and still had to wait an hour plus to be seated. The food was good; not great but good. As everyone notes large portions are a theme here. Service was good, friendly and prompt 

I would come again...need to try and pancakes and French toast still :)"}
{"text":"I really can't say much about this place (cuz I don't remember it that clearly), but I like what I remembered. Went there with a group of friends after a night out on the town. Showed up at around 5 am and a friend and I split some kind of nachos that were pretty good. Of course we weren't expecting mexican food and what we got was not very mexican, but at least it was what we expected. Another friend got a denver omelette and said it was the bomb. The waitress was very nice (read she didn't press sexual harassment charges against any of my friends) and had a good sense of humor. It's nice that they're open when you need them. Other than that, I really can't comment on the price or even the ambiance."}
{"text":"Is this the best diner ever? It really is. I was there last year and the wait was about 3 hours. I was glad there was no wait this year because driving for 4 hours, I just wanna eat. Their sugar is awesome (colorful and pretty). Their prices are more than affordable and there portions are more than fair. Most are shareable. I got a breakfast combo plate and everything was superb. I shared with my sister and it was about $13 for the plate. We were extremely full after and didn't eat for the rest of the day. Awesome customer service and they are lenient with substituting sides for no extra charge. It's right next to Riviera hotel."}
{"text":"Having a vacation home in Las Vegas, the only reason we visit the strip is for dining options. One of our main stays for late night and breakfast has been the Peppermill for years. The place is always busy, normally a fun crowd and the food is always pretty good. Last night at midnight, we finally got around to dinner and headed here. I tried the Chicken Parmesan, and it was tasty. Wifey had the Chorizo and Eggs...always good here."}
{"text":"So we were spending a weekend in Vegas and a buddy mentioned he wanted to check out this spot. I had seen this spot featured on a random network showcasing the restaurant. I agreed we should try this spot so I didn't eat much all day so I could indulge a bit with a breakfast at 2am. As we showed at 2am, a little tipsy I may add, we all head to the RR to wash up I ask if I should put our name down for a table? My buddy looked at me a little confused and replied,\" They have a f'n restaurant? Were here for the lounge.\" To this my reply was,\" They have a f'n lounge? I was here for the food.\" Turns out we caught to different shows featuring to different sides of this joint.

As we enter the lounge we were set back by the décor that seem not to have been updated from the mid 80's, but it worked. The environment had a certain level of comfort that you don't get in a big hotel lounge. Great group seating, this spot even had a fire pit indoors. None of the music was dated I say past 87' but as I said it worked. A mix of locals getting off work and tourist coming and going we ended up drinking and eating for about another 3-4hrs. Our waitress was beautiful to the point we were willing to take each out to spend sometime with her, it was great. 

This is definitely the spot to hit if you want away from the Vegas norm."}
{"text":"We came just for dessert... on new years day morning around 6am.

We had the hot fudge sundae, and a milkshake. The milkshake was horrible.. it was really cheap.. like from McDonalds.  I wouldn't get that again.

The sundae, though, was real good. It was in a huge cup with hot fudge covering the whole thing, although the layer was thin, the quality of the fudge was pretty decent.  

The ambiance of this place is nice.. I can't remember anything else much like it.  For a 24hr diner, this is a decent choice.  The prices aren't that cheap for being outside of a casino, but it's still on the strip.

The servers were VERY friendly as well.

I would only recommend this place for late night because there are better choices during more normal hours."}
{"text":"Do not go to Denny's or any other chained Diner while in Vegas. You will get better tasting food for similar price RIGHT HERE! It was really night on our first night in Vegas and most places are closed in our hotel except for hotdogs, burgers, sandwiches, etc. We wanted something more, but not pay the Resort price of our food, so we walked over to this lovely little gem. First, let me just advise you that the colorful crystals on the table is sugar. My sister kept staring at the jar in amazement and my other sister and I couldn't stop laughing at her. Anyways, onto our dinners. We all ordered breakfast. My sister had the omelet, and let me tell you, it was GINORMOUS! A normal omelet probably has about 3 eggs, this one probably had a dozen eggs. It was SO LARGE that she probably laid an egg herself later on. I got the typical eggs, bacon and muffin meal as I wasn't as hungry. It was decent and filling, and usually I never regret getting bacon, but I did. My parents had the sausage and it tasted like it was smoked in apple wood. It was so good!! This establishment is a must if you want better than Denny's but not pay the price of the casinos."}
{"text":"The moment we walked in we had problems, very very slow service, literally had three serves for some reason. Idk. Menu is misleading, overall subpar"}
{"text":"Peppermill is definitely eye catching alone with the rainbow colored signs, but the neon does not end with the signs. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by more neon and mirrors! If neon and mirrors is your thing, then you'll feel right at home!

I have to admit that the combination of neon and the crowds of people on the strip really does draw attention to itself. The lounge atmosphere in the Fireside Lounge is amazing. It is a very relaxing place and not too loud so that you can carry on a conversation. Whether you're going for cocktails in the lounge or looking for a decent coffee shop in Vegas - you won't be disappointed. The giant omelettes are what the Peppermill are most famous for. As far as the service goes - absolutely lovely! 

Any visit to Las Vegas should include a visit to Peppermill!"}
{"text":"came here with another couple... had to wait 45 mins for breakfast, which is fine... means the food is good, which it was. only problem here is you will most likely have a drink while you wait...... DONT !!! super weak drinks here folks."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the Peppermill...ANYTIME I go to Vegas, HAVE to go their for breakfast!!! The portions are HUGE, the place is SUPER clean, ALWAYS crowded and the waitress's have all been working there 8 yrs or longer...Good to see that they are good at their job and they like what they do!
Food is excellent....staff is wonderful..no need to say more, just GO EAT THERE!"}
{"text":"i spent nearly 13 dollars on a teeny tiny wimpy shrimp cocktail. the drinks in the lounge were over priced and the bartender had an attitude. the decor is from the 70's and unappealing. i dont see what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Here's the deal, if you partying in Vegas and need to take it a notch down for a bit.  Get to the pepper mill and kick back and chill.  This place is cool and the drinks and atmosphere really gets you into just relaxing and listen to some old school."}
{"text":"In town for a birthday, our uber driver recommended this spot to my group. We originally came out yesterday, but the establishment was closed due to a gas leak. We thought we'd give it another try and came out on Fathers Day.
The wait was an hr, but w/e. We went to the lounge side which is pretty cool looking to enjoy some drinks while we waited. This place definitely isnt the place if you have any eating restrictions. If ur vegan ur only gettin a salad and some fries out of this place. I had french toast, it was ok, nothing spectacular. My family had omelets, which were huge they couldnt finish them. The best part was the mimosa. This place is just a fancied (aesthetic wise) up american diner."}
{"text":"This place is great! Stopped here for brunch, and although there was a 35 minute wait, the experience was worth it. Great food, great service and good prices :) I would recommend this place for anyone visiting sin city!! #nomnomnom"}
{"text":"Awesome huge portions, great American food and such a cool special diner. The burgers were tasty and best fries I've had in a while. The portions are so big it makes me wonder if there is a grocery store attached to this place. Complimentary photo taken of your dinner party. Very very reasonable prices, not vegas-ey prices."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is by far the best place to eat breakfast in all of Nevada. The portions are very genrous and the food is outstanding. The fireside lounge is a wonderful place to relax and have a drink while waiting for a table. The atmosphere in the lounge has to be experienced to fully grasp just how wonderful it is. Overall, no trip to Vegas is complete without breakfast at the Peppermill"}
{"text":"ummm this is just like an IHOP. if you have friends or family in town-- don't bring them here. the lights are cool inside... it's only a decent place to go when you have the munchies late at night. food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Coffee shop with nightclub-like atmosphere. Most romantic bar in town. Always crowded, never had a bad meal there yet."}
{"text":"They give you a nice portion of food. I had the chicken fried steak which was excellent. My husband had the Marco omelet, he said was good, and my son had a ham and cheese omelet, which he enjoyed. The service was ok, not the most attentive, but would I go back again yes! affordable, plentiful, and good tasting... works for us!!

Would give 4 stars  but giving it 3 due to having to ask random staff for items, as lacked quality service from hostess."}
{"text":"Iconic Vegas at its best.  The interior is so cool, with faux trees, and recessed led mood lighting all over.  This place is open 24 hours and is a must visit for people in Vegas for the first time!  Get an omelet, they are hugeeeeee!"}
{"text":"All I can say is your wildest dream of every food!! Young old rich poor, this is it for food!! 24/7.  The food is prepared the way it's suppose to be done. I am a foodie and this is it!!!!  Wow! Wow!Wow!! Oh, there's a bar attacked that serve the best drinks in town. See Denise for some real drinks. Well, James did a great job when she wasn't here. Hint: sbe trained him! Ha!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is atrocious here. Skip it. I couldn't stomach my biscuits and gravy. It's a very bad sign for me when a breakfast spot can't get a basic dish like that down right. Service was good though, hence the two star instead of one."}
{"text":"So Im pretty convinced that our waitress at the Peppermill was the stripper from the night before who put lit matches in her nipple ring holes for my friends birthday \"cake\".  

The Peppermill is where everyone goes for bloody mary's in the \"morning\" (after check out) on the way home from Vegas. We had a big group of people and they were able to seat us together without much of a long wait. This place was packed, but not ridiculous so it was humming. There is a seperate wait person for every thing: coffee guy, booze lady,  food lady and so on which can make for a confusing time since its no ones job to get the coffee, except that one guy but he's in the back making crack for the rest of the wait staff (they are ALL so hyper). 

Any who- the decor was alright, kinda cheesy blue neon lights and stuff. The food was decent, the coffee was hot and strong and I even tried the bloody mary (i hate them normally) and it was pretty dang fabulous.

All and all I wouldn't be completely opposed to coming here again."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive; the service was friendly and efficient(hence 2 stars), but they had to wear hideous faux aloha matching shirts and shorts. The decor is so bad it's bad; a nightmare of plastic plants covering every available surface lit by dim but still remarkably gaudy neon. Imagine if Big lots sold a furniture line they called Gothic rainbow. Now imagine you're looking at it through purple shades and that's what the place looks like in daylight. They also have Tiffany style lamps with flamingos on them - someone should go to jail for that. Did I mention the ceiling is covered in black mirror tiles? 
The large portions are no compensation for the underwhelming quality of the ingredients. Sour 1980s Gas station coffee, flavourless vegetables, and the cheese in my omelet resembled a generic version of a Kraft cheese slice."}
{"text":"Not quite sure why this restaurant has so many stars.  It was just okay, nothing special...typical bar food.  I went with the chicken quesadilla and the hubby went with the turkey burger.  They were both alright.  I can't really complain, but I can't say I'd go back either.  Good place to stop if you're starving and you enjoy the old school Vegas vibe."}
{"text":"First and Foremost : Unexpectedly large portions. Especially for the price. 

Also, from what I have seen, the bloody marys are huge too. Love the mirrors and cherry tree decor. The staff is humorous and the atmosphere is generally good.

Looks like a great place for a \"recovery\" breakfast"}
{"text":"We had our first visit to Peppermill on 2/7/14. Good service and good food. I ordered the country ham breakfast and hubby had an omelette. Both were excellent but way too much. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"great place
fun atmosphere
love the neon look it has the retro vegas look
the fireside lounge is amazing
the amount of food is definitely worth the price
I'd say come here late night cuz during dinner time it gets packed and some of the food tends to be under the heat stand too long to where fries may get cold"}
{"text":"Perfect vegas cheese.... but great food and service to accompany it.  On any given vist you'll see people there that belong in magazines or that have three teeth from all the meth they smoke... Equal service to all and friendly and safe place to get a some good solid timely grub at a low cost by anyone's standards."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! Ate here two days in a row and both days were fantastic! The second day we actually saw the trapeze guy from zumanity! The food was fantastic! It is hard to find places that have pescetarian breakfasts! The pancakes were mouthwatering, hash browns were cooked perfectly, fries were delicious through every bite. My hubbies burger was wonderful, he ate the entire thing and never complained. I love that they serve the entire menu all day! Will definitely go back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"I love the Peppermill! Best Rueben sandwich in Vegas - and I don't even like sauerkraut. It is two different experiences in one. The restaurant is like visiting a dark Denny's on acid, but with much better food. After you're full, you need to check out the Fireside lounge in the back. Cozy up on a red velvet couch and wait for a stripper to come sit on your lap, although if a girl does sit on your lap, it's probably not a stripper since the place only looks and feels like a boobie bar, but really isn't. I always make at least one late night trip to the Peppermill whenever in Vegas for grub and a cocktail or two..."}
{"text":"I can't go to Vegas without visiting The Fireside. Delicious drinks(my favorite is the dreamsicle martini), awesome vintage ambiance, and good service. It's a great Vegas must do."}
{"text":"Hazel Q said it all in her review!

It's a must for us dive bar and Old Vegas nostalgia fans. 

We got a great booth near the firepit and were engulfed by the pink fluourescent lightiing and fake floral vines snaking in and out of the walls and ceiling. it's awesome. 

Our main goal was to drink and drink, but we managed to try the appetizer sampler platter and the sliders which were decent for bar food. 

Our waitress was really cool and always attentive to us - what more could you ask for :) It was an all around good time for us to talk, catch up, and oh yeah, get all too tipsy."}
{"text":"Huge portions but so worth the price! The food is so good we ate there 3 times! I suggest you share instead of ordering your own  that's just how much food you get! I will eat here everytime I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"The portions in this place are huge.  My wife got the Mediterranean omelet. It was big, looked like it was made with 8 eggs. The filling was just okay and so was the sun dried tomato sauce. The hashbrowns were great, crispy and seasoned well. 

I ordered the sausage scramble on top of hashbrowns with a cheese sauce.  The cheese sauce was fake and had an off color but actually tasted good with the eggs and hashbrowns.  The sausage and the ingredients in the scramble were really good. 

I would eat here again. Decent food for a diner."}
{"text":"I remember going to the Peppermill in Santa Clara, Ca (no longer there), and remember how wonderful the retro lounge experience was. So I knew I had to hit up the Peppermill Las Vegas, and I was not disappointed. It's one of the few places to give you a feel for what old Vegas was like. The food is American diner style breakfast, lunch, and dinner 24/7 with great portions at great prices.  This is a great resource, when your tired of being gouged at the Hotel/Casino."}
{"text":"Kitschy Vegas all the way!  This places screams good times and scandalous fireside hook-ups in the lounge.  No, no, not for me, but I can see it happenin' for you single, lusty Vegas guys and gals.  

I just returned from my very first Vega-licious adventure and it wouldn't have been the same without a stop at The Peppermill.  I, along with my two fabulous female friends, had a blast here.  Shared a scorpion bowl, snapped some hilarious photos and relaxed by the firepit/fountain/pool thingy.  Cozy seating, fabulous waitresses in Halstonesque long black gowns, and tons of Vegas cheese!  Loved it.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you crave an old school Vegas vibe, this is your place. The Peppermill Lounge is a LV institution, and has been for over 30 years. Used as a backdrop for movies and TV shows about Vegas, past and present, every time you go in, you'd swear you were back in Vegas, circa 1972.

 Dark, with cool, deeply sectioned off booth/tables, HUGE, great,  girly cocktails with 2 foot straws, cool music, neon backdrops, friendly waitresses with big boobs and even bigger hair, huge, freshly prepared apps that taste phenomenal, especially at 2 am, the Peppermill has it all. It's the ultimate cool, nightlife vibe sans the crazy Strip Tourists and the annoying energy that they always bring. You know, the energy  that screams... \"I'm 21.. in town for the weekend from Cali , and I'm going to Pure!.\"  You get the drift. 

This is a place that locals haunt.  And if you are an out of towner and just happen to be here, then that's probably because some kind hearted  local took pity on you and told you about it. 
So enjoy. Just don't tell any other tourists about it. We thank you."}
{"text":"There is no place else to go for breakfast in Vegas, I don't care how many nights I'm there!

For those of you who haven't been, it's worth it, but figure a good $22 per person after coffee and juice."}
{"text":"Never a dissapointment at this Vegas spot. Mostly known by the locals and have been here only for breakfast / brunch a few times. Food is above par, diner type. Waitresses are fantastic, personale and attentive. Always a fun, good eating time at this kitschy, throw back type of spot."}
{"text":"Do you ever want to eat breakfast in a place that looks kind of like a strip club but is not a strip club?  No?  Well if you like good food, you should eat here anyways.  Great food at a reasonable price.

Went here with one of my buddies after night one of Vegas.  We knew that going to something at the Grand would be expensive and probably not very good, so we asked the door guys for the best restaurant in the neighborhood.  They both agreed the Peppermill was the spot.  It's also close to many places on the strip, a ~5 dollar uber ride or 10 dollar cab ride for us.  

While we were on our way, I was anticipating this quaint little diner, maybe some knick knacks on the walls, etc.  Well, I was mistaken to say the least.  Going in here, everything is neon and mirrors.  That being said, it was 7 in the morning (we were on Florida time still) and the place had plenty of people, so it was a good bet this place was legit.

The menu itself is impressive.  So many different varieties of breakfast food.  I got the French Toast Ambrosia, which is just, enormous.  Whoever can eat this in one sitting is clearly contributing to the national health care crisis.  The french toast was very good, not too heavy.  However, it is laden with whipped cream and about 5 different kinds of fruit, so it will fill you up.  The half a liter of syrup I added to it may have contributed to its density as well.  The fruit is good and fresh.  It's not mind blowing, but this is a LOT of food for a great price and, if you're staying at a hotel or something, you can bring back leftovers and have several breakfasts or share with friends.

If you're in the area, bring your sunglasses and come down here to grab a bite.  It's a great way to escape the hotels and have some good food in a more local-type Vegas atmosphere."}
{"text":"After a bad experience at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas we were in no mood to give them any more of our cash for breakfast. I remembered going to tithe Peppermill in the late 80's early 90's but hadn't been back. Was happy to find it still there in all its kitschy glory, now retro cool! The service and food are all still incredible and the portions are enormous! My friend ordered a short stack of pancakes and he could barely eat one of the three! Great place!"}
{"text":"Peppermill is an iconic, \"upscale\" diner and cocktail lounge with a fun atmosphere. We went because we're fans of the movie SHOWGIRLS and a scene was shot here. Good burgers and cocktails -- weird combo, I know, but it was what we were in the mood for! It's in a slightly sketchy area of The Strip, but the joint itself is cool."}
{"text":"The food here is actually pretty good. We sat in the fireside lounge where a dress code is enforced so make sure you dress to impress. The seating great for large groups or a more intimate setting. I love the fireputs for when it's a bit more chilly ouside even though everything is inside. It just makes it all nice and toasty for you. The wait staff is quite over worked and their attitude shows it. Our server could have been a bit more friendly had she not worked three 10 hour shifts three days in a row. Management needs to give these girls a break for goodness sake! Nevertheless, I love the nolstagic feeling of this place and will be back as I love visiting this establishment for old times sake."}
{"text":"When you've got the late night munchies and can't figure out where else to go... The Peppermill is open 24 hours. 

The location is a bit tricky and although it's right by Wynn, you'll need a taxi. 

It's a fun atmosphere with an old Vegas feel.

I like that when looking at the menu, I'm reminded a bit of home with the typical diner menu choices as opposed to all of the fancy restaurant menus on the strip.

We had a sampler appetizer of some sort that came with fried shrimp, onion rings and mozzerella sticks. Everything was pretty good.

For my entree, I ordered the Ruben, which was huge and overflowing with fries. Just as everyone says, the portions are large. The Ruben was good. The Cheesesteak was also really good.

Also had the Brownie Sundae which was yum and the Coffee was great. 

Really sweet and attentive waitress. 

I had an overall good experience with this place. Good food, good portions, good prices and good service. I don't know if I'd really go out of the way to go to this place though. The food is just average. If it was in my hometown, it'd be nothing special."}
{"text":"Good large breakfast you can share at a great price. Has a nice lounge to wait in where you can order drinks while you wait...better than the hotel breakfasts. Def recommend and would go back."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't even know this place existed...I thought it was just a beat up old casino. But when I walked in, it was literally just a restaurant with a really small waiting area and a bar in the back. We came for brunch on a Sunday and it was packed...we waited around 30 minutes for our seats. 

Right when we sat down, a cocktail waitress came by and asked us if we wanted any drinks from the bar. And when you look around you, everyone's ordering cocktails or a drink from the bar. I'm guessing that's how they make their money. 

The décor is definitely something else...super retro. With purple and blue and pink colored booths and table. After we got seated, our waiter didn't come by until 10 mins later. We got a crab cakes as an appetizer. I ordered the Joe's San Francisco Special and my boyfriend ordered the Pancakes with bacon and eggs. 

My dish was definitely huge. It had scrambled eggs, spinach, sausages, onions, and a type of sauce. It was placed on top of a layer of hash browns. I think the dish was definitely overwhelming. Because everything just looked like a big blob of mess, I got full after eating 1/4th of the dish. The hash browns were definitely crispy and good! But the scrambled eggs and everything in it was too mushed together. I wish it was made separately rather than throwing it all in together. ($13)

My boyfriend's dish was good! The pancakes were a bit too crumbly. But other than that, the bacon and eggs were good! Like a regular breakfast plate. ($13)

The crab cakes were ok. Nothing too special. It came with a spicy mayo sauce. The display wasn't very nice. Looked like they just threw on a lettuce and put the crab cakes on and sprinkled it with some green onions. Not worth! ($9)

All in All, this place is ok. Its like a bit fancier than the Denny's right next door. And definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ahh step back in time a bit to the way the Peppermill Coffee Shop in Reno, NV used to be and other Peppermill restaurants (al la Santa Clara, CA) that have long since disappeared used to be. 
They still have the multi-colored sugar on the tables! This was one of the most memorable touches that I recalled from Peppermill form years back and was happy to see it still alive at the Peppermill VEGA$.
IF you hunger and looking for bold and hearty portions, this is the place for you! I ordered the Red Pepper Pasta - whoo... spicy hot and so flavorful! I couldn't even finish it, it was so much. Prices were a bit steep, but considering you can easily get two meals from one portion, I say great deal. 
Service was good, nothing exceptional in fact it did take some time for our servicer to greet us at the table but once she did, it was good thereafter. I think because the Friday night we went they were extremely busy, the staff were all buzzing around like bees, even the cocktail waitresses in their evening gowns ;-)"}
{"text":"Large portions. Easy Parking. Great place to meet up after hours for breakfast. The bar with the bubbling fire pit is a great place to relax."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of hollandaise in general, so I had doubts about trying the an omelet with sundried tomato hollandaise sauce. 
But it was the best ever"}
{"text":"Old school Vegas charm - which means cocktail waitresses, vinyl and velour, dim lighting, and Frank Sinatra sightings.  It is in some ways out of a movie.  With so many reviews, there is not much I can add, except that the stars are more for the AMBIANCE AND EXPERIENCE than for the food.  I had the Chicken Parm - double heaping helpings of breaded chix, basic pasta, and passable marinara.  Overall, this is middling Italian-American fare with BREAKFAST OPTIONS and many HANGOVER CURES at GOOD PRICES.  

CUT TO THE CHASE:  On my last two visits to Vegas, I did not make it a point to go back.  But I did not deliberately avoid it either.  It's just not my thing."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night, was very busy we waited 40min to be seated only to find out our table was given to another party. After begging seated our order was taken but we were never asked what we wanted to drink therefore we never had any drinks brought out... We waited for our food a very lonnnnnnggggg time! Our plates were brought out one by one. And two of the orders we never brought out. The manager eventually came out and apologized but I will not return. The food was cold and under cooked. I have to say this is my first bad review:("}
{"text":"Went at about 2am with a friend. Ordered the San Francisco something or other and the crab cake Bene. Wish I could say it was good but it was not. Woke up with major stomach pains ): our server Carolynn was sweet. I loved the decor. For a short while I forgot I was in Vegas.. A nice break from reality. Won't go back though, prices are too much for average food and we were HUNGRY. Eggs and crab don't mix and the poached eggs were not cooked right. Too bad."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this old school place for a long time now and since it was my birthday week I made sure we came in for breakfast. The atmosphere is old school Vegas, the place is huge, they have a separate lounge, and slot machines. The biscuits and gravy were amazing, the crabcake benedicts was also good, but they fell short on the hash browns. My strawberry mimosa was good and strong. Service was good, and you get a complimentary photo of your party, of course you can purchase additional if desired. I will return to try their dinner options."}
{"text":"I think my anticipation level had reached it's apex as I pulled up to entrance. After all, the stream of gushing, effusive Yelp reviews certainly did a lot to get me excited. I was expecting to enter a world straight outta \"Boogie Nights\" or something, but what I got was a decor that looked decidely more \"Scarface\" than \"Casino\". The tacky blue neon lighting and faux foliage made me feel like I was stuck in the 80's. I kept expecting our waitress to bring out a complimentary mountain of \"booga suga\" just to get the feast off to a rockin' start. 

The food here was adequate in quality and price. I got the chicken foccacia sandwich with fruit salad. The sandwich was a heavy meal, due in no small part to the bread, so I opted to ditch the carbs and mow down on the avocado and breast a la carte. The fruit \"salad\" was just a bowl of honeydew and cantaloupe and one single grape. Maybe I'm wrong, but a salad, to me, consists of a multitude of various fruits and such. That's like saying a lettuce and croutons is a salad. Not to me it ain't.

I think my party and I should have headed into the lounge after our meal, since that seems to be all the rage. I'm not sure why we didn't. Perhaps we were clouded in our thinking after such a filling meal. Alcohol is pointless on such a full stomach; it does nothing but further my bloat. Still, this was a blast from the past and well worth our time to check out."}
{"text":"Why do people like to go here? Maybe because they like Denny's and this is a better version that. The decor here has that 80's, dark, neon lights stuff - looks just like the inside of the limo that we were traveling in the night before. Good size portions are served, but the food were just whatever. I had the Ciabatta Pesto Burger and my friends all had various burgers and breakfast entrees and nothing stood out in terms of flavoring. Not worth the low double digit price tags for each. Guess the good thing is that they are open 24. For about the same price, Hash House A Go Go is a way better choice for even ridiculously huger portions and yummier tasting food with more of a distinctiveness."}
{"text":"What a great place this is...we had to wait about 30 minutes to grab a table and I understand that that's pretty normal. It's basically a large 1970's diner decorated in a \"disco Vegas\" style. 

The menu is large, but many opt for the 24 hour breakfast. I ordered something called the San Jose breakfast bowl, though trough would be more appropriate, it is large and heavy and contains scrambled eggs, sausage, beef, onions, spinach, cheese served over hash browns. It was very tasty, especially the potatoes...I could only finish about 1/3 of it and was not hungry again all day. Interesting staff and nice melange of customers for people watching."}
{"text":"No good. Large portions do not make up for the lack of quality. Corned beef hash tastes like it's from a can. Mediterranean omelet was tasteless. Waffle batter is from a box. Not impressed. If you're a foodie, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Good food.  Great service.   Affordable prices. For sure, I'll be back for another food..."}
{"text":"I loved it here! I went for my birthday weekend and was pleasantly surprised that they took complimentary photos of your group. That was a nice memory to take along with me. 

The atmosphere was cool. Very vintage! Especially the fireside! Great for pictures. 

For a party of 7, we were quickly seated. The waitresses were pleasant and our food was brought out promptly. Nothing super spectacular about the food but it was decent. And the portions were HUGE. You definitely get your monies worth. And the prices were dirt cheap might I add. I couldn't even attempt to eat all of my food. 

I ordered a Scorpion cocktail as well. It was huge! You could definitely share it with 2 people. And the biggest perk is that you can take it with you to go if you don't finish it all in the restaurant.

I would definitely visit again! Even if its just for the atmosphere and to put something quick on my tummy."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm in Vegas I just have to go to the Peppermill.  It's one of those novelty places that never gets old with me.

I feel bad for the waitresses and them having to wear the outfits they're forced to wear but when you see the rest of the place you'll understand that it all fits.  

There are more mirrors and neon lights INSIDE this place than in probably all of the rest of Vegas combined.  It's fairly quiet so you can usually get a decent booth.  

Be warned that the portions are ridiculously large.  That goes especially for their desert sundaes which I never understand why I order because I never finish the entire thing.  

It's not overly priced in my opinion but the location is sort of a bit difficult to make if you're not driving since it's halfway between the strip and the old downtown with not much else around it."}
{"text":"I've traveled all around this fine country in search of the best bar nachos, and I found them here. It seems a little pricey, but when you see how much you get, it's a bargain. It takes a while to cook because they stack it in layers with enough cheese to choke a camel. It was the first time in my life I couldn't finish a nacho platter from a bar or restaurant.

Respect."}
{"text":"We call this place \"Schwanky Denny's,\" because you can order just about anything from Peppermill and it will come out fantastic. The portions are huge - each dish is good for two people. 

The first must-order is the Red Pepper Chicken Pasta. I know you're at a diner, but this is something you just can't get at an Italian joint. You'll see what I mean when you order it. 

Next, I suggest the chicken-fried steak. It's probably the least healthy thing you will order on the menu, but you can feel better about yourself when you see the broccoli and cauliflower on the plate. 

If you need a third dish, I suggest the sampler platter or anything with hash browns. Just don't order the Joe's San Francisco Special - our server recommended it and she has bad taste."}
{"text":"50s style diner with comfort food 24/7. Thankfully they have turkey sausage and oatmeal for the more health conscious. Prepare to wait. Don't leave w/o seeing fire pit TV and lowered lounge. Classic Vegas."}
{"text":"How this place has such good reviews is beyond me. Where to begin? 

The hollandaise on the eggs benedict tasted more like chicken soup than hollandaise sauce. The pancakes, which are comically large, are so sugary and mushy, adding even a little maple syrup nearly threw me in a diabetic coma (I'm not diabetic, either). 

And the place smells SO BAD. Obviously built sometime in the 70s, the owners opted for carpet. Carpet in a restaurant is always a terrible, terrible idea, as it soaks up everything, for all of time. 

I absolutely do not recommend Peppermill."}
{"text":"One of the oldest landmarks on the strip. This restaurant was in a bunch of movies like Casino. I ordered biscuits and Gray delicious the portions are big enough for two .. great spot"}
{"text":"big portions. good for sharing. my corned beef hash wasnt that good - but other food ordered were ok.  it also said vegetarian friendly but there wasnt really that much options for a strict vegetarian in our party. also open 24 hours so its great for after shows/late dinner options...."}
{"text":"Some locals took us here for some late night/early nachos and it was fantastic! Large portions and bean dips was the topping on the cake."}
{"text":"Ain't what they used to be. While living in San Jose several of my colleagues and I would go to the Peppermill on Friday's for the clam chowder and a sandwich. Today, while passing through Las Vegas we stopped at the Peppermill on the Strip. It was quite noisy and the food did not live up to what I remember. OK, but not great. Fast service."}
{"text":"reliably good food. nice portions for the price."}
{"text":"I came in around 1am on Saturday night for lounge.  Only ordered one drink, a mudslide and it was DELICIOUS.  However the lounge vibe felt kinda dead despite it being about 75% full.  Everyone was just sitting down without any mingling or activities among each other.  So after I finished my drink I seen no point in hanging around and left."}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews on Yelp and wanting a good chuckle, I was determined to eat at the Peppermill. After a L-O-N-G night of drinking and a bottle of whiskey later, we decided that the Peppermill was a good place to cure the hangover before we hit the road to go home. The food was just alright. I had the beef dip sandwich and fries. The man had the pancake special. Holly be-jezus...the pancakes were HUGE! I do have to give a shout out to our waiter although I didn't catch his name. He was super attentive and on his A-Game. Kudos. The decor is a throwback of the 70's, which is super cheezy but like I said, good for a laugh. Would I eat here again? Maybe...especially to soak up all the liquor from the night before."}
{"text":"Giant portions, and that's about it.

Breakfast was very busy.  They \"herd\" you to the lounge to wait for your table and with the hopes you'll buy drinks.   Service in the lounge was practically non-existent from what I could tell.

The menu is very extensive and has some nice breakfast creations on it.   They warn you about the portion size and how an omelet is made with like 10 eggs or something.

I got a \"garbage-can special\" type of dish that had eggs, sausage, ground beef, spinach, onions, hash-browns and a cheese sauce.  It came out in a bowl and while not looking very large, teased me into only finishing half of it.    My wife had French Toast Ambrosia (with fruit and stuff) which she loved.

Service was very slow.  Requests for things such as tabasco were forgotten (luckily the table next to us had some which they shared).

I'm sure it's a great hangover joint - just try to catch them during off-hours."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food. We always make sure to stop in when in Vegas. Its always full so be prepared but they usually seat you pretty quickly. Had the steak and eggs, it was delucious! The coffee is also very good. Portions ate huge so sharing is a good idea. Prices are a little high but you do get a lot of food and might only need to order one plate for two people anyway. They also provide a complimentary picture of your party. They do offer larger pictures in a Las Vegas themed frame for about $20-$25 but are not pushy."}
{"text":"First time here. The atmosphere was great. The staff there is very attentive and helpful. Service was wonderful, they have lots of menu items to choose from, lots of drinks and happy hour specials. The food tased great came out hot and fresh. Drinks are a little pricey when your not there on happy hour but it is the strip and things are more expensive. There is a 21+ bar also in the back that looked pretty cool to hang out in. They had fireside seating, standard seating and bar seating. The staff in the bar are was very nice as well."}
{"text":"WOO-HOO, what a place.  I felt like I was on Miami Vice.  Very 80's and very neon, however the food was really good.
My friend who is from Vegas never heard of it, and when we got there he asked how did you find out about this.....I said it was on an HBO Show several times in the season.  
I had an Tostada omelette.  I didn't realize they are 10 egg omelettes. It came with a mound of hash browns and a bagel.  I couldn't eat it all, and my friend had Eggs Benedict.  I sampled and the  Hollandaise was exceptional.  The price was really affordable and you can see that the place is really loved by the locals."}
{"text":"Pro: Anna in the Fireside Lounge, the fire pit in the fireside lounge, cool rose decor in the fireside lounge, did i mention Anna? 

Con: Slightly over price food in the Peppermill Restaurant, crazy lights in the Peppermill, so so food. 

Went to the Peppermill due to overwhelming good personal recommendations and of course Hazel's review. Not to mention the Rose Bowl was going and we needed a place with big screen to the watch the game. 

So, Peppermill it is and thank you god for that place. 

The hostess told us that the Lounge only have starters, so we planned on drinking and watching for a bit with a sampler, then head back to the restaurant for food during half time. 

We walked into a rose vine covered Lounge with the bar on the right and watery fire pits on the left, flat screen and semi circle couches are all over the place. The lounge server was Anna, a dark hair Romanian beauty that looks like a cross of Rachel McAdams and Lauren Graham but hotter, younger, with longer legs. Yes, I know I shouldn't be reviewing this place based on her, but it is that golden sunset at your Malibu mansion that sets your place apart to other locations. 

The food and drinks were a flowing, everything worked out with pretty good service. Then we left at half time for food, which just was a bit overpriced but it is very good. Service was prompt and Silviya's suggestion on the omelet are a great one. Milk shake and carrot cake were pretty right on the spot. 

Overall, if you are in Vegas, go see Anna in the Lounge for business meeting or to chill with friends. Food, you can save more money going to somewhere else, but probably not as good."}
{"text":"Excellent and quick service. Love the decor with fake trees and flowers all around, blue and purple colors all around, circular booths, and a wide menu. 

This is my second time coming here and both times were above average. Much better than most diners. Love the breakfast, lunch and drink menu. Haven't had a change to get dessert yet. I recommend the sin city blt sandwich that is a blt with pesto and overeasy eggs. Like the tall coffee mugs over other places that usually have a standard little mug. And like the strawberry Pina colada. 

Giant portions especially for breakfast. All egg breakfasts come with at least 3 eggs and the omelets look like 5 eggs. If you get the side order of cottage cheese, it's a lot. Around 2 cups. My dad couldn't finish an omelet, cottage cheese and a bagel, so I recommend coming here on a big empty stomach, share food or take food home."}
{"text":"Diner meets cocktail lounge. We came here after a late flight in from Miami. Very colorful, flamingo/tropical decor that has a cool vibe.

Our server, Victoria, was very friendly. It may seem odd, but if you're getting drinks, your table will also be approached by a separate, cocktail waitress.

The menu was a little too extensive for my taste, but it could be a great thing should you want to be able to pick from breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

The food was ok but to be fair, we weren't expecting much. I had the chicken quesadilla (eh); my brother had the reuben (better), and a friend had the conquest sandwich (she said it was fine, though she didn't finish it.)

Overall, a good place to know about for late night food/drinks near the end of the strip (past Encore/Wynn.)"}
{"text":"THIS IS VEGAS!

Vegas may have grown and evolved but this place stays the same. I have eaten here many times over the years. Recently I stopped in for breakfast and met Mary the night manager. I could not believe how nice she was considering all of the crazy drunk people she has to deal with during those hours. 

I stopped in to grab a carry out menu but they were out of them. Mary grabbed me a real menu and a pencil and paper so I could write down my order for the next day. I told you she was nice.  I called the next morning to place my order and Mary remembered me. I did a veggie omlette but I went all Sally from \"Harry met Sally\" on them. I went egg whites, no salt, no mushrooms and substituted to Swiss cheese.  Yeah I was that pain in the butt special order guy. I even asked for crispy hash browns. Mary took my order on the phone and even read it all back to me. She also told me my food would be ready in 10 minutes. 

I was finishing my run and headed over to grab my food. I was amazed at how fast I was able to get my food. Mary even went out of her way to get my hash browns really crispy. I saw her giving a little shout towards the cook. You go Mary!

My food was really hot and there was tons of it. I actually couldn't eat it all and saved half of it in my hotel fridge. Hey it's a desert out here, so food hoarding is acceptable here!  Everything was great. The hash browns were really rich.  I think they were cooked in butter. Mmmm...butter!!! I did have to use a few napkins to soak up the oil spill. The omlette was cooked perfectly but again it was huge. Big enough for two people to share. So keep that in mind when you eat here!

If your looking for an old school Vegas food place, then this is it. There is nothing left like it on the strip. So enjoy this place while it lasts because before you know it Trump or Wynn are gonna drop a Casino on top of it!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.  Huge portions - I had the eggs benedict both times I ate here.  Just too good to pass up.  Not the best I have ever had (thus the 4 stars) but this place is solid for breakfast lovers.  The French Toast plate looked amazing and more food than anyone I went with could eat.  This is a 5 or 6 am place to hit after you have been drinking all night and still have not made it to bed just yet."}
{"text":"Love coming here for brunch. The staff is friendly and attentive. Food portions are huuuge with more than enough to share. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Pyrotechnicality never underwhelms me. Light a match, and I'll show up. Set me before a 1970's liquid fire pit, and I'll bring friends. 

It's really all about the fireside lounge for me _ and the same should hold true for you if you go to the Peppermill. That is only if you've got a smoke and mirrors sense of humor and some velvet-covered disco fries left in the frying pan of your soul kitchen."}
{"text":"Wow, the place is quite the show. I mean there are very few neon lit diners in the US. It's definitely something unique to Vegas.

If you've burned some major calories pulling those slot machine levels then this is the place. Portions are ginormous which is why I assume a lot of people come here. Don't come here for health, come here for pleasure.

Service is hysterical...in a good way! We had a sassy waitress who basically told us what we wanted off the menu and she didn't get anything wrong. Wish I could remember her name but I do remember the food!"}
{"text":"loved this place! love the ambiance and decor.. the waitress' outifts are too funny.. ;) huge menu.. colored sugar in sugar shakers on every table?? hell yeah!! :) 24 hours?? even better!! it is kind of like a Denny norm's but fancier?? he he he.. had the club.. it was great! hubby had the ciabatta burger.. so delicious! both of us brought food back to our room..great late night snack!! couple next to us ordered a small nachos, it was HUGE!! definitely ordering those next time.. great service, friendly!! love the peppermill!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great American food and reasonable prices. Service is quick and it was fun being in all the neon lights and plants."}
{"text":"This place is a must visit in Las Vegas. If you want to drink in a rave like setting minus the music, this is the place for you. Huge drinks, reasonable prices, and  fun atmosphere. We had a great time and I highly reccomend a visit north!"}
{"text":"i always think of this place when i think of vegas or go there. this was the only place that was yummy the first time i went to vegas. i dont remember what i got.. it was frickin good though. just ask for suggestions, the waitress we had was so helpful. and they were nude,shiny leggings that makes their legs look GOOD. i want a pair. cant wait to go eat here, just sucks cuz i never stay anywhere that is close to the peppermill . going to vegas next weekend! hope i can hit up peppermill!"}
{"text":"If you want to take a step back into old Las Vegas this is the place to go.  fabulous atmosphere that has you feel it's 1970 all over again.  Portions are HUGE so bring an appetite or a friend to share"}
{"text":"Who cannot love this place!  Great food and even better atmosphere!  One half is a 70's jungle lounge where they serve food and the other half is a great bar with a fire pit inside!  The bloodies are AMAZING!  I try to stop here every time I am visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I were looking for a good, filling breakfast before hitting the casinos for the day, and we found The Peppermill. YUM! The decor was hilarious in itself. i could almost imagine I was on a movie or 70s TV set! The clientele on this morning was varied and several were obviously \"working girls\" winding down from the previous night. 

My French Toast platter and his omlette were both delicious and filling. Service was quick, attentive and friendly. We will definitely make this a stop for future Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"HUGE PORTIONS! 

Came here for lunch with my employers while I was attending a Seminar at the Hilton which is close-by. We came in and was seated promptly. Our waitress always had a smile and was quite the busy bee going from table to table. Impressive. 

I ordered a cheeseburger with fries. Markus and Miyoko ordered salads. When the salads came.. it really looked like 3 salads combined into one serving. Miyoko ordered the steak and mushroom salad that looked tasty.. Markus's salad was the same size but had an array of fruit on it. All of us were shocked of how big the portions were. I ordered my cheeseburger well done.. but it came back a bit burnt. I still ate it, but was a bit sad that it had been charred. 

All in all a good place to grab food. Especially since I heard the Riviera had crappy food joints to eat at. Would I eat here again? Only if I were in the general vicinity of the area. Its good to be back home in SF."}
{"text":"Had dinner on Christmas night with the family. I had salmon with mango salsa. It was just OK. A bit dry. Their crab cake appetizer was really good. My daughter has chicken and pasta. She didn't like it because it was too spicy, while hubby had fish and chips which he liked very much. The service was a bit slow, but not so much that it got to be annoying. I've been there before for lunch and sandwiches were very good. I would definitely go back, but won't order salmon again!"}
{"text":"Saw the waitress three times: once to take the order, once to bring the order, and once when I had to find her to get the bill.  Service was friendly, just non existent.  Prices are a little high.  But for the non-casino restaurant, its one of the better places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Las Vegas!  Been coming here for years, but on our most recent visit, we ate exclusively at Peppermill each morning.  The food is delicious and the presentation is photo-worthy (seriously, we saw two different guests taking pics with their meals before eating).  Love everything about this place - the neon, the cocktail servers in evening gowns at 7 am, the friendly wait staff, and - of course - the food.  I'm already thinking about our next visit!"}
{"text":"This review is based on breakfast alone, even if my meal was at 1:00 in the afternoon, it's Vegas, I'll call it breakfast. 
I've never been lucky enough to go to The Peppermill for dinner. By nightfall I'm usually off drinking too much rum and losing $. Dancing until my shoes are in my purse and a bouncer is yelling at me to put them back on. Fuck that guy! Well, The Peppermill is always there to save me the next day.
I'm super hungover, sad to see daylight, sunglasses lightly placed on my sad nogin. My temples have a heartbeat. 
\"Table for six\"
\"Name?\"
\"Idiot\"
\"It'll be a 30 minute wait, ok?\"
Now this is not a sad story. All down trodden hungover, breakfast seekers can wait in the fireside lounge! You have to see the place to believe it. They should charge admission. A giant circular fireplace that's always on, even when it's 110 degrees outside. They have bright pink couches, blue super squishy carpet and enough mirrors to satisfy the Kardashians, all back lit by subtle neon. The place has some ambiance, ok? 
Through a sea of faux cherry blossoms, the heroic cocktail server is there to save the day. YES! Lovely ladies in evening gowns serving cocktails at 11:00am on Sunday without judgment. I love drinking in the lounge while I wait for an amazing breakfast!
\"Idiot, party of 6!\"
\"Yay, that's me!\"
The menu is huge as are the portions. Be prepared to want a nap when you're done! I always get the steak and eggs. My husband gets the corned-beef hash with extra hash browns. I seriously dream about their hash browns! 
All in all this place is awesome. Great service, food, drinks, at a reasonable price and a Vegas atmosphere that you won't find anywhere else on The Strip."}
{"text":"This place is a definite MUST for everyone! I've been hearing about it for a few years now but I thought it would be too packed to even try it, I guess I was feeling pretty brave a couple months ago so me & a friend decided to give it a shot.....it was awesome!!! Not packed (but it was a Monday) & delicious!!! The portions are huge & I love the decor, it's old, tacky Vegas but in a good way! I've been there again since my initial visit & I loved it again, will definitely be one of my new traditions every time I visit. The only negative is that the waitresses were just ok, they could stand to be a little nicer."}
{"text":"Food is typical diner food. However, the staff is excellent. Not to sound superficial or anything but it seems like they have unbelievably pretty waitresses working there, and lots of them. It makes for a nice atmosphere. The ambiance in diner dining is the best here."}
{"text":"This place came with a great deal of hype (I am talking about the kind of hype one experiences in Los Angeles only to find that it is incredibly mediocre) that being said it is better than mediocre. My burger and \"Famous\" Onion Rings were good. The big thing that this place has going for it is the décor; low-lit neon, I give it a 9 out of 10 on the \"Groovy Scale\". Most certainly worth a look. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas....EAT AMAZING BREAKFAST is what I say. Peppermill is a genuine staple, it gives you that 80s feel along with the mafia/ movie casino feel. The pink and baby blue lighting illuminates the resturaunt, embodied by floral tree decor. Let's get to the point shall we, QUALITY is the underlining tone in all of this. Fresh ingredients are used, along with high quality food that you can taste. 

If you are trying to hard to find a good place to eat for a great price, look no further. There's plenty of places you'll over pay on the strip and can't even match the quality of their burgers and breakfast. This will always be a staple for me when I'm in town for one of my meals."}
{"text":"Was in town for a couple of days and was looking for a good local place to eat.

Found this whole doing a Yelp and decided to check it out.

I had the chicken pesto sandwich and my boyfriend got the Reuben.

The chicken sandwich was juicy and not dry, with a lot of flavor. 

My boyfriend really liked the Reuben as well. The portions of both dishes were huge! 

Great service and would definitely recommend visiting."}
{"text":"pleasantly surprised with excellent quality diner food. Crabcakes were the surprise and makes this place worth it. Ordered a shrimp omelette and was pleased. would def revisit"}
{"text":"Tried the Munch Breakfast which was sauted sausage, onions and bells mixed in their hash brown with eggs and cheese on top.  They saute was not drained, so there was about 1/8th of of a cup of oil in the bottom on the bowl.  This also made the hash soggy.  If they drained the oil out before the mix with the hash and flat topped to keep the hash crispy , it would be better.  Toast, Coffee and Service was good.  Just don't order the Munch."}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for awhile to try on my next Vegas trip.  Located down the strip almost across from Circus Circus, it is a little nostalgic gem among all the grand new hotels and restaurants.  From start to finish this place did not disappoint.  The inside was eclectic bordering between 60's and 80's vibes; fully of cool neon with a diner type feel.  The menu was massive, and so are the portions.  We had the shrimp cocktail to start which was delish, with five jumbo shrimp I should have just had a salad after to save room for dessert.  But I didn't.  My husband ordered the NY strip, I had chicken.  Both meals come with salad and the portions were so huge we should have just split a meal .  The food was really really great, my chicken was tender and the sauce flavorful.  Mashed potatoes were *real* and not sure why since they were just mashed potatoes but SO good.

The drink menu has some interesting and fun cocktails, we ordered a Scorpion which was 2 person cocktail (although I drank 3/4 myself) and it was wonderful.  Service throughout was on point.

There are some slot machines in the little lobby area, my husband ended up winning 200 bucks on a nickel machine while we were waiting on an Uber.

I am coming back here, and have probably already told 20 people to go here.  I truly hope this strip gem sticks around another 40 years!"}
{"text":"Very nostalgic eatery.  Nothing fancy ...more like a modified Denny's.  But I had the country steak which was good and service was great.  Definitely affordable and wide selection of food for your pleasure.  Fireside lounge next door looks like a former strip bar...but it's good place to kick back, get some drinks and view one of their many LCD TV's with current and past programing on.  A must visit at least once in your life."}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour, obviously because I love cheap drinks. They had $5 margaritas(which my friend ordered) as well as $5 Jim Beam & cokes(which I ordered). The drinks were not very strong at all. We also ordered the fruit & cheese plate($8), which was just cubed up block swiss & cheddar, grapes, a piece of pear and a cup of nuts + about 6 crackers. It was alright, but I could throw a way better cheese plate together with 8 bux, no problem. The reason I gave this place 3 stars instead of the 2 is the ambience & atmosphere. I love the comfy seating & the fireplace. It's SUPER dimly lit, which I love. Overall, I most likely will not be returning on my next trip to Vegas as the stage door has way stronger/cheaper cocktails & is pretty much the same thing, without all the fancy seating."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant with high hopes based on the 4 star rating it has, but I was so, so disappointed! We had a large group, about 10, and it took a really long time to seat us, even though we seemed to be the only people waiting in the front. They finally sat us down with attitude after about 20 minutes when we complained. Then we were served by the most sassy waitress I've ever had, whose idea of asking for orders was, \"What you want?!\" After waiting for our food for a good bit we were all served our breakfast...cold. The Munch's Breakfast I ordered was literally thrown down on the table in front of me and was abysmal. The eggs tasted powdered or like they were sitting under a heat lamp for a while. The sausage had gross texture and flavor. Everything about the dish was sub-par, which was particularly annoying when one takes into account how EXPENSIVE the whole meal was. I know things in Vegas aren't cheap, but a simple egg scramble with some veggies and meat for like $14? Come on! For all 10 of us the meal came out to around $225. No one, and I mean no one, at our table enjoyed the dining experience at The Peppermill. The service was rude, the food was terrible and overpriced. My advice to someone looking for some good breakfast: go anywhere else. Hell, drive out to Primm and eat at a gas station- it'll be half the price and just as good."}
{"text":"An old world Vegas atmosphere with heaping plates of artery-clogging joy. They also have a lounge where you can sit by the fire and pick up a hooker over the age of 40. In all seriousness, though, you should go. Take shots of fireball until you don't remember."}
{"text":"Really happy with this place.

The fireside lounge is cool.. Has a nice fireplace surrounded by a pool of water.

The rainbow-colored sugar is cool. The desserts are huge & even their entree portions are huge. This place gives an old school vibe with all the flamingos & \"flappers\" style uniforms.

This place is definitely a place to go to share food."}
{"text":"Delicious food with generous portions... and open 24 hours a day.

This is the true vegas version of Dennys, except here the food is actually tasty!

Great atmosphere that holds on to a little of the Vegas from years past... always great people watching as well!"}
{"text":"** Summary **

Obviously designed by someone extraordinarily high on cocaine, The Peppermill is one of the wackiest places I've ever eaten at.  Had breakfast in the \"restaurant section\" during morning rush and regretted it, but overall a pleasant experience  Off-hours visits are a must... and don't go here if you have epilepsy!   

** Details **

Heard great but conflicting things about The Peppermill.  It was described as: \"a great bar\", \"a great breakfast diner\", \"a great lounge\", \"a great coffee shop\", \"a great late-night hang out\", and \"a great nudie bar\".  It was all those things.

I should have taken my friend's advice and visited the Peppermill's lounge in the late evening instead of having breakfast in the restaurant.  As far as breakfast goes, it was good but fairly normal... except for the 60 minute wait.

Go!"}
{"text":"Very cool diner and lounge.  Lounge is very cozy and has a huge fireplace to sit around.  Always good service, always good food, always a good time.  A Vegas legend."}
{"text":"The food is like Denny's. Lets get that out of the way first. Nothing new is going to hit your palette. The atmosphere and people watching are divine. A Vegas landmark well worth the hike or deuce ride if your reading this a 2:00 a.m.  Busy and fun."}
{"text":"I live in town and cherish old school Vegas as it is slowly disappearing. This place is holding on with both Fists. Walk into here and it's like no other place you've ever been. When they were filming Casino next door at the Riviera Sharon Stone Pesci and De Niro  use to hang out here. As a matter of fact a couple of the scenes were filmed here. Where the Sharon Stone character asks for money and goes to the restroom then when she comes back to DeNiro asks, \" any change?\". The place is great.  When they implode it, I'm moving."}
{"text":"Coolest place for breakfast or late night eats in Vegas! A must see, must eat! Order 1 pancake they are huge but oh so delicious!  And the rainbow sugar is so fun!"}
{"text":"This place has seen some History. It's like taking a trip back in time here in Las Vegas, neon lights,purple plush,flamingos and flower prints.

The diner is pretty small with intimate seating and the lounge is out of this world with the fire pit off the bar. Very cool atmosphere.

Service was a little slow-I mean they came out for drinks from the bar immediately but it was another 15 minutes before anyone stopped back by since we're NOT drinkers.

We ordered sandwiches and an appetizer since we were extremely hungry & didn't wanna wait long for them to re-invent something in the kitchen. I ordered the Gyro plate, the wife had Hot Pastrami n Rye and the boy wanted macaroni & cheese with Fruit!!

The food came out quickly, the appetizer was not what I expected but was good nonetheless.(could've used more bread & cherry tomatoes)

The Pastrami & potato Salad A+-Huge portion, great pastrami and fresh & tasty potato salad.

The gyros were great but the pita was a little dry. The Onion Rings were good but straight out of the freezer NOT handmade.

The macaroni & cheese was good, the fruit was fresh.

OVERALL: Good Food,OK service and Great Atmosphere. A little pricy($50 for 3 people sandwiches) Nothing gourmet but solid."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast during world of concrete.
We waited for 30 minutes to get seated and that was the only downside.
Service was awesome.  Food was awesome.
Try the pancakes.  They are about 10\" diameter.
The parfait is my go to for hangovers.
For a more Vegas experience, come in around 5am and watch the \"end of shift activities\"."}
{"text":"Vegas classic. If you don't hit it up, just because of that alone, you've missed a bucket list item - shame on your drunk ass! Go."}
{"text":"Koo Koo Kids And Their Koo Koo Lounge Set

Luckily I was able to come back to Peppy-mill. First rule of vacationing in Vegas or in general is to fully explore where you are so you don't have to go thru an epic battle to get back to it later. I had been here the week before to spend some quality time in the lounge. While you can order food in the lounge (not just the fruit salad in your drink), the restaurant is a whole different experience. I was in the lounge the week before and I had to go back to the restaurant part.

I've been on a mission this particular week, looking for people I worked with. 

The food is incredible, you can see by the pics. Everything IS over the top, but it was already that way if it makes sense. Restaurants now try to make everything over the top with what I call Epic Menu. It's already been spoofed online and in tv. You have millions of \"mash up\" options can get combos that don't make sense just to be creative (i.e. burger taco?). Restaurant developers have gone crazy from all the cooking shows on tv trying to come up with new trends. But here, they just have many... accessories? To things that make sense that you don't get at the national corporate graveyard restaurants. 

Something happened/s at this bar (meaning counter service, not the lounge, just went over this!) that I haven't encountered at any restaurant I've ever been to. The portions are so huge, if you go by yourself, you will have leftovers. That's given. 

So, I have been to the counter by myself before. This is probably the only restaurant I regret going to by myself because I always enjoy going with a committee of people, we always wind up sharing and sampling each other's food. And that's because the 32 volume leather bound menu can give you an indecisive aneurism when ordering. 

One of the first times I ate here was with a group of Goths I started hanging out with. There was one who decided to go to the empty booth next to us and push her breasts against the window. And while everyone was stupid enough to not take a picture of this (this was back when we still could have put it on myspace), the memory of it struggles and blurs every time I try to rethink of it. I just remember black and lace and... volume. I did go on to date her after months of hanging out \"as friends.\" and it was damn worth it. I have to mention the best off the menu special I ever got here, amirite? 

So, at the counter, hungover one night by myself, I had a bunch of leftovers and I seriously doubted it would make the long journey home. I was walking since my motorcycle was possibly at Sahara, or Stratosphere, that kind of night. A couple of seats down this cute couple of girls were also finishing their meals with 2/3's left over as well. They asked me if I wanted to scoot over and help them finish. And then we ate our meals, hey-ooo! See what I did there? They were on vacation and their next trip, we got together again. You probably know I love Peppermill, right? 

There was one more story I wanted to tell, but you get the idea of how great this place is. We went here the night they imploded Stardust. I'll have to figure out where I can continue that story unless I want to do a clearly obsolete review of Stardust? the only place more over the top than the Peppermill is the Peppermill CASINO in Reno. My best attempts would underdescribe that LSD farm."}
{"text":"Buffets are overrated and the free breakfast at your mid-budget hotel is just cellophane bagels and hard-boiled eggs.  Solution?  The Peppermill.  It's freestanding, not buried in some casino, so you can park for free and be in the door right away.  If there is a wait, go hang out in the Fireside Lounge and have a delicious Bloody Mary.  It will quiet the demons.  

Upon entering, you will see that the pink, purple, and aquamarine color scheme is so becoming when combined with the thousands of disco-ball mirrors lining the ceiling. Fuchsia neon gives the place all the warmth of a stretch limo circa your cousin's quinceanera in 1986.  The flamingo-patterned Tiffany-esque lampshades are the essence of class, as are the velour booths.  On every table is a dispenser full of rainbow sugar which matches the decor.

If you think all this sounds cheesy, I want you to know that the place is in perfect condition and squeaky, crazy, pristine clean.  Yes, there is a jungle of silk plants but not a speck of dust anywhere.  It is a lovely, inviting restaurant.  If you have ever been to the Madonna Inn, you will know what I am talking about: well-maintained kitsch is like a beautiful rhinestone-bedazzled Nudie suit one is never ashamed of wearing.  

The breakfast portions are enormous.  The fruit plate is more like a party platter for 12.  Two people could split an omelet and leave the table full.  The hash browns are crispy, not soggy or greasy.  

These are restorative foods.  Combined with the Peppermill's professional, attentive service, you can feel your hangover receding with each bite.  I always leave the Peppermill ready for my day's events, whether sunburning by the pool, shopping in the outlets, hiding in a dark hotel room watching \"Ladyhawke,\" gambling away my retirement savings, or braving the gridlock on the 15.  Go disco breakfast!"}
{"text":"I went back to Peppermill and took my cousin there around 9am.  We went there for breakfast and I had pancake combo (3 pancakes, 2 sausages, 2 bacons, and eggs). Boy, the pancake was huge and the whole meal was delicious.  The photographer comes around and take photos for free.  The 2 frames and photos are $20.00 which is a great deal.  By the time we finished there was a long line of people waiting for a table. I love this place."}
{"text":"It's a tradition of course.  And there will be lines.  We arrived around 8:30 on a weekday and - still a 30-minute wait for a table for 4.

It's as old school as it gets.  You can easily imagine mobsters and movie stars mingling around here a few decades ago, drinking large colorful cocktails and oversized martinis.  Which is exactly why I've wanted to go here forever.  

While the food was pretty good, it's all a little too much for the morning.  It's too much food (way too much).  It's too much to have cocktail waitresses pushing drinks in sexy costumes in the early am.  And after a while, all the tacky and gaudy eventually got to me and I just wanted to get somewhere I didn't suspect the same air has been circulating for the last 45 years.

The Flintstones-sized food:
Biscuits and gravy for my niece - in a bowl as big as her head
A piece of ham steak for my brother - larger than his head and requiring two hands to lift the plate
A side of scrambled eggs with cheese for me - I really only wanted one egg as I like a light breakfast...  but their \"side order of egg\" is actually THREE eggs.  
A spinach omelet for my SIL that looked great but was also ginormous.

Look, everything was good.  It's just TOO TOO much --  unless you're planning on going from breakfast right back to bed (and maybe that's your plan - I don't judge).  We had a full day of sightseeing planned and there is just no way you can even make a dent in these portions and expect to be ambulatory right after.   Trying to order \"light\" doesn't work either - they are determined to feed you until you cannot move at the Peppermill.  I felt bad about all the food waste --  normally I take food home and make several meals out of it, but that isn't practical when you're sightseeing all day and staying in a hotel.  

Oh, and there is someone that comes around and tries to take your picture.  This is one of the most annoying things a restaurant can do.  

All this abundance doesn't come cheap.   Breakfast for 4 with coffees/sodas was over $70 before tip.  If you really need to be in a food coma, this is a way to do it.   Or split an omelet and that giant ham steak with the entire table and still be able to walk after your meal."}
{"text":"This lounge/restaurant is typical Vegas. If you come here, definitely sit down at the lounge with the fireplace. Just that is an attraction in and of itself. The place still retains the old school Vegas feel. We came here on an off night so it was relatively good with minimal herding. They will take complimentary photo's so ask about that. Will definitely come back to this place on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! Love the taste of the food. For the price, the serving portion is very giving! Their bagels are also delicious! Come early for breakfast and odd hours during the day, the wait can take long. They do their best to turn tables over though."}
{"text":"I freaking LOVE this place!  All the times I would go to Vegas and drive by, I would think--I  want to go there because it looked so funny.  

Anyways, last February is the first time I went to the Peppermill with my then fiance--but now turned hubby.  :)  He said this place is linked to a chain in NorCal and Tahoe?  Anyways...it was pure bliss.  Much better than most food at the hotels.  

I had the buffalo chicken wrap.  It was amazing!  My husband had the patty melt and it was delish!  The portions are huge...great leftovers when you wake up all cruda the next morning!  Plus they are open 24 hours...so you can go in all drunk, lol!  Anyways, this place is awesome and funky.  they have red white and blue sugar granules that you can even buy!

The lounge is awesome and they have these cocktail servers that roam the restaurant in these funky black dressses and the servers in the restaurant wear funky polyester uniforms...pretty funny.  I loved the fireside lounge too!  So funny!  good crowd!  I love places like these! :)"}
{"text":"Mixed emotions about this place. A Lyft driver told us about them so we gave it a whirl. It wasn't really close to our hotel but the yelp pictures we saw made it seem so much more elegant than it was. The outside of the building looked pretty outdated, but I didn't want to judge a book by it's cover. At first glance it reminded me of a cheap diner. We walked in and told it was a 30 min wait for a table of 3. In the meantime, we went to the lounge to wait which is what really lost me. It was super dark, the tables were dirty as well as the velvet like booths. It just looked dingy and dirty, but the fire they had going was beautiful! Our waiter came and asked us what we wanted/clean the table as soon as we sat down... Of course we didn't know what we wanted as we had just gotten there. Probably took her 20mins to come back and right after we ordered our name was mentioned over the intercom. After getting our table she closed our tab and we moved over to the dining area. 

After all that, why am I giving a 4 star? Because the food was great! Big portions, and amazing tasting food. We got the platter for the appetizer so we could taste a little bit of everything and it was all good! After that I was full so I just did the turkey sandwich which was also amazing. Although the decor and the dresscode through me off, I'd still return."}
{"text":"This review is for the cozy, tropical themed bar area.  It reminded me of Hala Kahiki (Anyone from the Chicago area should know what I am talking about) yet way cleaner and prettier.  I loved the fire pits surrounded by water.  What a cool picture I have of me sitting by one.  This was just enough away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip to not feel like a tourist trap (even though I'm sure it is).  The drinks they had were mostly the overly sweet variety for 21 year olds and that's why they didn't get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"The service was good, the eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns were very good. Bacon was not crisp, the sausage was very blah and unappetizing. The biscuit in the biscuits and gravy was tender but the gravy needed some flavor. The chicken fried steak was good. The pancakes were inedible. They were heavy as cement, tough and tasteless. I was really looking forward to eating here. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Mary. I would come back any day. Not only is the food always amazing, we have always experienced perfect customer service. I will continue to come back and refer others. Thank you Mary and Luis!"}
{"text":"Ahh..The Peppermill.  You step inside and you feel like you've been transported back in time, with big comfy booths, and pink and purple neon lights all over the place.  

If your eyes are bigger than your stomach, then this is not the place for you.  Portions are just huge, everything from salads, huge pastrami sandwiches, omelettes, chicken, and burgers will overcrowd your plate when brought out!

After your meal, step into the other side of the restaurant over to The Lounge, where they have a full bar (low top), several booths, and a sunken circular seating area with fire coming out of a bubbling fountain.  Fantastic place to have some cocktails and relax.  And, if you happen to just come in for food, their nachos plate is enough to feed 6 people!

One of the best on-the-strip places to go that feels like you're off the strip!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. This place is absolutely awesome. Right on the strip, open 24/7/365. It is classic old school Vegas. The Fireside Lounge was used in the movie Casino along with a few other movies. The food is good, the prices are reasonable by Vegas Strip standards. The portions are huge. I lived in Vegas for four years and avoided the Strip like a plague when I wasn't working. But I never minded going to the Strip for Peppermill. I took my parents there every time they came to visit during my time there. Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a place! We walked in and everything in my hungry body just said \"yaaaaasssssssssss!\"
It's everything I could want in a Vegas diner.
It's got the classic diner feel, but with the neon lights you'd expect from a rave or night club, but with a menu that everyone (including the hipster community) can love.
I also really like the free photo they take of you. The mirrors everywhere add to the magical ambiance as well.
Do yourself a favor and don't skip this because you think it might be weird. It is, but it's wonderful."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great atmosphere, perfect service, absolutely horrible management skills ."}
{"text":"I want to protect your wallet, you worked hard for that Green!  I highly recommend not coming here for breakfast.

A. you get average food and pay high dollar

B.  you get farted on, that's right farted on.  Some barnyard ignorant lewd ugly  barbarous uncivil constuction worker ripped beaf upon leaving his table with two other uncouth barbaians.  His foreman took them out for breakfast (they drove off in a black cadillac) And I wrote down the plate number

I know someone that knows someone who pulls alot of strings here in Vegas and when I find you,  I am going to have you and your crew black balled from working any job in Vegas

You blew your stink towards the wrong table you illiterate slug

You won't be laughing when you get fired, infact you may just shart yourself"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is by far the best hidden gem on the strip. I have had breakfast here for years and never disappointed. The servings are huge (for breakfast). I have never found triple eggs benedict anywhere but here. The service is outstanding. Hats off to a great Management team because the waitresses have been here a long time. They seem to enjoy their job which makes your dining experience that much better. LOVE the Peppermill!!"}
{"text":"The wait is worth it.  You can go in the lounge to have cocktails to kill the time for your name to be called makes the wait seem better. Believe me when I say is worth it."}
{"text":"By far one of the best values on the Strip for delicious drinks. The ambiance at The Fireside lounge can't be beat at any of the hipper bars. My favorite drink is The Scorpion . It's delicious , strong and at $18 a deal of a drink and big enough to share. Everyone can feel at home at this uber cheesy yet somehow amazing lounge. My only complaint would be that every time the bar tender uses the blender the sound system cuts out ."}
{"text":"What don't I love about this place. The decor looks like you stepped into Elton John's living room (as if I know..haha). Every time I've eaten there the waitress's have always been very attentive, Oh and they aren't bad looking. The prices may seem a little high at first, but when you see the portion sizes, the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Five stars for all the years of great memories...this is the place to go if you want a taste of Vegas as it once was...the restaurant has been my go to spot since I was a toddler, good solid food, big portions, friendly and fast service, fun Vegas style sparkly interior...the lounge with their indoor fire pit, great cocktails, old school videos,friendly cocktail dress wearing servers, and if your lucky fellow customers that walked right out of a mob movie with their lovely ladies, all make for one great experience that is not to be missed ; }"}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. Most of it is a large, eclectically decorated diner and there is also a decent sized lounge in the back. There is a large parking lot out front and even more space out back. This place gets crazy busy so plan ahead. There is a ton of seating, and they turn tables fairly quickly but there is often still a wait. If you come during any peak meal hours be prepared to wait.

The dining area is a series of large booths. There are neon lights all over and a mirrored tile ceiling, much like a disco ball. There are also a ton of plants scattered through out the diner.

I ordered the Joe's San Francisco Special without spinach. It is a combination of scrambled eggs, pork sausage, ground beef and onion served on a bed of crispy hash browns with a cheese sauce. As with all of their meals you get a large portion. You will not leave hungry. The flavors all combined nicely as did the textures. I was quite happy with my choice.

Overall the service was good, the food was good, the portions are larger and it is affordable. The only issue is the crowds. It is quite popular, but also worth it."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointing experience.

I went last night with two of my girlfriends after dancing away at the Rock in Rio festival. One of my friends who is a born and raised Las Vegan said The Peppermill is a Vegas staple and we HAD to go because my other friend and I have never been. By the time we arrived it was around 2:30am. The restaurant was packed and there were at least three parties waiting ahead of us. We were starving so we asked if we could go into the lounge (located in a large room to the left of the main restaurant) and the hostess nodded, so we went and seated ourselves.

The ambiance is something else!! Probably the only positive about this place. Neon lights in a dark spacious room, with comfortable booths, a fountain, and surprisingly a lot of greenery. I felt like I was in a different decade.

Our female server seemed annoyed and wasn't the friendliest when she greeted us. I don't think she smiled once. We ordered a few beers and appetizers as we could only order from the app menu in the lounge which we didn't mind. We got a round of blue moons and ordered crab cakes, ground beef nachos, mozzarella sticks, and buffalo chicken wings.

A different server came by and asked if we wanted to start a tab. We closed out since we were mainly hungry and were good on our beers. It didn't take too long for the food to come out (20 min?) and we were excited to chow down. 

- Crab Cakes; Average, nothing special. I think we got 4 of them and they came with a creamy sauce 
- Buffalo Chicken Wings; Lukewarm but the buffalo sauce was delicious! Came with carrots and celery per usual
- Nachos; HUGE portion. Had cheese, jalapeños, black olives on top. The cheese was cold and dry. They gave us a separate bowl of beans and another of the ground beef. Not sure why they wouldn't just top off the nachos with the two. Also came with guac, pico, and sour cream. 
-  Mozzarella Sticks; The most disturbing part of my experience. I bit into the cold mozzarella stick and out came a long strand of lighter hair. I was grossed out but know that these things happen. When I reacted to this hair in my mouth, my other friend laughed and said the one she bit into earlier had a hair in it too but just took it out. Hair in two mozzarella sticks out of five...?

We were having a fun night and didn't really want to take the effort to complain. The mozzarella sticks weren't good so if they offered to bring us a new batch, we would have declined. Also, I don't believe a single server came by to our table after we paid for our tab and received our food. Also not worth hunting down service.

Needles to say the food and service here is poor in my opinion, however, the ambiance in the lounge is very neat. If I were to ever come back, I would probably go for a drink at the bar in the lounge just to enjoy the neon lights."}
{"text":"This place is just plain retro cool. Great diner food, big menu, and even bigger portions. You won't be disapointed."}
{"text":"My written review is way overdue. This place is a must place to eat at while in Vegas. And as a local, I've came here a lot. Their biscuits and gravy is more then enough to feed two and tasty...my favorite on the menu."}
{"text":"The yelp  hype, had to go... this place is like a bad Denny's with mediocre food. Long wait to get seated, BUT classic old school Vegas turquoise booths and atmosphere with great cocktails! Okay, who needs food anyway... Bring me another martini please."}
{"text":"It was 10pm and we'd just gotten to town. We were starving and wanted to try this place out, as it came highly recommended by friends, family and yelp. We were not disappointed. 

Parking was a breeze, since they have a private lot. The menu was huge. I had some kind of taco omelet (can't remember it's name exactly), with hashbrowns and a blueberry muffin. Everything was delicious, especially that muffin. My uncle had the Peppermill Omelet with hasbrowns and a muffin, which he said was delicious. 

Service was fast and friendly. The ambience was...unique and fun. Overall, we would return to this place and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Looks like a neon factory threw up in here. For added bonus: cherry blossom trees that reach the ceiling, and flamingo lampshades. This place screams tacky in ways I never thought possible, and to make it even better, mirrored walls and ceilings amplify your...experience."}
{"text":"Cool place with a good dose of history - popped in after an early show and it was mostly empty. The service was a tad confusing although friendly (why do we give our orders to three separate people?) and our waitress was very accomodating with our weird requests. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area and it is not super busy."}
{"text":"Every time I visit LV I have to have at least one late night breakfast here.  2 years ago I asked one of the local taxi stand workers where to go and get something to eat after leaving the club.  He named a few places and then I asked, \"where would you go?\" He said to the Peppermill and I've been sold every since.  
The service has always been nice, quick and courteous.   I can't suggest too much from the menu because I'm always ordering the steak and egg breakfast. Very good for the price.
I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If Las Vegas had a diner...it would be this one. The good news is .... it does.  From the neon colors to the sparkling colored sugar it is a visual treat. Great food, service and people watching. I had a cheeseburger for breakfast...and it was perfect!

Jennifer, at the counter, is awesome."}
{"text":"Having been to Vegas so many times I finally made it a priority to check out this joint that came highly recommended by a friend of mine who happens to be a local.
For drinks we started out with a few daiquiris to set the mood.
We started with the walnut creek salad which is served with a pear cilantro dressing. Candied nuts, chicken, blue cheese, craisins...this one had everything! We also split the caprese ciabatta sandwich, but could only handle half the bun. I highly recommend the onion rings!!
The food was good, the ambiance is old Vegas, and the prices are a bit high, but I'll be sure to come again when back in town. I'll also be sure to save room for a sundae because they looked fabulous!"}
{"text":"Huge portions...nothing super fantastic about the food but we had to come to the iconic Peppermill...I've been coming to Vegas since I was a baby and had never had the opportunity to come by here until last August...i'm glad I did...I came, I ate and I saw...I might be back again but there are soooo many amazing options in Vegas that this will fall pretty low on my \"restaurants to repeat\" list"}
{"text":"+Our waitress was one of the best I've ever had.
+The nachos were crazy huge. If we went back, we'd skip our entrees and just order the nachos.
+The Conquest was delicious. I only ate half the sandwich and two of my onion rings. 
+We were staying at Encore, so it provided a super cheap alternative to anything sold in our hotel.

-I feel like the prices would be out of control anywhere else, but since this is Vegas, slightly overpriced seems cheap.
-Trying to sell us pictures of ourselves at our table was just...weird and tacky."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! It was recommended by an great uber driver.  The food was fantastic and the service matched. The portions are huge, you get what you pay for. And since its 24hrs you'll always have somewhere to go for a full day menu"}
{"text":"Omigod, I don't know how we managed to miss this place in the 9 or so years we've been in Vegas!  I'd heard about it forever, but finally went after a performance of La Cage aux Folles at the Smith Center ran a lot longer than we expected.  It was late, we were very hungry, and I figured they'd be open.

I was unprepared for all the neon.  But I LOVE neon, so this place had my kind of vibe.  It took a long time to slog through the big menu, but as we were looking I was also noticing the size of the portions passing by, so we decided to share an omelet, with hash browns and a toasted bagel.

The omelet was gargantuan, and when I asked our waitress how many eggs it had, she said \"about 10.\"  That meant four eggs for me, since I always make sure hubby has a bigger portion.  That's usually my quota for six months.  I've never been a big fan of home fries, but these were the bomb;  I just couldn't stop eating them.  My only nit was the bagel, which was barely toasted, but I think even more toasting couldn't have saved it.  You can't pass off this thing with a whole to a New Yorker and really get away with it.  It looked like a bagel, but didn't quack like one.

We didn't have drinks, but had a good time looking at the mammoth drink being shared at the table next to us.  Next time we will indulge, either in the restaurant, or in the lounge, which I made sure to check out before we left.  Spectacular!, and I can't wait to try it.

This all took place the night before I was to leave for Jersey for an extended period.  The next night, friends were arriving from the East Coast, and where did hubby take them?  You guessed righ.  And that couple liked it so much that all three of them went back the next night, too.   With all that food, I hope I'll recognize my husband by the time I get back!

Peppermill is the closest thing to our beloved East Coast Greek diners, but in true Vegas style, glitzier, bigger, brighter, and over the top.  In a good way."}
{"text":"First time there.   Yummy.  Huge freaking portions.    The mai tai's are kick ass good!!    The 1st courses are big enough for a main course.  The omelets are huge.   Service is spot on and super friendly"}
{"text":"You must go here when you visit Vegas!  I found this place after reading reviews. Went for breakfast & it was the best meal we had on our trip.  The portions are huge! More than a person can eat in a sitting.  It was a great value.  The waitresses were great. We enjoyed the free photo post card too.  Parking in their lot is easy too."}
{"text":"I took my relatives here for a late dinner. I love it because it feels like Vegas with neon illuminating all over. It's a flashy place all the way to the colorful sugar crystals on the table. I remember when I first moved here we would frequent this place often. It was nice to see it really hadn't changed.

I started with the Tortilla soup because it was chilly in there. The soup was huge but too salty for me.  I only had a couple spoonfuls. I shared half of a roast beef sandwich with my brother. It was a good size. It was yummy and the veggies on it were fresh ! My cousin ordered the appetizer that came with chicken tenders, bruschetta, onion rings,  mozzarella sticks,  onion rings and butterfly shrimp. It was enough to share with the five of us. We still had left overs! The shrimp was my favorite because they were big and crunchy. We all shared a huge sundae which was tasty brimming with gooey chocolate ...yum!"}
{"text":"My hubby absolutely loves this place. He lived in Vegas for years and had never been! Their breakfast was good so we came back to try it for dinner. Not bad! It seems to be pretty packed constantly but the wait for two people isn't bad if you're open to sitting at the bar. The day time and night time waitresses wear different outfits and it's all very \"Alice in Wonderland\" (I'm assuming that's what they're going for). All in all pretty cool with a good group of staff that gets things out decently quick. They have different servers for food and alcohol though which was weird (who wants to tip twice in a meal...?) but we definitely liked it."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Come hungry cuz the portions are humongous. As others have said the décor is something else. Glitzy neon everywhere, faux everything, this is Vegas. But the food is really good. The service was pleasant and though the place was pretty busy it wasn't loud so we could talk. I would bring my family."}
{"text":"I'd like to say more of a 3.5 than a 3.
The inside is sorta cute. Comfy Boothe's and fun colors. Sort of a night club coloring but more if a diner vibe. They did a great job of fitting as much seating as they could and yet its still comfortable because they are booths and not tables on top of each other.
They had a TON of fake flowers all over the place. Even fake trees in the center. I really am not a fan of all that fake flower crap, the colors are usually off of real stuff. The fake stuff gets SO darned dusty, too, and that's just plain gross especially in a restaurant environment. The one fake ivy thing by me didn't feel dusty, but we were still thankful we weren't stuck under one of the trees.
They have a cocktail waitress, which kind of reminds you of old style Vegas. The cocktail we were handed didn't list Amy beer at all, so I had to wait for her to come to our table to find out what they had. 1 draft option, Stella, so I ordered it. Alas, they were out. So I ordered a bottles beer. Wouldn't it be the cocktail waitresses job to know that there's no Stella tonight?

Anyway...
The menu was what you'd expect in a diner, lots of choices and many fried.. And it was about the quality that you'd expect - we had cream cheese stuffed chicken with penne pasta and country fried steak with mashed potatoes. My hubby said the mashed potatoes were average and enjoyed the country fried steak. My cream cheese/herb stuffed chicken was fried and not too bad. LOADS of pasta, way more than one portion.

We also had dessert - a brownie Sunday for the hubs and strawberry shortcake for me. I asked for some fudge to be added to it and they accommodated (it's super yummy that way)."}
{"text":"Awesome! Ambiance is great, decor is very vegas/casino...Bloody Mary's were ok, but eggs Benedict were great!! Their hash browns were so good. And they have a free photographer walking around to the tables...definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Worth the wait to eat massive portions of consistently delicious food. My favorite omelet is the Maserati."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out because the pictures looked super cute. Came here after dinner specifically for dessert but they had some really yummy looking drinks that I wanted to try (maybe next time). The ambience was really nice they had a cute theme going on. I expected a fire pit because of the pictures but I guess that was the lounge which we didn't go to because they said they didn't have the full menu. Anyway, from the pictures, the banana split looked fantastic so I ordered that and my friend ordered the strawberry shortcake. When our food came we were in shock because they were massive! I mean I've never seen a banana split that big before. I guess I just wasn't expecting it. The waitress said it was big enough to share but dang it could feed a couple of people. Presentation wasn't too good. Couldn't even see the ice cream because of all the whipped cream but there was 2 scoops of ice cream for each flavor and you had to dig around for the banana. The strawberry shortcake was okay, not my cup of tea really. My banana split turned to soup because we couldn't finish it. Looking at the other tables all the plates were huge. All in all, it was a good experience. My tip would be to come here if you're really hungry. Will come back to try the rest of the food (to share ofcourse!)

PS. they gave a free souvenir photo of your table which I thought was really cute"}
{"text":"Went around 10am on a Friday and the place was packed, wait was 30-45 minutes.  We went to the lounge and sat by the fire pit,  waitress came almost immediately for our drink order.  Me and my husband both order fruity drinks which were large and very good.  The lounge is nice to sit and take in the views of the all the neon lights and watch old rock videos that they play on the tvs.  When we went to get a second round we could not find a waitress.  When we got our table, service went quick.  I got Joes San Francisco special which is enough for 2 people and very good.  Husband got French toast ambrosia which was good and also a large portion.  Coffee was also good."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying the food is great and they give you alot!! My husband ordered a pastrami burger. We had a sampler for appetizer.  I had a gyro. Our 2 kids had chicken fingers.  Well the wait was long. There was. A \"professional photographer \" that wanted to take a pic of us so we did and she told us she be right back. We sat there for a lonnng time. She never came. Then our waitress bring 3 out of 4 orders and tells me she is gonna be right back. She took 7 minutes ( she was cleaning tables and what not) to finally bring my husbands food. Then took forever to get our bill. Finally get the bill and she charged us for 2 adult chicken fingers. We didnt want adult. Lady at counter claims waitress was new. But good side was great food. I ordered gyro and it came with 2 with lots of fries."}
{"text":"Vegas kitsch with great diner food!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE bar in Vegas! I insist on coming here EVERY time I come to Sin City for at least one Scorpion (always on the rocks) to help kick the party into high gear. 

Solid food here too!"}
{"text":"Old school, big portions, ask for fresh jalepenos and if you want to see locals other than the staff, go in the middle of the night."}
{"text":"I have been to the Peppermill a few times but never eaten here. Normally I go with friends and watch them drink while I have tea or soft drink in the fireside area. Which is a great place for a couple (you will be pleasantly surprised I Promise). We were there to eat and eat we did. The waitress was nice and looked 16 which I kidded her about but she was a good sport and a very good server. I found it to be a good time and I loved the pastrami sandwich (so lean) just writing this review makes me want to go back. I have not had a good pastrami sandwich in a while. The servings were healthy and everything was quite good. I will be going back. Who wants to come?"}
{"text":"Great food any time of the day!
love this spot
:)"}
{"text":"YES YES YES!

If you're in Vegas and you don't go to Peppermill, shame on you. And your momma. I am THAT serious. I was in the hunt for a brunch type restaurant that serves good bloody marys and Peppermill did not disappoint. This review is for the Fireside Lounge.

Ambience: 
As other reviewers have mentioned, the pink and blue neon lights give it a divey, strip club-esque vibe which I totally loved. There's a firepit in the center of the lounge area, complete with comfy seating and overhead TVs. There are several other TVs throughout the lounge. It's quiet, yet not awkward, perfect for the invariable hangover headache. Another plus: they're open 24 hours, so you *really* have no excuse.

Staff: 
The bartender was great, I wish I could remember her name. Very friendly, sincere and prompt. 

Food: 
The Fireside Lounge only offers food from the appetizer menu. I ordered the shrimp cocktail ($12.95) and a bloody mary (~$7). The bloody mary was definitely tasty, came garnished with a cherry tomato, a cucumber slice and a celery stick. I asked for olives and the bartender obliged. The shrimp cocktail came with 6 large jumbo shrimp, cocktail sauce, and what appeared to be shredded cabbage buried beneath the cocktail sauce. While the shrimp tasted great, they were a bit chewy/tough and may have been frozen a little too long. Also, I don't know that I would pay $13 for shrimp cocktail again.

All in all, the Fireside Lounge was the start to a perfect Vegas morning (if 1:15PM counts as morning when you're hungover)."}
{"text":"I do not know how this place has such good reviews on yelp except for the fact that I think a lot of people come here drunk at 5:00AM for a huge greasy breakfast, and when you are drunk, leaving the club, things taste a lot different.
I have been here twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch. Both times where exactly the same experience. 
The service was good, servers are attentive, food comes out quickly.
Thats where it goes all bad.......
The food is terrible. Greasy diner food that is equivalent to IHOP or Dennys.
I will say that the portions are huge. They give you a lot of food..... a lot of really really bad food!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. The portions are so huge, especially the pancakes and ham. I have always had good service and food. I have never had to return my plate for any reason. They have been consistently good. The bloody mary's are so good, one of the best in Vegas."}
{"text":"So we arrived on friday night and we were wanting to eat and we weren't wanting a all you can eat place. So I looked on yelp and read your reviews and I figured yes we will eat here. Turned out it was close by and we walked over from the Hilton Resort. Turned out this place is like a Denny's but with tripple the price tag and the portions larger. We all ordered breakfast and I would say we all enjoyed our breakfast. The place had a few roudy people but it was a good place to hang-out. The only thing that I would recommend is to be able to move the table out a little because I felt I was in a tight booth.  

As we left the place I wanted to check out the pool of fire but that was in another section and it was cozy in there but there was way too much smoke in there.  maybe next time were in the hood we'll check out the lounge area and hang."}
{"text":"The food wasn't great but not bad either it reminded me of a Denny's. The staff was friendly but kind of ignored us for their regulars which it seemed like there were quite a few. It's a bit expensive but then again what isn't on the strip."}
{"text":"Good value for the being on the strip. Plenty of food for the money. A classic Vegas go too."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time the other day and let me just say, BEST DECISION EVER. I had the chicken and red pepper pasta, my boyfriend got the Maserati Omelette with hash browns and we ordered a side of fries with ranch. You ofcourse can't forget the drinks!! Blue Hawaiian was like a bay breeze and he got a beer which I can't remember the name. DEFINATELY GOING BACK SOON!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the oldest places on the strip but it doesn't look like it inside. Well, I mean, it's stuck in the 70's but it doesn't feel rundown at all. It's old Las Vegas. 

We hit the lounge and got some tiki drinks and it was totally bad ass. You need to check this place out if you want to say you went to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Portion size would get 5 stars as they were huge. So if that's what you like, you'll be very happy here. We could easily have shared what we got. But flavor-wise, nothing was outstanding. We were there for breakfast and each had omelettes. Nothing stood out about them except the size. if you're hungry and you need somewhere to go that's open very early, this place will do (it's open 24 hours). It has the atmosphere of a 70s lounge, and you definitely know you're in Vegas (where else does a cocktail waitress come to take a bar order at 7 AM?). A little strange at that hour when you're ready for a trade show."}
{"text":"Everyone's eyes lit up when the food hit the table. Every plate was great. Drinks before in the lounge. Remember to take your hat off before entering lounge. The decor is right up there with the Madonna Inn."}
{"text":"We came to have drinks and happy hour.  The service is slow but the food is good.  Its smaller than i remember.   We got a new server ."}
{"text":"I still love this place, and will continue to bring visiting guests here, but this particular visit was less than stellar.  

We came at 1:00...my first time for lunch, and they were packed.  We had to be put on a waiting list, but it only took about 5 minutes to seat us. However, after being seated, it took them at least 10 minutes to even come ask for our drinks...well, non-alcoholic...the cocktail waitress was right there. Gotta love Vegas. 

Anyway, I ordered the Conquest (no onions of course) at the waitresses' suggestion and it was just mediocre. The roast beef was bland and the sandwich needed more sauce. The bread was good though. Fries were ok, but a little greasy.  The ice tea was good. 

Next time I will just go with my own choice. LOL!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, generous (!!!) portions, I got the burger my friend got the French Toast and we were both super happy! Decor is hilarious like an 80s porno."}
{"text":"Peppermill, how I wish there was one of you here in San Francisco after a drunken night. Thats ok, it's just one more thing I can look forward to when visiting Las Vegas. I love everything about Peppermill. The decor transports me to a magical tacky fairy forest. Perfect when you are drunk and looking for good eats. The waitresses are decked out in equally tacky but booty gazing outfits. Love it. They have plenty of personality too and you have to if you are wearing that fit. The food portions are huge so dont order multiple plates. If you are going with your significant other give the fireside lounge a try. Its really romantic sitting next to the fire with neon lights all around you sipping on a huge and delicious drink. They are open 24/7 so even if your late night turns into an early morning which tends to happen in Vegas stop in. Its not too far from all the major hotels and all the taxi drivers know whats up."}
{"text":"Good food if you're very hungry. Portions are huge. The ambience and decor are old and reminded me of an 80s movie. Nothing exceptional to brag about but does but the spot if you're looking a good quick bite."}
{"text":"What a cool place. Worked dropped me in Las Vegas and a co worker of mine wanted to get a quick dinner near his hotel. The Peppermill was across the street and I was game. 

I have stayed at the Peppermill Resort in Reno and there used to be a Peppermill Restaurant in San Jose, CA. that I visited that all share the same look at this joint. I do not know whether they are related . Anyways this place is like stepping into a time warp. It has an old feel and neon as far as the eye can see (my photos have a pinkish hue). We sat in the bar area of the restaurant called the Fireside Lounge. 

The drinks are cheap, the vibe is laid back and the nacho appetizer is a mountain of deliciousness. I dare you to finish it. The corn chips are layered with cheese, jalapeño, tomato, onion and black olive and came with a plate of ground beef and a plate of refried beans mixed with a nacho cheese. It is not fine dining but it is the perfect copilot for beer.

Between the vibe, beer and nachos I was one happy cat !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, Super service, terrific atmosphere. I had the pineapple express burger with curly fries and I was not let down. The fruit salad was HUGE and presented very well all the fruit was perfectly ripe. 
This will be my go to place for a good dinner."}
{"text":"Rev up for some retro of Classic Vegas! The ambiance at the Peppermill is unique with the neon, indoor artificial trees, and high-def TVs. I love the banks of TVs (only time I will ever say this).  The entrancing scenes are filmed all over the world. By the end of your meal, you have viewed beautiful footage from Alaska, China, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, Hawaii, and Paris. The wait staff is friendly and there is usually a photographer willing to help you capture a special dinner with out-of-town guests. I'm a local,and this is a great place to meet up with people. The food is good with generous portions and well-presented for the diner set-up. This come-as-you-are establishment won't break your budget either.  Don't eat too much of your ten-egg omelet or delish reuben, or there will be not room for a specialty frou-frou drink at the cozy Fireside Lounge. Their drink menu offers concoctions of every color of the rainbow.
The Peppermill can get crazy-busy and they are a little stingy with their colorful napkins. 
Overall, a fun, unique place. Hope you're hungry!"}
{"text":"Hehe! One of the best late night eats on my every 'business trip' to Vegas!! ;) awesome cocktails n great food!"}
{"text":". The best part of this restaurant was the ambience. When we walked up there was such a long line I swore it would be over an hr wait, however they seem to work very proficiently! Hasbrowns were gross, they tasted like cardboard. I ordered the tostada omelet, the meat inside tasted like chili.i was not a fan. Others in my party ordered a burgers which they said were good."}
{"text":"The scenery is peerless, neon-laced '70s kitsch. My enormo tomato-hollandaise chicken omelet didn't live up to its promise and the hash-browns were strangely subpar. Coffee: decent. Our waitress was stoned and the prices were a bit high too. Still, the convenience- (nice to be able to park right next to a decent eats on the strip) and cheese-factor make this a Vegas must."}
{"text":"The portions at this place are huge, no seriously, HUGE. I suggest sharing one entree with someone else, you'll definitely have more then enough food.

My coworker and I came here after working a trade show since it's super close and easy to get to from the convention center. I ordered the focaccia chicken sandwich along with curly fries. My only complaint was that the bread was a bit dry but the chicken was cooked perfectly and the curly fries were greet too. The ranch was sub par, but I'm somewhat of a ranch snob. 

The service was a little bit slow but eh it's on the strip technically so what do you expect. Overall the food is good and the old school Vegas feel is somewhat endearing as well. I'll for sure have to come back sometime for breakfast. Viva Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I always make it a point to eat at the Peppermill when I come to Vegas. You get great portions for the price and its always delicious!"}
{"text":"I had an 6 AM flight out of Vegas and my hotel had no early morning options for food. I went here and I grabbed a counter seat. Service was slow, but that was fine because I wanted to see how big the portions were before ordering. Ordered eggs, bacon, home fries and coffee. No complaints on food or size of portions served. Next time I am back in city I would like to try something from the non breakfast portion of the menu rather than a bland buffet."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Well worth the wait and the portions were generous. Hopefully it doesn't take me 12 more years to return!"}
{"text":"Now, this is a true Las Vegas gem! I would try and describe the 70's throw-back swingers club vibe this place has to offer, but you'd truly have to see it for yourself. 

Great drinks, comfy lounge seating, music videos on the tvs, beautiful cocktail waitresses in long black gowns, fire pits, super-sized drinks, good bar food, and a truly unique atmosphere all combine to make this place one of my favorite bars in vegas. 

If you are visiting, you got to check it out. If you're local, you already know. :)"}
{"text":"pretty decent for brunch, had the maserati omelet, not bad.  
$10-14 most plates, BIG shareable portions..."}
{"text":"My wife and l don't get to vegas often. We ventured in and the interior and music playing is straight out the eighties. The eighties is my decade and i was hearing songs I've haven't in ages. The food was great the blueberry muffins that came with the munich omelette was hot and great. The portions were enough for 2 or 3 people. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. Eating at the peppermill was a great start to day"}
{"text":"This is the cherry on top of all-night escapades in Vegas. Ginormous portions. Neon blue & pink lights. Faux cherry blossom trees. What's not to love?

I dug this place so much, I ate here twice. The vodka in my system always craves breakfast. So that's what I ordered. Big ass omelets. The largest omelets you can feast your eyeballs on. Ditto on the cobb salads. And most likely everything else on the menu for that matter. 

Know what that means? Extras for tomorrow! Scoreeee."}
{"text":"It was a great place for breakfast I was turned on couple years about this place every time I come to Vegas I have breakfast here so please try it it's out of this world the corn beef hash is the killer enjoy stop and see the girls are beautiful"}
{"text":"Interesting decor.  Fireside lounge is cool concept. Huge portion of food, sliders was good but the chips were terrible"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the first time I ever visited Vegas. The vibe is mellow and cool. After a night of dancing, drinking, and walking the fire pits are great to relax by. The food hits the spot! We ordered standard breakfast (eggs, bacon, hash browns) and the Peppermill Burger. They did not disappoint. The service is always great. The owner/manager is so nice. This is a must-do whenever you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"So, have you ever been so hungry you needed two onions worth of onion rings? How about a salad the size of your head? Or for the finale, pancakes that hang off all edges of your plate? 

Peppermill is definitely for the Adam Richman (Man Vs. Food host) in all of us. One would think with quantity, quality suffers but Peppermill definitely proves that adage wrong. Me and my sis always order pancakes, bacon, and the fruit&granola bowl: all are fantastic. The fruit&granola bowl is about the size of 2 banana splits. Pancakes are HUGE, over 12\" in diameter (at least) with a fluffy sweetness to them that beg for just a tiny amount of syrup when you dress them with the AWESOME \"stripper\" sugar sprinkles.

I definitely love this place. The blue neon and comfortable seating and long raised walkways turned into foliage.........somehow makes me believe Peppermill used to be a strip club in a former life.......but who knows ;-). 

Service is great here: quick, friendly, and very personable. It's reassuring to know that in a city built on transient party goers, at a place centered on the strip, people still remember your name.

Give this place a try."}
{"text":"This is an \"Old Faithful\"of Vegas that has stood the test of time. Menu is massive. Breakfast & sandwiches are their strong suit, Yummy & huge. Omelettes & pancakes are very good. I think they use a whole carton of eggs for an omelette, not kidding. There is a seperate bar (to the left of entry)that is quite unique..it has a circular sunken area that faces a crystal fire pit. There are also several tvs ,in case you dont find the array of characters (fellow patrons)entertaining. Their cocktail menu (extensive-frozen drinks,etc)& bar food menu is pretty good,  something for everyone, as well as virgin cocktails too.. This is a place to people watch as it is open 24 hours & anyone who knows Vegas, knows the Peppermill. Very good diner food for all ages.  Depending on time of day or night, there may be entertaining drunken party stragglers trying to sober up with a meal. It is a good size restaurant however, maintaining order & comfort for their patrons. Spend the extra $ & skip IHop & come here. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, large amount of good food, friendly staff, and multi-games at the bar!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times as it is a Vegas Staple...but the food and service are always \"meh\".  It isn't horrible, but isn't really good either.  Basically  Denny's with a really good interior designer.  The drinks at the Fireside lounge aren't bad, but a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"As always, it's all Vegas! As a local we enjoy it for breakfast anytime the strip isn't busy. Fantastic breakfast with huge portions.  Always crowded but their great service gets you in and out quickly without feeling rushed. Great menu choices.  I'm sure with the taste and quality of breakfast, their lunch and dinners are great too."}
{"text":"24Hr diner with decor of a strip club. It is however, a good place to stop if you're looking for a decent meal at late hours. 

The service is quite fast and there is quite a few options to choose from. At 3AM I opted for a cup of coffee and \"Joe's San Francisco Special.\" Basically, thats a few eggs, spinach, onions, ground beef & sausage, and topped with cheese sauce. Originally it includes hash browns mixed in there but I asked for them to set that aside since I wasn't so sure I wanted to eat them. You do get an option of toast but I chose to try their warm blueberry muffin! I'm so glad I went with that because it was the best part of the entire meal.  

The prices for breakfast are along the lines as a typical diner such as Norms or Denny's but their plates are much much larger here. Honestly, if you were to split a plate with someone, I think you would be better off. 

The coffee was watered down but then again if they're making so much of it, I can imagine this is not their main concern.

Good place to get a bite to eat if you're not in the mood to be picky. I can see how this place gets crowded after-hours as the \"meet up spot.\""}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places. It's old Vegas. It's fun, bright and cheery. The wait is usually long, but that's to be expected and not a deal breaker for me. We usually go for breakfast. The pancakes are to die for!"}
{"text":"Have eaten for over 20 years, and enjoyed it everytime. Breakfast or lunch, weekdays or weekends, its great! I visit Vegas 5+ times a year and have to stop each and everytime. Jennifer Martin, our waitress is always professional and fun. She has a great laugh and smile. Ask for her if you can, you wont be dissappointed."}
{"text":"***Disclaimer*** Their portions are HUGE!!! Beware! 

LOL!

We were there for dinner: 

We had the Peppermill Breakfast... 3 eggs, bacon and sausage with 3 pancakes. Sooooo good! Couldn't finish the pancakes are about 1 only lol 

Hubby has a burger with onion rings... He loved it!

Everything was GREAT!
--------------------------------------------------------

Following day (morning) we both ordered breakfast: 

I ordered the French toast combo with 3 eggs, sausage and bacon with aside of hash browns. Loved it!!! The French toast was fluffy and not too eggy. Perfect! 

Hubby ordered the Peppermill Breakfast and same thing too much food. He was only able to eat 2 pancakes. Eggs were cooked perfect for him, he likes his eggs over hard and everywhere else he orders them like that he gets them with the yolk still runny. Not here, they cooked them well and perfect. 

This is our spot every time we are out here in Vegas! And will continue to be forever! 

The servers are very attentive every time we visit! That right there deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"one of my favorite places to go...perfect to take someone from tinder when u want to make out with them while they are eating mozzarella sticks lol but no really i always have a good time here and its so relaxed."}
{"text":"First time here and will be coming back for sure. The portions are HUGE and staff is very attentive and friendly. The ambiance is very intimately-casual? it's cool to have TREES and lights while dining - there are even complimentary photos! (not sure if this is a daily thing or just on Friday when we went at like 3am)

I got the Peppermill Pastrami Burger and wow. Fresh, cooked well, and they had onion rings as a side option at no extra charge! Onion rings are my favorite kind of rings. They were crunchy and the onion did not slide out when you take a bite. That's a sign of a good ring! The burger was tasty and not overly salty. Pastrami tends to be salty and I was afraid it would be too much, but it was seasoned well and really good. Would eat again!

My partner got the french dip and I only to try one bite because he devoured it. Very flavorful au jus and if my love for onion rings wasn't so strong - I would get the potato salad. Flavorful and fresh tasting. It wasn't heavy like some potato salad can be. It was a cool contrast to the hot sandwich. 

Overall, great dining experience and will be here time and time again for late night eats. But might share a plate next time - the portions are very generous. They also have a cool lounge attached to the restaurant. Poked my head in and it looked like a chill place to hang out."}
{"text":"We saw this place on one of those food network shows .thought it would be amazing was very very disappointed.Hello I had some staple food Philly cheesesteak 'Subway has a better one '
My wife had pastrami it was like sandwich meat from prepackaged foods Sorry but I do not recommend !!!!!"}
{"text":"This place screamed the bird cage (movie) and the lounge looked like it had once been a strip club with it's vintage Vegas ambiance which made it all that more fun for us tourists.

We enjoyed breakfast here on our way outta town this week after it came HIGHLY recommended by our hotel's front desk.

We got there before most of Vegas woke up (10am) and therefore missed a massive line but still had to wait about 15 minutes. 

We choose to hang in the lounge for a bit where we sat on plush, fuzzy couches and some of the best honey roasted peanuts I've ever had!?!

Breakfast was decently priced, the portions were HUGE and the service was friendly and our someone difficult orders were 100% accurate.

If it weren't for the $15 RT cab ride from our hotel, this place would be our usual go to from now on."}
{"text":"After a very long night, Elizabeth D. and i wake up and crawl into a cab. its about 3:30pm and we ask the cabbie where we can get a good breakfast. he says \"the Peppermill is pretty good\"

PRETTY GOOD?! This place is amazing. We didnt know what hit us, it was like our dreamland come true, except for all the smoke. yuck.

anyhoo, we shared the Fantasia waffle with sour cream (definitely the way to go) and the best biscuits and gravy that we had ever encountered in our entire lives.

The bloody mary would have been delicious if the celery stick wasnt monstrous and made every sip taste like i was actually taking a bite.

sooooo, after our meal we decided to check out the fireside lounge.  The fire pits in a hot tub? could this get any better?

the next day we dragged our tired asses and our friends back to our found treasure for our last meal in town. too bad i was hung over and threw up everything i ate on the way home : (  soooo worth it"}
{"text":"The wait is definitely worth it here! Had the Chorizo and eggs and I DO NOT regret it! Lovveeeee it!"}
{"text":"We literally come here every chance we get when we are in town. The food is so good and consistent and the atmosphere is amazing. Jame the bartender in the lounge was so friendly and made the best drinks we had all weekend!! We can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Awesum mushroom burger!!  We ate here 4 times in 12 days. Very comfortable inside!! Nachos are enormous!"}
{"text":"Great place for a drink, especially on a cold night! Cozy bar area, but has a decent dining area as well. Love it here!"}
{"text":"21 years I've been here and finally checked this place out. Wasn't disappointed. Great lounge for relaxed conversating. Nice mood set by the neon. Fire pits were a nice touch. Drink prices were good. Friendly waitress. Will have to check out the food next time."}
{"text":"Wasn't my first choice, just became the most convenient option before beginning the long drive home.

Have to admit, I was quite pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  We had 2 sandwiches and both were huge portions (if anyone knows me, they know if I say they are huge...they are) and delicious.  we had a hot pastrami sandwich and a french dip with straight horseradish.  Home made onion rings and a delicious red potato salad completed the meal....wasn't exactly ready for a 5 hour drive after we finished...a nap would have been preferred...but i was due at work in 6 hours haha

Service was friendly and efficient refilling my coffee about a zillion times in preparation for the drive"}
{"text":"Very old school feel not glitzy and new. Expect to wait for a table, and they are open 24 hours. Food is good with large portion sizes. Service was decent. Love the tree in the middle of the restaurant. Menu has plenty of tasty choices. Check it out at least once. I would return."}
{"text":"I seriously had high hopes for this place. Everyone and their momma's baby's daddy's first cousin kept saying how good the food was; like toe curling good(allegedly). So my traveling buddy and I decided to get a early breakfast here after a night of debauchery on the strip. The restaurant had a late 80's Magnum PI type vibe going with the decor. I could dig it. It was cute. We were seated and promptly given menus. I ordered a typical breakfast(scrambled eggs and pancakes, hash browns). My traveling partner ordered  steak, eggs, and hash browns. Our food came out in a timely manner and the portions were more than sufficient, but when I say those were the gummiest eggs I have ever tasted..... babeee, terrible. I really don't want to believe they were powered but those couldn't have been fresh or the hen was past her prime. The pancakes were equally eek and they felt like bricks hitting the bottom of my stomach, just heavy and tasteless no matter how mud I tried to make them edible, I just gave up.

My buddy was a little indisposed( i.e a little hammered), so she actually didn't eat her steak until the next day, but she said it was delicious!. I don't know, maybe I just had a one off night and maybe if I got back, I will give Peppermill another try, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent and so was the ambience. The waiting staff was excellent as well. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for meals in vegas. Breakfast all the time but the place is upbeat and alive with great food that comes out fast and is good to eat. The portions are enormous so come hungry. Bagels don't expect New York but the rest is top of the line. Love the sour dough myself. Ambience is adult but fun."}
{"text":"DO NOT USE YOU DEBIT CARD HERE!!!! The food was ok. My daughter and I had cheeseburgers. They were just ok. They came out on plain toasted bread. After the first bite the bread fell apart. They were not work $15 each! My husband had the $20 chicken fried steak dinner. The vegetables were bland as hell.  Sooooo not work the money. We went here the first day we arrived in Las Vegas. We stayed and played for 4 days. THREE WEEKS LATER OUR DEBIT CARD WAS CHARGED FROM THIS RESTAURANT!!!! Seriously....three weeks later! I will never eat here again. The food was mediocre, the service was ok and it took three weeks to charge our card! We went here because they were on the Food Network. We were very disappointed. We ended up spending $65 for food, drinks and taxes"}
{"text":"This was our first time at the Peppermill and we were NOT disappointed. The service was excellent, Elisha was our server and she was very nice and quick. We were a group of 8 with a 10 month old baby and all the orders were correct and brought out very quickly. 
They have a big selection of breakfast plates and ALL the food that we ordered was excellent. It was also very well priced. 

I will definitely go back to eat there when I'm in Las Vegas and I would gladly reccomend it to anybody!"}
{"text":"Very good but a little pricey though. The fire in the bar area is very cool though. The food is good. Very nice place"}
{"text":"First off, please know that the Peppermill will almost always be packed when you visit. You will probably always have a wait if you want to sit down and dine. Lucky for you, there is an actual LOUNGE (with actual FIRE) off to the side of the host's kiosk. Go in there after you give your name, and enjoy a drink while you wait. Otherwise you'll be crammed up against Martha from Sheboygan and her husband, Herb, who lost a little too much at the penny slots and are throwing elbows and creating their own line for the counter spots (they're first come, first serve).

Portions are ginromous. Food is All-American. Haute cuisine, this is not, but satisfying to the American palate, it is.

Decor is fun, and this place is just kind of a fun gimmick. If you've got a tourist friend (or you are a tourist), looking for a \"gosh, that's fun\" kind of dining experience, then this is it. Think of it as an electric carnival 80s neon Denny's on acid."}
{"text":"A throwback to another time, this bar is a blast! The sunken fire pit and mirrored walls are straight from the 60's/70's. Food is great, good service. get off the strip and try this place with your friends!"}
{"text":"What a fun place!! Cool decor and great food! Would be 5 stars but -1 for the service at the front area.  Had an hour wait on a Saturday but took longer because the receptionist forgot to call out our name.... Not sure why.

We hung out in the bar area for drinks and enjoyed the inside fire place.

When we finally got to the food, we ordered an omelette and steak/eggs.  Everything was really well seasoned and huge portions for the price.  5 stars for all of the food.  Must go! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good food and customer service! Come hungry as the portions are huge! The restaurant had that old Vegas feel,"}
{"text":"Portions here are crazy and the food was amazing great price you might want to call ahead and see how busy it is though you might have to wait around a bit other than that the food was amazing"}
{"text":"This place is the best.  Spectacular old school beverages and an very relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great menu with lots of variety and backed up with good quality food and service. A great place to stop at any time of the day or night in Sin City."}
{"text":"The experience was amazing.. food was great.. portions were big.. service was good.. had a very cool vibe from the time we walked in.. was amused by the fact there's 3 different people serving you, one guy for regular drinks, one girl for food, and a cocktail waitress.. will for sure be back.."}
{"text":"This rating is on the Lounge only as we did not eat.  It does not look like much from the outside, but the inside of the lounge is WAY cool!  Quiet, dark, not smoky, great service, cool fire pit.  Very nice place to escape from the strip."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place while staying at the hilton grand vacations. Who knew it was a top breakfast spot!!! The line can get crazy so get here early. Huge portions and great service"}
{"text":"\"Fireside Lounge\"

I absolutely love this place and no visit to Vegas is complete without it. Obviously, I can't give it higher than three stars because it's so cheesy, but I still love it. You enter through a standard diner (with pretty good cholesterol-heavy food) into a pink-and-blue-neon low-ceilinged room with a fire pit in the center. It's like passing from \"Alice\" into \"Fantasy Island\" to complete the '80s feel. I will give them points for the place always seeming very clean even though it's cluttered and hasn't been updated in an age (which is sort of the point). The plastic flower garland hanging everywhere isn't dusty and the cocktail servers in long black skirts slit up to the ying-yang are busy polishing the brass railings and plumping the cushions when not bringing drinks. The drinks aren't very good and tend to the sweet side on the cocktail menu. Hilariously, when I was last there, my buddy ordered a gin & tonic and the waitress asked, \"Would you like olives with that?\" He was a bit taken aback, but said, \"No, typically it comes with a twist. Gin and tonic, right?\" The waitress acknowledged the order and when she went to the bar, he turned to me and said, \"I will bet you money I'm about to get a gin martini.\" Sure enough, he got a giant glass of gin with a twist of lemon it in. Thus was born the new drink, a Gin & Tonic-Hold the Tonic. This was a pretty basic fail, but it only makes you love the place more. It's kind of like your slightly mentally-challenged child--you can't help but have affection despite its issues.

Sour note: Since smoking is allowed, when there are various trolls puffing away at the bar, the low ceilings can make the smoke pretty oppressive."}
{"text":"My wife and I were staying at the Palazzo and wanted to get lunch away from the busiest part of the Strip. We heard that the Peppermill was a great place to go, so we decided to check it out.

There was about a twenty minute wait, so we went outside and walked around for a while. When we got back, there was only one table ahead of us and we were seated shortly after. 

The decor of the restaurant is truly unique. It felt like we were at a special event. That feeling was supported by the fact that someone was walking around taking commemorative pictures for each table. 

The menu was quite extensive and everything looked enticing. To help with our decision making, we looked around the restaurant at what order people had ordered. This did not help in the slightest as all of the food looked delicious and the portions were colossal. 

We ultimately chose an order of buffalo wings, gyros, onions rings, and three fried eggs. All of the food was really tasty. The wings were gigantic and had the perfect amount of heat to them. The gyro meat was flavorful and the pita bread was nicely toasted. The onion rings were piping hot and not greasy. Even though we were really hungry, we were still unable to eat all of our food due to the large portion size. 

While the food, service, and ambience were top notch, I am going to deduct a star for not accepting credit cards. Las Vegas isn't some small town in the middle of nowhere. There is no excuse to be cash only in 2017. We would have ordered drinks too if I wasn't capped by the cash in my wallet. 

Overall though, the Peppermill is a great place to eat and is well worth the trip to the north of the Strip."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and decor of this place. It reminds me of times past. The food is sometimes not great and service can be slow but overall it's not bad."}
{"text":"Awesome retro decor!  We ordered the Lorraine omelet, hash browns, blueberry muffin,  French toast, side of scrambled eggs & bacon.  Huge portions enough for two adults & two kids.  Everything was served hot and quick!  We are coming here again!"}
{"text":"If you're primary concern if value for money, look no further. Portions are huge, prices are not. The food is delicious. I had the Peppermill Omelet with extra avocado and a bagel with cream cheese and jam. All of it was very good. My fiancé had the Pancake Combo and liked it a lot. Pancakes are enormous. Great place for cheap and good traditional breakfast. The atmosphere is also pretty cool. Service is great."}
{"text":"Love the Peppermill! 

I love the old school vibe of the Fireside lounge, it is not a pounding music blaring nightclub, its a place to hang out enjoy a drink in a comfy booth and still have a conversation or cuddle!

Hubby and I enjoyed a cocktail and appetizer platter was way more food then we could eat as a midnight snack!

Loved the Watatini (watermelon martini) very yummy! can't wait to go back and try all the rest!

Yes for the 20 something set it may seem old or not the \"in\" thing but we think its a great place for a date or a nice evening with your sweetie!"}
{"text":"i came here for the brunch...the place was quite unique...i like their fireside lounge because of the design and i have never seen before..the food was average..i ordered the egg bennedict and the joe special something....

CONCLUSION = RECOMMENDED!!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas. Diner style seating and neon lights almost feels like you're at a strip club while I'm killing the biscuits & gravy. Whether it's up early because I'm at a work conference in Vegas or because I just got done on the strip, I love me some Peppermill!"}
{"text":"We love the food and the portions are huge but it can get pretty busy which has lead to slow service... still a great 24/7 breakfast place and very convenient. There is counter seating which may be first come, first serve but the retro round booths are pretty cool."}
{"text":"hugest portions of food i have ever ever seen.

my ger-ger and i are big eaters
we ordered nachos for appetizer and 2 margaritas.
we barely finished the nachos.  being korean and jewish, we feel too guilty wasting food.  they were delicious!

we were too full to order dinner or dessert.

we'll have to come back for our intended dinner entrees next time in vegas!"}
{"text":"A large group of us dined at the Peppermill for brunch while we were in town celebrating my husband's 50th birthday. We had an issue with one of our orders and the manager, Peggy, was very accommodating. She went above and beyond to enhance our experience and make sure we were satisfied. Our group truly appreciated her efforts. Peggy is awesome! We also had a fantastic waitress, but unfortunately can't recall her name. She was very sweet, helpful and got all of our complicated orders correct! We'll definitely be back during our future visits to Vegas. Thanks Peggy! We appreciate you"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here since I was a child, and was pretty disappointed. The atmosphere and decor is very cool and retro! But, there were drunk people passed out in the booth next to me(kick them out?) and I was served coffee in a mug with red lipstick all around the rim. The food was good, kind of like a Dennys to be honest. It took almost 30 minutes to get my check when asking for it multiple times. All in all it was okay but I see no reason to come back."}
{"text":"We stopped here before we headed back home and we are glad we did as the restaurant holds up to its reputation.  My husband had fish and chips and I had the Reuben.  Both were excellent and huge servings.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant was built in the early 70s and has a retro disco like atmosphere that includes stained glass chandeliers with flamingos on them .  Be sure to check out the bar too, which has comfy sofas and fire pits to sip drinks around.  We loved this place and will be sure to make it our Vegas tradition."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go after everywhere else has closed down, sit around the indoor fires, and get weird with some random people sharing the booth with you.  Don't be fooled by going into the diner side, go to the bar side.  A Vegas classic that exemplifies what Vegas was like before $22 martinis and hipsters.  Long live the Peppermill."}
{"text":"You know if the lounge had someone in a sequin dress doing coke off one of the tables the feel of a 70's disco would have been dead on and that's not a bad thing. I loved the decor  it was clean we had one issue with a very confused server and the waitress went above and beyond to resolve it. 

The food was good and cooked as ordered and there was plenty of it, good service which is to be expected everywhere else, but this is Vegas where people go to dieThe Peppermill however is staffed by vibrant attentive staff. 

If you go spend some time in the lounge if you're too young see why the 70's were so strange if you're old enough you can revisit what you forgot in the booze coked filled era and relish that you made it out alive."}
{"text":"As a group sales manager from a neighboring hotel property who would often refer my guest to what I would describe as hidden Las Vegas gem, I am disgusted by the way I was treated by the manager Marie. She was rude and not customer service oriented when I had brought visiting family members in for dinner this evening. After spending a hefty bill bringing in a party of 8. To start one meal was about 20 min late to the table after everyone else had received their entree. Which was fine when the waitress returned several times and insisted the meal would be right out. At the conclusion of dinner the bill was presented at a certain amount. When at the cash registered the total amount then jumped significantly. They explained the late meal was never added to the check and that was the increase in price (indicating the meal was never sent to the kitchen, if that was the case the server should have honestly communicated and we would have canceled the meal.) nonetheless Marie the manager was a total bitch and insisted we pay which we did. With the way we were treated management at the Peppermill can count on never getting another referral from myself of my staff in the future! #somuchforalasvegasgem

{"text":"Gotta love this place.

Where else at 4am after a night of drunken debauchery can you go and eat onion rings and/or pancakes? The food is what you would expect, diner style. I love the retro neon decor and the service is always good, in particular the waitress Dallas. For some reason I always seemed to end up in her section, which is awesome. Ive never been to the lounge side but Ive never really had a need to... perhaps one day.

Great place, I hope it continues to run strong for several more decades and not give in to the corporate sprawl of the strip."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Our waiter took forever to come to our table upon being seated. The picture girl took our picture, edited and brought it back to us to purchase and the waiter still hadn't showed up. Once he finally showed up, we ordered and we were very disappointed. The food was very mediocre, but I must say, the cocktails were pretty good. This place needs a serious makeover from the staff, to the decor, on down to the menu."}
{"text":"Lots of people in line but we were seated within a good time the food was great the service was excellent"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast - crowded but got a table in the time they said - wonderful waitress and the omelette and scrambles were good portions and reasonable in price!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. It was my first time visiting this restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised :) the atmosphere was retro and cool . When you walk in he hostess takes your name down and invites you to wait in a lounge (where I enjoyed a mimosa ) which has a really cool water/fire pit and music videos playing on flat screens above it ... so freaking cool!! We were called to our table shortly after and he restaurant was just as amazing , the ceiling and parts of the walls are lined with neon , the ceiling appears to be made of like disco ball material , there are these really  cool trees in areas of the restaurant , rainbow sugar , bomb food ... I can go on and on this place is a must try if your ever in the area. Food and ambiance was on point , loved this place ! 
I had the pepermill pancake combo, it's a large dish by you won't be disappointed, it comes
With a side of eggs ( in a separate dish , loved !)  two sausage links and two pieces of bacon and of course a stack of three fluffy delicious pancakes with a side of maple  syrup. It was sooo good! I will come again for sure !"}
{"text":"Big portions of delicious food, 24 hours, awesome throw-back ambiance... what more do you want?  It's always busy so be prepared to wait.  I try not to leave without having the mud pie... bring a friend or two!"}
{"text":"I was lucky that my new local friends pointed me to this spot.

This is old Las Vegas.. tacky to the max with the neon colors in the napkins, décor, etc.  I loved it.  There is a cocktail waitress who served good Bloody Mary's (heard the mimosas weren't that good).. and the food was large in portion but in my opinion.. not as good as Hash A Go Go.  Hash Browns were incredibly crispy and delicious.

The most amazing part is the fireside lounge where it's a round lounge around a fire that's on water.  It's truly amazing and reminds me of what a backroom of a strip club would look like if I were to go to those in Vegas (I haven't although I tried to once.. I swear!)

Great spot to visit... 3.5 stars.  Free parking and gladly it is not on the Strip with all the terrible parking and traffic."}
{"text":"Um, yuck. First, let me say that I don't like diner food, I detest \"breakfast\" foods (pancakes, waffles, maple syrup, sausages, etc.: OMG vom) and \"traditional\" \"American\" food barely qualifies as food IMO. (Pizza, burgers and chow mein: now THAT's American! Meatloaf and steak & eggs: ICK!) So to say that this is not the place for me is an understatement. It IS, however, open 24/7 and near-ish my hotel.

First trip: I ordered fettucine alfredo with shrimp. The portion size was not as big as a lot of places, but that's OK because it was gross. The sauce was gummy and didn't taste fresh, the few shrimp were large, but a little tough, and the noodles were not what you'd call al dente. The garlic bread with \"cheese\" on it was revolting.
My mum ordered the Chicken & Red Pepper Pasta. Hers was better than mine, though her penne was also overcooked. The sauce was pretty good, the red pepper strips were, I swear, Mezetta brand right out of the jar (but I like those), and they were right on the money when they described it as chicken stuffed with herbs and cream cheese; it tasted just like Philadelphia Cooking Creme Italian Cheese & Herb flavour.
Second trip: I ordered New York steak and Shrimp Scampi. I ordered it cooked medium, it was definitely well done. The shrimp were, too. My mother ordered some icky breakfast foods, so I didn't taste them, but she said they were OK.
I think if you like breakfast foods (served all day) and diner food, you'll like this place, but I will avoid it. The waitresses were cute and helpful, though. And the decor is amusing."}
{"text":"if you want large portions, this is your place!  The neon was about as cheesy as it gets, which I loved!  

If you have a hard time making decisions (like me), this place can be overwhelming because the menu is HUGE.

The hash browns....wow! yum!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great. The portions are Hugh! The service is the best."}
{"text":"This is apparently part of Vegas history.  It is retro meets Rainforest Cafe except the food is really good.  I had the crab cake Benedict's with hash browns.  It was surprisingly good! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Haven't been here yet but if it would be like the one in Reno Nevada it's got to be great I'll let you know sometime soon"}
{"text":"I have been here about three times with friends and my child and then I have been here with a film crew the desert portions are a gigantic I think everything is gigantic but it's definitely a mix of a tourist trap and locals who like to sit by the fire in the separate room the service is very good parking is never a problem and this place has a good reputation since it's been there for
A really long time it's a Vegas favourite
It is open 24 hours and I have tried multiple things at multiple times so I can't remember much of anything particular I have some pictures that I can upload
But I would have to dig for them I know there's many film crews that's that by this place so don't be surprised if you see a camera someplace"}
{"text":"Meh is the best way I can think of to describe this place. Had breakfast here last Sunday because I wanted to reminisce early visits to Vegas when I would stay on the north end of the strip and ate here.

Now I remember why I only ate at Peppermill a couple of times. WAAAAYYY!!! overpriced. Food was so so, service was ok but none of it was worth the money. I only went here to avoid stuffing myself at the buffets!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went here in the recommendation of a friend. Loved the retro decor. Food was good and portions were very generous. Cups of coffee were much larger than your average diner and better quality too. Heard the servers sing happy birthday in an interesting way a couple of times. Neat place that I'm sure I'd come back to."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that are busy just because it's 24hrs, the food is very bland my sister and I had two different dishes and neither had any flavor I probably won't go back"}
{"text":"It's a romantic timewarp!  The firey pits (see photo) are really cool and the decor is 70's all the way.  It's a nice change of pace from the rest of the strip."}
{"text":"When my friends and I went to Las Vegas, we were told we had to go the Peppermill for the best breakfast in Las Vegas. I couldn't agree more. We went for breakfast and had only a 20 minute wait, which we enjoyed by sipping Bloody Marys in the Fireside Lounge. 

Vegas is the place for excess and the Peppermill abides by that spirit. The menu sports 10-egg omelettes and a 22-oz milkshake. I thought the Peppermill had an excellent selection of food. While not unique, the menu was extensive and has all the staples. The food was good and the prices were quite reasonable for Las Vegas. It's definitely a Vegas must-do."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. The food was amazing, can't wait to come again. And my Bloody Mary was yummy!"}
{"text":"Always awesome no matter what time of day or night. Perfect old fashion favorite. Hope it always stays the same. But it is Vegas"}
{"text":"Ok, so the food is a 3 to be honest. A solid 3 though. The kind you aren't going to remember per se but it hit the spot. That being said the experience and fun that screams old world Vegas makes it a 5. I feel like I've transcended time and get a taste of how my favorite city felt back in its glory days. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow,  five stars all the way.  Hint if its just two of you,  it's first come first serve at the counter.   We saved  45 min of waiting. The food is amazing,  at least the French Toast ambrosia.  You think okay french toast with fruit and whipped cream,  no big deal,  but then you add bosenberry syrup,  OMG you have heaven in your mouth.   The servings are huge if you order most bread products,  french toast, pancakes, you are going to want to share those or take home half. We will be back for the fireside lounge too."}
{"text":"The Peppermill feels like a truly Las Vegas experience! Anyplace else in the world and this place would be quite out of place but in LV, it's freaking perfect! Neon all over the place and kitschy as hell! (In a good way) I know all the reviews talk about this but I can't stress this enough: the portions are huge!! If you're like me and like to have leftovers, by all means get a plate just for yourself and unless you're Joey Chestnut or Adam Richman, you can expect more than enough for another full meal at home. If you're a tourist though and won't be taking a doggie bag, please do yourself a favor and share a plate with your partner so there won't be so much food wasted. The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the waitress, although friendly, just wasn't super attentive. That being said, I'd definitely come back and would most likely bring a date because this restaurant/lounge is just too kitschy/glitzy/vegasy (is that a word?) not to love."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast our first day in Vegas and were VERY happy. The portions are large, the food was very good, and the prices aren't too bad. If I return to Vegas, I definitely want to come back and try dinner / drinks."}
{"text":"Perfect diner for a late night snack. Great huge portions right on the Strip. Saw one guy eat a chicken fried mozzarella steak hero sandwich with onion rings tooth picked into the top. Five minutes into it, his eyeballs turned white with 3 sevens across them. He fell out of the booth and yelled, \"I just paid off!\" That's a late night Vegas diner, baby."}
{"text":"If I could leave this place no stars, I would.

For starters, the \"greeters\" were gossiping when we walked in, and halfway acknowledged us as they led us to our table. I realize they frequently have drunk people coming in after bars let out (2am-6am ish) but it's midnight and we are sober.

Our waitress was friendly, but couldn't tell me what percentage of fat was in the ground beef they use for the burgers. The cook went to the back and read the box, and said it was 75% fat. Haha, ok. That doesn't exist in real life, so I asked the waitress if she could please check, even though I correctly suspected they meant 25% fat. The kitchen staff appeared to be overly annoyed that I even asked, let alone requested a second look. Excuse me for caring about what I put into my body. At any rate, 75/25 chuck? Not exactly what I was expecting based on their trumped-up description on their menu.

I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and sweet potato fries. It was good, until a large glob of what appeared to be someone's spit dripped out of the bottom of my wrap. My stomach turned and I couldn't eat another bite. I felt like vomiting as I used the wooden skewer to inspect the substance on the edge of my plate, which clearly was not a food product. Yep, definitely spit. Thankfully I spotted it before I bit into that area of the wrap!!!

I told the waitress, and she tried her best to act surprised. She told the manager, who came over to defend her staff, and tell me over and over \"they don't do that\" there. Right. Angry employees spit in food everyday in all types of restaurants. The manager offered something else (no thanks, don't need more spat-upon dishes). But, she didn't seem apologetic, nor was she able to explain what it was, if not spit. What ingredient in a grilled buffalo chicken wrap is the consistency and color of someone's nasal drip? None.

Nothing more was said, they just removed it from the bill. I will absolutely never return, and I will vehemently steer friends away from this place.

If you are starving and this is the only thing open, just go to bed hungry."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I have ever been to the Peppermill and unfortunately I was very disappointed. Especially because my friends talked so highly of this place.

First we checked out the Fireside Lounge and it was happy hour. My friends and I ordered the famous Scorpion drink and MAN it was super strong! For our appetizers we ordered crab cakes, shrimp cocktail and chips and salsa.  The crab cakes could have been better. To me there was really no flavor to them. 

After hanging out in the Fireside lounge we went over to grab something to eat for dinner. We got fettuccine Alfredo, shrimp scampi Acapulco, and pork loin and eggs. My boyfriend and I were very disappointed with our food. My shrimp scampi wasn't good at all. So bland.

All in all, I don't think I'll ever come back for the food but definitely for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"The Fireside Lounge is a cool place to hang out. I was craving a Bloody Mary so we stopped in for some drinks. Their Bloody Mary's were pretty good! Definitely enjoyed the atmosphere to go with it. Watching 90's music videos by the fireside was pretty sweet too! 

We came back the next day for some more drinks (it is Vegas afterall!) and some food. The Hawaiian Mimosas were amazing! Not sure if they were worth $10, considering you don't get much. After we got our drinks we waited for a table for about 30 minutes. Once we sat down we were greeted by our waitress, who started off very attentive and then soon disappeared until our check was delivered. I ordered the eggs benedict which were very mediocre. My friend ordered a corned beef egg dish that was also relatively bland. 

Overall, food was nothing special, drinks were pretty good, and atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"Came here during mid August during the weekend and it was packed. Even though it was completely packed they say you down quickly and the service was faster than in other places with a fifth of the people. Food was also good and portions were very generous."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Go!!! We were quoted 1.5 hour wait. Took an hour, but time fly by eating tasty appetizers and drinking great drinks in the lounge. Service was top notch and the food was great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are still talking about our Valentine's Day breakfast . . . not only was the service great, but the food was delicious! 

Approximately 8:30am we went to have a celebratory breakfast. When you walk in, the lights are dimmed, lots of teal/pink/purple colors. Cool vibe. 
And I have to add, the music selection was fantastic!!

I ordered the Eggs Benedict: 3 eggs over two English muffins, Canadian bacon, and smothered with a flavorful, rich, hollandaise sauce. Golden brown, crispy hash browns served on the side. 

My husband ordered the New York Steak and eggs: 3 eggs (he ordered over-easy), perfectly charred Med-Rare steak grilled with hash browns on the side. He chose a toasted English muffin on the side. 

To drink, I had a spicy dbl Bloody Mary, and my hubby had a dbl vodka soda. Good pours and yummy

The bill came to $65.81. Certainly not the cheapest breakfast in town, but the large portions, ambiance, and great service was without a doubt worth it!

Overall, it exceeded our expectations and we can't wait to try lunch and dinner next."}
{"text":"Decor: Neon lights made me feel like I was dining in a disco bar. 

I had great memories of the muffins and the Rueben at peppermill that I had to come back. We arrived around 11 and were seated right away. This lady jacked us for $10 saying she would give us a free postcard photo. The photo on the postcard was hella small, so we had to buy the bigger version for $10. Mom and I split a Rueben (salty and too much bread) and bran muffins which were most excellent. Dad said the egg Benedict sucked, and bf said his omelette was really heavy and just ok. Maybe I will just picked up some muffins to go next time. By the time we left there was a line out the door!"}
{"text":"The bus ladies were super nice and one lady kept checking if everything was okay. Our server though didnt seem to care about us but only that we got our food and she got her money. The girl serving our drinks was always coming around asking if we wanted more. Theyre hawaiian sunset mimosas are delicious, but pricey. For 6 drinks it came out to about $60. The servings are big and satisfying. I loved my steak and eggs but couldnt finish them so I took it to go. The retro, old school Vegas theme is cool. I dont mind it. They were super busy during lunch but we didnt mind it as long as the drinks came coming in. The bathrooms were super clean and there was always someone there cleaning it. I would give it a 5 if it wasnt for our server."}
{"text":"Don't understand the rating for this place. Food was OK. Had the Crab cake benedict - a bit fishy, english muffin could be more crispy, hollandaise sauce was good. Bacon on the side - love mine extra crispy but the ones I had did not reach level of crispiness that I like."}
{"text":"Pastrami with hash browns... That is all. But really, everything here is amazing. Bomb diner food with that Vegas feel. You can't go wrong with whatever you order here. Please enjoy as its my favorite."}
{"text":"The \" Munchie's\" breakfast was really delicious and the pancakes are good as well, but beware because the pancakes are huge!! Sharing is definitely par for the course."}
{"text":"Love Neon lights while your dining?  Then you've come to the right spot.  First of all the portion size is big.  Sharing a meal would be a good idea or you'll need a wheel barrel out this place. 

I've only been here for breakfast whenever in Vegas.  It should be on your to go list-dining if your an out of towner.
The menu ha everything for everyone and the food is great.  
If you walk in and there's no wait then your lucky.  Otherwise expect to wait for a while.  
Ambience is unique and something Vegas offers no where else.  Polyester uniforms and shimmering tights for servers bring you back to 80's flashback.  
Nothing fancy just great grub. You won't regret it.  Enjoy!
Off to the next meal adventure my friend..."}
{"text":"I kind of felt like I was in an old mobster movie in Las Vegas. I loved the fire pit, experiencing that and being able to take pictures, I felt like a tourist attraction. The food was ok, not really what I expected. But it was tasty enough. The seating was a bit squashy, but we made do and the service was pretty good."}
{"text":"As Trump would put it, the peppermill portions are \"HUGE\". I got their corn beef and hash. It certainly hit the spot after a night of adult beverage consumption. But sadly, I could only finish less than half in one seating. 

Hubs got the ham plate and a side of pancakes. Even he could not finish half of his plate. The rest of the ham is sitting in my fridge as a leftovers. 

I love the ambiance of this place. It's quirky and fun. The wait goes fairly quickly so don't get discouraged of the waiting list."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of \"old time Vegas\"....and old time is 60's and 70's. I remember Las Vegas when it was an adult place to play and people dressed decently to go out for a special night. So I try to search for places that have been around for a while to get the same feel of what it was back then. They are there but you got to look hard to find them. 

The Peppermill is one of them...Great ambiance, good food, ample portions and very comfortable. The decor is flashy Vegas but really Kool.

If you are tired of the same old thing and eating at soulless hotel restaurants, coffee shops, Mickey d's and the like.....go here. It's fun, different and the food is good. And...Don't forget to visit the lounge!!"}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review since I've gone here 3 out of the 6 times I've been to Vegas in the past few years. It's a popular spot after partying for diner faire. Not much else to say. The service has always been friendly and fairly attentive, even when it's packed at 1-2 in the morning. Waters get filled. Missing silverware is replenished if need be. I get my Tabasco before my meal arrives. Seating isn't too big of an issue either. Parking seemed not be much of a challenge on the weekends either. Don't let the pricing scare you, if the menu said it's $12 for an omelette, you really do get $12 worth of omelette and sides. Not a bargain compared to some other deals around the strip, but it's okay. If I had a choice to skip out on this place late at night and go elsewhere, I wouldn't mind. A change of pace from \"tradition\" or a routine wouldn't hurt anyone, especially in Vegas. If my friends want to go here, I still don't mind.

As for the food you get, it's not bad. It hits the spot at that time of the night. Always good times to crowd around a booth with a bunch of your buddies just to recap your night of partying and tell stories over a meal. LIke I said, the portions are huge. Unfortunately, having left overs in the middle of a Vegas trip isn't such a great thing since most hotel rooms don't have a fridge, let alone a microwave to reheat your food. If you're a normal eater, sharing your plate with someone else might be a good idea. Or if you're drunk and starving, perfect! I like the fact that a bran muffin is a choice as far as toast/muffin/biscuit options go with your breakfast. I usually save the muffin for the next morning for those really slow starts to the day. You know how it is when you party in Vegas. Sleep late, wake up late. Eat a ....bran muffin with your complimentary hotel coffee?"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! Every time we go down to the strip I look forward to stopping by the Peppermill. This place has a nice, intimate, and relaxing atmosphere. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the parking could be better. Hey, it is downtown Vegas though what do I expect?! Hope you have a good time and good memories like I do if you decide to go here."}
{"text":"Ambiance is neat, but food was bland, cocktail waitress was pretty rude when we told her our Bloody Mary tasted like it had no alcohol in it.  Wouldn't advise getting any drinks with vodka in it. Our extra shot was cheap quality well liquor and didn't even help the drink."}
{"text":"You know what. There's really only one way to describe this place.

\"Upper class Denny's, good looking servers, and humungous portions\"

Seriously that is all that you need to know. The food portions here are so big that there is no way you cannot get full. You thought Denny's was good? Denny's can't even touch this. I'm not saying that it's the MOST delicious breakfast food I've eaten. What I am saying is that they will fill you until your gut explodes.

Oh one more thing. If you are hung over, go here for breakfast. Yup."}
{"text":"The ambiance is what I envision old Las Vegas to be - very casual/relaxed! We had the focaccia sandwich and the peppermill burger, and both were great! I highly recommend either. We also came a bit later in the evening so that we could enjoy their 9-11 happy hour, which has many options for food and drinks.

The staff was very friendly and helpful! I highly recommend stopping by if you're in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink late night on the strip. We hit the restaurants around 10PM and service fairly prompt given how busy the place was. We ordered the Eggs Benedict and roast beef sandwich. Both tasted great! I'd compare this place to an upscale Denny's with atmosphere and look (like many have already said) of a cruise liner. 

We did order a couple of drinks (which you must order from the cocktail waitress instead of your server for some reason) and they tasted great as well. (We ordered the 64 ounce monster drink) Overall a great place to stop by for some decent late night food. Parking was easy to find also."}
{"text":"On the day of us leaving Vegas, our friend really loved his breakfast at the Peppermill before we took off. Since I haven't been to the restaurant yet, I was pretty excited to go check it out. 

The restaurant was decorated like a strip club without the poles. It was colorful and packed with people. I ordered steak and eggs and also crab cake, slave girl got the crab cake benny. 

The benny was OK. I actually didn't try it but slave girl said it wasn't bad. 

I asked my steak cooked to medium rare and it actually came out right! My only issue was part of the steak tasted bitter. Don't ask me how, but it did and I had no idea why. The only thing that really pissed me off was, I asked for over easy on eggs and it came out scrambled.

The crab cake was actually forgotten, well, not by the kitchen, but by our waitress. It came with 3 pieces and it was actually very tasty.

The service was shit. We got no water even after we asked for water. Our server never checked on us and we had to wave her over like in a Chinese restaurant. She forgot my crab cake and screwed up my egg order. When we were ready to leave, I couldn't get a box to pack my food since she was no where to be found. When I finally got up to get the box myself, our sever saw me and stopped me. She told me to return to my seat and would bring one to the table. THEN she came to the table empty handed, wtf? That was when she told me she wanted to pack it for me. At that point I didn't want to have extra stuff in my leftover so I asked for the box, again.

Peppermill, just because you were in couple of movies didn't make you god. Count me out for life."}
{"text":"This restaurant was the first dinner spot of Mink's first trip to Vegas. We met Sheila G., Mel C. and Terri R. there. They were great company and gave us some awesome recommendations of new restaurants to check out while visiting. Our lively conversation definitely matched the lively ambiance of the restaurant. Imagine waking into a strip club but instead of strippers, you have diners. Even the sugar here is very colorful. 

Mink doesn't eat much so she found something on the menu that was just her portion size. Unfortunately our server told us that it's only available for kids and seniors. I felt that he could have made an exception but he didn't. Mink ended up ordering from the available menu and threw away 80% of her plate. What a waste. Positive note is portions are generous here. Mel C said they use 10 eggs for their omelette. 

I ordered their French Dip with a Hot Tea. There is no photo because they took forever to bring my order out. Everyone was eating already and I was hungry so I dug right in. Sandwich was decent and onion rings weren't too greasy. The au ju it came with was average. Meal was a little greasier than I'm accustomed to so my stomach was definitely not a fan. 

Customer service was decent but lack of professionalism when we asked to have a group photo taken. One of the workers kept pushing our photographer while she was trying to take our photo. We ended up with some blurry photos. That concluded the evening so it left a negative impression of this establishment. 5 star company but unfortunately that can't be said about this restaurant."}
{"text":"You need to chill and have drinks but you're hungry..., this is your spot. The wings are freakn bomb, the drinks Freakn Delicious, and the atmosphere Supa chill. Big group or just with yr 'date' it will start or end the night right. Love the pit style seats in the bar, nice comfy sofas and the hostesses are very nice always checking in with their guests. They have TV screens in all areas."}
{"text":"This place is extraordinary! The setting is beautiful! They have a dim botanical garden kind of theam. I ordered the Mediterranean omelet and a the sin city.  The portions and huge so me and my sunificant other were able to share.  Prices are reasonable and it was busy but the food came really quick. Everything was beautiful.  Only thing I didn't like was the mimosa comes with ice. The restaurant is part of Las Vegas history and the have a beautiful lounge as well."}
{"text":"Las Vegas is an inbreed hick town.  Just look at the UNLV masott, he looks Wiley Coyotte or a  confederate slaver.  Somebody recommended this place to me because of the night life. I was hesitant about any place named the Peppermill, Buttery or Cupake factory.  It sounds  Leave it to Beaver white.  Well, my suspicions were confirmed this weekend.  An African-American women wearing Hijab was asked to remove her hijab because it was gang-releated. Later it was deemed a miscommunication. Sure, we know what is going on.  If you are not a Trump supporter, boycott this racist business.  If fact, I suggest you boycott the whole state unless you go into a business that is minority owned and run."}
{"text":"BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!  The portions are BIG! Old Skool Vegas at its best. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner! I like the fact you can get a cocktail anytime it seems. My breakfast was delicious. My scramble eggs with cheese were cooked to my liking and the pancakes were really tasty. YesI had a cocktail with my breakfast! Hey it is Vegas!"}
{"text":"We visited The Peppermill for breakfast with my family. We wanted a place that was centrally located, and had good food at decent prices. We were not disappointed!

None of us had been there before, so we made the mistake of ordering an entree each. Their servings are really big! I fill up fast, so I ended up taking more than half of my meal home. My aunt and I both ordered the Spinach and Feta omelette and I really enjoyed it. It had a good amount of feta cheese, which is a big deal to me. They serve it with potatoes and bread. I chose the blueberry muffin which was served warm. Yum!  

My mom ordered the fruit plate and it was enormous. It included strawberries, grapes, honeydew, banana, cantaloupe, pineapple and watermelon. They also give you a small banana nut loaf with marshmallow cream. It was so good!  

My grandma ordered the Pancake combo. It came with three large pancakes, three eggs, two bacon strips and two sausage links. It was a very large entree. I should also mention that I really enjoyed the coffee here. 

All in all, it was a great and very filling meal. The service was really good as well. I'm sure we'll go back."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place. My pastrami burger was brought to the table and after the first bite I found a hair in the burger. They said they would make me a second d burger which took another 20 minutes. The food quality just didn't hit the spot for me. Even after the remake. Was willing to give it a second try but not a single manager came up to the table or was able to talk. Oh well, I had high hopes for this place. At least the interior and our waitresses were nice."}
{"text":"Great service, big plates of great food ..love the atmosphere of allowance but it's a restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered Philly and fries = horrible.  Philly was dry chip beef.... and I mean dry!  My husband ordered Giro w/onion rings.  He thought Giro was ok but would rather have my uncooked fries (even thou I ordered them well) over his onion rings.
Can honestly say we will not be back.  The cab driver brought us there  after 10 pm... maybe the A squad wasn't there cooking anymore."}
{"text":"I ate here and it was great! Very chaotic but the food was delicious. I tried to place a pick up order with Candy, and she said they cannot do pickup orders. Only in person orders which is super inconvenient. They will forever loose money this way. 3 stars for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Back again for the 2nd night in a row. & no let downs again - staff was awesome food was huge & good . This time I had chicken fried steak meal. & she got breakfast , & we had the half order of nachos which is enough for 4 - not the cheapest grub on the strip  but  quality & portion make it well worth it . Try it & you will see why it is still standing after so many others have fallen away."}
{"text":"Funky Fabulous! 

After reading these reviews I simply had to see the Fireside Lounge and it did not disappoint. 

The decor is Disco Pink meets a 1980's Cocaine Party and throw in LOTS of fake trees. 

Drink prices reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Saw on a Vegas forum about this place and the rave reivews. I wanted to try new places out in Vegas. Went with my brother and sister. It was ok. I split a omelette with my brother and my sister tried the French Dip and said it was ok/good. The portions are huge! 

Don't think I would be back. Then again I heard it's closing!"}
{"text":"Decent good, huge portions, great bloody Mary's! Hey waitresses... Can't beat it for a good o fashion  hungover breakfast"}
{"text":"Wow this place has that Miami Vice feel lol.  Came here after having one too many drinks, but it was to a point where I was enjoying myself here just fine.  

Our cab driver recommended this place to us since it was a 24hr. joint. We were seated in a round booth and it was really dim from what I could remember, but who wants to be in bright light when you're faded as heck?!? This place had a very chill ambiance and not too mention good food served in reasonable proportions!!! 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant/lounge."}
{"text":"We came here to try a scorpion. I love how big the drinks are in Vegas. Shared the drink and it had 3 long straws coming up from it. 
Cool place with a lounge feel. The theme was reminiscent of Boogie Nights. You know the movie with Mark Whalberg. When we left we bumped into Holly Madison. She is so petite but even more beautiful in person. I will be back to check it out next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The omelets were smaller than I expected. The line is out the door. It's a party inside. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast on 27-Dec 2011 and were greeted by a loooong queue. That's always a good sign - a place has to be good if there are so many people willing to wait for the first meal of the day! Fortunately, there were a couple of seats available at the counter, and we asked the hostess if there was a queue for that. Nope!! So we just walked straight in and it was the most awesome feeling in the world - jumping a queue of about 30. Haha

Anyways, on to the food. GIANT portion sizes. I am a ravenous beast in the morning, and I could only make through half of my Marco Pollo Omelet and the monster portion of hash browns. My husband ordered the french toast, and got 3 (or was it 4?) huge slices with a mound of fruit on top. The food was not uniquely delicious, but it was satisfying. All in all, we left happy and content.

We will definitely return whenever we visit the sin city next!"}
{"text":"Didn't get all of the 5 stars because they forgot our reservation, but that just meant more bar time :) 

I couldn't tell the theme of the decor but it worked. The food portions were huge. We ordered a side of fries and were presented with a big bowl of delicious fried goodness. Of course we had to offset that with the fruit plate ( half a pineapple, a few bananas and the rest of the store) 

I chose the steak salad. It was done to my liking and very very delicious. I definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"As I ambled into this fine establishment by myself, I opted to sit at the bar, so that I could be seated immediately.  This simple decision gave me a beautiful vantage point of the kitchen, and all the food that came out of it.  Believe me when I tell you that EVERYTHING that came out of their kitchen looked AMAZING.  I was hungry when I sat down, but by the time my food came, I was drooling on the counter.  The portions are big, the prices are fair, and the food is to die for.  It's centrally located on the Strip, so it should definitely be a stop on your next LV visit.  Service was great, and the atmosphere was wonderful.  Will definitely be back again....and again."}
{"text":"They do not do take out orders over the phone!!! this is only hurting their guests and i have never heard of a place not doing takeout!! its strange and honestly they have lost my business over this.  The food i got honestly was not that good it was greasy diner food that was not worth the price i paid.  Go spend your money somewhere else !"}
{"text":"This place is super good! Huge portions! The chicken Alfredo & chicken wings are the best!!!"}
{"text":"The best thing I had for breakfast was my Hawaiian Sunset Mimosa. The service was great, as well as the atmosphere, we even received a complimentary photo. Unfortunately the food was disappointing!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Some things could use some cleaning up a hit but still a classic hit. Ohhhh and please put a better music video in already that's up to date sheesh!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here because the service was really bad, we sat down for 10 mins before we called a waitress that was just talking to two other waitresses. She said just a moment and continued talking to them. Finally another waitress came to take our drink order, then she brought everyone's drinks but my water. So I asked again after 15 mins I had to ask again. All in all food was ok but service was really off today. (Mon 3/25/13)"}
{"text":"The Peppermill was open early when we got up - and near our hotel making it an easy choice. The food and décor made it worth staying. We got eggs benedict and just a standard egg and sausage plate. Good service, amusing décor and solid food."}
{"text":"Peppermill is a Vegas staple & for my BFF & I, a place we must eat at when in the city of sin. Rainbow colored sugar crystals, a funky decor, and awesome service from the lovely gowned ladies, Peppermill is hard to turn away. 

Open 24/7, Peppermill is the perfect restaurant to stop at after a night of drinking. Or a great spot for breakfast (but expect a longgg wait.) The menu is bountiful in choices and its safe to say there's something for everyone. Portions are very large and can usually be shared, and for such large portions are worth the price.

If you're in Vegas, add this place to your list! Call ahead to see if there's a wait & if there is, order to go! The food is comforting and always hits the spot. I always order the buffalo chicken wrap & highly recommend! Served with curly fries or regular fries, you can't go wrong either way. Can't forget to mention the generous sides of ranch!"}
{"text":"Mirrored ceilings? Check.
Fluorescent rainbow lights? Check.
Vegas eye candy? Check.
Hot tub & fireplace combo? Check. 
Peppermills on the table? Check. 

yeah, this place is sweeeeet.  And they make a BLT with avocado...BLAT!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quick stop here with girlfriends on a Friday night. Parking was easy and free in their lot and without reservations, we were seated immediately. 

We were also helped immediately by our waiter, also - a pretty bar girl taking alcoholic requests and got approached by the Staff photographer who insisted the photo is free. This was the hugest problem we had with Peppermill since she INSISTED the photo is free - to take! To have is $20 for one copy, $25 for a second. Um, sorry, that's not a deal when the first is overpriced at $20! 

We wanted some light bites and got the appetizer platter (substituted the Shrimp for more cheese sticks), and got the Fruit Boat for $18.99 with a side of cottage cheese. It was all fine with a cool presentation with a great waiter. 

On a side note, the bathrooms are very clean which is appreciated considering it was a Friday of a holiday weekend with lots of tourists! And a wedding party to boot!"}
{"text":"The food is good here, portions are LARGE, prices are commensurate with the portion size. Diner atmosphere. Good service, full bar and always open."}
{"text":"Went here on a recent trip for breakfast and I was a little skeptical at first when we pulled up but the breakfast was awesome! Make sure to get here a little early or you'll end up waiting. The breakfast was huge, my boyfriend and I shared both days and it was plenty. Unique atmosphere and good service. Will be back whenever we return to Vegas."}
{"text":"Overall excellent.  The decor is something from a bad 70's discotheque, but it grows on you.  Expect a delay, we were there at 1100 on a Saturday, and had about a 45 min wait.  You can hang out in the sunken lounge if you want, that was kind of neat, and the drinks were good.  The dining area is a zoo, very busy.  That was my only critique; the waitress was so busy, our water glasses never got refilled.  The food was great and the portions were huge, think almost Hash House A-Go-Go big.  My omelet was the size of a football, and my buddy's pancakes were the size of a large plate.  Cocktail waitresses roam the floor as well, so drinks are available.  If you are on the north part of the strip, definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Favorite spot!  Good food and amazing lounge!"}
{"text":"Late night finds. There are a lot of other restaurants open in Las Vegas.  I used to eat here all the time after a long night of partying since it was the closest to the Wynn.  You can always count on their food portion in being huge! This place is like a diner type of place.  I had a variety of dishes and never had an issue.  Everything is decent. Service is so-so.  Sometimes you'll have a fun waiter here."}
{"text":"We've had The Peppermill on our radar to get to for the past few times we've been to Vegas.  Some reason, never made it there before.  This time, we were staying at the Riviera and it is right next door.  I told my husband we'd better make it there this time!  SO glad we did.  Tried the Scorpion drink - $18 but what the heck, two seperate drinks will cost ya that.  It is quite tasty.  The service was excellent and food pretty quick.  We about fell over when they brought out our dishes - they are HUGE.  Each of us could only eat half.  Should have gotten one and split it.  Hate to just throw all that out, so we boxed it to go, hoping to run into one of the many homeless hungry folks wondering around there to give it to.  Our bill was only $60 and that's with an $18 drink.  Not bad at all.  We went and sat by the fireplace in the lounge to finish off our scorpion before headin out to Fremont St. for the night.  Really wish we'd eaten here more often on our trip.  Bet the breakfasts are really good too."}
{"text":"As many times as we have been to Vegas I can't believe it took us this long to check out this iconic restaurant on the edge the strip. First things first! That decor! It harkens back to a better time. I felt like I went into a time warp. The portions are huge and everyone loved that you could choose a muffin instead of toast as your side. P.S. you have to try the muffins they are amazing! Make sure you go. The menu is literally like 20 pages long(JK but not quite) and sure to have something there for even the chooseiest of eaters. Check it out! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Went here on a saturday morning with my husband and two old friends who had flown into Vegas 15 minutes prior, demanding brunch. After any buffet, Egg Works, and Hash House were all shot down for having too large of portion sizes, I finally sold them on the Peppermill, largely by promising them neon.

Pros: 
 - Damn tasty diner food and freely flowing cups of coffee. This is all I really ask for in a solid Brunch Experience
-Super friendly staff and prompt service, and no problems with slightly different orders and keeping coffee coming.
- The look on my friends' faces when they realized this place didn't have small portions either! Oh noes, mah dietz. I laughed and laughed and laughed/

Cons:
- Long wait, really with no where to sit and wait. We hung out on a curb and were frequently asked if we needed a cab.
- Prices were a bit on the high side relative to the awesomeness of the food. Got the impression I was paying for the neon. Wasn't too bad, but also nothing to compose a sonnet over.

Overall Verdict:
- Yummy classic diner food in a classically vegas atmosphere. Will return when hungover, or with out of town and unadventurous guests. Won't be on the favorites anytime list, but certainly not shabby."}
{"text":"The service here is great, the waitresses always make sure your are doing well and have everything you need. The food is bland. My boyfriend got eggs Benedict and I had a veggie omelette. Both lacked seasoning. the hash browns were cooked well, and the coffee was roughly $5 a cup. I would love to try dinner, I just hope I'll have a better food experience.  Just for $50 for a breakfast that is less than $30 at other restaurant with good seasoning, i wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"The Taxi driver recommended to try this out. Cute place to try, nice decorations, unique but wasn't that impressed with the food I ordered. and you know its ALL about the food... Ordered the combo with sausages, eggs and pancakes. Pancakes are very big, comes with 3. Barely finished half of it.  Food was just Okay... worth a try just to see what its was all about...But probably wont be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is like a better version of dennys. Food is very tasty and the portions are big. The service is alittle slow, but what do you expect when  the restaurant is packed."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here every morning we were in Las Vegas. Be aware, their omelets are made from 7-10 eggs. If you get one, plan to share! Excellent food, pleasent atmosphere (themed)."}
{"text":"If your tired of driving around and trying to decide where to go eat this place is the place to go when in vegas. The food here is so good service here is fast open 24/7 and big portions."}
{"text":"A very cozy place with great vibe. The staff were friendly and the food was great. I usually complain about portions but here I had left-overs! It might sound normal but that's very unusual for me! Food was great. Entrees came with a side of soup or salad and the meals came with a plate of garlic bread which we really liked."}
{"text":"I have to give this Place a zero because every time we come front host Never Ever greet us and when we are about to leave nobody ever say by and anything of the sort. Lady of the chicken head females spent more time talking and on their cell phone then speaking to us high profile guess."}
{"text":"A week in Vegas, my husband and I went there for two lunches. First, it's because it's easier to find tables. And, it was close to the convention center. Of course, the food was good too!

I had the CLUB SANDWICHES for the first time. There was a lot of bacon and ham. The bread was toasted. It was great. And, it came with a lot of fries! 

The second time, my husband and I shared 22OZ STRAWBERRY MILK SHAKE. It was HUGE and GREAT!!! My husband and I loved it! 

Also, I ordered CHICKEN FRIED STEAK. That was my first chicken fried steak. It was covered with gravy. It was crunchy and flavorful. The steak was so big that I didn't even touch the eggs. Haha... 

I like this place. It is a nice little dinner. The decor was very cute. It is a bit off the strip, but it's close enough. I think that it is a great breakfast place with a good price in Vegas. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here for our one year anniversary last night. It was my first time there, but I had always heard great things about this place, so I figured I'd share this as another first with my girl and I'm glad I made that decision. There's a lounge where you can just sit and have a drink by the fire (the drinks were awesome!) And the cocktail waitresses were so nice. After a few drinks, we walked over to the dining room, which had a 50's retro feel. Our server Samantha was so nice. If you're looking for a nice place to go to for chorizo and eggs, pancakes, or any other feel-good food, come down to this place and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Such a cool restaurant! Definitely a must in Vegas. The food is great for brunch or dinner and the fireside lounge is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Huge servings! I ordered a Marco Polo Omelet and only could eat about half of it. My husband ordered the French toast and even left a few slices behind. The coffee is hot and fresh and the cups are huge. The staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"My buddy Daniel recommended this place to me when I told him I was headed to Vegas. He saw it on No Reservations and I was automatically sold! I mean, who doesn't want the Bourdain experience?! 

So after an already long night of drinking, eating and more drinking my girlfriend and I hopped in a cab and ended up here and I'm glad we did! We didn't eat here but we did share a Scorpion. A tropical drink concoction that was the cap for the night! What is in it you ask? I'm not sure about everything but there is some pineapple and LOTS OF BOOZE...oh yeah and ICE CREAM! I don't think you will find it on the menu but you can order it. 

It's a cool throwback to old Vegas that includes an awesome lounge, fire pits and a mirrored ceiling! It's got tons of character and has become a 'must go to' spot for me anytime I will find myself in Las Vegas. Yes, it is over the top and cheesy but Vegas is all about excess anyways!"}
{"text":"I've been here every time I've been in Vegas. Usually after a long night of unspeakable behavior, my group of hooligans and I end up here at around 5 or 6 am for food.

One time we ate with two local strippers. Good times, great food. Benedict is awesome."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast spot on the strip!
The food and coffee are delicious and the service is incredible
The portions are huge - you can really share your order with two other people!
The decor is unique and check out the bar in back - a vegas Classic!"}
{"text":"Old Fashioned 70's Vegas style and really good food and deserts :)"}
{"text":"I can tell people back home I went to a gay bar with a breakfast twist. Holy mirror wall, Batman! lol

This place is so great! For a tourist hotspot, they get you to a table asap and with a smile The food portions are ginormous. When I order a mimosa, I wasn't expecting the huge glass I received. I was greatly satisfied and full right away. 

The Fireside Lounge is just awesome. Above the firepit when we were waiting had Cher playing.

Come on, who's naive in Vegas?"}
{"text":"Old school.  Diner fast and fresh service.  A loaded menu of gluttony.  This is why we patronized the Peppermill 3x on our recent visit.  We sat at the counter each time and had the pleasure to talk with the daytime manager as well as several servers (Crystal, Elisha, and Al, to name a few).  Everyone was kind, hardworking, and friendly.  We had breakfast one day, a midday snack of a quesadilla and milkshake, and the appetizer sampler the last day.  I can't fit in my pants now that I'm back at work, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best place we have been to eat in Las Vegas. The servers are amazing, so nice and helpful, the bar tender and cocktail waitresses were awesome! Ask for the dirty martini with the blue cheese stuffed olives.... yummmm! And the food is superb!! I will definitely be coming back every time I visit!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very old school Las Vegas decor. Its a lounge, bar and restaurant with 80's style decor. The food are good, big portions. The service staff are attentive."}
{"text":"Nice find on the north end of the strip. Large portions. Very tasty. Only thing that prevents it from 5 stars is the lack of healthy items on the menu. Service was pretty good as well. If you are leaving your hotel for breakfast, go here. Or stop by after the night is over and the sun has risen!"}
{"text":"this is the place to be if you dont come here did you even come to vegas no matter what you order it is delicious there hot wings are the best i have tried as well as there peppermill burger this made the whole trip to vegas worth it and waiting in line"}
{"text":"Coffee was delicious and the place is open 24/7 across the street from our hotel kinda, grabbed a lyft didn't feel like walking. Good service cool environment ! Staff was good ! Had the Denver omelet and had browns, it was okay still a bit wet and they used cheese slices instead of. Shredded and we're heavy with onion and pepper, not on meet! French toast  ambrosia with the sour cream omg delicious!!!! Very happy!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here at 0800 on New Year's Day.  Our waitress, Maribel, was great!!  I had a LORRAINE omelet and the Major had a MARCO POLO omelet. They must use four eggs -- both omelets were HUGE. Unfortunately, these omelets were only average. Not a lot of flavor.  We asked for avocado on the side, but didn't get very much. Peppermill does not give a military discount."}
{"text":"I eat at the peppermill almost once a week - I would give the food 3 stars because it is average all around. The atmosphere gets 5 stars and makes it a must visit when coming in to Las Vegas. Stop in have a drink and share your meal with a friend!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here and it's the same as it was 5 yrs ago. Good food & great service. There was a wait, but they were good at getting folks in. It's located on the main strip across from Circus Circus. Also, any place that offers turkey products is alright with me!"}
{"text":"The food is good, huge portion sizes, breakfast served 24-7 & separate cocktail waitress, reasonable prices what more can you ask for? They have variety of American dishes, from salads, sandwiches (even gyros), pastas, etc. Even a bigger plus for the fact it's open 24 hrs, just the hot pink/electric blue colors can be alittle bothersome if you stare at it too long. It has this retro nighttime diner feel to it with 80's music playing in the background"}
{"text":"Lots of food for the price, especially for a place on The Strip in Vegas. The chorizo and eggs with some tortillas on the side was very filling. I think I didn't eat again until about 8 at night. Staff was very friendly, and service sparkled."}
{"text":"The food was okay and the decor is kind of \"Old Las Vegas\".  What put me off was when I asked the waitress as she was taking our orders to do two separate checks (we were two couples) and she informed me that they weren't allowed to do that.  First time I have EVER heard of that.  It seemed more like she didn't want to be bothered.  We often go with other couples and prefer separate checks, so we are unlikely to come back.  Too many other good options in Vegas that are happy to accommodate you."}
{"text":"Was excited to eat here until i found out you cannot call in a order for pick up.. You must go there to order and awkwardly wait 45 minutes for your food..  
This is the first restaurant ive ever heard do this...
Im sick and would rather not get everyone there sick but apparently thats the only option.  Since im not an asshole who likes to make people sick i guess ill just never eat here.. thanks for nothing peppermill!!"}
{"text":"Great place to catch breakfast.  Off the strip a little, but worth it if you want to have an oold school Vegas experience.  Most dishes can be split."}
{"text":"I used to come here for lunch for work a while back and now I remember why I don't go there for any other reason. The food sucks, the prices are high, the service sucks, and it's COLD AS F$^# in there. This is a tourist trap sort of place, so be prepared for a very long wait for a table. My friends ordered soup and salads, and I ordered French Toast and coffee.  Everything was just MEH. I would never come here again."}
{"text":"I LOVE this spot! Great food, fast service, friendly service, affordable prices, AND 24 hours! Yep. Done deal."}
{"text":"Ok so maybe my expectations were too high, everyone kept recommending this place saying how awesome the food was. It was Sunday, a few hours before we had to fly home. We usually like to hit someplace unique to vegas, something like hash house a go go or oyster bar before flying home. The cab driver mentioned Peppermill and since we have always heard great things decided to try it. Nothing was bad, but everything was just ordinary, except maybe the size of the plates. Peppermill burger was just ho hum, chicken fried steak and eggs - no different from anything else. The interior was cool, waitress was awesome. To me tho it's just an ordinary diner, can't imagine going back for anything really"}
{"text":"Came here for nostalgic reasons.   I miss the old Peppermill location in Marin.  Many memories of the Peppermill, from the fruit on the plate,  huge portions,  neon lights,  waitresses in short skirts,  cocktailers in long dresses.   The Vegas restaurant is almost identical,  so it was a blast from the past!   One huge difference was there was a long line of people to get in,  long wait times for a table.   If Marin's Peppermill had that issue,  they probably would have stayed in business!   We were able to get a seat at the counter immediately,  and were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.  We split the omelet,  hash browns,  English muffin,  and a giant pancake side.  Definitely share/split meals here!   Service was quick and friendly.   

We really wanted to have a drink at the fire pit in the bar,  but it was being fixed.   The cocktail menu had all the classics,  and I was so looking forward to a Ramos fizz.   Next time for sure! 

*girl to girl, woman to woman:  waitresses, be careful when you are reaching to get the food from the the higher heated counter.   The people at the bar got a lot of panty shots.*"}
{"text":"I love the food.  I go every time I have company in town.  I took my mom yesterday and was told that the soup of the day was cheesy potato with bacon.  The waitress was wrong and the soup was actually  clam chowder.  It was delicious, but that's a pretty major mistake when you factor in the possibility of food allergies.  Fortunately, I have none.  

Also, she offered to box up our food... but didn't give us one of our leftover meals.  Small mistake, but I had almost an entire sandwich and plate of fries that she didn't give is.  I didn't notice until we got home, so the food I intended to have later was wasted."}
{"text":"Standard diner with standard Vegas prices ;)

I came in around 3am looking for eggs, and that's exactly what I ordered.  My friends got the whole shebang: chicken tenders, quesadillas, BLT and club sandwiches etc.

Satisfying!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hang out with friends in Las Vegas! The fireside lounge is amazing and cozy. Great food and cheap drinks. I also love the Diner at any time. Great steaks and breakfast menu. This was Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra's favorite place after hours, you will love it too!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here. I come here every time I come to Vegas and want a filling meal! I have gotten the Masarati omelet before and it was well worth it, it has close to a dozen eggs. This time I got the French  toast Ambrosia. It was really good and of course could have fed a few people. Really good food"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Was greeted and seated promptly. Everyone was extremely warm & friendly. Our waitress was fantastic! Wish I remembered her name. The food was fresh & good. Also didn't take too long despite the place being full. My favorite thing about this place was the decor! Very fun & authentic old Vegas atmosphere. Love coming at night as the fire pits are lit. Love this place."}
{"text":"This place is right up my alley. Cool atmosphere and HUGE portions. My new Vegas spot everytime from now on."}
{"text":"Peppermill used to be the staple of diner food in Las Vegas for me. I haven't previously had a bad experience with the staff.
 
Come here for the portions and the diner-esque food! 

The wait exceeded 30 minutes for a Tuesday mid morning. It was a full house. The hostesses, Caroline and Kim, working at the podium. Kim rolled her eyes after we told her we were waiting on another person. It set the tone for our meal.

The bus boys/runners were clearly annoyed with us, as well. One of them was Jeff, I believe. We asked for five of everything, but they only saw four people. I guess one more was too much to provide.

Thanks Elisha for being very attentive despite the commotion. It definitely made up for the rude service we received at the beginning."}
{"text":"This is a must every time we are here.  We love the food!  Anything you order is awesome.  The wait staff is great.  Great diner.  You can order what you want when you want, no matter what time it is.  Huge portions, everyone leaves very full and happy!  If you can go during the middle of the day, your wait isn't as long."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service was a bit slow and the wait was bit high when they are busy. The prices was ok for Vegas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! Huge portions, but does not lack on quality. Service is good, although when busy lacks. Vegas institution."}
{"text":"Big portions. Lots of choices on the menu. Decent value too. Breakfast served all day. Beers are 5.50 or do , so not cheap especially compared to casinos. The neon lights does give a bit of strip club atmosphere but its bright enough to see and eat and it's actually a cool atmosphere.
 
 Only downside was the leather booths made my butt sweat! And some of the booths make for oddly arranged seating."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch on a Saturday morning, July 7, 2012 (sorry, long overdue review!)

Open 24 hours? Check.
\"Interesting\" decor that makes you feel walked through a wormhole into a 70s stripclub? Check.
American-sized portions? America, Fuck Yeah -- CHECK.
Indoor firepit? Check.

As Damon H mentions, the food is \"surprisingly very good.\"  The neon lighting may throw you off, but this place serves some solid grub.  It's on the North end of the strip (e.g. Wynn), so if you're staying in that area it's worth stopping by.  If you're on the South end (e.g. Mandalay Bay), it probably isn't worth enduring the shitty Strip traffic or taxi bill to get here... and if you are staying at one of the examples I listed, you're probably better off impressing your date with room service and possibly another round of drinks back at the room.

The wait here can be a little lengthy though, but I don't think its as bad as Hash House... and if you are intent on getting here, it's probably best to take Koval Ln or Paradise Rd up to avoid the clusterfuck ;)"}
{"text":"As Frank Barone used to say, \"Holy Crap!\"  And I mean that in a good way.

I walk into this place early on a Saturday morning and it's packed, with families, all-nighters, bikers and such.  My waitress tells me later this is nothing compared to when they have conventions, the place is wall-to-wall busy.

Today, the place was hopping.  And so were the waitresses, who were wearing their tight skirts that fit right into the Vegas old school.  Lots of blue neon lights.

I take a seat at the counter. Yes, the service here is a little slower, but hey, I was in no hurry.  Finally, my waitress offers me drink and a menu.   I look at the menu and have a hard time figuring out what I want because of the various options.  I pick the French Toast Ambrosia. A few minutes later, my long-legged waitress Jennifer brings me this plate of french toast that is covered with fruit and what looks like a half can of whipped cream.  I'm thinking, how in the world am I going to eat all this?  And as I look around, everyone else is being served huge volumes of food also.  At that moment, I decided that I am going to the Peppermill every time I go to Vegas and I'm bringing my friends.

Yes, the food was very good.  No, I did not finish it all.  But it did make good leftovers.

How did I miss this place after all these years?"}
{"text":"Step back in time and get Giant Pancakes!!!!

A Diner and Lounge stuck in time warp.

Is is 50's? 1960s? Eighties? Yes

There was a wait to get a table however we got to wait by the fire in the lounge.  The waitress took our drink order and we got to chill before being transported to our table among the fake trees and busy diner rush.

Everything we had was decent above average diner food.  Friendly waitresses in Judy Jetson uniforms.  

We would come here again just for the weird cool vibe but the Giant Pancake is also a draw."}
{"text":"after spending a night and half the morning at the palms burning tons of calories on the dance floor i figured that i needed to refuel.  earlier in the day i had been told by some people at the wynn that the best late night/early morning eats could be had here.  

i am not gonna lie. at first i was a bit skeptical. after spending a few too many hours gambling at the $5 blackjack tables at circus circus the night before i happened across this place on my way back the wynn.  maybe it was the bitterness from the money i lost. maybe it was the on-setting alcohol poisoning. whatever it was, i was less than impressed.

ladies and gentlemen of yelp. i implore you. do not judge a book by its cover. because this place is a gem. i ordered nachos. (my new go to for late night eats). a platter of nachos the size of a sewer lid was placed in front of me. and they were delicious. in fact they gave me exactly what i needed: greasy, fatty, awesomeness.  i could not even finish half. i am not even joking. and the nachos were not the only large portioned meal. there were more leftovers on the table than food in our collective stomachs. 

so a few tips for your next vegas visit:

1.) drink and dance until about 6 am 
2.) go to the peppermill
3.) order the nachos
4.) enjoy the deliciousness

youre welcome."}
{"text":"Went here to try out \"The Scorpion\" the big drink they serve out of that fishbowl glass. It cost $18. It was ok, nothing absolutely amazing, but it should be tried. 

Also got the Buffalo Wings they were like $10.95, they are pretty good.
Got the Brushetta for $8.95, it was really good. 

The interior of the fireside lounge is pretty dark. Our service was reasonable and fast enough. We got our bill quickly and had an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"This is the perfect late night substitute for Denny's or IHOP after an evening of the Vegas life. The portions are enormous and the food tastes good... even sober. 

I had breakfast, go figure. It was the Peppermill Omelet that consisted of a cholesterol bursting amount of eggs along with hash browns and a blueberry muffin. The omelet was as good as anything at a breakfast place. The muffin was very fresh. 

I can't tell whether this place is from the Hobbit or a vintage 70's slutty diner. It doesn't matter though because the waitresses fit right in, Vegas style. It's worth going back."}
{"text":"This place is the Mecca of diners, lined with chrome and neon lights this is the what all diners aspire to be.  I love the peppermill, because it is classic vegas.  Despite having not much for me to eat as a vegan, I still loved the atmosphere.  I had oatmeal, which was massive, so I can't speak to the food.  

They have a good list of cocktails that are decent prices.  The fireside lounge is awesome, has a firepit and the ladies are all in black evening gowns.  This place is a must for everyone to visit at least once."}
{"text":"Nightmare from the get go.  Service was TERRIBLE.  Had to fend for ourselves. We were never checked on and not only had to go get our own drinks in the lounge, but had to go find our server for the check as well.  To top it off, a piece of chipped glass was almost swallowed by my sister, who at 1st thought it was ice.  We showed it to the server, but she could have cared less.  Not even an apology. Two glasses were chipped and one had the sharp chip inside with the ice.  Thank God she didn't swallow it!  What was suppose to be a great night...a disaster:(. So bummed."}
{"text":"Loved the kitsch and the aura of the place.  Red Velvet and red lighting in the bar feels like Old Vegas.  If we had only done the bar, my review would be higher.  But the food was meh.  Bland roast beef sandwich, salty soup, it was all just a cut below Denny's...which was right next door.  So, go for the bar, but skip dinner."}
{"text":"My friend attempted to describe Peppermill to me before we ate there yesterday. \"It's as if Dennys and Rainforest Cafe had a bastard child... Oh, well you'll see..\" Two words: deliciously tacky. 

At first our waitress was prompt in taking our order before the rest of our group arrived. It later took her forever to get everyone's order in. I split the Marco Polo omelet with my friend. 

They describe it as a huge portion, but honestly I could've finished the whole thing by myself. Wasn't really impressed. I felt like it was lacking in flavor if you didn't have a bit of the tomato hollandaise sauce to eat your bite with. The hash browns were good though. I'd much rather have gotten an omelet from the Omelet house."}
{"text":"Awesome place with a great and vivid atmosphere. Good food and service. A must try when in town for Vegas."}
{"text":"The best and consistent place for breakfast Monday-Friday! Stay away on weekends way to busy!"}
{"text":"There was a 15 minute wait to be seated. Once we sat down it took about 5 minutes to get our order. The food was yummmy! You should try this place."}
{"text":"This place is old school greatness. I can't imagine why anyone would go the Denny's nearby when this gem is right there.

Oversized portions, quality grub, great coffee all in a neon fueled diner setting. Open 24 hours. They always bring their A game.

The Fireside Lounge in the back is a must stop for anyone. You will recognize it from the movie Casino. Bring some friends and order some Scorpions."}
{"text":"Wife and I went not knowing what to expect. This place is jumping and this was 3am...plenty of good views..did realize it was a bi bar...but still had a great time."}
{"text":"This review is based on visiting their bar/lounge area.
I have not dined here.

This place is fantastic on a date or better yet on a first date.
Atmosphere is dim. Truly romantic with the fire pit.
Service is great.
Drinks can be a little pricey, but what do you expect when you're not at a gaming table or slot machine getting them for free.

The outside can be a little off putting as it looks like it's a Denny's or something.

Weekdays can be just as busy as a weekend on some occasions."}
{"text":"This restaurant, just south of the Riviera is an excellent choice for breakfast with GREAT coffee, HUGE portions (consider sharing omelets and pancakes and hash browns).  Service was great for us both days we went there as well. I wish I had discovered it sooner!  

Great fresh fruit bowls went by us as well and if i didn't have SO much food, I would have ordered that as well.

The restaurant has a 50's style theme working and the bar adjoining would really be a nice place to hang out and have a drink!"}
{"text":"Top notch with a hint of old Vegas love the vibe from the second you walk in.  Fellas need a late night stop and fill look no further, awesome bar"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Food was delicious & they give ya plenty of it. Our waitress was awesome, as was the decor! We are already planning a trip back to Vegas & a breakfast for dinner at Peppermill is definitely on our must do list!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent food.  It may appear to be pricey but I promise the portions are HUGE.  The only negative is THE GREETER n THE CASHIER...I believe they were both Asian...we're very rude...neither smiled...greeted...asked how our meal was or thanked us...barely even made eye contact.  Our waiter..however was awesome...repeatedly checked on us..and always cheerful...we ordered the appetizer sampler and he assured us it was HUGE and we prob weren't  gonna order anything else.. lol and he was right."}
{"text":"AWWWWESOOOOMMMEEEE!!!!!! Hot waitresses, great atmosphere, great decor, food ROCKS! So glad we found out about this place. Ate here after a long night at EDC. Boom!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Unlike any diner ive even been too. Super cool atmosphere and the service was top notch! The portions are huge. Enjoued the food so much we ate here twice on our vacation."}
{"text":"5 of us.  Bill $101 (tip not included).  BELOW average diner food.  WAY, way below average.  Arrived Friday morning at 11am.  30 minute wait.  Super busy.  Neon everywhere.  Cool exterior, we were pumped and ready to eat!  service was efficient.  Most of us got breakfast, and only one got a sandwich.  All the breakfast food (hashbrowns, omelettes, chicken friend steak) was just blah blah blah.  Sure, larger portions, but NOTHING was amazing or above average.  I can't stress enough how BELOW average their food was.  Not worth the wait.  Not worth the energy.  Staff even got mad for two of our group smoking in the \"fire lane\" -- they were standing NOT in a car.  WEIRD.  where are you supposed to smoke during a 30 minute wait?  will never be back.  why is this place soooooo popular I'll never understand."}
{"text":"Just arrived, so far very good service...  ah food arrived!!!  ah so very yummy! Service was relatively fast and friendly..."}
{"text":"What a 'blast from the past'.  I didn't know when I opened the front door that I'd be stepping into a time machine set back to who knows when (I'm not too old!).  The hosts were as nice as their smile and I couldn't help but to scan for Brandon Fraser as I was being led to my seat.  The timeless decor is sure to set the establishments foot print here on then strip for decades to come. 

I arrived with a hungry stomach so I asked the waitress what was their most popular dishes then ordered the two before she could finish describing the entree.  I think it's safe to assume that the chefs could do no wrong when it came to providing breakfast perfection in the heaviest proportion.  If you're a petite, you might want to share.  

Yes, order the lava cake."}
{"text":"Awesome lounge, very creative menu. With a cool atmosphere and great tasting drinks. Love the fire pits and the overall atmosphere. I will definetley be back,"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and it was vey good. The portions were large. I had an omelette and it was delicious. Service was attentive. Didn't go to the bar for a drink but we would have, if it had been later in the day. We peeked in at the bar and it looked awesome, in a time warp sort of way."}
{"text":"we got sat and waited 30 mins and no one came to take our order..."}
{"text":"Had a little date night with the wife in the lounge area of the restaurant the other day. The decor was a 10/10! The service was a 10/10! The drinks were a 27/10! Phenomenal food, drinks and hospitality. A staple in the Las Vegas night life."}
{"text":"The portions are generous and the food's pretty good!  We were seated quickly even though it was packed.  The servers were OK - not as attentive as I prefer but oh well.

It's got a weird vibe... maybe because the decor is from another era but it's kind of interesting, too?  

All that aside, lots of good food for a great price. We weren't complaining!"}
{"text":"Huge omelet, crispy hash browns, delicious waffles and wonderful service. The decor is hilariously dated but it works. Our waitress was really wonderful, I wish I could remember her name to give her credit. The portions were big and tencoat was reasonable. It was worth the walk from the MGM (definitely took the monorail back)!

Oh yeah, the coffee was meh..."}
{"text":"Anything and almost everything you'd want in a coffee shop. Great prices, selection, huge servings and 24 hour. Very \"Vegas\" style, great bar too and great desserts. You can't go wrong here....."}
{"text":"We drove by here Saturday night and, after consulting Yelp, decided to give it a try the next morning for breakfast. The wait was about 30 minutes but it was totally worth it. I got corned beef hash, ball and chain had french toast. Yeah, the hash looked like cat food. So what, it tasted great and there was a ton of it! The french toast was really good, too. Nice and crispy golden brown, just the way you want it. You wont leave here hungry, the portions are huge."}
{"text":"This is the place to go (at least for me) if I want to relax after plodding through the casinos.
The 80's feel is still perfect, and the nachos are incredible. The helping is massive and two people can call it a meal. 

On one occasion, after a bit much to drink, I ordered a chicken fried steak and nachos!  No way! Yes way! Of course it was about 2am and I don't remember what happened after that.... 

I am not a fan of the back parking lot. Creepy. So hope for a spot in the front. 
There is one of those indoor skydiving places within walking distance, but I don't suggest drinking-the nachos and then indoor skydiving."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: awesome! Mellow and chill. They have a great fire pit fountain with TVs above it playing various music vids. 

BLOODY MARY: ordered this for myself--it was just okay even though it looked cool and intricate (had celery, tomato, bacon, pickle, olives). The juice was too tomato-y... could added something else like, more Worcestershire? 

TITO'S & TONIC: typical, nothing special than anywhere else. 

MOJITO: average, not the best. Have tasted better. 

SERVICE: Donna served us--sweet, friendly, and everything you'd expect a server to be :D thanks, Donna!"}
{"text":"Went to Peppermill 2 times on our stay in Las Vegas long wait it well with it food wS great"}
{"text":"We always have a great experience at the Peppermill. We stop by every time we come to Las Vegas. There is rarely a long wait to get seated, the food portions are huge and delicious, and the prices are great. The staff here is always friendly and helpful. I wish I had taken a picture of the pancake my wife had because it was amazingly large. I tried it and it  was delicious. I always have the chorizo and eggs. I really need to try other things, but it so good I can not resist when we come for breakfast. The decor is eclectic and just plain cool-looking. You have to see it for yourself and you definitely should when you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok.. first the things I love about this place.. they are efficient.. the lines are always long because the food is really really good.. the serving size is ridiculous.. the plates can feed 2ppl.. excellent. Every time I've gone there I've had the pleasure of enjoying the ambience and the servers though busy still very attentive.. 
this last time would be the exception. Ms. Elisha was my bone of contention even prior to seating. Her initial look made it seem as if we knew each other and not in a good way.. so the idea that we were seated her area for service seem unreal.. she made us wait without acknowledging our presence at all.. then when she came to take our order she looked over and around us out the window.. still I smile.. when she was done my husband asked me if there was something interesting out the window.. 
when the food was ready it was damn near tossed in the table.. we did not see her again until the receipt was ready.. she literally in passing tossed the receipt on the table almost in my husbands plate.. I stopped smiling at that point.. she saw the expression on my face change.. because I was fed up.. so she did decided to turn around and come back to the table and give some    Insincere ass attempt at service recovery.. but it was too late.. you don't throw things.. and you don't behave as if someone is bothering your ass while you're at work.. I'm only hoping that I'm not subjected to this missy on my next visit.. but they can keep serving bomb food.."}
{"text":"Old Vegas, you have to love it just for that! But the food is good (large portions).  Service is always good.  Bloody Mary's are the BOMB!!! We take our friends & family there when they visit.  I appreciate the history of the place and it's definitely a Vegas landmark that they haven't torn down yet."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great breakfast here on a Thursday early morning. No wait at 730am. As everyone says you get a bit of everything in this place at any hour. We shared a large breakfast with eggs over, fresh toast, sourdough toast, hash browns, bacon, sausage and coffee.  It was all great esp. the hash browns and sourdough bread. Service was spot on.  Prices are not cheap but they give you a lot of food.  Glad two of us split one entree. Try this cool retro high energy landmark. It's worth a stop anytime of day. Cannot wait to return!!"}
{"text":"**this is a review of the fireside lounge**
Giant pink chick drinks with 6 shots and ice cream for $18 ummmm 2 please!! Known for their Scorpion which is kinda like a Mai Tai or for people in the Northwest it is the desert version of the De-railer.  Oh man too bad this is a little north on the strip because this would be my go-to prefunk drink when I am hitting the strip but at least an option for nights at the Wynn or Venetian.  The funny thing is that Rhumbar at Mirage sells Scorpions for $46!! 
The place itself is pretty cool with the fireplace and big comfy chairs with 80's and 90's music videos playing. I did not have any food but they have free peanuts on the table. It is a little small and be careful not to leave the place driving because it is swarming with cops."}
{"text":"The place is still super cool, but the breakfast is mediocre."}
{"text":"Let's get something straight: this place is not about the food.   The portions at the Peppermill are your usual over-sized-Vegas-scale heaps and the quality is neither stellar nor unpalatable; this place is all about the atmosphere.  What a surreal experience.  This place is both trashy and elegant all at once and while the cocktail waitresses wear these wonderfully ironic evening gowns, the place is like a gussied-up diner.  Very Tarantino.  Finish your obscenely large meal (my \"side\" caesar and fettuccine alfredo could have easily fed 2.5 adults... not going to count how many day's calories went  down the hatch on that one), then mosey on into the Fireside for a cocktail in what feels like an early 1980s Central American druglords's den.  I loved it!  It felt like a strip club without the strippers.  The music got so loud at some point that no one sitting with me could actually communicate within a normal decibel range, but I'm pretty sure we were crashing a private party, so I guess I shouldn't complain.  This was definitely a highlight to my Vegas experience."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Ordered the munch's breakfast sans sausage and it was amazing! The eggs were cooked perfectly, hashbrown were crunchy and the veggies were cooked to perfection. Though it was a pretty simple dish, it had such great flavor!! Vegetarians can be very satisfied here! This may have been my favorite place to eat breakfast the whole time in Vegas. Lots of other stuff on the menu too, so a lot of options."}
{"text":"Getting straight to the point the food here is absolutely amazing and we will definitely visit here again when we are in Vegas. 
Just a little background...This was our 1st trip to Vegas and we visited the Peppermill based on a suggestion from my husband's co-worker. 

When we first walked in, the cheap decor and tacky waitresses caught my eye. There were a few of slot machines (of course) crammed in a small corner, neon lights, cheap plastic plants, and waitresses wearing orthopedic shoes. Because the Restaurant sells drinks, they have a \"cocktail waitress\" who was dressed as if she were going to the prom (on a budget). 

We were finally seated after waiting 45 minutes, it was Saturday around noon, so it was to be expected. The service here was not good. The waitress was unattentive and forgetful, however the food is THE BOMB!!!!!! I ordered to Lorraine Omelet and my hubby ordered some sort of scrambler. The food was seasoned to perfection and the portion sizes were ridiculous. I literally ate on my food for 2 days and wound up throwing it away. I ordered a pancake on the side and it was literally the size of a 20' rim.

If you are looking for great food with large portion sizes, this is the place. Although the service sucks (the lady at the checkout counter practically ignored us for a couple of minutes when we were ready to pay our bill), they make up for it with their food."}
{"text":"It feels like walking into an 80's movie about space, Battlestar Galactica, Ice Pirates, or Buck Rogers.  I thought Twikie and the Cylons were going to come out of the back room.  

Instead, what came out was a bunch of waitresses wearing these horrible, ill-fitting, grossly-pastel-colored, school-girl jumpers.  Weird spin on the vibe.

The food was high-end Denny's food.  
All grease.  Total meh.  (The Caesar salad, for instance, was mostly dressing, with a bit of limp lettuce.)  And for the price, \"meh\" is not acceptable.  If I want meh, I can go to MehcDonalds.  (See what I did there?;)

The drinks were water.  
I am not convinced there was any alcohol in their tequila sunrise.   And when you can get $2 well drinks at the Riviera one door down, why go here?

I came here because I'm a local and I understand this is one of the classic Vegas spots... well, walk in, look around, say hi to Twiki, and walk out, because it's not worth staying and paying to eat here."}
{"text":"Sometimes the service is really slow. It happens a lot when I come here. However, I love the food and I love the ambience. It's a great Vegas tradition for me. Late night, mid day it's all good."}
{"text":"Wow! Such an old \"Vegas\" atmosphere with excellent food, service and vibe! Salads are awesome and BIG! Saved this Vegas landmark meal for last, best one this trip! There are so many mediocre, overpriced strip restaurants, but this one is tops fit salads, breakfast and burgers! Casual but swanky and fun! Ask for Al at the counter! It's all yummy!"}
{"text":"Classic peppermill restaurant. Huge food portions and dirty carpet.  Staff is friendly and the food is plain and bland.  Had the Gyro. They missed the mark on the raw chunky onions but the fries were .... well fries.  Also had the cheesesteak. The large rounds of tomatoes can be left off.  That's not a Philly thing.  If your drunk, hungover or both the peppermill gives you want u need."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Peppermill for years. It is by far the best breakfast (drunk or sober) in Las Vegas! Consistently good service and huge food portions!"}
{"text":"Dining at the Peppermill is like dining inside a limo and a secret garden all in one.  Fake flowers and trees, velvet plush walls, lights on walls and waitresses dressed in \"skorts\"!!!!  The portions are huge and they have a vast variety of foods for people with vast dietary needs and wants.  Service is quick, no frills and hugs, but gets the job done."}
{"text":"This is a must go while in Vegas... Open 24 hours and a huge menu. We got off the plane and went straight here. Sat in the fireside room. While we were in there having a few drinks they were filming a talk show. When our table is ready we went out in the main dining room. Food was pretty good and very well priced"}
{"text":"The hotel check-in gentleman recommended this place and I'm glad we came here. My boyfriend and I was starving after getting off the plane so we checked out this place. The service was awesome and the food portions are huge! Definitely worth your money. We ordered the bbq pork ribs with garlic bread and fries and the 10pc mild wings. The food was delicious and we were able to save some for later"}
{"text":"I love the way the waitresses dress it's so classy I had a blue Hawaiian and enjoyed the atmosphere And the old school las vegas feel."}
{"text":"First stop from the airport was the Peppermill! We had an hour wait but new it was worth it!
We sat in the fireside lounge and had a couple of beverages. The Bloody Mary's are the best in town!!
We finally got in and enjoyed the \"Western Fruit Plate\", banana bread and marshmallow crème sauce. The fruit plate is our favorite but we also added a waffle. BIG AND FLUFFY!!
Service is always exceptional and we rested and planned our day with the buz of happy vegas vistors telling their stories of woes and greatness...I LOVE THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"Food: Awesome! My girlfriend and I shared a San Francisco omlet, the biscuits and gravy, and a lemon cranberry muffin.  We loved it!

Portions: Huge!!! I'd definitely recommend sharing one dish with two people. I eat A LOT and I didn't finish my dish. I don't even remember the last time that happened.

Price: about $12-$18 a dish, but one dish could definitely be shared between two people. I don't like spending this much on mediocre food, but am happy to spend it on something great. I thought the food was great, and well worth the price.

Service: solid.

Decor: Very nice! Lots of trees and flowers. Very colorful and scenic."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places to wind down and recover in the wee hours of the morning after a night of partying.  I've never actually been here for breakfast, although I've been here during \"breakfast hours,\" but I have heard their breakfasts are great.

No, it's not new, extremely clean, or filled with gorgeous modern decor, it is more along the lines of Vegas in the 70's, at least everything I can imagine that was good about Vegas in the 70's:)  I once heard that this is one of the oldest operating businesses in Vegas but I'm not sure if that is true.

Their bloody mary's are delicious, the portions are large, and they have a large selection of finger type snack foods,  which is good after a drunkin' or somehow otherwise intoxicated evening:)  The service is always top notch and the waitresses, no matter what age, are all attractive and wear long black dresses.  Yes, that may seem cheesy but personally, I think it is unique and I love it!

Everything from the red velvet seating to the hot tub like fire place contraption to the mirrored walls with christmas looking lights everywhere help add to the perfect \"old school\" Vegas type of experience.

I \"heard\" that lots of \"dancers\" like to hang out here after their shifts are over at the various gentleman's clubs....wink, wink:)"}
{"text":"If you're ever in Las Vegas, Peppermill is the place to have breakfast! The food is super good. The servings are huge so sharing is always good. The atmosphere is great & so is the customer service. A++++"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere inside of here. It's more or less a classic diner, but then in the back there is a fire pit built into the table that we sat at which was different and provided for a beautiful ambiance. Sitting at the table and sipping our drinks was very relaxing and there were many people here on dates or catching up with a friend. The waitresses wore long black dresses which seemed elegant, classic and I thought was interesting. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with the menu. I ordered a chocolate chip martini which was delicious, but I expected it to be a bit more flavorful. My friend ordered a frozen Scooby Doo martini which she did not really enjoy. We shared the appetizer sampler which was huge. It came with breaded chicken, fried shrimp, mozzarella sticks, and onion rings. The food was OK, nothing too crazy. Best items were the mozzarella sticks and the chicken. After about two pieces of food each, we both began to feel very sick and nauseous so we didn't even finish our food. 

Rating this place a four because I thought my drink was good and the atmosphere is just unrivaled and different. Good place to grab a drink and order a lot of food! Open 24 hours which is really awesome!"}
{"text":"Food, decor and ambiance were worth going back for... over and over and over again. Loved it. Only reason I gave it four stars was our waitress didn't check back nearly enough. Forgot the dressing that was supposed to come with my sandwich and we were falling asleep waiting for her to pass by so we could get the check. Finally got up and sought her out myself."}
{"text":"For the all week celebration of a good friends going away, we decided to meet at The Fireside Lounge for drinks and appetizers at Happy Hour.  This place is a Las Vegas icon.  Over the years, many celebrities have frequented the location, including Elvis.  I'm glad that I've visited this place more than once.  

To be honest, though, the look of the place is drab and not really upscale.  The lounge looks like an 80's porn star man cave.  Full of mirrors, blue and purple low dim lighting, a fire pit in the middle of the lounge.  Thank goodness it's a historic location of Las Vegas.  

My drinks were about $5-$10, including beer and vodka sodas.  For the appetizers, we got a crap load.  I'll just list them and give a little bit of my opinion:

-Shrimp Cocktail for $12.95:  Nothing glamorous, cocktail sauce is tangy, lots of shrimp given.

-Chicken Quesadillas for $11.50:  served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  Your standard quesadilla, again nothing stand out!

-Chicken Nachos for $16.25:  Lots of items.  This was a huge plate but the cheese hardened quickly.  Sides included jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, onions and black olives.

-Bruschetta for $8.25:  tomatoes, basil, garlic, onions, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese, served on toasted herb focaccia bread.  This was actually flavorful and moist.  One of my favorites!

-Chicken fingers for $10.25:  Your standard pub fingers.  Kind of dry.

-Caprese salad for $8.95:  Sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and drizzled with balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil.  The slices were thick and grouped together, it was delicious!

I know I'm missing some of the items but we literally got a few of each of these plates.  Our group was pretty big!  At the end of the day, it was your standard pub food.  Nothing that really blew me away.  I would go back because of the status of this historic icon."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always a great place to visit when in Vegas. I would even go as far as to say
\"You should never leave Vegas before eating at the Peppermill\"."}
{"text":"Delicious food with many options! Portion size us huge! So many options that you could come here every day for a month and not try the same thing twice. The country fried steak is amazing! The service is good most of the times."}
{"text":"Omg what a savior! Came here after a pool party in the wee hours of the morning and had fish and chips with a Bloody Mary. Best Bloody Mary I had in Las Vegas by far!! Huge fan. Decor is a little over the top and Corny but this is a great spot to grab food 24/7. Huge selection as well! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I discovered this place through a friend and I thought this was a hidden gem. Each time I go to Vegas, I always go to Peppermill's. The atmosphere is pretty cozy and welcoming. When you go inside, it almost looks like it used to be a strip club. I like the variety in the menu and each time I've had something different and I have no complaints yet. I don't know why, but I'm always amused by their sugar; it's very patriotic looking. This is the place I'd go to the morning after."}
{"text":"It's a horrible place - if you're Mormon. Celebrities, drag queens, prostitutes, and good old fashioned folks from Iowa havin' a good time. Got it around 3:00 AM if your pacemaker's battery is fresh..."}
{"text":"Pretty good, especially if you're hungover. Gigantic portions, decent prices, great service, tacky atmosphere, cocktails that will make you holla and the wait wasn't bad at all. I ordered the corned beef hash, which is the junky stuff and that made us happy. I only wished it came with some rice, but omg the blueberry muffin was bombbbbb. We all shared a stack of pancakes and to be honest it felt a little flat to me. It was tough and just didn't hit the spot for me, although they were large and looked delicious."}
{"text":"Peppermill is a Las Vegas must-do.

If you go on the weekends in the morning, you're waiting an hour. It's just how it is. During the week, you can pretty much be seated right away.

They happen to have some of the best country gravy I've ever had. Portions are big and the price is quite fair.

My girlfriend loves the corned beef hash.

Wear stretchy pants, or have some self control...so wear stretchy pants."}
{"text":"Who doesn't go to The Peppermill when they are in Las Vegas?? I've had many happy times here. Falling asleep on the table while waiting for my breakfast.. lol 
My friend from Vegas always set out this place as a meeting place. :-) 
Good chance for me to grab the TEN EGGS OMELET! Heeeeheee, I always get high on protein after it. But of course I share with my buddies. 
Huge portion, nice employees, 24 hrs!!"}
{"text":"We had an awesome girls' day-date here and also ate here afterward. I had a decent time here. They make a decent Bloody Mary and whiskey/splash of ginger ale. I would definitely come back and have another girl's day!"}
{"text":"3 Stars because our hostess was rude and...read below

This was our first time here. We walk in. No hostess at the stand. 2 of them talking amongst each other arguing... what were they arguing about? They were arguing about which one of them was going to seat us. We can here them. \"Its your turn!\" ... \"No, its your turn!\" ....  Im already getting a bad vibe. My wife ask them...\"Should we just seat ourselves?\" The hispanic looking one acts like she didnt see us.. \"Oh im sorry, how many in your party?\"
Finally seated. Our waiter, waitress and another guy was really nice.. no problems with them or the food. 

So half way through our food a family shows up. Ok cool, cute kids. A few minutes pass by, kids know everyone there. They walk in the back as they please. I see another waitress holding a baby trying to put it to sleep. I know this is a place of business, a restaurant business not a day care. It looked very unprofessional. 

As im paying the bill (have to take the tab by the entrance) and there are slot machines. More kids and they're sitting in front of the slot machines. Some climbing on the chairs. I thought it was illegal to have kids sitting at any slot machine inside any place of business if they're underage (trust me the kids weren't older than 7 yrs old).

Great portioned sized food. Fairly priced. Just not somewhere I think I'll eat again. 

I dont know,  just my observations.  They'll be closed the first week of Sept 2014."}
{"text":"(7-26-17)
Pass here all the time. Finally decided to check it out. Excellent food. Nice size portions. 
Staff very friendly and hard workers. Staff's uniforms very colorful. Cocktail waitresses in fancy dresses.
Love the trees in the middle of the restaurant.
Clean restrooms.
Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is Great for Families.

There aren't many places on the Strip my wife and I like to bring the kids, but The Peppermill is one place my wife and I like to bring the family for lunch that serves up great diner fare and tremendously big portions of classic Vegas ambiance.

(A note here about the Fireside Lounge. It's awesome, and if you're looking for a weird place for a drink that isn't in a casino, it's really a must-visit. Fire pits and scorpion bowls. Awesome. But keep in mind, adults only.)

The Peppermill is a restaurant of all booths, and other than high-chairs and the chairs along the counter, there isn't a single free-standing chair in the whole place. Vegas is all about making everyone feel special, and as everyone loves a booth, everyone gets one. And like I mentioned, they do provide the standard restaurant high-chairs that pull up to the end of the booth. All the tables are normal table height, so there's no problem accommodating very young eaters.

The menu is similar to the best of NYC diners. Namely, there's almost anything on it, from eggs to fried chicken to steak to pancakes. As for the kids menu, it's small and very basic. There are chicken fingers, mac and cheese with fruit, grilled cheese, bacon and eggs, french toast and the very awesome pancake face. The prices are very reasonable (all the kids menu items are either $5.95 or $6.95) and if your child is older or more adventurous they can of course order from the complete adult menu. And don't forget, you're in Vegas so The Peppermill is open 24 hours, 7 days a week including all holidays. 

As for the service, here in Las Vegas we have pretty high standards, and in the seven years I've been going there I've never had anything but an outstanding waitress who has been super friendly to my kids.

The Peppermill is the perfect combination of good food and outstanding Vegas kitsch."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this is the rare time yelp failed me. The food here sucks plain and simple it sucks I had salmon with alfredo the sauce was gross the salmon was over cooked. I also had two eggs scrambled and it was straight up Denny's style w no flavor all. Even the service was mediocre just wasn't impressed expected at least OK food with all the good reviews didn't even get that. Save yourself the time and money (way too costly for quality) and yelp a mom and pop breakfast spot off the strip you'll get better tasting food with better prices and customer service....oh and the \"type\" of people that were here when we came?????.... Pure ghetto I'll leave it at that. I don't want to get interrupted by ghetto hooligans trying to get my number while I'm eating my nasty food no thanks yelp you can keep this place I WONT BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Greatest restaurant on the Las Vegas strip. Amazing prices and amazing portions.  Love the food. Buffalo wings are the best.  Love eating here."}
{"text":"This place is waaaaay over hyped! I found this place on yelp and decided to go on Christmas Day! We walked in and as expected, there was a long line to be seated. That was ok since it's Christmas and there are a lot of big parties waiting to sit. But we finally get seated and the booth was nice and roomy and the decorations looked like something out of pulp fiction when they go to the diner with the cars, very colorful with trees inside the dining room and even colorful sugar on the table. We had 4 (yes I'm not exaggerating) ask for our drink order from the bar! I get it that's a money maker. We order a bloody marry and it arrives 5 min later. It was ok. Nothing to write home about. 
Our waiter comes over and introduces himself (really laying it on thick for the tip no less) and again I get it! It Christmas and he's working so he might as well make money. But then he tells us to look over the menu and that hell be back in a few min! 20 min later after I've asked several of the bus boys to call over our waiter, he shows up and takes our order. I guess he could tell from my facial expression that I was pissed so he kept a smile on his face and took our orders fast. We order the appetizer sampler (fried shrimp, fried chicken fingers, onion rings, bruschetta, and cheese sticks), buffalo chicken wrap and nachos. The sampler was decent, the wrap too but the nachos were awful! I huge plate full of chips, a little bit of semi melted cheese, raw onions and a lot of black olives emptied from a can right on too!!!! It was just awful (baja fresh and la salsa have way better nachos). 
It came with a side (small in comparison to how much chips was in the plate ) of sour cream and old (brown guacamole) for almost $16!!!!! 
So we ate a little bit of this and that Just kind of picking on the plates and finally decided it was time to go! We asked for a few boxes and the check! The waiter comes back and is completely confused as to the drink we ordered. He kept asking us if we ordered a sunrise something and I kept telling him NO! That all we ordered was the bloody marry and it was still on the table. He tried to help us pack the nachos and just broke the chips by pushing it down to try to make it fit. On our check we were charged for the sunrise something and I wanted to flag the guy down and tell him but my husband was so over it that we just paid and left!

All in all, go here only if you're hungover, have the munchies or don't care AT ALL what you put into your body! I can't for the life of me figure out all these good reviews. I'm usually very easy going but that was one of the most awful experiences in a restaurant /diner that I've had with both food and service. You're only paying for the decorations/ ambiance! 
Don't waste your time and money here. There was way better local places to try! The 2 stars are for the ambiance and cute colored sugar on the table! That's it!!! Good luck!"}
{"text":"I went here with my friends while we were hungover and the food was great. The pictures were awesome too and memories were definitely made here. It's a classic brunch/lunch type of restaurant and it's conveniently located on the strip."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and usually the service and food are good but today I wouldn't brag about anything. The dinner started off with bad service. Waited over 30 minutes for a server to come to our table and they only came because we had to ask a bus boy if we had a server.  Then we ordered and it seemed like the waitress didn't know anything we were talking about when we talked about the food. My girlfriend ordered the clam chowder as an starter and it was cold, completely bland and the potatoes inside were under cooked. I got the tomato caprese stack and the cheese seemed to have been sitting out for a while before it was brought to our table. Dinner food took an additional 30 minutes to come out even though the restaurant wasn't busy. Dinner food was okay but nothing compared to usual. Very disappointed with the service and food we received today."}
{"text":"Boom! All the changes in Vegas over the years ( remember Sahara, Stardust,Aladdin...be careful circus circus you may be next) and this place has remained the quintessential go to spot for 3AM, 4AM breakfast. Food is always good , but lets face it, at 3,4,5 AM do you reeeealy care about how breakfast tastes? You're just glad you are eating something ...a grilled rat from the construction site next door would do. This is THE spot to go for 
b-fast after a long night of clubbing, gambling and debauchery. Wish they had rental beds to sleep off the meals. Don't ever go away big P!!!!"}
{"text":"oops - it wasn't Las Vegas, it was Reno.  But if this one is half as good it still deserves a 5-state"}
{"text":"My love of the Peppermill's Fireside Lounge is true.  If you like the vibe of retro/old school/neon, but real, you will love this place.  The red velvet booths, the sunken flaming fountain, the low ceiling and the tasty cocktails make this a fun night on the seedy end of the strip. Easy walk from the Wynn and the Encore, but a million miles away in cool.

Order some kind of vintage cocktail, settle back into the velvet couch and enjoy Vegas of a bygone era.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great breakfast at one of the last free standing restaurants on the Strip! Historic \"Peppermill\" where they film Casino with DeNiro, Hangover and others! Our waitress Jennifer was so nice and helpful the our family from Brazil. The food was awesome and the eggs Benedict 10+. If you're in Vegas a must breakfast stop!!! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. My sister and I tried the gyro sandwich and \"the conquest\" sandwich. Both were really good! The potato salad that comes as a side is absolutely delicious. Service was a little slow but that was because they were sooo busy !  I have nothing negative to say about my visit."}
{"text":"Guy Fieri - I trusted you, but this place was a misstep. I saw a Vegas episode of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives a couple of weeks before going on vacation and The Peppermill was featured. I couldn't wait to try it. Big mistake. 

We went in the early afternoon during a week day. It was busy and I took that as a good sign. We patiently waited as people in the waiting area were seated. But, as the time passed, we were not getting seated. Party after party of 2,3,4,5,6 people, who came in after us, were seated. We spoke to the hostess who said it would be a couple more minutes. Again, people just coming into the restaurant are being seated almost immediately. 

We eventually did get seated and I was hoping the food would turn this into a positive experience. Nope. Yes, the portions are big. However, having a lot of food is pointless when the food does not taste good.  I got a BBQ Burger- it was dry and the BBQ sauce had a weird taste to it. Someone in my party ordered breakfast, so I tasted the hash browns. They were half cooked and flavorless.

The service was ok. The waitresses looked miserable.  It didn't seem like they had enough people working. The downside of having an open kitchen is that when you're sitting nearby, you can hear all of the staff complaints and arguments.

Definitely would not return or recommend."}
{"text":"These people operate a tow truck scam, saw them tow two vehicles in less than 30 minutes. they have a flier taped to their door that says they're not involved, but it's their security guard who is calling the tow trucks. $300 to get your car out - why not focus on being a better restaurant, instead of scamming tourists?"}
{"text":"Nachos, nachos, nachos... that's all you need to know and all you need to order.

Everything else was good but not great.

Cool diner vibe with friendly staff and interesting colors!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Breakfast was spot on!!!  Drink were great as well. Really enjoyed the chicken fry, crab cake eggs Benedict and omelettes were huge. Great place to grab food"}
{"text":"Let's see - a fun and friendly atmosphere, large portions of delicious food, tasty drinks served by a bona fide cocktail waitress, and all at reasonable prices. What's NOT to like?!

Ok, maybe the Vegas locale, on the north end of the strip and away from the more posh atmosphere of Tao and a million Wolfgang Puck spinoffs, isn't for everyone. But then again, Peppermill is right across the street from Circus Circus and right next to the Riviera, and away from the worst of the Strip traffic.

My girlfriend and I went to Peppermill on the recommendation of a friend, someone who lives here in Las Vegas, always a good sign. Once you enter the place, you're immediately struck by a cunning mix of modern and retro, neon lighting in a darkened room, and waitresses in bright colours and miniskirts. 

We were seated quickly and immediately introduced to our waitress, who was friendly and helpful, and soon followed by the cocktail waitress, dressed to the nines in a flowing black dress but still very comfortable. She helped us choose drinks and returned with them fast, checking on us several times throughout the meal.

My girlfriend got a grasshopper and I tried a Blue Hawaiian, big and fruity and bright blue - it also packed a good kick. No watering down here, I guess!

For our meals, she tried the pork chops and eggs, which came with a generous portion of hash browns and a muffin, while I tried the pastrami burger with (I was delighted to find) curly fries. We finished off with an \"Elegant Brownie,\" a positively massive dessert of warm brownie, hot fudge, and vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream and a cherry. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection - a little bit of pink in the middle of my medium burger, eggs with just slightly runny yolks, crispy fries and hashbrowns, and a delightfully messy dessert that was plenty for two to share.

And the whole meal, drinks and dessert included, came in at just about $50 all told. Not bad at all for a wonderful experience and a whole lot of great food.

If you're in Vegas, you owe it to yourself...it may be a little off the main drag, but the Peppermill is well worth the trip. As for us, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"always a classic. You really can't go wrong. Great food - HUGE portions - consistent service through the years... and that fireplace in the back!  Wow - can't beat that.  And it's been a great gathering spot since the last century."}
{"text":"Nice place on the strip. Has a great reputation and plenty of service people. All the dishes look great!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about The Peppermill. A work colleague and I discovered this place while researching new places to eat during a convention. We ended up eating here at least one meal every day of the trip. Excellent service, extremely generous portions and exceptional food. It's no wonder this place has been around so long. The atmosphere itself is a mix between a 70s lounge and an 80s arcade. Very cool. Plus they serve liquor, which is a huge plus. I found the Bloody Mary, while quite generous in size, a little lacking in flavor for my tastes. The Coronaritas however were completely awesome. Enjoyed a few of them in the Fireside Lounge while awaiting our table on several occasions. Portions were huge and we couldn't believe how reasonably priced everything was compared to the hotel restaurants further down the strip. We'll definitely be putting this place into the rotation on our next trip."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place,  ita dark to chill and bright to stay lively! The colors are appealing and food is decent,  its your top shelf dennys!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here for some late night eating and I got to say, worst sandwich I've ever had in my life. we got the mozzarella with tomato sandwich. It was just what you read. Cold ass tomato and cold ass mozzarella. Not grilled or even warmed up or anything. I forced myself to eat half before I was sure I was going to vomit.
The only great thing about this place is the colorful sugar I kept snacking on through the whole visit, and their gigantic ice cream sundae. Now that is what dreams are made of."}
{"text":"I had never been here before, and the few times that I have driven by I've always thought it was probably a strip joint as the windows are dark, and have those stereotypical, the purple and pink neon lights.  My wife, had mentioned this is one of her favorite places because of the rainbow sugar.  I figured might as well try out a new place...so i took her word for it and came in for a bite.

Once inside, it looks even more like a strip joint than it did outside.  We walked in through the lounge area in the back...it's very dark, more Neon Purple and Pink lighting, that thick black carpeting and mirrored ceiling. Once through the lounge and into the restaurant, there was more lighting though the strip joint ambiance looks like it mated with a family friendly restaurant and gave birth to what is Peppermill.

Our orders were taken, and our meals were served with in a few short minutes.  The food portions where pretty gnarly (at lest for what we got) and I definitely well worth it's price.

I look forward to my next dining experience here."}
{"text":"how can you not love peppermill? portions are huge, quality is like diner food. funky retro interior is the real reason you go. my sister and I shared a club sandwich with onion rings and we still had food left over. so even though it seemed like a pricey sandwich it really was a ton of food. it can get very busy for late breakfast. i think they're open 24 hours and have a full bar. the servers are nice and pretty chill, especially if it's not busy."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan of @PeppermillVegas .  Cool local flavor up in this joint.

This is a great example of local flavor as well as what happens when you take a diner and rub some funk on it.

I recommend the pastrami burger, although it is a 1/2 pound of beef, a little more than I go for but it was delicious and I will likely return for another go 'round when I'm in Vegas again.

The service was very good...almost too good, but not quite."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch because it was walking distance from the Springhill Suites. It was almost noon, but the place was packed with people, some of whom were drinking enormous cocktails. The cocktail waitress was scantily clad, and there was another woman with few clothes on offering to take pictures of couples and groups sitting at their banquettes. 

The service was fine. I had a \"Cobb Salad,\" which was more like a chef's salad (no egg, no bleu cheese, but both turkey AND ham), but which was so large it came in something resembling a porcelain horse trough. I could only finish half of it and I felt bad about the waste of food. Total cost for my lunch, including my diet coke, was around $20. While this is more than I like to pay for lunch, I feel like I got my money's worth, between the dark-and-neon decor and the people-watching. If you are going to Las Vegas, go there once."}
{"text":"We stopped breakfast ordered chicken fried steak and eggs great  wife loved the gravy we will come back again super fast service and kept my coffee cup full"}
{"text":"This place would get a better rating from me if it wasn't for the ridiculous wait & \"okay\" crab benny.  

I heard rave reviews so we dropped in for breakfast.  There was literally a line out the door!   We got our name on the list and we're told 45 mins.  They also have bar stool type seating but you have to keep an eye out if a seat beak comes available.  About 30 minutes into our wait, we found seating at the bar.  

The perks; the food portions are enormous!   They're known for their traditional breakfasts - pancakes, waffles, sausages etc. I ordered the crab benny.  Hubby order pancakes.  My order came with THREE eggs & was entirely covered with a \"hollandaise\" sauce that had a slight curry flavor.  Way, way too much sauce for my liking. I couldn't taste anything but the sauce.  Hubby was happy with his pancakes.  The folks next to us, who we struck up a conversation with, ordered the pancake combo and shared!  It was huge!  One sausage link is twice the size of what \"normal\" restaurants serve. 

I would stick with what their known for.  If I go next time, maybe I'd follow \"The Munch\" recommendation!  Ps. You can call ahead for reservations.  I would be safe and plan a day or two ahead."}
{"text":"My 100th review! Perfect that it's for a restaurant with a flare.

Loved the decor in here. It was like neon overload, I just loved it. Food was dependable and I'd like to eat there again next time I'm in town. I had the Reuben with curly fries. Cherry Pepsi, and a chocolate brownie for dessert. Had an amazing time."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting a great steak considering we were having dinner at 11:00 at night, but boy was I pleasantly surprised!   Our ribeye was cooked to absolute perfection.   We were so pleased with our meal that we gave our compliments to the manager and he personally brought the chef out to our table.   You just don't find good customer service like this anymore.   I give 5 stars on every account:  food, service, quality of food (excellent), and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Barney exploded all over a Denny's in 1980's Vegas with fake trees and flowers, indoor fire pits, neon, and mirrors.

Note:  this is a breakfast review (served 24 hours a day) based on 20+ visits.

Come hungry.  1lb flame grilled, bone in ham steak and three eggs and half dinner plate serving of crispy hash browns (or  pile of toast, giant muffin, or entire bagel with cream cheese).  Not enough eggs? add a side of additional three eggs for just $3.95.  Eggs Benedicts with not two but THREE poached eggs atop a split English muffin, a pile of Canadian bacon, buttery hollandaise and those incredible hash browns again.

Giant omelets folded and filled with a wide range of staples from chicken or turkey breast, sausage, or shrimp to artichokes, fresh spinach, peppers and tomatoes all made gooey with  jack, cheddar, provolone, parm, or even feta cheese.  Zero complains.

Greasy spoon French toast made from thick slices of Texas toast quick dipped in a cinnamon, vanilla custardy mixture.  Three eggs, two strips of bacon two link sausages sit alongside.   The carbcakes, errr, pancakes, 14\" giants.  Three golden, fluffy, buttermilk disks that hit the spot.  As a combo, add the two eggs, bacon and sausages.

Go during daylight hours and it will always be crowded.

Tip:  Put your name on the list, and go to the lounge, light up a machine for $20 and play some video poker or keno to pass the time as you enjoy a giant, spicy bloody Mary (lubing the system or hair of the dog).  Don't forget your 10 percent tip for the bartender if you hit.

Very friendly diner service.

Sure, nothing is specially sourced, nothing heirloom or organic, no claims about hormones or non GMO.  Sulfates, nitrates, phosphates abound but so what?  Eggs and bacon always cooked to order (ie over easy, extra crispy).  The great American breakfast, Vegas style lives on."}
{"text":"Cool retro interior. Food was good.  Senior menu was a good deal. Had the Tostada Omelet  was big enough to split..add jalapeños of corse."}
{"text":"Awesome drinks and food! A little crowed at times, but well worth the wait. 
With the new hotel across the street coming up this place would benefit any type of enlargement."}
{"text":"This is a good place if you're looking for the \" a little better than IHOP \" place on the strip. I went there on a weekend with my husband, and we had to wait about 35 minutes around 11am. There were a lot of tourists there so the wait wasn't too bad. Although I was starving...

My husband and I shared french toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, and potatoes. I thought the french toast was okay, but my husband loved it. Everything else was pretty good. The coffee was really strong, but I love strong coffee. The atmosphere is definitely interesting. The service was pretty good. Our waitress was very friendly and pretty attentive. I would go there again, but it's a 20 minute drive from where I live, and I like sticking closer to home. If you're on the strip visiting, I would recommend it for an early morning after party place. There seemed to be quite a bit of people there that looked like they had a rough night."}
{"text":"Someone else called this place overpriced, but it's waaaaaaayyyy cheaper than most of the hotel steakhouses now.  You can get a steak here for $29.50 max, and that's with shrimp scampi.  We ended up going here instead of eating at the steakhouse in the Paris, where a steak was $40.  Of course, you could probably eat at IHOP or Denny's for cheaper, but we wanted to go someplace that we'd never been to.

We were blown away by the shiny ceilings, neon, flamingo lamps, and the goofy trees all over.  I would say it's worth it just to see the decor.  

They have a cocktail waitress that never came to our table, which was really annoying.  We had six people that wanted to drink, so I guess it was their loss.  

The food came in shockingly vast quantities and most of us left with our plates still half full of food.  We ordered two breakfasts, two steaks, and one pasta dish and everyone enjoyed their meal.  I have no idea if we'll be back unless someone in our party hasn't seen the place, as the food is really just diner food, but it's a good place to experience if you're dying for something that is typical Las Vegas and worth taking photos of."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant in January. I don't know why people feel obligated to rate this place so high?! The food is not good at all. They serve it cold, the sauce dripping from the side of the plate. Our waiter was cranky with two tables and super nice to another one. Just because we had accent and the other table were Japanese. But the other table were Southern! He even followed us to see how much tip we gave!!!"}
{"text":"This seems to be a local touristy spot for diner food at the end of the strip. We hit it up and had a great time. The food was fantastic and we had great service too. It was a unique place with an outstanding menu and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Disco brunch!

I love how in Vegas everything is neon and looks like a slot machine.  I have never been to one but I bet even the laundromats in vegas make you stoked to put your quarters in the slot, cuz you just might win!  Win getting your clothes clean that is!

Anyways, back to the peppermill.  This place was so awesome.  Neon, glamorous, chromey interior. Just the thing you need after you've been at a gentlemen's club till 7am that same morning.   So you hit the Peppermill.  It's nice and cool, and darkly lit, and the waitresses are really chill.  They serve HUGE bloody marys and mimosas.  (The bloodies need more horseradish though.)   

Food portions are huge and the menu is extensive.  You will definitely find something to eat here.  

there is even a lounge in the back with a cool fire pit you can sit by if you want even more of the hair of the dog.   

This is a great place to go to re-calorize for your flight home.   A fitting end to a great vegas weekend!"}
{"text":"If you wake up one morning in Vegas and wonder to yourself what's Vegas like back in the days, you should definitely take yourself (and bring a friend or two with you just in case you got lost in the time warp) to this Las Vegas almost landmark.  The decor of the place and the uniform of the staff are cheesier than a deep dish pizza. Fake cherry blossom trees aside, the pantyhose on those waitress are seriously reflective!

Like any restaurant, not everything on the menu is good, and not every waiting staff is attentive all the time; I had some hit and miss experiences with this place with both the food and service, hence the 3 stars.

Check it out nonetheless, it'll bring you back to the good old days =)"}
{"text":"I heard good reviews and I didn't know it was a tourist spot.  However it is a tourist spot. The wait was 35 minutes on a Friday morning. The portion size is huge, items start around $14.95 and there is a variety to meet your needs. I shared a garden omelet and was full, it came with hash browns and a bagel. The French toast were sooo good. Chicken sausage is available which was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Breakfast! I got the oatmeal. It was the biggest bowl of oatmeal I ever saw. Generous bowl of hot oatmeal with bananas, walnuts and raisins. It also comes with a side of brown sugar and a little milk to add if you like. 

The omelettes were HUGE! It looked like a dozen eggs went into those babies! So much food! Much cheaper than eating at a hotel and just a short Uber ride from the strip. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Peppermill is always good. Been here about 4 times.   Atmosphere it old school Las Vegas. This is a great place to go after seeing a show. Usually order breakfast large portions.  I have also had burger also very good."}
{"text":"Nostalgic,Get an Omelette...they're frickin delicious.Servers are awesome, lounge is relaxed it doesn't even feel you're at a breakfast spot.One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas Hands Down."}
{"text":"Wow. Who would have thought there would be a good decent price breakfast place by the strip. True gem located right next to the Riviera Hotel. (: Does big portions and good prices reel you in? 

My fiance and I were craving brunch but somewhere cheap and not overpriced (like most places on the strip). I'm actually surprised he found this place because it's not one of the first things to pop up. Anyways we came here around 10:30AM on a Friday and it was pretty busy. 

The scenery totally draws you in. It's dark with neon purple blue lights running with fake trees and plants. Totally unexpected, but it was nice.  Even the table had some colorful sugar! You can always ask for plain sugar though. (:  Oh and the seats are all mostly booth seats. Yay. 

The food. Wow. Seriously. Did I mention big portions? My boyfriend got one of their specialty omelettes and I got the Belgium Waffle (can I be anymore boring?). Anyways, the omelette came in a huge plate with depth, and 3 slices of toast. Big. Filling. Delicious. I wish I had gotten an omelette. Belgium Waffle. So crisp and so fluffy. Minus the fact I had to scoop off the huge amount of butter on it since I forgot to ask for it on the side. Yea presentation of the food may not be the best, but at least you know you're getting the best for your dollar. (:

Service. The lady at the front was so nice! She starts conversation and attends to you ASAP. The waitresses wear these old school uniforms, and work fast. So you can expect to get your food quickly. 

I'll be coming back here for breakfast/brunch if I stay on the strip. Better than waiting in line at those over priced brunch/breakfast places on the strip."}
{"text":"This place is a brisk 15 minute walk (in the sweltering heat) from the Trump Int'l Hotel. Just go to the strip and then walk north. I miss my local Peppermill that was in Cupertino (right by Apple), so it's always a bit nostalgic to come in and see. 

The place is just a snazzy, super Vegas diner, with quick service. There was a bit of a wait, but you can go into the lounge for a cocktail while you'r waiting for a table. I had a mimosa, and my friend had a very awesome Bloody Mary. Nice 'n spicy.

I had the corned beef hash. It was good. The portion was ginormous. I had it for an early morning snack the next morning (thank goodness for the kitchenettes in the Trump!)

All the details of this place are super fun. There's colored sugar in the sugar dispenser. There's fun neon. There's fake trees. What more can you ask for when in Vegas?"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. They have a fire pit on water in the lounge and such a relaxed environment. The drinks were so sweet and we ordered the nachos for an appetizer which were enough to fill 4 people up. It was delicious and I definitely recommend for anyone looking for a great hole in the wall."}
{"text":"This is a broke pimps paradise. Upset doesnt even describe the feeling I had once I left.  I was soo looking forward to coming to this place and enjoying the huge fruit platter! Unfortuntely before even gettIng my fruit platter I was served nasty banana bread that wasnt even cooked but apparently it was according to the new bread cook and server. I just feel like the fruit platter should have been free if I was served bad food. Now the fruit platter came out and everything seemed like it was hanging out in the desert. Also it's served on wilted lettuce. For the finale I couldnt even touch the raw onion rings or muster the courage to eat fried shrimp. Tomatoes on the sampler platter were black. Overall would never go back. Ps I want my money back !"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place to eat in Vegas.  

I always get breakfast so that is the only thing on which I can advise you.

Everything I've ever eaten here has been delicious.  This last time I got the crab eggs benedict meal.  Crab, poached egg, hollandaise, english muffin.  

I took a group of fellow realtors here after our last day of a convention and everyone loved their food.  

They are good portions as well. 

The service is stellar every time I am there.  They have cocktail waitresses and separate food waitresses.  

If there is a wait to be seated you can sit in the fireside lounge and have a beverage.  They'll bring your drink to your table if your table becomes ready before you get your drink.

Food doesn't take forever to come out of which I am a fan.  

Even other people who patron the place are nice and want to converse with you.  I guess good food, good service, and quick service will do that to you.

Anyway, go here!
I don't leave Vegas without visiting."}
{"text":"Our spot for late night dessert when family comes in town. Convenient and lots of easy free parking. Keep wanting to try something other than the hot fudge sundae but always end up ordering the sundae. Big enough to share but you will want one all to yourself."}
{"text":"it is always nice to visit the peppermill, especially after a night of heavy drinking :)  the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because our waitress was kinda of a bi**h.  she had attitude, she would slide stuff across the table, she didnt bring us any condiments.  The bus boy had to get our sodas and our syrup.  the sampler platter was good it came with chicken strips, mozarella sticks, bruchetta, fried shrimp, and onion rings. All the food was pretty good, its just the service they have to work on"}
{"text":"First time here- this place is really swanky- think back to the movies you'd see in the 70's that were Vegas style! We came for breakfast and it was really good, diner style setting, good price and good service. We will be back for sure, they are popular so a bit of a wait, 40 minutes or so but worth it. Be sure to check out the fireside lounge...SWANKY!"}
{"text":"The food was yummy, the location was rather interesting, the staff was okay, but the wait was awful.

The outside makes it look like a classic diner. However once inside you'll see its true appeal. It literally looked like a strip club but was missing the most essential aspect of it, a pole! That could've, would've been nice! 

The front end was nice and did a great job dealing with all the hangry (hungry and angry) people. However, the service was a bit off once we were seated. It took a while for our waitress to make her way to us which is understandable given that they were swamped but we had been waiting for 50+ minutes and could've used a refreshment right off the bat.

Our orders came out all together which was nice; none of that awkward waiting and watching for others to get their plates. I got the Eggs Benedict which was pretty good and priced at at about $13. I liked how the hollandaise sauce tasted. It was a bit tangier than others I've had in the past.  The eggs were poached nicely and ran lovely through my crispy hashbrowns. My friends tried numerous things such as the club sandwich, the BLAT sandwich, and an omelette all of which was pleasing.  

Overall, definitely not a bad option if you're in Vegas and want something yummy and fun for breakfast. However, if there's a long wait I wouldn't bother. I personally, didn't think it was worth the 50+ minutes we waited to just get seated. I did think the lounge was a fun place and wouldn't mind stopping by there for a pregame drink."}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to go into the lounge but the restaurant had an eclectic mix of people.  Families, couples, party people, tourists....
We will definitely go back!  Food was very good!
I had the reuben and my boyfriend had the bacon cheeseburger.  We both enjoyed both, except I think I liked his a little more.  I'll definitely get some kind of breakfast next time or a burger.
We also had plans to get a sundae after dinner but the portions were so large we were too full, so maybe next time."}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us had breakfast here early in the morning after drinks.  The food was good and surprisingly very inexpensive.  It's rare that i find a good breakfast place with turkey sausage so i was impressed. We were seated immediately and our food came really quick. I will be dining here again when we return."}
{"text":"I came here with my buddy before we were going home from a great weekend of partying and gambling.  We stayed at the Riviera and we always saw this 24-hour restaurant with a huge crowd.  It reminded me of the Denny's in my local town.  I read some of the reviews on yelp and we made our way here before the drive home.

Great breakfast! I had Joe's San Francisco Special.  It's a fat omelet with onions, potatoes, cheese, spinach, and lots of meat.  You get one side which is a choice of toast, blueberry muffin, or a bran muffin.  I chose the blueberry muffin.  It was fresh from the oven and tasted delicious!  The prices are not bad and the food is great.  I'll definitely want to try their lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends late Friday night and soon regretted not grabbing tacos instead.

Our waitress (Jaime?) gave us the most unwelcoming greeting I had ever received from a restaurant and impatiently took down our orders. For the remainder of our meal, she was barely around and we kept having to look around to find her and get the check.

My boyfriend and I shared the Swiss & Mushroom burger, and it wasn't bad but it's not at all worth mentioning and doesn't come close to redeeming the restaurant for its poor service.

+1 star because the restaurant is cutely decorated like a 70s diner."}
{"text":"Huge portions- super fun. Came here for dinner... but I suspect it is 1000x more awesome at 2 am after too many drinks. I will have to come back to find out."}
{"text":"NUMBER OF VISITS: 1

WOULD I COME BACK? If I was really hungry and there was nowhere else to eat. 

I guess the reason why this place is rated high is because of the interesting lounge that's attached to it, it's open 24/7 and the portions are generous. It's basically an upscale Denny's. 

FOOD CONSUMPTION:

CORNED BEEF HASH: It's average. Nothing great, nothing bad. Nothing exciting about it. (2.5 stars)

PANCAKES: 3 ginormous pancake order with the size bigger than my hand! It's similar to one you would get at Denny's. Tastes like flour, eggs and water. Doesn't melt in your mouth. I guess that's why they give  you huge servings of margarine and syrup (cause you know they're not serving you real butter) (1.5 stars)

Nothing much else to say about this place. It was packed on a Saturday morning with hungry people. The service was ok....as in our server was friendly, but other employees I may have asked something for were not."}
{"text":"Order the onion rings, it's the best thing you'll get here.
Everything else we ordered was less than stellar.  Staff was non-existent for the most part and it wasn't even that busy, not sure where they went.
We only went here because it was close to our hotel and after walking all day with two kids in tow they wanted to eat instead of driving somewhere.  Should have crossed the street and had fast food.  This was overpriced for what we got."}
{"text":"Many a relaxed night post-work was spent here years ago...

A recent rendezvous with an old coworker proved it the same, esp considering the nostalgia of old times sitting in the same booth-like tables with old friends.

After ordering a couple moderately priced drinks, the inevitable happens....snackage ensues! 

First thing noted...portions are HUGE.  Very share friendly piled-high plates, where each feed 2-3 eager loungers.

Nachos Nachos Nachos ($16.95): Chicken, Refried Beans, Mixed Cheeses, Jalapenos, Tomatoes, Onions & Black Olives. Monstrous portions, good flavor, with plenty of cheese to scare away the lactose. You WILL make a mess btw LOL 

20 Buffalo Wings ($17.95): BBQ & Hot. The BBQ sauce is semi-sweet, but the hot left spiciness desired. Cooked well, still juicy on the insides and over-sauced.

You will find better food out there...cheaper drinks...better lounges...

But I feel like Peppermill is a great mix of the three, one for locals and vistors alike."}
{"text":"This place has a great breakfast menu. We go here every time we are in Vegas for breakfast. The bloodymary's are awesome for them hangovers. They let you wait in the lounge area which is also nice with a firepit and flatscreen tv's for the sports fan."}
{"text":"The Peppermill has long been talked about in my group of friends, but it took me a while to visit.  

I'm a fan of bloody Marys, and was told The Peppermill was the place to get one on the strip.  Perhaps the drink was so well crafted I couldn't taste it, but I'm almost positive there was no vodka in my drink.  The ambiance was fun, and the service was friendly.  I'm open to coming back later and trying the 'Mill again."}
{"text":"This place has Fab decor. It has that old vtg vegas feel that just makes you smile. The food is very good and comes in enormous portions, I ordered eggs and had to take half of it home! It is worth the trip and the parking is so easy.
 My only complaint is the seating is not made for us curvy folk, anyone with a big bottom may need to ask for a chair. The tables are screwed into the floor and have minimal movement. They need a few bigger seating areas. Not size friendly but awesome otherwise.
 Skip the lousy buffets and enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Classic Vegas! Healthy portions of food, get you out of the casino for a bit and the atmosphere is unique"}
{"text":"1. Ac is nice and strong in the morning
2. The service was super attentive and fast
3. The vibe here is super cool must come when in Vegas 
4. The food is large portions
5. More expensive than other diners but well worth
6. Will come again when in Vegas"}
{"text":"I was looking for a Vegas place with character and that was frequented by locals. This is the place! I ate here twice. The food, drinks, service, and prices are better than anything you'll find in a Strip hotel."}
{"text":"Considering it's Vegas, I expected this place to be a lot prettier and nice since Reno's is beautiful but it wasn't. 


The food was pretty good though. We shared 16 piece of hot wings and they were pretty yummy! They're huge though! So if you're not so hungry I recommend you just getting the 10. 

We also had a Scorpion on the rocks.. YUMMMM!!!!! I walked out of the happy and buzzed at 12:30pm lmao! It's huge, so if you're driving I would recommend to share with someone!  Also, blended has ice cream(also delicious) ! 



OH AND THE PEANUTS ARE ADDICTING!!"}
{"text":"We always make it by for one meal when we come to Sin City since the late 90's. We love Fireside Lounge while we wait on our table and play video poker sometimes. Plates are huge, split if you are a couple! Breakfast is the real deal, go early or the line is out the door! Saturdays and Sundays are only for the ones with time to waste as the wait can be an hour. Once seated they move it along pretty good. We tell everyone about the place and even take new folks if we can to spread the word."}
{"text":"Better then expected. The place might not look like much, but the food was pretty good especially for the price. I had the chicken fried steak with eggs. My brother had the mushroom burger. Better then dennys, that's for sure"}
{"text":"Well you cant really go wrong at peppermill. All their food is actually pretty on point. I love the sampler appetizer simply bc there chicken quesadilas are really tasty. Only reason they dont get 5 Star is their prices are too High. But hey it is on the las vegas strip so Wat do u expect? Complementary honey roasted peanuts in lounge is a plus. But heres my biggest tip. FRENCH TOAST AMBROSIA. sooooo gooood. Love the purple boisenberry (I think) syrup. Loaded with fruit. Orgasm in my mouth. Probably best french toast dish ive ever had. Layout of this restraunts pretty dope as well. Looks like whoever designed it was on shrooms. Lol. Cool place."}
{"text":"Two cliches apply to the Peppermill: everything you've heard is true, and words can't describe it.

There's no way to fully descibe the decor of the restaurant & lounge. It's kind of a retro-futuristic 50s/80s neon hybrid. The pink is bubblegum hot, the blue is sky electric, the mirrored tiling and faux greenery add to the surreal atmosphere. Recently several huge monitors were added to the entry/waiting area, and a widescreen travelogue of tableaus from around the world plays on them. A new one pops up every few minutes. Times Square, then Tokyo, then whitewater rapids. It's like a postmodern vacation.

The lounge is built around a circular flame pool, but there is also grouped seating available. The bar offers traditional seating. Be warned, the cocktails pictured on the cocktail menu are as large as they look. Pace yourself!

The restaurant is mainly diner-style booths for seating, with counter service available if you'd like to get a look at what's going on in the kitchen. Here even the menu is huge. I can recommend the Old-Fashioned Belgian Waffle, the Western Fruit Plate, the hamburgers, and the Nachos Nachos Nachos. This is also the kind of restaurant where sometimes just dessert is enough: recently a friend ordered a sundae thinking she would get something simple and ended up with a dish almost as big as her head.

The prices look a little spendy, but when measured against portion size, they're a geat value for a Strip experience like this. Go, and be prepared to be tempted to buy a bag of pink & blue sparkly table sugar as a souvenir."}
{"text":"This place is so Vegas!  Once you're inside, it kind of feels like you're eating in a glowy bluish forest.  Some people actually get to eat under the canopies of the fake trees.  All the waitstaff are dressed up in some way.  The cocktail waitresses have these shmexy long gowns, the waitresses have short skirts and suspenders, and the waiters have a male version of the suspenders.  They show less skin, though. Too bad. 

This place is known not only for its Vegas-y vibes, but also for its large portions!  Most of our group struggled to finish their meals, but a long day of competition worked wonders on my appetite. That mushroom burger didn't stand a chance.  And the milkshakes? GINORMOUS. In general, I'd say food quality is mediocre, but they give you such a large quantity that I feel most people would be inclined to take half of it home. (I love leftovers) Also, for those of you who are into the brekky-for-dinner thing, breakfast is served all day long. 

Additional bonus: our server was so nice to separate all the orders onto separate checks despite the fact that we presented her with a 20-person group. Winning!"}
{"text":"We loved the juicy, flavorful pastrami burger with onion rings so much that we went back a second time on our 5 day trip to Vegas.  The only reason I downgraded them a star was because my hubby ordered a Mai Tai and what he got was nothing like a Mai Tai.  We still drank it but we were disappointed.  Other than that, a very solid and fun Vegas dining experience."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Great crab cakes and fish and chips. Great atmosphere. Plus, the lounge was in the movie Casino."}
{"text":"Many years ago, a young boy sat in a diner with his sister and dad, tired after a long run at Circus Circus. Nope, not the midway but instead I was on a heater a the craps table.

Anyhow, I have a vivid memory of gigantic ice cream mountains here. Our group of 16 wanted to know if it was true or merely romanticism of good times past. When the food came out, all we could do was laugh.

Omelets made of dinosaur eggs (probably), ice cream scooped using shovels and a fruit plate that could have been used for a company party. Amazing and just hilarious. The Peppermill omelet, as big as it was, tasted very good. Loved the hash browns too. The banana split was right on - QUALITY ice cream and bananas. 

The kicker was our service. Very funny, helpful and was very communicative about our table. Oh yeah, hung out at the kitchy lounge sipping on bloody marys. TVs with music videos including greats like One Direction. Wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I've waited so many years to finally come here.  I've been hearing about this place since I was a child and just stalled and stalled to come and eat/drink here. 

I finally had some friends and family in town and decided to come here as a group for lunch. 

What a nice old school vibe with great service and great food. 

We really all enjoyed it and I will be making it here more often as I regret not coming here sooner."}
{"text":"Lots of food but bad quality. Pork sausage was not homemade but rather the rubbery microwaveable kind. I asked for walnut pancaked and received walnuts on top of my pancakes. I wanted to order a Mimosa but the bartender waitress never got around to my table, regardless of me asking my table waiter three times! The wait was over and hour and they rush you through your meal. I do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"We came here after our wedding at the Chapel of the Bells with our handful of friends. We had a terrible waitress at first, she was very rude. But my best friend, the awesome dude that he is, went up to the hostess and said \" I suggested this place for my friends who just got married. can we try again on the waitress?\" they did, and the second one was awesome. she was from bulgaria ( it seems that a lot of people that work there are eastern european, which i thought was awesome) We had some champagne, which was good and not overpriced. the food was decent-good, the portions are huge, which was too much for me, and the vibe is very diner-vegas like, which was kind of cool. It got 3 stars for not giving us issues with the waitress change, and the food was alright."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a tradition for me, i always plan to come here at least one late night every time I'm in town. What i love about this place obviously is the 24 hours of service, very \"Vegas\" ambiance (neon everywhere with mirror walls) and very good food and service. Service again is awesome, they even have cocktail waitresses that serve alcohol with your dinner. 

I would recommend hands down the BBQ pork ribs dinner , the meat is so tender it falls off the bones and the rack is so big it hangs off the plate. Get it with a side of onion rings, chicken chowder soup and a coke and you are set! Other notable favorites include the Chicken Fried Steak, Buffalo Chicken Wrap and Lasagna.

The lounge inside the restaurant is also pretty fun especially if you are like me and do not really prefer the loud expensive ass clubs on the strip."}
{"text":"Brief: BIG portions, yummy food.

Ordered pancake breakfast... The pancake was twice the size of my head!
I'd recommend ordering something you have as leftovers because that'll probably be the case."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for something \"brunchy\" on a Sunday morning. I was close by so I decided to drive over here. 

I ordered French toast, an order of sausage links, eggs and a Hawaii Sunset mimosa. 

Sooooooo much food....I ate it all though. The drink was pretty good too. The bill comes to around $30 with the drink and I gave the waitress a $5 for good service.

Would visit again...love old Vegas!"}
{"text":"Awesome service & delicious food. Took my sister & brother in law, they also loved it. Had the steak & eggs for breakfast, steak was perfect, as ordered! Thank you staff!!"}
{"text":"The Conquest! Also, portions are huge. Share. This was a great place to eat. Also serves breakfast all day. Expect a wait. Always busy, but worth it."}
{"text":"This old restaurant is still alive and kicking. You want a big and filling meal for your money's worth, go here! Every time I go to Vegas I stop by here at least once during my trip. This restaurant is open 24 hours and has great food. They also have a lounge in the back which is good size, nice fire pit in the middle of a small water fountain, some pretty hostesses, and decent price drinks. The menu is your typical American food you can find at Dennys, Norms, Spires, etc. But the quality at Peppermill far surpasses those places. I would recommend this place to everyone going to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Can't got wrong with a late night visit to the Peppermill. It can definitely be a \"theater of the living.\" The food is pretty good and comes quickly. The prices are a little high but not crazy considering the restaurant's location. I got a basic egg and bacon breakfast. The bacon was thin and cheap.  Overall you'll be able to find something to eat and have a good time."}
{"text":"As Vegas as it gets. If you've ever seen Box of Lies on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, imagine trying to describe something in one of those boxes. That's how I feel trying to describe this restaurant. You wouldn't believe me if I told you and you really do have to see it and experience it to fully understand.

This is a great place to go for a fishbowl sized drink or a fishbowl sized Sundae. It's also a great place to go if you're trying to complete a Man vs. Food type challenge or if you want to order a single entree that will feed your entire family of 6 with leftovers. There is never a shortage of exceptional people-watching, including both the patrons and the staff. Also, when you sit down take a gander at your sugar dispenser. You're welcome. Mindblown yet? Well guess what else - they sell that unicorn poop AND the dispenser at the front when you're paying. BOOM. Vegas. You're welcome. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Finally got the opportunity to check out this diner & lounge. The portions are large, the food was tasty, and our waitress was great! Damn..the pastel colored sugar on the table is an awesome idea. 
We visited Saturday before midnight. There was no wait to be seated. The restaurant appeared to be well managed.

Walked through the fireside lounge area, neat but we were hungry."}
{"text":"1st visit here, Sunday morning around 11:30a, super packed!  Hostess quoted 45 min for a table, but the bar area was first come first serve seating.  Since I was a party of 1, I was able to grab a seat at the bar within the first 5 min of my arrival.  The bar seating gives you a birds eye view of the kitchen and all the action.  Those waitresses are very talented in how they balance and carry all those hot plates!  Portions here are huge and somewhat intimidating.  I settled on the basic breakfast: 3 eggs scrambled w/cheese, 4 crispy bacon strips, hashbrowns add grilled onion and wheat toast.  The bacon was a little on the skimpy side, but the eggs were nice and fluffy and well cooked.  Overall, a pretty decent dining experience."}
{"text":"Order the scorpion on the rocks or with ice cream. You wont be sorry. Don't forget to go back to the Fireside Lounge for an after breakfast cocktail."}
{"text":"We love this place and eat at least one meal here every time we visit Vegas!  Old Vegas style neon lights and large food portions.  Classic yet unique menu."}
{"text":"My husband has had abdominal surgery and has some swelling. He's not in anyway Huge. He wears a 40\" waist under 275. I say this because if you're pregnant or have a larger belly I'd avoid. Every seat is a booth and very tight. It hurts to have things rub against abdomen so we had to leave. There is no accommodating larger people or wheelchairs that I can see. I asked. Before you blast him for being fat please note. He has brain cancer and steroids and medications caused weight gain and bloating."}
{"text":"It's like a Denny's gone wild.  Service was good.  Food is what you expect for diner food.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again but if I was near and had to choose between Denny's and the pepper mill I would come here."}
{"text":"A legendary spot in Vegas!! Was brought here by a local years ago after a night of drinks and dancing and loved the crazy ambiance and delicious food. It instantly became or late night go-to every time we would come to Vegas. The menu is huge! I always get an omelette or scramble with their delicious hash browns. I went back last year and decided to try it again during normal breakfast hours and well sober to see if it was really that good and it was. The only downfall is the wait. Expect at least 30 minutes! But go into the fire lounge to hang and it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Trashy.
Peppermill is a gloriously trashy, blinged out, cornea scarring/neon-ed out, portions so large you have to be rolled out version of Denny's. 

We ordered the Nachos Nachos Nachos to share. We hardly put a dent in that sucker. It was SO HUGE. If I was standing I would have fallen over seeing the size of the fruit-plate (more like platter) that our neighbors got. I think everything on the menu here is required to be larger than  your head.  Food is good diner fare, and for the ridiculous portion size the price is more than a killer deal.

Extra yays for free photo souvenirs and a giant jar of SPRINKLES on the table to add to whatever monstrous sized order of food you get."}
{"text":"Why is a decent salad so hard to find in Las Vegas? Perhaps salad is to Vegas as kryptonite is to Superman; I can not tell you how many nights I am driving around thinking: \"Man, I would love a good salad.\" (This is not an invitation for salad jokes. I am serious.)

Following some research, my first trip to the Peppermill was actually in search of a good salad, but every subsequent trip has been for the rather special ambiance. The salads are impressive: huge, fresh, and creative for a diner-type joint. Plus, in my experience, they grill up the most perfect chicken breast. Still, even if the salads were iceberg blah, I would have to make the occasional Peppermill journey to savor the fabulous interior complete with artificial cherry tree grove. Yes, it is best described as a grove. From the booths to the blossoms, you definitely feel as if you are experiencing something best described as Vintage Vegas as the place opened in 1972. The friendly servers in their equally vintage uniforms complete the experience nicely.

In addition to salads, the Peppermill does dessert and dessert-inspired cocktails well. They have an oatmeal cookie drink that tastes 100% like an oatmeal cookie. Even if you are not hungry, who can pass up that concoction? Even better, you can sip on your cookie in The Fireside Lounge located in the back of the restaurant. It features, and I quote, a \"romantic flaming pool\", and hot pink is the design scheme. Might as well call it \"heaven\".

Insiders tell me that around 5am is when the best people watching occurs, but if you can't find an excuse to go at 5am, you should still find an excuse to go sometime."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I loved the multi-colored sugar on the table, the kitschy decor, and even the huge portions, which are typical for diner establishments, but the food just wasn't that good even under the influence of alcohol.

The Peppermill is considered to be a LV institution with extremely kitschy decor (think of fake trees, neon lights and vinyl wrap-around booths). It's right across the street from Circus Circus, giving it somewhat of a creepy vibe at night. This area of the strip just feels dead now. 

My review is based mainly on the food, which was surprisingly lackluster. I expected it to be at least better then IHOP, but it reminded me of Denny's. I ordered a cheeseburger that was pretty greasy and my friend's salad was made out of iceberg lettuce with huge piles of fruit that looked unappetizing. My sweet potato fries were okay, but tasted like they were previously frozen.

I would have given it a higher rating, but I expect diners to have good \"junk food.\" I think The Peppermill may be better for breakfast, and it's definitely worth a stop if you are interested in Vintage Las Vegas. Also noteworthy is procuring a bag of multi-colored sugar (yes, they do sell it at the register)!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place through a friend that this was the place to go for breakfast, other then the fact that this is the place to go for an incredible atmosphere.

The waitress did get a little bothered that chose a booth and vented to the hostess a little. I just chalked it up to \"Vegas Kitch\" then I sat myself at the counter after I mentioned my little dilemma.

The bar is full of personality from both the patrons and waitresses... very friendly. the menu is extensive and the food is delicious. Definitely looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Pretty goo, and quick stop for some late night fun"}
{"text":"The portion are as everyone says gigantic but the main thing is that the food is delicious. I have been there at very different time of the day and I have never been disappointed. Furthermore, the price is really good and the staff very nice. A special mention for the decorations which give the place a very special atmosphere"}
{"text":"love it.  go into the bar and says hi to Jamie.  koolest bar ever."}
{"text":"Can't believe that ive skipped thisplace so many ti es. Ive been coming to vegas every year since 92 and from the strip it didnt seem worth the stop.  Should have fead the revies. Found it by doing a google search of must see and best of.  Be careful what you order. HUGE HUGE food.  Delicious and top quality. I got a fantastic buger with incredible rings. The environment was fantastic too.  A must see.

The bar area has spectacular ambiance. GOT TO SEE!"}
{"text":"Beau and I did a limo tour our first day in Vegas. It was Friday night and we were sipping on champagne and by 'sipping' i mean we were drinking it straight out of the bottle. Joseph, our driver, took us all over the strip and then down town. We were having such a great time getting to know our surroundings and chatting it up with our driver. He asked us if we wanted to see something really cool. We said \"Yes\". He pulled up in the back of a small parking lot by a dumpster and -I promise- for a split second I was worried he was some crazy dude that was going to harvest and sell our organs on the black market -delivering us in this poorly lit parking lot in the back of an old building that says PEPPERMILL in colorful neon lights to the corrupt doctors and bad guys and less than sterile extraction devices... But like any horror film, against our better judgement, we follow the leader through the back door of the puppymill PEPPERMILL...  we walk in through the back, enter this room filled with fake trees, bright pink couches and pillows and a smoking atmosphere... no, literally... you can smoke in here. There's a beautiful fire pit lounge with blue flames. The waitresses there are dressed in long black gowns and smiling faces. The cocktails are priced well-- the company was established 72 years ago... totally cool feel. It's like you're in an old movie with mobsters relaxing and sipping on gin... except most people are tourists in there. Beau and i didn't order any food, though I've heard it's perfect for late night snacks. Our drinks were great but the atmosphere was awesome. So perfect for the feel of the restaurant. You never would have guessed that the interior would have contrasted to greatly from the exterior. Super cool place. And then we thanked our driver that we got out alive... ;-)"}
{"text":"What is not to love about The Peppermill. Old school Vegas deco, massive portions and open 24/7. With all of the great places to eat in this town I eat there , at least, 3 times per visit. The food is great and you get plenty of it. The country fried steak is the best I have ever had and is almost too big to finish. Beverages are served by attractive women in long black gowns and one of our servers was good looking enough that I wanted to order a case one beer at a time. The lounge portion is ultra cool and definatly designed for couples with a fire fountian in the middle of a booth....yes it was in the movie Casino! I usually stay at The Riv which makes it staggering...uhhh walking distance on those late night early mornings.If you have never been try it because you can't say you have been to Vegas without hitting The Peppermill."}
{"text":"The pepper mill is a Las Vegas staple!  Went on an early Sunday afternoon and expected there to be a wait.  Went and had mimosas inside their fireside bar while we waited 30 min for a table.  This place is always busy but totally vegas from the decor to the staff.  The portions are huge and the one lets are all fluffy and cooked to perfection.  They were out of egg whites unfortunately but the breakfast was pretty much can't miss.  Have never had a terrible experience, and would recommend to anyone that is coming to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Our Uber driver suggested this place and we are so happy we came! The decor and food is amazing, huge portions and great prices. Highly recommend the eggs benedict!!!"}
{"text":"Food is full of value but the frustratingly long waits on a weekend are to be avoided. 

 From the moment we arrived on this particular Saturday morning, we were told it would take 45 minutes...after the 45 elapsed, I checked with the desk and was told at least another 20...we left.  Don't like being lied to and coerced into staying, number 1 and number 2, no food I'd worth an hour wait.  

I do NOT recommend comming here the morning through early pm on a weekend period.

On a lighter note.  We've been here when the wait wasn't as long and were satisfied with meal portions and quality.  It's a great place to have an old Vegas experience at."}
{"text":"How the hell do most places in Vegas get away with ending breakfast at 10:30 in the AM? Do they know they're in Vegas?!?! Blasphemy.

but....since most places end breakfast early....my friends and I ended up at Peppermill's....and I loved it. Breakfast all day and the joint is totally kitsch'd. I was in love.

The food is much better than a Denny's. I had an omelette with spinach, tomato, and feta cheese, which was too big, but delish. Jam tasted homemade and I got fresh fruit on the side instead of hash browns. Loved it.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll hit this place up on the late night to see the show....."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast before my conference started. The portions are really big so plan of sharing with others at least for breakfast. I can't say this is a place as a must stop here kind of feel,  but its somewhere to go for 24hours of food availability."}
{"text":"This place is a Vegas institution.  It has a really cool retro diner atmosphere. Good service and good diner type food. The portions are huge so be prepared to share. The huge desserts are simple but heavenly. It also has a lounge side with a fireplace and some decent drinks."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the fact the portions are plenty big enough to share. Other than that, it's pretty typical. I wouldnt sit at the counter or near it though. It's pretty hot so we asked to move. We were accomodated pretty quickly though."}
{"text":"The wait time was extremely long. When our group finally got a table we waited another 20 minutes before a server even came and took our drink orders. The manager ended up coming and helping with taking our order which made everything worse because she was terrible and rude, the most unprofessional person working there, couldn't explain anything on the menu. 
Most plates were sent back for being cold and undercooked.
Our bill came with extra charges, was a hassle trying to adjust it because the manager, Peggy, was just outrageously rude. I wouldn't recommend going here."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. Very retro. We ate here a few times during our stay. They food was good and we love how they are open 24 hours....Vegas never sleeps!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and come here every time we're in Vegas.

If you come during happy hour they have lots of apps for a reduced price.  We got the chicken wings and they were delicious.  For entree I got the conquest sando with onion rings.  The place was piled high with meat the overflowing with onion rings.  Portions are huge!

Drinks are strong and customer service is outstanding.  The decor is tacky but thats what I love about this place.

Easy parking and great for after the club or late night dining."}
{"text":"This place feels like a Denny's on crack but with better food. There are bright neon lights, lots of colorful things and the decor is like no other. The staff is super friendly. The food was pretty good and the servings were large. Now the drinks, those were amazing! We tried the Scorpion which is 64oz of awesomeness. We also decided to try the Blue Hawaiian. It was so yummy! I can't wait to come back and try their breakfast."}
{"text":"I have found memories of the Fire Pit in the Marin Peppermill. Planning to take a trip to visit the famed Las Vegas mothership soon!

Details to follow."}
{"text":"Great food. Crowded, but they handle it very well. Give good estimates on wait. 
They told us 25 minutes and it was around 22.
Only 4 stars because the food is good but a little over priced.
There $22 dollar steak is not really worth it. Close but not quiet."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was awesome in the Fireside lounge.. completely cheese-ball, old Vegas, fun. I found the drinks to be pricey (even for Vegas) and not tasty at all. We tried 3 and were completely unimpressed by all of them. I know you're paying for atmosphere and whatever, but it's a diner in a crappy location in the bad part of the strip.. come on."}
{"text":"-Poor service
-Food was dry from long time under heat lamp
-Price was very high ($25/person) for quality and portion size
-Cool & interesting atmosphere and good people watching. Maybe through attrition they get better staff and kitchen?"}
{"text":"As always , great service , great food , large portions , Andrew had the Frank Sinatra sandwich, he loved it , I had The Peppermill Burger med rare, and it actually came out med rare.
Our server was Alma, she was right on , filling water glasses and checking to see if we needed anything.

Definitely a need to go place for all out of towners .
Update  7- 18-2017 here with Andrews cousin and Lauren and her husband Christophe , they are visiting from France, had to show them one of the iconic land marks of Las Vegas, Lauren ordered a banana split, it was huge and a wonderful mix of flavor."}
{"text":"We ended up at this restaurant because someone on my daughters cheer team had planned a team dinner. This place is kind of famous as it has been shown in several movies and that is about the only thing good I can say about it. Looking at the menu they have a $28.00 dollar porterhouse steak. At 28.00 dollars I figured that it would be of reasonable quality even though we where at what appeared to be a fancy coffee shop, so I ordered the steak and was very disappointed with the quality. It was an 1/8 of an inch thick! Heck, I have had better breakfast steaks and Denny's! The sautéed mushrooms tasted terrible. Basically they were canned mushrooms thrown in oil and warmed up. No flavor what so ever. The baked potato was even bad. It was over cooked and damp tasting like it had been sitting in a steam oven all day. This restaurant managed to strike out on all 3 items that I ordered. Even the drink that I ordered was flat and had no carbonation. I would stay away from this place if you like flavor."}
{"text":"This place is good!! A little expensive but not too bad considering it's in Vegas. Not a ton of options for a vegetarian, however, the fruit plate was absolutely amazing. Definitely try it!!"}
{"text":"Old school Vegas set up that would be much better suited in the Fremont area.  Loners and bums hanging out on this end of the Strip.

Pleasant dining and experience and pretty good food.  Better for a late night than an early morning.  I would go back, but I don't know with who..."}
{"text":"As a restaurant this is a three star place, but considering the history of the Peppermill, the unique old Vegas ambiance, and because this really is a diner, I went with 4 stars. For a diner, the food is pretty good. Just remember, this is not the Bellagio. This is about the nicest diner food I think I have had. Portions were huge, prices were reasonable, and there is quite a wide variety of foods to try. Chicken was kind of tough, but that is somewhat expected of a diner.

I think a visit is in order simply to support a piece of vegas history. However, after you visit you might not be surprised why Vegas has redecorated since the Peppermill first opened."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is amazing, I love the indoor trees and fireside lounge. This place has a large menu and the portions are generous. I ordered the tangy chicken wrap and my friend ordered the eggs beni. eggs beni was eggsellent! The tangy chicken wrap was a let down, I did not like the sauce for the chicken but I think this place overall has good food. I want to come back and order other items. We also ordered champagne drink which I do not recall the name that was delicious. Champagne with muddled strawberries. Service was fast and nice but ask for a cocktail waitress because our waitress didn't know much about the drink menu"}
{"text":"This place was everything old school about Vegas diner eating !! And open 24 hours big portions too so if your hunger and want real food with a cool atmosphere this is the place to try ! We ordered fish & chips crispy just the way I like it. Also had the chicken fried steak huge portion tii gravy was everything...."}
{"text":"First, let me get something straight. A couple of the people on here gave bad reviews and then stated they had something like \"teriyaki chicken\" -- THIS PLACE IS A DINER!

You don't come here for the teriyaki chicken or steak, you come here for the classic diner favorites: anything breakfast, sandwiches and burgers. It is in these areas that the Peppermill will knock your socks off. 

The portions are huge and although the place is super packed 24/7, the quality of food is still very good. My eggs (over easy), were cooked perfectly, my chicken fried steak was crispy, warm and had just the right amount of gravy, and my hash browns were golden brown and delicious. 

After a night of drinking, this place provides the diner fuel needed to return to the strip."}
{"text":"Good service and breakfast. Heard the omelettes are huge so wife and I split a dish and difinetely filled both of us up!"}
{"text":"Though an older restaurant located on the northern part of the strip across by Circus Circus, they serve among the largest and tastiest portions of food for a reasonable price.  We had the Cobb salad, Ruben sandwich, and sampler... which left us more than full. The neon lights and booth setting makes for a visually pleasing atmosphere while you enjoy your breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Only draw back is that they only have 2 areas if you have a large party of 7 or more.   Would recommend you make reservations in that case.  And BTW, breakfast is served 24/7!"}
{"text":"Ordered a medium rare BBQ bacon burger with guac on the side. They forgot the guac, but I didn't need it by the time I saw how huge and juicy the burger already was. My friends got omelettes, scrambles, and other burgers. Come HUNGRY because the portions are HUGE. you will leave with leftovers. Quick service is always a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Wow! I knew this was a popular place when I saw the parking lot and the people waiting inside. There is a counter, so we didn't have to wait too long, as a couple of spots opened up quickly. The food is abundant, I think my omelet had at least 8 eggs. I might be exaggerating, but it was huge. The hash browns were crispy and flavorful. I saw some orders of pancakes go by and they were the size of a dinner plate. My friend had a BLT and there was a lot of bacon. The servers are attentive and friendly. If you're in Vegas, stop by for breakfast or lunch. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant / Lounge on the Las Vegas Strip there Lounge really has great drinks at affordable prices the restaurant side can be very crowded and the week can be quite long however the food aims to please and it's tasty. However the lounge does provide a sense of relaxation Romance and it contains intimate sections for you and your significant other or party to have their own room without being invaded by other guests. If you're in Las Vegas I say you should check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is a Las Vegas landmark. The last time I was here was about 20+ years ago. 

Went here last week for a friend's birthday. It's has that nostalgic old Vegas feel. The ambiance is very noisy, colorful, neon & Art Deco. 

Service was poor. We had to ask for a cocktail waitress 4 times about 25 minutes after seating before we got to order drinks. They have a system where a waitress from the lounge area serves alcoholic beverages. The regular restaurant server does not. Prices were very reasonable. We ordered a bottle of wine from the small list that they had. Also tried a specialty cocktail. It was too sweet and tasted very artificial. 

The food portion was pretty big. Porterhouse didn't look very appetizing. The ribeye was good. Crab cakes were decent. Overall food was mediocre at best. 

After dinner we went over to the lounge side where the fire pit is. Fire pit was crowded so we sat at a large booth nearby and order drinks. We ordered Old Fashions, Moscow Mule & Mandrin Vodka/Soda. The drinks were weak and watered down. 

Overall we enjoyed ourselves cause we had great company with us. I probably won't be back here anytime soon. Possibly in 20+ years."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is like if Sean Connery as James Bond designed a Denny's.  It's great diner food with awesome cocktails, cheap!  The fire-pit lounge is just the best thing for wowing your friends who come in from ther parts of the country, or for getting out of the LV January cold.  The whole place is lit in purple, with all kinds of amazing floral decor. 

The mood is a must-stop-by and is an easy walk from the Wynn or Riviera."}
{"text":"My first stop that my sister-in-law took me to (she lives in Vegas) once I got off the plane! I think I would make this my first stop again when and if I visit. Walked right in, sat right down, and ordered right away! Huge drinks at a nice price. Very nostalgic place with all the bright lights, but dimly lit bar area with sunken seats and tons of huge fake plants! Made me feel like this must have been what Vegas was like in the 60's and 70's!"}
{"text":"As a local, it saddens me to write this review.  I have been to this place on many of late night occasions and it it always busy. But on this night, the service was so horrible, we almost got up and left!  And it was only about 10pm, early for this 24/7 place. We got seated, and then watched two other tables get seated after us and orders taken, before the same server came over to us.  She apologized and said she didn't see us there.  Then we ordered three different sandwiches, nothing fancy.  She brought each sandwich out separately, and spaced enough that one person finished their food before the third person ever got theirs. We insisted that the first person eat their sandwich otherwise it would get cold. My fries were ice cold.  I had to finally flag down any server to complain.  It took too long for our server to come back over and ask what was up.  She then explained that they were busy and I should be patient.  Not what you say to hungry customers. I'm not sure I would waste my time going back here as there are sooooo many other choices in this time.  I'm sad to say The Peppermill with not be my \"go to\" place again."}
{"text":"My breakfast was delicious! Very generous portions of great tasting good. And where else do they have cocktail servers in sparkly gowns at 9:30am? I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped by  here for a late night dinner. The portions are HUGE and I do mean huge, one plate could probably feed me for 2 days. I ordered the skewer, beef was a little dry but not bad. The Mai Thai I ordered was also in a big glass but tasty and they also serve breakfast all day long which was a plus."}
{"text":"We came here the last time I was in Vegas and I just don't see what all the hype is about. Yeah the portions are gigantic but the food is just so-so and I would rather have excellent food in a smaller portion over a mountain of food that is just really bland, I guess. We took an uber all the way from MGM because we had heard how legendary it was. I would definitely never go out of my way to eat here again, especially with the literally hundreds of other choices! 

The 80s neon \"vibe\" is a kick though- super fun!"}
{"text":"Great portions for the price and totally shareable . Omelettes are awesome ! Good sIzed cups for coffee. Must try!"}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Coffee
Ambrosia French Toast, No melon, with whip
Carrot Cake

Rarely one to stay out late and certainly not the sort to do so while drinking heavily only to find myself craving greasy food at 3:00am I'd be lying if I suggested the iconic Peppermill had ever interested me as more than a sort of Las Vegas curiosity and yet with a 12-mile run and a few donuts from Ronald's already under my belt it was with a 'what the hell' smile that I entered the neon-lit space with mirrored ceilings just as the cops arrived to deal with an unruly inebriated couple who were refusing to pay their tab.  Featured in everything from CSI to Showgirls and featuring a 24/7 menu of everything from breakfasts and burgers onward to acclaimed nachos and desserts plus a setting quite unlike any other with drunken creatures of the night in all sorts of disarray it was clear on entering the space that it was I who was the novelty and requesting a table for one while using proper manners I was seated quickly, greeted immediately thereafter, and provided with superlative service throughout my 55 minute and 5 cup of coffee (plus one for the road) stay.  Certainly not 'gourmet' or 'artisan' but wholly satisfying for both 'dinner' and 'show' my order would consist of only two items and electing for the carrot cake as an appetizer while my main course was prepared I was happy to find a modest slice of high quality placed before me, the dense body not overly sweetened but instead nutty and aromatic with a thin layer of cream cheese icing adding a tangy sweetness without overwhelming - a balance I neither expected nor received with the decadent pile of custard-laden egg bread that followed complete with fresh fruits, whipped cream, and warm syrup...exactly the sort of thing I imagine I'd crave after a night of drinking...or after an early morning run...or when I was 8 years old...or 25 years later."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with a funky, kitschy slightly 80's, slightly tropical vibe. 

We didn't have a wait, but we came late at night. 

The food here is good and comes to you in large portions. Everyone ate something different--a salad, a burger, a sandwich and we all enjoyed our meals. The food here is on the pricier side due to portion size--I was tempted to get a fruit salad plate, but it was in the $15-17 dollar range and that just seemed outrageous to me. 

It wasn't the finest of dining, but it was good food and the service was decent.

My Blue Hawaiian tasted like Kool Aid and the cocktail waitress even warned me that it wasn't going to be a strong drink. WTF. This wasn't a necessarily cheap cocktail for a coffee shop type of place, I expected a bit more than what I got. I didn't finish it. 

I didn't have one, but the desserts looked great."}
{"text":"This place is a must for tourist and locals alike!  The Fireside Lounge is ideal for playing kissy face on a date night.  If you are bringing the family, then eat in the main dining room.

Great late night dining!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and staff were great. My wife and I went here for breakfast on a recommendation from staff at Aria. We're glad we went. My food was ok. My wife's crab cake benedict was pretty good. But the hash browns on both were lackluster. However I would definitely go back and I recommend anyone to go. Especially for breakfast. The lounge in the back was absolutely awesome. Total throwback to the 70's. Loved it. If you're not hungry, go there for the lounge!"}
{"text":"This place is SUUUPER cheesy looking.  

From the outside, it looks as if this place has closed down.  Then you walk in and it is dimly lit, purple carpeting and neon lights scattered throughout.  

The A/C is blowing as cold as possible, their are tourists and alcoholics everywhere, the waitresses are VERY scantily clad and you at first feel like you walked into a strip club by accident. 

The hot wings are decent at best, Munch's breakfast which is similar to a breakfast hash was not bad but not that good and I also ordered Joe's San Francisco special, which was definitely the best dish I had their.  Even this dish was maybe a 2 star at best, the only positive of this place is having fun watching the waitresses picking things up off the floor.  

It was a good hangover pick me up, but then I got back to my hotel with a severe case of CHORRO!!!!....!!!

Keep this in mind when considering coming here"}
{"text":"Over priced and over rated for my taste.  It's been around forever and maybe for late late night but I never saw the attraction of this place it always seems kinda of seedy to me."}
{"text":"I love this place - the breakfast is incredible. It's always my last stop before leaving Vegas.
Don't be afraid because waiting time."}
{"text":"Went here every day for breakfast. The omelette has 8-10 eggs in it! The hash browns are the best I've ever had in my life. Drinks are served in pint glasses (large). Service is brilliant."}
{"text":"Cool looking spot inside.  Food is good. Price is right! The French Toast was delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favorite's. The place is very nice and everything in the menu is available 24h. The food is great and the price is reasonable. Restaurant side and lounge side are unique. The perfect place for a casual meeting with a girl. The only thing is stopping me to give five stars is the restroom sucks."}
{"text":"My new area of intimacy in Vegas--I can't wait to go back. The Fireside Lounge's staff is delightful, and my husband loved the sophisticated black dresses worn by the cocktail servers (oh, googly bear, you need a dress like that). The food was okay, but the drinks were outstanding. Oh, the scorpion bowl. I want to bathe in the scorpion bowl. The other foo foo drinks are good, but they can't top the giant scorpion bowl with ice cream. The flaming lounge fountain is great, too, but after a few hours I had a raging sunburn. However, I recovered quite nicely."}
{"text":"Good food and good service! Located near Circus Circus. Good cocktails and prices were reasonable. Good family restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas with some friends and someone wanted to check out the Fireside. We were all a little buzzed when we arrived, so my memory may be a bit hazy but it definitely seemed like a cool place. Feels very much like a throwback to a 70s lounge - but in a way like this place has been around since the 70s... not a corporate 70s themed bar.

They had good drinks and comfortable couches. They have pretty waitresses who aren't slutting it up like many of the casino girls. I can't imagine starting your night here, or going during the day - this place seems tailor made for winding up here after a late night of drinking and partying, for a couple of wind-down nightcaps."}
{"text":"So glad I yelped this place. It's definitely gonna be a go-to whenever I hit up Vegas. Open 24/7, reasonable prices, HUGE portions--I can only imagine what this place is like at 3am on a Saturday. Standard American diner fare--if you're anything like me, that's a pretty common craving to have. Each pancake probably weighs a solid pound, their omelets are made with TEN eggs, and their hash browns are beautifully crispy and will not leave you wanting anything more. I wouldn't recommend the waffles unless you've really got a craving (you do you), only because they're pretty ordinary in size and taste and don't even come with sides. Their lemon-cranberry muffin is sweet enough to be a dessert on its own! 

This place is garish and gaudy and they know it! Flamingo lamp fixtures, neon lights, fake cherry trees, and velvet lined booths. Honestly this place is as fun as it gets! 

Come as you are. It's Vegas! No one will judge."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast!   We got there around 9:00am and it was busy but they sat us immediarely.  I had the veggie omlette with home fries, delicious and huge.   If you're into Bloody Mary's, try theirs.   Its only $9, it's made fresh and it was really good."}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be the Peppermill experience I remember from growing up in the Bay Area. Sadly, it fell short...by a long shot.   Really bad service.  Asked waitress for cocktail service 4 times -- noone ever came.  Food order took more than 45 minutes to  be processed.  I should add that the place wasn't filled to capacity.  People all around us came later than we did and got served before us.  Ordered an omelette for dinner.   Huge, but very average. And did I mention cold?   Going to the front to pay the bill at the end was even worse.  2 people in line in front of us and it took 15 mins to get them taken care of.  When the hostess finally got to us and asked casualy, \"how were things tonight?\" I said back to her, \"honestly, pretty bad....\""}
{"text":"I took a friend there today for lunch I live a mile from the place and been here usually at night in the lounge. They were very busy I got seated quickly. since I am a retired corporate executive chef and pastry chef for 45 years I notice everything the dining room was very clean the Waitress were spotless with crisp clean uniforms and very friendly I had the club sandwich finally got exactly what it supposed to be on fresh marble rye with perfect hot fries that didnt sit under a heat lamp, my friend had the buffalo chicken wrap and that was very fresh and delicious! Believe me I would know. They seem to have the classics on the 24 hour menu and do them exactly like they supposed to. Again believe me I would know. Oh I'll be a regular for sure!  Well ok I'm back for breakfast with out of town friends, and was not disappointed at all this place is great,not only because it's old school Vegas local hangout since forever. They got it right again big league. I know I won't be embarrassed when o take visitors here and keep going back for the staff and food. Whoever the GM of this restaurant is had really got it together. Again trust me I know. I'm back for lunch today what a great burger!"}
{"text":"...who knew it was so easy to be transported to 1974....on many levels it is a WTF experience...another not to be missed Vegas experience...hang out at the romantic Fireside Lounge...nothing else really matters..."}
{"text":"Last day of a Superbowl trip and we all needed a good meal.  After going back and forth on places to eat we anger l ended up at the Peppermill.  I come to Vegas quite a bit and have pretty much tried every place but had not tried this spot.  My cousin who was with us was insisting on it so in we go.  Vintage Vegas, loved the old school vegas vibe mixed in with classic diner.  The staff very nice and we got seated quickly.  Food was great and portions were huge.  Try the Cali burger with onion rings... Wow.  I highly recommend and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My go to place 24/7 in Las Vegas, whether its breakfast or late night, love to go for the unique funky retro Vegas Diner vibe . Walk around into the different rooms to see for yourself. How do they keep the mirror ceilings & the trees so clean & free of smudge & dust ? The food here is always large & good. For a unique Historic Vegas Experiance give them a try."}
{"text":"I liked this spot. Went for a early supper on a Sunday after an afternoon of walking. The service was excellent. The food was nice and hot when we got it. It tasted good but serving sizes were just too big. I got eggs benny but I only needed two eggs. I got 3 and a serving of cottage cheese so big that when I ate my fill it looked like I had not touched it.

We got there during happy hour. Drink service was quick but my mojito was way too sweet so I did not finish it. My hubby loved his wine and sampler tray. His leftovers made great midnight snacks"}
{"text":"Ok, this is like taking a step back in time... like 1975!! The decor is waaaay outdated (but I think that's the appeal?) Apparently this place is famous (movies filmed here? celebrities eat here??) It's huge and tacky and the waitresses are old and the portions are BIG! Was it the best food I've ever had... no. Was it bad...no. Would I come back here... absolutely one night when I'm drunk and it's 2am!! It beats Denny's , that's for sure!
ps. The Fireside lounge is attached to the restaurant and is only open in the evening. I poked my head in to check it out... very dark, firepits, neon lights...looks like a groovy time!"}
{"text":"I always come to this place when I'm in Vegas. Mostly for breakfast...their omelets are ridiculously huge and delicious. A must-have is the bagel with cream cheese and jam. The service is good...thumbs up to my waitress Destiny, great service."}
{"text":"My kids are in town so I took them here it's probably one of my favorite places to hang out with friends and eat, the food prices are fairly decent not to much but not cheap the portions are huge so if you are not one to eat that much you might want to share a entree, everything I've tried was really good! They also have happy hour which is when I'm normally there sense I work nights."}
{"text":"This place is great for ppl who are hungry and hungry in midnight. The space is great and food is great with large portion. The service is recommended."}
{"text":"The best Bloody Cesar drinks! Nice bartender! The philly cheese steak was GIGANTIC! I ate half sandwich and 2 onion rings. The onion rings are also HUGE! Was so cheap and so worth it! Will go again! My husbands burger was huge too and he loved it!"}
{"text":"Peppermill ended up being the place that most surprised me in Vegas, I wasn't really sure what to expect but now I recommend this place to anyone I talk to who is planning a trip to Vegas. 

We came during the afternoon brunch so my I don't have anything to say about the Fireside Lounge [except that I really want to try it out next time]. 

We came at a pretty random time, like 2 pm or something on a weekday and were quickly sat. The best way I can describe the interior is that it is like an old fashioned diner with a modern twist, it is colored blue, pink and purple! One thing I noticed is that it seemed well maintained and clean, unlike many old school diners and other places on the strip. 

Service was prompt and friendly, checked on us the right amount of times while also letting us pig out in peace. 

There were many many things I wanted to try on the menu but I opted for an omelet, it hit the spot and was a TON of tasty food. I definitely recommend this place for food after you have been walking the strip all day and have worked up an appetite. The price was more than reasonable for the amount of food you get and we all left stuffed and happy. We also left with a complimentary souvenir photo of our group - fun touch! 

It is a fairly simple looking place from the outside during the day which could make it easy to miss, it is up on the northern part of the strip sorta near Circus Circus. 

If you are looking for an affordable place to stuff your face in Vegas - definitely try the Peppermill!"}
{"text":"There are many ways to do Vegas. One of the classic experiences is the all-nighter. It can be tough to pull off but with the right group of people, endurance and pacing the best all-nighters end at the Peppermill. There you can get that last drink at the lounge in a neon faux jungle setting, lounging next to a firepit/fountain. Get one one the giant girly drinks like the scorpion, or grab a bloody mary or irish coffee. The pours are good and drinks really round out the night.

Then walk to the attached diner to get a greasy spoon breakfast to ward off that hangover. After it's all said and done it's on to an iconic Vegas moment, a blinking, eye shielding stumble into the morning light to a waiting cab. Rest, recover and go again."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in Vegas for a friends birthday it was our last day in Vegas and the birthday girl HAD to eat at the infamous peppermill. I ordered the chicken parmigiana it was so bland,not good at all I couldnt even finish it after the first bite and really expensive 23 bucks. Luckily my friend ordered something off the menu (grilled cheese sandwich)she was nice enough to share, it was soooooo good the pancakes are good too, this is the only reason for the 3 stars. Stick to the basics. I would not came back again."}
{"text":"The fireside lounge is the best part about this place (aside from the Mrs. Palin lookalike serving us in the restaurant side who refused to take a photo with my group)....  You enter the super dark lounge through glass doors and there is a walk down roundabout with a pool (cool water which I tested) and a mini volcano erupting in the center, televisions all around everywhere but then again the ceilings are covered in disco ball mirror tiles and the walls alllll mirrors so maybe there was only one tv but the reflection in the mirrorS made me see otherwise...  anyway it was very calming after a rough night with the bright pink, blue and tiny lil white lights.  I honestly could have taken a nap here and nobody would have seen me.  There are all these small rooms tucked away amidst the mirrors, red carpet and red couches.  $8.00 Bloody marys which are served in a large cocktail glass along with a HUGE piece of celery, tomato and a slice of cucumber are a meal in themselves make it a double for and extra $2.00.  

Its a good time, make sure to stop by next time youre dragging on a morning in Vegas."}
{"text":"First timer at the Peppermill!

I knew we were in for a real treat whenever we told the cabbie the we wanted to go to the Peppermill Lounge. His response was a long pause and then he turned around and asked \"How'd you guys hear about the Peppermill?\"

It's a place that locals and people in the know love and they want to keep it away from the mainstream Las Vegas Crowd.

Pink and blue neon lights, disco ball ceiling and of course the fireplace. It's a place that you would never find in Boston, where I was visiting from. Maybe that's the reason why I loved it, it seemed like a million miles away from anywhere else that I had been.

We sat lounge side and ordered drinks and appetizers. The food was decent, my only complaint was the drinks that we had packed very little punch which was ok, being that it was probably 2:00 PM when we went there. It was still a great place to relax before a big night on the town.

I suggest going there with date. Don't tell her where you are going, just tell her you know a place uptown."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Holly Madison....so yes, I'll admit it. I wanted to go here in hopes of seeing her and her gaggle of Vegas friends. It seems like on every episode of Holly's World they're hanging at The Peppermill. Unfortunately, she wasn't there when we went. BUT I'm sooooo glad we checked this train-wreck of a restaurant out. It's Denny's on crack. 

After going here, I can honestly say I know what being like Lindsey Lohan must feel like. Let me help you imagine this place a little better. Take your average Denny's or IHop, sprinkle in some meth and blow, add some 60 year old ex-strippers, angry foreign tourists, mirrored ceilings, neon lights and a haze from extra-smoky cigarette smoke.

The food is GIANT....you'll feel like you're on an episode of Pee-Wee's Playhouse when you get your food. The waitresses look like they hate their life and could give a flying F that you think your ice cream sundae is amazing! (Cheer up ladies....you work in a crazy place!)

If you want an amazing experience and crazy pictures to go along with it....go here. It's my new favorite place in Vegas. The kitsch level is off the charts!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a new favorite place of mine for breakfast. 

On a Tuesday mid-morning (about 9 on 6/5/18) the free parking lot was plentiful. We were seated at an awesome round booth right away.

My biscuits and gravy plate ($8.95) was huge. Actually all of the portions were huge. The coffee ($3.95 with waitstaff constantly asking to refill) was really good.

Great staff. Crystal was a wonderful waitress. The ladies wear awesome outfits. Cool colors and interesting decor. Casual restaurant for everyone. Our toddlers loved it too.

Some day I might get up the nerve to try a 64-ounce \"Scorpion.\" Just ask the lovely bartender (since apparently it's offensive to call them barmaids now?) what the ingredients are.

My only disappointment came when I learned that the blueberry muffins and other delicious items at our table weren't made in-house.

{"text":"The drink I had (Blue Hawaiian) was really good. I asked for it to not be on the sweet side, and they delivered. The ambiance is a bit eclectic for my taste and seems like it should be a strip club. Either way, it has a nice, old school charm to it. Next time, I'll try the food!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. What's really unique and special about this place is that it's like stepping into the 80s. Everything is really cool and classic.

Gigantic and tasty portions of food. My favorite is the pancakes. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast . I ordered the Mediterranean omelette with English muffin and my sister got the egg Benedict. Both of our orders were huge. I didn't expect that. It was very delicious and too much to eat in one sitting . I will come back here again in the future"}
{"text":"The pancakes were terrible. They were rubbery and tasteless and thats even with the bananas added and syrup! 
My husband says his food was fine, so i recommend getting maybe anything else besides the pancakes. 

The service was fine and they even give you a free picture."}
{"text":"The food is great & the portions are big. The food is a bit pricey but it is worth it. I love the trees in the inside, but our service wasnt the best & she messed up our order or I would have given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Check your receipt before signing!!!!. We had a party of 8 and my elderly father was paying. The waitress gave him the bill and he just assumed it was correct. My niece said that seems like alot!. After going over the receipt it turned out the waitress had added someone elses table to our bill. When i asked her how does that happen, she said oh i thought you were all together!. We werent anywhere near the other table. It was a hassle to get it resolved. Check your receipts before you sign."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and with large portions. Diet?! Whats that?! You will def be hella full after eating here! 

Friendly staff, but not as attentive as I would expect. I had to keep asking random workers to find our server because they kept forgetting to bring my sides. 

Annnnnd I'm still waiting for Mickey... (See photo reference) lol"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and there are definitely dishes here that are better than others.  I'm vegetarian, so I'm limited to begin with; and I'm kind of a health nut, so that limits me further.  If you're at all like me, avoid the egg dishes with the hash browns; in my opinion, there wasn't enough taste to compensate for how much oil/butter/fat was clearly used.  On the other hand, the waffles with fruit are SO GOOD.  I haven't tried the pancakes, but plan to next time I'm there.  I haven't tried any of the dinner options (not many options there for vegetarians), but if you like having breakfast anytime, this place is open 24/7 and serves breakfast items all day and all night.  It's a handy place to come if it's midnight and you're starving!

The cool atmosphere is why you come here, essentially.  The food by itself isn't mind-blowing, but it has a cool vibe - and conveniently is open 24/7, for your round-the-clock eating needs.  I live here in Vegas, so I'm sure I'll be back many times in the future."}
{"text":"Looking for the quintesential Vegas dining experience on a reasonable budget? Your buck should stop here! This place is sooooo old Vegas it's worth a trip in itself! Typical diner food on a large portion scale with their signature dishes including such (somewhat healthy) items like their western fruit plate which is about two pounds of assorted fruit with a nice loaf of banana bread which is served with marshmellow butter/sauce! YUM! their bloody maria's are excellent and if you'd rather hang by the fire they have a lounge attached that has TV's and sunken living room seating with a fire pit. The interior of the entire facility is adorned with mirrors, obnoxious neon lighting and fake trees and plants! Devine old Vegas style! The Peppermill should also win your love because unlike most of our city that has changed, died or evolved over time the Peppermill has stood strong as a staple here in Vegas for many, many, many years! A final FYI: It's also an excellent place to people watch at 3am"}
{"text":"I remember going to the Peppermill in Reno when i was in high school and I remember the great buffet and the cool lighting.  On my recent trip to Vegas, we stopped by the restaurant and the atmosphere brought back memories.
The service was great and the staff was very friendly. We got a table the moment we walked in, but i think that was because it was a weekday. Waitress forgot about refilling drinks but apologized for the delay.  
The food portions are very large. We were able to try the other plates that our table ordered.  My sister enjoyed the multi colored sugar and she wanted to steal it.  They sell it at the counter so i bought her one when we went back the next day.  
They also have a really cool lounge that i might try to have a drink at when i visit again.  I will most likely go back when i visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Yes this the place all the locals go to after the late night, early morning dancing. It is not a hotel but I have seen heads resting on the table. I have nothing bad to say about Peppermill, the host get you seated right away. Drink orders are taking and brought back with precision timing. It is always a smile floating past you as you enjoy the atmosphere. Depending on how much you had to drink will determine how good the food taste. The food has kept Pepper  from falling into a drought for customers. Expect a wait for a few minutes, any popular place will have its high active hours."}
{"text":"One of those \"Vegas experiences\", you know?  A real glitzy, bright light, colorful Vegas vibe.  The big round booths are comfortable.  You won't be too disappointed by the MASSIVE portions.  I mean, pancakes larger than a frisbee (but luckily very soft and fluffy).  But beware, these portions can't really be finished unless you're a serious eating machine (or you're sharing one meal with, like, four people), and you will pay for them.  VERY expensive for what's essentially \"diner\" food.  For the experience, I think it's worth it once. 

I like that the cocktail waitresses come by almost right after you sit down to see if you want spirits from the Fireside lounge.  The service is hit or miss.  For instance, if you say you need a \"minute\" to review the menu, be prepared to wait a lifetime for the server to come back.  

There is a photographer that comes by to take a free souvenir photo of your party.  We got it one time and the last time we went, we were gone before they came back to give it to us.  

Let the bright lights draw you in; enjoy the over-the-top decor and a decent meal."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 2 stars because I don't like giving 1's and the food was just ok but it was honestly not a good experience at all.  Looking for a late night bite we found our way here because the reviews were pretty good and it was close by.  When we got inside it was an awkward ambience. The photos on yelp make it look a lot more appealing.  In person the feel is like a 1990's strip club with staff standing around talking to each other and not paying attention to their tables.  Our server was a young girl who was nice but completely lacked in the service area.  They should better train their staff to check on their tables.  We had to ask for our check after sitting there watching her talk to coworkers when we were ready to leave for quite some time.  I'm not going to mention her name because I don't want her to lose her job but honestly this place is just so bizarre and the food was barely mediocre.  Management needs to spend more time training the staff on basic hospitality."}
{"text":"Please do yourself a favor and venture of the strip to the Peppermill. Huge portions and affordable prices for the amount of food you get. And the best part, the food is great! Chicken Fried Steak was on point! Drinks were huge & reasonably price. The decor was the most brilliant, grotesque thing I'd ever seen."}
{"text":"I regret Not going here in the 14 years i lived here before i left. It looked kinda divey on the outside in my eyes. But you cant be at the same location for as long as i remember with crappy food and service. Upon walking in i was impressed with the layout. It looks funky with neon lights and plush seating. The hostess was friendly upon entering. And once seated took our drink orders rather quickly. The prices werent bad at all. And the food portions OMG. Ate at around 3 and i didnt not eat again all night besides little snacks here and there. Plus they come around and take your pictures and you can buy it if you want. Sure why not did the touristy thing for once. I shall be back Peppermill. MUAH."}
{"text":"Amazing, tasty portions and good prices! I thought it was a bit overpriced for breakfast ($30 for an omelet, coffee and OJ) but well worth it. If you have an appetite and don't mind the pricing, visit this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"The reviews in here were right in. The portions are huge!  I had the hash and eggs with a blueberry muffin. It was good! Just a lot to eat but I did after not eating for most of day."}
{"text":"Was told by so many people that this place was so good! Wrong! Just wrong 

Let's start with food 
I ordered chicken Alfredo and got a cold plate of soggy noodles sauce was tasteless and soupy yuck! The chicken was teriyaki flavored yes I was confused too. Cups were soap spotted and floors and tables were SO SO could have been better out friends who ordered alcohol waited 20 plus minutes and had to order twice employees looked like they hated there lives and it showed in customer service as well! The lounge area was great fire pit was cozy no service made it boring played weird outdated music videos . The bathroom was gross. If your wanting hot filling food don't do it!"}
{"text":"This place is next to encore hotel so a little off the strip but for the quantity so huge portions for cheap prices it's worth making a trip. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner 24 hours! It's diner type of foods but it's a great steal! Lots of choices for breakfast. Instead of spending 50 for some eggs on the strip, come try this place !"}
{"text":"What a perfect place to finish off a Vegas trip! I came here back in January with some friends. It was packed, the wait time was long, BUT you can chill in the lounge until a table is ready for you. The ambiance is so weird, but fun at the same time. I can't begin to describe the funky waitress outfits they have. 

After spending the weekend on the strip glaring at all the overpriced food and beverage spots, I had the best affordable cup of coffee EVERRRR. The average price for meals was about $10-15. I got the Pesto Chicken Sandwich with fruit and it was SOOOO GOOD. I tried my friend's Country Fried Steak--it was AMAZING. Portions are huge and you really get what you pay for! 

Great for tourists...open 24 hours, plenty of parking, take debit/credit, slots in waiting area, souvenir group photos, and an experience to remember! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Place was okay with decent food. I think a regular breakfast would be fine here but I got their special omelet which was questionable. Service wasn't great. They forgot about us midway during the meal."}
{"text":"Wasn't very impressed. If you're looking for expensive diner food, come here. I ordered egg Benedict with hash browns and it came out to $22... Our waitress wasn't knowledgable about the menu and didn't proudly represent the restaurant. The food made me ill the next day.

Don't recommend."}
{"text":"This is a must!!! My first time in Vegas and I knew we had to go here. We had brunch. Great  old cheesy Vegas style decor. HUGE portions!!!! SHARE!!!  Had the Bubble Bath drink while we waited. It was yummy too"}
{"text":"Great food, great times with the family.  They have huge servings of food so don't be shocked at the prices. Definitely try a Virgin Pina Colada it is amazing.    They also have a photographer on hand to take photo's for you, he is funny, well at least the one we had.   Check it out if  your in Las Vegas.  Denny's is right behind but you will enjoy this so much better."}
{"text":"The place is quite Vegas-style, neon lights, a little dark but it isn't too noisy. Food was very good, we tried mostly burgers but also the creamy chicken dijon and the salmon. All of us liked it very much. Service is good as well."}
{"text":"I finally had breakfast here, after years of hearing about how great this place it. It's just ok. The service was GREAT. The atmosphere - Vegas. My husband loved his Bloody Mary and I have to say the sip I had was pretty good. 

HOWEVER.....

I had a big problem with all the meat being so salty. The bacon, sausage (links and patties) and ham were just too salty. I took bites off everyone's plate. :) 

Eggs were good. Pancakes were good. But the salty meat made the entire meal an overall Meh for me. 

My friends were very happy."}
{"text":"Walked ALL the way down the strip to eat here because my bf's cousin said it was the best place ever.  It was packed and the food was pretty good but nothing really special.  It was also way over priced....$14 for a skillet...  The pancakes seemed like a good deal though, they were huge. A normal person could probably only eat a a quarter of them."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to check out the iconic bar. It's a lot smaller than I thought. I thought there was many fire pit booths but it's just one and then few couch seating areas around the fire pit. It's a cool bar and prices are decent during happy hour. A comfortable place to relax with friends and have a drink."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Peppermill! Closer to the Encore & Wynn end of the strip this restaurant is definitely not one to be missed! Have visited twice during my most recent Vegas trip and am hoping to make it back one more time before I leave.

Super funky decor- weird indoor trees with fairy lights instead of leaves and cute 70's style diner booth seating. Staff are extremely friendly and more than happy to help you out with menu recommendations.
Top of my list- the Nachos (be warned- they are HUGE) and the Corned Beef Hash Burger with Curly Fries. My God it is heaven! Food is fresh and comes out quickly. Be sure to bring an appetite!"}
{"text":"Visited this place after seeing it on a Nachos top 10 in Vegas list. Ordered the $15 nachos and $25 Salmon. This food was absolutly awful, I would rather eat nachos from Del Taco. Absolute waste of money. The salmon was cooked well, but had no flavor, none what so ever. I will never return, and i will express to the people I work with to never visit.  I would love to see Chef Ramsey tear this place apart.  Extremely disappointed. I feel like I got robbed by eating here.. I wanted to walk out and not even pay, it was so bad. If I could give it no stars I would."}
{"text":"Had the chicken with Dijon sauce, was excellent. The mashed potatoes were especially creamy and good. Service was good. The ambiance was old hooker Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious diner food! The coffee was okay, but the food was great! As previously stated, the portions are huge. My sister and I read up on the place beforehand so we knew to share. :) We ordered an omelet, which was *so* good, and ONE pancake - which was also yum.
Don't be afraid to accept the free photograph you are offered while you are waiting/eating! It *is* free. You can buy a couple paper frames if you want them. We did! And then gave it to my mom as a souvenir. :)
Since we went in for breakfast, on the way out, we went into the bar area just to see the fireplace. Pretty cool! They let us take photos and walk around."}
{"text":"Come here for the atmosphere. It is beautifully vintage Las Vegas; Robert de Niro and Sharon stone brought me here. The food is good but nothing out of this world. We went here for breakfast on a Saturday morning , nice portions really big and tasty French toast. The service is good as well, mostly young employees. I would return if I am feeling nostalgic. It's seems like it would better to have a few drinks here."}
{"text":"Vibe here is kinda cool with the neon lights.Food comes in huge portions.Prices are about normal for being on the strip.Everything tasted alright but not worth me driving across town to come back."}
{"text":"Man this place is rad.

If your heading out for drinks, bring that special someone to the ultimate swank make-out den. Hot pink, neon and black dominate your vision and the plants make excelent blinds for your canoodling endeavors. The drinks are spot on and strong as hell and are served by lovely ladies in evening dresses.

If you're looking to eat, holy hell, I hope you're hungry.

I wont lie, the price on the meal is a bit expensive, but what isn't in Vegas, eh?

You get portions, my friend, portions to end all hunger. The breakfast is wonderful. The food is amazingly delicious. The only poor experienced Ive had here was when I couldn't eat my food one night after I had drank WAYYYYYYYY  to much, not your fault Peppermill, that was all me. My bad.. You know I still love you.

EAT HERE."}
{"text":"There's never a dull moment at the Peppermill.  The drinks and people watching opportunity are to die for.  The food is diner style grub.

There are 2 sides, the dining room on the right or the lounge to the left.  If you're feeling social, sit on the lounge side.  It's not uncommon for total strangers to just strike up a random conversation.  The lounge has a nice ambiance with fiery water pits.

This spot should be on the Vegas 'Must Visit' list for it's classy meets seedy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Can't believe I didn't know about this place until I saw it on a reality show! The wait is long but well worth it! Big portions of delicious food! Next time in Vegas you will find me here for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Warning, however, the portions are HUGE.  The Denver omelet literally has a dozen eggs in it. Prepare to split a meal unless you can eat tons of food at one sitting!"}
{"text":"Yes indeed, old school vegas at it's best!.....The decor just screams vintage. Cool purple/blue lighting and vibe inside.

Full disclaimer....their portions are huge!!!.....At first glance, I was wondering why my eggs were so expensive, I soon realized it was because their omelets are made with 10 eggs!

Overall, a nice place to visit."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas. Old timey Vegas feel with lots of velvet seats, mirrors, and neon lights. The food was excellent (chicken fried steak n eggs) and the portions were massive. Grab a coffee or liquid libation in the lounge while you wait. Service was A+ as well. Will be making this a staple every time I visit Sin City."}
{"text":"Old school charm.  Huge portions of all your breakfast favorites.  This place cranks and for good reason.  Good, and affordable food for all and they are very efficient with getting you taken care of.  This seems to be almost an institution or right of passage when you come to LV.  You have to come at least once to experience the history of it all.  Although it was an older establishment I didn't feel it was dirty or I'd get sick.  The food was very good and the staff was even better.  I'd come back for sure"}
{"text":"Not living up to the hype. I was hoping to try something good, since I heard good things about Peppermill..but
Prices are expensive. I did like the vibe, but it took over 15 minutes to get waited on with water, and took a very long time as well to get our food. My friend did love her eggs benedict."}
{"text":"The place has absolutely changed over the years, was there for breakfast the day after Valentines Day, had told my girlfriend so much about this place only for us both to be disappointed. Truly the end of an era when the Bloody Mary's are no longer the best in the city and the food comes out bland. RIP Peppermill!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and there's a reason this place has been a Vegas icon since the 70s. The place has the look of a combination of a bar from a 1980s sci fi movie and a local diner, and there are flamingo laden lamps above each table. The service is very friendly/laid back but one weird thing is if you order a drink they have to send a separate cocktail waitress from the attached lounge to take your drink order. 

As for the food itself, the Baja Burger was just right with some green chiles, pepper jack cheese, and bacon along with a side of homemade onion rings . The Corona-rita is a giant margarita with a Corona bottle attached and it the perfect accompaniment to a huge burger.

They have a gigantic menu and I'll be back here to check this place out again."}
{"text":"The food at the Peppermill gets five stars, but the service that we experienced this past Saturday got a one star. We went around 10:30 AM in the morning and it was super busy. I have been to the Peppermill before and it was not as busy earlier in the morning and we had just as good food but way better customer service. When this place is busy, customer service is compromised. Our waitress barely checked on us, never refilled or coffee, got one order wrong, and so on and so on and so on.
The portions of food are massive so it is easy for two people to share a plate. There are many options and the menu is fast, whether you are getting breakfast or lunch or dinner. Their breakfast is excellent.
The location is close to between the main strip and downtown Las Vegas and is easy to get to."}
{"text":"Got lucky this Saturday night around 11pm as there was no wait at all, and we got seated when we arrived. Service is a little slow but the atmosphere can keep you entertained. Portions are huuuge. Definitely worth the $$ in my opinion. Oh but pass on the Broskins. They were dry and not very good. Onion rings are AMAZING, along with the peppermill pastrami burger and Ive never been disappointed by a breakfast here. Overall I love this place. It reminds me of a Dennys....but on crack....Vegas style. Try it!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!!!!

Don't let the outside food you. I thought this was a stripclub or weird bar at first glance, but you walk inside and restaurant! 80s themed awesomeness. Neon lights, colorful booths, and sprinkles on the tables. Service was great. Spot on! I ordered the mammoth pancakes, which I greatly under appreciated the size as described in the menu. I also didn't heed the waitresses advice, thinking she didn't appreciate my ability to down the cake. HOLY CRAP! Those are insane! Yeah, these pancakes could feed a family.  The food was great. Atmosphere was great. Prices were very cheap for Vegas. It wasn't a cliche place in one of the casinos, so a wonderful change of pace.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was good but wow way over priced!!!!!! 5 bucks for an orange juice WTF is up with that..... I can get the same thing for half the price at Denny's thank you very much.."}
{"text":"A local recommended Peppermill to my family on our recent trip to LV.  We went for brunch and found it was packed.  The neon lights made it look more like a strip club than a diner (I've never been to a strip club, I'm assuming from what I've seen on How I Met Your Mother...) We had about a 10 minute wait before we were seated- all of the staff were very friendly.

I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap.  It was served with a massive amount of fries, but they had a funny taste (not sure what type of oil they use?).  My wrap had more tomatoes and lettuce than chicken, disappointingly..  My relatives ordered the french toast, which was a huge portion, and they really seemed to enjoy it.  Overall, an inexpensive place to eat with a variety of choices, but not a \"top\" restaurant by any means."}
{"text":"Sweet and simple from  a hotel and restaurant background. service from entry great and friendly staff great atmosphere and fast service and pretty good food . If ya want to sure a appetizers with a friend or even a army go with the Nachos!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Las Vegas. Liliya and Stacy are very friendly and accommodating. I have been here many times and only after receiving continuous immaculate service have I decided to leave a good review. This place truly deserves five stars."}
{"text":"Disappointed after reading the other reviews.  Ate breakfast on a Labor Day Sunday and the wait was about 45 min.  Portions are definitely huge (especially pancakes) but prices reflect that so its not like you're getting some great deal.  Service was pretty slow with long waits to order and to get our food (simple breakfast stuff like french toast and omelets), food coming out at different times, and another wait to get the check.  Food was merely OK.  Our group had french toast (recommended by an employee, but nothing special at all), a fruit plate (very big), oatmeal (pretty good, but $11 for oatmeal?!?!), a caesar salad, and an omelet.  

The atmosphere is fine, but not as fun as I thought it might be from the other reviews.  

No one was impressed.  Big portions doesn't make up for mediocre food.  Maybe other food is better, but breakfast wasn't."}
{"text":"Had the Peppermill pastrami burger and it was excellent! Fast and friendly service, reasonably priced for Vegas. Actually anywhere! I would come back for more... I say get away from the hotels and explore. The Peppermill is an example of a great find when you take a chance!"}
{"text":"All i have to say is this place is - Grrrrreat ! Very relaxing lounge and good place to eat after midnight ."}
{"text":"Long Island, NY is the island of diners. Many hours of my youth was spent in diners after a night of concert going and partying. Peppermill is high on the list of fabulous diners serving great food. Open 24 hours it is guaranteed to fill your dining needs. 

The place is beautifully designed in my favorite jewel tone colors right down to the sugar crystals. There is an indoor fire pit with water features and Elvis videos that I am dying to go back and hang out in before I order some more delicious food. 

Got to see the neon sign before it is retired to the @NeonMuseum. It's being replaced with LED. 

Our waitperson was informative and friendly. Serving there for 35 years. I don't know about you, but I've never done anything for 35 years. We ordered the Swiss mushroom burger that came highly recommended by my Bae. I ordered it with fries, he with onion rings. Devine. 

High on the list of places to return to when I get homesick for my New York diner fix or after a night in LV!"}
{"text":"Their service is extremely slow. Their food isn't worth the wait. Their portions are ginormous which is the only positive aspect of this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the go-to spots after you get fucked up and want to get fucked up even more (or if you want to sober up).

Anything is good and with big portions you can't go wrong with anything but my go-to is always the Hot Pastrami Sandwich, any breakfast items or any burgers..."}
{"text":"Awesome place atmosphere,staff,food, and the Hawaiian mimosas were absolutely delicious!!! You get what you pay for here specially in vegas definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for my brother's birthday dinner this year while in Vegas. I was excited to try the giant portions everyone talks about, but unfortunately they only serve appetizers on the fireside part of the restaurant/bar. 

The indoor fire pits are awesome. The appetizers on the other hand are very mediocre. We got a bunch on different ones to share and the only one I thought was good were the Sriracha chicken bites. 

It's a cool vibe, so it's worth checking out, but there appetizers definitely could use some improvement."}
{"text":"oh Peppermill, how I miss thee.

The wife and I love going to the Peppermill when we're in Vegas.
The service is friendly, the ambiance is chill, the portions are ridiculously huge, and the drink menu has tons of options.
There can sometimes be a wait, but that's expected from a well known joint on the strip.


Can't wait to stop by here again next time I'm in Sin City."}
{"text":"Good spot.

Came in late night (is 3 am late in Vegas?) alone and sat at the \"bar\". I ordered a chocolate milkshake and it was delicious.

Wanted to write a review so I could mention the wonderful service I received, but since it was a month ago I completely forget her name. If management is reading this, she was 18-19 years old, just started college for dental school (she wanted to be a dentist).
She was probably the nicest server I've had in LV. Hopefully she reads this and gets a pat on the back (and a bonus)."}
{"text":"One of the coolest dinners you will ever go to... massive menu!  Get the nachos."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great diner, this is it!  I have never had a bad meal there.  The only challenge, is making a decision.  Also you better come hungry as no one has ever left the Peppermill hungry.  I always bring folks here so that they can get a taste of old Vegas and some good food as well."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing except for the lame music inside the lounge. They need to upgrade the music to make it perfect for the customers. I know I would be there a lot more if the music was good. I'm sure that goes for a lot of people."}
{"text":"Spunky, surreal neon decor with leggy waitresses wearing shiny hose. Famous amongst locals and was in the movie Swingers I hear. Right next to the Riviera down a ways on the strip. Service was good and the food quite tasty. Lots of variety. I was in Vegas on business and ate there twice. The ribeye was quite good and they didn't overcook it which, to me at least, is vital. The next time I got the gyro which was tasty but the lamb was just OK. No one was displeased with their meal as far I remember. If you're cruising through Vegas and want to try something very authentically \"Vegas\" but also desire a good meal and don't want to break the bank, Peppermill's the spot.

Open 24 hours by the way and oh yeah, if you're a drunkard this place is also optimal as they have a fireside lounge which seems to cater to the party crowd."}
{"text":"The Peppermill has always been talked about through social media! 

Peppermill this...
Peppermill that...

I've heard enough about the Peppermill restaurant being a Vegas staple on the strip so I had to check it out for myself. I was craving steak for breakfast but the Americano Cafe in Caesar's Palace had their steak at a high mark up $45+!! I did some researching and found that the Peppermill's steak was only $28. So I got on a Uber for only $7 to get to the restaurant to try it out.

Excited and thrilled I was when I got there because there was no wait at all. It's located just north of Encore and across from Resorts World. The inside kinda resembled a 70's Vegas style cafe, kinda what you'd expect when the mob ran the hotels and designed it with lots and lots of velvet and 70's neon lighting. 

My Ribeye steak was huge and it came with a freshly made salad with three pieces of huge Texas style toast. The steak was cooked perfectly to what I preferred (Rare). I love my steaks bloody and juicy. From time to time, my waitress checked on me and quickly refilled my water. Just checking the decor makes you feel like you time warped back to the 70's era of Las Vegas. I consider this cafe a win win!"}
{"text":"What do you get when take a diner, a romantic lounge and circa 70s/80s Vegas and mix it all together in a blender? The Peppermill of course!

This is a place that serves as a fond memory from childhood from me. I remember going with my mom or my grandparents to meet up with my aunt when she worked at the Stardust (now long gone). Many times we would come here for breakfast. The Stardust is a childhood memory that I feel was taken from me. But this place still remains.

As an adult, I love the Peppermill more than ever. Price-wise, it isn't the cheapest. It's pretty much an upscale version of a diner though, so that can be forgiven, especially considering how large the portions are. Last time I went, I had chicken fingers with fries. I received four chicken fingers and could only finish two of them before I was stuffed. And that was on the appetizer menu, mind you. I fondly remember the breakfast platters from when I was a kid, and while I haven't ordered one in a while, they always look like something to die for. Memo: get one of those next time. 

Another thing I remember always being curious about as a kid was the lounge. I would stomp my feet, demanding to see it. Everyone always talked about how beautiful it was and I was never allowed to check it out. Wahh wahh wahh!!! Haha. Well, I'm legal now, and actually can spend time in there. And yes, it was worth the hype. It's intimate and quite lovely, albeit in the campiest way possible with the fake trees, gold barricades and 70s-style pink tube lighting. Alas, even without a date it's worth it to spend an hour or two in there if only for the ambiance. Don't worry, no one will look at you funny. 

The Peppermill is quite the oddity on The Strip, a borderline mystery even. As it's immediate surroundings become increasingly desolate, not only does it continue to stand but every time you go in the place, it's still packed. You're lucky if you're even able to grab a seat at the diner. A strange happening indeed. Not that I'm one to complain. 

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Vegas classic.
Retro vibe and feel.
Beautiful lounge.
Huge portions. 

Cons:
Not the cheapest food, but the portions make up for that.
Not the cheapest drinks, but the ambiance makes up for that.
Can feel a little bit campy, but it works.

Return Factor: 10/10. I'm always down."}
{"text":"food is always good and hot... i like this place. this food almost tastes as good as mine... of course mine taste better but their's was second runner-up...    :) friendly staff. Open 24 seven."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever experienced. The servers are rude. The manager is terrible. The cocktail waitress have no idea what they're doing. The food was great but it took forever to get to us. I was terribly disappointed after reading so many good reviews. Do nooooot recommend."}
{"text":"I went here the first time in about 1974. We went there nightly in those days. We ate in the front and drank in the lounge. Well, many years passed and my husband is always looking for things to surprise me with in Vegas. It seldom works. But he said I'm taking you to somewhere really different and when we pulled in I laughed. I hadn't been here in at least 20 years. We went to the lounge and ordered a drink by the firepit. That was fantastic. Then we ordered food and literally nothing was good. Totally inedible. So, my advice stick to drinks. I'd give it 5 stars for drinks, 1 for food, and -10 for the creeps in the parking lot. Still overall really fun."}
{"text":"It's a classic. You must check it out. Anthony Bourdain said so. However, the only thing to order here are the drinks in the Fireside Lounge. Trust. 

We ordered the nacho's one night thinking it would be a good picky pick. Wrong! The heighth of the \"fixin's\" nearly hits the 12\" mark! We ordered a side if chips to just dig into it. After 10 minutes we gave up & offered them to our fellow fireside-ers. 

It's a fun 80's Vegas meets Disney room and very fun to chill in. Order a mai tai and enjoy the whack."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, huge portions, friendly staff. Come here for the real Vegas experience."}
{"text":"The cocktail lounge at the Pepper Mill is a straight shot out of 1970s vintage Las Vegas. But it is not recreated, it is original!

Sit by the blue pool with flames bursting out of it, and order a Blue Hawaiian. This is the only bar in the world I know of, that has Blue Hawaiians \"on the gun.\" And strangely, they are not overly sweet. Beautiful cocktail waitresses bring you little bottles of peanuts and snacky things. You will be in heaven, with one eye on the door, waiting for Sinatra to bust in at any minute."}
{"text":"This place should be called Disco Denny's. There's also a Denny's like a block from here.  The decor, neon lights everywhere, fire pits, waitress outfits, flamingo lights over the tables is something to behold.

Portions are huge and prices are fare.  I ate here before for breakfast and enjoyed it much more than my last experience.

Our waitress was slow to arrive.  Although they were not busy they sat us way way way in the back next to the family with screaming/hellbent children that were literally kicking glasses of water on the table. yeah kicking w/ their feet, why you ask? b/c they were standing on the table.  

Notice there was some garbage items on the floor when we first got in there, later saw a guy sweeping them up. Looked at the menu, tried to decide on some real diner food. No grilled cheese on the menu?  No tomato soup?  Ordered the Gyro with fries, friend ordered a salad with a grilled cheese [they can make one]  and my veggie friend ordered the Caprese sandwich [she had some issues finding something to order and mentioned it wasn't very veggie friendly]

Gyro arrived and it had this clumpy Tzatziki sauce on it made out of onions and something. It wasn't very good.  It was also very greasy.  I pushed some of the white slop off the top and ate the meat out of it.  The pita bread was soggie from the grease :(.  and it was also missing lettuce.  

Everyone seemed to be ordering the sundaes.  Walked passed a guy who had his tennis shoes OFF and was eating his sundae, GROSS.

I wasn't that impressed."}
{"text":"This review is based on one visit.  The decorations were very unique and the staff was very friendly.  The food was not seasoned in any way and was expensive for the quantity/quality.  I had the Peppermill Burger with fries; the meat was supposed to be 1/2 lb. but seemed like 1/4 lb. and the fries had no salt.  My wife had the NY Steak and baked potato; the steak was not seasoned and the baked potato was not fully cooked."}
{"text":"Any time I'm in Vegas, this is a must stop for breakfast. Huge portions-- the omelettes are made with 10 eggs so easily shareable. I love the Belgian waffles as well. They have the perfect balance of crips outside and fluffy inside. The mimosas and Bellinis are good too. On the lighter side the fruit and yogurt parfait are delicious too. Never disappointed with peppermill."}
{"text":"Food is not all that and the place looks to outdated i know is like an 80's dinner but they can do better, we had some drinks at the bar, The Bloody Mary tasted like water down tomato juice lol I had the whole stalk of celery in it, my lemon was old and bitter it was just a bad experience. I will not go back"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a Vegas version of Denny's but with large portions and retro décor. It really does look like it a throwback version of what Vegas was in the 70's. The employees wear weird costumes that I don't quite understand. The waitresses dress in blue and white overall/romper get-ups and the bartenders wear ball gowns....it's just unexplainable. But the service itself was sort of slow. It seemed as if there were more employees on the clock than actual customers. 

The do have a guy who comes around and takes photos to capture your dining experience. It's sort of like Buca di Beppo and you get a complimentary photo with your meal. The photographer did inform us he wasn't with the restaurant and worked off commission so it was kind of awkward not buying the photo....

But as far as the food, it's mostly breakfast options, the portions are large, and it's relatively inexpensive.  I had the Crab Cake Bene (poached eggs and grilled crab cakes on toasted English muffins, smothered in Hollandaise sauce) and I opted for the Hollandaise sauce on the side rightfully so because it was REALLY thick and salty. The crab cakes were already heavily salted down so it really didn't need to be lathered, smothered or bathed in any salt. 

This place has a decent location, decent price; ok food, LARGE portions, sort of outdated and gimmicky but possess a charm none-the-less. I wouldn't suggest the Crab Cake Bene nor any of their other lunch items but they do serve Breakfast all day 24hrs so it seems like a great drunk place to visit. Other than that its mehhhh"}
{"text":"Sad fact: I've lived in Vegas for over seven years, and it's only recently that I had a chance to eat here. Sad, I know, but with the Riviera closing recently, the lure of \"Old Vegas\" got me in the mood to try more classics.

Worth the wait.

The place scream '80's neon decor. It's a lively atmosphere with music videos on the TVs. Without a doubt, the vibe of the place was the biggest appeal to me here. I tried one of their benedicts, and the flavor had me charging through my meal (it can be said in my defense that I was very hungry that night). Again, I sampled their Bloody Mary, and that was \"Yes\" and \"Please\".

I did not, however, sample their Fireside Lounge this outing, but I did go in to check it out. I love their fire pit. It's really impressive, and now I have to find an excuse to go dress up and experience it proper.

This is a classic restaurant. My only regret is not visiting it sooner now that I've been able to experience its food and appeal. While I have grumbled in the past that Vegas doesn't respect its history, I hope they have the smarts to leave this landmark location alone, and let it continue to do its thing.

I can see this becoming one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"Everything you read in reviews for this restaurant is true. When you enter the restaurant you are seemingly transported back in time to an earlier Vegas. The service is outstanding, with separate waitresses for your food and cocktails. They mix a mean bloody mary! You better bring a huge appetite because the portions here are incredibly large and tasty."}
{"text":"Awesomely neon restaurant with great (albeit a little overpriced) diner-style food and an \"old Vegas\" feel.  When meeting out-of-towners for breakfast or lunch on the Strip area, I try to take them here for the experience.  Standard breakfast fare is consistently good and so are the reuben and french fries.  Have a drink in the Fireside Lounge if you have time, or at least poke your head inside - it's trippy."}
{"text":"It's awesome that the tackiness of this place is so upfront. The plastic plants aren't off in the corner, they're dangling off the tops of the booths right in your face. Excellent. We had about 30 min. to wait to be seated, so we played some video blackjack in the lounge and had some screwdrivers. Ended up winning enough to cover our monster breakfast. I had the Marco pollo omelette, my wife had the eggs benny and we barely touched the massive serving of hash browns that accompanied both dishes. Service was very friendly from the lounge to our server to the cashier. Will make this a regular Vegas stop."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Open super late, which is nice, and has a very vast menu. My favorite is the tomato and mozzarella sandwich, and their sundaes are giant!

Great for families or tourists."}
{"text":"Big portion plates!
Great food!
The lounge is relaxing and their alcoholic drinks are good!
I always have to make a stop here when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Allow me to be blunt: this place is fucking amazing!!  Every time I find myself in Vegas, I end up drinking myself into oblivion and eating like crap.  So after a few days, when my body is pissed off and my liver is overworked and ready to pack up and call it quits, I know it's time for some serious foodage to restore my partying abilities.  Time to go to Peppermill!

Yeah, one plate of food here could probably feed an entire army of ravenous adolescent boys.  Still, I can never seem to agree on a dish to split with my friends, so I always end up ordering something for myself, only to eat and eat and eat for like 45 minutes to maybe get through 1/4 of the food before I wave my white flag of surrender and admit that I have once again been dominated by the Peppermill.  No joke, the omelets are bigger than my head, and they should probably give you a shovel to eat the side of hash browns with.  However, quality has not been sacrificed for quantity.  The food tastes amazing, no matter if you go for lunch at noon or for a drunken munchie run at 4 AM.

I'd give it 5 stars, but I'm taking off one because I don't particularly like the part of the strip that it's located in.  Sorry Peppermill, otherwise, you're perfecto!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place to just hang out, relax with friends and people watch, a real throwback type place, lots of neon and mirrors, so tacky but done in a way that actually doesn't make it seem tacky.

For some reason I think the place used to be darker, with the higher level of lighting it has lost a little bit of the \"secret hideaway\" atmosphere, but heck I like it and it isn't far to walk to get some good food."}
{"text":"The wait was long, but we knew that going into it. Was told 20 minutes - ended up being a little over 40.

As soon as we sat down, we were approached by someone who took our coffee and water orders (not the waiter) then came the cocktail waitress. Those came out with lightning speed. After that, everything became snail paced.

Our waiter was clearly overwhelmed and didn't acknowledge us for a while - did mention to us a couple times that he'd be right with us as he was zipping past. After a while, my friend got impatient and headed to speak with a manager and that's when our waiter showed up to take our order. Coincidentally.

Manager made sure our food came out quickly so that was nice. Food was decently good which is why this is a 3-star and not one. That and cus the bloody mary was so so good.

Got the crab cake benedict which was delicious - the eggs were made perfectly.
Eggs benedict was incredible as well - my husband said it was one of the best ones he's had which is great since that's what they're known for.

my buddy got the feta cheese omelette which he says he gets all the time.

Biscuits and gravy - YUM. perfect biscuits smothered in a sausage gravy oh my goodness.

Food 4/5, service 1/5, manager redemption makes this a 3/5."}
{"text":"We found this place on Google as it was close to where our son was staying for a conference. It is a colorful place to stop for dinner. Portions are generous and staff is so friendly. our server was fast with the drinks and kept them full for the whole time we were there. The food was delicious and the plates are full when they arrive! the salads have no icky greens and the dressing is tasty. We will come again"}
{"text":"I went Wednesday after being wasted from a bottle service Night Swim at the club and we just had our server Heather surprise us and Jesse the busser suggested same dish and it was perfect... Like seriously expected crappy carb loaded diner food and it was great.  Roasted red pepper pasta and the conquest burger.  So YUMMA !!! .... The lounge is kinda cool too!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was worth the taxi ride! The food was great and affordable! The atmosphere was fun and it is nice that it is a little bit off the strip and away from the chaos. The portions were huge and my friend and I ordered several items to split between us. There are great breakfast options and there is a very casual vibe"}
{"text":"Always a must go to eat at the Pepper mill. Great big portions of food. Friendly staff and awesome fire lounge. I ordered French dip sandwich, it was great tasting loved the sauce to dip with. It also came with sweet potato fries which were exquisite. This place is always packed so keep in mind that there is always a long wait but that's why I wait in the bar lounge area and order the great tasting bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Had an excellent time at Fireside lounge. I sat right next to one of the fire pit areas with my wife which was very romantic. We had some appetizers and a few drinks. The drinks could have been cheaper, but I enjoyed the atmosphere and the experience."}
{"text":"I am one of the many who trekked to this old school restaurant because of Mr. Bourdain.

And damn was he right again!

It is CRUCIAL that you get seated in fireside lounge. We almost got seated in the regular diner area and that is not the experience you should be looking for!

My boyfriend and I split a scorpion bowl and a plate of chicken strips and fries. Both were gigantic and plenty for both of us. They are particularly generous with their fries.

Our waitress was very friendly I loved the dim lighting and ambiance overall.

Only downside is that it wasn't a cheap cab ride there. But it is worth it, believe me!

Can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Vegas so I can get a seat right in front of the fireplace!"}
{"text":"Came here after leaving Luna Hooka. They are within walking distance. It was about 3 in the morning and this place was jumping! We were seated immediately. In a circle booth with a table that was bolted to the floor. Now I'm a fat ass so when I tell you that I was SQUISHED in that booth....I was squished in that booth. What I didn't like is that there is a cocktail waitress and a food waitress. You can't order drinks unless you order them through the cocktail waitress and her tail was nowhere to be found. We ordered the sampler platter and split it. It was HOT and the same quality of Applebee's (yes, put your nose in the air food snobs!) I was hungry and it hit the spot. Friendgirl thought it was really good, but I think that she was just hungry too, although she tends not have the discerning palette that I have. Would I come back, nope because Denny's is next door and I would have rather had that. It's okay if you just need something quick and inexpensive, but with so many restaurants on the strip......"}
{"text":"Come with your appetite!! The serving sizes are huge! There is plenty of chicken on the Gourmet Chicken Salad. Lots of ice cream in the Strawberry Shortcake. Service was quick, even though I was with a big group."}
{"text":"A Vegas institution with crazy, straight-out-of-the-1970s decor and a greasy-spoon menu that makes the Jersey in me smile. After all, don't get it twisted. This is a diner. It's just dressed like Frank Marino. Not much need to comment on the food. If you're here chances are you're probably drunk. It's good enough even if you're not. But you don't come to the Peppermill because it's a great meal. You come to the Peppermill because it's visually an acid flashback."}
{"text":"This will be short and simple:

If you want a diner, this is only place in vegas to go to.  Always a wait.  But it is a typical diner with all the menu items.  Omelet is huge!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is always awesome!  Its right next door to the Riviera which is usually our home base.

We went there late night last night and a sudden craving for breakfast hit while I was staring at the menu.  I ordered the Lorraine omelet which had a ton of bacon, green onions and swiss cheese.  Their omelets are out of control.  They are GIGANTIC!  It was super tasty too!  It comes with a side of some awesome hashbrowns and 2 pieces of toast.  I got sourdough and it was perfect....they even butter up the bread for you too so all you have to do is apply the strawberry jelly.  I washed it down with a gigantic chocolate shake.  The wife ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup and had some of my hashbrowns.  It was another excellent meal, and the Peppermill remains one of my favorite spots in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love this place been coming here since I was 5, great environment, great service, they feed like there's no tomorrow, better then a buffet, cause buffet you get hungry  after like a hour and half later, so I recommend eating here 100 stars"}
{"text":"It's 330 AM, you've just had a few cosmos and now you're HANGRY. What's the first place that comes to mind? Most think \"Breakfast\" at that hour. Some think \"Strip Club\" I thought \"Disco!\". Sooooooooo, I scrolled all the hot YELP reviewed sites and saw my fav girl Bobbi's review on this place called THE Peppermill. 

So, naturally,  after reading about this place from a Yelper whose reviews I trust, find very humorous, not to mention a girl I absolutely adore from 3,000 miles away, I HAD to come here when I was in Vegas. 

Walking in, you're greeted with the blue and purple neon strip club lights. The music is on all the TV's. Classic Rock, some pop scattered here and there and when I entered GNR was playing on the TV's.  Okay. Peppermill, Ya had me at GNR.

So, breakfast was ordered as I sat staring at a little water pond with a fire place in the middle.  It was a step down kind of pit, and it was so oooooo relaxing I soon almost nodded off. 

Breakfast was fast and huge!  It's like IHOP on steroids. I have always loved little cheese places like this to people watch and you definitely get some characters in The Peppermill at 330-5am. .... I can't help it, I love to observe cheesy places (The Cats in the Fiddle in Hollywood, The Rainbow in Hollywood, The STANDARD just about anywhere) and am often not diapointed by Good Times and cheesy fun!   

You know fun exciting times are about to happen any second because you never know who is going to walk through that door in Vegas."}
{"text":"Only ate there once then went to Denny's down the street the remainder of the week. Friendly staff, but the food isn't worth it. Oversized large portions with grease piled in on & around. I just don't feel it was worth the price or the older run down seating. 
I guess if you're looking for that 70's feel of triply lights & grease this is your place!"}
{"text":"This place is a good time and its old school, it has been seen in many movies like \"Casino\".  If you want a piece of old Vegas that makes stiff drinks come here!"}
{"text":"Doesn't count as a Vegas trip unless you come here. HUGE portions, extensive drink menu and over-the-top decor. LV at its finest!"}
{"text":"There is something intriguing about this place when you enter. It takes me back to a time when restaurants felt like this. A feeling I can't explain, a feeling just known.

After a few more visits, safe to say service has been pretty consistent and the food is certainly shareable. Unless..you're drunk and hungry and can kill it all by yourself. I, on the other hand, have been able to take leftovers home. Price is quite Denny prices, but similar to prices you'd find at hash house. Honestly, it pick this place over Denny's just because of its ambiance. 

My first experience with Peppermill was in Reno and completely loved the lounge firepit lounge, though, I have yet to visit the lounge at this location despite it being in the same building. 

I thought their food was good and something about those rainbow sugar crystals which I have no idea why they chose to have that on the table...but because it's the Peppermill...it makes sense. Like, why wouldn't they have rainbow colored sugar crystals?! Lol.

It's a great spot to dine and lounge along the strip without having to be IN the casinos. I've seen children in there so it's certainly kid friendly in the dining area. You could even get away with rolling a stroller in as well. Lots of booth seatings. When it's time to pay, you walk up to the register. I'm sure handing it to your waitress is a option as well, but don't grump if your waitress never returns after she hands you your tab.

Definitely worth a try! Certainly a place to take visitors to eat or chill. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is where hookers go to find husbands. The kind of husbands whose names are Bubba and drive 18 Wheelers.

The Peppermill knows how to keep things klassy (with a K) with their indoor waterfall fire pit and their long-black-dress-with-the-hip-length-slit clad waitresses.

The 80's lounge style seating, the free nuts, the bartender who pours you well vodka when you asked for Grey Goose, the 1993 music videos playing on all the non flat screen TVs.

This place pulls out all the stops for it's pretentious, well spoken, fur wearing guests.

Classy to a T.

The best part about the Peppermill? This establishment knows that its got it going on!! w00t w00t!

This place was awesome and very chill. They took care of our pre-drink needs and we even ordered some snacks. I love me a time trap bar.

Keep it classy Peppermill, keep it classy."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place. It seems to have gone the route of many other Las Vegas restaurants; large portions at large prices. I'm always amazed that people will excitedly say \"the portions are huge! woohoo!\" without taking into consideration that they just paid for two dinners worth of food that they couldn't possibly finish. French fries are no good the next day. What's the point of spending $18.95 on a hamburger and a pillowcase full of french fries that you can't finish and that isn't good the next day?

On top of this the service was terrible and I had to go to the bar to get a beer. The bartender gave me a bottle and a pint glass that still had two tablespoons of water left at the bottom.

Yeah.....no thanks."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. THE. PEPPERMILL. I try my best to come here every time I'm in Vegas. This institution has the biggest menu and serves the largest portions of everything you can ever imagine. I have tried their veggie omelette, cobb salad, bloody mary, and of course, THE SCORPION. Keep in mind, you should probably share your order unless if you're extremely hungover then I get it. The Scorpion was intimidating when we saw other tables drinking it but then we ended up loving it. It's dangerously tasty! Order it and share with a friend! You come here for the ambiance, the decor, and the ridiculously large portions. It's Las Vegas perfection."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the most memorable places in Vegas for anyone that's been here for a few decades, or anyone that's a tourist that wants a good taste of what some people refer to as old Vegas.  The place hasn't changed in 30+ years, and still serves a gigantic Scorpion drink that is a favorite of many.  My most recent visit there included some appetizers, which were tasty and well presented.  Wait staff was attentive, friendly, and well versed in what they have for specials and menu selections.  I'm not a frequent patron, but this is one of my favorite places to take friends or family when they are visiting Vegas.  I have never been disappointed here!"}
{"text":"No frills, cost-friendly diner located off the strip, just down the street from the Westgate Hotel. I had some time before a business meeting at the Westgate and wanted to go for a walk and get some quick lunch. This was just what I was looking for: decent food, quick service, relatively cheap."}
{"text":"Great bloody Marys and they serve you a lot of food.

Had the chicken fried steak and eggs plus hash browns. Toast of your choice included.

The chicken fried steak was really good, huge portion of steak covered in a nice coat of gravy and breading.

Hash browns were nicely diced and the eggs were okay.

Service is attentive and polite. Seating is a bit tight but they do offer tables, I'm a big guy so its not chubby approved to me... Just saying.

Plenty of parking and for the price its outstanding taste and value. Give it a half hour to sit though, you can kill time in their lounge while sipping on a drink and having their peanuts."}
{"text":"Upon walking up to, and into, this place, it was not what I expected.  I think I was expecting a steakhouse type of atmosphere, but it's more of a neon diner type of place.  It's technically on the strip, but definitely getting towards the sketchy end.  If you're looking for the \"old Vegas\" feel, definitely check this place out.  Once I kind of got past that, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  And the nachos are out of this world. Service was - like everywhere I go in Vegas - excellent.

Cheers! and get the nachos with ground beef on the side - trust me !"}
{"text":"My 7th time in Vegas, 1st time here.  You NEED to check it out.  Get a Bloody Mary and wait by fire pit until your table is ready.  Huge portions, good comfort food.  People that complain that it's expensive (which it's not) are best advised to hit the nearby Denny's."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in LV! 

I can't wait to get another one of those Bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 eggs sunny side up medium (fully cooked whites), 2 pieces of bacon, 2 biscuits with gravy and rye toast.
I got 3 eggs (cooked perfectly), 4 bacon, 4 biscuits and rye toast. 
All were priced at the full side order price.

Unless you want to pay the extra, stick to the selections as listed on the menu.

Still, very good food (though the gravy was a bit bland for me)."}
{"text":"This place is top notch. Such good food at reasonable prices. You seriously get nice portions. Even huge for some things, like pancakes. There can be a wait so you must be patient. It's totally worth it. Breakfast. Lunch. Dinner. Anything. Anytime. Servers are very accommodating. We never miss a stop here when in Vegas. The sandwich selections are my favorites. My husband prefers breakfast. Only thing he didn't like was the tostada omlette? I think that's what it's called."}
{"text":"I just sat down to write this review and over to the right is a review by our own Yelp Ambassador, Hazel Q.  She opens with a line that really describes it perfectly.

\"If you wanna feel like Sharon Stone in 'Casino' circa 1975, then put on that sparkly silver dress and get your ass to the Fireside Lounge.\"

Well, I did wanna feel like Sharon Stone in \"Casino\" and just so happened to be dawning my fanciest silver dress, so Peppermill seemed like the place to go.  Umm...maybe that was too much information...

This place is definitely a 70's disco hall converted into restaurant.  With neon pink lights and plenty of mirrors all around, you walk in wondering if you might be seeing some platforms and bell bottoms with the Bee Gees performing on a stage somewhere.  Unfortunately, there were none of those things to be found.  However, what they do have is pretty good food at very generous portions.

Unluckily for me, I was starting to become more and more hung over by the second by this point in the afternoon but I felt it would probably be a good idea to get something in my stomach.  Being 4:00 in the afternoon I decided that breakfast would probably be the best call so I ordered up what ended up being I gigantic plate of eggs, potatoes, sausage, and other vegetables.  I tried in vain to gobble this down but I was definitely feeling nauseous by this point.  Yet, despite my throbbing head and queasy stomach, I still thought that the breakfast was pretty damn good.  

I'll definitely be coming back here my next trip to Vegas.  Hopefully I'll be less hung over next time."}
{"text":"The service is great with a colorful atmosphere.  The New York steak was delicious and cooked as requested. They also give you a complimentary photo. Good portion of food. It was a little warm but it seems everyone was comfortable.  The place was busy but they kept up with everyone."}
{"text":"This place is open all night which you would think there would be a plethora of all night places to choose from in Vegas, but where they are I don't know.  Despite many trips to Vegas this was the first time I actually went in and had some food. I had forgotten there was also a location in Reno. It does always appear to be popular at all hours. I did find that all the bright colors and decorations did a lot to brighten my mood at 3am. I enjoyed some very large bloody mary's but despite the size they don't particulary stand out. This is a nice benefit over the all night places like this where I live, but I guess that's just a matter of state law. I was pretty happy with my bruschetta though, which is something that is not often on menus. My boyfriend enjoyed his food too, which I can no longer recall what it was, but I remember there was enough left over for us to share with the homeless man outside. It was a lively atmosphere and I will probably try it out again in the future. Good service even in the early morning."}
{"text":"I know everyone raves about this place and maybe it was just our server but I did not have a good experience here. We waited about 7 minutes for our server to show up. No greeting and no smile. We ordered drinks and she brought then in a couple minutes - that was fine - but my wife wasn't ready to order. \"Just give me another minute,\" says my wife. Well the sever took about 6 minutes to get back with us. Meanwhile the server for the neighboring tables had been back and forth four times.  Anyway we ordered and it was busy so we were patient. But meanwhile while waiting for our food another couple were seated near us being served by the other waitress. They got drinks, ordered and got their food 10 minutes before we did."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last weekend and only ordered the turkey burger, but it was the best turkey burger ever!!

Service is great and the neon lighting made me feel like i was in an 80's movie with Molly Ringwald or something. The server's purple power spandex outfits looked like something straight out of Rainbow Brite and the outfits changed to formal evening gowns for the later shift. Pretty cool.

Nonetheless, i will return someday and try more food because i'm sure it will be awesome.

Forget Denny's... Peppermill is where it's at!!!"}
{"text":"WOW...what can you say about the Peppermill that has not already been said.  
First it's been there for EVER.  The lounge is such a throw back to a different era.  Fire pits, surrounded by tropical looking plants.  Very Cool!!
The restaurant is ALWAYS crowded.  The portions are HUGE and they are open 24/7.  We had lunch and the sandwiches were so huge, that I only ate half and then had it boxed to go,  Which I gave to a homeless person.  Food was great...  They also have a person who takes pictures, which is so hokey.  But again a throw back....  
I would highly suggest this place, because it's almost a tourist attraction in it's self that most people don't know about!"}
{"text":"In Vegas bringing in 2018 and stopped by The Peppermill Diner. The line was out the door with a 30-45 minute wait. Put my name on the list and asked about service in the lounge. The lounge was only appetizers and drinks. I decided to wait since I'm in the mood for breakfast. We waited and I notice 2 seats available at the counter. Sat down and was waited on right away by Maribel. She was very attentive and the food came out quickly. 

The diner has not changed since my last visit 2 years ago when I celebrated Christmas in Vegas. The portions are large. I could have shared the omelette as it is that huge. The salad was ok. The lettuce tasted old. The home fries were good. The prices are less than the hotel breakfast but this is Vegas. The bill was $33.77. 

I will definitely return on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food great value. I go here every time I visit Vegas. We love it. The fire pits in the lounge are fun too. One of my favorite places hands down"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out while in Vegas (thanks to fellow Yelpers). Walked in around 12:30pm and there was already a 50 minute wait. Luckily my husband and I grabbed  a few empty seats at the diner bar (first come first serve for the bar). The vibe is definitely retro, neon, funky and old school! Something kinda cool about it!  But hey you are in Vegas so anything goes. Can't get over the waitresses in  80's prom dresses..lol..                                     Food was quick to come out after we placed our order. Portions are very large so my husband and I shared the Country Chicken Friend steak and eggs and a side of French Toast. Food was delicious and cheap. Definitely would  recommend !!"}
{"text":"Dear Peppermill,

Your staff and your food are worthless, lazy, expensive and just plain mediocre.  I'm so sick of the staff treating me like a worthless piece of crap, so I'm through with you.  I'm tired of paying 40-50 bucks for a meal where I have to practically beg for someone to refill my iced tea and get snubbed the entire night.

We used to be a great team. I'd stumble in drunk, eat your huge greasy food portions, and then get even more drunk off your overpriced scorpions.  Later you stopped caring about me by always overcooking every meal and then you eventually stopped using seasoning.  Finally, your staff just stopped paying attention to me. 

I just feel like you've given up on me, so last night I refused to tip your waitress after being blatantly ignored all evening and having our food shoved in our face which was so bad that I wanted to throw it back at you.  I'm leaving you because you don't contribute anything anymore and you make me hate you.

Good luck, Peppermill, although I know you don't need it.  There are plenty of other tourists, strippers, crackheads, and those down on their luck that you can take advantage of!"}
{"text":"This review is for the lounge only as we'd already had dinner and came here for the dive bar ambiance and drinks.

From what I could tell, the lounge is to the left, restaurant to the right. Inside the lounge/bar area, it's dimly lit with couches sprawled around all over, and small fires burning in central areas (usually with couches encircling them). As most of the fire areas were occupied, we found a small section and sat down. The menu had an interesting list of drinks and we each picked out something when the waitress came by to take our order. I chose a weird \"cream cheese icing\" drink just for the hell of it.

Our drinks came out and I was presented with a martini glass rimmed with graham cracker crumbs and this eye-crossingly sweet icing flavoured drink. Seriously, if you're not a fan of sweet drinks, don't get this. I love sweet drinks and it was delicious but it pretty much made me done with drinking afterwards! 

We had a small incident that resulted in my drink on the floor (and on my pants) and the waitress who saw it came over and cleaned it up, while we apologized and asked for a second one to replace it. She brought it over and even though the spill was our fault and we expected to pay for it, she never charged us for it! Hooray! (we did leave an appropriate tip to show our gratitude!)

The bar itself isn't too loud and rowdy (we were there between 11:30 pm and 12:30 am, give or take). TVs scattered around up on ceiling were playing videos of live performances of a range of music, mostly 70s and 80s rock, which was pretty neat to watch.

Sadly, we didn't stay, just long enough for the one drink. As we had just flown in that day, we both had a sudden crash and wanted to just to find our hotel and rest up. We had planned on staying for a few rounds of drinks but unfortunately did cut it short. This place is on our list to return to though next time we're in the area, as the dive bar atmosphere was pretty awesome and the service was top."}
{"text":"Where do I want to go to breakfast when I'm in Vegas? Does that question even need to be asked?

I've never, ever had a bad experience there, in the many times I've been there over the past 15 years. It's amazing how little the place changes - maybe the management could update the waitstaff's cocktail-waitress-type attire from the Hawaiian nightmare it is now (and always has been), but that's about it. Service is sometimes slower when they get slammed (and they do get very slammed at times) but since I rarely get to bed before 2am when in Vegas, the crowd has usually dissipated by the time I roll in for breakfast at 11ish.

I've almost always been greeted warmly by the waitstaff (although they usually don't know me from Adam until my second or third consecutive morning in), the portions are so huge I can't finish my ham and eggs (and I can eat a LOT of ham) and the eggs benedict is one of the best I've had anywhere. Prices are reasonable, and the coffee cups are large. (Tip: go easy on the sparkly colored sugar in your coffee - the stuff is even sweeter than \"Sugar in the Raw.\")

The only other place in Vegas that I'd even consider recommending for breakfast in LV is the Grand Lux at the Venetian, but that's like being the second best golfer to Tiger Woods. 

And I do admit I've never been in the lounge, but I hear it's awesome as well."}
{"text":"Ok so i have never been in the dinning area. I have always gone to the lounge to drink with friends and if i were to give the loung a review on its own i would give more stars.  But how ever the service in the dinning sucks i gave it 3 the waitress was fine but having to wait on a different waitress for drink orders is dumb! And the fact she NEVER came makes it worse. It also said vegetarians go nuts for this place. Well i noticed the breakfast the only thing vegetarians could order beside the caprese sandwich. Now the food is pretty damn good tho just sicks service was so crappy."}
{"text":"While in Vegas last week, my husband and I stumbled upon this cool spot. I wanted to see the \"old\" part of the strip. We were walking down the strip, starving, and happened to see it. My husband pulled it up on his phone, and saw the excellent reviews, so we went in. It was busy, and there was a wait, so we went into the fireside lounge. What a cool, hip, old-school Vegas setting! The Bloody Mary was the best I have ever tasted (I normally don't like them, but this one was awesome). The reviews that my husband  saw suggested ordering one, so we did (and two more). The food was amazing with enormous portions, so beware. For Vegas, the prices are reasonable, and we had excellent service in both the bar and restaurant. We will make it a point to go back to this place on our future trips to Vegas. The only negative is that it is down next to the Riviera, and walking in that area is a little shady. I wouldn't walk down there late at night; take a cab."}
{"text":"There's usually a wait for table, but I sat immediately at the bar. Service is good. The menu is pretty large and it's 24hours. The food was served quickly and there's sufficient staff (seemed to me). 

I got the French toast collage, which is French toast, eggs, and bacon/sausage. The toast was made well...everything is a bit greasy but that's expected. 

Prices are higher than Denny's, but it's the experience of a neon lit restaurant that makes it worthwhile."}
{"text":"this place has become a regular stop for my boyfriend and i while in vegas. 

the atmosphere is funky and retro and the food is basic and delicious. they have a huge menu but i always get the biscuits and gravy and am never dissapointed! my boyfriend got the..italian omlette of some sort..i forget the name but it was covered in marinara sauce and it was so so yummy. 

oh and the bloody marys are pretty damn good too!!"}
{"text":"Great diner place.. I normally don't like diner foods but omg.. this place have awesome food.  I wanted to give them 5 stars but took 1 star out because waitress could have been little more friendly. She wasn't rude or anything but no smile and looked to be exhausted."}
{"text":"A long line for a table but Peppermill turns around their tables pretty quick. I think they average a 15-20 minutes wait time when they are busy. 

The food is decent. This place is opened 24/7 which is perfect for anytime of the day. We came in for breakfast after our B2V race and didn't have to wait too long for a table for the 6 of us. 

The breakfast was decent. Everyone enjoyed their breakfast and mimosas. I got the corned beef which had to be canned. The corned beef was actually too salty. Overall the service was decent as well. 

Good for breakfast or an American (Denny's type of meal)."}
{"text":"I love that this place is 24 hours and every close to the Strip. My friends and I always tend to come here after those clubbing nights. The food just tops off the night! French fries and mushroom burger...YUM! The service is pretty good also, so if you're looking for a decent place (with decent prices) in those wee hours, Peppermill's is your place.

The theme in there is so tropical...with the flamingos, silk trees, and waiters/waitresses with Hawaiian shirts and dresses on..."}
{"text":"Wow! Just like its twin in Reno, the Peppermill's Fireside Lounge in Las Vegas is Heaven on Earth!  WOW! What AMAZING, \"old school\" customer service!!!!!!! Two thumbs WAY up to James, Marilena, Alyce, Brigitte, Ruthie and Diana!!!!!!! You guys treated us like we were whales!  Please Mr. Peppermill: Give them all a big, fat raise! They more than deserve it!  Oh and by the way, we'll be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5... 

Came here for brunch around 1030a and the line was out the door! We waited about 20 mins for a table.

Ambiance was weird... It was pimped out!!! HAHAHA There are actually trees (fake) inside the restaurant, comfy booths and a diner bar.

Our server, Kathleen, was excellent-and from what I overheard-she has been there for years.

We ordered: 
-Coffees ($3): Big cups and French Vanilla creamer. Always topped off.
-Garden Omelet [custom] ($13)
-Lorraine Omelet ($13.20)
Total was $40 with tip.

Portions were very generous, and came with a couple sides. I opted for the hash browns and English muffin. I couldn't finish half my entree and I was hungry! Hash browns had a little burnt taste to it, but no biggie - I stuck to my veggie omelet.

There's ample FREE parking in the back, which is convenient given LV. Would recommend coming here at least once. Big ups for it being 24 hours!"}
{"text":"(read the following review to the tune of bobby brown's \"every little step\")

i can't sleep at night, i toss and turn
dreamin' about the peppermill
but i get a crave so i'm all choked up
can't believe i need another fill
and as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
how delicious your dessert drinks can be
because the drinks you do is a dream come true
a real life fantasy

no matter where i am in vegas
i've found a great place to love
and we will be together, drinking grasshoppers forever
it's like that, it's like that

every little vegas trip i take
i will go there
every little vegas trip i make
i'll be at the peppermill yeah.....

the peppermill brings tacky-chic to a whole new level. first of all, don't tell me you don't love plastic foliage, red and blue neon lights, AND fire shooting out of the middle of a watery pit. i sure as hell can't get enough of this place and i don't say this because i'm intoxicated. i say this out of pure, on bended knees kind of love. try their \"grasshopper,\" an alcoholic mint milk shake that flows smoothly through your straw, and i swear, YOU will be as smitten as i am. happy drinking folks! you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great place to take out of towners who are looking for a real old school Las Vegas Chill spot. They have a cool looking bar."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, you get what you pay for. The portions are also generous--they are HUGE! Especially for a banana split...I thought it would be a typical size you get at a ice cream store. But, not here. It was bigger than my hand. (Check out photos) It was a colorful atmosphere, full of flowers, neon lights, blue colors, kind of retro. Service kind of sucked--didn't come by to check up, and all of our waters needed to be refilled badly. 

One of the waitresses was walking around asking tables if they wanted a FREE picture. Well, always remember that nothing in life is free! Our table said sure, took our picture, came back with the print out (looked really good) said it was $15 individual, or $10 each for two. Umm...no thanks! 

Other than that sketchy picture scam, food was yummy, you will leave feeling stuffed to the max. My advice is to SHARE! (Shared a hamburger with fries with my bf, and both of us were full of only half a hamburger) The banana split literally needs 4+ people to help finish it all."}
{"text":"Aww.....The Peppermill.....

I really do love this place! I love the whole cheesy, neon night club atmosphere thing going on, I love the big over portioned drinks as well as food and I love the fact that it brings back so many fond memories of the days in Vegas and also memories of other Peppermills I have visited over the years.

I came here recently for breakfast on my little Vegas getaway and immediately felt a comforting sensation as I entered in through the doors. I was immediate greeted by an exceptionally friendly hostess and seated promptly.

I ordered a sausage, Swiss cheese and onion omelet, which came with has browns and a blueberry muffin.

As always, the peppermill way, my omelet was GYNORMOUSE and mouthwatering delicious and even the hash browns were quite tasty especially considering the fact that I'm not into hash browns.

The bar area is fantabulous!!! Dark secluded and intimate with a big fiery pit centered in the middle surrounded by an engaging lounge couch area. It  definitely is something worth checking out! You haven't fully experienced Vegas to the fullest with out stopping here; really, you just have to make this a destination point!! Can't wait tell my next visit!!!"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a guilty pleasure as is the adjoining Fireside lounge. This is a great last stop of the night because it is so over the top, datedly bad, that it transcends into amazing. 

 You will not crave the food here, but it will not disappoint you either. The portions are HUGE as are the drinks and the scene inside is like Starsky ditched Hutch and went into business with Huggy Bear....in 1987."}
{"text":"Very cool spot! Friendly staff. Looks like a night club in the restaurant. The food comes in pretty large portions for a great price and it's really good. It's possible that you could run into a celebrity here! Me and a friend ran into flavor flav which was pretty cool lol Definitely worth checking out :)"}
{"text":"What a fun, eclectic place. Food was decent, drinks strong, desserts huge. All with a shaker of multicolored sugar and just waiting to see if one of your 80s idols will make a random appearance given the decor. What more can you need for a Vegas meal?"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite steak & eggs for breakfast in Las Vegas... I've driven by Peppermill countless times in the many years since I have been coming to Las Vegas but I hadnt tried it until a couple years back. I had asked my friend Judith who is a local and worked in the tourism industry what was her favorite steak & eggs. She immediately said Peppermill... So after landing in Vegas on the first flight out of Burbank we headed for the boulevard and some grub. 

The wait is long. It was Saturday morning and we waited about 45 mins for our table of 2. It was also Halloween weekend so that might be another reason for the crowd. We were starved by the time we were seated. There is a bar off to the side of the hostess station inside that they direct you to while you wait. Or there is a waiting room up front or people wait right outside the door. The parking lot is huge and it needs to be as they get super busy.

My NY steak and eggs was great. ($18.95) I had asked for scrambled eggs and hash browns along with my thick cut NY steak. It was cooked a perfect medium and i scarfed it up with the quickness. It was a tasty steak breakfast. The hashbrowns and eggs were good too. It comes with toast as well.

Service was friendly. They have a big menu but I didnt need to ponder much on what to order. Steak & eggs all the way for me. The decor inside the Peppermill reflects that of the neon side outside. It's like Tropicana loud. haha... You will see. That was great meal we had."}
{"text":"Biggest baddest breakfast on the Strip. Don't come here if your not hungry. Great old school Vegas vibe."}
{"text":"I call this place mediocre. Nothing on the menu to really excite me and keep me coming back. Food is okay -- just okay. Pricing a bit high -- not a good bang for the buck. Service varies a lot. This place consistently gets a lot of variable press. I don't know why. Just not my cup of tea. And I find the bar boring with inflated drink prices."}
{"text":"This stand alone restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip is serving some of the best breakfast food I've ever tasted.  The omelette's are unbelievably delicious and huge.  The western fruit plate is big enough to feed the entire table.  My favorite breakfast is a tie between the Masserati omelette and Joe's San Francisco Breakfast Special.  The  Pork Sliders are also perfect and so are the huge Bloody Marys.  

If you have to wait for a table (and even if you don't), you should have a pre-meal Bloody Mary or Mimosa in the Fireside Lounge.   

The service is great and everyone is very friendly.  This is my favorite breakfast restaurant in Vegas.  Also my favorite breakfast Bloody Mary and Mimosa (fresh squeezed orange juice)."}
{"text":"This is place is a local  treasure!  This is a place that is done a true Vegas style!  

The lounge is swanky-tacky...  The sunken fireplace water thing practically hypnotized me as I gazed at it! 

The restaurant part is slightly better than normal diner food.  The portions were large.

Yes - 5 stars!  This is a one of kind original!"}
{"text":"This place is a legend. If you are in Vegas you just have to go there for breakfast. The quality is exceptional and the portions are Huge. I have been there a dozen times, and never once have I had anything but the best of service and the finest breakfast"}
{"text":"This Vegas diner is an institution.   This diner is a throwback to old Vegas.  This diner and the attached lounge look more strip club than diner but it is super fun. 

The portions are HUGE.  The servers are awesome and very friendly.  The short skirts and evening gowns sure don't hurt either. :)  The menu is huge and varied.    

I have eaten here a few times and have ordered breakfast,  a burger, a sandwich, and entrees.  All of the food has been properly prepared.  All of the food has been a seven or better.   

You really can't go wrong eating here because the food is good, the service is good, the place is fun/funky.  It is a little pricey but being on the strip, and a touristy place it is to be expected.   Go!"}
{"text":"We came from LA and went to this place for breakfast. The décor was really cool to see with the mirrors and  neon lights. The portions were huge but I split the country fried steak with my boyfriend 2/3 and 1/3. It was delicious. But a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great waitstaff! This place is always packed and serves breakfast lunch and dinner 24/7. Jo Anne was great, not very often do you have the manager working this hard and waiting on the customers. The rest of the staff were all very friendly and working non-stop"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a must see when in Vegas. Its like a strip club with no poles and average looking waitresses in floor length identical dresses. There are no windows in the lounge area and plush magenta fabric on anything that is nailed down, accented by rope lights in various colors. The fire pit is cool to look at but drinking and sitting by a fire is no picnic. Gets all hot and uncomfotable. Plus the tv's all over playing weird random videos is always fun. I recommend the scorpian. Its huge with like 8 different shots but tastes like fruit punch! Or the grasshopper, its like a blended thin mint mmmm....

Great appetizers too! And the restaurant has a full menu 24 hrs!!! Beware though, their portions are outta control huge, but for sure the best breakfast ever! I go every time I go to Vegas and will continue to do so!

If you have not been you need to GO GO GO!!!"}
{"text":"Before I get into the food, the atmosphere is the first thing that catches your eye obviously. It's set up like a cross between a 50's diner and a casino lounge. The waitresses are dressed the part, too. 

My wife and I got there on a Monday morning around 10 and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a booth. And the food... restaurants always claim to have \"huge portions.\" This place lives up to reputation. I ordered a veggie omelet, and was worried it wouldn't be enough food so I added cheese and also planned on splitting my wife's side of Canadian bacon. But then the food arrived. The omelet was enormous. I asked the waitress how many eggs, because most places make their omelets with three eggs. No, Peppermill makes theirs with ten. Yes, ten eggs. And it wasn't just a ridiculous quantity; the quality was good, too. 


Another bonus is the wife and I were both able to sub fruit instead of potatoes at no charge. And while the side of fruit wasn't nearly as big as the enormously sized fruit plate, it was still a lot. And freshly cut. Lastly, as if to cement the meal as great even more, my wife's eggs were perfectly poached to her liking. When we come back to Vegas, we will definitely go out of our way to stop here a"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and this place is awesome! My group didnt order anything else, we had the omelette.  That IN ITSELF is amazing!

Ho ho ho!  I dont think they make more creative and tasty omelettes.  Forget the IHOP, DENNY'S OR HOTEL OMELETTES! This place has out of the world, big and tasty omelttes.  My group had mediaterranean, veggie and this meat sauce one.  All tasty, good, blended well.

Food here is tasty... and slightly pricy, but worth the while.  Great ambiance too!"}
{"text":"Peppermill is by far my favorite diner in the world!! Maybe it's because it was featured in both my favorite movies. ..showgirls and casino.  But I love it here. The breakfast is amazing. Best hash brown ever!!! The food is so tasty, the price is great. The service is wonderful!  The decorations is just vintage vegas. I love every Lil thing about this place. From the clown sugar to the blue uniforms the waitress wear. I pray to God this place never closes. It's the real deal vintage vegas."}
{"text":"Stuck in time. Food is pretty good. Muffins are awesome. Good place for tourist.  Locals, not so much. Too many other great options in this city"}
{"text":"Just an oversize Denny's with wonderful food and oversized portions. 

Everything from breakfast food through steaks and wonderful soup. I just had the split pea and ham soup and it was out of this world"}
{"text":"10 egg omelettes
massive bloody marys
fantasia waffle heaped with tons of fruit
cheesy 80s look and feel

Whatelse could you ask for?
This place is classic vegas and amongst the best places for breakfast in Vegas. I loved coming here. A definite must for all to check out."}
{"text":"Late to the game again.  I've lived in Vegas since 1992 and just recently made my first visit to this spot that's a favorite with visitors and locals.  It looks like some kinda Miami Vice-inspired disco with all the purple and pink neon inside, but it also has waitresses who wear blue and white old-school uniforms and call you \"honey.\"  The menu has something for everyone, which is a good thing since it's open 24/7 and you never know what you'll be craving in the wee hours.  
The first visit, I had an omelet which, upon ordering, I had no idea would be made with 10 whole eggs!  No wonder I couldn't even finish half.  The second visit the other day, I ordered the turkey club with fries and that was also a healthy portion, but I was able to finish most of it in one sitting.  There was some kind of mishap in the kitchen, though, with my dish taking the longest to arrive.  Our waitress was very good about getting the sandwich comped because of the delay and the head chef also came by our table to apologize.   
Depending on the time of day you come, there will be a wait, so be prepared since this is a popular place.  We ate lunch here two days ago on Friday, November 11th, at 12:30pm, and waited about 30 minutes.  Mind you, it was a holiday, so considering that, the line wasn't horrible. 
If you have room left, get an ice cream sundae.  We got the hot fudge and demolished it."}
{"text":"A definite stop while on Vegas! Make sure you go hungry, portions are large. Big enough to share. Very friendly waitresses. We sat at the counter and got a good look at everything going out. Everything looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Great diner on the strip. I went there last month. The food was good. The portions were large. It is very vegas-esque with the mirrored ceilings, bright neon lights, and even a photographer coming to the table to take our picture (for sale). The service was slow but it was still a good spot for some \"upgraded\" diner food after a night of drinking on the strip at 3am."}
{"text":"We wandered out of the glaring sunlight and retreated to the cavernous wonder that is the Fireside Lounge.  This is the home of fire leaping up out of bubbling water that gently cycles through the color spectrum, surrounded by plush purple couches, and music videos of live performances that span the generations (The Beach Boys, Paul Simon, Aretha, Hall and Oats, Coldplay, you get the idea).  There is plastic bougainvillea everywhere, creating little oases of privacy, despite the mirrored ceilings.  Purple, pink, and turquoise lights add to the \"ambiance.\"  Nothing about this place is real.  It's Vegas, after all.  Get out of the hot Vegas sun and soak up some fireside kitsch.  This is the Vegas your parents remember.  And it's awesome."}
{"text":"What a gem on the strip!  After a failed trip to Tacos El Gordo for a quick bite before we left town Monday morning, we decided to hop over here.

The decor is...funktastic, like a 1970's disco party.  You were definitely transported back in time, like the menu says, to how Vegas used to be.  

Even on a Monday morning, business was good.  Thankfully, there was no wait for us because we were both famished and in a hurry to get on the road.

Puzzle:  A sexy cocktail server takes your alcoholic beverage order while a more normal one (still cute, just showing less cleavage) takes your food and juice orders.  Everything ends up on the same bill anyway.  Just thought that was kind of odd. 

Food:  Pretty yummy.  Breakfast portions were generous except hubby's NY Steak and eggs was normal sized.  I got corned beef hash and eggs and realized I didn't get any hash browns with it.  However, I noodled it over and reasoned that the corned beef already had potatoes in it.  Just so used to other places giving you a side of hash browns, this sort of made sense.  
My dish was pretty greasy...rather than a patty of corned beef hash, it was bowl of mushy stuff, sitting in a lot of butter.  I did enjoy my breakfast but it got pretty salty and I tried to avoid the parts sitting butter.  Hubby said his steak was ok and eggs were well cooked.

Cool stuff:  Sugar dispenser contained multi-colored crystals which resembled those tube-like beads you used to make jewelry.  I could resist taking a teaspoonful and eating it like a kid.  Downside:  The dispenser had some crusty old gunk on it so it was a little gross to handle.

Service was very friendly and on-par.  Definitely a place to consider if you're nearby and want some good breakfast grub."}
{"text":"I always love this place when in Las Vegas. I order a drink  (Grey Goose to be exact) and got cheap vodka instead. The cocktail waitress did the best she could, but I knew it was the stupid bartender. Gave her a rip anyway for trying to make it right. The door is always amazing, no matter what I order."}
{"text":"Joe's San Francisco Special @ Peppermill Las Vegas. Scrambled Eggs, Spinach, Sausage, Ground Beef, Onion, over Hash Browns, and topped with Cheese Sauce. Heard about Peppermill from a few different sources and it definitely lives up to the hype. It's super old school Vegas feel and you get the best bang for your buck. This scramble was very good and it came with a Bran Muffin. Huge portion and it was only $13.75. The place was packed and I could see why. Great food, large portions, attentive service, cool decor, and great value. This is a must when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Throwback Central! Loved this place. My club sandwich was fresh and yummy. My wife loved her Reuben. And we would both hide a body for those fries. Totally recommend this nostalgic Vegas joint."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it!  We came for brunch but there was about a 15-30 min wait but we were able to sit in the lounge and get mimosas while we waited so the wait didn't really feel like a wait at all.  I was keeping my expectations low as places that are kitschy typical fail in all other aspect but I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was good and the service was great.  I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"How does this place have a 4 star average? Everything at this restaurant was subpar. The service was all business and barely with a smile. Coffee was disgusting - couldn't even drink it. And even after telling our server we were still charged for coffee we couldn't drink. Bloody Mary was like tomato flavored water. For entrées we got the French toast and munch's. both were just ok. They get two stars for ambiance and a clean restaurant"}
{"text":"Was a bit of a walk from my hotel and had a 50min wait. But it was worth it. Great service and the food was delish. Big portions so i would share. Sarah our waitress was fantastic. I would definitely recommend to visitors."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. Mix of clientele that made it interesting. I got the steak and mushroom salad. It was delicious. Our waitress was sweet and very good. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wait - Really long in the morning. Expect an hour.

Food - Really good diner-style food

Price - Cheap ($10-$15 food per person, with two mimosa our bill was $44)

Staff - Not the friendliest, but they are overly swamped with people because it's such a popular place so it's very understandable. If you want that friendly experience with waitstaff that is going to be at your beckon call, this place is too busy for you."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience! We put our name on the list and the wait was about 50 minutes so we decided to go to one of the nearby hotels and hangout. Sure enough when we came back we were next to be called awesome timing. We got seated and started looking over the menu. I ordered the eggs Benedict. Huge portion and it tasted wonderful. How did I never try this place? The decor looks like an old hotel with all the neon lights but the customer service was super friendly and fast even with it being so busy. The prices are average I wouldn't say it's expensive especially with the size portions that you get. I will deff be back thanks again peppermill!"}
{"text":"Came here around 12:30am V-Day.  It was a little busy but nothing out of control and a few people waiting in the tiny \"lobby\".

Once we were seated it took AT LEAST 10min before our server WENDY came over to our table. How do you walk up to the customers who will be tipping you with sooo much attitude??! She asked what we wanted to drink, water and lemonade. We ordered the food while she was still standing there so we wouldn't have to wait again (which for some reason pissed her off to the point she felt the need to talk down to us). We told her what we wanted to her and she responded with, \"Yea, yea I got it..see I wrote it down. What else?\" Rude!

The lemonade never came out, so the bf waved down the next available sever. Our waitress came over within minutes to say, \"Soo..You ordered lemonade?\" We nod. She said, \"You ordered it from me?\". We nod again, and my bf told her she wrote it down. Instead of apologizing she rolls her eyes, walks away and someone else ended up bringing our drinks.

I ordered the tostada omlet and the bf ordered the hamburger. It didn't take long for the food to get out, buuut I'm not sure why tables seated waay after us got thier food first?? (Maybe I'm being too picky??) 

The food was just okay. Nothing I would ever come back or crave again. The hashbrowns were burnt on the outside and straight mush on the inside. Disgusting. I barely touched them. And OF COURSE she forgot to bring my side of toast.. whatever. I was already pissed off. Bf said his burger wasn't bad, but not worth the price. It came with fries but our shit server never gave us the option of onion rings, sweet potato fries etc. 

She also thought it was okay to keep bending over so everyone could see her underwear up her skirt. Seriously?? GTFO. 

Overall..
This will have to be the last restaurant on earth for me to return. Shitty ass servers, boring food, poor management and waaay over priced for what you get. I wish we would have just went to chinatown LOL!! 

I wanted to take a picture but my phone died ): 

Don't go here! You'll regret it. Run the other way faaaast!"}
{"text":"I went here after work with some friends because I heard it was a place you have to go if you live in Vegas. I honestly don't know why the hype is about because the food was okay, nothing special. I would say it's a good place to eat after a night of drinking with your standard diner food. They have a person that comes around and takes a souvenir picture and cocktail waitress. I'm not one to send stuff back but I ordered a Mai Thai and had to send it back because it was not a Mai Thai. I had some of my friends try it and it just tasted like tap water. We also ordered a fudge brownie that was literally all chocolate syrup and one small piece of brownie. The ambiance is pretty cool, it's bright and has an old diner feel. I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"This place is so fantastically representative of gaudy Las Vegas!!!  I am so so so glad my husband shared this gem with me.  We went there on 2/25/12, sometime around noon-ish.  The decor is this strange mix of neon lights and faux exotic plant life (think blooming cherry trees and birds of paradise).  And the Fireside Lounge is too awesome for words.  We put our name in for a table, then went to the properly dark & swanky lounge to enjoy a couple Bloody Mary's.  It was the perfect place to zone out while sipping our tasty beverages as we continued to wake up from our very late night playing poker at Bill's Gamblin' Hall.  Once we got seated, I ordered the Feta & Vegetable Omelette.  It was scrumptious!!  It had spinach, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, and provolone cheese on the inside, with crumble feta and tomatoes sprinkled on top.  The portion was easily large enough to serve two people and I could only eat half of it (that's a bummer, as I don't like wasting food).  PLUS, that half omelette with its usual breakfast sides were so filling that I just had a Nathan's hot dog later and was good for the rest of the night.  The service was also great, with our friendly and helpful server Jennifer.  Please do yourself a favor and have breakfast here at least once the next time you visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I remember going to the Peppermill before it was cool. The orange sugar is the best invention ever! 

But now the sugar is all rainbow colored. And they remodeled the inside so it's all pink and purple neon and cheesy Vegas. The portions of most things are preggy big. The food isn't great, but it is pretty good, the portions are big, and it's kind of cheap. 

Now the Peppermill is a throwback? Damn, I'm not that old. But anyway, this place really gives that good ole cheesy Vegas vibe. The firepit and large drinks make this a good place to bring a date, if you know what I mean... What? No! I meant because drinking all that ice cold soda will make you cold and you need the fire to keep you warm..."}
{"text":"BEST place for amazing food at a great price. Super cute lounge in the back. I have gone here twice with my boyfriend and we were OVERLY pleased. open 24 hours and off the strip right by the Riveria, great food and great prices. I visit this place EVERY vegas trip after being hungover :)"}
{"text":"Its right next to Denny's so Im Just sayin...if you want better diner food come here to.... Get a order of Chicken Nachos and a beer  to stop that hangover chief."}
{"text":"I love scenery! The location is nice and comfortable. The food is a little bland but the drinks are great. The menus didn't seem to have The sour Midoris are fabulous ! The staff is friendly. The booths are a little snug. Overall not a bad place."}
{"text":"So...came to this joint per recommendation of Holly Madison's Twitter feed...Unfortunately she wasn't there the time I showed up. Ha! BUT I have to say I was really surprised by this place. Such a funky, cool Vegas spot. Yes all the other reviews are right. Very Kitsch and lots of neon and mirrors and the fireplace in the middle of the restaurant is pretty cool. TIP: when you walk in you have to go to the bar/lounge area to the left for this stuff. There is a main eating room/diner area to the right when you walk in. GO LEFT to the lounge. You can still get great diner food and big drinks in there.  I did feel like the place could have been a strip club at some point. I kept looking to see if there was some remnant of a stripper pole in there somewhere but couldn't find it. Never researched the history on this joint so who knows? Anyway, I love finding weird fun and funky spots outside of \"The Strip\" and this one definitely one to visit."}
{"text":"Cheap frozen food  .. Salads drenched or no dressing at all Portions are Humongous ... After I ordered the Peppermill Sampler Huge Onion rings gross frozen chicken tenders and shrimp and Mozzerela sticks.  My friend got the Chicken Parmasean and sent it back my other friend got the chicken Caesar salad and it was gross as well.  I ordered a Bloody Mary I love Bloody Marys but theirs is Horrid Grey Goose or not."}
{"text":"One thing you need in Vegas is a 24 hour dining option. And if you're on the Strip, Peppermill is a phenomenal option. There's two sides to the place.  One is the Fireside Lounge, which has a wonderful 80s retro vibe to it, especially with the lighting.

The restaurant side is where I went, though.  The menu is pretty typical of a lot of the 24 hour diner options -- an expansive menu of appetizers, sandwiches, entrees, and breakfasts.  My French Dip was excellent especially with swiss cheese and mushrooms, both of which were extra.  The service was very typical of the Strip -- very attentive and a team of staff as opposed to one specific waiter.

By far, one of my favorite dining options and a rare remnant of the old school Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to eat in Vegas! The food is priced well and the food is delicious! I would have eaten here everyday if I'd known this place was here! My wife absolutely loves this place as well. Service was awesome which is s bonus!"}
{"text":"For our last meal before heading out of Las Vegas my co-worker and I wanted a steak...we walked over to Circus Circus excited and we were skunked for a 1 1/2 hour wait since we didn't make reservations.  Oh what to do?!!?  Yep, open up Yelp and let my taste buds do the walking.  

The closest place that wasn't fancy or didn't require a reservation was The Peppermill.  As we walked past the place (had to get to a crosswalk) it looked like a fun place to have dinner and the rest of you Yelpers had it at 4-stars...so we gave them a shot.  From the outside, the place didn't look like much more than a fancy NJ Diner...just with more neon.

When we got inside I realized the place was bigger than it seemed, but it STILL looked like a neon bathed NJ diner...so I was hoping for a good meal at a good price.  The menu here is pretty large, but we were here for a couple of steaks...nothing too fancy, but something that would sit in my stomach for the 5+ hour flight home (what were we thinking?).  Ernesto came over and took our drink orders and was back quickly for the food orders.  We skipped the appetizers (though the meal did come with salad) and we ordered a couple of NY Strips...my buddy added a side of fettuccini alfredo and I stuck with my potato...and we both also got a side of cooked, marinated mushrooms.  We waited a bit for Ernesto to come back with our salads and I asked him 2x for water.  When the salads arrived a waitress named Gabby delivered them and I asked for more water (this time it took about 45 seconds).

Ok, I know what you're thinking...these idiots ordered steaks at what amounts to a fancy diner?!?!  Yep...don't judge a book by its cover.  My steak, though a little small, was actually quite delicious.  Cooked with just some salt and cracked pepper it was tasty and done just medium.  My co-worker had to send his back as his was still mooing, but it came back quickly and was more to his liking.  For some reason, Ernesto disappeared and we ended up with Gabby as our waitress.  Now, I'm not one to judge, but this being Vegas and all, I don't think this was the only job Gabby had...Gabby was very friendly, quite a beautiful young woman, and honestly a great waitress.  I hope she ended up taking the tip instead of Ernesto who did nothing more than take our order.

Gonna give The Peppermill 3.5 stars and have to round down.  The undercooked steak, the disappearing waiter, the multiple requests for water...the service could have been better (though it got better with Gabby)."}
{"text":"Always great, portions always huge, servers always knowledgeable and friendly. Been coming here for 30+ years and won't stop. Do yourself a favor and grab some breakfast here, you'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and food. Great service. Recommend the club and pancakes. Best spot on strip!"}
{"text":"I shared a few bites off a friend's breakfast plate and was happy I didn't order a meal. The waffle was dry and tasteless and the scrambled eggs tasted like they were powdered. The place was bizarre and looked like a neon park meets game show set. Our server was rude and didn't seem to want to be bothered-she literally snatched the menu out of my hand since I wasn't going to order a meal myself. The only thing I somewhat enjoyed here were the tall cups for coffee and that the sugar in the dispenser was multi-colored. Have a meal elsewhere. Not worth it for cruddy food and even worse service."}
{"text":"Looks sketchy on the outside, but the food is decent (huge portions).  Margaritas were sub par. Decor inside is cheesy but a treat!  We ate there as soon as we checked into our hotel, and again before we took off to the airport.

It's silly, but good."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Portion sizes where massive and really cheap,the tray of scrambled eggs I got never seemed to end. Will be returning next time I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is hilarious!  

We found it on Yelp (course) and were seriously surprised. LONG day of flights plus a workout in. We didn't want to get super decked out. Went literally from the fitness center in our hotel to Peppermill after walking down to the strip. We told the cab to take us here and he was cracking up.  We didn't get the joke till we arrived. 

Pretend and visualize you at a IHop/Denny's with ambiance lightening, dance music that serves alcohol. You have arrived at the Peppermill Lounge. LOL!!!! 

The food ROCKS here. Late that Saturday night we each had a mediterranean omelette with egg whites and hash browns.  Bran muffin for him, blueberry for me.  We barely said a word to each other. We just chowed! I kept eye balling these HUGE onion rings that were passing our table and said I HAD to go back at some point and get my onion rings.  It was a must-do. 

The next day for lunch we needed something sort of easy and quick. It was Sunday and we walked in around 1130 am to see a JAMMED room of people WAITING for tables to get in....I'm telling you, it's THAT good. We by-passed them and went to the Fireside Lounge side of the facility. We ordered a few cocktails a fruit/cheese plate, BIG bowl of Onion Rings as big as your head...and a plate of sliders. I didn't touch the fruit/cheese, overdosed on Onion Rings as planned and had a slider with maybe a few chips.  The food was again, awesome.  Next time I'm just getting those onion rings. :) 

We made fun of it yet went there TWICE.  We like our grub and it was worth going two times. Prices are more than fair and the staff is good."}
{"text":"This place is been a Vegas institution for those \"in the know\" and locals forever!

Stuck in the cool of the 80s with blue & pink neon,  pepper trees and 80s pop music playing low in the background. 

I promise you're going to have a great time and the food is way more than you expect when you order it!

More than enough on every plate to share, but so many good things to choose that you have to order more than you can eat.

Cocktails served by a glamorous Vegas beauty in a long black evening gown looking like a starlet from a Hollywood red carpet. Who could say no?

If you are staying at the North end of the strip this is the spot to end your night of drinking and gambling. 

If it goes back to value, this spot has value spade!

Thanks for reading my review."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. My party of 8 checked in, hostess told me the wait was 45min so we decided to hang out in the fireside lounge. The inside looks like a limo/ party bus... appropriate for Vegas. Cocktail waitresses were friendly; drinks didn't taste like there was any alcohol tho. 
One star for unique atmosphere. 

After an hour, I approached the hostess about how much longer & she said \"We're just waiting for tables to get up\" & no apology, which pissed me off. If I've waited way past the amount of time you told me I needed to wait, at least take 2 seconds out of the time your getting paid to stand there to apologize for your hosting skills. 

Literally 1hr & 30 min later , 2x my quote time, we finally get sat! Then, we had to wait some more because it took 3 different people to get our meal started: 1 for basic drinks, 2nd for alcoholic drinks, 3rd for food. We kept hearing \"someone else will get that for you\", WTF. Then we happened to notice that another large party that sat after us got their food faster than us. We're angrier than hangry at this point! 

The food: .. we ate it. Similar to Denny's. Second star for George (our server) for doing your job. 

Paying out: Two people of my party had to leave early so they tried to pay their tab at the cashier stand. The manager gave them a hard time because we all had to be there to pay out but the rest of us were still eating. Annoyed af, I got up there & split the check myself. I expressed to her how terrible of a time we were having and she had no comment. Didn't even take two seconds to say sorry or ask about what happened. She probably trained the girl at the host stand. 

Poor customer service for brunch."}
{"text":"Th decor is somewhat like your in a strip club.. which i think is pretty cool, the  food on the menu is pricey compared to other places, but its because the entree are huge, i find it hard a lot of times to finish my food.  the average price of an entree is around $10 dollars. The place is always packed with people so arrive early if you planning on eating and doing a show or something.. i personally only gone in  for breakfast, and it gets packed sometimes to the point where there are people waiting outside."}
{"text":"First of all I want to say the servings at this restaurant are huge! The service is VERY friendly and attentive. The food and drinks are better than average. It was very Hot inside the establishment. Not sure if this happens all the time or just a random occurrence. The prices was a little lower than the average price for a meal on the Vegas strip. Breakfast is served all day and they are open 24 hours. Prefect place to go after a long night of parting."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of the Peppermill since I was introduced in 1997. My Grandpa (RIP Wilbur) loved the place; he made it a point to stay at the Stardust or Riviera just so he was in immediate walking distance.

The ambiance is great. Classic neon lights and huge fake, tropical trees. The lounge area is super retro, complete with a fireplace. I feel Sinatra-esque when I'm in there sipping on a mule talking at a dame.

Food is quality fare. Nothing crazy or out of the ordinary, but you get a lotta grub, no matter what you order. 

This is also one of the last remaining landmarks on the strip. Hope they never tear you down, Peppermill. I love you."}
{"text":"Historical restaurant that feels like a 1950's Vegas style place. Amazing food w/ big portions. Their menu is robust as well. Service was awesome. And it's open 24/7. I'll prolly stop by here every trip at least once. There's quite a few things on the menu I want to try!!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love all things vintage...my house is old...my furniture is old...I was born in the wrong era, basically.  The Peppermill is like a time capsule from the 80's and has a certain kitschy charm that is irresistible to me.  
They have a restaurant on one side and a lounge on the other side.  We chose to go to the 21+ lounge side to celebrate my hub's birthday. The circular pink plush velvet booths, fake chinese lantern flower vines, and blue neon tubing are so cheesy and awesome.  They have tv's at each booth playing music videos from the 70's.  The waitresses wear floor-length black gowns. They have happy hour every day from 3-6 and from 9-11.  
Went on Saturday 1-9-16 at 6pm for dinner.  $49.67 got us two of their zombie cocktails, a long island ice tea, a glass of moscato, and a chicken tender dinner.  Their drinks are strong and their food portions are very generous.  
I've been here 4 times now and each time the service is spotty...the servers are not overly friendly and they might abandon you for long periods of time.  It took us two hours to eat on Saturday because of the long stretches between seeing our waitress.  
When people come visit us we always take them here...there is no place more \"Vegas\" than the Peppermill! I don't have much more to add that the 1800+ other people haven't already said but if you've never been here you have to check it out."}
{"text":"During the fateful New Year's trip to Vegas, the Peppermill saved our lives time and time again simply by being the closest food source in the proximity of Circus Circus.

Inexpensive and inoffensive. That's how I viewed the restaurant and food. It was early bird specials all over the place. The food might have glimpsed a spice rack in the distance while it was traveling to our table, but it didn't stop to say hello or mingle with anything flavorful. But really, when you're drunk and hungry, tastes get in the way of the  barnyard biological imperative to stuff yourself and soak up the booze.

The waitresses were incredibly friendly, but seemed over-worked as they would accidentally abandon tables to time and history periodically. We recruited the woman hawking souvenir photos to find us someone capable of refilling our coffee and averted disaster that way.

Go if you have time to kill and like bland diner food. Old white folks should love this joint."}
{"text":"Not sure whre they get that different types of colored sugar in that little sugar caddy but I loved it! Breakfast was pretty awesome here and I'm glad I shared a plate with my boyfriend. We didn't even finish what we got (pancakes, fruit, eggs and bacon and sausage). I really liked the neon type of lighting and kinda dark inside style. The staff were all friendly and you can tell that locals come here to it's gotta be good (at least that's what I like to think)."}
{"text":"Love the Peppermill! My coworkers and I had some delectable breakfast offerings on a recent visit. Great service, cool decor, and delicious eats. Also brought  back memories from years ago when i used to frequent this restaurant with friends after a fun-filled night out. Still fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love the decor in this place. Friendly staff across the board. We went for lunch on a Sunday and there was a wait so we checked in and went to the bar. The lounge is super cool, I could hang out all day. Our name was called in about 15 min. From there,? service was prompt and orderly. I got the pita sandwich with a $1.00 upgrade to sweet potato fries as my side. Came with 2 pita sandwiches! So I had dinner for later. My boyfriend got breakfast with scrambled eggs. The missing star is because the scrambled eggs were not good, unappetizing. His plate came with sausages and they were delectable. I was very impressed. Will make sure to visit this 24-hour? establishment every trip to Vegas?."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is hilariously tacky in a sorta 'Classic Vegas' way.  Giant plastic trees, neon colors, the whole 9.

The portions are very large, and the food is standard diner fare.  Nothing special, but not terrible.

The fireside lounge is pretty badass..  There is a fireplace that basically looks like a giant bubbling sterno.  Or a hot tub with a fire in the middle.  The waitress was extremely friendly, and the atmosphere was relaxing.  There are monitors to watch music videos or sports, depending on where you are glancing.

Overall, a nice relaxing way to end a trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"If you want massive portions that take forever to get to your table, this is your place. I've eaten here, maybe 5 times over 15 years. Never a change. The food is not bad but not worth the wait for a table, wait for the server, wait for the food and wait for the to go box because you can't finish."}
{"text":"I love this place because of the sunken sexy 1970's fire pit area - so cool! Great place to wait for your table. Food was good. Sugar is multi colored (fun) staff are cheery and pleasant. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"A friend recommended we try this place while in vegas and since it's open 24 hr and was right in front of our hotel we gave it a try. 

It was a Monday night at 1:30am. The decor looked like Prince threw up all over the restaurant. Very cheesy n tacky not to mention old. We had 4 diff ppl ask if we wanted drinks. The hostess asked even before we could look at the menu. After we receive our drinks she tells us the credit card machine is broken and to pay w cash. Ummm probably shouldve told us that before. But good thing I had cash which I usually don't. 

Food: how can u mess up chicken fingers and a house salad? For the prices they were charging for cafeteria food i expected them to get something right. Besides taking forever to get our food. The lettuce in the salad was browning. And the ranch was running like it had been diluted with water. I don't know if u could call it a salad because it was just iceberg lettuce and croutons for 5.95. The chicken fingers were so hArd they felt like biting into a brick. And their BBQ sauce tasted like hotsauce and ketchup. 

I'm not digging the hooker attire of the staff either. I will most definitely stick to the restaurants at the hotels."}
{"text":"I simply adore the interior! Love the colors and everything. I'm not sure why, it just speaks to me, I guess.

WHAT WAS ORDERED:
Marco Polo Omelet
-- friend got this and I wasn't a big fan of it

Fruit Fantasia Waffle
-- loved it :) especially the blue syrup that comes with it :D

French Toast Ambrosia
-- similar to the Fruit Fantasia Waffle, except, it's French Toast :)

My friends and I all agree that they have huge portions. I don't think any of us has actually finished all our food! Haven't had any complaints about the service. You can split your bill within your party up at the counter.

Will be back again soon :0)."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more but the service is hit and miss. The food is good, but nothing great. It's so mediocre I don't care to write more. 

That said, it's worth a trip to see the history."}
{"text":"This restaurant is full of people. I came for brunch. If I didn't come solo and sit in the bar, I'll have to wait. The reason I came to here because it's near circus circus hotel. Good thing about this restaurant is easy to find and it's not hiding in one of the hotels. They also have its own parking lots. They served very big plates of food. I ordered an omelette and it came with a blue berry muffin and potatoes. It's really too much food for me, Food is just average and not very special. The price is average. The service at bar is very good. Generally it's good experience. Next time I want to come at night and try their cocktail."}
{"text":"5 Stars for excellent customer service.

Walking in we thought it was going to be a long wait to be seated in the dining area because the lobby was so crowded. But sure enough as soon as we got to the hostess stand, she seated us right away! And in a quiet booth in the back so we could eat and have a nice conversation.

I ordered the chicken fingers with fries(11.95) and he ordered the french toast combo with eggs, sausage and bacon( 14.95) 
5 minutes later the huge portions of food arrived!
I am impressed with the portion size that they always prepare. It is worth the extra $ for the amount of food you are served.

My chicken fingers were ok, a little too salty for my taste, but the fries were quite good.
He said his plate was delicious...well he sure ate everything but the plate, Haha!

And, yes i will always go back. I love this restaurant and lounge, its very nostalgic for me as Ive been going here almost 28 years!

Thanks again Peppermill staff, youre the best in town!"}
{"text":"I hate giving spots three stars but this place didn't warrant a terrible two but it also wasn't a good 4. It's just sort of 'meh'. As far as value goes- their portions are large and the pricing is very good compared to most of the eateries on the strip. Wait time for a booth was about 15 minutes but since I was eating alone, I opted to eat at the lounge which was only a 5 minute wait. I ordered the pancake combo- which included 3 large pancakes, 2 sausages, 2 bacon strips and choice of eggs. The pancakes were fluffy but lacking in flavor, but the sausages were very tasty! Couldn't finish the meal even though I was starving. Also ordered 2 muffins to-go (1 blueberry and 1 lemon cranberry) - reheated them in the microwave for 45 seconds and they were delicious! Definitely recommend the muffins!! 
The server who took my order seemed annoyed but the rest of the wait staff was really nice. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit the peppermill again but if my friends wanted to try it out I wouldn't say no either."}
{"text":"Go to the Peppermill!

This is the swankiest bar I've ever been inside.  

It is on the strip.  

It is old vegas.  

The outside looks like a fast food restaurant.  

Go inside.  
Go to the fireside lounge:  Retro, seedy, red, fire, and still cool and smooth.  

Tubbs and Crocket would drink here.  
You'll want to see a wafer-thin model with a cocaine addiction pouring her legs out of a car in the parking lot."}
{"text":"This is a Vegas regular for a late night or early morning breakfast, with cocktails 24 hrs a day!  The food is good, and the atmosphere is perfect for a drunk meal !"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is everything, this place seems like it should be run down but everything inside is in great shape. Food was pretty good.
Next time I'm getting the Scorpion drink, it comes in a fishbowl sized wine glass!"}
{"text":"Flashback to the good ol' days. The lounge has pink and blue neon lights and a fun plush décor.  We stopped in for they're happy hour, which runs EVERYDAY from 3pm to 6pm and 9pm to 11pm with drink and food specials.  We of course had to sit in the area with the fire pit.

While we were enjoying our drinks a young lady came by and offered to take a complimentary Peppermill souvenir photo for us. It's really cute. You also have the option to buy a larger version. The staff we encountered were all friendly and polite.      

The Peppermill is open 24 hours a day, 7 day's a week, so make the time to stop in and enjoy the vibe."}
{"text":"was quite disappointed at first because they only have ONE fireside pit. I thought this place would have many since that's what they do advertise to consumers. Second, wasn't a big fan of the laid back ambiance. Wanted something more upbeat.

Other than that, this is a great place to go to if you want to get away from all the clubs and strip bars on the strip. It's very relaxing - comfy & large couches, chill music, and good drinks. I ordered the scorpion and it comes in a huge bowl mixed with various alcohols!"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on Sunday and it was packed! Luckily, they have a lounge area where you can order drinks and sit in front of a fire pit over water while you wait to be called. The Fireside Lounge definitely gives you a reminiscent vibe of old school Vegas with the pink and purple neon lights.  

After my second Bloody Mary, the hour flew by quickly! ;) Once seated, I ordered the steak and 3 eggs, which came with hashbrowns and your choice of toast or muffins ($19 before tax). The portions were HUGE! I was pleasantly surprised by how tender the steak was! I ordered the eggs over medium and it was cooked to my exact preference. As for the hashbrowns, it was crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. It really is a great diner and I could see why it was so packed! This place is great for any meal of the day since they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Vegas classic...drinks are obnoxious...but hilariously awesome at same time...it's crazy so you have to go."}
{"text":"Food and Fire! If you are going to eat (which you simply MUST do before you die), then you have to be hungry. The portions are huuuuuge and extremely tasty, and they give you yummy garlic bread while you wait. The portions are serious, and you could easily split a dish, and have an appetizer or salad.  The desserts are to die for, but who has room? I also thought it seemed quite a bit more expensive than it used to, which was a bummer. We were sat in a corner, and had the pleasure of hearing.every.single.word of a very loud girl on her first date with a real charmer (not really). We heard of her arrest, how she teaches little kids, that she has a DUI, and that he has a gaggle of children with an array of women. The point is, some of the seating is a little close for comfort. The fire pit lounge is a life altering event as well, so do try it out while you are there. Never change Peppermill!"}
{"text":"I love this place the margaritas are soooo yummy! the nachos are yummy! One time we ordered the fruit platter. OMG so much of everything and they give you a mini banana bread with it!! So fluffy and delishious!  I love the classy cocktail waitresses, and the over all mood of this place. You can be dressed up or dressed down, everyone is welcomed at all times of the day! 24/7!! One of my favorite places!! love the neon lounge!! too cozy!"}
{"text":"Our limo driver suggested this place so we had to give it a try...

I know it was probably an accident, but I found a strand of long hair in my sausage and another in my drink. Unlucky coincidence or they just hated me?

I got sick and threw up a few hours later.

My French toast, bacon, and eggs tasted good but ended up clogging the sink."}
{"text":"The portions are large, but at $29 the ribeye was very fatty. The dinner salad was large, but why do so many places serve that gelatinous Italian dressing that may or may not have oil and vinegar in them?"}
{"text":"Came in for a drink the other night.  I hadn't been here in a looooong time (a good 8 years) and it's exactly how I remembered, which in itself is AMAZING.

I have never eaten at the diner, only ever been to the lounge.

The lounge is really fun.  There's a fire pit.  There's super comfy round banquette seating.  There's an abundance of fake flowers and tv screens playing music from literally every era.  When are you gonna hear Dean Martin and No Doubt back to back?  The servers are dressed in long black gowns and some of them even wear sateen gloves.  They have to squat down when taking your order.  The drinks are good.

You can feel comfortable coming here whether your in a group, a couple or solo."}
{"text":"Peppermill is our favorite place to eat in LV... the price is right, the portions are heaping, and the staff is friendly! we've never had to wait for a table, and when you sit down, everything is sensory... from the glowing neon, to the sassy staff outfits and the colorful decor, it leaves nothing to be desired!  

did i mention that the table sugar is RAINBOW.  RAINBOW, people, RAINBOW.  

the waffles are amazing. The chicken parm is the size of a small baby. the pastries are pretty good, but not worth writing home about."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday morning around 11am. Had a feeling the wait might be long considering the time. Easily found a parking spot so I had a good feeling it might not be that bad, but then saw a mass of people outside, then a mass of people inside. Uh oh...its got to be a 45 minute wait and I'm starving, so I started to think of where else to go as I approached the hostess stand. \"It will be about 10-15 minutes\" she said. Wow!

And it was about 10 minutes. This place knows how to move people in and out fast. Within mere seconds of sitting down, a waitress drops off the 24 hour menus and takes a quick drink order. I ordered the eggs benedict and my friend buffalo wings, extra hot. Food was out in about 10 minutes.

Eggs benedict comes with 3 poached eggs over two English muffins and a side of potatoes. All was cooked great. Hollandaise sauce was a bit lacking in flavor though. I'll give the food 3 stars. Nothing special. My friend said her wings weren't that spicy. They were pretty good sized though.

Overall, the service is what makes this place special, along with the cool decor. While sitting there we were approached for bar drinks twice, and a free photo which I doubt is actually free. My first time here I had a chicken fried steak which was pretty decent, but the eggs benedict weren't all that this time so I'll try another meal next time I'm back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I needed a break from the upscale, so we tried a place with neon lighting, short skirted cocktail servers and mirrored ceilings.  We sat kitty corner to a slew of hair band impersonators, which just seemed to enhance the absurdity of the place.  Our food was great, seemed healthier than most quick bite places and our cocktails were strong.  What more can one expect from one of the older dives in Vegas?"}
{"text":"For the past 15 years, every trip I make to Vegas (and there have been many) I always stop in Peppermill Lounge for a drink. Maybe it's nostalgia - not sure, but I love this place. 

The lounge has firesides, usually cheesy music videos on the TV, pretty girls in long black dresses and stiff drinks. 

Breakfast at 4 am or drinks at 2pm - I enjoy the Peppermill and it's definitely always a part of my Vegas itinerary."}
{"text":"Excellent Food - great atmosphere! A fun place for locals and visitors.  I am a local in Vegas and always bring friends and family for a bite to eat and a Martini around the indoor fire pit!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Peppermill forever and throughout the years it has remained one of those Very-Vegas places to eat. Though the times and the menu have changed a bit over the years, the atmosphere of the place has remained pretty much the same. 

The menu changing is actually a good thing. The portion of the food have diminished somewhat, which makes their meals much more manageable. They used to be so large that you were almost forced to eat too much. Now, they are just about right.

The place can get crowded at times and depending on who is taking care of you, the service can be touch and go. But, this restaurant remains a must go to on the Vegas strip. It is like stepping back by a decade or two."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place for years and never once thought about stopping here until this trip to Vegas. I'm glad we did pop in and check them out, because this was a very positive experience. 

The decor is much nicer than one would expect from just looking at the outside of the place, and it was full of patrons once you got into the dining area. Because this is Vegas, in addition to the normal waitstaff (busboy, and waitress) they also have cocktail waitresses who stop by your table to take any alcohol orders you might want to place. We went for breakfast, so it was a bit early for me- but hey, it's Vegas! Plenty of people were drinking at 9:30 in the morning. 

I had the oatmeal, which comes with a lot of toppings, and bacon. My wife had the two egg breakfast with bacon. We were both pleased with our meals, I will certainly plan on eating here again. They offer everything on their menu 24/7, so you can have breakfast, lunch, or dinner no matter time of day you show up. I like that. I like that a lot. 

There is a very cool looking bar in the back with some very cool sunken seating areas. It looked very interesting, hopefully next time I come it will be at least noon so I can have a drink with a clear conscience!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in Vegas. Open 24 hours, they're at the North end of the strip, by the Riviera. You never know who you will run into in this place. Stars, athletes, pimps...everybody in Vegas finds their way into The PepperMill sooner or later. They make great Omelets, and awesome Bloody Mary's for those early breakfasts when you're not quite done partying. The place is done in purple neon, like it's 1970, but it's not run down--just stuck in time.  It's clean, the food is fresh, and the portions are huge. This is the can't miss it 3am breakfast destination. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Just have to... iconic, wonderful. Not red Naugahyde seats but crushed velvet perhaps. The breakfast we had was great and tons of food for around $15. I had the eggs Benedict and he had an omelet. Both perfectly cooked and presented. The bar/lounge area... if you have to wait for a table, is a gem. It's worth having a drink in the lounge just to feel the old Vegas style. So, speaking of, the Bloody Mary I had was the best. Spicy and so yummy! Just love the Peppermill for what it is... good hearty food, in a classic Vegas setting."}
{"text":"Everything here is HUGEEEEE! (like me) Unless you are a pro wrestler or a huge pothead, you will never finish the entire plate. Share with someone. Trust a honky! Peace!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a kid. That's 40 years folks. My mom, huge Vegas goer that she was, loved the place.  It's a tradition.  Every Vegas trip includes a meal at The Peppermill.

I don't think it's really changed all that much over the years and that's cool. Same great food, same big portions, same good service, and same ultra tacky Vegas decor.  Awesome.

Versatile. That's what The Peppermill really is. Open 24 hours. So, whether you're dining at the traditional \"breakfast, lunch, dinner\" hours or it's 3:30 am and you have to pool your money with your buddy because you lost big; the place hits.

All of their fare is good. Never have had a bad meal or service here.  

I hope I never have to utter the words, \"Remember The Peppermill in Vegas?\" 

Go. Trust me."}
{"text":"Havent been here in a while, so I decided to come back to actually try out the food this time. I used to come here to drink and meet up with friends. I was in the mood for a steak so I ordered the ribeye the food came out in a timely manner and the service was good . Sad to say the steak was not as good as the service . I'm a better stick myself and that is what I compared to. I felt like I ordered from a one star restaurant. I literally wanted to bring in my own cow and show them how to really make some good steak . I guess next time I'll stay in and cook my own."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I visited the peppermill line was huge there was an hour wait and it sucked not being able to make a reservation. Had brunch here with friends I ordered the French toast with the fruit and whipped cream. Loved how they had a photographer to take pictures at the table, she was very sweet. Food was ok loved the portion size and presentation."}
{"text":"Good food with lots of variety and fast, friendly service.  This restaurant was a welcome relief from all the over-priced places on the Strip--so great to not have to sacrifice quality of good for an affordable price!"}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! Wanted to get away from the commotion of the Strip, but still get good food. The Peppermill exceeded our expectations. Today I decided to try breakfast, Munchies' Favorite. It was not like anything I've had before, but it was delicious. I definitely would recommend French's to anyone looking for great food and huge portions at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Tried dinner here for once and it was delish. I ordered chicken wings with sauce on the side. It was so good. Crispy and fresh. Big pieces of chicken so I should have just ordered 10 piece not 16. My boyfriend ordered the philly cheese steak sandwich with onion rings. So good. Server was very nice and quick. Checked on us a few times too. I'd definitely come back here and order the exact same thing for dinner again."}
{"text":"Holy retro mother of god! THIS IS the classic old Vegas I miss!!! Decor was spot on, got right in at midnight. The hostess was very nice and quick and I gotta say, Destiny...our server...Bent over backwards for us. She really made the experience perfect. Got the nachos and she said they feed four or five and she ain't kidding!!! I had to tap out but can't wait to get back to the Peppermill."}
{"text":"HUGE portions.  Thought I was safe by getting a sandwich, but it was basically two sandwiches and a mountain of fries.  Definitely split entrees with someone if you can.  Decent food and very reasonably priced.  Interesting decor..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Seriously, where else can you find a 24 hour restaurant with velvet couches and trees growing in between the booths. They also give huge portions on some of the food, and offer an expansive cocktail list. Bar is pretty cool, too. I love the fire pit! With slot machines in the lobby, Peppermill is the epitome of a Vegas coffee shop! I love it!"}
{"text":"As for many things in Vegas, disappointment comes from over-priced, mediocre food complete with tacky neon lights. 
The food there was bland and uneventful. I had the chicken pesto sandwich that could have been decent if it weren't for the pile of dry mixed greens smashed on the dry bread. There was cheese in there somewhere and little globs of pesto, but paired with a gristley piece of chicken I was far from impressed. And I know what you're thinking- it's diner food, right? Well, I've been to my fair share of diners and had some really decent meals. This was not one of them.  I got fries on the side which were, shockingly, also not good. Some were cold, some were warm, but all of them mushy. Gross. 
My husband got an omelet with turkey and cheese and hollandaise sauce. He seemed to think it was okay, but not great. The egg was overcooked and made for a hard, chunk of omelet. 
The best part of this mess... oh wait, there is no best part... the bill was $28 for the two of us and that was without drinks. 
I give this place one star for tacky, over the top, quintessential  Vegas décor and ambiance. Also, the waitresses wear these terrible tie-dye colored outfits where you can basically see their asses. Except these are not asses you'd want to see.  And then cocktail waitresses come out from the fire side area wearing formal wear to take your drink order. This place is a mess and I recommend it only if you're desperate to go broke for crap food."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday for lunch time. Easy parking right in front, we were sat right away, I absolutely love the decor, the staff was friendly, I ordered the pastrami burger with fries and it was really good."}
{"text":"IMHO the best place on the strip for a cool dark drink. Or an early breakfast to recuperate from last night. We've been coming here when in Vegas for 20 years, and the funky color scheme and friendly service remain authentic. Breakfasts are huge and about $13, but they don't mind two people sharing. Did I mention they have the best Bloody Mary west of New Orleans? The servers are fast and really friendly. Special shout out to our server Alicia!"}
{"text":"The portions are huge, but the quality is lacking. The hash brown looked like thick fettuccini and it wasn't cooked right. The servers are super nice."}
{"text":"It's on the strip, there's plenty of storefront parking and it's open 24 hours.  If you're on a budget and you want good, plentiful food, this is the place for you. There's even a cool bar inside the restaurant so you can have that extra cocktail while you wait for your grub.

The menu is huge and I believe you'll find something you'll like, I eye jacked other peoples plates as I walked in and everything looked good."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great ~ The decor is very pretty having neon lights around really make it feel different. Parking can be fun sometimes when they are busy. It is right on the strip. It can get really busy but the place is really a good size. The only reason when in Vegas we don't go more often is because when the strip is busy it is a hassle trying to go there.
But we highly recommend this place!  If your close by you need to try it."}
{"text":"This is a Las Vegas MUST!  The Peppermill is the BEST breakfast place I have ever visited!  It's very busy and there is a good reason for it, it's worth the wait!  If you are over 21, you can start the morning in the lounge. It has the \"Old Vegas\" feel to it.  They have a round fire place in there with a blue flame that you can enjoy your morning Mimosa at. You just have to see it!  For breakfast, try the fruit waffle fantasia or french toast ambrosia.  They are both amazing!  If you love omelets, try the Spinach, Feta, Provolone, Tomato, Artichoke one. OMG....the best ever!  I come home and fantasize about it....seriously!  The location is next to the Riviera and across the street from Circus Circus!  Enjoy!   Amy"}
{"text":"Trust me you'd be better off finding a Denny's or an IHOP. It's crowded, smells of smoke and my food (scrambled eggs and Canadian bacon) was dismal. Texture, taste- it was all off. The Muffin was good and the coffee was good. That's the extent of it. But I did get to pay $15 for leaving most of it on the plate. So there's that. Maybe if they cut the portion size in half they could make it taste better."}
{"text":"This place is Vegas tacky yet kitsch cool and the food, drinks and service was very good.

Came here for what was meant to be late breakfast but ended up being early lunch.

We ordered the crab cakes to get started and I have to say they were so damn good I could have just ordered more for my main meal.
However I ordered what was the best Ruben sandwich I have ever had in my life. 
Was full of flavour and so big I could barely  eat half of it.
My boyfriend and his friend both got the pastrami sandwich which were both as big and my girlfriend had a burger.
The margarita  bomb we had to wash it down was super good and super strong... No complaints there!
Waitresses were very friendly and happy to assist.
Will be back for more next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"There were three of us for dinner (after getting snubbed at Phil's Italian Steakhouse inside Treasure Island).

The restaurant side was bright and fun. As we were three big guys, we ate at the cafe` bar. We didn't want to try squeezing into a booth. The server was friendly, fun, and knowledgeable about all the food. She even brought out one of the cooks to answer a question from the 'caveman diva' of our group (no, that was not me). 

My NY strip steak was really good. The shrimp scampi was okay (which is the reason they didn't get five stars). The meatball soup was great! Probably because it tasted very similar to the version I make at home. The other two people in my group also thought the food was good...including the caveman. The menu selection is huge! As much as I wanted dessert, I declined as I was stuffed.

We ate on the restaurant side and I plan to go back to visit the lounge side. 

I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"23 years and I have never ventured here.. until yesterday .
Fun fireside lounge! Great food and service. The outfits are very cute. 
Sorry about the sugar but apparently it's a must do here while you're waiting on your food!
Milkshake gets an A+
&& bonus points for having curly fries and Frank's Red Hot."}
{"text":"Usually have a great experience here and always look forward to it. I always order the fruit platter and share since it is so big.  This time I thought about asking for watermelon only instead of honeydew and cantaloupe and they made it that way.  This time instead of a slice of banana bread I got a whole mini loaf.  The fruit platter has a nice assortment with strawberries, grapes, pears, pineapple, kiwi and the melon.  The disappointing thing and reason for low stars was had leftovers that I took back and next morning strawberries were moldy already."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is a Las Vegas institution.  It's got an old-school Vegas interior and a great vibe.  You won't find a better place to grab a 3AM meal, or a great hangover breakfast. 

The portions are huge and the food is just great.  It's a diner, so don't expect an upscale, romantic atmosphere, but you can almost feel the history in this place.

Ham & Cheese Omlet, Hashbrowns, Toast and a Tea for $15.  No way you can eat all of it....."}
{"text":"Vintage Vegas at it's best! The retaurant is cool, but the lounge is awesome!! Perfect late-night spot for couples."}
{"text":"have to admit I was surprised.  Cheap looking neon lights.. Water with fire in the middle I thought this this as 1980s as it gets.  But the service make up for the a tasteless decor.  Food was below average but the blood marry s is a must have big and spice. Teo of these babies and your hangover gas left las vegas"}
{"text":"My favorite dinner in Vegas! The country fried steak is bomb.com! I always order that with extra gravy. Portions are huge. The nachos is pretty good too. The place is lively with neon lights and looks like a club rather than a dinner lol."}
{"text":"Went to the fireside lounge on a Saturday night. Relaxed, friendly no-nonsense bartender, good drinks. Would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We spend generously and tip generously and still we get ignored. 
Forget water or coffee refills or checking back how you food is It'll never happen. 
6 servers 2 customers and still the service sucked."}
{"text":"Staying at the Wynn and wanting to get out of the hotel for breakfast one day, I came across this place on Yelp.  So this review is just for breakfast as they seem to be open 24 hours and have a fully separate bar area.

A short walk or drive from the Wynn with free parking, we got there before 9am and were seated right away, but then it started getting really busy as we were there.  They have an extensive menu and also have a cocktail waitress walking around for those that need a little \"hair of the dog\" in the AM.  The food was great and very generous portions, although probably a little more expensive than the Denny's down the street, but obviously nowhere near what it would cost to eat breakfast at the Wynn!

I would highly recommend if you are at this end of the Strip or have a car and looking for a good breakfast place on way downtown, etc.  Look forward to checking out the lounge on our next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"So, not the greatest breakfast spot on the strip, but a formidable landmark nonetheless. The place was packed on a recent visit with about a 20 minute wait. Fortunately, the on-site slots and adjoining lounge pacified my patience. Buyer beware, as bar drinks ran an arm and a leg...a double Red Bill Vodka pushing $15. In any case, Monstrous Bloody Mary's for $8.50, corned beef hash, poached eggs, and some crab cakes Benedict hit the spot after an early flight from the Windy City. Prices were inflated, but WTF, it's the Strip. Service was friendly enough considering the packed house and slowed food output. Certainly worth a stop for first timers; however, not sure there's enough to demand a return visit from these Southsiders..."}
{"text":"Was here on vacation  in Las Vegas.  This was my friend's  and I  first breakfast  of the vacation.  And it hit the spot!  Good service,  damn good food,  good enough price.  And you get a free photo taken and buy more if you'd like.  I enjoyed  the food, I was full and truly  satisfied.  I ate this food in the morning and it held me over  till dinner time.  I wanted to go back too,  but it didn't fit into the schedule.  I recommend  this place."}
{"text":"It was off again to Peppermill for another great meal!

This time I enjoyed a Spinach Salad with cut eggs, spinach leaves, substantial bacon, and tangy French-style Dressing (although Hot Bacon Dressing would have been more appropriate), followed by two fine Gyros with soothing cool cucumber Tzaki Sauce, tomatoes, and White Onions.  The large sandwiches were accompanied by great skin-on Red Potato Salad.  

Other guests in my party savored a Gourmet Chicken Salad, Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich, and Scrambled Eggs, Canadian Bacon, and crispy Hash Browns, along with an excellent warm Bran Muffin that I sampled.  The ambiance here is always upbeat, casual, and comfortable.  And service was very good.  My only gripe is that my salad wasn't removed after I finished it.

I will surely return another day for more fine comfort food!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family when we went on vacation to Las Vegas. We stayed at the Circus Circus hotel and Peppermill was a short distance away and one of the locals suggested it to us, so we decided to try it out.

The portions here are HUGE. We ended up ordering two entrees for the three of us since we weren't that hungry, but there was still more than enough food for the three of us. We ordered ribs expecting a few and ended up getting a whole rack. For the money spent, you do get a good amount of food. We ended up taking some home.

The environment itself is one-of-a-kind. They have a sort of retro feel with neon lights and booths for seating. The booths are very intimate; it's a semicircle around a table so you can see and talk to everyone.

The only fault was the service was very informal and casual. My family and I had just walked to the restaurant from the strip, so after a very long day we were exhausted and starving. When we arrived, no one was in front of us or appeared to be waiting, but the two girls at the front were chatting away with each other. They definitely saw us come in, and we were standing in front of them, but they still didn't acknowledge us or stop their conversation. We almost just left, but at the last minute they finally seated us."}
{"text":"Loved it! Actually we loved it so much, we ate there 3 times over the week we were in Vegas. Very reminiscent of the \"old Las Vegas\" and almost nostalgic. Truly a visual spectacle! The only thing better than the food was the appearance of the restaurant.

The decor is some of the most interesting I've seen with exotic plant life all around you and neon running the walls and ceilings. The lounge was fantastic and very upscale looking with the round oversized cushions and tables. 21 and over in there, so that portion of the restaurant is not for kids.

Food portions are huge! Each time my girlfriend and I took leftovers back to the hotel. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day everyday. We didn't wait long at all for food or drink! Service was exceptional each time regardless of when we went. A huge perk in itself!

Convenient and easy to get to with a large side lot and front lot. Parking is not an issue. So be sure to swing by and give the Peppermill a try! You won't be disappointed, just be sure to bring your appetite!!"}
{"text":"If you're really hungry, this is definitely the place to come too! It's sort of like a Denny's, but better. Different type of vibe. Very dim lights. Purple everywhere! Jungle type of theme.

Also, since food and drinks can be pricey elsewhere on the strip, this place is reasonably priced. 

I think that this should be a MUST go to, especially if you are new in town. Food and service is great."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars i would, after looking at all the reviews my husband and i were all's excited to come in a try the food, but we never got to taste it, when you first walk in you they put you on waiting list which is fine, however when they took our names down the girl she told us that we only 1 other party in front of, they called the party and we're next, but they they never called us, more people kept coming in and they sat them right away without even wring there name, after about 20min my husband got and the girls how much longer and all she said was that she forgot that we were next, it's funny too me how she forgot but she had all those 20 min to talk to her other coworkers, first and last I come here!!! The girls need to pay better attention"}
{"text":"Just like old Vegas. Retro diner style vibe and the fire pit lounge is a must see. Came here for brunch 10 am on a Monday and the wait was minimal. I tried the Southern Fried Steak and it hit the spot. Ample portion, but the taste was not compromised. I got it with hash browns and over medium eggs. The hash browns were crispy and the eggs were cooked properly. Both were good. Now onto the main event. The Southern Fried Steak had an acceptable amount of breading and \"healthy\" portion of beef rounds. Seasoning came through with the savory, yet not overly heavy, gravy sauce. I especially liked the hints of mushroom. This is a must try dish! 

Others ordered the Veggie Omelette, Pork Loin with Eggs, and Crab Cakes. All said their food was good. They appreciated the value-based portions. Looks like most dishes are safe bets here.

Service was relatively prompt and friendly considering it was busy. Check this place out, if you want to refresh from all thee foo-foo restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"We only being at the lounge drinks  are okay... food sucks
Raw chicken wings....sometimes the waitress had bad days very noticeable 
Years ago the Lounge use  to be darker.
Now to bright..... WTF... is a lounge at las vegas night time.
. Most of that bartenders the old school they thing that the own the place.
Still a nice place."}
{"text":"Oh Peppermill. Why do I love you so?
This place has a really special place in my heart......perhaps it's due in part to the nostalgia I feel because of the many memories I've made in the COUNTLESS trips there after club night outs, birthday parties or just because In the last decade. 
Every time I go, I'm never disappointed with the price, food or location. 
Their drink menu is extensive and fun. The food .... Every order will undoubtedly require a box. The location naturally entails a plethora of interesting people (celebrities and hookers a like) . When in Vegas..... Peppermill it."}
{"text":"I took my baby boy here for his 27th birthday dinner since we had such a great experience on our last visit. He loves this restaurant and it is a real treat since it really is one of a kind.

This restaurant has a fun atmosphere, great service, great food and always leaves you full and happy every time!

We ordered fish and chips and southern fried steak which came with choice of bread and salad or soup. The both of these dishes were fantastic and he had to take half of his meal home as there must have been 2 pounds of curly fries with his fish and chips lol.

I snuck away and informed the staff that we were celebrating a birthday so I picked out a dessert to present him with!

I chose the THE ELEGANT BROWNIE, a yummy chocolate fudge brownie served steaming hot with a mound of creamy French vanilla ice cream, smothered in warm chocolate fudge sauce and layered with whipped cream and sprinkles.  This dessert was ridiculous good, that homemade brownie and combination of fudge and ice cream was insane orgasmic good! 

They came to the table with his dessert lit up with a candle and sang happy birthday and it was so much fun!

Our experience is always stellar here and every time they always manage to top the last visit."}
{"text":"I could write a ten page diatribe on why I love this place.  I will start with a review for the lounge.  I will then proceed with a review for the restaurant.  I will then sum up my LOVE for Peppermill with a review for their \"banquet\" services - because, yes, when you get married in Vegas... you MUST have your reception at the Peppermill.  That's the only way to roll in this town.

Lounge:  seedy, swanky, and fabulous!  The service is fantastic.  I love that these are the most dressed up cocktail waitresses in Vegas.  Long sleek black gowns.  Nice touch.  The drinks are fabulous.  In the morning.  In the afternoon.  At 2 am.  They are delicious, potent, and worth the money.  I love the flaming fire pit adorned with tvs.  I love the electric glow of purple and pink.  The fake foliage?  Very nice.  The chairs are comfortable (even though I have a small fear of what might be on them in the darkest corners, I take some relief in the glowing purple lights overhead... about as close to black light as we're gonna get).  Looking for a nice place to hang out with your buddies after a late night?  Or a place to get the party started at 10 pm?  Peppermill lounge is the perfect spot.  I would say the parking is super easy.  The lot behind the building is huge.  But if you're going to drink... you won't need to worry about parking.  Take a cab.  They're located at the north end of The Strip, on the immediate north side of Ross Dress For Less.  Now go.  Drink.  And Be Merry.

Restaurant:  bring an appetite.  And a tupperware container or three.  The food is fun.  There is a great variety of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options.  I've never had anything here I didn't like.  The portions are MASSIVE.  You can eat until chorizo is popping out of your ears and then you'll look down and still see half of your plate full of food.  Good thing there are fridges in the rooms at the hotel!  The blueberry muffins are warm, moist, and delicious.  Don't waste your time on boring ol' toast.  Oh, you wanted the banana nut bread?  Yeah - you're going to receive and entire LOAF of banana nut bread.  Prepare to share.  My friend ordered the fruit plate with marshmallow dipping sauce.  They brought her a fruit cart (exaggerating, people... but go with it).  In all seriousness - she probably ate her 5 servings of fruit and still took home THREE containers of fruit for later.  And a 2/3 of a a banana bread.  If you're looking for a good deal in Vegas - eat here.  You'll easily get two meals out of one.  And when you're hung over and hankering for a little something when you roll in the door at 5 am - why not nosh on a little banana bread?

Banquet services:  Hubs and I had a morning wedding.  Celebrated with champagne and cupcakes immediately after (see my review for The Cupcakery in Henderson, NV).  Then we took all of our guests to lunch at The Peppermill.  We made arrangements with JoAnn a few weeks prior... selected a set menu, picked out colors and table decorations, got a map of the restaurant to make a seating arrangement... and all we had to do was show up.  It was such a blast!  We had about 1/3 of the restaurant blocked off just for us.  Cocktail waitresses took orders, waitresses took food orders, and we were good to go.  We are proud to say that our friends had never had a bacon cheeseburger at a wedding reception until they came out ours!  Chicken foccacia?  Yup.  Fruit platter.  All us.  The atmosphere was so much fun.  The tables looked fantastic.  The service was excellent.  And it was so neat to see our names on the little display board when we first arrived.  I'm not a traditional sit-down boring reception type person... so the Peppermill fit my and my husbands personality perfectly.  I think everyone had a good time and I'm forever grateful to JoAnn and the crew at The Peppermill for helping to make my special day that much more special... and unique!  

If you're looking for something \"Vegasy\" to do while in Vegas, plan a trip to the Peppermill.  AND you can say you saw the table that Vince Vaughn sat at in Swingers.  How can you say not to that???"}
{"text":"Portions are huge, ambience is unique, food is tasty, bar is worth the trip.  If you come to Las Vegas and want to have a great meal in a classic place, you must make the trip here.  If you are alone, try sitting at the counter and enjoying watching the cooks and servers interact.  The Peppermill is just fantastic."}
{"text":"I was super excited to eat here.  TWO hours of waiting.   Underestimated table wait.    20 minutes wait for a cup of coffee in the lounge.  More waiting.  Now empty beverages while we wait for the food.    DON'T come on a weekend.   If there is a wait of any kind, leave immediately!"}
{"text":"Had been so looking forward to trying this place and was really disappointing.

This place is always so busy when we visit Vegas. Most of the time there is a 30 minute wait so we just find somewhere else to go. We finally managed to get a table without having to wait and were expecting to be blown away with the food, but it was very mediocre.
  
Plus points - portions are good, atmosphere was nice

Negative points - food was very mediocre, prices are high for the quality of food

With Vegas having so many awesome restaurants I cant see myself spending my money here ever again."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool atmosphere it is open 24/7 which is a plus and the prices are very reasonable they have a large food and drink selection it would be hard to find much better with all things considered, on a sidenote our qaitress was really slow and did not stay on top of our drinks and took about a half hour to bring us our check but peppermill still gets 5 stars"}
{"text":"This is a must see, must do Vegas bar if you're into the history of Las Vegas. Drinks aren't outrageously priced as they are everywhere else on the strip and you can't beat the vibe in here.  A scene with DeNiro and Sharon Stone was filmed in the Fireside Lounge in the movie Casino...go for that reason alone!"}
{"text":"First let me say this restaruant is all over the place. When you walk in and take a look at the decor you are immediately taken back to the 70s. 

There's a separate bar area from the restaurant inside known as fireside which is right by the restroom area.  Inside you will find a fire pit within a jacuzzi, along with neon lights,  trees, and velvet chairs and couches.

Inside the main restaurant the theme continues from the waitresses outfits to the specialty drinks that are on the back of the menu. My mom was taken back by the drinks since she hasn't seen them being poured (made) in a while. Kudos for that!!

As for the food everything we had was really good. We enjoyed the French Toast combo and Munchs breakfast. The portions were large and filling and the price couldn't be beat.

While at the restaurant we ran into a couple who stated they were told about this place by their limo driver. The couple had only heard of IHOP, and the driver told them that, \"IHOP was like kissing your mother and this place was like kissing your lover.\" I thought that was a funny analogy."}
{"text":"The food was great and the portions were HUGE. I ordered the Southwest Chicken Salad and it was really delicious. My husband had a burger and he said it was great, too. Definitely the best deal on the strip as far as price/quantity. The service was also good, and I enjoyed receiving a free picture from their in-house photographer."}
{"text":"Omg, this place is great!! The food is delicious and the portions are huge! Service is great and the ambiance is amazing! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is hands down, the COOLEST lounge Ive ever been too. (not too sure about the Restaurant part) Its cozy, comfy, great for conversation with friends. The fire pit is really neat! the drink price is average.The only downfall is, like all the vegas casinos,  they let you smoke inside (yuck!) If your tired of walking up and down the strip and are trying to avoid all the crowded bars, this is the place to go! its a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Fruit plate was enormous, fresh with great variety.  Gyros were very tasty.   Decor is kind of neat with neons and cozy booths. Waitresses were very nice and had cute uniforms.  Overall, one of my very best Vegas eating experiences.   Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"This place was on my list for a LONG time.  When you come to a place like this, you should know what to expect from the food.  Diner food is why you come here.  I ordered the corn beef hash.  It was solid and the portions were generous.  Atmosphere is why you come here, the neon lights with the indoor (fake?) vegetation.  Never a bad time to come here for diner food since it is opened 24/7."}
{"text":"I ordered a Belgian waffle which was good.  My sister ordered the chicken strips and fries.  Her plate was mainly filled with fries.  My friend ordered a milkshake and we wondered where her silver mixing cup was with the rest of the milkshake.  Our waitress was a bit on the slow side and she was not very polite.  The food was good, the service could have been better.  It was funny looking at all the different outfits the employees were wearing."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast and it was good. The portions are ridiculously big! I would just share with someone lol. The lounge/bar has neon blue lights and pretty dark In there, but it's chill. Has a water and fire thingy w TVs around it. Good drinks, decent prices. The decor is pretty wild, worth the trip to check it out. Prices are decent, has a big parking lot, and a few slots if you still want to gamble lol. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"This place gives huge portions. I had the munch and my date had the corned beef hash. Both were decent. The coffee was good. The service was also good. Reason it gets 2 stars is because both me and my date had massive diarrhea, not the water dribble kind, but like the epic volcanic type, where your stomach growls like a feral cat and your butthole feels like a flamethrower. So, would I go back? Nah, the after effects are not worth huge portions."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time!!! Wow! what terrible service! It was my first time ever going to peppermill. I've heard about it through the grapevine after living here for 6 years. Finally, after a night out i wanted to try it. Got sat at a table and waited 15 MINUTES and NOBODY even greeted us. We were so starving and sick of waiting we left to go drive through mcdonalds. What a waste of time! Not worth 1 star.

Btw, there were 3 other tables sat."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely caters to a specific demographic that doesn't consist of foodies, isn't diverse, and has a lot to love, if you know what I mean (which is why the reviews are so many and so high). Food was okay at best and portions were massive, with trashy looking decor. Leaving this review because I want people to know the reviews are biased."}
{"text":"I take anyone who comes to visit to the Fireside Lounge and we always have a blast.   It's a perfectly cheesy wonderland with kick ass bar food and 90s music video gold!   Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Recommended by 2 people on our weekend away and it definitely did not disappoint! Great food, huge portions and wonderful service. Loved the way it's decorated - so retro and \"Vegasy.\" Highly recommend for breakfast and will always eat here when we come back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in the restaurant before heading over to the lounge. The food was decent and the portions are huge. The lounge is where its at though. We had the scorpion, and despite the 1 bad review where a girl claims she had to leave after a few sips, we thought it was tasty. Its just like any other fruity fishbowl drink. The decor what amusing... My boyfriend and I love dives, and this place hit the spot. It was a well needed break after 5 days on the strip."}
{"text":"After my wedding on Saturday, we had an impromptu early dinner/mini-reception on the recommendation of my Dad who came here in the late 70's. 

I'm a big fan of classic places that have lots of nostalgia. This one fit the bill perfectly. The wife and I split a couple 64oz Scorpions while I had Munch's Breakfast and she had a BLT.  All 14 people there loved the food and nobody was able to eat their entire plate. 

We retired to the Lounge for a Mai Tai or two and had a great time. Best of all, my Dad said it was just how he remembered it from over 30 years ago. I'd return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Have you ever wanted to eat on a cruise ship on dry land? In the middle of the desert at that? If you even answered maybe this is the place for you. 

The food is decent and was hearty as well. The dishes and silverware lacked the sanitary expectations and we were able to ask for replacements. 

Prices are good for food on the strip."}
{"text":"It's a good place to go at 3 am. The decor and ambiance is kinda old school 70's/80's-ish. The food is okay. It is just an OKAY place. Not bad but not great. I love the fire pits inside though, that was a cool feature. Seems to be a pretty busy spot. I would go back if a friend wanted to go, not on my own though."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We loved it all. 
I'm giving 4 out of 5 because there was a 30 minute wait, the table wasn't cleaned yet, there was no silverware and the waitress gave 3 of our 4 plates to the wrong person. Long line when we left too."}
{"text":"I hate to admit I first came to this place because of \"Anthony Bourdain no reservations.\" For years I've driven by this place thinking that it looks like a Vegas rendition of a Denny's. When you first walk in, the Vegas Denny's theme still holds true with one small exception. You will notice a double glass door in the back left corner that leads to the Peppermill's Fireside Lounge. The 5 stars is solely for the Fireside Lounge and not the Restaurant. 
You instantly enter into a late 60's early 70's themed lounge that relaxes and surprises in the same breath. The decor looks like they actually had well kept furniture from the 70's imported through some kind of time portal and not the new furniture that is meant to look retro. I ordered the scorpion (Giant volleyball sized drink) because I saw Bourdain order it himself and our group loved it. We (my wife and myself) got it blended with the ice cream and the couple we were with got it on the rocks. Both are very tasty but I'd have to go with ice cream variety. We order the Peppermill sampler which had cheese sticks, chicken fingers, shrimp, and bruschetta to name a few. It served its purpose and tasted good but nothing too standout about it. 
The service was on spot and great!! Peppermill's Fireside Lounge is a must stop if you're in the Vegas area. Great for pre/post parties or even being the main attraction. 
Here's my advice to the Peppermill owners- Keep up the great job and don't change a thing!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast here is as good as it gets, except for the wait!  They are organized and efficient, just have a lot of customers.

We scored two seats at the counter during our wait and realized that our seating included a \"free\" floor show .  Watching the kitchen cooks, expediter and servers was a course in discipline, control and efficiency.  It was a beautiful thing to watch.

My three eggs, cooked as ordered on a mound of delicious crisp homemade corned beef hash and a huge fresh bagel with cream cheese and strawberry jam was outstanding.  My wife's platter included eggs along with bacon, sausage, and French toast.  It's so good to be married to a slim women;  I helped finish everything and it was all to die for!

This is the Hash House A Go- Go (which I loved on previous visits & will return) without some of the showmanship.

If you want breakfast go to Denny's.  If you want a fabulous memorable breakfast make the Peppermill a must visit."}
{"text":"Neon lights and fake trees? You've won me for life. Throw in a simple lounge where Crystal is behind the bar blending up Chocolate Chip Cookie milkshake cocktails, I'm with you into the afterlife.

My first visit to Peppermill was in the morning after a long night. The wait is usually an hour plus on a weekend morning, so plan accordingly. In my case, planning accordingly means heading straight to the lounge and ordering a Bloody Mary. I don't want to say that Peppermill served up the best bloody I've had in Vegas so far, but I have to say that because it's true. Not too watery, just the right amount of spice, and that wor-chest-chire sauce, that nobody can really ever spell or say correctly, took it to a whole new level of tomato glory. Once our table was called, we finished our cocktails, grabbed our bucket of Coronas, and had breakfast. Eggs and bacon with an english muffin. Delish with a capital D and my perfect equation for curing a hangover.

My most recent adventure brought me back late night. Crystal was behind the bar again and mixed me up a blended cocktail called the Chocolate Chip Cookie. Heaven, dessert, however you want to describe it, it's darn good. Went for the Rueben at 12:30am and I'm so glad I did. The ratio of meat to sauerkraut was impressive. The last minute addition to order a random drink off the cocktail list based on the name you liked seemed like a great idea at the time. I opted for the Snuggler, a hot chocolate with Rumplemintz, which was tasty but wildly unnecessary at that hour. 

Peppermill, I'll see you again real soon."}
{"text":"Typical diner with typical prices and food.  Go if you're hungry for a lot of food late at night. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"A stand alone restaurant and not in any hotels with plenty of parking.  Travel back in time to old Vegas with super cheesy décor, neon lights, but hey it's all good.  Fashion repeats itself...  Enough about the looks, you'll see it for yourself.

The portion are decently large, but that didn't stop me from pouding my burger, fries and eating a handful more of sweet potato fries off my friend's plate.

The chicken focaccia is a pretty big hit, with pesto sauce, it's always a good time.  The chicken was so tender and I shouldn't be shocked, but it was tasty.  

The word is, the chocolate milk shake look enticing, but hardly worth the calories since it taste worse than Hershey's chocolate.

If you're a breakfast person, you can eat here anytime 24/7, as this joint serves it all.  

The worst service was the lone cocktail waitress that serves the entire restaurant was no where to be found, after 3 different waitresses requested for her to come by our booth.  If you want a drink, you just might have to find the bartender yourself.  

We went home with a free souvenier picture and the suckers we are, one of us spent $20 to get another photo =)  All in good fun!  A must try in Vegas if you have time to kill."}
{"text":"I ate there with a small group of friends for brunch on a Sunday morning. I will say that when one goes into the restaurant, one gets that retro feeling, and the ambiance like that makes the experience great. It is quite packed all the time, but one does not have to wait that long. 

It is a bit pricey, but it is worth the price since they do give great portions. Their regular order of a pancake is like three or four normal sized pancakes combined. It is HUGE. The food was great and I do recommend it for a great breakfast here."}
{"text":"Hello miami vice and pink neon! Was this once a strip club turned family dining? It is open 24hrs with a romantic fireside lounge. The portions are huge! You will pay about $11.95 for a breakfast dish, this is not an IHOP or Denny's style pricing. You will notice the inside decor looks like you are outside...i hope that made sense, since there was a tree right next to me at breakfast. I think I was more into the experience then the actual food, the taste was nothing special just average.

The Fireside Lounge I admit was a selling point. Very relaxing and had that Tony Montana (Scarface) vibe to it. I am singing \"I Ran\" by Flock of Seagulls right now. Great spot for a early morning grub session or late nightcap before bed."}
{"text":"Stopped in at this restaurant and was kind of thrown back some by the decor. It had a kind of 80s Miami dinner vibe with flamingos on the lights. 
The waitress was very friendly and attentive to our needs. The food was on par with most dinner foods I have visited. Portions were very large however. The burger and fries alone would be enough to split for two average adults. 
Biggest issue we encountered on our visit was girl in the booth behind us who obviously had entirely too much to drink. So what's a great idea?  How about you give her more to  drink. 5 minutes later the patron at the other table starts vomiting all over the table. No one helps her to the restroom or outside. They just sit there and watch her. But that's not the bad part. The bad part is they just left it there after she left. Someone came out to clean it up and refused to do clean it up. It sat there for nearly 25 mins before it was taken care of. No apology or anything."}
{"text":"The place is horrible. Nasty and trashy.  The service was terrible: super slow, rude, and unsensitive. I ordered a ciabatta pesto burger and a creme brule. The food was ok. Huge portions but nothing out of this world. I can get the same stuff  elsewhere. It's like a Deny's with neon lights. 

Expensive for the actual products you get. 

Our waitress took forever to take the order. I waited about 30 min to get an appetizer. Overall, the service was terrible (slow refills, waiter unreachable). I was so pissed that I didnt care to tip for service."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions and a great Bloody Mary to boot! We had the Crab Benedict, Ham steak and eggs (more than enough to share), and steak and eggs all around midnight and all excellent! The service is a little spotty but with the servers short skirts and nice smiles I guess I can live. Everyone was helpful and a little surprise when you least expect it never hurts."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here since I was a little girl. And it is excellent! Always has been! The breakfast is beyond compare! The wait was a little long, but well worth it.

The eggs are made exactly how I like them...every time I am here!  The hash browns are perfection and bacon is crisp yet juicy!  

Coffee...to die for!  I love the sugar-so whimsical!! 

It's hard to mess up breakfast food but it is perfect here,,,every time and with a packed house!"}
{"text":"This place was decent, the prices were reasonable for being on the end of the strip, the portions were very big and the food quality was pretty good! The service was the problem, my glass was empty waiting for a refill for 5-10 minutes.   The bill took forever to come and then took awhile for her to bring back the credit card, all while I watch all the girl servers huddled together just chatting!"}
{"text":"Good place for a family.  Nothing really amazingly exciting about it except that they serve breakfast all day.

Also, if you're a vegetarian, prepare to have a garden vegetable omelette regardless of the hour you choose to visit this restaurant.  This is really the reason for the lower stars - when oh when will restaurants to learn to cater to vegetarians?"}
{"text":"I guess every place in Las Vegas is expensive.  I'm not into the neon decor at all.  Just not me.  

The food was ok though.  Not from Vegas, so I'm not sure why there was one person for the water, one person for the food, and one person for the bar.  May have been a Nevada thing."}
{"text":"Very busy place at Breakfast Time, but worth the wait for a table. Our party of seven were all very happy with our breakfast meals.   The ambiance is cool, very colorful, like stepping back in time to the old lounge days of the Vegas Strip.  Comfortable couch seating and love the rainbow colored sugar on the table is a hoot.  The service is just so -so, not very friendly, but not rude either, just ok.  The portion sizes are HUGE as is the taste... the Omlets are perfectly cooked. the accompanying hash browns are delicious.. the Blueberry Muffin choice  is the way to go... they are amazing and the whipped butter that comes with is mouthwatering.  The Bacon is just the right amount of crispiness, the toast very nicely buttered.  The Waffle is outstanding, the best we've ever tasted! The Southern Fried Steak and Eggs is awesome.  Pricey but worth it and again the portion sizes are HUGE.  Will definitely come back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Now this is what food is all about! It's a fun environment, laden with neon lights and bustling with an army of wait staff in old school diner garb. But it's the food. Oh the food.

Not having visited before, and not having checked the Yelp reviews in advance (what can I say? we were on vacation!) I didn't know what to expect. We stopped in for some cold beers and an afternoon snack. We ordered the nachos, topped with beef. What we received was something the size of a small planet: a mountain of multi-colored chips topped with delicious beef chili, cheese, jalapenos, tomatoes, olives sour cream, guacamole. It was fabulous. And our snack was big enough that we didn't need dinner, and had plenty left to snack on all evening.

So we came back the next day, (why wouldn't we?), for a real dinner. We split a quesadilla and a steak and mushroom salad. Again, generously portioned and delicious. Steak was cooked perfectly and well-seasoned. Mushrooms, and blue cheese topped the salad and they were delicious. The quesadilla had a fresh pico on the inside and it was phenomenal.

You must try this place. And don't forget, you will be experiencing true Hollywood glamour: a scene from \"Casino\" was filmed here!"}
{"text":"Had 5 in our party and went around lunch time. Wait was about 20 mins, though they said it would be 45. However, the food took about that to get. Large portions. I had the ribs and they feel right off the bone. Didn't want to stop eating them. Food and service were good, food just took a little too long"}
{"text":"The Peppermill is ok for what it is. Thy have nice sized food portions and the food is pretty good. My only complaint is the Bloody Mary I ordered, it tasted like I was drinking straight tomato juice. No spice, no kick and I couldn't taste any alcohol. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, large portions, really cool lounge in the back... a real Las Vegas classic!"}
{"text":"LIke many others, I kept hearing about this place over & over again. Finally had a chance to visit on our last Vegas outting. Got there around 10am on a Friday morning & of course already packed but not too bad. Put our names in for a table for 4 & proceeded to the bar where they have some really good pay outs for video poker!? 

I had the chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, hash browns & sour dough toast. Amazing breakfast!!!! Everything tasted exceptionally well, great portions, not too over the top big but not skimpy by any means. 

I love breakfast I just don't eat it often so I don't visit many breakfast spots. But I have to say this place is just a \"well oiled machine\". 

This will be the regular spot from now on for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We are there 3 times while in Las Vegas last week. The Country Style Breakfast was great. Large portions and good food. It was the largest ham steak portion I've ever seen served to one person. The price was $15.95.  
The Ruben sandwich was disappointing. The meat was piled in the middle and there were only a few shreds of sauerkraut. The sandwich came cut diagonally and the bread was a swirled rye that was falling apart. The size of this sandwich was average. 
The food quality was good. 
Prices were high....very high."}
{"text":"This is an absolute MUST if you have people visiting Vegas! Heck, I'd come here all by my lonesome just for the cheeky eclectic lighting and huge portions! 

Peppermill is quintessentially Las Vegas :) It's open 24 hrs, and seemingly always packed.  Located on the north end of the strip, it's not the greatest location, but convenient enough and with ample parking. They make a mean sandwich, and supposedly have amazing banana bread! The service can be a little slow, but it was friendly none the less. What I love about this place, however, is all the neon lights and it's 50's diner quirk. There is also a bar attached that has a nice little indoor fire-pit that is soooo retro fun. It gets crowded so be ready for a wait or to sit at the counter."}
{"text":"The Peppermill restaurant has been around for such a long time and they know how Vegas locals and tourists like it. 

Portions here are so big, I think you pretty much have to split it with someone or be prepared to take it home. Prices are reasonable comparing it to the portions you get. 

The only downfall to this place which I feel doesn't take away from the rating is the long wait to get a table. Some suggestions are to call ahead, they are usually willing to put you on the list or hang out at the lounge and start out with cocktails. That's never a bad idea. 

We came here for breakfast and the omelettes were huge. Probably made with 8-10 eggs and full with ingredients in every bite. 

We will definitely comeback and bring lots of hungry friends."}
{"text":"Part diner and part lounge, it's 24 hours of fun and games with a mixed crowd sure to give you characters for stories.  It's doesn't look like it's been remodeled since the 70's, or at least, it's been made to look like it so that part of it's charm.

Food prices run a bit high but it's HUGE portions, 3-4 star in quality, and has a wide menu.

I like it for various reasons; food is only partial.  Good for late night."}
{"text":"This place is always packed. But with good reason. The food is always good and fresh. With it being packed you dont always get immed service. The female staff is dressed in an old vegas style with long evening gowns and dresses. They have a outside fireside area that is romantic and very nice. We go each year for 4 years now. The food is pretty good. A large variety menu."}
{"text":"I love to come here. The food is delish, great drinks. Great vibe. And the lounge is very relaxing and chill"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast & brunch spot near the strip. It's a local gem with a old school swanky vibe to it. You feel like you are in vegas movie filmed set when inside. The menu has endless options and serves huge portion sizes as well as breakfast 24/7. To the left upon  is the fireside is a great hangout date spot anytime of day"}
{"text":"How come out of all the times that I have been to Vegas I just now found this place!?!?  I had the Country Fried Steak, eggs and hashbrowns (more like homefries).  Everything was great, huge portion along with perfect service.  Open 24 hours but the wee hours of the morning are the best for people watching!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good joint if they could ever get a modified item right. No modifiers = great. Other than that the antiquated ordering system is screwing them on the food and beverage side. Must be rough for any changes for sure."}
{"text":"My family and I were on vacation and were suggested by many locals to try their breakfast food. It was already busy but we didn't have to wait long to be seated. In the waiting area there's some slot machines and a lounge area for 21 and over guests. It's really funky looking inside. Its like an old disco diner. Once seated, we had to wait a little more for our server to come to us. Once we were served the service was faster. I ordered the corn beef hash. It was sooooo oily I couldn't eat it. It was literally sitting in a pool of oil. The side bagel was probably the best thing I ate. 

I'd probably try this place again but not get the corn beef hash."}
{"text":"Fuck man, I love it here!  This is old Las Vegas at it's best.  I have never been in here when it's dead, there's always people traipsing in and out for their delicious breakfasts.  Plus, when you get there you're probably loaded.  So deciding to have breakfast in a place that looks like a strip club is an experience to be had.  Last time I was in Vegas, I stopped here for breakfast the second I got into town and was not disappointed.  I am not sure what anyone else got, but I also didn't care--I got their biscuit breakfast and it was awesome!  My time there was cut short cause my brother and sister got into a cab with a man that took them 15 miles out of Las Vegas and they needed to be rescued.  Of course, I made them wait to get picked up until I was done eating!"}
{"text":"I've never been to The Peppermill before so it was an experience. Very busy.
We had a big group of us,8 in all. A mini class reunion of sorts. 
Our server was nice but not very attentive. Coffees didn't get refilled and no creamer was brought to the table...ever.
The food  was good. Huge portions. I had to bring home half my meal. 
It was pretty busy but being Vegas they should be used to that so there's no leeway on that, sorry. 
Not sure I'll go again since there are so many choices here."}
{"text":"I love this place! I found the food to be average diner fare but the restaurant itself along with the fireside lounge is just amazing fun!

Food: as I said, average diner. The portions were big though and the food wasn't bad, it's just not the reason you come here really. Decent enough though. 

The main attraction is the restaurant decor itself. I LOVED IT! The restaurant is filled with cherry blossom trees all over the place with pretty branches of flowers hanging above you. Coupled with neon lights, this just makes a picturesque environment.

The Fireside Lounge was AWESOME! It's a separate room from the restaurant in the back. Dim mood lighting with pinkness everywhere! Big comfy pink couches with the cherry blossom trees overhead as well. Wish I was able to stay and grab a drink but we just had breakfast... Haha I'll definitely be back to enjoy this lounge. There's also a fireplace pit surrounded by water. So cool!! 

This is a great place with all the Vegas flair. Kindy tacky, kinda over the top, super themed, but so fun! I recommend everyone checking it out!"}
{"text":"Generous portions, I kinda wish I had ordered something else. The denver omelet wasn't so much an omlet as it is a really fluffy scramble condensed into the shape of an omlet. Mediocre has browns. Cool ambiance, hard working waitresses, interesting clientele. Be sure to check out the beautiful multi colored sugar!"}
{"text":"Wow. Nicest breakfast looking place with a bar lounge! We sat in the regular dining area, but would have been nice to eat in lounge area. 

Food: I got the alfredo fettuchine with shrimps and garlic bread. It was expensive, but delicious and big portion! It even comes with a side salad that was loaded with toppings like eggs and bacon. 

Drinks: I got a drink with sparkling wine in it with cinnamon and bitters. It was quite tasty! I also tried the mai tai, which was normal.

Someone goes around asking to take your picture and then asks if you want to buy it. But you do get a free picture preview.

Service is quick and friendly.

I want to try the breakfast food next time I come back to vegas."}
{"text":"Not a fan of diners but I can't get enough of this place. I always bring my friends there when they come to visit and everyone has a great experience. My favorite drink in Las Vegas is there (Champagne Cocktail, not on the menu anymore but you can still order it) and friends comment that it's some of the best crafted drinks they've ever had. Food is yummy and it's fun to kick back in the lounge and listen to cheesy music. I find excuses to go there! A must for a tourist and local."}
{"text":"I have been to the Fireside Lounge a few times now... The experience has been the same. Good atmosphere and good drinks, but the service it HORRIBLE. I took my family there last night who are visiting from out of town as I thought they would enjoy the atmosphere, but after an hour of waiting for two appetizers we ordered and asking where is our food.... We finally received our bill (already charged to my card as they had held it). Right after that we got the cheese plate we had ordered, with blocked cheese that looked like it came from Walmart! and the bbq chicken pizza.... Well it NEVER came, but was charged to my card nonetheless.

I asked to speak with a manager after, but she was rude and could care less, and as a resident of Las Vegas I am very disappointed that they treat my guests like that.

If you want to go here, my advice is this - eat first and bring a flask... You'll need it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a blast from the past but still fells modern.   The atmosphere reminds me of Pulp Fiction.  I feel like ordering a royale with cheese here and a $5 shake. They really do have a $5 shake here!!!   The food comes in large portions, enough to share, and will leave you filled for the day.  ALSo , its a great place to go for a late nigh snack or 4th meal. Good classic drinks from the bar too..."}
{"text":"Having endured the grossness (is that a word?) of the Riviera Hotel and Casino's facilities and food service next door, my brother and I ventured to the Peppermill every morning for breakfast over the course of a five day conference we were attending. 

The breakfast food is Denny's with a Vegas twist. The twist comes from the funky mirrored/neon interior and the short skirted waitresses. The food was more expensive than the breakfast buffet at the hotel next door, but the staff was friendlier and the food significantly better. If you are not staying in the northern end of the Strip it is not worth the effort to go out of your way for the Peppermill. If you happen to have the 'good' fortune to stay at the Riviera, plunk you food dollars at the Peppermill."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Whether your going to the lounge for an old time favorite drink or whether you are having breakfast in the diner portion.  I had a grasshopper the night we went and it was pretty yummy!  If your in Vegas this is a must do!  So glad some friends took us here, this will be a spot we will be sure not to miss next time we are in town."}
{"text":"In Vegas style, this is not your typical breakfast/brunch spot.  There is a separate area for the nightlife/lounge area.  For breakfast/lunch, you will enjoy sitting in comfy plush booths, decorated with tons of hanging baskets of foliage, and as other reviewers have said, HUGE portions.  You must try the brioche.  The servers were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the best place for a date night,  good service and affordable prices. They will definitely have my business again."}
{"text":"Great service, large portions, food was just ok! Walked here from The Wynn hotel (concierge recommended this place). I ordered the pancake meal which came with eggs, two sausage links and bacon. Nothing special about the pancakes, bacon was cold and chewy. I then asked for fresh bacon maybe a little more well done?  I received bacon that was microwaved so much it was almost black. Then I tried turkey sausage patties since I sent the bacon back. It was ok, I couldn't eat it. My server was Elisha, she was wonderful and so very helpful and accommodating!! Cool atmosphere and there was no wait when I got here. I feel like I should've just eaten breakfast at Tableau in my hotel. Maybe tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best color scheme in all of Vegas if not the entire west coast. I even think that there is a swatch palette named in honor of them. The food was solid and the portions were more than filling. However I passed on the fourth star because our waitress copped a bad attitude towards us 2/3 of the way through our meal for reasons I still can't figure out. Either way if you're planning on filling up before hitting the strip, or trying to kill a hangover this place is a great way to start/end your time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The experience was unique. Love the lights and the decor. The food was plentiful. Lots of food for a decent price. Our waiter did not make this a fun experience for us. He basically ignored us but the hostess did a great job greeting us and getting us our seats. I had the wings and my boyfriend had the Chicken Parmesan. I was pleased but he's a foodie and he wasn't pleased with the noodles on his plate. Overall good experience, we wanted to go back before we left town but didn't make it. Looking to make a trip back though."}
{"text":"Worst experience I found crab in my omelette which I'm allergic to manager refused to do anything about it and told me he has to charge me because I took more than 2 bites. The waitress messed up on my omelette 3 times before bringing it to the table as well. Nicholas ortho as a manager charged me full price for the bill and didn't offer to exchange it for something else he definitely shouldn't be running this place"}
{"text":"This is seriously one of those places that you just have to visit when you're in Vegas. The food is normally priced, the portions are enormous, and the decor is right out of my neon fantasies. 

Get the banana bread & take that back to your hotel for a snack later in the day. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I've been to the Peppermill quite a few times over the years. Usually for some late night grub after a night out on the strip. 

The food is ok, nothing amazing. Pretty standard cafe food. The portions are enormous so I often suggest sharing as an option. 

On this particular occasion I came just to sit with some friends and have a few drinks after work in the Fireside Lounge. This was actually my first time in that area of the restaurant. On previous trips I've usually had my fair share of drinks by the time I happened upon the restaurant. The lounge is actually really cool. It wasn't too busy and there were lots of cushy sofas to sit on around cool looking firepits. 

I ordered a diet soda (because I'm trying to be good on weekdays), but sampled some of my friend's Pineapple Upside Down martini, which was delicious! I look forward to another trip to this lounge for food and drinks."}
{"text":"Peppermill is a classic.  It's extremely ghetto & it hasn't been remodeled in decades.  But there's some charm in that, I suppose.  There used to be a Peppermill in Cupertino when I was younger and we frequented the establishment. Clearly, Cupertino was not a good fit for this type of restaurant but Vegas is just perfect!

On Saturday, we stopped by for brunch. We got there around noon and had to wait more than half an hour to get seated.  I ordered the burger (because I don't eat eggs) but quite a few people in my party ordered breakfast items.  Everyone (except one person) loved the food.  The portion size is huge!  

However, you have to be aware that a lot of shady things have occurred in those booths over the years so don't get too comfortable in there.  Also, the crowd is really mixed - from overweight chicks in tiny shorts to Asian gangsters to local families."}
{"text":"3 stars for a very nice decor inside, you can step back in time and experience the feel of old Vegas, but unfortunately the quality of the food has been lost. 
Place was very busy on Sunday morning. We had to wait 35 minutes to be seated. We had crab cake bene and eggs & hash brown. Crab cake was a bit smelly, and was kind a hard to enjoy. Eggs and hash brown were ok.  We also had chicken soup to start with and it was not hot, was warm, flavor was ok. Waffles was served with a corn syrup instead of maple syrup. What a let down. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and I always love it. The fun purple trees, waitresses in cocktail gowns, good food. I'll always love this place"}
{"text":"This is my one must go to spot when I visit Vegas. It has always been excellent food with large portions at a good price for years.  
I have had breakfast lunch and dinner here and it never disappoints.  
Funky chrome and purple neon decor adds to its charms.  
Friendly staff. 
It's a popular place so be prepared to wait during peak meal hours and weekends."}
{"text":"Feels like you stepped into Fear and Loathing's official warped diner. Had a solid steak with some shrimps on the side -- hit the spot. Decently priced considering how expensive most restaurants are around these parts - looking around at other dishes -- portions are massive. Open 24hrs is ideal for soaking up the booze consumed on the strip. Lounge area continues the vibe with a center piece fire on the water. Cocktails are good - bartenders didn't mind the few suggestive tweaks I asked for. Staff was friendly, accommodating, and quite easy on the eyes. Good spot for a solid meal and funky ambiance."}
{"text":"It is surreal in the best of ways.

Facing a grim flight after nearly a week of avoiding casinolands and focusing instead on the awesome climbing and desert hiking that the area contains, I was hesitant to go into a place that I'd imagined as a kind of cartoon of a Vegas cliche. I relented primarily because it looked a reliable redoubt against the desert heat.

Guess what?

It was a cartoon of a Vegas cliche on steroids and psychedelics and it is truly a worthwhile stop.

With cocktail servers who all look like they stepped from a TV commercial opposite Ricardo Montalban, a surreal decor that verily shouts 1970s pickup scene, and a fountain that shoots flames, the important thing here to note is that they serve cocktails in glasses bigger than my head (and I'm a bit macrocephalous), it has subsequently become my most ritualized stop in Las Vegas.

I can't speak for the restaurant side. Because I don't know why you wouldn't just stay in the lounge side."}
{"text":"The place to go in Vegas when you're tired of \"Vegas\".  Two words: Fireside Lounge. All that and Reno, too!"}
{"text":"Very big portions, open late night and very unique venue inside. There's trees in between booths! There's also the fireside lounge separate from the sit down restaurant side. Very well worth the money!"}
{"text":"I always had a fondness for The Peppermill.  For one, I grew up with one in the neighboring town and I spent a lot of time there in high school.  For two, it just exudes Vegas.

I will not be returning.

After getting our drinks and ordering my daughter's food, I witnessed a cockroach crawl across the table.

The waitress came over as I was standing up to leave, in shock, and I explained that a cockroach came over... my friend brushed it off the table... and I stomped on it.  I pointed to its carcass on the floor.  I was still putting my coat on when a manager came by and asked me to please stay.

She said they were sprayed the previous day and that they were assured they had no bugs.  She invited me to look at the kitchen to see how clean it is.  Then she moved us to a different table.  

I was really freaking out, but no one else in my party seemed to be bothered by the bug.  My daughter has mild OCD and I didn't want to exacerbate it, so I tried my best to not draw too much attention to the situation.  She was starving and it was almost bedtime so I allowed her to eat her pancake and we just stayed.  I know for certain if she was not there that I would have RUN out.

I tried my best to eat a couple bites of my food, but I was paranoid the entire time and could not eat.

Our bill was comped, as it should have been.  Still, I feel someone needs to take a look into this.  Restaurants just can't have cockroaches crawling across tables and still actually think they are clean, can they?"}
{"text":"Portions are large wether lunch or dinner. Service is very good.  Grab a drink around the fireplace in the bar to start."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The prices were good for the amount of food received. I would have given 5 stars but wait time to be seated on Sunday afternoon seemed long and service was a little slower due to having so many guests."}
{"text":"Your typical diner fare. We had a large family dinner at this location and it was OK. The manager was a bit abrasive when the reservation we made wasn't ready on time and I asked her about it. It's pretty far down strip, so not a great location. Food was fine - service was OK. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"The reason I decided to come here was because I read that the portions were huge. I was hoping to come here when my group of friends and I were super drunk and needed a midnight snack. We ended up coming here for dinner.

The portions are huge and the food was good, not amazing. Service was great too. The one thing I will remember and will go back for is the potato salad. I didn't order it, but my friend did as a side and rejected it because the waiter told him it was made with yogurt instead of mayo. I tried it and it was one of the best potato salads ever. That's the only reason why I gave this place 4 stars, otherwise it's ok. haha"}
{"text":"Love this place like Vegas royalty. The food is consistent and played with abundance.  Vegas is an expensive town and this place survived all the new places in the area with the best food for the buck."}
{"text":"I have visited the Peppermill a handful of times now. All at different times & days of the week being a local and all. I must say I like to come after a night out on the strip. It's convenient & good food. They serve breakfast all day which is a huge plus. I've had sandwiches & they always hook you up with the sides. Service really depends on how busy they are. What's nice is even if they are busy like we've had to wait 45 minutes, they have an intercom system so you don't miss your name."}
{"text":"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! Anytime we are in Vegas this is a must stop for us.  We love to go for breakfast and have never been disappointed! Everything is delicious and the service is awesome!! The place is fun to look at as well.  We are early birds and love that it is always open no matter the time."}
{"text":"My friend had heard not so good things about another one of these in Reno. So my friend at first was worried about coming here because she thought it would be a dump. We did have to walk through a sketchy part of the strip before we arrived...past the Wynn casino. We were both pleasantly surprised how nice it was inside and the service was top notch. I had read somewhere that this place was quintessential Vegas...and they were not kidding. Bright lights, booths, fire pits, 80's music, mirrors...and fake flower arrangements...it had it all!! We were also surprised that they had 1/2 price beer specials...so we took advantage of that and ordered some chicken quesadillas which were ok...on a pinch. This place has two sections btw...one is restaurant and one is bar...I can't speak of the restaurant because we kept to the bar side the whole night."}
{"text":"SLOWEST SERVICE EVER! It was ridiculous the wait we had for our late night meals. We ordered a nachos to share and then each had ordered a meal. The nachos came relatively quickly - and were pretty average - if not on the very greasy, heavy side. 
But we then waited, and waited, and waited for our meals to come - and by the time they did - we weren't hungry. We each had just a few bites of our meals and then just left. 
It's also located off the strip, so we found it difficult to get taxis to stop to get us back to our hotel.
This was a BAD decision! Not going back."}
{"text":"After midnight mass on Christmas eve we went in bypassing the restaurant going into the lounge...and while looking around there was plenty of seating at 2am but it looked and felt so comfortable. The drinks were large and good! We enjoyed the time we spent there catching up on the comfy couches, watching the food come out to others sitting around the fire pool looking very YUMMY! Just had to go back after a show down that way and tonight got to eat!!! Wow it was YUMMY....The chilcken quesidilla was packed full with a garlic marinated chicken that was so tasty, the nachos were red and green for Christmas and just covered with cheese, all warm and gooey and  all the accompaniments on the side like salsa, beans and sour cream topped it. Then the pulled pork sliders....well need I say more??? Really enjoyed it all!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Once seated we didn't have to wait long. Food is good, we had the Reuben sandwich which was the best we'd ever had. Good portions, and worth the 30 min wait."}
{"text":"The Peppermill is way far from the glitz and glamour of the strip; but it's def worth a trip for an any time of the day; gigantic cheap meal.

The dining experience will also take you back to old school style Vegas diner with the funky carpet and floral printed upholstery and indoor trees and string lights...

Yes. Definitely old school.

I did however; enjoy their food too.

Loved the French toast.. and my husband got some gigantic Scramble that just filled me up as soon as it was left on our table.

Great service."}
{"text":"Upon the recommendation of a friend, I knew I had to check out Peppermill, even if I was going solo.

This retro lounge really hit the spot. The fire pit is definitely special, though all the coves throughout the lounge make it an intimate spot or great for a group.

I went for the Blue Hawaiian with Grey Goose ($10.50), and it went down easy. No skimping on the alcohol.

I did find it a little weird that all the servers are wearing long, black, busty gowns, but they looked classier than at other places, for sure.

They played old, live music clips of 90's artists singing their biggest hits, like Jewel, Hootie, and Sheryl Crow. Again, a little odd, but pleasant."}
