{"text":"Awesome food! Great tea! Coffee is good if you like a lighter roast with a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this new place, but I was very disappointed. Enjoyed the environment, but that's about it. Drink was alright; however, the customer service was very poor, probably the worst service in the coffee shop industry. It didn't seem like they wanted to take my order. The two girls didn't greet me and were busy chatting about their personal life. I was standing there waiting for them to take my order. It was a very awkward experience at 8am. The customer experience I had ruined this place for me."}
{"text":"Just found my favourite coffee shop in Airdrie!  Love the beans from Rosso.  Goodbye Starbucks...."}
{"text":"We had been excited to go check it out.
Disappointing. 
If you scroll to the Jessica V review...I completely agree.
It is a good cafe on it's best days but no where near very good or great.

To be fair I was only there once and have never had dinner there or gone at night etc.

The staff attire is very casual (obviously a policy) but looks uninviting/unprofessional and, well, just way too casual for a food service.
It's a nice place but the people working are not always food safe. I saw nobody wash hands even after blatantly sneezing into hands over an entire half hour visit. Serving food with long hair or long loose beards. Food prep guys in the back (owners?) wearing fuzzy sweaters/hoodies no aprons or gloves. Milk sat out and open on the counter the entire half hour we were there walked past many times by all staff even when no customers. $17 for one coffee a london fog and two admittedly pretty good muffins is tolerable but on the high end for such mediocre service.
Based on a single half hour visit:
Nobody will talk to you at all. Nobody asks how things are, nobody greets you or says good bye etc. No little things. We wondered about many things such as some kind of special tea they had and food selections but just couldn't get the attention of any of the six people that seemed to be either working or in the ownership group. It's not like we tried hard but we felt ignored. Couple this with the ultra casual look and it all comes off as poor service imo.

The coffee in our order was handed to me half full \"the pot ran empty, but we will top you up later\". I had to go up myself later and wait in a short line to finally get the promised top up to compliment the bottom of the pot he just gave me *shrug*. My expectation would have been \"sorry sir but we are brewing a fresh pot, have this on the house while you wait and we will get your fresh cup out in a moment\". Just a suggestion.
We are in Airdrie a lot.
Maybe we'll try it again someday, but maybe not."}
{"text":"My family and I have frequented Sorso since they opened up this past year. The coffee is great & the treats and other food we have had there are also very yummy. The staff are friendly, although we are regulars now, so most of them know us :)  I will warn newcomers that it's definitely a small shop feel, so don't expect everything the second you order it (it's always worth the wait). Also good to know, they have a little kid friendly space to play as well as a meeting space that you can \"rent\" with all the proceeds going to Community Links, a great local support network. All I know is that being there as often as I am it's obvious the owner has been thoughtful about what he wanted for his shop, from the decor to the menu to how the shop functions for the community. This patron definitely appreciates it :)"}
{"text":"Sorso Coffe Co. - the embodiment of the modern coffee shop. 

Being a Calgary native, I am well versed in the coffee culture of YYC and its surrounding area. I have visited shops all over and constantly search for a place where I feel at home. Enter Sorso Coffee Co, the surprising addition to an already stacked coffee scene of Calgary and area. 

Sorso serves local, independent coffee and searches far and wide to feature 'guest roasts' from other small batch producers. Its so nice to be able to switch it up from the excellent house blend (from Rosso Coffee!) To another roast that I would never have had the chance to try. 

The food is all made in house from scratch and is very unique. The daily soup always hits the spot, unless its early in the day in which I highly recommend the breakfast options. If you find yourself looking for a place to relax at night, they serve a wonderful selection of wines and even draught beer. 

The ambiance is great and is a place where I find myself spending long hours studying, conversing, or just listening to the constantly updated music selections curated by the management team. 

Sorso is a wonderful surprise in the growing community of Airdrie that I constantly make the short 15min trek from Calgary to enjoy, and you should too."}
{"text":"Just a quick update: Sorso has gotten even better. I lasted reviewed them during the first week that they had opened. They were still working out the kinks! The decor is even better since I was last there. A bit of a hipster, industrial and rustic vibe to it.

I got to taste their food when I went last, and got tomato soup with grilled cheese. Damn it was good. The tomato soup was authentic, and reminded me of pasta sauce (in the \"fresh-tomato\" kind of way) and the grilled cheese was made on a panini press, so the crust was crunchy and delicious. I'll always go back as often as I can. Truly a unique and local gem in Airdrie."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place - it's got a real charm owing to some creative decorating, including a repurposed bar (very cool)

The Rosso coffee is great, and they make a mean breakfast sandwich aptly named the Mac Daddy, which comes 4 ways, my favourite being with their homemade sausage patty.  The egg is perfectly done, and comes with a tangy mayo that pairs nicely."}
{"text":"Food, menu and drinks were great, but the service was lacking. I had a pulled pork sandwich with the tomato soup, and my lunch date had a chicken quesadilla; both were delicious! Our server forgot to bring over our drinks for about 20 minutes, forgot the refills later... forgot we asked for no oni"}
{"text":"Wow, there's a vast array of reviews for this coffee shop! I had a great experience. I was heading back to Edmonton from Calgary and wanted a good latte.  The decor is great, there is plenty of seating, and the staff were friendly enough. The latte was made perfectly, and I even enjoyed one of the treats.  I don't know what some people are expecting when they come here, but I got exactly what I expected! Happy customer!"}
{"text":"I live very close to Sorso and love swinging by there for a quick coffee. Their food is delicious and they put a lot of care and attention into their menu.
I enjoy the staff, and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here with my mother in law for tea and breakfast! Absolutely the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had! I had the \"candy-bacon mac daddy\"  better then I could have ever imagined!! Their \"tamayo\" sauce is super good as well!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sorso a few times now, despite living in Calgary this coffee shop keeps me coming back every time I find myself north of the city for business. The Caf√© is warm and inviting with a modern-rustic atmosphere; highlights are the restored bar taken from a barn and some of the coolest light fixtures I have ever seen!

Their coffee is locally sourced from Rosso and they also offer premium guest batches from across Canada, both are great for those who appreciate more than your standard Tim's or Starbuck's brew. This theme extends to their beer selection, yup beer in a coffee shop; it doesn't get better than that! On my most recent visit they had an in-house beer sourced from a local brewery and beer sourced from Grizzly Paw in Canmore (Beaver Tail Raspberry on my last visit). They also had Guinness and Kronenbourg for people looking for a familiar premium beer. This \"locally sourced\" + \"international bests\" is a winning approach in my eyes. I also noticed they had a ton of teas from Calgary's own Tea House, although I haven't gotten around to trying any yet I do like the clear effort to partner with local businesses.

The food menu is constantly changing, with a good variety of sandwiches, wraps and desserts. I typically go with one of their feature sandwiches and the daily soup which has not disappointed on any occasion. The staff is always happy to take my order and answer any of my questions. I would definitely recommend stopping by next time you're in the area!

P.S. They have a cozy meeting room in the back that can sit 10-12 comfortably, great hidden secret for students and professionals who want to make their next group or team meeting a memorable one."}
{"text":"I was very surprised to read the review below. I go to Sorso daily because the coffee is the best in the city and does Tim Horton's even know what an americano is? The atmosphere is very warm and welcoming and the staff is extremely friendly. It's super funky in there and I appreciate that it's not a typical coffee shop. We actually specifically went for the cheese scones, which are delicious!!! And I personally love that it is a family friendly coffee shop with toys and a kids corner to keep the little ones occupied while their parents enjoy a delicious drink and snack! Two big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Sorso Coffee is a newer coffee shop in Airdrie, and I really enjoyed my breakfast here! The vibe is great, and I'm always for a coffee shop that turns into a bar in the evenings. It seems like a quality, quiet coffee shop that is a great place to hang. 

For food, I got one of their turkey/egg sandwich on an English muffin. It was a good size and very tasty. It came with a little garnish of orange, which was a nice touch. I wouldn't have minded if it were a little larger, but the taste was spot on. 

For coffee, I ordered a French press (perfect for a group). It made about 4 cups, which was great for our group. Not only was it practical, but the coffee was great too!

Since I haven't spent much time in Airdrie, I'm not sure if there are many other coffee shops around. Sorso seems to be top notch though, so if you're passing through and wondering if it's worth a stop, I'd say give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I do love this place! I find it to be a great addition to the city of Airdrie! No longer do we need to head into Calgary to grab a great cup of coffee. 

I love to meet my clients here and introduce them to the great pockets of independent businesses we have here in Airdrie. My only draw back is customer service, but it still has my heart for coffee, food and of course my favorite kombuchca! xo Sorso we all love you xo"}
{"text":"Coffee tastes amazing. I had the local honey latte and it was perfect. Tried the lavender honey macrons and they are delicious. Ambiance is nice and cozy especially on a rainy cold day."}
