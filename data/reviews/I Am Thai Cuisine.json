{"text":"This is one of my new favorites, they have a nice clean dining room with even better service. They never seem to disappoint with the food, whether I eat there, pick it up, or with delivery.. which I've done all. Delivery was so nice since I didn't want to drive in the wind, and showed up faster then expected. My personal favorite is the chicken pad Thai, with a medium spice..but be warned they don't play when it comes to spice, just like I like it. My boyfriend like the Mongolian beef, plus those potstickers are bomb dignity. We tried the wonton soup since we're not felling then best and it was pretty damn good. Can't wait to try some other things."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai restaurants in town  I recommend to stay under 5 on the spice level"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The food was wonderful, service was exceptional, & the prices are outstanding! Very clean and quiet. I'll be back again soon! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I am not from Vegas and didn't feel like leaving my hotel. I am a HUGE fan of curry. I decided to try this place. Their delivery was as stated online, about 45 minutes, but it came straight to my hotel door and was quick and easy. I also really enjoy non-fried spring rolls and this is where I felt they could have done better. The rolls were huge but basically just stuffed with lettuce. There were 2 shrimp in each roll (but placed towards the ends) thus the middle section was just lettuce. I only had one bite that had any cilantro so it had little flavor. The mass curry was good, although loaded with onions and had an expected amount of pork (you can choose which protein you want them to use - which is cool). I ordered it medium spicy and I was pleasantly surprised that it actually had a kick to it. If you are not a fan of spice then I would definitely order mild."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. We had our food delivered and it was perfect.  We had Shrimp Tom Yum soup, Thai Beef Salad, Spicy Basil Pork and for dessert Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango.  The flavors complemented each other.  The mango was sweet and the Sticky Rice tasty.  Would love to try dinning in next time."}
{"text":"This is ny favorite thai restaurant i order pork pad thai , green curry , fish cake and milk tea it was so good I can't believe it. Waitress ,location everything it's perfect."}
{"text":"Amazing food and outstanding service. We ordered red curry with chicken, veg curry and pineapple curry. Wait was 15 mins and all the dishes were delicious. Loved the Pineapple curry. The egg rolls were crunchy and full of flavors. Absolutely love with place. And don't forget there Thai tea.. yum yum!!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food with reasonable prices. It has a nice setting inside the restaurant. The servers are friendly. Yes I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ok just picked up my rental car (at the airport) and decided I needed Thai Food. AMAZING. We came here based on yelp reviews. We have been to so many Thai restaurants both here in Vegas and in Los Angeles. But this one has got to be one of my top five. Service was great..spoke to the owner who is so pleasant and humble. Turns out her husband is the chef! Bravo! Beef jerky was authentic, fried tofu crunchy and hot, Rad Nar was fresh, and Nam Tok was outstanding. This is a new place (opened for only 6 weeks ) and we wish them well. We will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Got the spicy eggplant with chicken( heat level 3). All I can say is awesome. Soo good. If you like eggplant get it."}
{"text":"This is my best thai restaurant ever. Spicy level 7 is really hot. Every foods we had were delicious."}
{"text":"Just after picking up a car at the airport, yelp sent us to the closet Thai place. We were tired and hungry. This place is great . We had Satay Chicken, fresh rolls, curry and cashew chicken.  All very good. Their  spice level is off the charts though. If you usually do 2, do 1."}
{"text":"I had some time to spare before going to a near by doctor's appointment so I was just driving around the area to see what was around. I saw this spot and was actually craving Thai so I decided to try it.   As soon as I walk in I was greeted by a woman and she seated me right away. I was the only customer in there but then I noticed two gentlemen across the room eating as well. The woman was very polite and got my drink and food order right in. I had ordered beef pad Thai level 6 spice. I had ordered a soda and I drank the first glass pretty fast because come on, it's 100 degrees outside now so I was pretty thirsty haha! The woman saw my glass becoming empty and she refilled it right away.   My pad Thai was brought out in short time and it was delicious. Portion was decent and I really enjoyed my lunch. What really made me want to do a review was because my drink was half empty and one of the gentlemen I saw eating across the room, looked over at me, got up and walked over to me and asked how everything was and if he can get me another refill. I was stunned. This man was on his lunch break probably and decided to do this nice gesture. And really I didn't mind waiting for the woman to come back later or anything.   Customer service was excellent, I was checked up on more than enough, and food is delicious. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just finished an enjoyable dinner. Tom Yung Shrimp coconut soup was delightful. And Pineapple Red Curry chicken was great. Great way to finish my trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"Great restaurant in an inconspicuous area plus very good prices. One note, this place does not joke about spice. Their scale is from 1-10 but 3 was more than enough for everyone that I dined with. We were all burning. If you're in the mood for Thai, check it out."}
{"text":"They served me a dry& hard chicken, too dry I almost choked. I returned it, the manager asked if I would like to order something else, I declined. Instead they offered me a half off price of a meal that I couldn't eat. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I had a 5 hr layover from Reno, with final destination to HONOLULU.  I was hungry and didn't want to splurge on airport food.  I thought instantly about looking at reviews. I love Thai food so when I came upon the reviews for Thai Kitchen, it looked so tempting.  I took an Uber (5 min from airport) and looked over the menu again.  I instantly gravitated to the fried red snapper with an apple slaw over it.  The waitress attempted to tell me everything was family style.  I let her know that I was hungry and it would be no problem.  The host and hostess was so cordial. Always paying attention to what I might want or need.  Well, when the fish came, it took less than 10 min to demolish that.  The outside of fish was crunchy yet the inside so moist.  The apple slaw with its sweet, yet savory back end complemented it so well.  Everything was gone (except the head) and I let them know that the chef did an awesome job on the fish.  It's a little hole in the wall with a great ambience. I'd make sure when I get in town that this will definitely be a go to each time.  Aloha 'Oi."}
{"text":"Good food.  I enjoy the Panang. I have been here a few times.  I am not giving 5 stars because I went there today and it took forever to get service.  The lady that waited on us didn't know that the person I was with spoke Thai.  She told another employee \"I have to hurry up and wait on these unhappy butt faces\".   It was funny to me but they should be careful what they say."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a 10, it would most definitely be a 10!!! GREAT customer service. Portions were bigger than I expected. If you like Thai iced tea, I recommend this place. I Am Thai Cuisine is my new favorite Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and the presentation is a work of art!  Simply amazing.  Decor is so so and the AC doesn't always work right.  One nice thing is the tables are not jammed on top of one another so it is a more private dining experience.  Beautiful food!!"}
{"text":"Out of town on Christmas Eve and this place was wonderful. So friendly. Quick service. Tasty food. Would happily visit again when we are in Vegas. Not terribly far from the strip, they are over by the outlet mall. We ordered some sate for our kids, which is their go to at Thai restaurants, and was a hit. Their pot stickers were beautiful and so tasty. I had never had them served this way with the sauces, normally they are with a sweet chili sauce at the places i visit, but I really liked their spin.   Wonderful visit. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"had the pot stickers and spicy basil! wowww.  I get Thai food everywhere I go. most are not this quality.  nice restaurant, owners and staff that care. very very clean.  would be a regular here if I lived here"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai. Very authentic and reasonably priced. Even they didn't mind that we were the last to arrive at 9:30pm for dining in."}
{"text":"The food is delish and the service is excellent. The staff is really friendly and the spring rolls are da bomb. The price is right and the location is close to the airport if you are a commuter craving Thai cuisine. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We celebrated Mother's Day here a few days early. The ladies were so accommodating and very polite. And the food...yes the food were delicious! We ordered pineapple fried rice, shrimp fried rice, chicken panang, mixed vegetables, chicken pad thai and fresh coconut juice.  Lovely presentation and exceptional flavor.  Everyone enjoyed their meals. We'll be back soon. BTW try the pineapple fried rice, just delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit this place was a little off the strip located in a secluded mall. But let me tell you that the food here is FABULOUS. I eat a lot of Thai food and let me tell you the food is authentic and reasonable. Must try the tom yum fried rice, pad kee moa, and dried beef with sticky rice. For four people with tip it was around $50. The service was attentive. I spoke to the manager and they said the restaurant has been there about 6 months. I want to wish them the best because I can't wait to return next year when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered a Pad Thai with chicken. It had too much oil and the chicken had the consistency of rubber. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Far and away exceeded my expectations.   I ordered through Eat24 for pick-up. The order took a little longer than I would have expected, but with this being the only flaw, I can overlook it.   I ordered the Pad Kee Mao (as I do at every Thai restaurant) with chicken, and I asked for very spicy. They knocked it out of the park. The spice level was high but not inedible. There was a good amount of chicken (not too much and not too little). I particularly enjoyed the carrots in it, which is not all that common in Thai noodles.  I would most definitely order from here again. I only wish it had been a little bigger, so I could eat more..."}
{"text":"I am so happy to finally stop at this place!  So many times drove by . Very friendly service.  Great menu . I ordered duck curry and it was awesome.  Lots of  meat,  not even one bone. Great flavor. Can not wait to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"First off let me just tell you that this is worth getting off the strip. It is a short drive but the atmosphere is super relaxing. That was a huge deal to me first. Second, the staff was unrelentingly helpful and extremely courteous.   Then this is where it got real for me and the person I was with. We noticed the level of detail that was being shown by how the food was presented. WE did not expect what we began to find out. The server who was taking care of us did have an accent and we inquired where. Native to Thailand, He and his family came over 15 years ago and finally have been able to live out there dream. His mother who is the primary cook is phenomenal. This is authentic stuff not the overly salty overly flavored junk you get other places. IT comes down to this, if you want the real deal come here its worth it."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Thai food and this place is always a good place to go. I work near the restaurant so it's very convenience for me to visit during lunch. I have been here couple times and I am pretty satisfied with the food so far. You must try the Pineapple fried rice!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! I've tried a number of items on the menu and each one was amazing! The staff is so kind and great! I've already been back 3 times!"}
{"text":"WOW, loved it. The food, service and the presentation was just awesome.  I will diffidently be back soon."}
{"text":"Seriously, the best Thai food I've had. Very fast, super friendly, oh sooooo good!  Pad Thai was better than most! The mango sticky rice was as good as it looked!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem close to the strip outlets and town square. Prices were decent and servings were plentiful. Child friendly and spacious restaurant"}
{"text":"Get here!!! If you love Thai...you can't miss this place. Staff is absolutely amazing and the food quality is superb. This hidden gem carries so many surprises. We celebrated my Moms Birthday here. Every single dish we ordered was made to perfection! We had Spicy Basil, Seafood Salad, pineapple fried rice, fried tofu, dumplings, beef and broccoli, pad Thai, cashew nut, curried salmon, coconut ice cream and mango stick rice! Wow- I'm telling you, everything was delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food & service! I am Thai and this is serious THAI FOOD!! I would recommend to anyone! Prices & portions are great too!"}
{"text":"I work right around the corner from this place so I decided to give it a try. I ordered Pad See Ew the first time with tofu. It was delicious. The fried noodles were soft and flavorful. There were also eggs and Chinese broccoli besides tofu. It was so good I had to order it again for a different day. For the second time, I got Pad See Eww with chicken and it was also good. The people at the front is very nice, food was quickly made and well packaged. Overall both times I've been there to get food to go were good experience. The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because they charge you $1 extra if you're paying with cards instead of cash on orders under $15. I've never had to pay that ridiculous fee anywhere else. So if you're coming here, make sure you bring cash!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Super friendly very near airport rental area come here to hang out and wait beautiful environment chill you can work charging near the seats."}
{"text":"The service was good, and we got our food at a decent time but the downfall was that we all got food poisoning from it. Just want to warn others."}
{"text":"This place was great! Were searching on Yelp for a place and we're so glad we stopped by. It's in a little place by a gas station..but was so cute inside!! They were nice and food was tasty!!"}
{"text":"Oooh man this place is to thai for !!!  After a day of shopping at the Outlet Mall, we were looking for some yummy comfort food.  I am Thai Cuisine popped up on Yelp so we made the short 7 minute drive here.    The staff is EXCEPTIONALLY nice.    The food is deeeelicious.  Here's what we ordered:  Pad see ew- perfect flavor!  Not too much or too little sauce, 'twas just right.  Light and delicious and flavorful and wonderful!  Fried rice- ono \m/  Yellow curry- loved how it had a little bit of spice.    Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Love the crab rangoon is crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. The food is delicious and it's nice to be able to order delivery through the GRUBHUB app!"}
{"text":"Not the best Thai food I've eaten but certainly not the worst. If you want really food Thai food go to Thai chili  in green valley. I am Thai is just meh in comparison food wise. I love food. Food is life. I am Thai is not life. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"So obviously I had a different experience, and it was lovely.  The presentation on these meals are so beautiful, you can tell that they put so much effort into their dishes!  Service was so much better this time around! She was absolutely lovely and was constantly on top of everything.  The chef came out and was so sweet, explained the rubber duck area, and it was so sweet.  (You should check it out, to know the answer ) they've changed the ambience from the last time I was there, and I'm thankful for it.  It changed it entirely, and I definitely think this is a place to go to! For a nice dinner, for a lovely date, it will cover all bases, and have amazing food in the process.  I'm glad they changed up a few things it made all the difference in the world and is appreciate.   Ooo real quick, on their specials board was the Tom yum fried rice... ummm omg that was awesome, it was spicy, and slightly salty, but you throw some lime on top (which they provide) and it's just, wow! Have that with some Thai ice tea, and you have an amazing meal... Mmm that sounds super amazing, I believe I'll be heading towards my leftovers now."}
{"text":"It's really good, good taste, good service, good price, good setting of the environment, clean and we have a very pleasant experience dining there. ^^   Recommend their duck fried rice! ^___^b"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! We really came to check out the food they serve in the pineapple (which was good) but everything else was yummy! The shrimp rice was the best I have to say. Definitely will come back when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"From out of town we were  looking for a Thai restaurant...we looked on yelp and this restaurant had 5 stars.  I see why the food is good.  I had the basil chili pork.  Spice 3 and it was so good.  My friend had pinapple rice spice 3 excellent.  Other friend. Had the cashew chicken number 3.  Very good.  Lots of food each of us had to take home.  The staff was so nice and had our food out f re sh.  Nice music in background.  Defiently try this place.."}
{"text":"Such a great find after shopping at the outlet mall.  We ordered 6 entrees, 2 appetizers, and a soup.  Everything was delicious, fresh and flavorful.  Family friendly and great for big groups."}
{"text":"Great place service was good real thai people and good tasting food. We went for a business trip near by and found this place was a nicely priced and the size of food was good u shoild really try the pineapple fried rice. As well the level of spicy is real thai dont try a 10 if your not up to get burn."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant!  We felt as if we were in a private home being served a Thai meal.  The service was so nice and helpful.  The food was super delicious!  We had six people in our party, and had a large variety of food.  Not one bad bite!  I'd say, my go to next time will be the Thai Beef Salad.  The beef was so tender, the salad was a nice mix of fresh greens and the dressing...YUM! Next time you're in Vegas, get off the strip, and get some really good Thai food!"}
{"text":"We discovered these fine folks after a recent stop at the south outlets. They've only been open for a couple months, so I hope you can show them some love.  Everything we had was perfectly prepared, presented, and delicious. Pot stickers, Tom kha gai, fresh coconut milk, Thai iced tea, massaman curry beef, sweet and sour seafood and mango sticky rice to finish it out, with leftovers for later.  We look forward to visiting again as often as we can!"}
{"text":"Just ordered take out online & it's going in the trash. Ordered panang curry \"mild\" & it's so spicy that I can't eat it...tastes like a 7 or 8. Ordered Thai ice tea \"no ice\" ha ha full of ice. Ordered Mongolian beef but \"where's the beef?\" two small slices."}
{"text":"The restaurant has nice modern decor. The service is a little slow, so I wouldn't advise coming here on a work lunch hour. The food was all very good. My friend had the lunch pad thai- heat level 2- and said it was excellent. The egg drop soup was the best she has tried in Las Vegas. I got the Chow Mien lunch plate - heat level 2. It was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Next time I will go up to a #3 heat level. My salad was good, and the dressing was yummy."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food at a good price.  Plus the new online ordering app is so easy to get delicious Thai cuisine right to my door!"}
{"text":"The massaman curry and spicy eggplant were amazing with really great flavor. The cucumber salad and Thai icetea were very good. The service was great and no drink at the table went dry. Try it! I think you will really enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Amazing flavors!  Ordered :   Papaya salad with sticky rice and BBQ chicken. Could have used more salad, but it's hard to find a place that gives hefty portions. Chicken was a bit stiff but the sauce on it was great ! Sticky rice was amazing ! Would def get more sticky rice.   Green curry with pork. Ordered level 7 Spice. They have 1-10 spice. Very spicy ! Loved it. They warned us it's spicier here than other Thai food. Be careful what spice # you order. :)  Would def go again to try other. Dishes.    Def a place to take a date on since it has atmosphere and it's very clean. Restaurant dine In prices. There are cheaper places to order to-go around town though."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest food I've ever had and the presentation is always great. Never overcrowded and service is always on point."}
{"text":"The place is simply decorated, small and peaceful.  The food was fresh and delicious.  The service was great and everyone was really nice, even close to closing time.  I wanted to try a new Thai place and this one just happened to catch my eye.  Really glad!  I will definitely have to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Their pad thai is AMAZING! I recommend it to anyone who goes. Make sure to get a some when you visit."}
{"text":"I live across town and every time my girlfriend and I are down in this area we make it a point to stop and grab food and a couple Thai teas! Great spot, give it a try"}
{"text":"Hidden gem is an overstatement from other yelpers. Good thai food, but not great. Sadly they ran of duck which is the reason why I wanted to come here. Chicken satay was kind of a joke. Very thin pieces. Pad thai was ok, very sticky. But the curry was very good and so was the crab fried rice. Thai tea was delicious, but sweet roti was eh. Service was great at the beginning but then very slow at the end waiting to get the check and it was not busy at all. Archi's takes the cake"}
{"text":"This place is super close to my husband office. Very intimate and yummy. Great service"}
{"text":"The best food I've ever tasted . The Thai fried rice is delicious .I come here every time I go to Vegas ."}
{"text":"Best Thai place in Vegas! Wonderful food, lovely people that work here. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I judge Thai restaurants by two things: Thom Kha soup and curry.  Both of these are coconut milk based, and can reveal a lot about a place.  It's easy to cut corners and water down recipes to save a few bucks (coconut milk is pricey, after all).  The good places will have rich, strong flavors in a thick and creamy coconut base.  On the other side of the spectrum, you'll find watery soup and bland curry.  You may have different criteria if you like seafood, or certain specialty dishes... but these two things have always been a very good barometer for me.  I'm very pleased to say that I Am Thai Cuisine exceeded my expectations!  The soup was delicious with large slices of intense ginger, chunks of lemongrass, and whole kaffir lime leaves.  Even more importantly, they didn't skimp on the protein (chicken, in this case).  I also like to see how they handle custom orders, so I requested the yellow curry lunch special without potatoes.  The server offered to substitute other veggies like broccoli and carrots... it was a nice touch, and showed their flexibility and desire to please their customers.  The curry was delicious and full of flavor, just how it should be.  Speaking of service, that's a key component of any good restaurant, and the staff here is great.  Fast, attentive, and very friendly.  I don't usually make a beeline from the airport to a restaurant, but in this case, it's well deserved.  This is definitely my regular Thai spot in LV!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I both had the lunch specials. I had this peppered steak and she had the chow mein. Egg rolls and service were excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food and the service was second to none. Would recommend to anyone. If you're in Las Vegas and would like Thai food, this is your place. Hands down. We are from Reno and we will be back without a doubt. Amazing impromptu experience! Thank you"}
{"text":"I am sad to give my first bad review. I waited forty minutes for my food. The servers never refilled my water or checked in on me except once--when they brought me the wrong food.  The salad was iceberg with a generic honey mustard. The lunch menu states that you get soup, egg roll, and a salad with your entree, but when I ordered, I was asked soup OR salad. I had ordered a yellow curry, but it was too sweet for me to finish.   I do give one star for the atmosphere, though. It is spacious and clean as are the restrooms.  The music is not too loud and the lighting is perfect--brightly lit for the dark wood atmosphere.  The other star is for the lunch price. It was $7.95.   I will give this place another try some time as I don't like to write things off based on one experience only. Hopefully my first time experience was just a fluke."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in the Vegas area! The staff here is just as wonderful as the delicious dishes they serve!"}
{"text":"Loved the food.. had panang curry , pineapple fried rice and fish... everything was tasty and in time. Service was good too."}
{"text":"This place was stupid good. I mean so so good. Excellent service and 10/5 stars for taste. I wish they were located closer to my home in California!"}
{"text":"This place was great!! Reasonable prices, good food, and they let you choose your spiciness level on a 10-point scale!"}
{"text":"While the food is terrific, their service is slow. I had put a large lunch order in for work and was told it would be ready in 30 minutes. When I arrived to pick up the order, I waited another 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I just ordered take out from here for the first time - and was pleasantly surprised. The chicken pad Thai was delicious and the customer service was friendly. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Great food! Lots of flavor and choices."}
{"text":"My husband and I have found our thai restaurant of choice when visiting Las Vegas. We dined at I Am Thai twice in two days and loved everything that we tried.   It was my dad's birthday and I was in search of a restaurant that could accommodate 24 people with one day notice. After contacting various restaurants, Joey of I Am Thai was the most responsive and helpful. He allowed us to create our own customized menus and provided exceptional pricing. We interacted via telephone call and text to make sure we were on the same page. I truly appreciate the time and help that was provided...  I Am Thai has your typical thai menu items; however, the authenticity and flavor of their dishes sets them aside. I'm talking about a whole other level. A few favorites are their crab fried rice, pineapple fried rice and pad thai.  Crab Fried Rice:  This was my favorite dish. Unlike other restaurants that use imitation crab, I Am Thai stuffs their fried rice with real crab chunks. They are not greedy with their crab either; there is a good amount inside the dish. The price is very reasonable considering the size of the dish and the real crab that they use. Delicious!!  Pineapple Fried Rice:  The presentation of this dish is already a plus. There is fried rice served inside of a full size pineapple (the remaining fried rice that didn't fit inside is served on side of pineapple). This fried rice was flavorful and sweet. It's like the juices of the pineapple penetrate into the fried rice. It's more on the sweeter end, but was a hit. You can definitely taste the pineapple flavor  Pad Thai: Perfectly cooked pad thai! We tried with chicken and another time with shrimp. I Am Thai is not greedy with their protein...they provide a very generous amount of meat (or tofu) of choice. We ordered a spice level of 3 and it was perfect for my taste buds. The spice was more than mild, but still manageable to eat for me (I can't handle too much spice without my nose running and lips burning).   Everyone enjoyed their meals and continued raving about the goodness of the crab and pineapple fried rice dishes (half favored the crab better and the other half favored the pineapple). Along with the excellent food, the customer service at I Am Thai is top notch. A+ all around...every employee that we interacted with was very pleasant and helpful!   We'll be back for sure!! Thank you again Joey and I Am Thai for a memorable bday luncheon for my dad!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Amazing food, amazing service! This will definitely be our new go to place for authentic Thai cuisine. My husband is Thai and said the beef jerky was mind blowing delicious. Mango and sticky rice for dessert was soo delicious! The plating is beautiful and quality of food is high. They are very welcoming and happy that you are eating there. Highly recommend and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"First time there today and I ordered to go. Unfortunately they were out of sticky rice today so I didn't get the mango sticky rice. I got chicken satay instead along with my crab fried rice. Service is great! The girls were super nice and sent my food to my car cuz I couldn't lock my car and had to wait in my car. Didn't expect that should've prepared some cash for tips. Food is good. They said their spiciness is more spicy than usual so I got my crab fried rice 5 instead of 7. It IS spicy but that was just what I was craving for. And it's really good. Will be back."}
{"text":"We had a party of seven - all of us eating here for the first time.  Two people in our party are vegan and one has severe allergies (to nuts, peanuts, and sesame).  Both the greeter and waitress were awesome!  Explaining to the waitress about the allergies, she wrote everything down so as to relay to the chef.  She made sure we all had plenty of water, with cold icy carafes on the table.  Our group ordered Veggie Pad Thai, Chicken Pad Thai, Veggie Fried rice, Veggie Lo Mein, Seafood Lo Mein, BBQ Chicken and rice, Mongolian Beef and Tom Kha.  EVERTHING was delicious.  Cooked perfectly.   I had the Tom Kha and have to say it was so yummy. The flavors were right on spot.   Shared at the end was a beautiful presentation of Mango Sticky Rice. Again - just right on spot and a perfect way to end the meal.   This will be a go back to for Thai.  I haven't had Thai this good in 6 years.  Something to consider - this restaurant doesn't use Thai chili powder or paste - they use fresh Thai pepper - it's HOT.  So when the waitress says their 5 is a 10 at other restaurants - believe her.  They will bring fresh Thai chili to the table if you need.  I had a 4 and it was plenty."}
{"text":"Off the bat, the food was great!!! We ordered broccorri, fresh rolls, pad see something, and fried rice with shrimp (skimpy on the shrimp).  Parking was available as it is located in a small shopping center. It also helped that we went an hour before closing.  THE SERVICE: 2.5 stars. Tara who appeared to be the greeter was kind and welcoming. We were a large group of 15 so I know it wasn't easy to take orders from four families, however when we called before hand, they said they could accommodate our large party. The waitress who took our offer was by far RUDE!!! Was in a rush to take everyone's order, skipped over guest who weren't which enough to order, and at some point she dropped her order slips and had the audacity to  literally SNATCH them out from a family member's hand who was courteous enough to help pick them up. Her attitude didn't change until I mentioned OUT LOUD that she was being RUDE.    It's sad, but service makes for half the dining experience and this place did not meet up to the courteous customer service expectations that a paying patron hopes for. Lucky for me, I was in great company with good food, which made the experience a lot more pleasurable."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Good service. But a bit small portion compare to other thai places I've been."}
{"text":"If I'm in town and I'm craving Thai food, this is THE place I will go for that!  From the service to the quality/taste of their food, everything was fantastic.  I tend to find some Thai dishes to be sweet but this was not the case at this restaurant.  My daughter, the picky eater that she is, even enjoyed the chicken satay and requested another order!  Staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I order delivery from them to my office. The food is on point, the delivery always beats the ETA, and the prices are good. My office is in kind of a funny spot and the first time they came out it was tricky to find, but it didn't take long. Now there's no problem. It might seem like an odd thing to point out, but all delivery people always have a lot of trouble with my office and I've had restaurants cancel because they couldn't find it. I Am Thai gives way better service."}
{"text":"Visiting we Yelped to find a some good Thai food, yelp showed 5 stars.  We figured it was a new place and gave it a shot.  The restaurant is in a small strip mall, plenty of parking.  Nicely decorated, soft instrumental music playing, Fountain bubbling.  We had great service and food was fabulous.  Large menu and you get to pick spice level.  I asked for a 5 which server told me it would be a 3 on their level.  She was so right, it was the perfect heat level.  The 3 of use loved our food and had plenty for lunch the next day.  Recommend you get the appetizer combo, pineapple rice, cashew chicken (not the name, but main ingredients).   I will be back on my next visit to LV.  We mentioned yelp when we got the check and they offered to make one of their appetizers to go with our doggy bags ..nice   reasonably priced.   Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Very delicious, melt in your mouth flavors, I cannot recommend this Thai place enough! I stopped in on a Thursday night, I.T was pretty slow which was great for me. The seating arrangement is pretty awkward but I was there for food. I had the Seafood Soup and the Pad Thai and both were above par! The customer service was some of the best in the business! Give it a try! Excellent"}
{"text":"The place was nice, their food is good. The only part I wasn't a fan of was the fishy taste of the shrimp mixed in the Sweet and Sour Thai Entree, I believe it wasn't cooked thoroughly."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorites, they have a nice clean dining room with even better service. They never seem to disappoint with the food, whether I eat there, pick it up, or with delivery.. which I've done all. Delivery was so nice since I didn't want to drive in the wind, and showed up faster then expected. My personal favorite is the chicken pad Thai, with a medium spice..but be warned they don't play when it comes to spice, just like I like it. My boyfriend like the Mongolian beef, plus those potstickers are bomb dignity. We tried the wonton soup since we're not feeling the best and it was pretty damn good. Can't wait to try some other things."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Yellow curry is amazing and so is the pineapple fried rice. Amazing service too!! We are quickly becoming regulars at this place"}
{"text":"We finally found the best Thai food in Las Vegas! This is so much better than anything else I've had here in town. We came in on a Sunday and it wasn't very crowded at all. The pad Thai was off the chain, and the green Curry fried rice was something we had never had before, and it blew us away. The staff was amazingly kind and helpful, drink glasses never got below half full. The duck fried rice is also amazing! Do yourself a favor and try this little mom-and-pop gem, you'll be back time and again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! Service was a little slow but we were a large party. We called them about 5 mins. ahead of time and by the time we got there they were expecting us. Definitely going again :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try a new Thai place and of course I Am Thai came up with great reviews, so we decided to give this place a shot and order Togo. We walk in and the atmosphere was good but dark, there was only one customer eating there, the lady at the desk wasn't very friendly and lacked a lot of customer service. If I would have met her before I placed my order I would have just left that place but I had ordered ahead of time through yelp... We ordered Sum Tum I Am and Tum Yum Noodles. Sum tum i am did not even look appetizing at all. The chicken was over cooked and hard with no flavoring to it what so ever. The rice was old, you can tell they froze the rice and microwaved it, and the papaya salad wasn't even that good it lacked a lot of flavoring just like the rest of the order. The tum tum noodles were horrible, it wasn't hot or sour, it just tasted bland. We'd give them 0 stars if we could."}
{"text":"I just had the best and spiciest pad thai in all of Las Vegas at I Am Thai. I will definitely be back many more times. The service was great, and the food was even better. Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I thought the chicken pad Thai would be really good but I didn't care for it at all I didn't like the taste of it at all , I also ordered the mangolian beef which was Just ok.... I might go back but after the way it tasted I don't think I will since there are plenty of other Thai restaurants that I feel do a good pad Thai"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem... Ordered $50 in carry out for myself and I'm 100% not mad about it lol... Everything was Delicious... Crab Rangoon, Shrimp Tom Yum, Pork Larb, aaand combination Beef & Tofu Pad Se Ewe... YASSS   The Staff there is honest about the spice levels, I was told that their 6 is like an American 8 so I ordered a 5 and my mouth was still on fire a couple bites into my Larb (thank goodness for the cabbage).  The restaurant itself is adorable so carry out or dine-in, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat,  My daughter and I come here frequently.  Service amazing, food is fantastic. I recommend the chicken satay! #we havent been back to archis#it's a must#delicious"}
{"text":"Was sitting in the cold winter with the Las Vegas breeze blowing in my face... I was overly waiting for my girl friend to pick me up, so I was freezing my tail off. I was also starving and felt of the need of some soup. The first thing that popped up in my head was some Tum Yum.... so I yelped some thai restaurants near me, and this place popped up. All the pictures looked amazing, so I felt more confident going here other than some other yelp experiences. And let me tell you....THIS PLACE DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!! I will definitely be coming back to try other dishes..."}
{"text":"prices are good - food is good. staff isn't rude - but isn't super friendly either."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. I came in after reading the reviews and was not disappointed, everything was delicious! We ordered Thai teas, and they were the best ever. Our waitress was very friendly and considerate, she gave me a good description of the green curry fried rice and I followed her recommendation on the spice level, which was perfect. My husband ordered the Thai sweet and spicy chicken and he loved it. Will definitely be back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Very good red chicken curry. A 5 is a little too spicy for me, considering that I usually ask for a 7. Initially, however, the spiciness tasted perfect.   Nice ambience. With the dim lighting, almost romantic.   $0.50 charge for credit/debit for orders less than $10 (or is it $15?).   Very clean restrooms.   Cheerful waitresses!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch and had the lunch curry. Fair price for good portion, and a 5 was actually spicey! They also have several vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Today I was looking for a place relatively close to the job where I could order delivery via the app, prepay, pickup and turn back around. I was impressed with the service on my pickup and my lunch was delicious! I ordered chicken pad-Thai (lunch portion- which also came with a spring roll) and it was delicious! Hit the spot actually! Definitely would come back again for takeout and maybe even bring a group for dine-in! You would never know about this spot while driving by, thanks to the other Yelpers for the reviews because they were right."}
{"text":"I have been to this location for pick up twice and each time food was delicious and service was quick and friendly.   Each time I ordered chicken Pad Thai and pot stickers and both times they were great (consistency is important to me!). They always welcome me with a friendly smile and offer candy to take with me. Hopefully one day i'll be willing to try something new on the menu but what i have had is already so good!"}
{"text":"The search for good Thai ends here!   Wow and yummmm....   spice is HOT!  I ordered to go and the lady told me to spice down (I usually order a 7), so I ordered spice 5 ( I need to go down one more....  ).    I had the spicy eggplant, cashew chicken, Tom yum soup, and crab ragoons.   I loved the egg plant and soup, my hubs loved the cashew chicken and crab ragoons!  Happy wife, happy husband,  happy life!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places in my neighborhood! Super cute decor and friendly service. My favorite is their rice dishes super flavorful!"}
{"text":"Update:  We had a wonderful experience.  They turned down the background music (at our request) which improved the ambience greatly.  We were a group of 8 and everyone was delighted with the food.  It is now one of my favorite Thai restaurants in LV.    Here is my original review posted shortly after the restaurant first opened:  We love Thai food and are always looking for new places.  Saw this one on Yelp and gave it a try.  The food was quite excellent.  I had vegetable soup and red curry.  Both were very tasty.  Be forewarned, \"medium\" really means \"spicy.\"  But really quite delicious.  My wife had Pad See Ewe (sp?) which she liked very much as well.  The service was also very good and the staff is quite friendly.  The prices are also very reasonable.  So, why not 5 stars? The elevator music was driving us nuts. It is pretty annoying.  The restaurant has only been open a few months so my hope is they'll fix it up a bit and maybe find some better music to play."}
{"text":"They had me when they asked if I wanted it vegan Very nice people working there and great vibes. Been there three times and it has always been great. My omni husband and cousins loved it. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"wow! want expecting much for delivery, but man this place is good! pad thai was amazing and the appetizer sampler was so good. might have to order daily while i'm here in Vegas for the week!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here. I would not have come in this direction if she didn't bring me but wherever you are it's worth the drive. It's a hidden gem.  Food is amazing and authentic. Portions are plentiful. Service is EXCELLENT. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Feel like for Thai foods in Vegas....  See what our community said about the local place...found this place.  In a strip mall...once inside the place is spacious and with Thai decor.    Sat down and ordered two lunch specials.    The red curry is average, ok.  The pad Thai is ok as well.  These is salad with egg roll. All ok.  This place is for the American taste.    It is ok for Vegas."}
{"text":"They have a creative menu. I love the sweet taste of the yellow chicken curry and the pad thai is delicious with shrimp! I have eaten here a couple of times and now will make sure to eat here more often. Affordable yummy thai food!! I would definitely recommend them to all!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It has become my go-to lunch place. I've never dined it, but the crowd is always decent during lunch hour. My food is always hot & fresh, never disappointing. Lunch Pad Thai is a great portion! I love spicy level 3/4, it has a nice kick to it. Spicy Level 4 with the red curry is perfect for me!  Thai Tea is alwaysss yummy!"}
{"text":"I loved it here good service and clean place. I ordered the Red Curry and it was a bit spicy for a number 2 level of spice, it was still really good but next time I'll order a 1. I also tried the Pad Thai and it was delicious! We had a party of 6, everyone ordered different things and they were all thrilled with their orders. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of their spice levels. I have trouble finding places that meet my spice needs. This definitely hit it right on the head."}
{"text":"Good food from a nice local place I never new existed!  Ordering again as we speak :)"}
{"text":"Really flavorful food and really great service.  A little spicy. I can handle heat but we ordered a level 1 and level 2 and still felt it was pretty spicy for such low levels. So if you can't handle spicy, for sure go for the lower levels."}
{"text":"I came here with family for dinner the day after Christmas. There weren't many other people in the restaurant but I'm guessing it's because it was so close to the holidays. For appetizers, we got the egg rolls and fried tofu. Both were really good and the presentation looked fancy. For my entree, I got the Spicy Eggplant and I chose a spice level of 3 since they said that's like an American 5. However, I didn't find it very spicy at all. In my opinion, it was closer to mild than actually spicy. They do give some chili sauce at the table though so I was able to add that. Next time, I'll request a higher number.   While the food was delicious (I ate the entire thing), the service was spotty. For some reason, we had two waitresses and when everyone got their food, my uncle was still waiting for his. We were already about a quarter of the way through our meal when he still hadn't gotten his order. One of the other waitresses (who hadn't brought us our food) came by to ask how everything was and we told her my uncle hadn't received his order. She looked confused like she had no idea that this had even happened. She went back to the kitchen and about 2 minutes later returned with his dish. I'm not sure if someone forgot about it or if the other girl forgot to bring it out but it wasn't the greatest experience for us since we had come for a family dinner and only one person was left without his meal through the majority of it.   Despite that, if you're looking for delicious Thai food in the area, this is a great place to go. All of us really enjoyed our meal and I would come back here. I just might come with fewer people so that the orders don't get too confusing for them."}
{"text":"To give y'all context, I am visiting Vegas. I'm not a local and am from socal. The only reason I'm giving this place a four stars is because of the musty smell in the restaurant. Once we got the yummy food, the smell was forgotten, so it wasn't extremely pungent, but it was definitely there. Hopefully they are just in the middle of fixing something as it can be off putting.  Regardless, we chose to come here due to the great reviews and we were not disappointed with the food or service.  Service was great. The servers were all friendly and promptly fulfilled our requests.  Food--the food came out in a timely manner and was all really delicious. We ordered: pad thai, pad see ew, pineapple fried rice, yellow curry, green curry fried rice, massaman curry, and spicy basil chicken. All dishes were very delicious--I personally have no complaints at all. We had a great meal and this is a great place to eat off the strip that's affordable. :)"}
{"text":"This was pretty decent. It's a little underwhelming atmosphere but the service was good. Potstickers I would pass on but the chicken pad Thai was pretty tasty and a good portion."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The food was probably 4 stars, but the friendly service gave it an additional star. I got Massaman curry with an 8 spice level. The server asked if I was sure, which made me want the 8 even more. It was quite spicy, but she offered me a chili sauce that they said was their specialty. It was good and she followed up with me. It was my wife's first time having curry and she enjoyed her 0 spice yellow curry as well."}
{"text":"A friend of mine asked me to meet him here for lunch one afternoon and it was great! Good veggies and healthy tasting thai food. Great service!~ I had the cashew chicken and it was amazing! I cannot wait until we go back!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food we've probably ever had. We came in as a party of 16, including 8 children and they were super accommodating. Very friendly staff and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Ambience is not so good but food is awesome .nobody can beat their authentic Thai food taste . Their spice level is higher than other restaurant so 5 spice level will be good if you love spicy food ."}
{"text":"I have try many Thai restaurants but this place is very awesome!! I want to highly recommend for everyone to have Pad-Thai and fried chicken fried rice. They were so good! Staffs are always nice and helpful. Next time if I have a chance to go back to Vegas again I am definitely go back 1000%"}
{"text":"I always look forward to eating here when visiting las vegas. I usually order some type of curry and the tom yum soup. always good. always good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I adore this place.  We come every two weeks and we eat everything on the menu!  We have yet to find a dish that we didn't like.  Our server, Mo, is amazing and attentive to his customers.  We love the dark interior, soft old school music,  and the decoration.  But most of all,  the service is exceptional.  Mo has a great sense of humor and always makes us feel welcomed, and he's super funny.  After a few visits,  he remembered us on a first name basis. Other than good Thai food,  what else could u ask for?  Thank u Mo!  Keep doing what you guys do, cause it keeps me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Wow! I am so happy that we have a world class Thai restaurant on this side of town. When I entered I noticed a very clean room with a nice fountain providing  a soothing background. I was greeted with a smiling face and promptly seated.  I had the Thai dumplings and they were scrumptious.  There were 5 in the order and served in a beautiful white oval shaped serving bowl with a lettuce leaf lightly drizzled in a peanut sauce.  For my main course I had the combination red curry ordered at spice level 5.  There was two medium sized shrimp that were sweet and spicy.  The beef and chicken were very well prepared and served in a beautiful serving platter with a bowl of rice.  The curry was very well done with a slight burn on the lips.  I may try spice level 6 next time.  For a drink I had the jasmine tea served in a large clear glass cup which I thought was unique.  I have a lot of favorite Thai restaurants in town and this one ranks near the top of my list.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing but our server was totally rude!! She has no business working with people!! She had a tattoo on the left side of her neck. I hate giving this place a low review but this lady was horrible!"}
{"text":"PS: flew in for work 11/13/2017, yelp says they close at 10 pm her actual time is 930 pm. Came straight from the airport and arrived at 940.  Recognized one of the workers leaving and asked if they were closed already. They closed at 930 and I hopped in my car to leave. He came up to the window and offered that I could grab a to-go order. Heck yeah! Love this place. Great service, excellent food.   Original review: Holy heck! Stumbled on to this place via Yelp reviews. What an amazing find! The outside of the place does it absolutely no justice. I almost didn't come in. It's in a strip mall, dark exterior, nothing bright or welcoming about it. I'm so glad I took the chance and came inside. The food and service are both exceptional. If I could give it eight stars instead of five, I would. Word of warning! Listen to the wait staff when they say their spice rating is spicier than most. Fabulous meal from start to finish!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the amazing flavor of a Thai restaurant delivered right to your door, this is the place for you. Many different flavors and plates to please all types of tongues. We were able to feed 4 people with 4 plates plus rice and sauces. This restaurant sure has a kick to heat the mouthes of all spice lovers. If you are looking for something with not as much heat, be sure to get the mild. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I prefer Thai sauces to be a bit thicker. Unfortunately the sauces here were a bit runny, but the bursts of flavor make up for it."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always go here during my lunch break. I have ordered multiple items off their menu (Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, Panang Curry, Fresh Spring Rolls, etc.) and they did not disappoint. The service is also super friendly. Would recommend this place to anyone craving Thai food!"}
{"text":"Visited a couple of days ago and would definitely recommend this if you're in the area.  The restaurant is clean, the servers are attentive, and the food had good flavor.  We tried the Tom Yum soup with shrimp, the bowl has 5-6 shrimp in it and a sweet flavored broth, Pad See Eiw with beef, and the Scallop Chu Chee.  We've had these dishes before at other restaurants but never the Scallop dish; the dish consisted of four seared scallops on a bed of noodles which resembled a creamy chow mein.  All in all a great meal and definitely a place we'd return to when we're in Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday after work and it was great! They give good sized portions for a reasonable price. We had the Thai bbq chicken and the yellow curry. Beware of the spicy levels because they make it hot. I got a 6 on s scale of 1-10 and my mouth was on fire considering I usually get an 8 at others places. Staff was nice and the place was pretty quiet. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went with wife and 2 friends. Nice ambiance, friendly servers. We shared the pineapple rice(very good) entrees of mongolian beef, spicy catfish, cashew nut with pork. Excellent portions and food very good. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food, knowledgeable and efficient service!  I have an acute seafood allergy and called ahead of time to discuss what I could eat if we decided to dine there.  Tara was extremely knowledgeable about all the options and made sure to follow up with the kitchen on all of my questions.  The food was fresh, tasty and well presented and the service was extremely attentive without being intrusive.  The Chicken Satay, Thai Beef Salad, Panang Chicken and Chicken Pad Thai were all done perfectly and we even had a second order of sticky rice which the kitchen did a great job of getting out quickly for us.  If you want great Thai food and equally great service I Am Thai is your place!  We live right around the corner and we'll be frequent visitors."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere. The service was very good. I had red curry. Their spicy scale was a bit off. Definitely more spicy than any place I have ever been at. I ordered a number three and I usually get a six. I prefer my curry more creamy with coconut milk"}
{"text":"Tom Kha is my favorite all time Thai meal. I ordered this, and Rad Nar noodle dish with beef. It came hot and I was excited to try a new thai place. WELL..not impressed. My soup had only a few pieces of chicken and barely any mushrooms. Wah. My boyfriend's noodle dish was only so-so, the noodles didn't seem fresh. Nonetheless we ate our food and thought it was ok.   Then this morning I am...diarrhea. And it wasn't from the bacon and eggs I ate yesterday, it had to be the Tom Kha. So pass on this place. The food is mediocre (if you want the BEST tom kha go to Pon Ocha, it's so far from my home but I'd drive there and back all day over this place) and I got a small case of food poisoning. :/ Case closed."}
{"text":"Although I previously rated 3 stars because of the portion of their items seemed to lessen, I am just going to have to update my review because they have definitely never let me down on the taste of their food. Their Lad Na has consistently been delicious. That is my definite go-to when it comes to Las Vegas Winter weather. Also, I love how the to-go utensils they give you, they provide the big soup spoon.. perfect for scooping all that delicious gravy! I'll continue to frequent this place as its so close to my work."}
{"text":"Found this place because I was staying near by and what good luck it was. The Shrimp Pad Thai was great. I had it made a spice level 3, and that was plenty for mere mortals. My buddy had the Green Curry and said it was fantastic as well.  It was empty when we walked in, so we were worried. As soon as the food came out, we knew others were just missing out. Do yourself a favor and go check this place out."}
{"text":"Good value. Clean restaurant and very friendly waitress had our toddler smiling.  The soup was good and yellow curry was well executed but quite spicy.  Loved the sticky rice ice cream and peanut dessert.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just over all great food and great customer service.   The larb was excellent, would definitely order that again."}
{"text":"I love this place, and it's so close to the airport, I stop by almost immediately I come to town."}
{"text":"This place was a great find! We came here for lunch. First all I do have to mention that the service was sloooooowwww probably because it was lunchtime but damn it was slow as hell.  If you check in, you get a free coke! No refills on Thai tea or Thai coffee.  The calamari was great presentation. There weren't a lot for something that was $7. It seemed to be over fried. It was okay. I wouldn't get it as the appetizer though.  So if you get the lunch special, it comes with soup and egg roll. It says it comes with salad but we never got it.  We got the pad Thai. It was good. I really liked it. It was the right amount of flavors and wasn't overpowering like other pad thais I've had. It's good with chicken.  The papaya salad was okay. It seemed to be missing something.   The Thai sweet and sour is something I would not recommend. It doesn't taste good. It's more sour than it is sweet. I don't know if it was the pork or something else but it tasted funky.  The red curry was amazing. I really enjoyed it! If you get it with a 4 spiciness, it is enough for someone that doesnt like too much spice but good enough for someone who loves spice. The ingredients worked well together and it was the right amount.   We had spicy basil. It was good. It wasn't the best I have to admit but it was good. There wasn't a lot of basil flavor and I think that's what made it just good.   I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem..  everything we ordered was Delicious! Very nice waitresses too"}
{"text":"Didn't get to snap any photos of the food because we ate it so fast  chicken skewers had a nice flavor the whatever dressing they put on top was great. Also got the chicken wonton soup which was full of flavor and veggies and onions. First time ever trying Thai curry and I was a huge fan and will be coming back for more! 3/10 on spice level and it was pretty hot I would probably do 2 or 1 next time. The waitresses warned me 3/10 is like 5/10 compared to other places and she wasn't lying. Really good quality food we will be coming back"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! My husband and I were in the mood for Thai food and we decided to give it a try.  The Thai egg rolls are perfectly crisp and full of so much flavor. Then we had pad Thai noodles and was so delicious as well. Cucumber salad was okay. And the staff was simply sweet and attentive. Definitely stopping by again soon!"}
{"text":"Compared to other thai restaurants that I've been to, this is by far my favorite. The place is very nice despite it being located in quite deserted area. Because of the location, it was actually empty when I came (or maybe because it was 9pm lol). The food presentation is on fleek and you can tell that they put a lot of effort into it. Their customer service was also spot on. I will definitely eat here next time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"So good! I ordered delivery because I prefer Thai food while watching Homeland in my underpants. My first experience was awesome. Quick, hot delivery and my food was delicious! I ordered the red curry and the steamed dumplings and it was all so, so good. My brown rice was perfect and I can't wait to try more of their items!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place after the good reviews and the fact that it was close to work.   I went here with a coworker. I was excited there was a lunch menu but bummed it was pretty limited. I was in the mood for seafood, so I ordered a squid salad off the regular menu. I asked for no spicy sauce and the waiter asked me if I wanted the dish spicy (didn't I just say no sauce?). When the entree came it was still covered in sauce (a tad spicy) and the squid was super tough. I could barely eat it but I didn't really feel like sending it back since I was short on time. I should have known better than to order it when it was the only squid entree on the menu.  Coworker got the chicken and broccoli and he described it as tasting like an \"expensive TV dinner\".    Also they charge .50 for a credit card transaction and they require it be at least $15. Yikes.   Overall I was hoping for a better close-to-work lunch spot, but I left disappointed."}
{"text":"We happened to stumbled upon this place because we were meeting people who live in the Silverado Ranch area. Everything was wonderful and very fresh. The waitress was polite and prompt as well. Caution: when choosing a spice level go down a notch from what you think you can handle! The only negative that wasn't really a negative is that the bill was written out in Thai so we were unable to figure out who ordered what when it was time to pay. We solved that problem by just splitting the bill in two. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered carry out for dinner tonight. Everything was hot and delicious. We got chow mein and fried rice with fried chicken for the kids (so no spice) and both were season great and the kids loved them. The spicy basil dish was by far my favorite. We ordered it spicy and it did not disappoint! Everyone had to get an extra glass of water. We will definitely be ordering here again."}
{"text":"We just found this gem. Love the food no I'm literally obsessed! Very clean, great service and good price. Everything we have gotten is delicious."}
{"text":"Good meal for a good price.  Staff was extremely polite and I liked the spacious interior."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! I don't understand how they are not busy. I am very picky with my Thai food especially with curry, they made it perfect down to the spice I like... which is SPICY! I will definitely be coming back as a usual & recommending this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Had the veggie only chow mien and it was delicious! Ordered it at a level 5 spice. Service was also great!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at almost every Thai restaurant in the city and this might be my family's favorite new spot. The food was phenomenal and the service was excellent. We are vegan, so we were kind of annoying with the modifications we made to our food, but they were extremely accommodating. My husband ordered something that wasn't even on the menu because he thought all Thai restaurants had this (edamame) and they made it for us! We like our food very spicy, and most places can't make it as spicy as we eat at home, but this restaurant made it EXACTLY how we like it. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"food are great! its a must try! if they are in a better localtion its going to be packed! try it before everyone are going there."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in a lot no time! Tom Yum, crab Rangoon and their pot stickers are to die for. Staff is so friendly. Love it!"}
{"text":"I am pretty finicky on my Pad Thai and this is delicious!  Be prepared! They are heavy on the heat! I got a level 6 and it was more like a 7+ elsewhere. Of course that could vary by Chef. But I typically get a 6 and a side of chili sauce to go up a notch. No need for it here!  It was still wonderful! The Thai Tea was really good as well!  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding and the service attentive. Even our picky eater was happy. Live across town, but will be returning here for our Thai food fix. The fresh rolls, pineapple fried rice, and Pad Thai...delicious! Even learned a new napkin fold technique."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch on a Monday afternoon. The restaurant was pretty empty around 1:45pm.  We ordered the shrimp rolls, two lunch specials and a coconut mango sticky rice for dessert.  Each lunch special comes with a soup (egg drop) or salad, along with rice and egg roll. Each special was $7.95. $1 more for shrimp. You are asked how spicy you would like your dish, on a scale from 1 to 10. I got 3 and my boyfriend got 5. He was sweating while he ate his red curry.  The food was good. The shrimp rolls were not over cooked or chewy. They came with a sweet chili sauce. Both lunch specials were about the size you'd expect, not too much but just enough. A great deal for under $10.  I wish they had served a Thai soup instead of eggs drop.  A note.. I did not see their health score posted. Perhaps I didn't look hard enough.  The food was good but it's nothing that I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Visiting town for spring break and popped into this gem. Came late but we were warmly greeted. Super friendly,  relaxing atmosphere and service. Had a simple meal of crab rangoon and wonton soup. Surprisingly,  delightfully flavorful and fresh! Highly recommend and we will be coming back again!  Ps. My husband had panang curry and asked for 6 level spicy which equals an 8 for Americans. He says it was excellently spicy and the best panang he's had."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a poor review, but we had a bad experience. We ordered delivery for New Year's Day, we requested most dishes mild and medium spice and 1 dish spicy because this place usually makes things a little more spicy than normal. Fair warning, I love spice! I make everything spicy! But when we got the food, the medium was SPICY and the spicy I couldn't even eat, my mouth was in pain, I had to drink milk and my skin around my lips turned red and splotchy like koolaid mouth! It became a dare to try the red curry and watch people freak out. It was unbearable. I had a bunch of guests and luckily I have 4 bathrooms because every one of them was occupied! Something went wrong, something wasn't good or cooked right or something because everyone got ill!! I thought it was just the spice level, but the next day I ate the last remaining mild dish and within 30 min, I too was in the bathroom again. Not a great New Years celebration."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. Food is great! Price is so fair. Relaxing atmosphere. And service is on point! What more can you ask for? This is my 2nd time here after discovering this place last week and i will for sure come back. Only thing I would say is the spice level is higher than normal so adjust accordingly. But now I know. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Extremely clean, beyond friendly, and ridiculously GOOD. Great prices too. This was seriously just an all over amazing experience. Everyone in our party LOVED their food and I have never seen a cleaner restaurant, honestly. They were so sweet, played with my kids and brought my toddler candy. We will eat here every time we come to visit!!"}
{"text":"In Vegas for the night and wanted Thai food in particular pineapple Curry or pad Thai and this place was close to the hotel. Based on Yelp reviews I stopped in. Very quiet on Monday night the place was a ghost town. Needless to say service was fantastic. I couldn't make my mind up and it's really cold outside so I ordered spring rolls and Tom Yum with shrimp (6 pieces) at medium spicy. Waitress asked if I had been there before to understand there spice level and since I had read reviews I was confident with medium spice. About 5 bites in the spice kicked in ( I love spicy and it was but not so much that it ruined the food) I loved the broth perfectly sweet and sour with a nice amount of mushrooms and nice plump shrimp."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant thanks to the help of yelp, and the reviews are absolutely true.  I was amazed at the flavors and the quality of the food.  We had the Pad Ke Mao, Green Curry and Spicy Basil.  Everything tasted great and the spices were going crazy.  It would have been hard to find this restaurant if you were not a local or using Yelp.  It is tucked away in a little strip mall.  You can tell that they take pride in the food that they cook and the service that they provide to their customers.  I am very glad that I have learned about I Am Thai Cuisine."}
{"text":"Guieuniely extremely surprised that such an authentic Thai restaurant is first of all, located here, and secondly, amazing flavor and variety.   If you're returning your rental car to LAS, this is the place to be. It's literally right across the street from the rental car center AND next to the gas station. So fill her up and them fill yourself up before heading out on your flight.   You wouldn't expect this quality and authenticity in this location. It's just a pretty dead strip mall, but I Am Thai is clearly located in the corner of the lot. You're greeted by a huge set of double wooden doors. Once you walk in, it's huge inside and super spacious. I love that the tables aren't slammed right next to each other and there's enough person space between you and the next table.   The staff was super friendly, especially on Christmas Eve! The menu was extensive and they had a good amount of pictures there too. You can tell that this place was legit and the staff spoke Thai as well. There are specials but we opted for the classic pineapple fried rice and pad see ew.   Luckily for us, this fried rice didn't have raisins in it! It came packed into a pineapple with a great flavor and decent amount of shrimp, and the rice that didn't fit, it came on another plate. The pad see ew was super delicious! Noodles were soft and not hard, jump packed with flavor and a good portion of protein!    Two entrees was a lot of food even to share, and I eat a lot! Oh, best part, when do you a Yelp checkin, you get a free Thai iced tea and that portion was huge for a free drink! In fact, they even tell you that your thai tea is free if you check in on Yelp!   Overall, I was super impressed by the food quality and the portions. It was a great vibe inside and definitely one for the books in terms of Thai food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is delicious always on point and they really make their stuff HOT. I'm a huge fan of spicy food but they let you know a number 3 is actually like a number 10 no exaggeration. Mango sticky rice is also the best I've tried! The reason I knocked off one star is because it's so overpriced I've been to other Thai places and they aren't as pricey."}
{"text":"Finally, a Thai food restaurant that has authentic great tasting food. Whenever I come in I am always greeted with pleasant smiles and quick customer service. The food is prepared quickly and the quality still stands; being rich in portion size and flavor!"}
{"text":"The Thai food is good . Was a little upset with the service,  my waiter couldn't describe any of their dishes , I mean AT ALL.   And she took my plate whislt I was still eating."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great lunch specials. Awesome service! And they Deliver!  Ordered the crab Rangoon which were very delicious and fresh. The Pad Thai was great and made to the perfect spiciness! Pork Red Curry was so tasty, the pork was so tender and delicious!  Lunch specials while dining in include soup or salad, and a Thai egg roll!"}
{"text":"You've got to try this place their food is so fresh and so good I just order from them last night they even said that they would deliver if it was 3 miles away which was great I ordered the spicy vegetables and my husband ordered pad Thai and we were vote both very pleased with the food very fresh I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. The food is fabulous and the pricing very reasonable. Although be warned, their medium spicy is equivalent to extra spicy in other places. They now have their liquor license which is nice."}
{"text":"Over-priced, small portions, bugs, nasty people run this place.  Very angry manager etc.  Food was way too oily as well,  Better places close by,"}
{"text":"Crab fried rice really good. Order it every time. Never disappointed. Thai tea is good. Scollop also good...Yummy. Many time ordered the Crab fried rice for delivery. Hmm. Still the same. Yummy. And the beef salad also really good!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go from here and I wasn't overly impressed especially given its high rating. The plus was that it was done exceptionally quick, but the food wasn't my favorite especially with so many other Thai options in the area I probably won't order again. I ordered the pad kee mao with tofu which was actually quite good and had amazing flavor. I'm giving the lower rating for my boyfriends dish, the pad see eiw because it was lacking in flavor and didn't really have any eggs in it compared to other places. We also got the tom yum soup which I again wasn't super impressed with."}
{"text":"I ordered the Yam Woon Sen salad w/ tofu substitute, spicy right off their website. 20 mins pick up time. First time there. Level 6 was chosen and it is a nice flavor of spice IF you take your time eating:) otherwise the after sting will burn. Overall delicious!"}
{"text":"On the plus side, the chicken was cooked well in both the cashew and basil chicken. We liked the proportion of meat to vegetables and the packing of the entrees minimized the chances of spilling.  The only two complaints are that the portion sizes were small and the heat in the basil chicken came from chili flakes that weren't sufficiently tied into the flavor of the dish. It tasted like they finished making the dish, then poured more chili flakes in to achieve the desired heat level."}
{"text":"As far as Thai goes it was pretty good. The service was excellent the only issue; it took way too long.  I ordered from the lunch menu as I'm here during my lunch break typically I expect longer than normal service time as I arrived at Noon. What I didn't expect was getting served an hour later at 1:10pm. I got my lunch plate before I got my soup. I understand the lunch hour is busy but if I'm ordering from the lunch menu I would assume it would be ready to go rather fast or at least faster than other items in the menu.   The food was excellent it tasted great I ordered the spicy basil lunch plate. I ordered a 5 on Spice level (1-10) and it was spicy. For spice lovers you will like this plate. It arrived with side portion of white rice and egg roll. Plenty of food for a grown male adult.  Besides the wait I will highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Presentation is key in fine dining but never expected in hard to find gems like I am Thai   Friendly owners on site and service was exceptional     as well as the food. Will be coming back for more soon."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! I stay at a nearby hotel when I work in Las Vegas and this place is always a dinner spot for me"}
{"text":"\"I can't feel my face when I eat Thai, but I love, but I love it\".    Chicken Yom Kae was awesome but I ordered it 5 out of 10 on the spicy chart and it melted my face off.  The waitress warned me but I figured that I could handle it.   Beef Pad Thai is phenomenal - again I was warned about spicy and said 5 out of 10.  It made the mouth numb. Re-ordered chicken yom kae but this time zero out of 10 on the spicy chart and really liked it. Wife got beef Pho 5 out of 10 and she added chili sauce but she likes it hot.  \"THATS WHAT SHE SAID!\"  Got a cold Thai green tea and it's very helpful with the face melting."}
{"text":"1st time. Pretty good pad kee mao. Will return for the tom yum noodle soup. Will bring friends."}
{"text":"The inside was clean and neatly decorated. I love the table setting and chopsticks. Very friendly staff here. They were nice and made sure to refill our drinks constantly. Food was excellent and delicious. I like how they give you a nice big amount of rice with your entrees. The food came out and it was very nicely presented. I loved this place. Everything was good."}
{"text":"Amazing! Hot basil chicken, ground to perfection! Hot basil noodles, Tom yum Kai, an appetizer sampler. Friendliest staff. Hidden away, but just off the strip and worth the short drive! Unless you can handle really spicy food, order a 3 or less!!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty but way too spicy.  The staff forgot to tell us that their spicy 5 is like American 8. We ordered 5 like we do in any other Thai place but it was spicy as hell."}
{"text":"A pretty disappointing experience. My husband and I decided to go based on the reviews. So they set the tables as people come in which is kind of weird since they don't have that many tables (the place is pretty big). The food was bland. Egg rolls were tasteless. Tom yum soup was weird. Lots of tomatoes and mushroom, on the sweet side, definitely not traditional Tom yum broth. Didn't care for it. The pad see yew was tasteless. Fried rice was good but that is kind of hard to mess up. We waited 30 minutes for our entrees. I really don't understand how this is a 5 star rated place. Much better Thai options in the valley."}
{"text":"Pad thai and eggplant dishes were very good. Portion size was generous and the prices were reasonable.  Only open 2 months. If we lived here we'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"Very tasty and authentic. We had the Massaman curry and Pineapple fried rice. Both were awesome and the portions were ample. Will definitely be back to try the the papaya salad and the noodles."}
{"text":"Place is really good, I find that dining off the strip in Vegas has always been awesome. So many great restaurants in Vegas and there is always parking!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas! Their level 5 is comparable to an 8-9 at other that places. We always order our food with level 8 because we love the extra kick! Other than their food, they have a pink milk tea that can be quite addicting. Atmosphere is quiet yet inviting. There is always someone that greets you at the door as you walk in.   The one thing I wish they had was papaya salad laos style. They're the first Thai restaurant that I've tried in Las Vegas that doesn't have it on their menu. Other than that, everything is delicious. Love love their chicken pad Thai and Thai fried rice!"}
{"text":"Great and really fresh Thai food. Had the wonton soup and it like no other wonton soup I've had before. It a little different than your typical Thai food. The chef is doing something right and making a name for himself. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So I found myself here because my normal Thai place was closed on Christmas (lucky Thai on Silverado Ranch) and since I am alone on Christmas I am going to indulge in my favorite foods no matter what: extra spicy drunken noodle, crab Rangoon, Thai tea, and mango sticky rice. :) what's better than that? So here I am, my scary movie selected from red box, my bottle of red wine, and my Thai food in its signature and ever so elegant stryofoam box... ready for my evening of selfishness and excess!   They say they are spicier than most places and they are right! Normally I get a 7 and it isn't spicy enough but this time at I Am Thai it is perfect. I love when things work out and when employees are honest (with a white girl no less) about spice level. They didn't look at me and say \"7 is too spicy. Well give you a 4\" Which has happened to me SO many times. Here, they were honest AND they gave me what I wanted.   So if you find yourself alone on Christmas, or just hungry for noodles and curry, head on down to I Am Thai. It is worth the trip for sure!"}
{"text":"This place blew my mind! I will be going back there again!  I would recommend the Pad Thai level 2, with the Chicken Tom Yum Soup level 3!"}
{"text":"What an absolutely delightful experience. Never expected to find small town hospitality like we did at this restaurant in the heart of Las Vegas. The food was amazing. Wish there was one closer to Kansas loved this experience. If you go you must try the Thai dumplings, trust me!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal dishes: crab fried rice and green papaya salad  The exterior building is very deceiving and is absolutely no indication of the fantastic food and service within. This restaurant is a hidden gem!   I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for a cheap and delicious Thai fix. Right upon entry, the service was very welcoming and genuine. My friend & I opted for lunch combos. I got the red curry and she got paid thai. The lunch portions are pretty generous for the low cost! Great for a student on a budget like me lol.  My friend enjoyed her dish very much. Seemed like your typical pad thai dish.  My red curry was tasty as well and had lots of veggies. However, I was kind of bummed because I tried to order a spice level 8 & the server would not let me. He said some people in the last week had sent back 4's and 5's for being too hot. I thought to myself \"wow, they must make their food really spicy here.\" So I settled for a 6 as he suggested, and it was not spicy at all -__- I had to dump in several spoons of chili paste to get any sort of kick. I appreciate him trying to watch out for me to not get something too spicy... but ya girl can handle the heat! I was almost offended that he doubted me so much LOL. At least I know next time to take it up a notch so that I can hopefully have a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service and superb food. Low-ball the spice number, which they'll warn you to do anyways."}
{"text":"Everything we got was delicious! The service was great! Our server Wilai was so sweet and very helpful with recommending items from the menu. We got a 5 on the spicy scale and that was spicy! She recommended a 3 but I was feeling tough. It was still delicious, but I will try a 3 the next time!"}
{"text":"Lots of parking Great service Food ok Clean inside Pretty inside Lots of space inside Prices resonable Pineapple fried rice and coconut shrimp better then expected. Green curry comes with choice of steamed or fried tofu."}
{"text":"Ordered the combination pad Thai at the spice level 6, nearly took my face off, it was so hot. Maybe someone can get the same level and tell me if I'm correct or just a lightweight when it comes to spicy food or both. Staff are very friendly and kept refilling my drink quickly to help me make it through. Atmosphere is relaxing. Definitely coming back and try the pad Thai at a level 3."}
{"text":"My familys first time here.. Everyone was so nice went in for a take out order.. All the food was so yummy we got the Pad Thai, Thai fried rice, Green Curry, Pepper steak, Massaman Curry and Papya salad.. It was hard to tell which was best because it was all so good.. Lots left over.. Will enjoy tomorrow at work too.. Highly recommended! Will return especially since it is right down our street.."}
{"text":"I lived in Bangkok for five years and have been searching for authentic Thai food, I have found what I've been looking for!! The fish cakes took me right back to Bkk and the crab fried rice is to die for. Everything I had was the very best along with outstanding service. The final touch was the coconut ice cream Thai style. Overall if you are looking for the real deal this is a must go restaurant. The best in Vegas and I live in Tampa...I'll be back as this is worth the trip! Great dining"}
{"text":"Search no more! I'm seriously very excited I found this place. This is authentic thai food. I visited Thailand last year and had the best duck curry I've ever tasted there, I've been searching for a place as good for a year.  This is it.   5 stars because it's everything I expect from a good thai restaurant. Relaxing environment, attentive service, and excellent food.  Boyfriend and I got the papaya salad, tom yum kung soup, pineapple fried rice, spicy beef salad, and duck curry. Everything was made to perfection. The food was full of aroma and flavor. If you like thai food, give this place a try. You won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"The location is in a non descript location next to a gas station. The inside is older but in a well kept condition. Now the good parts. The food was excellent for the price. Large portion and the right taste. The service was also excellent. Lots of refills and attentive service. Great gem. Will be back."}
{"text":"FABULOUS!!! We just ate dinner at I am Thai tonight and all of us loved it. While visiting Las Vegas for vacation, I decided to go to a Thai restaurant off the strip (Thai food is my favorite type of food-see other reviews by me). I chose this place because it had very good reviews and it certainly did not disappoint. Not only was the food very delicious, but what made it so great was the extremely friendly staff. It was a true pleasure to eat there because they were so nice. It was seven of us so we ordered a good amount of food. The waitress was very nice and honest when we asked if what we ordered was enough food. It wasn't an insane amount of food for seven but I thought it was just right. The portions are quite large so even though we did not order seven full entrees, it was enough. We ordered two small soups, tom yum shrimp and tom kha chicken. We also got papaya salad and thai dumplings as appetizers. For our main meal we got tofu pad thai (a choice of fried or steam tofu-I chose fried), chicken pad thai, pineapple fried rice (which is served in a pineapple!), and massaman curry with shrimp. For dessert we got fried banana with coconut ice cream. Everything was very very very delicious (see pictures for large portions and beautiful plating!) I would definitely recommend going here, if you are a tourist or a local. It is a great place with delicious food, friendly and inviting staff, and low prices."}
{"text":"We ordered via Yelp and was sad when we arrived 30 minutes later only to find out that the order had just been called in as we walked in. The gentleman assured us it would only be 10 minutes or so and our food would be ready so we sat and waited.   The food was good. My panang curry chicken was lacking. In what I wasn't sure. I am used to having green beans etc in it and to me it was more like regular curry. The spice level on my curry was perfect but the rest of my families was way over spiced considering I ordered it light spice.  The containers/ serving sizes were in the smaller side but was enough.   All in all the food and ease of pick up was good but nothing special. Not sure I would go out of my way again to pick it up and would order delivery from a closer to home establishment."}
{"text":"Very disappointing take out experience. We ordered via the yelp app and I drove to pick up the food out of our neighborhood because of the great yelp reviews.  Arrived 15 minutes after placing order. After checking in with the hostess/server, she said the food was almost ready and to have a seat. I was surprised that the food wasn't ready because I didn't order anything that typically takes a long time to prepare. Another 10 minutes of waiting and I received our food. There was only one table in the restaurant so I think they didn't start the order until I arrived.   It was empty but the dining room looked clean and nice, I thought if the food is good, we'll come back and dine in.   The food was very disappointing as well.  I'm a larb connoisseur, I order it at every Thai place we try. Unfortunately this was one of the worst ones I've had. It was way too sweet and did not have enough lime or citrus to make it a little sour and tangy the way it's normally prepared. The cabbage pieces were cut so thinly that you can't use them as a lettuce wrap but the pieces were too big for one bite. Awkward size. The larb was also prepared warm and I prefer cold or room temp but that's just my personal preference.   The steamed veggies were fine.  The basil fried rice with beef was also fine. The beef was tender and tasty. The green beans were crisp but the rice was over cooked and mushy.   The pad kee mao was forgettable and the noodles were overcooked.  Sad to say we won't be returning or ordering again."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. Good service. What they lack in attention to detail they more than make up for in friendliness. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We ordered basil fried rice, red curry and drunken noodles. The food here is amazing! The service was the fastest ever and people are hospitable!  I will strongly recommend this for anyone who is getting out of either the car rental place or the airport. Some of the best Thai food ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I had the pineapple curry and it was delicious. The service was great and it was a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent! What else can I say. Clean and casual. Dishes are presented beautifully and flavors are truly Thai. Portions are ample and pricing is reasonable. We will be returning.  You won't be disappointed visiting  this gem. The only thing missing is more patrons."}
{"text":"I ordered soft crab and shrimp pad thai. Soft crab had minor smell but wasvokay to eat. But pad Thai was overcooked. It was moosh. Not sure this is Vegas style but I miss the original Thai style."}
{"text":"Great new thai restaurant! And only a block from my job. My 3rd time there this week :)"}
{"text":"Yet again I was Amazed! The outside of this place does not do it justice! I was very hesitant but if you read my last couple review Thai cuisine is one of my all time favorites! The place is quite specious and the tables are not all clustered.  The menu is affordable and simple.  And the food was delicious.  Some times Thai can be greasy or oily bit here it was perfect. The sweet and savory combination nations of the curry and chicken and vegetable made all the difference. I'm not a frequent LV visitor but will come back and hit this spot again!"}
{"text":"Ordered Thai for the family. Food arrived still at a good temperature. Order was correct. Food was tasty and which we all enjoyed. Our complaint was that we paid extra for the brown rice and they didn't fill the container completely like they did with the white rice. Why charge more and not provide a full serving like the white rice? Wife wasn't happy."}
{"text":"The place hits me unlike any other Thai restaurants I've been to. The food tastes great, the presentation was impressive, and the service was awesome.  I had Panang Curry, Tom Yum Soup w/ Shrimp, and beef jerky.  The curry was definitely flavorful, enough spice and sweetness to balance out the salt, goes great with rice. Tom Yum Soup was a little sourer than the ones I've had before, which I found to be surprisingly good.  Beef Jerky was something new and different to me, it was tender, a bit chewy, but not the kind of overcooked meat that only gets bigger in your mouth as you chew. Flavorful by itself, and with the sauce it comes with, even better!  Would definitely come back again just to try out other things."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food outside of Thailand. Grab prices and gray food.  Dining area is a bit small,  but it is great find. I have done cooking classes and took several trips to Thailand, I am usually disappointed by food here in the states.  Glad I found this place."}
{"text":"We ordered the following for take out:  Pineapple curry- very delicious. Would eat again. Panang curry- the portion was very small and it was very spicy. Pad see ew- better than the pad thai but the noodles were very dry. I don't know if they sat for a while or what.  Pad thai- also super dry and almost a little too sweet.  I've had the two noodle dishes at other places before and while I know that they're not supposed to be super saucy I do expect a light coating of sauce on the noodles. These were bone dry. When we got there to pick up our order was ready except for the panang curry so maybe while they waited for that the noodles got dry.   Another thing I didn't like was that they give regular steamed white rice instead of jasmine rice with the curry dishes. That was kind of a let down.   I would definitely try them again though. I'm sure they're much better when you dine in."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch prior to a flight. This is very close to the car rental center. The service was quick and friendly. The menu is standard for a Thai restaurant. The lunch specials are well priced at $7.95 including a main dish, soup or salad, and small egg roll. The spicy basil (I got chicken) was very good. The egg drop soup was ok. Thai iced tea also very good. Just be warned that he medium spicy was making me cry, and I really like spicy food. So it will probably come out spicier than you think! Parking is easy in a lot out front."}
{"text":"Ordered take out 20 mins before close and they honored it. The Pad Thai was delicious and pad see. The egg rolls were ok. The only thing I would mention is that the spicy level is a little more spicier than other Thai places."}
{"text":"Picked this spot randomly and did not regret. It is one if the best thai restaurant I have eaten at. The customer service itself is 5stars. Very nice and patient. Going to come back tomorrow for 2nds before leaving Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I'am new to Vegas from, San Francisco....this is the second Thai Resturant I've been too here,... It's gonna be my to go spot! Great food, amazing, and, friendly stuff."}
{"text":"Ordered 6 different entrees with appetizers.  The fresh rolls were loaded with mostly lettuce.  Every entree was very bland and watered down.  The beef tasted like cardboard.  The server brought out only enough rice for two entrees and then I had to request rice for the rest.  Overall, I have had better Thai food elsewhere.  Just bland and not authentic for my taste."}
{"text":"5 stars service! Food is on the sweet side but not bad. Drinks are big and sweet as well.  In general my whole family enjoyed this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent find as I was walking down the street, thank you Yelp. I had the spring rolls and a red curry. Both were excellent. I left with a good sweat on and a full belly. I'll be back. The staff were friendly and always kept my coke full."}
{"text":"I have only gotten take out at I Am Thai and I have never really sat down and dined there. It's really close to work so whenever I am craving some Thai food for lunch, I would order it from here.   I've gotten to try their pad kee mao aka drunken noodles, red curry, basil fried rice, pineapple curry, pad thai, etc. Everything was always pretty good.  Their pad kee mao is inconsistent though. Sometimes, it's great. Other times, it's overcooked and a little burnt. Their basil fried rice is delicious but their rice is a little mushy. I kind of wished their rice was more firm. But the flavors are fantastic. I love their pineapple curry! It has great flavors to it.   Their spice levels aren't something to joke about. If you can't eat spicy then beware. I've gotten a 10 before and it wasn't too bad. However, their levels are a little different when you order on yelp. I've ordered a \"spicy\" on Yelp and it was reallly spicy. I loved it but if you'd have to be able to take a 10 to take that. Their medium is perfect. It still has kick but it doesn't kill you.   Also, huge portions."}
{"text":"I had a great experience this evening. The staff was excellent, who kept checking on us and didn't let our drinks go dry. The food was spectacular and my friend I and felt like it was a nice, clean place. The napkins even had been setup fancy. Their Spicy basil was pretty good. They do mean it when they say their stuff is spicier than other places. I'll be back for sure. Overall great experience, atmosphere, staff, and food. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Really easy to order off the menu. Restaurants very clean with quick efficient staff. Our party had three entrées and one appetizer.  The stand out dish was the deep fried softshell crab. It was served with two sauces, a sweet chili sauce and a spicy mayonnaise sauce that fit perfect with the crispy crab. Barbecue Thai chicken was very good as well and full of flavor. It really didn't need the spicy sweet chili sauce that was served on the side. Ginger chicken was also very good. It kind of reminded me of a Thai style chop suey.  Really worth the visit I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. I've only been here once and I can't wait to go back. I ordered the Pad Woon Sen, it was very flavorful and the glass noodles not only looked pretty cool, but were just as tasty. Paired with a Thai tea, my meal was delicious. But beware of the spice level you request, it can sound deceiving!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in a long time. We ordered the yellow tofu curry, pineapple fried rice, and veggie pad Thai. Excellent flavor. Sever was prompt and happy to help us with questions regarding our orders. Will definitely be returning! Highly recommend the yellow curry!!"}
{"text":"Overall we were disappointed given the high Yelp ratings. Will not come back next time we are in the area.  Liked: - All water containers are made of glass. - Pad Thai tasted good.  Disliked: - Service was very slow for no good reason. The table near ours got their food much faster. - Red Curry with level 1 spicy (mild) was similar to level 3+ at other Thai places. The portion is small too. - There were suspicious residuals in our water cups before we drank it."}
{"text":"This place was great!! Had the most amazing Nom Tuk.  Oredered level8 spice and it was hot!!! But oh so delicious.  Also had some Panang curry and brown rice and it was also delish."}
{"text":"We obviously did a yelp as we typically do and found this restaurant, which supposedly had a 5 rating. Well I would say a 5, really is a 4. The ambiance was nice and the service was very good. The food was good, not excellent. We had Crispy Fish with Curry, that was good and curry very flavorful. Had the Tom Gak Coconut soup, a bit salty, however flavorful with fresh mushrooms. I had the drunken noodles, which they call Pad Kee Mou, very different from what I've had before but good. If your in the area, a good place to go. I prefer Arawan or Ni-tai-yas"}
{"text":"I mistakenly rated this restaurant \"One Star\". They deserve a Five Star rating!  Please see my original review - the commentary says it all. Highly recommended.   We will come back here the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"To me, this place does not live up to its rating. I've been here twice, months apart and unfortunately it was the same experience,  nothing special.  The only reason we stopped by again? Because we were in the area, looking for Thai and I had bookmarked this place, but forgot we'd already been and remembered as soon as we pulled up, the prior experience. We were too hungry to go somewhere else so we tried it again.  Both times we came after a lunch rush, about 1p. And both times, the restaurant was clearing out, but we had to wait for a table to be cleaned. I can't imagine what it would be like during the actual lunch rush because ALL the tables still had dirty dishes on them for a good  while. And a table only got cleaned when new customers came in. Nobody was manning the front desk this time, so a couple actually walked out tired of waiting to be seated? There were 2 servers/waitresses and 1 cook who kept coming out of the kitchen. I made a comment to our server that they must've been busy, and she said they were short one because they called in sick. Hmm was that the same reason last time too? The tables did eventually get cleared    Now for the food. I don't think this was authentic thai. The flavors of the lime, basil, fish sauce, palm sugar, Thai pepper, basil were not there at all. We've tried the Thai egg rolls, papaya salad, larb,  tofu basil , the basic dishes and I was not a fan, there are far better Thai restaurants around, sadly this isn't one of them.  Extra star for effort on our server who was very pleasant."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Las Vegas (I go to LV monthly to visit family and every time!  I order from I am Thai- I've never actually been to their restaurant).    Ultimate favorite is their glass noodle dish (sorry I don't know the Thai name) but it is fantastic!  Flavorful and fresh (though not sure if it's healthy- who cares?).  Their Panang beef is superb as well (another favorite).  I once ordered 6 dishes from here (phad Thai, assorted fried rice, basil chicken and I can't remember what else).  Everything was great.  Be careful though..mild spicy is actually medium to hot spicy...so don't be a hero!"}
{"text":"This is a solid Thai restaurant.  I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken.  It was good and the service is very accommodating.  Any local or out of towner should visit this place."}
{"text":"After a second visit, I must honestly say how incredibly good this food is. The Yom Yum soup, Pad Kee Mao, spicy basil fried rice, and the garlic pepper stir fry are all outstanding dishes. I must also mention that the staff are very warm, friend, accommodating, and helpful. Great customer service is always appreciated along with great food!"}
{"text":"tried this place on a whim while in vegas.it had been a long day, Thai food sounded delicious at the moment, and the reviews had promised good things. The interior seemed a lot bigger than the dining area, but it was a clean and well set up. My lady and I had the duck curry, a soup that I do not recall the name of and a pork noodle dish. The food was delicious. We had no problems with any of it. my first time with duck was a great one. We did run into the standard problem every Asian restaurant is that they never give you enough rice. And given how cheap and easy it is to make, you would think that  Asian restaurants would pass out rice like Mexican restaurants pass out tortilla chips. So the food was good and the prices were good too. I think we each payed $15 between the two of us for the meal. I would not mind revisiting this place next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Great food at a fair price. The check-in was an added bonus. Their egg rolls are the best I've had.  Update: still coming here regularly and it's always good!"}
{"text":"I feel the burn! if you like spicy this place will not fall you. fyi, 'not spicy' still has a kick to it. overall, loved the service & food. I shall return! and their Thai tea is delicious as well."}
{"text":"I have eaten at most Thai restaurants in the surrounding area and this is by far the best. In fact it's the best Thai place I've eaten at in Las Vegas. Their Pad Thai and Larb are probably the best things I've had. And I've eaten quite a few dishes here. Now this place is spicy. They do warn you if it's your first time coming here. They aren't joking. At other Thai places I can eat a 7 or 8 no problem here I get like a 4 or 5. But the spice is great tasting and isn't just hot with no flavor. Eat here. You won't regret it....unless you make your dish too spicy."}
{"text":"I just love their dishes and my favorite is the pad see ew. It's just nice place to seat down and eat and the stuff is always so friendly and nice. One of my favorite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here after EDC with a group of friends and did family style. Food was good and portions are HUGE!  I think pretty much everything we got tasted good. The only thing I thought wasn't worth ordering was the chicken satay.  5 stars: crab fried rice 4 stars: pad thai  5 stars: spicy eggplant with pork  4 stars: green curry  4 stars: glass noodle salad   I can't stress enough how generous each dish was in terms of size, definitely worth the $$! Our waitress was also very nice. Don't forget to check in on yelp for free drink too. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Hands down, the best Thai restaurant we've eaten at in Las Vegas. There spice levels are correct. There Spice level 8 is exactly what you think it should be. Not like most places where a 10 taste like a 4.   I have literally never had a bad meal here. Papaya salad - delicious, pad thai - the right balance, not to sweet or saucy just right, pad see ew - simple great, spicy bail chicken is ridiculously good, tom yum fried rice is one of those special dishes that you have to really question if fried rice can really be so good..   This is a small business and there foods is exceptionally great, the service is above and beyond. And there prices are well below this level of food quality."}
{"text":"It's okay the place is clean the people are very nice they attended us really fast she came over and checked on us constantly."}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday and only one couple was in there. This was a good indication they are not popular. I ordered lunch for $7.95 which is an okay price. It consisted of mostly noodles (Pad Thai beef) with very little meat. It was very sweet and so was the soup. The noodles were very starchy and appeared to be over cooked. I live close to this restaurant, but I don't think I'll be returning. There are so many more great Thai restaurants in town where I can get a really good lunch for $7.95."}
{"text":"Worst place in LV.   Came here after a quick visit to the outlets. Looking for something to eat near by, my best friend and decided to come here after seeing the reviews.   First off, it's located in a shady strip mall that looks abandon. Outside and inside interior needs a big makeover. Walked in, got seated and was legged waiting for over 15 minutes without anyone coming to check on us. Not even water. It wasn't even busy either.   We were so hungry and after no one approaching us after a long wait we walked out... they didn't even see us leave since they were busy doing other things.   I'm never in this part of the city to begin with. Never again."}
{"text":"We came in the other night 30 minutes before closing.  As we were walking in the only other table seated was leaving.  Instead of begrudging us for coming in so late, we were given a very warm welcome.   You could say the reason we got such great service was because we were the only patrons but I don't believe that to be true.   You could tell the servers were kind and caring.   They answered all questions with patience, they never once made us feel rushed and they made sure our drinks were full.   On top of that I would say that this is one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in a while when judging price to taste.   The food was fresh (I always judge the shrimp! ) and very flavorful.   And the value was spot on.   We spent less than $40 on 4 very filling dishes.   We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I am not even done eating my meal and I wanted to stop to review.  I am from out of town and in Vegas for business and was so happy to find this place.  Egg rolls were wonderful,  crisp and full of vegetables.  The  massamam curry is fragrant and full of flavor.  The hostess recommended level 3 and it was spicy but not overly hot.  What a wonder place.  I look forward to further visits."}
{"text":"I don't know who is writing these reviews. I am a Thai food connaseaur.l eat at manyThai restaurants. I decided to try this place today. The previous owner's food was awful.  I got Pad Kee Mao. My favorite dish I always get no matter where I go. Not only was it dry, it had absolutely no flavor, the only thing I could taste was the hot peppers. I came to work and mentioned to my co-worker how bad it was.  She said she ate there too and it was bland also.  How can you ruin Thai food? I don't understand it. I can make it better. The price was high too. My dish was almost $13.00. The same dish at another Thai place l love is $6.95 lunch, $8.95 dinner. My co-workers was $15.00 for herself. I hope they improve because they are very nice, the restaurant is clean and well decorated. More flavor and sauce is what they need and lower the prices."}
{"text":"Great Thai place  The Pad Thai was great and the house made coconut ice cream is to die for"}
{"text":"Great food - the wait during lunch is always a little long, so if you are limited on time I suggest ordering ahead. :)   Nice clean setting and the staff is at least aware of what a vegan/vegetarian diet is so they will actually tell you if you order something that has a meat base or broth, dairy, etc. Always appreciate that!"}
{"text":"Amazing interior decor and ambient lighting. Service and food is fast! Curry is extremely delicious here. I can taste the individual ingredients in the curry that come together like a nice medley."}
{"text":"We found \"I am Thai\" a few nights ago as our family drove around starving and browsing Yelp - and I must say, this is probably my new favorite Thai spot in the valley! And, seing as I worked in a Thai restaurant where everything was prepared authentically by a 70 year old Thai woman - it's pretty hard to impress me.   The service was the first thing that stood out. All the waitresses were very attentive, had a great sense of humor, and never left a dirty dish nor empty glass on the table the entire time we dined.   The food was amazing. We had the beef jerky and papaya salad for starters. Then we had entrees. I had shrimp red curry, my husband had Thai style BBQ, and my daughters had shrimp tempura, vegetarian red curry, and shrimp fried rice. We hadn't eaten all day, so this was the perfect amount of food for all of us with a little bit of leftovers. I was greatly imprssed overall, but I have to say that the red curry typically makes or breaks my love for a Thai restaurant, and it was nothing short of perfection here. Yay!   Another bonus, the check was written in Thai. When we asked why, we were told it was so all the cooks could understand the orders (as they didn't read English). It's no wonder everything was amazing, it was authentically prepared. We look forward to coming back again very soon!!"}
{"text":"Authentic and Delicious!  Looking for good Thai restaurant? Search no more... this is a place to check out! Located at the intersection of Warm Springs and Placid. A short drive from the South Premium Outlet Mall (shopping makes me hungry!).   Been here thrice with my family and we always get the crab fried rice - they are generous with the crab meat! My wife loves it!   Other faves: Thai Dumplings, Combo Appetizer, and Beef Jerky.   Everything was delicious! Service is enthusiastic and friendly. Can't wait to bring our friends here."}
