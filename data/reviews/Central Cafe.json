{"text":"Found this hidden little gem in the large building at 2600 N. Central.  Friend and I stopped there to eat.  You get to the restaurant through the lobby and take the elevator.  A pleasant and pristine atmosphere.  Really just so clean.  Had the Hawaiian sandwich special, comes with a side for very reasonable price!  Quick and good and great menu.  I hope to return and try their breakfast menu.  Everyone very pleasant there.  Try it.  It's very nice.

{"text":"This cafe has much more than you would think. Artisan sandwiches. Yummy fries. Friendly owner. The place is immaculately clean and decorated so tastefully. I had the pesto chicken and fries. Very hearty. Great prices, too."}
{"text":"people that work there are super rude.  I will go to the cafe at the building next door next time for sure.   Food is overpriced."}
{"text":"Yesterday I forgot my lunch and I decided to go to the Central Cafe for lunch.  I'm so glad I did.  The special was Shredded Beef Tacos.  They were by far the best tacos I have had in a really long time. :)  Thanks Central Cafe for the best tacos."}
{"text":"Negative 1 for me, I ordered a turkey BLT for $7.59 and they put 2 pieces of turkey bacon on this huge sandwich. meanwhile you get a handful 5 or more slices of pork bacon on the same sandwich for the same price. When I confronted the manager about it she said that turkey bacon costs more than pork bacon...REALLY!!  if it costs more than pork charge more and make me a Sandwich for Christ's sake! I'm never going back!! Never! they should leave the B off and call it a LT sandwich!! SMH! I wish I could post a pic of how skimpy my sandwich is! I work in the building and it's a shame they suck so bad and are so rude!! Never Ever going back!!"}
{"text":"Don't do it.

I work in the building and though it seems convenient, it's not worth it with so many better choices nearby.

My first visit was for an egg salad sandwich and a side of cottage cheese. Though I'm unsure which did it. I was sick to my stomach for 2 days.

My second visit I decided to try a hot item and ordered a breakfast burrito. It was terrible. Nearly tasteless and with a similar gastric result. 

No thanks. Not again."}
