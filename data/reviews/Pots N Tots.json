{"text":"Delcioua tots and the food is amazing but the portion size is very small and the price is definitely not worth it. It was $6 + tax for literally 8-12 tater tots total. While the tots were delicious it's definitely not worth $.50 per tot."}
{"text":"The hot beef sandwich is very, very good. What keeps me coming back are the Parmesan garlic tots though. The owner is always very friendly, which can't be said for all food cart vendors. Unfortunately, he's not been on the Capitol Square for a while (moved elsewhere in the city, according to his website), so no more amazing tots for me."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  The tots are very crisp and have delicious flavoring.  The owner takes great pride in his product and uses the freshest ingredients.  Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Used to eat here before class. I've tried ranch, taco, and another flavor and they were all good. Pricey but it's a food cart, what do you expect. Located outside the educational sciences building. A very yummy, flavorful meal. It looks like he uses a huge bag of frozen tots and just tosses them with seasonings."}
{"text":"Service was great tots were totty... Nothing special. The hot beef sandwich was a bit dry but not bad. Seems like every time I see this food cart it seems to being robust business."}
{"text":"For you freaks who consider tater tots a food group - like myself - pots n tots is food truck nirvana. Try everything, you don't even need to make a choice."}
{"text":"This place is great, the tots are all really good, I have tried the volcanic explosion, ranch, taco, and loaded baked potato.  Ranch and loaded baked potato are the best, and he even makes his own bacon salt for the load baked potato, it is one of several distinct flavors.  Another good option is to get both ranch and volcanic explosion, and instead of dipping the hot ones in ranch dressing (which they have), you follow it up with a ranch tot, really good.  Be warned though that the hot ones are quite spicy.  Sandwiches are also really tasty, good comfort food, and quite filling, though I wish they were a little bigger.  Even so, the combo with a sandwich and tots for $7 or so is a good deal and a filling meal."}
{"text":"Back again and I couldn't be happier. Today's special was POUTINE! *swoons* How could I resist? You still get to choose the flavor for the tots, so I went with the owner's recommendation of ranch. YUM! Crispy seasoned tots, covered in shredded cheddar and some of the beef and gravy from their pot roast. While not 'traditional' this is a delicious version of a personal favorite. Add a BBQ chicken sandwich (consistently tender and delicious) and a can of Coca-Cola and I'm thinking $10 for practically instant lunch is a sweet deal.

Again I'm struck by the fantastically positive demeanor of the owner. He clearly listens to his customers and so far I find his suggestions to be spot on. One of my coworkers said, on our way back to the office, \"This is the highlight of my Wednesdays!\" They brought lunch but planned for a side of tots, btw. Any office dweller will understand the value of something special to look forward to mid-week."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with Pots N Tots. I'm a huge lover of tater tots so I was very excited to try them out. For the price, the portion sizes were very small. I understand that foodcarts often work on small margins, but when you pay $3.25 for an order I'd expect more than a dozen tater tots. The wait was also exceptionally long for something I'd imagine to be a quick fry and then toss in the seasoning. The seasoning is the only redeeming quality, but is not so amazing that it justifies the premium."}
