{"text":"I somehow only made it to Coronado Cafe once before they closed, and it was a great experience.  So I was naturally excited to see the transformation into Urban Vine.  Unfortunately, I wish it hadn't changed.  I see and admire what the place is going for, but it seems they've tried too hard.  Simple lunch foods were fancied up too much.  The burger was just okay, and the chicken sandwich didn't taste like any other chicken sandwich I've had before.  Boo.  Both came with chips that were so heavy on the salt and vinegar that we couldn't eat them.  A fresh selection of things to add to your water was fun.  Lastly, the table was as crowded as the menu, and simply wasn't comfortable.  Here's the thing - a simple old house with a simple old menu would have the chance to be very successful here.  If that happens, I'll be excited to return."}
{"text":"Excellent food but they were not prepared for restaurant week - terrible service - I think they were short staffed :("}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The atmosphere is nice, the staff is friendly and attentive. I had a foie gras and mushroom appetizer ( sooo good), and the Kobe burger, which was one of the best I've had. My wife had the crab cakes. I don't even like seafood, but I liked these crab cakes. The only negative: they don't have desert. Or at least none they are proud of. When I asked the waitress what their deserts were, she said \"we don't really have any. We have a cookie. There is a pie place right down the way.\" Overall great place."}
{"text":"I have read about Urbane Vine for some time and we were excited to finally try out this much acclaimed spot.  The evening started on a high note with well crafted drinks prepared by the server.  Our dinner guest is very particular about her Cosmos and usually sends them back several times for revisions - not so this time.  The Cosmo was spot on.    However, after our drinks,  not much else went as one would expect from a well known chef and highly acclaimed restaurant.  The service, as noted in many other reviews, was cool and indifferent.    Our salads had lots of greens, but very little of the rest of the items listed in the description.  We ordered bread to accompany the salad. (an extra charge ) All but one piece was burnt.  Could someone not see this and redo the order?  A well known valley restaurant critic suggested that you order Urban Vine's \"nightly seafood-in-a-bag, that it was filled with bamboo shoots, mushrooms and baby corn in an impossible fragrant lemon-saffron broth\"  I couldn't wait to try this culinary adventure.  My husband and I both ordered this seafood steamed special.  Bad advice.    First, our \"bags\" were delivered to the table while we were still eating our salads.  This is inexcusable for a restaurant..  Who's in charge of pacing dinners?  Urbane Vine was not busy that evening.  Once again, a disconnect in quality service.    Secondly, our dinner guest had a slightly different description of our steamed bags when she asked \"what is that brown stuff in the bottom of the bag\"!  Rather than a \"fragrant broth\" we had collection  of mushy, overcooked, salty vegetable with two shrimp and a small piece of what we think was overcooked salmon.  My husband and I dine out 4 to 6 times a month.  We understand that things can and will go wrong sometimes.   However, when service, timing and quality of food are lacking it's hard to book a return visit."}
{"text":"Decided to try it last night with a friend.  Ordered the scallops with quinoa.  The scallops were cooked nicely the rest of the food was salty and unappealing.  The water tastes like chlorine.  The bill for two people and two beers was $70.  Pretty steep for a \"casual\" bar.  Too many other restaurants in the valley where you can get a nice meal for less than $35 a person.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"I had dinner with five other friends at Urban Vine last night. The food was good but the service was really slow. It took almost 40 minutes to get our appetisers which were just cold cut and global cheese and sourdough bread. The server felt bad and comp us a few drinks and desserts. Overall, the food was good but the kitchen needs to pick up the speed."}
{"text":"ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT! We decided to try the new place lured in by HH thru sunset. So let's  start there. The happy hour sucks. No food only wine and beer reduced to $5 which in the case of beer it is basically no discount.  Regardless we decided to stay for dinner. The meat plate is ridiculously small and overpriced. But it comes with 2 small slices of burnt bread. The burger was great, the pork belly was an example of taking liberties with a dish which should just be served traditionally (as opposed to the spicy shredded meat that came to the table). Service definitely hit or miss.  I appreciated the true commitment to getting it right, but it should not come at the expense of being flustered and apologetic.  I think we will let things \"mature\" a bit before we give it another shot."}
{"text":"Our party of four arrived early, but were seated right away. Server was very sweet. We all decided to do the Restaurant Week menu, and everyone really loved their meals. I asked for a wine pairing, and the wines were right on the money for the courses. Had the gazpacho to start; it was so flavorful with just the right amount of heat--shrimp were sweet and tender. This was paired with a Chenin Blanc. Perfect! Then I opted for the Paella, and was soooo happy I did. Probably the best paella I've ever eaten. Flavors were fabulous, with great chorizo and tender, fresh fish--again, great shrimp. I ate every grain of rice--would probably have licked the bowl if I hadn't been out to eat. The Malbec was excellent with this course. Dessert was a moist, chewy brownie on a cloud of whipped cream--a chocoholic's dream. Had a cup of coffee with dessert, and it was full-flavored and nutty. Scrumptious meal from start to finish. Service was great and loved the eclectic ambiance. I only have one complaint--we live out by the San Tan Mountains, so it is a 70-mile roundtrip. But well worth it--we will be back."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place so much!! Went for lunch during a business trip to Phoenix. The minute I drove into the parking lot I knew it was going to be someplace special. Entering the front door through the quaint old porch I began to look around at the beautiful decor. I loved the renovations such as the repurposed tin on the ceiling, The beautiful bar, The artwork and pretty much everything in the place! I was fortunate to have the opportunity to speak with the owner. He was very nice, gave me a lot of information about their renovation and was very pleasant to talk to. That however was only the beginning of my experience in this one-of-a-kind restaurant. The food was beyond my ability to describe how wonderful it was. I had the crabcakes and the other two people I was with had the meatloaf. We began with an appetizer of the bruschetta and I could not find anything negative to say about anything we ate. The crabcakes just melted in my mouth and the addition of kale was an excellent complement. The meatloaf was probably the best I have ever tasted. It was very moist and very flavorful. The chef is amazing and I don't think you would be disappointed ordering anything on the menu unless you would give McDonald's five stars. I own a house in Mesa and I can't wait to go back again to try other things on the menu and also some of the great cocktails. this meal was by far the best part of my three-day trip. Thank you urban vine or my nickname for you urban find"}
{"text":"I'm late to add this review but my husband and I had dinner here last week and were very impressed. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable and the food was great! We ordered most of menu and were impressed with almost all of it. My favorite was the chicken with the mushroom risotto which I believe was a special. I could eat this dish everyday! YUM! We live in the Coronado neighborhood and plan to frequent this new establishment :)"}
{"text":"I just wanted to give an update since there's been a change of menu since my last visit.  It's streamlined, but there's still a nightly bag and what is on the menu is still really good.  The service was, as usual, terrific."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for our weekly date night.  We sat outside on the patio and received quick service.  Very friendly staff.  The food was amazing.  We had one of the specials, which was venison and bone marrow, with romanesco.  We also ordered the open face meatloaf sandwich.  Both were great, creative dishes.  It is great seeing a chef who takes so much pride in the food he prepares, even when it is meatloaf (which was no ordinary meatloaf).  Every dish that cam out of the kitchen looked unique and we will be back to try more.   I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I noticed a different name at the old Coronado Cafe while driving by, so I decided to try the new establish for lunch.  I had the salad with beets and goat cheese.  I don't remember seeing it on the menu description, but I am pretty sure there was eggplant in there, too.  The curried eggplant is a nice seasonal touch.  Personally I would have preferred the beets plain, not curried.  I think the natural sweetness of the beets would have complemented the other ingredients, but instead the seasoning detracted from it.  Really like the decor with wine bottles, but where I was sitting my elbow kept hitting bottles.  I am an average-sized American, so it would be difficult for big men to feel comfortable here, I imagine.  Then again, it is a renovated bungalow, so if you want quaint and intimate, this is the place.  Like the option of rosemary for the water, too.  Overall a good experience.  They may be trying too hard in some areas or still working out little details, not sure.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot in central Phoenix! Great wine and beer offerings and some cool cocktails. I split the Shaken Wedge and Mole scented pork belly with my friend and it was very flavorful!  A great value for the food you revive vs the cost!!"}
{"text":"Phoenix Magazine ranked this as one of the five best new restaurants here this year.  Not much else to add -- but here goes!  Warmth, charm, gentility, and just enough quirk to make anybody feel very branche!  And Michael O'Dowd's kitchen?  Stunning in every way.  I had superlative, fresh off the tree Yuma dates slathered with goat cheese and all sorts of other brilliant, subtle additions as a starter.  My main was his transcendent pork belly, my other companions had a heavenly crab cake (WHERE did he source crab so fresh here??), and my third friend had a stupendous, sweet ribeye with the BEST mushroom risotto I have ever tasted.  Did a cheese assortment for dessert instead of something sweet, and WOW WOW WOW.  I will be living in this delectable little charmer.  Go immediately!"}
{"text":"OMG! I had the special of scallops with orzo.  It was so delicious!  The service was superb, a friend ordered a steak-rare.  She pointed out to the waiter that it was a little over done, but she was ok with it.  The waiter came back and said the chef insisted that he would make her another dinner.  My friend said it wasn't necessary, waiter told her that the chef insisted.  I was impressed.  The old house had its classic quaint atmosphere, small rooms with small tables.  It was a very nice atmosphere.  It was a bit more expensive than I planned to pay, but it was well worth it. I would go again in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"I rarely do yelp reviews, but I couldn't pass up saying something about this gem.  I live in the neighborhood and had dinner with friends here last night.  Absolutely loved the comfortable, homey atmosphere, and the service was personal and great.  Most importantly, my burger was cooked TO PERFECTION, which can be nearly impossible to find.  The happy hour $2 tacos were excellent, as were the $3 happy hour drafts.  These guys have tons of ideas about making this little bungalow restaurant even better, and I'm excited to see it develop, but we loved it already and plan to come back over and over."}
{"text":"The house is so charming and intimate with small rooms. We started with the tacos. They were so good we are going back and get plates  of them . There are few and far between that I consider so good I would drive anywhere in Phoenix. Crab cakes are everything we read about. Just enough to hold them together all you tasted was crab. The pork dish was very good too, but I was thinking about those tacos. We also ordered the salad with the beets, bacon and goat cheese tossed with greens. The dressing was very good but I would leave the beets off the plates. They were in a curry and they were too busy  with the salad. Lastly came the chocolate cake. It was very tasty but it was very cold and should have been taken out and let it get to room temp. before serving. Also I was happy to see they serve two types of iced tea. One was plain black which every restaurant should have . No one gets it that those teas made with fruit alters your tastebuds and fights the foods flavors. All in all we are going back and very soon!"}
{"text":"Great cheese selection and prices are very reasonable. We will for sure come back for more bites."}
{"text":"This review is based on 3 visits. I want to like this place, because I can walk there, but the service is atrocious - especially on the weekend.   Most recently, I went on a Friday with 4 friends. We did not have a reservation. The server should have told us that they were booked or we needed a reservation. Instead she invited us to sit at the bar and said when a table opened up, she'd seat us. We waited 45 minutes. We were initially fine to wait to be seated, but then could not manage to get a second drink at the bar. There were 4-10 people standing at the bar and no bartender offering drinks - the waitstaff just kept running back to make drinks for their tables.   Since there was no assigned bartender, we decided another drink wasnt happened so we asked again about a table (thinking we would do better to go somewhere else) she said \"they just got the bill and are leaving\". Another 30 minutes for her to run the credit card and clear the table. It would be better to be honest about wait times or just tell walk-ins that you cannot accommodate them.   We then sat down and ordered immediately. We waited 1 hour from order time to arrival of appetizers - 1 hour for 4 bruchettas and 1 gazpacho, meanwhile the next table had three courses. Not sure if the problem was timing in the kitchen or servers placing orders incorrectly, but our server never came by to apologize, tell us what the problem was, or offer some bread or something to nibble on. I eventually got up and went inside to ask for bread and water, the server reported, \"oh yeah, your order is on its way\". We waited 10 more minutes.   It took a third hour for them to serve our main course and dessert (they ran out of the ordered items and replaced with a dry, plain brownie). There were no napkins or silverware at our table - we had to go scavenge from other tables.  It then took 20 minutes to request our bill and get out of there. We did ask for a comp or discount given we had been there 3.5 hours. The thing is, the place was busy when we arrived (so I understand the wait), but once we were seated there were probably only 7 tables eating and the place was nearly empty when we received our main course.    There was no assigned bartender, host, table clearer - three servers running around doing everything. Maybe the kitchen was short staffed or a bartender called in sick, but it's important for servers to be honest about wait times and also to apologize for the delays.  We would have given more of a tip and a better review, if there had been some acknowledgment of the poor service. An apology, an offer of a snack, or just telling us they were slammed and would take awhile. Instead we had a server who never came to the table to make the experience better.  The food was good (esp the filet mignon), but nothing makes up for such terrible service. On the bright side, the drinks have consistently been good when I have been there. The wine pours are very generous.  If you go to Urban Vine, go on a weekday with lots of time."}
{"text":"Good idea.  Ok execution.  Menu is confusing (meat board per person-just want to share w/ fiancé).  Scallops and other seafood smelled like rotten fish.  The restaurant crowd looked overwhelmed by \"what's the smell\" face.  Usually means not fresh.  Please print out the daily specials instead of having the server name off 10 dishes (server and guests are equally frustrated).  There's only 4 or 5 dishes offered on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I liked the eclectic atmosphere! Grilled Chicken Sandwich (Best I've had in a long time!!) with sides, cucumber salad (Good) and berry salad (Great)"}
{"text":"First visit, but we were pretty impressed.  We were instantly greeted at the door, and allowed to pick our place to sit.  The service was top notch, the atmosphere is simple and charming.  The beer and wine list is short but not disappointing.  As for the food, the 24 hour pork belly is my new instant favorite;  it's a little spicy, but in a very good way. I only wish I would have had another piece of bread to finish mopping up my plate.  The crab cakes are good too, but I think there more exciting things on the menu to try.  We we watched in anticipation what the tables around us ordered and have already anticipated our next visit.  Nice work MOD!  We're glad you chose this spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great vibe and food. Cozy. All local produce. Ordered the ceaser salad, tomatoe bisque, and olives. Delicious ona colder Phoenix evening. Friend ordered the kobe burger. Mouth watering! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  It was a little small but charming and we didn't need reservations. The menu looked awesome!  Unfortunately the owner Michael O'Dowd (who has posted pictures of himself in a magazine, so we know it was him) was sitting behind us at the bar and talking VERY loudly and VERY inappropriately.  We heard comments and unsavory gossip about nearly everyone in town, \"so and so's fake tits\" and how everyone is stupid for thinking he has a new concept, \"he's just doing exactly what he did at Kai\".  Well, after nearly 30 minutes of this type of talk during our meal; which was decent but bland, we declined dessert just to get away! I had the tomato bisque and pork belly.  I would have been back to try some addtional dishes to see if I just had a bad pick but after that obnoxious scene from the owner himself, I 'm not interested in supporting that type of restaurant."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are very pleased with this place!  Trendy atmosphere, awesome art, and amazing food!  I had the mesquite grilled chicken sandwich (wow) and she had the pulled pork sandwich.  We swapped halves.  Both were fantastic.  Eat here if you can.  We're coming back!"}
{"text":"We loved Renegade by MOD and visited many times, so we were eager to check this place out. Funnily enough, my wife had booked the rez and I didn't realize this was the new MOD restaurant, but I knew the moment I had a bite of the delicious Yuma Date Meatloaf. The very creative blend of ingredients recalled some of the creative flair from Renegade, with the local ingredients and little touches that exemplify attention to detail. All-around, our apps, entress and drinks were all great.  I would say that the service could be a little better, but I chalk it up to new-ness. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly, but we had a super-long wait for our appetizers to come out, and then our entrees were out before our apps were done and our check not long afterward. We might have had a second drink had we been asked. Hopefully the kitchen and wait staff will gel in time.  If you're a foodie or just want to have a good time (as with Renegade, I think this would be a great first-date spot... if conversation gets slow you can always talk about the food), you really need to try Urban Vine."}
{"text":"Great little spot that has a lot of potential as long as they don't get too pretentious with being the new kid on the block. There's some room for improvement but overall it was great and we'll be back to see what else they'll do.   Really good wine, we live in the neighborhood so I'll hoof it for a good red on the patio. The patio was really nicely decorated with the string lights and a shade sail. It was really intimate. We ordered the pork tacos, they were really good. It had a peach salsa type on top and it went well with the cinnamon spiced pork. At least I think that was in the rub....the portions were good size, three tacos and a side salad for $16. Loved the water and the glasses they were served in, nice touch with the option of lemon, lime or rosemary. I really liked the front porch experience, it was quaint and stayed true to the bungalow vibe. That's why we love the Coronado district. I don't drink beer but the waitress said they had a good selection. The staff was great, very friendly, food was fast and they kept the wine flowing. Dessert really good too. Overall the bill was $80 for two for an app, two entrees, two desserts, HH wine for two and two regular priced wine. A little steep, but we did order a lot.   If they could improve on a few things, I'd definitely make this a regular spot and they're new so it's easy to forgive as they are testing the waters.   The side salad, who eats iceberg nowadays? Just switch it out for field greens and it's instantly better. The mustard vinaigrette was really good with big grains of mustard. Perfectly dressed with tomatoes and cucumbers. Simple but good.   I thought an established and experienced chef could do better than ikea glasses and bowls but that was minor and didn't take away from the food.   I was expecting more out of the menu, run of the mill Caesar salad and chicken sandwich, boring and every restaurant in a 10 block radius has it on their menu.   The specials sounded amazing, throw out your set menu and replace them with your specials with descriptions and pricing, detailing the organic and local ingredients you use. I had to ask the waitress to repeat the specials twice because they were complex. And they sounded delicious and I didn't want to overlook one.   Or make a seasonal menu and rotate it. I think there were 6 menu items all together on the Chef's specials menu (which I think is a lot?) and they all sounded 10x better than the regular items. If you're going to go to the trouble of making an elaborate and expansive menu like that, advertise it better. Make it easier for the customer to order and I bet you'll sell more \"specials\". Showcase them, because they're the show stopper.   However I will say there was a chicken salad on the \"regular\" menu other than the Caesar, that I definitely want to try!   Overall we will be back. If you go, drink the wine, get the creme brûlée and make sure you hear the specials, they are good!"}
{"text":"Love this old house New owners Making a gallant effort to serve Good food and service Shawn wedge very good  Crab cakes delicious  Pulled pork good but heavy for hubby We wi"}
{"text":"Wow. I just read the reviews and I was shocked how the owner responded to dissatisfied customer Cari S. Atmosphere, including furnishings and decor are absolutely part of the overall dining experience. His response was rude and lacked professionalism.  My meal was ok. Needless to say, I miss Coronado cafe. I would have tried again though if not for what I read."}
{"text":"We came here for Restaurant Week and aside from a few hiccups, it was an excellent meal.  Service was excellent and we had a cute window-side table in the bar area.    I generally don't like fruit in savory food but the bruschetta with cherries and goat cheese was pretty darn tasty.  My filet was also fantastically seasoned and delicious and the seasoned potatoes were very yummy.    Just a few suggestions:  We really enjoyed the drinks but the double digit prices + lots of ice make it feel like not a very good deal.    I wasn't asked how I wanted my filet cooked so it was more done than I would have liked.   I had the nutella pudding for dessert and it was something of a fail.  The pudding itself had little white bits in it and the texture was unappealing.  I also realized they served it in an ashtray.  (Granted, it's a vintage ashtray and I know this because I grew up with a smoker.)  It's one of those things where I appreciate the inventive use of it but it's original intention as an ashtray was a bit off-putting."}
{"text":"FYI, still showing as open on google. Drove all the way out there from Chandler. Also, would update the \"CLOSED\" on your website. Hard to see if using a mobile device.  A side note it's frustrating to have somewhere that sells good food play the \"closed in summer game\". Customers are built one by one. We will be back when the restaurant opens (if it does - the decision to close was clearly not pre-planned) but places that are actually good in Phoenix have enough business to at least pay the bills in Summer."}
{"text":"Came here during a work trip to Phoenix and really liked it. It's set in a beautifully decorated house. The food was outstanding and service was very attentive. I would recommend the meat loaf and Mac and cheese. The wine selection is decent as well. Cute place for either a date or a group dinner."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. The atmosphere was so beautiful and I loved the renovations that the owners made. So after being so impressed with this renovated 1920\"s bungalow we then got to the amazing food. The crab cakes were amazing!!! 2 people I was with had meatloaf which they loved and my one bite melted in my mouth. The owner was very nice and told me about the renovations. If you have a chance you must go to this great place"}
{"text":"Took family from back east in for dinner.  Went into bar area as we were early for reservation.  Bartender took order for two of our party of four, and went to make those drinks.  After serving, I said we also would like a drink.  Beer ordered was from keg that \"blew out.\"  Said that was on house and would bring another.  Later at table were told they were out.  Asked waiter  about specials.  He read off 5 or 6 main courses (filet, artic char, etc).  We asked what these dishes came with.  He said to let him know which dish we were interested in and he would then tell us what the entire meal included.  All four of us ordered filet.  Waiter came back 5-10 minutes later to tell us they were out of filet, at 7 pm on Friday night.  The restaurant was not full.    Restroom visit found no towels in dispenser.  Food was fine, service was sloppy, disinterested and not very professional.  Don't think our guests were very impressed with our restaurant choice.  Can't really think of a reason to go back.  Service and food quite a bit better at St. Francis and several other places in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love houses that are converted into restaurants. They always seem to have a more local and welcoming feel to them. I had been wanting to try Urban Vine since they had taken over the old Coronado Cafe which had a great ambiance. I came here with one of my girlfriends for dinner last Saturday. The ambiance is just as comforting as the old Coronado Cafe, but with a much more interesting menu. We started off with drinks, I had the Monte Vista which was a fruity vodka cocktail, a little on the sweet side for me, but still a great warm weather cocktail and my friend had the Pinot Noir. For dinner we shared a few things; the arugula salad, warm dates and crab cakes. The portion sizes were very large, we could have gotten away with two dishes easily (if you're a lighter eater). Everything was delicious, the salad was a fresh combo of thinly sliced cucumbers, beets, goat cheese, bacon and was perfectly dressed. The dates were a sweet and savory combo with a little bit of spice. The crab cakes were nicely done not too heavy on the breading and had a wonderful Meyer lemon sauce. Service was on point and friendly too. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"So, they took a cute house and turned it into a quiet place to enjoy dinner.  The menu seemed creative, I started off with some salmon ceviche, then off for Brochette-the bread was great and the dish had a nice twist.  Had Buffalo for main course- first time- very good.  The service was really good as well but a little more pricey than I expected.  I would Give them 3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"My family visited Urban Vine a few weeks ago and had a wonderful lunch.  The restaurant has been updated since previously housing the Coronado Cafe, and it looks wonderful.    The food was likewise delicious.  I ordered the taco special for that day, which featured 3 street tacos for $12.  I was disappointed by the serving size of this dish, and the tacos were all small and there were no sides.  I left lunch a little hungry after just eating the tacos.  At the same time, however, the tacos were extremely flavorful and very well-prepared.  My wife ordered the mesquite grilled chicken sandwich and loved her meal.  The sandwich was equally packed with flavor and, unlike the tacos, came with 2 sides to round out the meal.  When we visit again, I will be ordering this sandwich (and not the tacos)."}
{"text":"My wife had the 24-pork belly and I had the Kobe burger, both were excellent!!  Friendly staff and great atmosphere, we would highly recommend Urban Vine!  On the initial review I forgot to add our appetizer (so I'm adding it now), the beer cheese float...just like the rest of our food...outstanding!!!!"}
{"text":"DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO EAT THERE SO THIS REVIEW IS BASED OFF THE ENVIORMENT UNTIL I'M ABLE TO RETURN.  I suggest you make reservations if attending for dinner. Dropped in for dinner and it was packed. Every table was reserved for the night so hubby and I had to leave :( BUT I got a good look and it was super cute. I will definitely return WITH RESERVATIONS!"}
{"text":"The name definitely fits the atmosphere, service and interior design of the restaurant.  It had cozy, intimate dining rooms, yes multiple dining rooms with a unique setting per room.   The menu was very modern and contained international elements (kimchee, manchego, tzatziki etc.)  The food was amazing and we are definitely going to return to try different menu items, multiple times, many times   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience...twice!  The first time we stopped in several months ago they were closed even though their website, social media, Yelp listing etc. said they should be open.  We came back again this weekend and ordered drinks at the bar.  My wine was served in a cup instead of a wine glass...even though they had wine glasses hanging over my head - not sure why?  The bartender could have cared less that we were there and slammed my drink down on the bar.  The restaurant has a really cozy, shabby chic feel that I like, but the menu appears quite limited.  I didn't quite understand why there were so many daily specials written on a chalkboard instead of including some of them in the menu.  The daily specials just said scallops, halibut etc. with no description of how they are prepared and what they are served with...let alone no prices listed either."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and great food.   Enjoyed the daily special and the look and feel of the casual atmosphere.  Not far from downtown phoenix and parking was no issue.  A great addition to the downtown restaurant options for me"}
{"text":"I've been going here since it was \"Coronado Cafe\".  Coronado Cafe was top notch several years ago, but quality steadily declined. When it became \"Urban Vine\" it was a complete resurrection. Have not had anything sub par yet. Draft beer selection is good, wine list good, service is always great. This has been our latest go to place and have not been disappointed.  Brunch is great, but they close at 3:00, so a boozy afternoon is out of the question (there).  My only criticism would be the serving of condiments in ashtrays, which I have been assured are brand new and never held cigarette butts, but still creep me out. Last time I was there, I asked if there was a scrap from the kitchen for our two dogs, we got three nice pieces of bacon! Yay! Thanks. Call me a regular customer of the Urban Vine."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. I came here to meet a friend for lunch and I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is charming and calm. The outdoor patio is roomy and the tables are large enough for 4 people to have a lovely meal al fresco.  I had the chicken sandwich and I feel it was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love it, but just couldn't get there. The Kobe burger was pretty good, but the sloppy joe was just awful and the black bean hummus (that was $10) was very meh. Just want to add, that the sloppy joe is not even in the same universe of what you would expect. It looked/tasted nothing like a sloppy joe, and was about as bland as could be. The service was great, and we had a great time, but will only be back for drinks and will make sure to eat beforehand."}
{"text":"The menu looked pretty good, and I was exciting to head here for dinner, but the place was super loud. I couldn't hear my date across the table. Food was so so, I do remember gazpacho being especially delicious, and the drinks being okay but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"This review is based on Restaurant Week Dinner.  The menu differed slightly than what was posted on-line and the Pate first course and the second course peppercorn crusted filet were dropped. I'm not sure if they did offer the $12 wine paring as I forgot to ask about it and my server didn't mention it. Service seemed much more casual than from my last visit. The water is no longer garnished with fruit or rosemary embellishments and the restaurant specials weren't on a menu and were told to us verbally.  In a nut shell the the first courses and dinners were all delicious.  I got a large serving of crusty local Noble Bread Bruschetta topped with yummy fresh local dates and creamy goat cheese and cranberries. It was messy to eat but it was delicious.  My husband had the gazpacho. It didn't have lobster nuggets as stated on the restaurant week menu but it did have nicely prepared whole shrimp.  For dinner I had the Basil Salmon that came with ribbons of squash and creamy cheesy smoked grits. The salmon was really delicious and prepared PERFECT. It had a nice sear and was cooked medium rare. I liked the flavors very much, it was seasoned just right. Squash was tasty and was on the spicy side. The grits were very creamy cheesy and smokey.   My husband had the Bacon wrapped meatloaf that was over pulled pork that came with mashed potatoes and green beans. He said it was all delicious and this was a great choice for restaurant week.  I wasn't big on the desserts. I do note I am very picky about dessert and maybe it's just me. I tend not to care for most desserts I try out in restaurants anyway.  I was still happy I picked this restaurant for restaurant week the dinners were delicious!"}
{"text":"We went last night and it was great!  The bartender/server was very knowledgable about the menu.  My wife got the sloppy joe lean and she loved it.  She's not a vegetarian but said it was as good if not better than she's had with meat.    I got the crab cakes and they were moist and delicious.  The sautéed kale was a nice addition.  Good food, great service and a cool atmosphere is why we will be back.  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"A group of us thought we would try this place out for restaurant week. Very cute and charming restaurant and we were able to sit on the patio. Service was friendly but we scarcely saw our waiter- I think he may have been the only one for the full restaurant on a Saturday night. The restaurant week menu online was slightly different from what was presented to us in the restaurant- they only had two of the appetizers and the petite filet was also not offered. I had the gazpacho for my appetizer which was good. There were two shrimp added on top which was also a nice touch.  For entree I had the salmon and cheesy grits- both were very tasty. The salmon was cooked very nicely and the grits were very tasty.  Other members of our group ordered the pork entree and the paella. Both pork entrees had to be sent back to the kitchen- they came out cold in temperature. The paella lacked in flavor and substance. The menu advertised on the restaurant week looked really delicious. Unfortunately, the actual menu and meal did not quite live up to the advertisement and our expectations."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I stopped in here on a Thursday evening after noticing the new sign (this place used to be Coronado Cafe). Anyone familiar with the Phoenix of late knows how charming these converted bungalows are, and Urban Vine is no exception. Walking up to the door is extra pleasant due to the pomegranate trees and fresh herbs planted along the path and on the front porch. We noticed fresh rosemary at the table, so I can only assume they use these fresh herbs in the kitchen as well. I love that. There's been a lot of remodeling since Coronado, but they did a great job and the inside looks really nice. They've gotten creative with the use of wine crates on the walls, local steampunk art (which is for sale), and Edison bulbs a-plenty. All that being said, the patio is AWESOME. I'm excited to come back and hang out on the patio, but this time we sat inside at the bar area. It was appropriately dim, and the only atmospheric complaint is that it was kind of hot so maybe a fan would help circulate air a bit.  The wines and cocktail we tried were good. The wine list is short and well thought out, which I really appreciate because it lowers the risk of getting wine from a bottle that's been open too long. They also serve bottled beer at $4, and I spied a couple of draft While I can't vouch for the food, the menu did look great and much simpler than Coronado's (which was too lengthy in my opinion). We will definitely be back for food...soon. At the end of the night we got to chatting with the owner who seemed cool and down to earth. You can tell when a newly opened restaurant has the right intentions, and this one does.   Bravo."}
{"text":"Great dinner on a Tuesday night at Urban Vine.  Half price wine night!  Had the paella in the \"bag\" and it was over the top.  My girlfriend liked it better that her entree and we ended up splitting it.  The restaurant is in a 1910 vintage house which is fairly charming.  I can see how the place would feel crowded if it were busy.  The waitstaff were cool and we had a super good time."}
{"text":"This place is culinary genius! Throw a dart at this menu and prepare to be amazed.  If you're not particularly good at throwing darts, you absolutely cannot go wrong with ordering the meatloaf. It's the best I've ever had and it's now an addiction. The meatloaf comes with a side of P Mac and the meal itself can be split between 2 people just fine.   Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD. We shared two of the specials and dessert and it was to die for. I don't know why they don't have more reviews; everything is farm to table, fresh, local, and NOM!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate a Saturday lunch here and left with lots of warm fuzzy feelings.   He had the meatloaf sandwich that is spicy and full of flavor.  If you don't like spicy, don't order it.  We on the other hand will order it over and over again.  I had the sloppy joe lean which as was delicious.   The daily sides were not listed on menu but certainly complemented the food.  We had watermelon and Fritos.   The watermelon cut the spice of both main courses.   This place is a great addition to the Valley dining scene."}
{"text":"Love the location of this cozy locally sourced restaurant with its old hard wood floors, intimate dining room, and small wooden bar that seats about six. (The bar top does not come out very far, so sitting comfortably against the bar is a bit challenging).  This is the kind of spot you take some one to get close and personal. It's also a great destination for craft cocktails,  and enjoying a food tour of what's in season.  On the menu you will find local loves such as Noble Sourdough bread, Schreiner meats, Queen Creek olives, Young Farms greens andYuma dates. Menu is comprised of standard American fare such as Salmon, Kobe Burger,  Crab cakes,  steak, and chicken.  The Kobe burger, when cooked medium rare, was juicy and had that nice charbroiled flavor. Otherwise there was nothing remarkable.  The Young Farms greens rocket and arugula salad was wonderful - with a unique curry and garam masala roasted beet, Crow's Dairy goat cheese, 7th Street bacon nuggets and finished with a cider nectar. The combination of flavors and textures was wonderful.  Our cocktails were the highlight of the evening.   Oliveira - tequila, sauvignon blanc, jalapeno infused elderflower,  lemon juice Monte vista - citrus vodka, rosemary syrup, IPA, lime juice, topped with sprig of mint Basquiat - bourbon, blackberry infused elderflower, lemon juice,  agave nectar  Each of these had such amazingly unique flavor profiles, and the Monte Vista was definitely the hit.  I think we probably did not sample dishes that really represented the brand and philosophy of the chef, but I think I would return only to sip their amazing cocktails on the patio, and maybe nosh on Noble Bread and global cheeses while I am it."}
{"text":"This is such a cozy and quaint place! The food is excellent. I had the mussels, and, as a mussels snob, I must say the white wine broth was fantastic. So was the grilled bread that came with it--however, half a slice was not quite enough and I had to order more. A nice touch: the choices to flavor the water (rosemary, orange, lemon, and lime). When the wine we ordered came in water glasses, though, our party of four rebelled: not trendy, but simply inelegant. We asked for wine glasses, which were promptly delivered. The reason I deducted one star is the time it took to prepare our bread pudding dessert: when it had not arrived at our table 25 minutes after ordering, we had to ask to have it boxed since we needed to catch a show. At a weeknight and only two dessert choices, it should not take that long to prepare. Overall, we loved the service and ambiance, and we will be back."}
{"text":"came in for Friday lunch. very cute and homey feeling place! had the crab cakes and very much enjoyed them. unlike some places these were more meat than bread and very tasty. would order them again. can see this being a great late afternoon happy hour place will come back"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Sunday and WOW what a terrific place! I'm so happy this neighborhood gem is not even a block away from my house! I had the great pleasure in meeting one of the owners when I was there and he could not be more amazing and accommodating.  The food was exceptional. I had the Crab cakes and they have been haunting my mind ever since, so delicious!  I also ordered this mouthwatering delectable hot cheese dip served with a shot of Pumpkin Porter and perfectly toasted garlic Noble Bread! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I both ordered the \"shaken cobb.\" Unfortunately, it was a bit silly. The salad came out in a ball jar. The chef came out and shook it. It was very small for a $10 salad and the dressing was so runny. Not much flavor. We left hungry."}
{"text":"Have been to Coronado cafe many many times and enjoyed the set up of tables and quiet home style house!  Have been three times and the service is slow and uncaring !! Had to flag wait staff down to locate drinks and at lunch hour to place order after waiting ten minutes .  Price point is too high for it's motif and certainly it's slow service! ( our table was joking that our waiter must have been high)   Benches outside gave me a sliver in pants that I worked on for the evening and it was so chilly we moved twice before we moved inside  Love the shaken salad but felt some of the displays for food I.e. Soup and grilled cheese were overwhelming and certainly mad e the grill cheese  and soup bland and underwhelming!!!!  Less is more!!  Good luck"}
{"text":"updating my review to 3 stars. we've eaten here six additional times. had some very good dinners that included fresh seafood. the standout, shark crudo. the brunch was terrific. however, the food is still inconsistent. once the salmon was undercooked and sent back. another, the nightly bag was disappointing, not bad seemed more like an after thought. the wine list needs work."}
{"text":"Since our so-so experience with the pork entree (looked pretty with the grill marks, but too dry due to the absence of sufficient fat or bone), we have ventured back to the Vine twice, and I am pleased to report that both visits were back up to the standards that we had come to expect from this innovative neighborhood restaurant.  Sampled the bag on our last visit with a delicious mushroom appetizer special and soup - all of which we shared, providing a generous meal for the two of us.  Only recommendation is to remember to ask for their tasty sour dough bread when you order soup, as it is served on request (so as not to waste it for those who don't want it).  No extra charge, just ask the server when you order..."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place if for no other silly reason than it's housed where one of my favorite lunch spots used to be and I had such high hopes based on the chef.   One of my pet peeves is food that is presented not as described. We ordered the daily bruschetta with what was described as roasted veggies. It was actually raw veggies, which is fine but don't say one thing and do another. Same with the bread pudding. Dried cranberries with white chocolate turned out to be blueberries and semisweet. I don't recall finding any dried cranberries, could be wrong. The arugula salad with pickled  beets lacked and the carne asada tacos were probably the tastiest thing we tried.   Friend says she will give it another try at dinner. Me? Sadly, no. So many restaurants, so little time."}
{"text":"We had dinner  there last night with a friend, it was our first visit to the restaurant since it opened. We live in the area and many new restaurants had opened recently and some of them are excellent. The staff was very friendly, our reservation got us a table immediately. The wine list was nice, but the one that we wanted was out of stock, which was a small disappointment. The wedge salad that I had was the best I ever had. It came in a large jar that the waitress mixed at our table. I had it with slices of steak that were tender and cooked perfect. My wife had the crab cake, but a single one with only a little Kale on it was not a filling meal, I suggest ordering a double if that is your entree. Our friend who had the meatloaf sandwich said it was very good, and she took some home in a take out box. I mistakenly left my Iphone at the table and when we called they had it secured and I was happy to get it back. We will be eating here a lot more in the future, its a homey place with great food, excellent service, and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We really had a great time here this week. Mo was so very wonderful and that helped...my husband and I were out without our son on a date...and that helps... BUT, let's start with DRINKS! So yummy!  I had this amazing cocktail with IPA beer in it and it was GREAT. The prices were reasonable (all less than 10.00) and the drink was strong enough to make me smile all through the most amazing food!  We didn't get a side, and I am not sure if we would have...the tapa plates were a tad more expensive than I had hoped for, but they were yummy.    I highly suggest this...in an area where there is a lot of competition this will definitely stand out."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to make it to Kai, but never made it in. When we heard chef Michael O'Dowd had left, it sort of lost its appeal. So I was very excited to read Howard Seftel's article about Urban Vine, and we called immediately. Unfortunately we couldn't get an early reservation but were told there was some space at the bar. Sold!   We went into Urban Vine, and had a real treat- chef O'Dowd was sitting and working at the bar next to us. We had a lovely conversation and he told us all about the restaurant remodel and the projects he has been working on (won't spoil the surprise). We had so much fun talking with him.  Urban Vine has had quite the redo since it was coranado cafe. The ceiling tin tiles were reclaimed from a building in CO, etc. Art is on display from local artists.  Upon Chef's recommendation we got the seafood in a bag chowder, which was delicious. We ordered quite a few dishes so that we could sample more of the menu. First up was the charcuterie- mainly from schreiner's - which was delicious. We ordered a Caesar salad (basic, I know) and it was also perfect. From there we had the seafood chowder, cheeseburger, bacon and maple covered dates and pork belly macaroni and cheese. Loved how several of the dishes were served in skillets.  Unfortunately, we couldn't stay for dessert, but will be back soon to tryout one of his superb creations!  Highly recommend and taking the time to enjoy the live music.b"}
{"text":"The black bean hummus has great glover!!! The carrots are soft and peeled.  Fresh plate!!"}
{"text":"Oh, Urban Vince... I think I'm in LOVE with you.  It's quaint, it's sweet, the flavors are robust and interesting- it's everything you need in a neighborhood restaurant. The outdoor patio is ready for some visitors, let's hope it cools down soon.   I enjoyed my New York strip. Maybe too much since I had planned on eating half and taking the rest home. Nope.  I ended up eating it all. I was able to try many other meals too (the joy of dining with friends!). The pasta dish was savory, I could eat an entire plate of the cabbage, rice noodle side- it was truly divine. The cakes were cooked perfectly. Dessert usually isn't my thing but I was impressed with the cobbler, and cobbler never impresses me.   The ambiance is really quaint, like you are at home and comfortable. You can tell a lot of thought went into design and decor. The tin ceiling, the light fixtures and wall decor are all visually appealing and kitschy.   I'm going back without a doubt. See ya there! Cheers."}
{"text":"Last weekend, my boyfriend and I swung by Urban & Vine to grab dinner before a movie. I had not been to Coronado Cafe before, but i was looking forward to checking out this new place. This restaurant definitely has a cozy and intimate ambiance, with low lighting and soft music playing.   Before we went, I was trying to decide whether or not to make a reservation but the mister thought since we were having dinner a little later it might not be necessary. Upon our arrival, I noticed an empty table right at the front so I felt relieved. However, we were asked if we made a reservation by the hostess and said no--she and another server (?) proceeded to go see if they could find a table for us. I started questioning whether or not reservations were required just to eat here since the vibe from them was not all that friendly. We were finally seated at the same empty table I spotted in the near the front part of the restaurant. I decided to put that aside and not let it bother me.   Our server was very helpful with presenting a laundry list of specials that I unfortunately cannot recall. Upon reviewing the menu, I thought that it must have been written by a literary scholar.. what did \"scented with greens mean?\" \"scented pita whaaa?\" Maybe this is a cooking term outside my realm. Honestly, it was on par with ordering food that looks good but you can't pronounce the name of the dish so you feel silly.   We ordered the black bean hummus as an appetizer. This was certainly an interesting choice as neither of us had eaten black bean hummus before.  It came with pickled vegetables, cucumber and pita bread. The hummus itself had a smokey flavor-almost as if liquid smoke had been added to it. I think it's a matter of personal preference that I didn't *love* it. I liked it, but prefer chickpea or garbanzo bean hummus.  For our dinner, I ordered the Fall Tomato Basil Bisque Soup with the melted cheese pita and greens. The tomato bisque was certainly delicious--I would have never expected to enjoy tomato soup with a toasted marshmallow on top! It was definitely eclectic and the star of my meal. The melted pita scented with greens was basically pita bread with melted cheese and topped with greens.(Yay for learning what scented meant). I also had a side of pearl couscous which was very tasty.   My boyfriend ordered the Sloppy Joe lean, which also came with greens and couscous. He enjoyed his dish and I got to try a bit as well because it's vegetarian! It was made with chickpeas..quite good.  When the bill came, we decided to split the check. For whatever reason, our server charged us WAY over the original cost for each of our bills. Our bill was around $50 total but we each had been charged $40. I am not sure how this happened?   Overall, I waver between 3 and 4 stars. The food was great (seriously! get the tomato bisque), however the service was a bit lackluster. From the situation with making a reservation when we arrived to that last snafu with the check, I would say that is my criticism. I wouldn't say that it would deter a return visit, I just hope to update this with more stars next time because I did love the food & ambiance of this place."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Urban Vine after having such a negative experience at MOD in Scottsdale. Everything that was overly modern, over done, over complicated, and ingredients used for shock value at MOD was simple, homey, and focused on fresh and seasonal ingredients at Urban Vine. Significant improvement.   We came in a bit late, but they were open. There wasn't anyone at the hostess stand and we waited for a bit to be seated. When someone did show up, they were a bit rude.... asking if we had a reservation (but in a way that sounded like.... you better have one), when the restaurant was mostly empty. We were seated on the patio and it was a bit cold. They use individual heaters for each table, but they don't produce a lot of heat. They also had a few fires going, which was a nice touch and made it smell amazing on the patio.    The menu looked great, with many tasty looking items to choose from, including many specials that all sounded like they used seasonal produce. We ended up ordering the tomato soup with the cheese flatbread, the beer cheese dip, and a steak special which was flank steak (I think) with a fresh mushroom polenta and micro greens. The best item we had was the steak, by far. It was well cooked and tasted amazing in the sauce they put on top and mixed with the polenta... yum. The mushrooms were perfect and tender. Overall it was great. The cheese dip with Noble bread was also delicious but cold when it came out.... I know it was cold outside, but that stuff must have been sitting for awhile. The flavor was good, the bread is (of course) high quality, and the beer/pepper flavors really came through. The soup was probably the least successful dish of the night.... it also came out kind of cold and was served with a marshmallow on top... sort of weird. The soup's flavor was ok, but nothing special. The salad that came with it was delicious, however, perfectly dressed. The pita was good (but you can't mess up cheese on bread). I probably wouldn't get this again. We finished with a Bailey's pot de creme with a salted caramel topping. The pot de creme was tasty, but a bit grainy. The salted caramel was delicious, but I think a chocolate or salted chocolate topping may have been a better match to the Bailey's flavor. All of this food only cost about 40$ and we were stuffed.   I would say I would come back; however, after seeing all of the negativity brought to this site by the owner I don't think I will. I don't need to give my money to someone who can't take a little criticism and make himself and his business better. Unfortunately for him, food critics don't keep restaurants afloat (see renegade by mod for example), real people do."}
{"text":"OMG,  OMG, OMG!!! One of my favorite new places! The best time to come here is on a weekend to avoid the lunch crowd.  Tiny bit fabulous.  Laid back atmosphere with friendly,  capable staff.  We came for some Saturday chill time & this place exceeded our expectations.   We had the cheese with local beer float (basically fondue with beer & sliced jalapeño) which is served with fresh lightly toasted artisan bread ~ delicious.  I had the Monte Vista cocktail, refreshing & fabulous.  We had Nutella cheesecake for dessert, absolutely heavenly."}
{"text":"The food was good and the atmosphere was nice as well. Feels like a wine bar more than a restaurant. Our server was a little scatterbrained but she made up for it with being very personable and even sitting down go chat.  The scallop cevice was really good but it lacked enough bread for vessels. we also had the cheese plate which also lacked some sort of vessel as it was literally a plate of cheese until we payed extra for some bread. The appetizers really need more bread or some chips or something.  the entrees were pretty fantastic. Someone below said they took \"liberties\" with the pork but I thought it was fantastic. If you want the classic take on classic dishes don't come here cause the food is adventurous and tasty. It was a bit pricey when all was said and done but if you want a low key dinner with quality food and decent portions and good atmosphere definitely try it out! Just be sure to pay for some extra bread...."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Food was good. I got the Grilled 8 oz Wagyu / Kobe Burger it was good a little messy but good. If I could add something it would be to have side options. Fries would have been nice. Still try it out! It is super cute and has a friendly environment."}
{"text":"LOVED this place the first time I went for lunch. Went back for dinner last week and was pretty disappointed in the tomato bisque, plus it wasn't very hot. Too expensive for how skimpy the meal was. Burger looked good and I love the atmosphere, so I will be back to try that!"}
{"text":"Would've given this a 2, but I don't usually do that unless the staff was unfriendly.  The staff was nice, but the appetizers were sub-par.  However, we enjoyed the meatloaf and tuna melt.  The prices were a little expensive for me and not to mention the waitress forgot to use the Yelp coupon on my receipt.  It took us a while to get out of there and instead of putting up a fuss, we just decided to pay and leave.    Entrees were great!  Appetizers were so-so, I would improve the appetizers, knowledge of using the Yelp coupon, and isolate the back rooms so the sound doesn't echo."}
