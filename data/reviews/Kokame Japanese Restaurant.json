{"text":"I need a place that can offer real sushi, for a moderately fair price. I took my Trinidadian friend for his first sushi experience since...his first sushi experience ten years ago. Apparently, it was very unpleasant. He described it to me like it was literally catching a fish out of water, and sinking his teeth into the thing.

Yeah. A small, individual booth sushi place is what I had in mind. I ordered all the most horrifying things to a sashimi virgin, and mixed the wasabi and soy sauce for him. This was proper sushi, served properly.

This was two months ago, now I can't get him off of my back about raw fish. He lived in the area, and this was obviously the best restaurant within a 5km distance. The service isn't fast, or slow. One can feel relaxed here, as the space drowns any outside noise. The price is as I said, moderate. No blue fin tuna, but definitely worth visiting after..say, a long and hard day at Yorkdale?

Bring your date, there's no chance of running into your ex here."}
{"text":"Okay, something happened, they closed for a while and have reopened.

The quality may have gone down a bit, too. Dang."}
{"text":"Place has been  sold!   New  place  is  called  Edamame.   Service ok but  food is a  disaster! 
Sushi  Restaurant no more...  Combination of  half effort  Japanese and  half  effort  Chinese with a  sprinkle  of  bad  American  fair  tossed in  for  poor  measure.  Don't  think that this place  will  survive with  current  state of  affairs.  I will never be  returning to  this place again!"}
{"text":"This was my very favorite local place for sushi but since they got shut down with a red card for gross unsanitary conditions, I haven't been able to bring myself to go back.

Can anyone reassure me that whatever problems they had were solved? Maybe the owner? I really miss their delicious sushi & amazing Crunch soup. My husband and I used to go at least once a week and can't find anywhere else nearly as good."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Best place for lunch between Dufferin/Wilson and Bathurst/Wilson. Cheap prices. LOTS of selection and good service. They just redid the inside so it is very open and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Live close-ish to Kokame and was less than happy with earlier experience a few years ago.  Big difference (for the better).  Fresh food, good quality rice, fresh seafood (hwae/sashimi) and almost friendly service.  Had hwae-dup-bap (sashimi don - sashimi salad with cho gochuchang) which was decent, except the cho gochuchang was way too sweet for my taste.  Observed other dishes which looked very good.  The kimchi was delicious, fish was fresh and nicely cut and they served a good quality green tea.  I will be back, for sure.  They are on the right track in terms of food quality.  Also seemed to be a very nice clientele which always makes the dining experience more pleasurable - i.e. no shrieking babies and cell phones ..."}
