{"text":"As a New Yorker I had never been to Killer Shrimp. I sat at the bar and food was amazing. Liz the bartender was on point, really friendly and I couldnt have asked for better drinks and service. I will def be back, was a great place all around!!!!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this restaurant because the previous reviews spoke poorly of the food and service.    I am glad that I stopped by. I had the mini crab cakes and they were delicious and full of fresh crab meat and herbs. The waitress was polite and the service was great! I recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp original \"peeled.\"  You still have to remove the tails but overall it was good.  The service was very good as well but this restaurant will have a hard time staying open if it keeps running out of things on the menu.  At lunch today they were out of 4 or 5 things.  Also the guy I was there with wanted dessert and the one he wanted they were out of as well.  Not to mention their computer system went down so they had to hand write his receipt for reimbursement purposes.  Not a great experience but I'd try it again simply because I liked the dish...which came with a basket of bread you can feed an army with."}
{"text":"Maybe growing up in the Pacific Northwest spoiled me when it comes to seafood.  Not to say there aren't good seafood choices in Vegas.  Unfortunately, this place isn't one of them.

Our server Mahsa was excellent.  Very attentive and friendly. When they didn't have the wine my wife ordered she brought out, without us asking, a sample of one she thought may be similar. 

The food was average.  The \"killer shrimp\" was not \"killer\" by any stretch. My wife's salmon was better than my shrimp, but wasn't excellent. Their specialty drinks were 80% ice.  The best thing we ate was the ahi appetizer.  That was delicious.

Overall, great service/average food."}
{"text":"***Dinner only****

Monday night, and I heard on the radio about this place that just opened up in town square and becoz I'm familiar with killer shrimp in CA I thought I would check this place out since I actually craved the broth from killer shrimp in CA. Anyways we get there, place is roomy and not busy, usually not a good sign but I mean the place is new so I said this is fine, I'm hungry and we get serviced rite away.  Hostess and server were great, service was fast and pleasant but the food I wasn't to impressed with. Just missed happy hour, but I decided to have a drink, they're KS Mojito was really good.  we had the calamari that was good with a surprisingly spicy ranch, and killer fries. those were good too, luv Cajun spices!! I had the killer shrimp original *shelled*, I wasn't impressed. The broth was to spicy for me but I dealt with it, it took away from enjoying the flavors in the broth, the shrimp was tough like it was overcooked and the \"French\" bread was eh, tasted store bought. ANYWAYS, overall experience was ok coz the servers were nice and I'm guessing it was the manager on shift but someone came over and greeted us and saw how we were doing. lucky for me, on Monday nights they have a special on they're killer shrimp I guess they bring down the price to its \"original\" price whatever that means and so I guess for the price it was ok.  becoz I try everything twice just to make sure I DONT like it then i'll be stopping again to see how I feel about this place. maybe i'll stop by the CA location again and compare."}
{"text":"Love this place, delicious dishes, friendly service, happy with every visit.  Happy Hour is great, just saw a coupon from Groupon, happy happy joy joy!"}
{"text":"Food was great,  but service from waitress Cassandra was incredible.  Would recommend the Shrimp in broth.  Would've given 5 stars, but lobster tail seemed overcooked."}
{"text":"Well what can I say I am only giving three stars because the staff and manager was great!! We ordered the raw oysters which were good the peel n eat shrimp which tasted like pure Rosemary it just was to overpowering.  I also ordered the killer shrimp shelled and while it looked amazing it lacked flavor except heat in my mouth. I really wish it had more of a garlic taste or some kind of flavor it just fell short for me.  I know it's only been open for a week but again the staff is great but everything just needed a little more flavor."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. As we entered the restaurant, there was no one at the podium to greet us. We went in and no one addressed us. There was one waiter laughing and hanging onto two ladies (guests) and no one else. We walked to the bar and had to call the bartender for assistance. He said to go outside and someone should be with us. We were seated ordeted ice tea but didn't get any sugar. Asked the waitress for sugar but never got it. Went inside to get the sugar myself but no workers were around. I walked around the bar and 3 employees came out from the back. I asked one of them for sugar and she gave me a look like she wanted to beat me. Our salad finally came and was drenched with liquid. The boiled eggs had green rings around the yolk. I brought it to the guys attention and he said that's how it is. The workers are all young, dumb and don't give a shit. We had to ask for silverware and drinks. The only thing killer is the service, which will kill them if they don't change. 
On a positive note, my paella was great."}
{"text":"Nastiest restaurant I've ever worked in place isn't empty for a reason don't get sick eating here...."}
{"text":"Yum...YUM!!! Holy seafood! Delicious! The killer shrimp was KILLER! Spicy, succulent and the seafood salad was the best ever with warm calamari, shrimp and crab. The dressing was perfection! Gabby, our server was great! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Killer Shrimp. Chelsey did excellent job explaining menu and service. All food was great - chowder, oysters, shrimp crab and lobster bowl. We will go back."}
{"text":"We wanted to eat some where in town square and everything else was packed on a friday night except for killer shrimp.  Well it was a killer alright the food was average and the service was horrible.  The bartender on friday night seems to be mad at the world and the food servers can't give you any input on the items on the menu except that its a popular item. Its a great location but they need to educate the servers on the menu. I dont blame them its just poorly managed."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order the \"Peel and Eat\" shrimp. Killer. 

Wife, 13-month-old son and I have stopped in twice since they've opened and both times the staff has been awesome, ambience has been wonderful, and food's been great. Highly recommend, we're happy to have another delicious option in Town Square."}
{"text":"Stopped in at killer shrimp after a movie.  Nice little spot in Town Square. It's a seafood place with a southern vibe.  I had the killer shrimp original, which is shell on shrimp in an awesome, spicy broth.  You get french bread to sop up all the goodness and can add pasta or rice if you like, but the bread is perfect for cleaning the bowl to the last drop.  We also got the coconut shrimp, which was tasty too, but the bowls are where it's at. The servers are great too.  If you get Tina as yours, consider yourself lucky."}
{"text":"My daughter and I tried out Killer Shrimp last night prior to a movie. It as Happy Hour so we had a few appetizers and drinks. The server forgot my glass of wine but it came when the food did.  One of the appetizers we found had too much fried coating on it, so we didn't eat much of it. Otherwise it was all ok. What I did really respect, is that a gentleman who I think might be a manager, could sight of her and I not being keen on that appetizer. I saw him go towards the server, and when she appeared with the bill, they had taken it off. That is considerable customer service and very commendable. We are going to go back next week and give it another try, but this time try some of the entrees that they specialize in. Good job in recapturing a customer they might have otherwise lost."}
{"text":"Just finished an early dinner with my husband at Killer Shrimp. The best part of our meal was Cassandra, our server. She was very energetic, happy & caring! Next was the $10 add-on lobster tail. Although small, the lobster tail was sweet & yummy! I definitely recommend paying the extra $2 to have your shrimp shelled. Only having to worry about the tails, makes a much easier to eat meal!  I can't imagine having to take the shrimp out of the broth & peel it! My husband enjoyed the braised short rib entree. If you order asparagus, I recommend you ask for melted butter, as it seemed to have no butter. Again, Cassandra made the entire meal outstanding with her service!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming at best.  Very expensive for what you get along with slow and mediocre service.  When we got there the woman who greeted us was very nice (not a hostess though, don't know where she was) as was the server.  We ordered the killer shrimp with rice, lobster ravioli with spinach salad to start.  25 minutes later, we still didn't have our salad and our server hadn't been seen or stopped by in at least 15 minutes.  We had a 3 year old in tow and to keep him entertained for long periods of time while we try to enjoy a meal is tough, so very slow service is always annoying to us.  The salad finally came and while tasty, it was absolutely drenched in dressing (our bad for not ordering it on the side like we normally do, but I don't know why they always feel the need to drown the salad in dressing!).  Another 10-15 minutes and our food came.  My wife's lobster ravioli actually was tasty but was a fairly small serving for the price.  My killer shrimp was just a 10-15 overcooked shrimp in a vat of fairly tasteless and generically spicy sauce.  THIS is their \"signature\" sauce that supposedly takes hours to prepare?  It tasted like salty chicken broth, oil, cayenne pepper and maybe some other unidentifiable spices thrown in.  Nothing to write home about at all.  They serve it with french bread which is the very cheap, low quality, tasteless .99 a loaf @Walmart type.  Not impressed at all.  With two glasses of mid-priced wine, our bill topped $70 so with tax and tip we were around $90 for this...VERY expensive for the quality, the portions and the mediocre service!  Seems this is a common experience from the many other reviews here which essentially say the same thing (bad service, average at best food).  I think this place will (and should) be another casualty just like all of the previous restaurants that have failed at this exact spot.  I know we won't ever return as there are several FAR better options at Town Square for dining."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. I agree with previous reviews about the bread needing to be toasted or something. The broth was a little too watery for me if you order it with the pasta or rice but for dipping bread in its good. Just a little warning for those of you that can't handle heat, it's a little on the spicy side which I like, but for my girlfriends, it was a little too spicy and they only have one heat level. I will most likely be going back to try other things on the menu but since it was my first visit at a place called killer shrimp I figured I had to order the shrimp."}
{"text":"Food average. Drinks average. Service nice but the SLOWEST I have ever experienced. There was maybe 20-25 people eating there but almost 45 minutes just for bread pudding! Tons of waitstaff wandering around aimlessly."}
{"text":"Awful service. Food was pretty good but the bad service was so bad... i won't go back."}
{"text":"Host Mika was Awesome,,, food beyond great! I had the fried shrimp,,,love the batter,,,and the seafood bowl. ...yes!"}
{"text":"This place has killer shrimp! A bit spicy if that's what you like, the scallops were Delish and Laura our server is amazing, she keeps those wonderful shrimp killas coming!"}
{"text":"I had been to the Killer Shrimp in California probably 15 years ago so I was excited to try it again as I still remember how great it was.  This location in Town Square has had much turnover.  It doesn't have the greatest atmosphere and Killer Shrimp didn't remodel.  We arrived on a Saturday night around 6:00.  It wasn't crowded at all.  We were seated immediately, but we waited at least 20 minutes, it was very warm and no one came to our table after the hostess seated us.  Finally we got up to ask someone and it was the manager, she got us a server right away.  The server was new, most likely never in this position before and while she was attentive and friendly, she didn't know the menu well or how to handle some of our questions, we had someone who needed help with gluten free options.  Instead of offering to find out our questions she just said no.  Overall she was fine, just needs a bit more time.  The manager sent over a shrimp cocktail appetizer to apologize for our wait and it was very good.  Big pieces of shrimp along with a dish of chopped shrimp and cucumber mixed with cocktail sauce and served with tortilla chips. At our table we had orders of the killer shrimp, one with rice, one with pasta and then an order of the roasted chicken.  One order of killer shrimp was too spicy but mine (with noodles) was great.  It was spicy but really good, I made the mistake of not getting it shelled, the way the menu read it didn't have the option for the shelled with pasta or rice, next time I'll ask.  Also the temperature was so hot it was difficult to eat for quite some time.  The bread was a disappointment.  Very generic and nothing great, I seriously was expecting better.  The roasted chicken came with mashed potatoes and asparagus and was great.  While we had several glitches, I loved the killer shrimp and pasta and my boyfriend was very impressed with his roasted chicken, we will most likely try it again."}
{"text":"The habanero tartar sauce is too spicy, the paella was bland, crab cakes were undercooked. I thought it inappropriate the greeter had on daisy dukes - it's not a Hooters!"}
{"text":"2nd visit to Killer Shrimp in Town Square. Our server was Kindra and I can say with confidence (because I eat out often) that she's one of the best servers I've encountered. Kindra demonstrates knowledge about the establishment's food/beverages both in their recipes and general background when it comes to the history of Killer Shrimp.  She brings to her guests an engaging, warm, and positive attitude. Since I've only been to the restaurant in the mid-afternoon & into the evening, service can be a bit slow and I don't know if that's simply a reflection of staffing or not, but in spite of it, Kindra takes it all in stride focusing on guest needs.  I spoke with the manager upon leaving Killer Shrimp, praising this server because I think that often when diners have good experiences, they fail to share it with the one person who needs to know it. Killer Shrimp has *DELICIOUS* food and FANTASTIC lemon-drop martinis so if you visit, get whatever it is you LOVE in terms of seafood and ask to sit in Kindra's section of the restaurant. I will absolutely be returning!"}
{"text":"The place is based on bread dipped into a broth that has shrimp in it. Without the bread, you're getting very little food, just some shrimp. The bread..well...it sucks. It's not heated up at all, no crunch on the outside, spongy and flavorless.

The broth is okay, and the shrimp is just boiled shrimp--there's nothing \"killer\" about the broth or the shrimp itself.

The service was decent, but the dish we had came with corn, and we had to ask for it--the kitchen didn't send it out, and we were one of two parties in the place early on a Wednesday evening.

I have to say that it's a pleasant atmosphere, but we'll never be back, it's not worth the drive or the money."}
{"text":"The location is not optimal for out-of-town folks as it is not on the strip. Food was excellent however. I came here after a night of heavy drink with a appetite. I started with the seafood salad. The portion was huge. The seafood was a combination of shrimp, calamari, and crab meat lightly sauteed and on bed of romaine lettuce, cucumber, tomato, and egg, dressed in spicy thousand island. The dressing had a nice kick to it. I think to the casual diner it may be a bit too spicy. My only knock on the salad was the less than fresh cucumber. For entree, I had the Fisherman's stew and added a lobster tail. The stew was the best seafood stew I have had. Tons of rich tomato flavor, no too creamy. Loaded with clams. mussel, scallop, salmon, crab and whole lobster tail (the lobster is $10 extra). Comes with buttered toasted french bread for dunking in the broth. Overall, a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Rice was old! I asked for a new rice but the cooks had thrown out the rice for the night, so I was left with cold and crunchy rice. The shrimp was overlooked and chewy because it had been de-shelled (tails on). The restaurant was dead, only one other table was there besides us on a Wednesday night at 9:30pm. When you walk in, the place had a very overwhelming smell of bleach and or ammonia."}
{"text":"Rude staff, lack in inventory, served a dish without all ingredients listed on the menu.  I reported it to management via email. They left a phone number for my to call. I called twice and was not able to reach them, so I sent them another email, and all they had to say was try calling us again. What a joke!"}
{"text":"I am in heaven!  It is the exact same as the first one that opened near me in Marina del Rey around 20 years ago. I loved it then and now I love it here in Vegas!  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Horrible service. Over Priced. When the waiter asked how it was, I told him terrible. He did nothing to try to remedy it. Didn't offer a price adjustment or another item off the menu. Now I know why the restaurant was empty when we went in. Don't waste your time or money going to this place."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese was the only high point of our experience.  The bread was dry and crumbly, the sauce was bland, and the staff outnumbered the guests by a good amount, yet we could never get a simple bottle of beer in under 10 minutes.  fyi - we went back in January, so perhaps they've changed improved on some things. . ."}
{"text":"Been there twice now. Both times food and service were really good! Finally a place I can go with my baby and enjoy food in Town Square that isn't pizza or hamburgers..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this meal very much.  We sat on the patio and were blessed with a bubbly waitress named Cassandra.  She was very quick with recommendations.  The Killer Shrimp was great.  The seafood salad was so fresh and delicious and paired nicely with a killer margarita.  Please,order the lobster Mac-n-cheese...you'll only be sorry when it's all gone"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner. For appetizers, we both had the mini crab cakes and my husband had a small cup of clam chowder. Both were very deliciious. For the entrees, i had the Angus sliders and my husband had the Original Killer Shrimp. If you like Cajun spices, then you will like the shrimp. The sliders were okay but not great. We ended dinner with the apple cobbler which was out of this world."}
{"text":"***update*** 
Don't understand some of these crazy negative reviews, they sound a bit far fetched. 

I've gone here now 4 times since it's opened. 

I will agree that they seem to be slow in service some nights, but seems it's because they are understaffed? Which ... It's a restaurant ppl, that tends to happen from time to time. At least they were understaffed when we went there for lunch once, but the food was good just took a while. 

The other times I've had great, attentive, friendly service. I love sitting at the bar. I think you get served faster. The bartenders are all friendly and hard working as well as the rest of the staff. 

The clam chowder second time having it And The bartender suggested I add Habanero sauce and I have to say it's awesome wth the hot sauce so I reviewed it again lol. 

I've had the killer shrimp and it was good but personally I lovedddd the fisherman's stew. I think it's superior to the killer shrimp dish but that's just my personal preference. The broth is amazing, love the spiciness. Some reviewed that that they hated it but If you love spicy Cajun flavor you'll dig it. 

The oysters are great and fresh. I would recommend those on their happy our menu.
--------

I had The Westside, one of their speciality drinks. Sarah was my bartender and she was awesome. The drink was good, refreshing and on their Happy Hour menu which is 3-6 & 10- midnight. Happy hour is worth it. Speciality drink of the day is only $5 bucks! 


I'll have to come back and try all the different things on the menu including the drinks! Hopefully this place sticks, I like having a seafood option! I always order the chowder at Yardhouse but I think I might start going here instead!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was wonderful.  That's about it however.

My wife and I both got their signature shrimp in the fiery sauce with rice.  For $18 I would have wanted shrimp that was of a higher quality.  It wasn't horrible just not as good as I would have expected.  The sauce was spicy as advertised.  Other than that it was bland.  No flavor.  I wanted to enjoy the sauce but ended up eating only the shrimp for dinner.  

Other dishes may have been a better choice but we both left hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"Went with my friend to Town Squares' theater and noticed this new place.Killer Shrimp sounds interesting:) after we watched a movie we decided to try this place. It was almost 8PM on a Sunday and there were only 3-4 customers, so service was fast :) . I ordered Blackened Salmon and it was delicious!! Waitress was very nice and the manager came up to chat with us a bit . Nice people, nice food. Hopefully it will get busier though."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour, nice open seating area. We ordered the oysters to start, they were fresh very good. We then ordered the fish and shrimp tacos along with the calamari. Both tacos were fantastic good portion of both. The calamari was also good. We had dos xx very cold. Service was a little slow and it wasn't that busy, other than that the staff was very nice. Will come again to try the mussels."}
{"text":"Sad news. Went by Friday 9/30/16 for dinner and found the place entirely closed. Tried calling the phone number with no answer. Sorry to have missed you Killer Shrimp. You're truly one of a kind. We hope you're able to reopen at another location in the LV area."}
{"text":"In Vegas for the Halloween weekend festivities and stumbled upon this hometown hero. Killer Shrimp is a fav of mine at home so we had to swoop in. This place just opened so there are kinks to work out and it doesn't have the same vibe as the one in Marina Del Rey, but it has great potential. 
My girlfriend and I shared a salad and the Mac n cheese and both were so, so good. The food did take a long time to come out, but it was worth it. I'm always used to great service here and the staff was awesome. Gaby took stellar care of us at the bar.
This will be a stop for me every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"We were walking by and we saw this place and decided to check it out. We walked in, and the place looked great. Great art and music, it was better than we'd expected. The service was great, and we got our food within minutes. The food was definitely the best seafood I've ever had. This place is definitely worth checking out, definitely going to come back soon."}
{"text":"Had high expectations bc as soon as we walked in it smelled so good!! Here comes the but, as soon as we walk in, there was no hostess to great and seat us considering it was pretty empty on a Tuesday dinner service. So we proceeded to seat ourselves. We ordered drinks and appetizers, clearly our drinks were forgotten about and had to remind our waiter about it, esp when our appetizers already came. I ordered the Paella and my bf ordered the fried shrimp. When our orders came, to our surprise my bf's plate  came over loaded with fries and  6 shrimp. For $17 it was quite disappointing. It so ridiculous with what they charge and that's all you get. So we asked our waiter if the platter only come with 6 shrimp and she very bluntly yes I GOT A LOT of complaints about that and walked away, showing no remorse that I was obviously disappointed with our dish. If she already got multiple complaints about it she could  have warn us when we were ordering. After that her attitude completely change and wasn't very accommodating all.  It's expensive for no reason. If you want your money's worth go somewhere else that'll give you more than 6 shrimp for $17. Completely disappointed and will never come back."}
{"text":"I've seen this space get transformed into countless numbers of restaurants/bars. I went in without thinking much of it. Got my popcorn shrimp appetizer and was shocked at how amazingly addicting they were.  Being more of a beef eater than seafood I ordered a steak while my friends ordered the coconut shrimp and the waitress recommended the fisherman's stew. I tried their plates and while my steak was amazing..I actually wish I had gone the seafood route it was that yummy! Everything I tasted was amazing and I find myself craving killer shrimp now! I pray this place stays!"}
{"text":"I love seafood so had to try it. Went with my husband on a Monday afternoon at 3. The restaurant was completely empty. Was wondering if they were even open ( the hostess/server assured me they were. ) Happy hour had just started so we ordered from there. Popcorn shrimp, angus sliders and steamed mussels. Shrimp were fried perfectly and had a nice kick to them, husband enjoyed his sliders but the mussels while having good flavor were not cleaned properly ( some of the beards were left on) they also did not have a great beer selection. Will try one more time I think and give an update."}
{"text":"Every time I walk through Town Square and see this place, I always get curious about it. Finally decided to try it out and I absolutely love the food.

The lobster mac n cheese is literally their best dish. I highly recommend it. It is extra cheesy and the lobster meat tastes very well with this dish. Their street corn is spicy but very tasty, and it may just be me, but I am almost positive it had crab meat on it. Their signature Killer Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta is very delicious. The dish is spicy and served in a broth, but if you can handle it, I guarantee you'll love it. Their clam chowder was a little bland, but if you're like me and like your soups less salty, then it will be perfect for you. The spinach salad was also very delicious (because it had bacon).

Their service though...I cannot express how disappointed I was in this place. I came up to the hostess stand to get a table and the hostess kept standing there cleaning menus and ignoring the customers standing in front of her. I proceeded to walk inside the restaurant where still no one notice my group, it was not until I walk to the bartender at the bar and asked for a table, did I finally get seated. In addition, my group waited at the table forever before anyone came to take our order. Once our food was out, all the employees disappeared into the kitchen or something. When we were done with our meal, I had to hunt down one of the workers to get the check. I have never had such bad experience with service in my entire life, I might as well just walk into the kitchen and cook my own food..."}
{"text":"I was at Killer Shrimp over the weekend for my first time. It was great food and reasonably priced. Liz was our server, she was very friendly and took great care of us. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ehhh. 1/2 of the food was good 1/2 wasn't. Service was slow. We waited 20 minutes for our check after we were done. The lobster Mac n cheese was great but the scallops were not. Drinks took forever and we wanted to be drunk. Not a great experience but not horribly bad either so ehhhh"}
{"text":"The food and service were good. I got the short rib...one of my favorite cuts of meat. It was nice and tender and huge! I wasn't crazy about the sauce, and it was a bit too rich if you ate too much. I still enjoyed the short rib, though. It sat on top of a bed of mashed potatoes and spinach, which was also good. We also got the crab cake appetizers. Those were also tasty."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and so was the service.  Our waitress Mika was wonderful as was the manager.  We had the lobster Mac and cheese (fantastic and huge portions), seafood salad, chowder and killer shrimp.  We will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I've been feenin for a seafood fix ever since I moved here to Vegas. I found crab corner through groupon and although the crab dish was plenty tasty, it still wasn't fulfilling. Fast forward a couple of months and thanks again through groupon, I found killer shrimp. The killer shrimp original (she'll on) was the best out of the 3 dishes I ordered. They have their own special broth where the shrimp swim in and although it's supposed to be very spicy (7 out of 10 level) after the 1st initial kick, the heatspice actually just goes to the back when eating the rest of the shrimp. Don't forget to sop your bread in the broth too, it's that tasty. The 2nd dish was the paella with risotto. Another tasty dish w/mussels, clams, calamari, chicken, sausage, onions and red bells. My only complaint was that some of the risotto was just a tad firm still, but like I said that's a very tiny complaint. The last dish we had was the cod beer battered fish n chips. The fries were skinny w/just the right amount of salt and the texture was perfectly crisp. The cod itself was just a little on the rubbery side, which would be my biggest complaint of the night. Oh yeah a plus for the habanero tartar sauce which wasn't spicy at all, just flavorful. Our server Twyla  was very friendly and helpful, especially with the menu's breakdown of the killer dishes. The manager came out to meet us briefly and then at the end of the dinner to take care of my groupon. If your looking for a new simple seafood place then please consider this. I'll be back for sure especially to try their desserts which my stomach just didn't have any room for tonight."}
{"text":"Have been there several times with my family. Cassandra was the best waitress. She checked on us frequently (but not too much), kept our table clear, refilled our drinks & brought our food out quickly. She's super friendly. Thank you Cassandra."}
{"text":"So yummy!!! Genesis was so nice and so patient with us as new customers. She had great suggestions and we were very satisfied with everything we ordered, food and drink."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. Nothing special from start to finish.
1. Hostess was very blah. Not very friendly nor welcoming but not rude or anything, just there.
2. Server was very forgetful and a lil condescending. Ask for lemons for my water, forgot.
Butter for my bread my bread, forgot 
Basic utensils for my oysters and lobster, forgot
The worse thing was I ordered a Coke it was flat so I just declined and stuck with water but when the check came the charge was still on the bill n when I mention the Coke still being on the check, I kinda got a \"look\".
3. As for the most important part the food.... It was nothing worth coming back for. Wasn't horrible but mid grade all the way down to the one dimensional flavors and the passable freshness of seafood. Not good enough to rave about but not bad enough to make you sick.
I give this no more than a year before the doors close for good."}
{"text":"Bummed I had to give them 3 stars but here's the deal!! 

Being a Hermosa Beach transplant, I was very excited to hear that Killer Shrimp was coming to Vegas. 
I had spent many a day/night (more than I want to admit) over the years hanging out with my friends, at their marina location.
Chillin outside, drinking and eating the best seafood in all of So Cal, with great service and most importantly, the overall feeling of it being our hang spot, was something we all truly enjoyed and looked forward to. 

So we rolled in for dinner at the new Town Square location with great anticipation!!
What a different vibe when we entered! Gone was the cool, comfortable, atmosphere we were so used to relaxing in for hours on end. 
It had been replaced by this dark, cold, empty feeling, imposter of a place that had no relationship to the roots of which it came.
I know we're in Vegas, but what does Jazz and Rat Pack paintings on the walls have anything to do with a beach establishment named Killer Shrimp?

The server Lisa rocked, which helped bring a little of that lost memory back, as we were all still in shock.
Most importantly...Thankfully the food had not changed a bit (at least they didn't screw with that). The Shrimp Bowl was everything I remember and missed so dearly and the apps were spot on. Drinks... Could have used half the ice, but we're great! 

Hopefully people will give this place a try for its food which is Awesome!! And maybe management will \"figure it out\" and do a little through back to what made them the coolest BEACH HANG in the South Bay!! Cause we don't need another Vegasized establishment!"}
{"text":"Great new spot in Town Square. Love the clam chowder. The shrimp dishes I had both times I was here were very good. If you're looking for a fine dining seafood place, this isn't it. But it is very good, with friendly staff and good prices. Happy Hour provides good prices on food and drinks."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Horrible service. Hardly anyone there and waitress forgets our appetizer and had to repeatedly ask for our drinks. No cool atmosphere or friendly people as we were expecting since we used to go to one in L.A. Wouldn't recommend it or spend another dime here."}
{"text":"I saw this place on Groupon & figured we could check it out for dinner. Called to see if we needed reservations for this place on a Saturday night. The hostess said we don't need to have a reservation, but they were on a 20 minute wait. When we arrived the place was about 25% sat. 
When we were sat we were next to the bar. The bartender actually was our waitress because that was her area as well. The hostess didn't ask if we wanted to sit at the bar even though we were that close & the bartender would have to serve us. Because of this the bartender had to make 2 drinks then run them to us, then do the same again. Not to mention she's running the bar for the whole place. Once drinks were served we ordered the lobster mac & cheese. There was nothing left of it minutes after it was served. SO GOOD!
For dinner I ordered the Blackened Salmon Fillet (Maple scented brown butter sweet potatoes and wilted spinach) & my buddy got the Killer Paella (Saffron rice, andouille sausage, chicken, clams, mussels, calamari and shrimp). My salmon was so tender & the seasonings popped once it landed on your tongue. Sadly my buddy was not a fan of the Killer Paella as the saffron is on EVERYTHING & it takes away from the dish. It's just to overpowering. The staff was kind enough to replace the dish since they could see he wasn't enjoying his meal. 
The staff here is very friendly. Def will be back to check out happy hour."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It's hard to see this physical spot have so many restaurants that go through, but I hope Killer Shrimp stays.

We went with a group of 6 and 3 people in our party tried their classic shrimp bowls. (I forgot what they call them on the menu, it's at the top.) My husband LOVED it. I thought the menu was a nice size and had the right amount of options for different palates.

Although the beer on tap was going through inconvenient maintenance at the time of our visit,  we were willing to look the other way because the service was great. Our waitress checked in on us regularly and the runners who brought food were careful and able to help us with little things here and there that we needed.

The restaurant was clean and so was the bathroom. Great open space and funky Las Vegas decorations. 

It's worth a try, even if you're not a huge seafood person!"}
{"text":"I had the fish and chips and lobster Mac and cheese both were great! 
Also ask a server the story behind Killer Shrimp! :) the story of how it started will make you adore the place even more."}
{"text":"Service was great, killer shrimp  entress were absolutely bad. Unedible. Unexplainable."}
{"text":"Had the killer shrimp bowl with crab and lobster was  delicious great flavor. The server mika was great very attentive and friendly server.."}
{"text":"Came here with Hubby in November 2015. The food and service was awesome. The place is clean, well maintained and decorated nicely.

I had the most tender beef rib it was soooooo good.

Would definitely come back again the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day for HH. Clam chowder and calamari was awesome, so was the price. They don't give you a slice of bread they give you the whole bread. Got the Killer shrimp, it  was okay. Hubby got the killer shrimp
Pasta. Sauce does throw it off, I'd order the killer shrimp as a appetizer. Almost like a boiling crab just fancier"}
{"text":"went for the happy hr treats . the asada tacos were bland shrimp were better . service was pretty good but the food was average being nice ,dont even remember the calamari which is one of my favs while dining out ."}
{"text":"Ate there last night.  Had the basic killer shrimp.  Knew that they would be in broth because of the menu desc but they had the shell on.  At the \"other\" on the shell places, they give you gloves.  Here...no...just some wet naps and napkins.  Very messy.  Sause/broth was just okay as far as flavor.  Slightly spicy. There were a lot of shrimp...just not my type of thing.  They had lobster tails on the menu but not by themselves.  Wish they were but oh well.  Wish there was a vegetable offered with. Just shrimp and bread.  Bread wasn't warm.  Lots of it though."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. Wow, excellent food and great service. Can't ask for more.  The seafood stew was incredible!"}
{"text":"The food was good but it is quite expensive which is probably why I won't be eating there often. I didn't get a chance to try the oysters either because they ran out. Other than that I have no other complaints and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Monday's are the best days to go with half price on the original or shelled killer shrimp bowl of deliciousness! I have been going to the killer shrimp in la for years and was so happy they came to Las Vegas! Just as good as I remembered! Why only four stars , you ask? I got charged for two ice teas! Took to long to get cocktails. Kinda pricy but I knew that!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night, not busy at all but was sat in the middle of the restaurant. We were seated about 7 minutes before a server came over to greet us. I only learned her name when we paid for the bill. When she did come over she didn't introduce herself but took our drink orders which consisted of water with lemons and an iced tea. We got our drinks about 15 minutes later, again restaurant was not busy. We ordered the calamari, which was ok. Caesar salad which was bland, the killer shrimp with lobster and crab and then my boyfriends mom ordered a wedge salad and the pan roasted chicken. They almost brought all the food out at the same time, then our server forgot the roasted chicken and by that time we didn't want it anymore. We had to ask for refill on water twice and once the food came we were not asked if we needed anything else. Everything was just okay..had the service been great, we would have given a better review, we probably will not be back just for lack of service on a slow night. Couldn't imagine what the service would be like during a busy time!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the seafood combo that comes with shrimp, lobster and crab. It came in a bowl and a side of bread. The lobster was over cooked stuck in the shell, so was the shrimp. It was on the rubbery side. The sauce was bland and nothing killer about it. The bread, wasn't fresh or toasted, it was just white bread sliced up. The service was good, the food and concept here is horrible."}
{"text":"YUMMY! Came in for lunch and took advantage of the Happy Hour specials and OG day...entrees were half price. Tried the clam chowder (delightful!), calamari and Shelled Killer Shrimp (they shell it for you)... Everything was top shelf and we highly recommend it to our family & friends !  We will be back to try the rest of the menu items which were many!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour on a Sunday with a group of people. Since there was only 1 other small table in the restaurant the waitress was really attentive to our group. Disappointed that they do not have any of their \"Killer Shrimp\" on the happy hour menu as a small portion. $17 for the Killer Shrimp on the regular menu is just too expensive when you're in for a happy hour especially after ordering a drink. Ordered the Shrimp Tacos & Clam Chowder. Wasn't really impressed with the taste of either. The tacos needed more seasoning to make the flavor come out & no salt & pepper on the tables. Was impressed with amount of shrimp on the tacos at least. Wasn't a measly 2-3. Each taco had 5-6 shrimp on them. Chowder wasn't anything to write home about. Best Chowder I've ever had was at an Irish restaurant in Minnesota. Decent prices on drinks for happy hour. $3.50 domestics & they have a few that aren't the normal Miller Lite, Coors Light, etc. Others in my group raved about their food (see pics). I'd go back for the cheap beers & maybe to split a Killer Shrimp dish with a friend."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing. Went on a Saturday night and it was not busy at all. Sometimes service was a little slow, but the waitress we had always made up for it. Great place!"}
{"text":"I wish I Could remember the name of my server bartender and manager because they were amazing. I went May 22nd or 23rd. I thought they closed at midnight so I arrived at 9:57 when they close at 10, and they let me in with a smile. We had a groupon to try them, and I've never really had much seafood before but omg it was the best thing I had ever tasted. Everything looked fresh and colorful and was delicious. I have never eaten as well as I did at this place. And the whole time the server described what we should get and her favorite dishes and the bartender recommended drinks, they both had such passion. On top of it, the manager let us use our coupons without any issues. She was also very spirited. You know who you are, I'm sorry I've forgotten your names. Thank you for the best food and experience I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my trip to Killer Shrimp. The prices for the amount of food you receive is crazy. Although the Shrimp Cocktail was very good, I ordered the Lobster Ravioli which was served on a UFO sized plate. On that huge plate was 6 neatly placed ravioli that could and should have been on the childrens menu. $21 for something i could eat in 2 fork fulls is retarded. I will not be returning to this place. As a local Vegas resident, this is on my \"no go\" list."}
{"text":"I read some mixed reviews on this place, but was willing to give it a shot because the menu items sounded good.  The service was great and timely.  I had a reservation through Open Table and they were sure to make sure I got my \"credit.\"  We ordered the sweet potato fries which were probably the best I've ever had--light, crispy and salty.  We also had the lobster Mac and cheese and it was awesome.  The three of us got the peeled shrimp bowls.  The shrimp comes in a bowl of spicy broth and you get a large bowl of French bread.  I loved the flavor and you get a ton of shrimp.  We will go back for a few other choices!"}
{"text":"Cassandra the server was amazing and very attentive to the fact to the fact that we had kids. I didn't even have to ask for water for them. As soon as we were seated she had waters for me and my wife as well as our kids. She was very knowledgable about the restaurant and the food was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Good food!! Horrible service !!!!!!!! I been here 5 times and staff do not pay attention to me , some times take about 20 min to take my order and another 20 to get my food with no customers inside , I just keep coming for the food"}
{"text":"Killer shrimp is so delicious!!! Not like those seafood places that throw seafood in a bag with butter and spice, this shrimp is complex and amazing! Get some bread to dip in the sauce you will not regret it! Love the music and laid back vibe!"}
{"text":"Killer Shrimp, Lasvegas, Nv
I'm going to miss the resturant! Loved the food and the customer service!  The shrimp broth makes the meal so don't be \"chintzy\" even if customers have to pay extra!!  

Come back in 2017, maybe at the Linq promenade
China town, or  even downtown. The rent is little more expensive, but you will have more  people walking traffic coming in the door to make the business a success!"}
{"text":"Great taste, good service, good drinks. This location in town square makes me nervous but I would definitely go again. We tried vegan options, many different drinks in our group and various different entrees. Everyone loved their food. It is definitely worth a try and I hope it lasts!!"}
{"text":"Went here on opening night. They had drink specials which was nice, and maybe this helped to bump the review up from a 3 to a 4.
We were not that impressed really with the Shrimp. It was okay, but nothing too exciting. The bread was just cheap white french bread, but the broth we dipped it in was yummy. Also service was super super friendly!"}
{"text":"the building itself has kind of a modern art deco feel. lots of paintings and pictures of bands, graffiti, etc. mostly muted black and gray color scheme with patterned faux metal on the hunt dealing. There is  full service bar in the center of the room with booths and tables around the perimeter of the room. 

Everything is clean and new. Service was great and the food was decently priced and tasted good."}
{"text":"Service was very good, location was good, nice place for groups. Beers were perfect.
The food was good but missed flavour for the price. The killer shrimp bowl was a nice spicy broth with good shrimp in it, but missed that extra.
All in all it was OK but flavours were a little bland for the price of the food. Would not come back if I didn't use the Groupon 30$ for 50$ deal."}
{"text":"First let me say the ppl were nice and the sevice was cool but I was thoroughly disappointed with the \"killer shrimp\". The menu made it seem as if they had a great recipe for their shrimp dishes but to me the shrimp sauce came out a bit oily and lacked flavor. The blue cheese mash potatoes were outstanding but other then that the \"killer shrimp\" we had was just a let down and over priced. I'll go for happy hour specials but not for for the shrimp. 4 star sevice with 2 star food."}
{"text":"Killer Shrimp is a great add to Town Square. While this location has had many incarnations, I hope this one is here to stay. 

The Killer Mac n Cheese is to die for.  Super rich and very large portion.  Good for sharing or could be a meal.

The Killer Shrimp was very good.  Nice flavor in the broth and just a hint of heat.  I had mine with rice and honestly, it doesn't need a side.  The bread for dipping is ample and a perfect match. 

I tried the Westside, gin based martini, it was delicious and refreshing.

I can't wait to go back to sample more of the great food."}
{"text":"We waited 10 min before asking the nearest worker, ended up being a busser, about the menu and then he got us waters. Then found a server for us. There were under 15 people in the big restaurant , staff could improve on attentive ness. Waitress came over and was very helpful. Lobster Mac and cheese and fish tacos were yummy, definitely awesome food! And decent happy hour"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here because we found a deal on Groupon and decided to give it a chance. We started with the oysters, calamari and wedge salad, all of which were excellent. For our main course, we both had the \"Killer Shrimp,\" I got mine with pasta, but we had mixed reviews. While I really enjoyed my dish, my wife felt it was \"missing something.\" My guess is it wasn't spicy enough for her. Anyway, the one thing we absolutely agreed upon was that our server, Kaiya, was wonderful. She was very friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, and overall a pleasant surprise to our evening. Keep it up Kaiya!! Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour

I had a Groupon, so it was time to check it out.  

Chicken Tacos - could have been a tad more flavorful.
Sweet Potato Pecan Pie - Perfect!  The whip cream scoop was as large as the pie slice!
Happy Hour Red Wine - wasn't bad, but I would order something else given the opportunity.
I tried the Calamari from a friend's order. The breading was light and flavored nicely.

My bill was just short of $20, so I didn't use my Groupon.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Spicy...... 7 out of 10 spicyness, maybe....
Pasta and shrimp 9 of 10 spicy, rice and shrimp 7 of 10.   Large portions, great taste, great drinks.  Service was a little slow, but later at night.  Loved the food all the way, desert off the hook."}
{"text":"Minimal wait for table on a busy Saturday nite. Decent food but you need to know there will be a wait for food delivery. Also appetizer brought out mere seconds prior to the entrees. Ordered signature shrimp with rice x2 (2 ppl). One bowl semi spicy with 12 shrimp while the other was very spicy, tons of rosemary twigs & 16 shrimp so not consistent. Coconut shrimp dinner only had 5 shrimp. Overall enjoyed the meal, staff very polite, food delivery timing & meal consistency needs to be addressed. We'll give them another try & hopefully up the stars"}
{"text":"Went to Killer shrimp last night and unfortunately wasn't very killer. Ordered the salmon filet and it arrived it was tasteless. I couldn't taste any seasoning and the sweet potato purée was absolutely disgusting. I asked the waitress to order something else since the salmon was definitely not good. Ordered the chicken tacos those arrived with a whole onion chopped on three little tacos. Took the onions off and just ate it since my group waited 30 minutes for me to get my replacement meal. Nobody in our group was
Impressed so we defiantly won't be coming back. Don't order the shrimp dishes. You basically get spicy shrimp soup. So gross"}
{"text":"Shortly after Killer Shrimp opened at Town Square, Las Vegas, four of us went to check it out--enticed by a Groupon.  At that time, the food was good, but the service needed a good deal of tweaking.  Kathy, the manager, was well aware of her restaurant's deficits and offered us cards for several free appetizers in hopes of our return.  Tonight, return we did, and we were pleasantly surprised that the service had improved.  Some additional tweaking may still be needed, but our overall impression is that Kathy is working hard to remedy any problems in this fledgling eatery.  She was sincerely interested that we were having a positive dining experience and eager to do whatever she could to ensure that.  When I mentioned that I thought four scallops were fewer than I expected for $22, she returned with additional scallops.  Other than the scallops \"shortage,\" the food at Killer Shrimp is plentiful and really very good, especially the lobster mac 'n cheese and the signature Killer Shrimp dishes.  We will go back -- with or without a Groupon!"}
{"text":"I thought I liked it here, even though the service is perpetually mediocre. 

However, tonight I realized that I'm over it. We're here every Monday (they have a special every Monday night). I ordered the same thing as always: 1/2 dozen oysters, peel and eat shrimp, add a lobster tail, and killer corn (I get it, I'm a big eater). 

The first thing we noticed were the oysters, literally half the size of last week. Next my lobster tail was also noticeably smaller, but here's the killer....  

The killer corn (which typically love) was completely different. I mentioned it to the food runner she brushed it off. I took a bite and decided that it tastes terrible. 

When our server came by, I said I didn't like it and it was wrong. She took it back to the kitchen. Later we found out that they decided to use a different cheese, but seriously, if it's good just leave it alone. 

What annoyed me the most is: the manager stops by our table every week, but tonight she didn't bother. I guess she only wants to talk to people when there's nothing wrong. 

On a lighter note, this was the only server we've had that was good."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo delicious! I ordered the \"original jack\" and the broth was the most flavorable broth I've ever had. It has a little spicy kick to it which I like a lot and loved dunking the bread in it! The shrimp was just right :) wasn't rubbery or undercooked, it was perfect and tasted delicious as well. The staff is very friendly and I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Turning a wrong into a right. Our experience started off a bit frustrated as the air conditioning went out. Luckily it came back 10 minutes later. Then we had a few difficulties ordering but in a very impressive manner, the general manager Alicia stepped up to save the day! Her professionalism and hospitality was above and beyond. She was accommodating and very understanding that we had a large party with kids. I also have to give great credit to Genesis and Cassy! Awesome service and food but even better reaction by the staff to make us happy."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The waitress was good until the end she just walked by and set the bill at the edge of the table. Than walked back by and picked it up. Didn't say thank you... Or is there anything else that we needed or how was everything? Idk what changed towards the end. However the food was excellent we had fish tacos, stew, crab cakes and a few other things.  I'm leaving the review because the manager said that they're having a competition between their waitress' and if you yelped with the waitress name. They have a chance to win a surprise. So good luck Adrianne. Hope your night gets better."}
{"text":"This place gets ONE star ONLY Because Jenesis was a great waitress!  She was kind and actually listened.  So many servers can be superficial/ fake, but she was not.  
As far as the food goes... This was our second time here. We were disappointed the first time but decided to give it a second try.  There's so many ways you can prepare seafood and have it taste delicious.  Unfortunately killer shrimp has no clue.   Seafood should be fresh and tasty , not pre frozen or taste like nothing."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Will be back again. Angela the drinks and service was great. :-)"}
{"text":"Haven't written a review in years, but want to help this good restaurant make it. Outstanding food (lobster Mac and cheese, any of the killer shrimp classics, paella, and more), full bar with beer on tap, free wifi, good kids menu, and more. Convenient location in Town Square - one of very few places worthwhile to eat here. Other reviewers seem to really focus on ticky tack service nuances - lets get back to basics and focus on the food, shall we? Don't hesitate to bring a date, family, or just yourself. Btw, nice happy hour too."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out this place since I saw it before it opened at Town Square. Was a little curious as to what it was going to be about. 

I'm still a bit unclear as to the whole motif but it is pretty much like the name gives away an American seafood spot. 

We started with raw oysters, which were quite fresh. Its served with a horseradish cream sauce which was new to me. We had asked for regular horseradish but was informed they don't have it. 

They have a signature dish shrimp in a spicy broth that's cooked for hours to ensure all the spices are mixed well together and have a real kick. Our server explained how a few customera before us said it was a 10 as far as spice so of course loving spicy anything..  I had to try it. Thw killer shrimp is served a few different ways (with rice, pasta, just the shrimp, with crab, etc) I got the killer shrimp with pasta. The shrimps were pretty large and I got to be honest the broth was pretty good, not a 10 on spice in my opinion more like a 7. If you don't like spicy foods, I would caution you to maybe stay away. Which in a way makes me wonder why have a signature dish that not everyone can eat, since not everyone likes spicy. 

The broth is served with French bread for dipping which is a nice touch since there is a lot of broth that shouldn't go to waste. The pasta part of the meal unfortunately was a disappointment. It was very bland and honestly flavorless, definitely just a carb filler. 

Definitely recommend the clam chowder. It really is one of the best chowders I've ever tasted and I am a lover of clam chowder soup. 

As for service, our initial impression wasn't very good. I was a bit reluctant because a few of the reviews I had read did say how bad the service was. They have a host stand outside but nobody was there. We waited a few minutes before walking inside and asking a busser who was walking by if we are suppose to seat ourselves. He said no and found someone to seat us. Not sure the point of the host stand. As for our server after a little bit we realized she was th only one on the floor. We did feel bad for her because she was running from table to table, inside and outside. Granted it wasn't super busy but when we counted there were 11 tables she was serving (all with 3 or more people). It was a weekday but it was also 7:30pm so you would think they would have more servers on. Who knows maybe it was an off night but for being alone, she did pretty good. 

Overall it was ok :/"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their popcorn shrimp today!!! Not bad at all...Caesar salad was great...Yes!! Definitely coming back for my next visit to Vegas"}
{"text":"The Seafood Paella is excellent ! The shrimp roll, shrimp chowder and Shrimp Caesars salad were likewise ! Excellent ! Reasonable price ! Will be back there for more ! Location is excellent ! Service is excellent ! 5* !"}
{"text":"Never a disappointment! I've been a patron of Killer Shrimp since the early 90's, when they were only in Los Angeles. So glad to finally have one here in Las Vegas. Food was just as stellar as it is in California and our server, Mika, was awesome. I love introducing new friends to the OG Killer Shrimp. We had a great lunch and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie each of my visits were because I was drawn in by the female staff working. And I guess I was little curious about the food too. Sure.

I've only been here during lunch. It's a spacious nicely decorated place with a huge bar right dab in the middle. It looks fully loaded so if I find more info about their drink specials and what not you'll be informed.

The food from what I've tried wasn't that great. On the 1st visit I had the Killer Shrimp Roll with some sweet potato fries for $12. The Killer Shrimp Roll was peppers, onions, aoili, and shrimp in a small French bread. I threw in a cup of clam chowder for $5. All together the $17 got me a real basic and not so filling meal than again I do usually eat a lot so maybe it might be filling for some. Honestly I wasnt wowed and I figured if I ordered something with their name in it it would be outstanding. It was far from that.

The 2nd visit I think I had the fish and chips. Honestly I dont remember it to much other than it being not that great also. Maybe that's why I haven't been back since.

I might give them another shot, maybe for their happy hours or dinner cause the rest of the food pics look good. Or maybe I just need some drinks in me first before eating. The rest of the menu looks appealing.

I did hear kids eat free on Tuesday nights. So that's cool for those looking to feed their kids.

Overall I just can't give them anything higher than 2 star at least not right now. Maybe in the future."}
{"text":"I really hate giving this place one star after I had rated it 4 before. But geezuz! After last night, what a huge disappointment! It was my friend's birthday and I recommended this place to his girlfriend for her to throw the surprise party dinner. WAITING FOR A CHECK FOR MORE THAN A HALF AN HOUR IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!! Especially because we were waiting for them to add GRATUITY to our check! We are regulars and have always taken good care of our waitresses to have to wait to have \"gratuity\" added to our check just because we were part of a large party. It sucks how we had to wait 20 minutes for our first beers...unbelievable. Never have waited that long for 2 beers at your restaurant whether it's busy or not. The only evenings we go are Fridays and Saturdays and I presume those are your busiest evenings...? 
To say the least, I'm very disappointed. And our food! Omg. We have never had a shrimp and lobster bowl only come with FOUR shrimp! Really?!?!? And that seafood salad. Blah. Soggy calamari and old frozen shrimp. Wow, just wow. And our first bowl was the wrong bowl so we had to wait for ours to be \"remade\".... She couldn't just leave that one there? Only difference was it had crab. Wow. You guys prob just don't have the staff or experience to cater to larger parties. Just a huge embarrassment and disappointment. Thanks for the unsigned free drink cards. A lot of people in the party said they were never going to return and gave us their \"free drink\" cards. So sad."}
{"text":"Was waiting for this place to open for a long time and was eager to try out this killer shrimp .. Only to be very disappointed .. 
My wife and I ordered the shelled shrimp w bread , fried calamari and belly pork and clams.
The shrimp was basically a 1/2lb of flavorless over cooked hard shrimp with bread so dry and stale that you had no choice to dip in broth witch was very spicy and no flavor .. The calamari was saturated in oil didn't even attempt to eat it ..
The clams where ok , still not sure if I like it or hate it .. I guess I'll know if I run to the bathroom in 30 minutes .. I'm giving 2 stars only cause The service was good the manager and server did apologized and offered a free appetizer to make up for it ,  unfortunately we won't be back .. They totally killed it , literally killed all desires to go back .. Now we are at another spot getting a bite to eat to get this nasty taste out of our mouth .."}
{"text":"We just went to Killer Shrimp today. The food was great. We had the poke as an appetizer and it was so yummy.  They gave such a generous portion for the price.  I had the Fisherman stew spicy and it was fantastic.  Its finally nice to go to a place that really makes spicy stuff to your liking. Hubby had the killer shrimp and it was so tasty....of course I had to try it. Our server Twyla was a great young lady and so pleasant.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went back for a second time.  We have been eating at the Killer Shrimp in Los Angeles for years so this is a comparison between the two.

It was sad to see how empty it was on a Wednesday night at 6pm, then again it made the service very attentive.  

While the broth for the shrimp seems fine, the actual shrimp seemed overcooked and a little tough.  I know the bread is not why you come here but the bread in LV is bland and the crust has no real crust to it.  Why is it so tough to find good bread in LV?  The bread in the marina del rey location so much better.

I really still recommend this place, the meal is good and unique.  I just hope they can find better bread."}
{"text":"Service was GREAT 

Food was bomb, loved the Killer Shrimp Mac N Cheese . All the Killer Shrimp combos are good just a little spicy"}
{"text":"The only thing killed at this place was my excitement and interest in ever going back again. The Hostess was nice as well as the bartender but the food was average or less with no attempt to be anything killer."}
{"text":"The restaurant was dead at 5:00, we figured it was because it was new. We ordered beers and service was fine.  For an appetizer we ordered the Aquachile. The lime taste burned our mouths!  It was basically chopped up Shrimp and lime juice, and not fresh lime, the heavily concentrated lime juice from a bottle. It was inedible. I tried adding salt, and beer, couldn't eat it. 
So we asked for our check, the manager came out, because they noticed something was wrong, and offered us a free appetizer. Frankly, seafood is not hard to mess up, keep it simple, the freshness of good seafood is enough. 
Unfortunately we won't be back for our free app, what we experienced was enough to know we won't be coming back. Too bad, I love seafood."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. We ordered the killer shrimp and fisherman's stew and both were really fresh and perfectly seasoned. Everything seemed reasonably priced as well. The service was great. There was an error with one of our orders and the server and manager quickly took care of the problem and comped us a free dessert for our troubles. We had the huge cookie with ice cream on top and it topped off an excellent meal. The only weird thing was that when you walk in there wasn't a host stand, and the host had the menus, silverware, etc. on a table near the door. It looked a little unprofessional/sloppy to be honest, but it was a minor thing that wasn't enough to take away from the experience. I will definitely be back and highly recommend this place for anyone having a seafood/Creole craving."}
{"text":"After visiting the location in Marina Del Ray, I was excited to learn they were opening one in Town Square in Vegas.  The first indication something was wrong was there was no hostess at the desk in the front of the restaurant and it was quite slow for being prime dinner time (7:30ish). 

We proceeded to walk into the restaurant and asked the first person if we should seat ourselves. She said there was a short wait to be sat in the dining room or we were free to dine at the bar with immediate assistance.  We proceeded to the empty bar. 

We waited, waited, and waited for someone to even say hello - be right with you - anything to let us know we were seen. I could maybe understand if there was no one behind the bar and everyone was busy, but the bartender literally looked at us both multiple times and failed to say a word... At an empty bar!!  After waiting ten minutes and being deliberately ignored by the bartender, we decided to leave and have dinner at Brio.  Funny thing is the manager said goodbye to us on the way out... How could she be so blind.

This location doesn't have the cool, hip, welcoming atmosphere the Marina Del Rey location has - it will probably go down with the many other concepts that have tried that location in the past. No matter how good the food will ever be (which we didn't get to even try) it will never make up for rude, unattentive service."}
{"text":"This is a new spot located inside of Town Square Mall across from the movie theaters. We've been here numerous times and always enjoy the food. But this time we came in during happy hour and was greeted with multiple items at half off. Our server Kareem was amazing, quick and always attentive. The fold was fresh, flavorful with nice presentation as always. Thanks again and we can wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes, but it was just ok. We ordered the killer shrimp and paella. The paella was quite good, but I have no idea what all the hype is about the killer shrimp. The broth is spicy, but missing a layer of flavor. It's a pretty two dimensional flavor profile. Oh well. It was worth it with a groupon. Will try again another time and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Great place! Not so busy right now; but don't let that detour you. Service has room for improvement, but the food is excellent, Mac and cheese is good, had a southern-comfort feel to it, portion is generous for two, I had the paella which was EXCELLENT, a lot of flavor and had my pallet feeling all sorts of goodness, husband had fish & chips which was a little too spicy for him but if you like spicy like me then you'll have no regrets, also had a glass of the Russian Valley white wine, crisp light and flavorful to pair with it all. I'll be coming back, for sure."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed. No hostess. Walked in and asked if we should seat ourselves. Everyone seemed disorganized. 

Once seated, it took quite a while for the waitress to greet us. There were a total of 4 tables (including ours).... Drinks were slow. Glasses stayed empty. 

Waitress seemed distracted 

Food:

Calamari: served with ranch. Who does that?!?
-breading was falling off, NO SALT. 
-when asked for horseradish sauce the waitress brought tarter sauce 
-we were advised the chef was making some fresh for us but we never saw it

Lobster Mac & Cheese **over priced**
 -don't get me wrong, I'm a cheese lover, but it was sooooooooo cheesy that I just couldn't eat it without wanting to vomit

Clam Chowder mediocre 

KIDS MENU ANGUS SLIDERS:
I WOULDN'T EVEN FEED THAT GARBAGE TO MY DOG!!!! 
-over cooked, dry, awful taste. 
-where did that meat even come from? The freezer of 2006?!?!?"}
{"text":"Went there this past weekend for my bro in law's birthday. Came in, no hostess. Glad they came before us and already got a table because I did not want to be waiting outside on that rainy Saturday. Came in and sat, waited for about 10 minutes to order anything. The place wasn't even packed. Staff is standing around talking. So I walked to the bar to order our drinks. While the bartender was making my drink, the waitress finally showed up. If she came a minute later, I would've ordered water from the bar too. Placed our order, food was quick due to the fact there was only 5 tables on a Saturday night. I have to admit, it was pretty good but the Killer Shrimp was pretty bland. Could not find salt on the table. In conclusion, most likely to NOT return. 1 star for service. 3 stars for food."}
{"text":"OMG good clam chowder, the food here is delicious. Best known for their Killer Shrimp, served with French bread to sop up all the juices. Definitely has a kick, even if you have a cold you would enjoy the taste it's that spicy. Lots to choose from. We loved the Asian wings, moist and flavorful. Great environment for a girls or guys night out, sports fans etc. Happy hour has lots to choose from 7 days a week 3-6pm. Lobster Mac and cheese is sinful good."}
{"text":"Most other killer shrimps I've been to have been great, but sad to say that this one missed the mark. The food was ok, service was very slow on an empty night and the drinks were very watered down. So sad to have this happen here."}
{"text":"Had dinner here back in June.  Had the shrimp, crab,and lobster dish.  The broth was spicy and delish!!  The bread to dip in the sauce was a nice addition.  I'm going again in September and will try the crab cakes and original spicy shrimp bowl then."}
{"text":"We were in a group of 7 for Happy Hour on a Sunday.  The place was basically empty.  Service was not really that prompt.  We ordered from the Happy Hour Menu as well as the regular menu.  I shared Shrimp Tacos and Fried Calamari with a friend. The others ordered dishes such as Killer Shrimp, Steamed Mussels, Clam Chowder, Chicken Tenders, etc.
My friend and I concurred that the Calamari was too greasy, but that the Shrimp Tacos were good.  None of the others raved about their orders, some said so-so. Someone thought the menu was amazing.  Too bad we can't eat the menu."}
{"text":"Me and my best friend decided to do lunch here it was her choice 

Mmmmm were both foodies and I will say I was disappointed 

My salad was so light it looked sad NO dark greens on the whole plate at all 

We got the seafood platter which was enough for us to share least the oysters were yummy that's my favorite part 

We both got there signature dish.... I guess there known for it but it wasn't worth it to us the shrimp tasted frozen hard to believe they were fresh 

Least the drinks were good but we won't be going back"}
{"text":"Start with the high notes. Service was excellent. Cassandra was attentive and efficient. Ask for her! Atmosphere was average. Lighting made the menus difficult to read. The seating is not crowded, tables & booths are spaced well. The cocktails are typically priced. I had the Shrimp Killa (Pina colada with nutmeg). It was alright, average. $10. The crab cakes were great. Not greasy, needed a bit of salt, a little spicy. The habanero sauce served with them was hot but not overwhelming. The lobster mac N cheese was bursting with chopped lobster. Not too cheesy (ai like cheesy Mac n cheese) but well balanced. Again, needed some salt. Finally, the shrimp & crab boil. Heavy on the thyme & Rosemary but good flavor. Needed salt ( seems to be a theme!). The lobster was WAY over cooked (stuck to the shell!) the corn was a little tough as well. Might return to try other dishes but not a destination."}
{"text":"I love the name and heard the commercials so I was expecting some killer shrimp. My daughter ordered the Lobster mac and cheese which was good and I ordered the peel & eat shrimp app and a warm spinach salad. Spinach salad was great, tasty and fresh.
The shrimp were not. The sauce was tasty but the shrimp had no snap to them and most of them were mushy. Even over their sauce, you could smell bleach. Bleach!? The staff seemed nice but the place was not busy and they never seemed to come back to the table. For a place that claims to have killer shrimp, they did not. I won't go back and from the lack of customers they had in the place, there are others like me."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was excited to see one of my favourite restaurants come to Las Vegas.  I love the Marina Del Ray location so I had high hopes.  This is not a place you go when you want gourmet fancy this, fancy that or even highly creative anything. This is the place you come when you want hot steamy delicious goodness in a bowl that never lets you down.....until you have it in Vegas. I gave three stars because of its roots and hopefully the promise of it growing into the very large shoes it has to fill. 
In order to do that, some changes will need to be made in the service area. I don't know our servers name (and I should, right?) as she wasn't around much to check on us, fill our drinks, see how things were, if I might have liked a spoon....I never got. (This is a bowl of broth...no spoons came for us) She further ruined our experience with the food by being a horrible server in an almost empty establishment. I served for years through college and after. I know she was bad. I even got up to wonder around to find myself some salt. I needed salt because the broth was just bad. I was so disappointed. The shrimp, and I don't even know how this could happen, had no flavor. None. Neither did the pasta I ordered in it. Also, the shrimp were over cooked and shriveled up and rubbery. The bread was not good but not such a terrible thing since I didn't want to soak up the broth anyway. The bread in Marina Del Ray is soooo good.  But the broth was not up to par with the mother store. It was just spicy with oregano floating in it and no real flavor. I wanted it to be good so bad. It was not. I realize they have only been open five weeks, as the manager (?) kept repeating. I think she was the manager, she never said. But listen, are the first weeks not very important? Should you even open if you aren't ready? What about putting your best foot forward? No excuses. Just do it. She adjusted our bill by 25%.  Oh, we also ordered calamari. It has potential but was loaded with oil, like the fryer wasn't hot enough.  Most people don't know what to expect. If I was a newbie, I'd NEVER go back. But, I'm a faithful fan.....I will go back.....in a few months (to give them time to get it right) if they make it that long."}
{"text":"What a let down, doubt this will last long. Parking in relation to the place sucked. Place at 6:30 was almost empty midweek which is bad because the the center was crowded. 
So service wasn't the best, and I think that the manager really makes the waitress nervous and that didn't help.  Toward the end I was watching as our server was cleaning and wipeing down walls and who knows what. Really! Your manager makes their food servers do cleaning work during their shift as they are serving food, wow, where is the health department on this one.
So food was pretty bland, we really looked forward to this meal, but for what I had the broth that the shrimp was is was okay but the shrimp was just bland with no taste. You would think that with a name like Killer Shrimp that it would be just that. It was like here is some spicy sauce now lets dump some bland shrimp into it.

So needless to say all hopes crushed on this one, and we won't be back unless we hear or read of some major improvements..."}
{"text":"Got the killer shrimp \"shelled\" and it didn't really have any flavor. Dipping the bread in the broth was the tastiest thing. I expected a little more especially for the price. I expected at least for the food to be decent, but it was more subpar. Service was good, ambiance was nice. But I don't really recommend it here. If you want shrimp, go to boiling crab or hot n juicy!!"}
{"text":"I would be surprised if they were open or year from now. Their service has been consistently for the last five visits which is why I chose to not review them until now horrible horrible horrible and inconsistent. Most of the waiters or waitresses don't even know all the menu options, have not even tried the menu options, they don't even claim to know whether they can sub for certain items are not, and out of five visits every other visit has been inconsistent when I have asked them to sub certain items on the menu. It reallyit really is based on who you get and how lazy they really are. The manager is nice and friendly but they seems to be more attentive to operations and bartending duties when no one's in the restaurant and there's only one table, which happens to be mine. Out of the five visits Ive had that manager has either been fiddling with register stuff- taking the bartender or waitress away from the one table I'm at each time or fiddling with the AC. I seriously tried to give this place a chance which is why I made five visits hoping to forgive all the other times and seek some kind of redemption I just my visits but it is consistently horrible horrible service wonderful food and is in desperate need of new management."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this.  I was looking for a place to celebrate my grandson's 21st birthday and saw a Groupon for Killer Shrimp.  I decided that it sounded like a good place for seafood.  This is more than a good place.......I can honestly say this place had KILLER food and I mean this in every sense of tasty, soul flavors, spicy, zesty and just all and all fantastic flavor.  Our server, Tina was polite, answered all of our questions, made suggestions and her service was pristine.  I give her a 10 + for taking care of our needs and even bringing out a dessert with a candle to celebrate my grandson's special day.  We started the evening with Popcorn Shrimp appetizer along with the most incredible Spinach/Artichoke/Crab dip that I have ever tasted in my life.  Our entrees consisted of two orders of Killer Shrimp, while my grandson ordered the Angus Beef Sliders as well as the Fried Shrimp Dinner that came with long crisp french fries and homemade coleslaw.  For dessert we somehow managed to fit in a delicious Apple Cobbler, Chocolate Bread Pudding with Bourbon Sauce and a Hot Fudge Sundae.  The restaurant manager came to our table and check to make sure everything was good and tasty.  I just couldn't stop complimenting her on the fine service from Tina as well as the tasty food and large portions.  Like I told Kathy when we left, \"I'll definitely be back\" and that I will!!!  If you LOVE seafood as much as I do, you must put this place on your \"TO DO\" list."}
{"text":"Poor service. No hostess to take our table. When we went inside bartender and waitresses saw us, didnt acknowlege us and didn't ask hostess to come help us get a table."}
{"text":"Went on Groupon deal  passed by during my visit to Town Square and finally checked it out...customer service  great. our server Kaiya very helpful and explained the menu and style of their signature \"killer shrimp stew\" more like a broth with shrimp added. It is spicy !!! be careful ! they can't adjust the \"heat\" of their stew but can adjust on the other items. I had clam chowder  tasty, homemade, lots of clams  Tried the scallops!! 5 pieces medium size and it was cooked perfectly with light sauce @ mash potatoes $22. I added lobster tail for extra $10. Presentation needs improvement. it looked boring not eye appealing. also the bread they served is plain cold French bread. blah  we asked if they would toast it...they did and it helped for dipping into stew. I suggest they brush a little garlic butter and toast them would make a world of difference !!! I hope they change that"}
{"text":"So, kinda a foodie love going out to eat with friends and family. Went out with my friend we ordered Lobster Mac and cheese, fish tacos,  shrimp tacos,  and spiced fries, along with cocktails.  

Okay, let's start with our cocktails my friend ordered the Sugar Plum Cocktail took a look at her face and took a sip of mine Shrimp Killer watered down tasteless both drinks. 

Then comes the food Baja Fish Tacos it was a bed of cabbage with tortilla and fried battered fish tasteless no flavor. We moved on to the fries definitely spicy but ok. Then the Lobster Mac and cheese watery, tasteless,  shrimp tacos never made it out so we told her to keep it. Ordered new drinks never made it out so then cancelled order asked for manager and never bothered to come out. Not worth it. So had to give it a start since they will not allow me to post unless I give them at a least 1 star."}
{"text":"The crab cakes were amazing, and you get 5 of them in an order as appetizer! They were full of delicious crab meat and not a lot of fillers, and had a nice hint of spice and good flavor, without being too spicy. Nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, just the way I like them. The sauce that came with them was pretty nondescript but I found that they didn't really need any sauce...just a squeeze of lemon, and they were great!

The lobster mac and cheese was delicious, as well! It was soooo rich and creamy and cheesy with lots of lobster meat! 

The warm spinach salad was tasty, and they did not skimp on the ingredients...plenty of mushrooms and bacon...and the dressing was tasty, but there was way too much dressing on it, for our tastes. I would order it again, but ask them to go easy on the dressing next time. It was a good size salad...perfect for sharing before dinner!

The only thing we were not impressed with at all was the killer shrimp with French bread. It was just meh. The broth is very watery and, although it had a slight spicy kick to it, it lacked any depth or outstanding flavor. It just tasted like shrimp broth with spice. My husband loves his bread, but we both agreed this bread was nothing special.

The staff, however, was wonderful! They were very attentive, helpful, and friendly. We were greeted by the manager within minutes of sitting down at our table, brought water right away, without even having to ask first, and we were checked on quite frequently. 

We will probably return for the crab cakes, and to try some other entrees...just won't be going back for the \"killer\" shrimp!"}
{"text":"We love Killer Shrimp!!!! We went here before catching XMen Apocalypse. Chelsea made our visit smooth and fun. We aren't originally from Vegas so it was good to meet someone that we can relate to. The manager was nice as well (I can't remember her name thought  sorry) but Chelsea should definitely win the contest you guy have going on. SHE DESERVES IT!!!"}
{"text":"I have been scoping this place out for a while.  I finally decided to give it a try. What a let down.  You would think with a name like Killer Shrimp that they would have an emphasis on shrimp and seafood.  To start with the menu was very disappointing.  They had 1 shrimp dish in each category.  No creative shrimp dishes or variations on shrimp like you would expect in a place that has shrimp in it's name.  We had the peel and eat shrimp and steamed mussels as an appetizer.  The shrimp was seasoned nicely but it is obvious that there is no love in this kitchen.  The shells were split on the back of the shrimp indicating frozen shrimp that have the vein removed when packaged.  The shell adhered to the shrimp and it was not an enjoyable experience trying to peel and eat the shrimp.  The steamed clams were good and the broth was tasty.  My shrimp po boy was okay, nothing special and my friend had the shrimp salad which basically looked like a salad with shrimp on top. He was not impressed either.  For a place in a trendy location with a catchy name it is too bad that the menu does not support the hoopla and they do not deliver what is promised, or at least suggested."}
{"text":"We went to Killer Shrimp because we had a Groupon.  we walked in and we greeted promptly by our waitress, \"Mika\"  She asked us right away what we would like to drink and brought it in seconds.  She was very sweet and nice.  It was very refreshing to be treated with such kindness.  We noticed the \"Happy Hour\" menu that is M-F and will be back to try the goodies on that menu.  While waiting for my husband the manager advised me that on Monday's they have 1998 prices and mentioned the signature dish is $9.99.  We will be back to see what else is on that menu too."}
{"text":"Waitress and hostess super nice and accommodating. We were given sangria with black wilted mint garnish and my cloth napkin looked like someone's snot was on it :( coconut shrimp was tasty."}
{"text":"The prices are too high for the meal you get. Service was sketchy. Waitress messed up the whole order and took her time bringing out the correct meal. Allowing people to light up their e-cigarette inside the restaurant is unacceptable! Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food was great but the place was so hot that we could not enjoy it. Just ruined the whole experience. They said that yaaa these tables in the back get really hot. Well don't sit people there then."}
{"text":"First, I will say this is the second time we have come here.  The first time was not as good as we hoped.  But, I can see that they took some of our advice on the reviews (Unless we were just there on an off day last time).
    We did not repeat the same order, because some of the items we got before we just would not trust making the same mistake again, but this time we tried some new things and were very happy.  
   The first thing we did have again, which is simple is the kids Chicken Fingers, and our review last time was that they were under seasoned and just tasted bland... this time, excellent.  They were right on.
    My wife tried the Appetizer Spicy chicken Fingers, and they were awesome!!   Like a really flavorful boneless buffalo wing, but I think even better.

   I had the BBQ fish sandwich, and it was really great.   Fresh Avacado, Tomato, Lump Crab, Grilled Fish on a bun.  I was pleasantly surprised.

My older Kids shared the Coconut shrimp and loved them, and for the younger kids we did the chicken Fingers and split the appetiser popcorn shrimp and they loved both.   Popcorn Shrimp was a good size portion.

   The server and Manager were again top notch, very helpful and friendly, and I believe the owner even stopped over to say hi, which always feels like they care. 
     We were pleasantly surprised at this follow-up visit, and would now go back for sure.  

The ONLY complaint I would have is, we walked past the empty server desk and stood inside for about 2-3 minutes with no sign of a greeter, server or hostess.  We almost seated ourselves, but waited a bit longer and someone finally came out.  This is simple to resolve, so I imagine as they get more fine tuned they will resolve this.

Kudos for great service!"}
{"text":"Both my wife and I had the Killer Shrimp, Crab, and Lobster in their spicy broth. You get about a 5-6 oz lobster tail split down the middle, 6 snow crab claws, a couple of small pieces of sweet corn, and about 8 good sized shrimp. But the star is the broth. Good amount of spice and tons of flavor. We were told it's a closely guarded secret. They give you lots of French bread pieces to soak it all up. Service was good also so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I went to killer shrimp.  The last time I went was in Los Angeles many many years ago.  We came in the early afternoon and the restaurant was 10% occupied.  Basically slow.   I had the killer shrimp with bread and rice.  Bread was ok at best.  Almost wonder bread like which is not good.  Shrimp was ok.  Rice wasn't well prepared, and seemed old.   Service wasn't as fast as you'd expect with the restaurant sparsely occupied.  Don't think I would return"}
{"text":"This place is fine. Really just mediocre. There was no hostess, so we just awkwardly walked into the middle of the virtually empty restaurant until the bar tender noticed us. Then some big guy at the bar, possibly the owner, turned around and just kinda waved us in without saying anything. Finally, the bar tender seated us. I had the killer shrimp with crab and lobster. The broth is decent, but the lobster was so hard to get out of its shell that I was worried when it finally came loose my arm would fly back and knock everyone's drinks off the table. The biggest let down was the bread. I was really looking forward to sopping up that broth with some nice crusty bread. What I got instead, was about as substantial as wonder bread. Good luck trying to sop up the broth with bread that turns instantly into liquid."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience at Killer Shrimp tonight. It literally took an HOUR AND A HALF from the time we sat down till the time we finally got and paid our check. The only things were got were chicken tacos, an order of sliders, and fries. And believe me, it burned to actually give them money. 

As mentioned above, the service is painfully slow. Nice wait staff, and plenty of them, but there were only 5 tables including ours, and they spent most of the time happily chatting with each other, as opposed to actually waiting on their tables. It took so long to get our food, I was about to ask if it was even coming. I thought the waitress had forgotten.

3 Tiny Chicken Tacos: dry, tough, overcooked, and unseasoned chicken, on a soft shell taco. Topped with a bit of onion and cilantro. It came with a green taco sauce that sadly also lacked flavor. Edible, but pushing it. $7

Beef Sliders: I keep telling my boyfriend that the word slider in Vegas mostly translates to overpriced, crappy mini burgers. He never listens. These definitely fall in the overpriced, crappy mini burgers category. Unseasoned ground beef slapped onto a mini bun, some cheap, flavorless cheese on top. Again, edible, but very disappointing to my male. $7

Killer Spicy Fries or whatever: These were actually really good, and a huge portion too. Great seasoning, a little spice, nice and crispy. Unfortunately, the lazy waitstaff were too busy talking to each other to bring these out. They were cold when we finally got them. The fries were the best part about our meal, but they would have been awesome if they were actually hot, or even warm. 

It took about 20 minutes to get our check, since our waitress was too busy chatting with a coworker.. Again.. That was just the icing on the crap cake. 

If you must go here, you should probably get what they are best known for, and skip the failure of a happy hour. It's held every day of the week, even on Saturday and Sunday, which would be great if the service and food didn't suck. 

The Killer Shrimp with bread dish looked REALLY good, but I doubt I'll be back to try it, based on the awful service alone. The other restaurants were packed, while Killer  Shrimp had only a few tables filled. Hopefully management catches the hint.

Update: I'm not sure what it was, but I've felt absolutely ill since I've eaten there. I only ate 3 chicken soft tacos and some fries, but I feel awful."}
{"text":"This time around the service was better and my salad wasn't warm. (see first visit review).  This time around.My husband tried to order 2 different beers and they were listed on the menu but out of them. Not off to a good start.  The shrimp cocktail my friend and I both ordered, came with 3 medium sized shrimp hanging over the martini glass and chopped up shrimp with salsa.  Too hot for both of us.  The bottom plate included overly fried wonton-ish chips.  It was okay.  My husband got coconut shrimp and fries, he said half were good and the others were chewy. They looked really dark and overcooked to me.  Our other friend had the shrimp pasta he said it was fine.  Because the service is still a little slow we didn't order dessert since we were trying to see a movie after.  It seems a bit understaffed? Drinks, food or anything extra you ask for takes a long time to come out. It's tough because shrimp is my favorite food.  I order it everywhere I go.  I just am not finding this place to be special or something I want to eat again. This was saturday night and should be seeing people wanting to eat here. It was very bare with several empty seats."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a great shrimp place to come around! Kaya (May of spelled that wrong) was our server. She was awesome, helped us chose based off our liking, very attentive, and super sweet. It's nice and rare to have great customer service now a days. The food was amazing. The scallops and lobster mac n cheese were my top choices. So much flavor and now I'm in a shrimp killer coma!!"}
{"text":"Wow, was very excited to go. Ordered specialty dish, not great. Stick a fork in this place."}
{"text":"This is more of 3.5-4 stars.
We came to Killer Shrimp and had mixed emotions when walking in.
It's a huge open room....hardly any people sitting to eat....a little bit of art work on the walls and music too low for this big space.
We were nicely greeted and promptly sat and ordered drinks.
Unfortunately the bartender isn't that great (sorry but it's true) stick to wine and beer. We had Sugar Plum's .....Westsides.....margaritas....monitors.....Manhattans...we really tried! 
We even debated in leaving but really had our hearts set on trying the shrimp.
For starters we had a beach house salad, grilled Caesar and clam chowder.....grilled Caesar was awesome but chowder was a little bland nothing a little salt and pepper didn't fix!
Entrees.... killer shrimp bowls....paella.... Fishermans stew....steamed clams.
I'm a fan of the killer shrimp peeled bowl...a little too spicy for me but still great. Only suggestion is to bring out grilled bread and not just plain bread. Shrimp were a great size and plentiful.
Kids meals were good too....my kid finished their shrimp and chicken fingers....and the fries are good. Fresh and hand cut!!! 
All in all it was a great meal and we will return.
Please work on those bar skills....but thank goodness for beer and wine."}
{"text":"Killer Shrimp has been a family favorite for the past decade and we are so happy and thankful to have a Las Vegas location -- and the food of course, does not disappoint. It is amazing. However, the staff here is not the greatest and I'm afraid this will deter people from eating here. The hostess who sat us and our food runner / busser were fantastic. Our server however -- not the greatest. Not even good, actually. We saw her maybe only a few times and that was after flagging her down because she forgot our drinks (again). The only smile and friendliness from her came when she dropped off the bill, of course. As someone who works in the industry, it's irritating. As someone who really wants to see this place be successful, it's really irritating. The food and concept are worth the bad staff, though. Try and stick it out and enjoy your meal. Honestly. As far as management goes, I'd take a better look at your servers."}
{"text":"We tried to come here on Monday night, but when we arrived at 10:20pm we were told that they had already closed. The waitress thoroughly apologized and explained that they were on winter hours and that Yelp had not updated their information. She also gave us some coupons for free drinks and an appetizer. We came back on Wednesday night and were very impressed! The prices are extremely reasonable for the amount and quality of the food that they provide.  I had the Fisherman's Stew and it was jam-packed with a variety of seafood! I will definitely be coming back here the next time I am in Vegas. Also, our waitress was extremely accommodating and very kind."}
{"text":"We had several expected trips to Vegas recently and we over dining in the Casinos. I was pleasantly surprised to find Killer Shrimp in LV! Were CA natives and lived in LA for a bit so familiar with the original restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised! Great service and always yummy food and the best part great price!"}
{"text":"So yummy!!  Hurry!! Do not pass GO!
Service Outstanding ....Food Great! Sliders and Chicken Fingers with a Real Coke and a Stout! Such a Nice Addition to Town Square.  Worth the Trip."}
{"text":"I used to live in Marina Del Rey, and at Marina Del Rey was one of my favorite restaurants called Killer Shrimp.  The patio had a great view of the Marina.  Anyways, now that I live in Vegas, I was super excited that this place opened up!

By no means should this be compared to Hot N Juicy or Boiling Crab.  It's a difference style of cooking.  

It's pretty much shrimp in a bowl of spicy goodness with a side of bread to dip.  I went with a spicy level of medium, and it ended up being really spicy!  Shell on shrimp is the best.  The Killer Shrimp bowls are generous portions.    

There's been so many businesses at this specific location of Town Square.  I really hope Killer Shrimp is here to stay."}
{"text":"Love this place been going to the org location for years and Im so over joyed that they opened one up in vegas... Order the org killer shrimp bowl peeled shrimp and mac and cheese... Delish!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's Killer...haha! We ordered a bunch of appetizers...Ousters, pull and peel shrimp and shrimp cocktail was the best I've had! Shrimp Killa cocktail was delicious! Service was amazing and the Manager, Cathy was super sweet! Thanks for an awesome night! We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Groupon and decided to try it. I ordered the shrimp, crab, and lobster and my husband had the shrimp with rice. The broth has a nice kick to it, not too spicy just enough satisfy that craving...I had to request salt and pepper though because the broth was a little bland besides the spicy taste. Overall, the food and service were good!! I would recommend this place if you like seafood."}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for the Los Angeles, California location for a long time now; well I finally got to try it but here in Vegas. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't what I thought it would be either. The restaurant was nice and clean, the server was nice. I ordered the Killer Shrimp Pasta(without spice) and the bar drink was the Shrimp Killa. The pasta was supposed to be garlicky, but it was sooooo NOT. I told the server and she went to the back to see what she could do to fix it, she brought me back some fresh chopped garlic; I took it and mixed it in with my pasta and made it taste better. Problem is I shouldn't have had to be the one making and doctoring up my dish, I kinda expect garlic flavored anything to taste like garlic is in it.... :-/  The drink was ok, pretty strong so I guess worth the $10. I just didn't feel this place was anything special overall, maybe my expectations were too high for this place... Anyway I just visited this place a couple weeks ago and it's closed already, see the short story below, I've copy and pasted from vegas.eater.com: 

Killer Shrimp at Town Square shuttered after less than 11 months operating at the shopping center. The restaurant based in Southern California announced the closing on Facebook.

\"After eleven great months in Las Vegas, we have closed our doors at the Town Square mall. Thanks to our amazing fans, we plan to re-open next year at a better suited location. We are truly grateful to everyone who came out to support us and look forward to keeping our loyal fans updated on our new projects.\"


*I just want to call BS on this lol, this is probably one of the best suited locations for any business, it's a very busy and popular area, I guess it doesn't matter anyway cause I feel like been there done that, not a place I feel compelled to go back to, sorry not sorry  :-("}
{"text":"Came in to check it out this place since hear in about it on radio , place was almost empty beside some not so huge birthday party that was ready to leave , we waited to be served over 15 minutes in this almost empty place before walking out ,if it's up to me this place won't last , very poor service !"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from the radio and convinced a couple of friends to go with me to check it out. The staff was fantastic and knowledgeable about their menu items. I got excited when the drinks and appetizers came out (the soup was delicious) because that set up the entree for a slam dunk. Instead it fell flat on it's face. The killer shrimp was a huge let down. The shrimp itself was an average size but the sauce it comes with was nothing more than spicy water. It's a shame that it's considered the leading item on the menu since it lacks any sort of flavor. I also tried a piece of my friend's fish. It was not what I expected from a seafood restaurant...dry and not much else going for the dish but the fries. I give the place a solid rating of 'meh' and recommend sticking to appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"My wifey and I work in Town Square so a new place to eat is always welcome.  Between us we had the clam chowder, lobster Mac and cheese, pork and clams, and the garlic mashed potatoes. The clam chowder had really nice big clams and the pops of sweet corn added a nice texture but it needed salt and pepper.  The mashed potatoes were really good but cold. The pork and clams was tasty and the basil really cleaned up how heavy everything was. The lobster Mac and cheese was awesome! Would absolutely order it again. It's listed as an app but the portion is huge so can work as an entree easily.  The prices are a little higher than the rest of TS but the portions make up for it.  It's a new place and it seems like the staff is still working out their kinks but everyone was nice."}
{"text":"Our first time there was good but last weekend was awful. Tacos had absolutely no flavor.  We didn't finish them. Table next to us had people loudly complaining. Wont last long at this rate. Owner had better take notice before it's too late."}
{"text":"The shrimp po boy was very good and had a lot of shrimp.  The shrimp was also grilled which i personally liked.  We have had their clam chowder several times and it tastes homemade.  The popcorn shrimp was tasty and had a jalapeño tapenade which I enjoyed.  We specifically asked the bartender to put bread for the soup and extra sauce for the popcorn shrimp.  When we arrived home we found that the bread and extra sauce was forgotten.  I called in and spoke to A very nice and accommodating lady who was the manager.  She was empathetic with us and made everything right for us.  She said she would speak to the back of the house employees so this doesn't happen to anyone else.  We like this place and will definitely be back.  The manager was top notch."}
{"text":"To me, the food tasted good. I had the scallops with mashed potatoes, some shrimp, and crab claws. A few hours later though? I got super nauseous & had an upset stomach for the rest of the night. Then around 4am it ALL came out via the oral route. I don't normally leave low reviews & feel bad but something I had here definitely did not sit well no matter how much I initially enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!!!! Must try the clam chowder!!!!! Mika was a great waitress!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it was not too crowded so I have zero complaints about the service.  Our waiter was informative and friendly.  The food did not blow me away.  I ordered the clam chowder, a generous portion for $7, I like my chowder thick and creamy and this fit the bill.  For my entree I went with the Killer Shrimp over rice shelled since that is what they are known for. It had a good amount of shrimp and I like spicy food but for me it was just all spice and too much of it.  I took home my leftovers and enjoyed them for lunch on Monday which makes me think once the flavor settles it taste better.  I may go back to try their happy hour as I did enjoy my Mai Tai."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, had the classic killer shrimp and the taste for this dish was perfect. Baja shrimp tacos and fried coconut shrimp were also excellent.  Make sure to ask questions about the menu if don't understand, I wonder if some of the negative reviews thought this was a simple shrimp seafood place."}
{"text":"I recently had an amazing birthday dinner at Killer Shrimp!  We were a large party, and we all needed separate checks, which were granted.  The food was excellent and service outstanding.  I wouldn't hesitate to have another event there, but it's a diverse restaurant that would be great for a shopping break or post-movie dinner as well.  On a side note, the menu contains non-seafood options as well."}
{"text":"This place barely deserves a star.  It was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. 
1. We had no specific waiter, multiple people coming to the table, but nobody had a clue what they were doing
2. They refused to make me a non-alcoholic cocktail (I'm pregnant)
3. Took 20 minutes to bring my husband a drink
4. Another 20 minutes for the food runner brought our appetizer, and gave us no silverware, my husband had to take it from another table. 
5. Another 20 minutes for the most disgusting and inedible food to arrive.  I ordered roasted chicken and it was the greasiest most disgusting mess I had ever seen.  I sent it back after 1 bite.  The entire plate was a pool of oil. 
6. All the while, people who arrived after us got their food before us and some had even finished and left in the time this took."}
{"text":"Never disappointed by this LA native...and glad they made it across the desert to Sin City! Food is outstanding -- you won't be disappointed by any of the original Killer Shrimp dishes [yes, it's spicy...and yes, the rice and pasta dishes are just there for filler...if you want \"actual\" pasta, our server suggested ordering the Garlic Shrimp & Clam Pasta and add Killer Spice to it!], or the Lobster Mac n' Cheese, or the Paella!"}
{"text":"Came here today and left before ever ordering. 

The gentleman and I literally walked into an empty restaurant. So empty we wondered if they were open at all. Staff members stood around , others sat at the bar conversing. We were properly greeted at the door , assured they were in fact open and shown to our seat. The hostess was pleasant enough.  She even informed us of the happy hour specials. Cool start. 

But then...

Can I just tell you that NO ONE came to the table. No one. Did I mention the restaurant was empty? Because it was. There were literally about ten staff members standing around, and then, us, lone patrons in the building. 

So as my gentleman got up to use the restroom, sure someone would be by before he came back. He suggested I order a couple things. But no one ever came. Lol. It was quite comical. He came back and made a big fuss (it was really just a small fuss) about us not even receiving water. To which we heard bickering about who was in charge of our table and even a question of where another server was (apparently on lunch) but yes finally a server came over. She said she would bring us waters. 

Simple enough right ?!

But they never came either. We just ended up leaving and dining elsewhere. And I really wanted to try the killer shrimp too. Shame."}
{"text":"Everything (killer shrimp, paella, lobster mac and cheese, crabcakes) was delicious! It's too bad, however, that the amount of \"killer\" heat can't be adjusted. It was a bit too hot for a couple of those in my party. Service was outstanding, too. Will surely return. Kids eat free on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"this company doesn't even deserve 1 star. My son has been an employee of this company since day 1 of opening here in Las Vegas, the have bounced his pay check not once but 5 times in a 10 month period. The gas has been turned off due to non payment, beer and alcohol deliveries have been delayed due to non payment and they are consistently not paying their vendors. while the food may not taste bad the company has poor ownership and poor management. please don't support a restaurant that dont take care of their employees these young men and women work hard and are disrespected  when the owners think more of themselves than to pay their employees."}
{"text":"It might be me, but when you order from the lunch menu and they charge you full price it can be overlooked.  But,  when you tell me you don't give back change only dollar bills is annoying!  If it were clearly stated on the menu or my receipt,  I'll a bilge,  if you point that out when I clearly tell you it's my first time there, I can choose to continue with my order. But to be told oh that's just something we do is bad for business, so the change you kept made it very easy to leave as a tip! Which was way less than I had originally considered given. Nevertheless,  the clam chowder tasted like it can out of a can, clams were gritty and not appealing at all! Maybe they should just stick to shrimp,  and I'll be contacting the better business bureau on the practices of keeping patrons change!"}
{"text":"My first impression was not very good. The service was less than adequate, especially when the restaurant was nearly empty at 5:00 on a Saturday night. We were told it was happy hour, but only one domestic and one imported beer was on special. Of course it was not a beer I wanted so I was stuck paying full price during happy hour. And to top it off they were conveniently out of the draft I wanted, but they did have it in bottles that were more expensive. Obviously they are not clear on the whole \"happy hour\" concept. Maybe they should go across the walk way to Yard House and see what it means.
As far as the food goes, I had the scallops and they were excellent. Unfortunately I was disappointed in the whole experience."}
{"text":"Eat here before and the food was good with good service. Just tried it again but this time service was garbage. The gentleman at the door couldn't seat us outside cuz he didn't know there weren't anymore tables available. The when we did get a table the serve came with a bad attitude letting us know she was suppose to be behind the bar. The they told us that due to leap year today being the 29th of Feb it was all day happy hour. Then they changed their mind with a big attitude. We left after that and went to Yard House."}
{"text":"First of all, I am so happy there is finally a place like this that my husband can get his shrimp and seafood fix and I can have plenty of options other than chicken fingers (I'm looking at you Hot n Juicy.)
Everything we had was awesome. We definitely over ordered, but that's something we tend to do when trying a new spot. 
You could tell the food was all fresh. Clam chowder was on point and made me miss being back home in the Bay Area. The tuna poke was delicious! (It's VERY hard to get me to like something like that!)
The service was prompt and friendly, even when it started to get busy. The manager even spoke to us twice! Something I find very rare these days is to have a higher-up check on tables without making it seem like they're obligated to do so. She was friendly and genuinely inquiring about our experience. Even the food runner was friendly and GENUINELY willing to get us what we needed!
We will definitely be returning here, especially since most of the things we loved are on happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I went with two of my girlfriends for lunch, one which has been plenty of times in California! We ordered the warm spinach salad, shrimp original, and sweet potato pecan pie. Everything was to perfection. I will be going back in the near future!!!! Mika was our server and she was so pleasant and gave us a wonderful experience!!!! Thanks again Killer Shrimp! You did not disappoint!!!!"}
{"text":"Since the town square opened up I am not sure how many restaurants have been in the location where Killer Shrimp is now but if this particular restaurant does not get its act together this restaurant will be closing its doors just as quick as they opened them. The service was great but if your going to have Lobster Ravioli on your menu and your a new restaurant trying to gain customers you shouldn't be telling customers you are out of it on a FRIDAY night here in Vegas.I ordered the Killer Shrimp in a bowl with Rice and after 4 bites my mouth was on fire and I was sweating so if your not into spicy food this dish would not be for you. I ordered the lobster ravioli and I tasted quite a bit of onions and I showed the server and tried telling me there is no onions in there but I showed her a white small piece that was and all she could say was it can't be onion.I can't say I am impressed with this place as it needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"Staff was great and our server Missy was very attentive so five stars on that level. As for the signature dish, meh. As another reviewer said don't compare it to Hot and Juicy. Different style but having said the it's shrimp that didn't really absorb the flavor of the broth which is just ok. I asked for cream and garlic which kicked it up.  I would opt for a place like Smokin' Hot or Hot and Juicy. Or for that matter, anyplace that knows how to do a true New Orleans bbq shrimp dish."}
{"text":"The host sat us right away. However every staff member that was working during this shift Ignored us until I finally said something after 10 minutes. There's a happy hour menu so I ordered a small plate of calamari. Warning: it's super spicy and it they don't mention it. 

They also forgot my silverware. Maybe the server was just having a bad day....I wouldn't come back here"}
{"text":"I went on Mother's Day and used a $50 Groupon. My mom and I had:
- Fisherman's Stew 4/5
- Killer Shrimp, Crab, and Lobster soup 3.5/5

Service was good and bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"I am sad that this place is closed. They had EXCELLENT customer service and food when I visited. (August 2016). I am late in writing this review and it's too bad they did not last."}
{"text":"So I don't know much about Cajun cuisine but I'm inclined to like this place. It's unique to Vegas fare and its flavors are absolutely fresh and robust. We tried the killer Mac and cheese, steamed mussels, BBQ Mahi Mahi sandwich with regular fries, the grilled Caesar salad and the Killer Shrimp. My son son devoured the sandwich but I think they could have done better with the fries, my husband liked the salad but having it grilled was a little weird, the killer shrimp is a must try and I can see why it's kept them in business for 25 years, and the mussels and Mac and cheese were spot on."}
{"text":"First time here, had no clue how this place is gonna turn out 
The location is pretty good, right off the AMC at Town Square across Yard House.
For me the welcome is important, and this one did not miss the mark. We choose to sit a the bar, good decision. The bartender cum server was awesome, when she realized we were first timers she immediately bought us up to speed with the history of the place and their signatures dishes. 
ON her recommendation we choose their signature dish - the Killer Shrimp original - a spicy shrimp stew with half lbs of shrimps. It does not look great, but right from the first bite we could not stop. Its awesome, kind of stew you would expect in Thai restaurant - spicy n addictive. 
During our meal, the manager Alisha stop by to check on us. It was another education on the concept and Alisha recommended the dessert. Potato Pecan Pie. A knock out dessert. 
This place, knows its food - great service - I strongly recommend this spot 
We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Monday is $10 for their original shrimp bowl that comes with plenty of shrimp and broth you can dip bread into( usually $17). I work near by and I can tell you this is a must on Mondays. The rest of the menu is very good but Little pricey colored to other places in the mall. You can't beat this deal on Mondays though and the calamari a favorite!"}
{"text":"Step 1: walk up to menu, looks decent 
Step 2: restaurant doesn't seem busy
Step 3: approach podium, older lady at the front states there is a 30 minute wait time. 
Step 4: look inside there is at least 6-8 open tables
Step 5: walk away and never return

Plenty of other restaurants in town square that actually fill their tables.  This joint will be closed in 6 months like every other restaurant that occupied that space. Bad service kills businesses."}
{"text":"It's literally been decades since I've been at the Killer Shrimp in Marina del Rey California. Located south of the Yard House and East of the Panda in restaurant is where you'll find this is establishment.

They have a huge outdoor patio that wraps around the business since it's a corner unit. Inside you'll find a bar and dining room which is quite spacious. I started off with the spinach salad which contain the hard boiled eggs bacon and yummy. I followed with the fisherman's seafood entree which is a seafood stew that contained an assortment of seafood and was garnish with two pieces of toasted bread which was perfect for dipping into the sauce along with all the seafood. The portions are decent here and the prices are fair - everything was tasty and flavorful.

If you like spicier flare go for the original killer shrimp wh i has a Cajun kick and  yummy too!"}
{"text":"The peeled original shrimp, lobster mac, and grilled cesar salad are my absolute favorites!!! There weren't many people dinning when I came so it didn't look that appealing but don't let that stop you! The food is so yummy and the staff is great! Our waitress Cassandra was so sweet, upbeat and helpful. The busboy and manager Kathy were also really nice : ) : )"}
{"text":"Best food ever. The calamari was TO DIE FOR. The signature shrimp was amazing - spicy and flavorful paired with super sweet corn and perfectly cooked lobster. The bread was a perfect compliment and wonderfully soft. The Pieces Of Eight drink is highly recommended. Thanks to our server Tina for the fantastic dining experience!"}
{"text":"I moved from L.A. and had heard about Killer Shrimp, but couldn't get myself to drive in traffic for 40 mins, hunt down parking, then wait for a table. Killer Shrimp had a booth at my jobs Christmas party and the shrimp skewers were great. They hooked me (get it) with a free drink pass if I came in to try it out.

As I walked up, I didn't know if they were open because it was lifeless inside. I open the door and the cool vibe of a lounge surrounded me. The music is high enough to know the song, but low enough that you don't have to yell over it. We came in at happy hour (side note: Happy Hour is 7 days a week!), we went to order clam chowder (great), shrimp and fish tacos (reminds of San Diego style tacos), fried calamari (decent) off the HH menu. I ordered the Jumbo Fried Shrimp plate. It was underwhelming when compared to the HH items. 

I'll go back for sure, even if I have to battle the tourist at Town Square for parking."}
{"text":"Service was actually great here; food, unimpressive. Although the hostess told us, on a rainy and slow night, that we would still need to wait 15 minutes for a 2-top, we sat at the bar and were granted a table, waited on by the friendly bartender, because she disagreed with the hostess. Not sure if that caused problems in their rotations but we thought it was nice. Bartender was an attentive and helpful server. 

Food, on the other hand, wasn't impressive. As first timers, we opted for the stars of the menu and got the killer shrimp and lobster as well as lobster Mac. I added a side of garlic mash to go with the soupy bowl. Everything lacked salt, BIG TIME. The shrimp bowl was not \"killer.\" It was definitely seasoned, but not correctly. There was recognizable dried thyme floating around and you tasted that but nothing else really. I was not impressed by what should have been the best thing on the menu and, for over $20, was really lacking shrimp quantity. The lobster Mac, again, little flavor but brimming with tail meat and gooey cheese; a plus, kind of. There was more lobster in that than there was in the lobster & killer shrimp bowl we ordered! The garlic mash was not garlicky at all. The potatoes were very light in texture, a bit over-processed, and hopefully not instant. Would NOT order again. The winner of the meal was the sweet potato pecan pie, hands down. 

I would visit Killer Shrimp again, but not order what I did and probably not give their famous killer shrimp a second chance. Upsetting...."}
{"text":"This place has some serious issues. The service is terrible and while the food is good I don't like hearing the business issues while eating.
Such as the payroll check for the staff are always bouncing vendors are not paid. 
The personal drama as well \"baby daddy\" and I'll cut that ****h.....I felt like I was in the middle of some ghetto soap opera...
No thanks..."}
{"text":"Yum! I walked in with a friend and my 2 kids after a long day of walking at comic con. I spend a lot of time in Town square, but it was my first time at this restaurant. I am a seafood fan so I was excited to try a few dishes. I had the seafood salad, which did not have fake crab. Delicious. I also ordered the peel and shrimp plate, mac and cheese and rice for the kids. The mac and cheese was served too hot, had too much cheese and had a huge helping. I appreciate that it was kid friendly. My son fell in love with our server and actually jumped into her arms. Instead of being mortified she received it well and kept coming back to talk to him. He felt like a STAR! This is why I give this place 5 stars. Service is a lot of why I go back to places. Now hopefully my son won't jump on her next time and just give her a nice hug, but he already said he wanted to go back. I am so sad I forgot her name though. Tami? Terri? Something like that? We will be back!"}
{"text":"I tried the Killer Shrimp,  the signature dish, and it was just ok.  The broth has a lot of heat, but no flavor.  My husband had the Fisherman Stew,  which was much better, it actually had flavor! I gave them 2 stars instead of 3 because the restroom was filthy.  Probably won't go back since there are better options at Town Square."}
{"text":"Ok food,  but not great. Everything is spicy so if someone can't eat spicy go elsewhere. Prices were average."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. We tried the raw oysters, fish tacos, clam chowder, and their specialty shrimp with the bread and white rice. Our server said the shrimp spice level was a 6 but it wasn't spicy at all to me. It was probably a 3. But it was good. That portion is big and I shared it with my friend. Oysters were fresh and yummy. Although I thought it was weird how they only serve 3-6 for happy hour. I love oysters. The way they served it on ice was perfect. Their clam chowder was a little too chunky for me I like it to be more smooth but it was still tasty. Our server was great but I had to ask for a plate from the buser and he gave me a dirty one without realizing it. Maybe the cleanliness can be worked on but food was great. Their drinks selection was a little limited to my taste but you guys should try their version of the pina colada comes in a cool glass :-)"}
{"text":"Meh. Hubby and I went for late lunch early dinner. We shared the fish taco app. They were good, but needed lots of hot sauce, otherwise they were bland. 
My husband had fish and chips which was very good. I had a bowl of killer shrimp and I honestly didn't get the hype. Most of the shrimp were not deveined, but my biggest issue was the sauce. You're supposed to dip bread in this wonderful sauce. It was sour and had an overwhelming amount of Rosemary. So I ate a few shrimp and hubby ate the rest."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We ordered the killer shrimp and the lobster mac n cheese. The flavors are amazing. The killer shrimp was on the perfect spicy side! However, not too spicy, I don't typically like spicy foods. The lobster mac n cheese is a MUST! Perfect location, great vibes, and great service!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't great, stools at bar so uncomfortable. Asked to move to booth or table so we can comfortably have some drinks after dinner and was told I don't think so, let me check, and after waiting for a long time because it seemed like such a hassle, we decided to go somewhere else for drinks.  And the place was pretty empty!! Don't waste your hard earned money. This location has seen many restaurants come and go so can't wait to see what will be there next because it's bad and was empty on a Saturday at dinner time!"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous...killer shrimp and rice had the right amount spice and lots of garlic.
The pork chop and blue cheese mashed potatoes was seasoned to perfection!

Our waitress Genesis had phenomenal customer service.she was very pleasant and extremely sweet.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Crab cakes and amazing..however the service is ok for it being a busy place at all..lobster ravioli was amazing as well. At little over priced!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, great music, awesome customer service and of course: great food!! The 'Killer Shrimp' their signature dish is really a must have. Spicy and flavorful, it comes with bread to soak up the broth. 
The customer service is really top notch our bartender was the best! We will be back."}
{"text":"the place was empty and they had a ridiculous 45 min wait.   This must be a different owner then Marina Del Rey because we always had good experience there.  Maybe they franchised and have bad management now.  The food was still good but total experience was bad.  Bathrooms were disgusting both toilets overflowing and horrible stench.  They have a prime location and definitely could have been packed if they had the staff for it.  I would have thought this was just a one-time fluke that they were understaffed but it happened to us twice the same week.  Also happened to our friends as well.  Not sure who is running the show over there but they certainly are not doing a good job."}
{"text":"awesome food and great customer service! Cassandra was very friendly and polite. definitely going back here"}
{"text":"Killer service from our server Cassandra! The manager was also nice and accommodating too.  As for the food and drink....KILLER! We will definitely be back.  We like it as much as the other Killer restaurants in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm never disappointed. I order the shell on killer shrimp and great drinks.  Happy Hour is really good too"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Killer Shrimp when it was only Shrimp and Bread on the menu. I was always there on laurel canyon in California and the one in Vegas is just as awesome with a TON of more items. I'm definitely coming back! Food was great and so was our service"}
{"text":"Got a groupon for this place and when I showed up it was closed for mechanical issues. Not cool!! I came in from Los Angeles for a girls trip to Vegas and was looking forward to eating here."}
{"text":"1st off I need to talk about the shrimp cocktail..so freaking good, never tasted anything like it!!!! Ok now I can start my review;),  located at town square close to movie theater, very nice atmosphere, very clean and very nice service everything was very good. If I could I would give KILLER SHRIMP 10STARS- KILLER SHRIMP IS THE BOMB.COM."}
{"text":"Hate leaving bad reviews but the service and food quality was mediocre at best. I would have given a third star but we were literally one of two families in the whole restaurant. There should have been no reason to wait 20minutes for a check or a water refill with 5 servers standing around."}
{"text":"Came here because yardhouse was packed. Since they call it killer shrimp, I was thinking the brought would be so good but it was average. Toasted bread would've been better and served on a plate instead of a that thing they used. A thicker broth would've been nice too instead of the once they serve. I just got full from the bread. They were nice to comp us for the late calamari. Our server took a good while to come back with my credit card, I don't know why. Calamari was average too. The broth has potential, needs more tweaking. I might come back again."}
{"text":"I love shrimp, so when I was in Vegas looking for a place to eat (off the strip), this place came to mind...maybe it was because they were advertising 24/7 on the radio!  The food was good, but I wouldn't say I was blown away.  Overall we had a great time.  Service was slow when we got there, but our server/waitress did take care of us.  I would like to try it again (if I was ever back in Vegas), so I can try their signature \"Killer Shrimp\".  I was not in the mood for a brothy meal that day.  Its located in a big outdoor mall/plaza/shopping center, and it could be hard to find.  I called them so I knew where I was going, but there was literally no way I would have known had I didn't."}
{"text":"The servers were very polite and timely, but I was very disappointed by the food I don't think the shrimp had nearly enough flavor on them and they were just floating in a giant bowl of juice with noodles. We also had the sweet potato pecan pie which was highly recommended by our waitress but seemed to be either frozen/store bought/or made a week prior."}
{"text":"\"The Original\" was the first dish EVER that made me want to make special trips to any food place as often as i could.  That was over 20 years ago and to either of the original 2 spots in Los Angeles.  I was heart broken when they closed and beyond happy when it reopened.  However, no matter what they say,  the recipe is not the same.  It's been tweaked and not necessarily for the better.  Now is good enough for me to remember how good it used to be but not good enough, hence only 4 stars. The Original is a bowl of tasty, somewhat spicy broth you eat by dunking slices of French bread. A the broth level goes down,  a pound of shrimp is slowly revealed.  The Original coves with shell on shrimp.  There is an option to have it with the shuttle previously shelled, as well as having either rice or pasta adeed into the broth as well. I only recommend The Original,  but mostly because it's an experience too peel the shrimp with your fingers. Wash your hands twice,  use the bibb,  ask for extra napkins and get to pinching tails and...well,  you know how is said shrimp are best eaten. The clam chowder is good to,  but i can't vouch for any of the other dishes on the menu.  I'd like to have them some day but that will never happen because for me,  there's only 1 reason to come here. The Original."}
{"text":"had the killer shrimp with rice and it is simply delicious"}
{"text":"Food was good.. But the whole \"half off\" in Monday's is a bit of a stretch.  It's really only on the original.  Lobster and crab are exclude and there are up charges on the rest.  Just seems dishonest the way it's presented when you sit down..."}
{"text":"Such a great experience and good food. We had the fish tacos, calamari, chicken tacos, and killer shrimp with lobster. Cathy the manager was helpful and cassandra was an amazing server. Very friendly, honest, and fun. Will be back :-)"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting and looking for something different for dinner. We were sat immediately. The hostess answered some questions for us about the menu. Our server came over right away. We loved her. She was bubbly and attentive and made many suggestions. Another server acknowledged us as well and said someone would be right with us. We started with calamari which was good. We ordered the Killer Shrimp with rice and the Killer Shrimp with pasta. We loved the broth. Dipping the bread in it was very yummy. Our bowls both came with ample shrimp. I couldn't even finish all of mine. We will definitely visit again when we are back in town."}
{"text":"So I have mixed opinions about this place.  The sauce and shrimp are great.  French bread isn't really french bread.  Soaks the sauce up good though.  fried shrimp said large or colossal or something and were not big at all.   Also, I think the server lied to me about the desserts being made in house.  Anyway, go there for the killer shrimp if youj like a little spice."}
{"text":"Service - Our server was very friendly and attentive. She made sure we liked our food and top out drinks when its low. She also conversed with us and gave us tips on what to get.

We ordered the following:

Fried calamari - the breading is too much. It wasnt that good plus it came out after our entree. Our server comped it though (without us asking) so that was really nice of her. 

Fisherman's Stew - the broth is very spicy but it had a lot of seafood on it. I wished it wasnt too spicy for me so I could have finished it. 

Braised Short Rib - my hubby loved it. It was delicious he said. The meat is very tender too. 

New York Cheesecake - delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here on my birthday (6/16/16) for the first time and was so pleased! The entire staff was supper helpful with the fact it was my friend and I's first time there and took the time to explain the menu to us. Genesis was a complete sweetheart making sure to answer all of our questions and recommend drinks and food to us. 

Both my friend and I got the Shrimp bowl with rice, I got a side of veggies and he got a side of mashed potatoes. We got a huge bowl of bread for the table to soak up the broth the Shrimp comes in... SOOO GOOD! It's a little spicy, Genesis was definitely right when she rated it a 6/7 out of 10! I just wish they could modify that a little so more people could eat it, but still amazing. 

Then on top of it all I was offered a free, full size dessert for my birthday, complete with candles and everything.. I ordered the Apple Crisp/ Apply Cobler (I forget) but either way- It was soon delicious!! 

I recommend this restaurant to anyone, Thanks for making my time here for my birthday so amazing Genesis!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  
The menu could be more descriptive & pictures of the meals on the menu would be helpful. 
The food was okay.  
Out of the meals we had, the fish was the best.
I would not recommend this restaurant. There are a lot of better places to eat at in Vegas then this place."}
{"text":"You don't have to worry about service at this place.   Service is excellent.  The food is just how I remember it in California.   Happy hour items could be better though.   It's definitely worth the try but you have to (it's  a must) order the killer shrimp.  I ordered it with rice on the side.   Oh, and the steamed clams with broth was delicious."}
{"text":"Halloween dinner, say the advertisement on FB and decided to try it out. My bf ordered the Killer Shrimp with noodles. His only complaint was that he wished the killer shrimp sauce was a bit thicker since they give you bread to dip. The bread is not toasted so it kind of soaks up the sauce. To me it was to soggy I nice dipped. Either thicker sauce or toast bread. The flavor was OK. And had a good amnt of shrimp so that was a plus..  Not mind blowing however my killer Mac n cheese was soo yummy!! Like super yummy! It was not spicy at all and had pieces of shrimp throughout. I want some now. The calamari was excellent. Cooked perfectly! Also the fried shrimp good. You gotta try the Mac n cheese and calamari can't go wrong.

Service was a but slow but uta opening weekend so it's all good."}
{"text":"Your message has apparently been received. Visited tonight and our service was very good. We had clam chowder, popcorn shrimp, peeled shrimp bowl and a warm spinach salad. All of the food was excellent.
If you like shrimp, I would recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in Town Square, one of my favorite Vegas shopping destinations.  That's a plus, especially since there is usually lots of parking to go around.  The Killer Shrimp entree provides 1/2 of a pound of shrimp in a luscious dipping sauce.  French bread with the sauce is good but not really to-die-for.  The service was way, way too slow for the level of business.  Had to hunt for someone to get the check since our waitress had disappeared for 15+ minutes.  So for some good, spicy shrimp with French bread for dipping at a reasonable price, it's a decent value.  If you're in a rush, you might well be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered the signature dish killer shrimp with pasta....mediocre at best the pasta seemed like an after thought in the dish the only plus was the bread that came with the dish to sop up the spicy broth.  Service was below average took forever to get the check and closed out I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Delicious and spicy.  EVERYTHING was spicy, luckily our party of 4 likes heat.  The crab cake appetizer was hot, but full of flavor.  Our table ordered the lobster mac n cheese, paella, and the shrimp and rice. All of it was pretty tasty and satisfying."}
{"text":"Been going to Killa Shrimp for years and years. It's a Well known restaurant in LA. When I heard there was one here in Vegas I was excited. GREAT food. Unique dishes. Great service. Cassandra was our server multiple times and she kicked ass."}
{"text":"Restaurants have come and go in this particular location in Townsquare way too many times. I really hope Killer Shrimp is here to stay!  

Items tried:
- Killer shrimp
- Clam chowder
- Calamari

Our server was super nice and helpful. She recommended the killer shrimp, their signature dish, since it was our first time there. When the dish came out, it wasn't much to gawk over, but my tastebuds thought otherwise. The broth was so good! Loved the spice and the herbs. Dipping the bread in the broth was the best part. So addicting! Save time and avoid smelly fingers. Order your Killer Shrimp \"shelled\" for a peeled version. 

During happy hour the clam chowder is $5.  I can be a clam chowder snob, since I grew up in the bay area. There's nothing better than clam chowder in SF or Monterey at the pier. Not really comparable, but Killer Shrimp makes a really good version! I love the chunkiness of the chowder with all the clams, potatoes, and veggies. Save some bread to dip in your chowder too! 

The calamari ($6 HH) was easily forgettable. If in Townsquare, I prefer Brio or Fleming's calamari."}
{"text":"Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin art adorns the walls. I like the rocky vibe they're channeling. A dozen oysters and a 312 beer on tap made for a happy evening. Finding Goose Island beers in Las Vegas is not easy. This Chicago native knows.

I took my lunch mate and he tried the calamari and a Shrimp Killa which is a girly pina colada...girlier than usual but alright in my book with a sprinkling of nutmeg on top for good measure. The calamari was lightly fried and enough to share.

The bartenders are cute, flirty and friendly. Try it out before they become slammed with tourists."}
{"text":"My wife and i ate there today and had the crab fries. Cup of clam chowder. And seafood salad.  Seafood salad had lots of seafood on it with a great zesty thousand island dressing.  The crab fries were piled high with cheese and crab meat. Clam chowder was super creamy and excellent.  Great ambience inside.  Excellent customer service.  We can't wait to go back and try more stuff. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were here yesterday and the host sat us outside and told us that a server will come by to get our orders. My wife and son went to the bathroom and came back the server still MIA. We waited 5 more mins and left. I told the host that there's no people inside the restaurant and there's no server to check if we wanted to order. They don't want the business we bring that's why we walk out. To the owner of this place check your employee. You losing money because of them."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in Town Square. The service was awesome, attentive and friendly.  The food was delicious. I highly recommend the lobster mac n cheese, it was to die for, but know it is huge. The killer shrimp is spicy but not mouth on fire spicy. The sweet potato fries didn't have much in the way of seasoning but the spicy fries were very spicy!  Overall, great place"}
{"text":"So many of Town Square's eateries are awash in tired stereotypes. Not Killer Shrimp!
Upon being seated you're promptly greeted by a server. Look the drink menu over, try one or two;)  May I suggest the Sugar Plum or The Westside! Take a bite of one of Killer Shrimp's creations....seafood salad, 'peel & eat' shrimp, Asian pork drum sticks and finish it off with Killer Shrimp's S'mores! 
A punch of flavor and taste is a serious understatement.  The dishes are delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicolious.. wonderful staff..  if you haven't tried it you need to.. great shrimp bowl and spicy sauce."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night but still wasn't that crowded. However, once we ordered a mixed drink and a glass of wine, it took 15 minutes before Ebony came to tell us they were out of the wine we ordered, so we got a lemonade instead. Then, after 10 more minutes we got the mixed drink that came in a martini glass..half full...for $10. Still didn't have the lemonade, because she told the table next to us they were waiting for glasses to be washed and they had ran out. By the time the lemonade was delivered I had finished my half full martini and ordered 2 Belgian white beers (might as well order 2 since it takes so long), to which Ebony asked \"do you mean the Shock Top or hefeweizen?\". (I said the Belgian white because that's exactly what it was called on the menu), but I responded hefeweizen. Instead I was brought 2 shock top...15 minutes later. We asked if we could move outside because even though it was just the two of us, we were sat at a table that was 6 inches from another couples table and felt like we were practically on top of the strangers they sat next to us. When we finally got our food- it was somewhat good, which is why they're getting 2 stars. However, the portions were ridiculously small for the prices they charged. 4 scallops for $22? Our meal was obviously quick once we received our food, and we won't be back. $95 before tip (which I only did out of good conscious and not out of performance by our server) was rediculous."}
{"text":"The calamari and habanero tartar sauce is amazing . Fried shrimp very good , sweet . I got the peeled killer shrimp in a bowl served with French bread . Good, the broth is a little spicy for me , that's why the serve it with a lot of French bread I think . Laura , our server,  is so attentive and helpful , ask for her ! The bread pudding is yummy , and hot fudge sundae is huge , with a separate gravy boat of real hot fudge ! We'll  definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Came here super excited for my birthday dinner, everyone left kind of disappointed. This restaraunt is located on the back side of town square downstairs across from the movie theater steps, below Blue Martini and McFaddens. When we went in we noticed there weren't too many customers, maybe 2 to 3 tables; I've noticed this spot is bad luck for business owners as no vendor has really stayed very long before leaving. We were seated at different times, as we showed up, once we were all there we ordered our drinks Pieces of Eight, Shrimp Killa, and Sugar Plum. I preferred my Pieces of 8 over the Shrimp Killa but it had decent flavor, none of us were thrilled with the Sugar Plum. We all ordered lobster mac and cheese app, Killer Shrimp Original, Shelled, Pasta, and Shrimp and Lobster, Herbed Chicken Salad, mashed potato side, and baked potato side. All of it looked amazing but was so bland and disappointing except for the Mac and Cheese, it was the best thing but could have used more lobster. It took a very long time to be served and when we were it was 1 or 2 of us at a time. The servers were all extremely nice and apologetic, almost overly apologetic, but obviously disheveled. The owner or floor manager awkwardly came over to make sure we were satisfied, she only spoke when her lurking presence was really awkward. We ate and ordered dessert, the cheesecake was tasty but the cobbler was inedible, it tasted like oil with no sweetness at all. We were comp'd a dessert for my birthday and the cobbler was removed. We have no plans to return, maybe if we hear improvements in other reviews."}
{"text":"I know everyday can't be a good day and that was the case this evening! The calamari was simply amazingly tender! Yet sad to say we were totally disappointed in the lobster shrimp bowl,for the broth was bland as bland could be. Although new businesses deserve a second chance we'll do just that and see if they can redeem themselves!"}
{"text":"I was excited when this restaurant opened in Town Square, I love seafood. Time went by and I saw the ratings were on the low side but I saw a Groupon so I couldn't pass up the chance to try it out for pretty much half the price.
We went on Sunday afternoon and the place was eerily empty, 3 other tables occupied, no hostess present to greet us, so we walked inside, feeling confused...maybe we seat ourselves. We stood for a few minutes until someone came out from the back, apologized, and got us to our table.
I pretty much knew what I was getting, I studied the menu for days. My poor husband doesn't like seafood so he had few options we knew wouldn't be anything to write home about but he would endure for me.
Neither of us got drinks, just beer and water.
I got the Killer Shrimp, Crab and Lobster. It comes with bread for dipping in the sauce. The sauce had a peppery spice, it was good but it overwhelmed the seafood. The seafood was cooked nicely, plenty to eat with a few corn cobs (34$).
My husband got The Filet done medium with mashed, it came with a demi glaze over the steak. It was a small portion, he said it was better than expected but nothing special.
We skipped dessert.
Our waitress was nice and gave us adequate service.
More tables filled as our meal progressed.
So I'm glad I got it out of my system. I got a bowl of clam chowder to go to try later, it was pretty good, probably the only thing I'd go back for.
From what I saw I wouldn't doubt if Killer Shrimp folds in a year."}
{"text":"Really Really GOOD!!! Food, Coffee & Service by Cassandra, mgr even stopped by to make sure all was great!!! I hope this place last the lest 3 or 4 did not!!"}
{"text":"Very nice, Melissa was great, food was good, already making plans  to return next week"}
{"text":"This place is awesome,  I read reviews about bad service and I was confused,  they have excellent customer service,  from the helpful host to our awesome,  and very pretty waitress,  to our efficient bussboy, our waitress even gave us our drinks for free because she said that she had a big table come in and felt bad she didn't get to check on us which was crazy because I thought she was amazing, and attentive.  And the food was delicious,  

We got

Clam chowder 5/5 amazing not too creamy and heavy,  and not too watery,  nice flavor.  Loved the corn in it. 

Lobster Mac and Cheese 5/5 creamy and delicious with generous amount of Lobster. 

Killer Frys 5/5 omg so freaking spicy, my mouth was on fire. 

Calamari 4/5 it was good, crunchy and not oily. 

Peel and eat shrimp 4/5 Again spicy and too much spice for my taste,  but it was still very good.  My husband loved it. 

Killer shrimp bowl with angle hair pasta 5/5 The broth was so good,  it's spicy,  but darn good. The shrimp is Cooked good,  and it's generous in portion.  

Killer shrimp with lobster, crab, and ,corn with angle hair pasta. That was spicy but very good flavor.  All the ingredients blend in well together.  It's delicious with the dipping bread. 

Bread 2/5 lol it was definitely different.  Not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"This place just opened at Town Square. We had come from an early Sunday movie and I was craving clam chowder, so my husband and I thought we'd give this place a try.

No one here, but was taken to the far wall of booths, we'd asked for one. Our server came up to get our drinks, intoduced herself and gave a very brief account of 'their concept'. I heard shrimp, spicy and bread for dipping. We ordered an original killer shrimp bowl, about a dozen decent size shrimp, peel still on, swimming in a big bowl of tasty broth and spices but not much of a kick as far as spice goes. 

The bread for dipping in the tangy broth was freash, soft, not toasted baget loaf sliced into small bits good for dipping, but would be better as toasted and warm, just my opinion.

We ordered my bowl of clam chowder and it came out late, we ordered both shrimp and the chowder at same time but they forgot it. It finally came out once she realized we still hadn't gotten it. It was thick, a lot of clams, bits of carrot, potato, celery and was very good. I used some of the baget to dip it!

We also ordered the steam muscles, clear tomato broth, plenty of them and juicy good, the warm spinach salad, plenty big to share, bits of mushroom, egg, bacon and blue cheese crmble but a bit dry, could have used more of the vinaigrette dressing. And the paella, plenty of mixed seafood, steaming hot and seasoned well. 

They seemed to be over staffed with assistants/ busers and not enough servers, ours was waiting tables all over the place and she didn't make it by often enough to see how we were doing.  She missed our dessert order because she took too long checking in on us!  

We got plenty of tea refills, extra bread, they cleared away the dirty stuff, but waiting over 20 minutes just for her to come back to us after we'd finished our food meant she was too busy to care about our dinning experience. 

Everyone was friendly but I guess things are still so new, they haven't figured it all out."}
{"text":"Different type of hot and Juicy I must say.  The killer shrimp is a killer!! The Lobster Mac and Cheese is a bowl size of food for $14 it's good but just a bowl.  The Seafood Paella is meaty.  The concept of the French bread and killer shrimp (shrimps in a big bowl with hot sauce)  and use the French bread as dipping.  It's all right. Mini crab cake is spicy.  Good spicy food.  The service top notch!! Ebony was our server she was sweet. They weren't busy on a Friday night so it was easy to get a table.  Convenient location.  Right by the movie theatre in town square.  I don't know if we want to come back and try other dishes or not though.  
We shall see!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour and to use our Groupon. 
Can't go wrong with this place.  Delicious food and awesome service from our waiter, Cassandra.
Don't miss the clam chowder, calamari and the Killer Shrimp with Lobster special. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Thx Elizabeth ur the best! Yout service was immpeckable!!The coke with spice was the baum! I got the pan roasted  chicken highly dissapinted... It was very moist but blan the asparagus was to charred and very blan blan blan.  I will come back for the bar only NO FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to go to this place, and then the let down.  It took about ten minutes of us looking at every waitress passing by until someone finally came over and asked us if we had been helped.  Went downhill from there. Bad service, disappointing food, and music so load you cant talk to each other."}
{"text":"Service is okay. But their signature item, killer shrimp is just a meh at its best. Decent portion but its was very bland (i ordered the spicy one). My friends said they have a pretty decent menu, but their signature dish is to be avoided. Will not return."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I mean how can you go wrong with shrimp.  And to be honest, there is nothing wrong with the food. It just simply doesn't impress.  I enjoyed my meal of crabcakes and paella but the paella was lacking in flavor.  The crabcakes were good, but very thin, almost like a potato pancake with Crab.  The crab taste was faint, but noticeable and it was my favorite part of the menu.  The price point is on the high end and I was grateful I had a groupon to make my $50.00 tab a more comfortable $30.00. (I did have a Jameson on the rocks to bring the tab to an even $50.)  At $30.00 it was an acceptable meal. However, at full price, there are many better options."}
{"text":"This review in no way reflects on the service or the staff which were very friendly and attentive. Since this place is known for the \"Killer Shrimp\" I decided to give it a go. I ordered the one peeled with a side of angel hair pasta. I have to say, the shrimp were large and plentiful. The sauce..... which we were told was spicy, really wasn't that special or particularly  spicy. The side of \"angel hair\" pasta was really just plain old spaghetti. The French bread served with it to soak up the sauce was boring store bought(Albertsons?)  and not even toasted or crusty. It was a disappointing lunch overall."}
{"text":"Must try. Monday is OG Pricing as they say, the original menu item of the shrimp is only $10 compared to the regular price of $17. It is served with fresh French bread. Will be back every Monday it was that good!

Simply put, you must try this place,"}
{"text":"This place is doomed... I'm almost embarrassed for them.

I'll get the 2 positives out of the way... the staff was friendly and I like the overall atmosphere of the place.

Unfortunately the negative list is much much longer but I'll try and keep it brief.

First red flag was that the place was totally empty about 4:30 pm.  Just 1 couple at the bar.

Ordered a soda and water and the water itself was probably the worst tasting water I have ever had in my life.  In fairness I've never been to Rio or Flint... but it was really really bad.  This concerned me since this very well could be the water they use for cooking.  

Clam Chowder was more of a corn chowder.  They don't have crackers but offered to bring croutons instead.  But not very good at all.  Little did I know that would be the highlight of our meal.

Ordered fish tacos which had no taste whatsover.  If I didn't know what I ordered... I would have had no clue.  It was pure mush battered and fried with tasteless slaw and sauce.  I didn't even bother eating the second one... and I'm fat and rarely don't finish meals.

Wife ordered killer shrimp which was over priced and the sauce was bland.  Guess we were expecting something with flavor or some kick and it had neither.  Served with some bread which just tasted old... it wasn't hard... just tasted old.... if they bake it there... perhaps the water made it taste funny.  Decided we would try some butter since my daughter wanted bread.  The butter was grainy and sort of had a faintly buttered grits type taste and texture  I don't know how else to describe it... I mean there is no reason that I should be critiquing butter right?  But they gave me no choice b/c it was so odd and gross.  Also.. the portion size was 1/2 pound of shrimp with shell on for $17 which seems awfully high... especially when sauce was weak.  I believe Hot & Juicy Crawfish is much better and quite a bit less expensive if I recall...

Had calamari which wasn't terrible.... but had some breading issues.  Fell off and no taste.  The dipping sauces weren't very good and the cocktail sauce tasted very cheap and watery.  

Kids meal was chicken fingers and the batter just crumbled off the super dry and overcooked chicken.  (The breading seemed quite different than the calamari but they managed to mess up both)  Fries weren't bad... but even the ketchup taste weird.  I actually joked about trying the ketchup just to see if it tasted wierd too and I was shocked to find that it did in fact taste weird.  

At this point I'm questioning if I am sick where everything tastes funny but unfortunately for Killer Shrimp... I'm as healthy as can be.

Wrapped up our meal and debated on whether to complain or not... but what can u say when everything was bad.  How could they even make it right without just refunding the whole meal knowing there was no chance we would ever come back... so we chalked it up as a loss and moved on.  

Bus boy came to our table as we were just beginning to wrap things up.  Seemed to be urgently trying to clean the table and be in our way as we were finishing our drinks and packing up the 2 kids.  I guess they desperately needed our table since they now had 3 tables occupied so it was necessary to rush us off.  

One last thing that was odd.... the straws for the sodas were literally the same height as the glass.... so that made drinking a little more interesting... luckily I have big lips and could reach the miniature straw.

The menu also doesn't have any pictures... not that this is always a big deal... but I would think that a place like this would benefit by showing a few of their dishes since you don't see places like this everyday and should be easy to make the dishes look appealing in pictures anyways.  Seems very poorly run and won't be surprised when it is gone in 6 months.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My brother wanted to eat here for his birthday. We went on a Saturday evening and it wasn't packed at all. I had never heard of this place, but I would come back again. My sister and I shared their clam chowder, lobster mac and cheese, and their Guinness bread pudding dessert. 

The clam chowder had CHUNKS of clam in every bite. Many places (even those known for they're clam chowder) are sparse with their clam. It was a bit creamier than I've had, but overall, I'd come back for more. The lobster mac, on the other hand, was very cheesy and they used shelled macaroni, but the lobster wasn't as abundant as I would have liked, but the mac itself was delicious. 
The Guinness bread pudding with ice cream was ON POINT. The bread wasn't so sweet, which contrasted so well with the ice cream. I'd come back just for this dessert. They allowed my brother to pick his own dessert and he got it for free for his birthday. He chose the apple cobbler, which was a little too sweet for our tastes.

We were served by Angela, who noticed our bill hit the $50+ mark and so wonderfully notified us of a Groupon that was currently available at this time, so we were able use it for our dinner. I recommend you give them a try!"}
{"text":"Good jazz music to set the outside area be romantic for any couple date night. The dishes are way filling and even good the next day if you can't find the bottom at one sitting. Staff was well aware of our needs and even said good night with a smile.  Thanks Cassandra !!! Will return again."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but I just can't. The service was slow from start to finish. It was after 9pm so they were not overly busy. A table should never have to be sitting with a credit card in hand staring into space for 10 minutes before anyone notices they are ready to leave. The food was mediocre. The coconut shrimp were all breading and soggy. The fried cod was tasteless. The fancy drinks were completely watered down. We left a table full of food and $75 at this place. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here before and enjoyed the restaurant & menu. But tonight's experience was absolutely sad. Put in a to go order for my wife, my cousin, & my self. Called the the number for Las Vegas. Put in a good sized order. Steak, Mashed Potatoes, Crab Stuffed Shrimp, 2 orders of Mini Crab Cakes, Popcorn Shrimp, Baja Shrimp Tacos, and Asparagus. The lady who took my order read it back to me and my cousin while on speaker phone and gave me a $132 or so total. Tells me 30 mins. I make it there in 45 mins. When I walk in there is No order, the confusion the staff showed and the manager showed felt like a bad act. I was fist asked if I called the correct restaurant meaning I called some place that was next to them in town square, then I was asked if I called the Vegas store, which I then told them the number we called, then was asked if I had the name of who I talked too. Who ever gets the name of the person who takes the order. Usually they take your name for the order. But sadly there was zero communication. I called the restaurant like I have in the past. I see all the bad reviews here now and I total get it. Sorry won't be coming back. And now I am going to Crab Corner. Man I drove all the way to town square trying to be a good patron of the establishment only to have some one working there totally forget to put in the order. I am sure I spoke to one of the guilty person involved but in this day and age this is just proof of more laziness and lies."}
{"text":"I have no clue why this place has a single bad review! I suggest trying the place out for yourself. You may have a great experience like myself and my family. But everyone's opinion and experience is different so here's mine! I came in with my family (husband & 2 kids) Genesis was our server, she was very informative & seems to enjoy working here. She had answers to all my questions and made great suggestions. I took her advice and ordered the passion killer, which was amazing might I add! We also ordered calamari to start. It could have been fried a bit more but I'd definitely order it again. My kids ordered Mac&cheese and fried shrimp for dinner and my husband and I ordered the blackened salmon and the killer shrimp. My kids ate every bite, as did we! The salmon was spectacular! I also had a bite of my husbands killer shrimp, it's a little on the spicy side so beware! But very good! I will definitely be back. Service was amazing as well as the food! Good luck to you all at killer shrimp!"}
{"text":"Took the husband here for a date night last night.  Upon arrival, we were greeted, but had to wait an extensive amount of time to be seated as the hostess was stationed outside with her menus and seating chart, while it was about 40 degrees out.  We waited patiently and were seated within about 10 minutes. The only problem with this is that there was no one in front of us!  

We were served our drinks, a house specialty cocktail and a ginger ale.  The ginger ale was terrible, tasted like Sprite and a shot of Coke, and was replaced promptly!  The appetizer of lobster Mac and cheese was phenomenal...absolutely amazing!!  We thoroughly enjoyed the dish and will have it again.  

I ordered the signature dish of killer shrimp and my husband ordered the jumbo crab cake dinner. Upon arrival, my dish was abundant while my husband received 2 small crab cakes.  He made a quick joke about the size of the cakes which prompted a quick response from our server.  She immediately told management, who then sent our server back to let us know that we  would be receiving another meal on the house.  The incident was handled seamlessly and quietly.  We continued to eat our meal and his additional crab cakes showed up within a few minutes. 

Kudos to the staff and management for handling this so quickly.  We are impressed with your customer service and will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"@ killer shrimp for dads bday. Had killer shrimp lobster, shrimp, and crab in spicy broth a side of garlic mash and bread. Can't wait to return.

{"text":"Walked into a VERY clean and cutely decorated place. Sarah greeted us with such an awesome personality/attitude. Great customer service and food was awesome. We got the Passion Margarita and after Sarah's suggestion we also got the Pieces of Eight drink. They were great prices and all had a generous pour. We will definitely be back. Good food, great customer service and great happy hour. Thanks,Sarah!!!"}
{"text":"this place confounded me a bit.  We stopped in during a weeknight, but passed up several other venues which were packed or had a wait.  This place was pretty empty.  maybe 6 tables, with about 4 people at the bar.  This place is a very large space, so it felt strange.

Similar to others, we experienced some weirdness with the wait staff.  it took a bit for someone to come to the table, but once it was sorted out, she was very attentive and personable.  Think it was more of a management thing than anything.

Food was solid, but not over the top.  got the signature killer shrimp dish and it was very tasty.  Bread was a bit dense for my liking, and didn't really have flavor by itself.  Not likely to be back in this area anytime soon, but if someone wanted to go, I would certainly join them.  However, I don't know how they will continue to stay open with such little traffic.  Got to be some expensive real estate."}
{"text":"Came here with the family for dinner. Not a long wait for a table. Our server Elizabeth was great! From the greeting to the end! Elizabeth gave us nothing less than amazing service! I had the killer original it was tasty and just the right spice level! Our appetizers were good too! Shrimp cocktail definitely gotta try! We will be back there's more on the menu I would like to try!"}

{"text":"I came here recently for happy hour. Good choices. I wasn't too hungry so I had their fish tacos off the HH menu. Good portion with all you would expect with fish tacos. 
I used to go to killer shrimp when they had a location in Santa Barbara. Never knew the reason why they closed that location? I'm trying to figure out why there is never a lot of customers? I hope I just pass by at the wrong time of day. Would hate to see a new business fail. Be back soon"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place since most of the boil-in-a-bag places in town are pretty good. After reading the regular and happy hour menus I decided to order the two varieties of tacos on the HH menu and the \"Killer Shrimp\" the namesake dish (peeled) to be split between me and my three friends. The tacos were meh, and the signature dish was horrible. It tasted like it looks in the picture, and with a strong aftertaste of chiles and chlorine. Yes, chlorine. We sent the dish back and they asked us if we wanted them to remake it. Their menu says the sauce has been simmering for an extensive amount of time (like 10 hours or the like) and if it tasted horrible the first time then... We opted for a bowl of the clam chowder instead and that was probably the best thing I put in my mouth. Their HH white wine was actually a Rose' that gave me a headache for two days. I gave them two stars because the server was really nice but the food was not even worthy of one star."}
{"text":"Came here on my last night in Vegas. This place was hard as hell to find. The only people I could ask was those damn people that try to sucker you into buying a timeshare or hey you want some free tickets? And like I tell them. If it cost money or my time it's not for me. Ok let's get to the point of this review. Killer shrimp is a great place. It was somewhat empty and that is crazy because the food is really great. The crab cakes are the best! Sorry no pictures for them, they was in my mouth before I could even get my camera out. Staff was very friendly & was willing to take back the HOT HOT HOT soup I was eating & replace it with someone else, even though I was 1/2 way done eating it. So instead they gave me a big jar of water. This place is a gem in Vegas & I wish them nothing but the best. This place is worth checking out if you're a seafood lover."}
{"text":"I love this place! I was so happy when they opened one in Vegas because I've been to the Marina Del Rey location and loved it. FYI it is spicy so if you don't like spice don't go here or don't get the killer shrimp. I really like the Killer Shrimp with Rice the best. The pasta is okay but much better with rice. It comes with at least 10 large shrimps and amazing slices of bread for dipping. It's about $18 a plate but there's a Groupon out right now that can be taken advantage of to save some money! Also the Civiche is so delicious! It's very tart and has a lot of cilantro and lime. It comes with mini size tortilla chips. I look forward to going back again and trying new appetizers."}
{"text":"This place is still fairly new, and I feel it was a bit unorganized. Their menu is not very descriptive. My party and I were basing our orders off of yelp pictures and descriptions. They do not offer bread or anything as a starter. With all that being said those are things they can work on. 
I had the lobster Mac n cheese, and it was fabulous! My friends ordered fish tacos, and shrimp tacos they both liked their order. Also I specifically went to killer shrimp for the lobster roll, and I was completely disappointed. The waitress said the lobster roll was only served at the California location."}
