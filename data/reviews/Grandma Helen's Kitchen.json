{"text":"Went to Grandma Helen's for the first time. It was delicious. My husband and I both had the Chicken Paprikash. I had a side of kraut and kielbasa and cucumber salad. He had mashed potatoes and cucumber salad. All the food was delicious. For drinks they have cans of pop and I know they have coffee as well. I think the portions are perfect, not massive but not tiny. The place is small, has 4 tables. Very cute atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is clearly a new location based on the past reviews, this place is surprisingly huge inside, in fact every parking space was full but I literally saw no one when i entered due to the extremely tall booths. Very old school European, reminds me of das schnitzel house or sokolowski's but with a more limited menu and no beer. Schnitzel was good, noodles and cabbage were great, I liked the kielbasa in the kielbasa and kraut, but the kraut was too sour for my taste. ( I like kraut Alsatian style, seasoned, but not  sweet or sour).  I'll come backup and try the all white meat paprikash."}
{"text":"We had lunch there yesterday when Little Polish Diner turned out to be closed \"cook needs a vacation\" the sign said) and we loved it.  We had golompki, chicken paprikash, haluski, cucumber salad, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, and dogs with kraut and it was all fantastic!  Homestyle and delicious, and freshly prepared.  Having moved to Indianapolis I rarely see good Polish food anymore (or ANY polish food, for that matter) and since we travel to Cleveland several times a year, I'll definitely be coming back to get my fix."}
{"text":"This post is long overdue.   My fiancee and I were in the Parma neighborhood and were looking for a quick bite to eat for lunch. Per yelp, Grandma Helen's had good reviews and we decided to give it a gander.   The store is small and simple. Bench layout and from what I remember a few tables.  We decided to share a meal that happened to be huge (and we both small). Specifically, we ordered the Chicken Paprikash which came with two sides (we ordered Kraut/Kielbasa and my partner convinced me to eat my greens).    The food was simple but FRESH. I felt as if I was getting a home-cooked polish meal! And then, a man begin to walk around and see how everyone was enjoying the food . It happened to be the owner himself. He sat and talked with us for a good ten minutes, explaining \"grandma\"'s techniques which made the meal even more pleasurable and afterwards just shooting the shit.   The price? Maybe $13-14 total, which filled both of us with a little leftovers to pack up. I enjoyed it so much that I left a $8-10 tip (which went to the waitress instead of the owner; but the owner said shes a hard worker and was grateful we left that tip for her).  Thank you for the talk and giving us the opportunity to enjoy a healthy, ethnic cousine for cheap. Although it's a drive from where I live, I will make an effort to drop by if in the area."}
{"text":"I have dreams about this place-- in Polish.  The stuffed cabbage is the best I've ever tasted. (Sorry mamuszka.)  He does what the home cook just can't do-- bakes the fat little things for days, covering them with layers of cabbage and sauce, so they become tender, juicy, perfectly spiced.  The cabbage and kielbasa side dish is really great as well.  What?  Don't like cabbage?  How sad for you and your digestive tract.  They also have insanely perfect soup, chicken paprikash, daily specials and the ubiquitous Lenten fish fry.  The owner is the nicest guy ever.  The others who work there are really nice and dedicated as well.  This is the kind of locally owned, mom and pop restaurant that you want to patronize.  Help make sure this sticks around for ever. (Sto lat!)  This is not really a sit down place, although they do have a section of tables.  It's mostly carry-out and catering.  Hire him to cater your big, fat, Polish wedding.  I'll come and polka with you."}
