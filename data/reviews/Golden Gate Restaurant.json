{"text":"Food is alright but The one BRUNETTE  waitress who has been there since she was probably 16 should throw in the towel. She's miserable & would rather eat exactly when it strikes 2:00 than wait on people. It's absolutely pathetic. I'm a waitress myself and I would never trest people the way she does. I seen her in the window when I pulled in and wanted to leave cause she's that bad of a waitress and always seems like I'm bothering her meanwhile its her job. If this place wasn't so close to my house k would never come here it's just convenient."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DON'T EAT HERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1st service = terrible, 2nd food was cold and not spicy like i wanted it, when i asked for more spice i was told they don't have anymore. Rice and chicken were mega dry and sauce was thick and tasteless."}
{"text":"if I could do NO!!!!! stars I would they delivored my food. I ordered 5 things 2 of them where wrong. I called asap and they told me how I was wrong and didnt   no what I wanted to order."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while traveling for work. Great lunch special prices! I had the shrimp with vegetables - the veggies seemed very fresh. My only complaint was there was way too much sauce. They were very friendly though and didn't mind me lingering/catching up on work in the restaurant since I had some time to pass before an afternoon appointment."}
{"text":"I want to like Golden Gate. I really do. Heck, it's within walking distance from my house, and I frequently crave Chinese food. But I have not had great luck there. The sweet and sour chicken is spongy. The Lo mein is swimming in oil - I've never had anything like it (and that's not a compliment). The egg rolls are soaked in grease. The only things keeping me from rating it lower: 1) the wonton soup is pretty comforting and 2) people who grew up around here love this place, so I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt - maybe I'm missing something. I'm not terribly hopeful though."}
{"text":"We order take-out from Golden Gate on occasion and are always satisfied with the quality. The salt and pepper squid was slighty salty last time we ordered but is a favorite or ours! When we're at home and need a chinese food fix, Golden Gate is still our spot."}
{"text":"We used to order from here all the time, but then they starting making mistakes every time we ordered. We asked for no peanuts or shellfish due to allergies, and they still put them in. It happened so often we started ordering from another place. We tried them again today and were told there would be no mistakes. Wrong! While the dishes were peanut and shellfish-free, they gave us spring rolls instead of egg rolls. The manager said the employee was new. She said we could have a driver bring us egg rolls in 1.5 hours or get a credit. A credit doesn't work if you never eat here again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant came recommended as having the best Chinese food he'd ever had by a colleague at work.  So, because I wanted to see what kind of food we'd be ordering for our work luncheon my husband and I drove across town and tried the food.
We chose stir fried vegetables,   the house fried  fried rice and salt and pepper seafood.   

All were well cooked, except some of the seafood stuck together and we found the coating on the salt and ppper seafood a little crunchy.  The vegetables were flavourful and well steamed and stir fried with a good variety and bite sized peices.  The rice had shrimp, barbequed pork and chicken, the latter two were a tad dry and little bland, but it was well cooked and less spicy than we're used to.

The service in the restaurant was very good.   The restaurant was clean,  decorated for Chinese New Year which starts next week but there was a cold shift in the air as if a door was being opened and closed in the back at regular intervals.   Well known for it's take out fare,   it's perfect for it's location of Willowpark/Mapleridge  where the majority of residents enjoy the same kind of Canadianized Chinese food that is filling, plentiful and cooked with less spice than food from a more authetnic Cantonese style restaurant.  

It was the majority of  customers who picked up,  and the other diners who ate in confirmed our suspicions.  Not a chinese cusotmer in the place.  

We had enough leftovers for my daughter to try.  She liked the crunchiness of the salt and pepper seafood.  My girlfriend tried the seafood and fell in love with the scallops and liked the rice too.

Would I eat at the Golden Gate again?  Yes, definitely with friends who live in the Southeast and don't like  or can't have much spice in their food.

Would I recommend it?  Defintely would, but not to anyone who is Chinese or someone looking for  an adventure in dining.  

Golden Gate is solid, predictable but just a little higher in price than your average Chinese food restaurant.   This is probably because the neighbourhood it serves can bear the slightly higher price.    

Go in looking for a little bit of the 1960s style Chinese food and you won't be disappointed and you can even have a reasonably priced drink with your meal!"}
{"text":"Well you have to go there 2 or 3 times to enjoy mostly but honestly I looove the waakye but apart from that the rest are kinna Ok the bathrooms were horrible so takeout is perfect and the jollof was awesome too"}
{"text":"My favourite Ghanaian restaurant to go to when I need to cure my  cravings. Best service,  best spinach stew,  decent and comfortable little seating area,  lots of traditional menu choices and many meals cooked fresh (that's why it may be smart to call and order ahead). Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.  This resto is way out deep south, in comparison to where I was staying in DT.

Actually, a bit funny that my Yelp was down so I went on Urbanspoon which had significantly higher ratings, in the 70%'s I believe but I digress once again.

Located in a main road of a residential area, in a big plaza but with only a handful of businesses.  Having just come from the Southcentre Mall, just a 5 min. drive away.

Ordered my favourite, the honey garlic spareribs: fresh, tasty, and enough honey sauce for dipping.  I actually viewed the menu first, and the hostess, Ling, was patient and nice enough that I decided to give it a try.  

It's actually a nice sit-down restaurant, simple and clean.  When you walk in, all the action seemed to be on the left, but I asked to be seated in a quieter section on the right.

While I believe they cater towards the western market, they are Chinese, speak perfect English.

Friendly service."}
{"text":"I have been ordering in from Golden Gate for many years. The food has always been consistently good and delivered hot and quickly. But in the last several months it is consistently not great! They are constantly over cooking the ginger chicken and beef; to the point that it is inedible. Same with the calamari. I will not be ordering from them in the future. I have complained and was told that they are aware of this issue, but nothing has changed."}
{"text":"I came here 2 days ago and forgot to write a review. The customer service was decent and flaky at the same time. I enjoyed the food.. very fresh tasting but I've had better peanut soup.. the FuFu was good. I tried my sisters boyfriends food and he had some fried rice with beef and some other stew and it was so good.. way better then the peanut soup. Overall, I would come back here and recommend them."}
