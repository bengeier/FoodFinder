{"text":"The food is delicious with very generous portions   Good value for the price. Perfect when you need something cheap and filling. Usually very fast service too"}

I eat to the occasion, hence I am not picky when it is to fill my tummy but I've eaten a good restaurants as well.

Yesterday I was running late and only had time to grab a quick bite.  Went down to the food court at Atrium-on-the-Bay and ordered their $5.99 special - General Tao Chicken on Fried Rice and a can of pop.

Portion was huge (much more than I normally eat) but the quality was horrible.  The fried rice was simply soy sauce tinted rice without any flavours (as I have said, I am not picky ... so the mushy texture and the lack of \"fried\"ness was something I fully expect in a food court).  But one has to draw the line with flavours ... there were none other than the faint hint of soy sauce.

The chicken bits were tiny shreded bits heavily battered and deep fried.  I suspect they just hewn away at some leftover chicken from the day before, battered it thick and fried it.  The meat was dry, chewy and fibrous with no taste.  The sauce was a dark sweet-ish sauce (General Tao sauce is normally sweet and spicy with a hint of sourness and has lots of ginger and onion flavours).  Again I wasn't going to be picky at a food court, but if the chicken does not taste like chicken and the sauce is not General Tao's why call it that?  One has to draw the line somewhere.

The only think authentic was the $5.99 can of Coke ... I ate about 1/3 of my meal and I threw out the rest.  This is the first time in my life where I threw out food (I grew up with my grandma, who survived WW2 and we were taught that on some occassions you just eat to fill your tummy ... and I cannot even do so in this case).

Bottom line, just avoid."}
{"text":"Just got my food from this place. It is inedible. Chicken not cooked. Vegetables not cut. It is like everyone there has given up on life. I would give it negative points if I could. -10000000"}
{"text":"Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! *spew*

Wow this place is awesome... at making their food look like it has the potential to actually be tasty. It is absolutely disgusting. I can't even describe it. I got some chicken dish and it was so overly sweet it wasn't even enjoyable.

Discounting the fact that they fill 80% of your plate with plain white rice this place wouldn't be worth the money even if they loaded your plate up with whatever you actually ordered. I paid $11 for a terrible meal and a drink. The food was so bad I opted to toss it in the garbage rather than finish it for the sake of not wasting $11.

In the end I was glad to have so much white rice, I pushed all the other food aside and ate the rice since it was more enjoyable then trying to stomach the other crap.

Don't waste your money (or time) here."}
{"text":"In a moment of weakness I had the pad Thai and 2 meat lunch combo.  It was a little oily for my liking and chicken had little taste aside from the sugary coating."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review as I am compelled to give one so either the restaurant was really good or really bad.
I don't have any complaints about the service, it was okay.  The lady who had served me was pleasant but in a rush.
I had the Orange chicken stired with vegetables and rice and it was terrible.  The rice was bland and the vegetables too oily.  The broccoli lost its color either because it was burnt or it was stale.  The chicken was way too sweet.  I am a guy who has a sweet tooth but this is something that I couldn't handle.  I can't believe I had to throw a chicken because it was too sweet.
It was a waste of money and an assault on my taste buds."}
{"text":"If you want tasteless, overpriced, under portioned bad \"Chinese\" food come here. You'll also get a FREE side of hair in your food if you do."}
{"text":"Thai curry with chicken and vegetables (served with plain rice): 
Flavorless and bland. The sauce was all cornstarch and does not taste like Thai curry.

Asian grilled chicken:
The chicken wasn't grilled at all. Tastes sort of like stir-fry chicken without any seasoning. 

Orange chicken:
Friend of mine described it as being more batter then actual chicken. Too much sugar.

Do yourself a favour and move onto the next place in this boring food court. I would recommend McDonalds (seriously!)"}
{"text":"I definitely feel very weird giving this place a 3-star rating when everyone else seems to have had a 1-star experience, but I honestly really like this place! Yes it has it's faults (hence the 3 star rating), but I am a returning customer. I've never gotten sick like other reviewers have, portions are very generous, and price is quite competitive for the downtown core. This place is located underground in Atrium on Bay, so you can walk underground from Dundas or the Eaton Centre to get here. It's located right across from my school where I also used to work during the summer, so I come here year round at least once or twice a month.

99% of the time, I will get their special (which they have every day). It's a very generous portion of fried rice, general tao chicken, and your choice of veggies (I always get the veggies) or pop for $5.99. You cannot beat that price anywhere near this area! Portions used to be bigger about a year or so ago, but it's still enough for me to have leftovers for lunch the next day. The chicken is not spicy like general tao usually is, and the veggies consist of cabbage, broccoli, and zucchini. It's more of a sweet (albeit, tasteless) chicken that's heavily battered. The one time I got something different, it was flat rice noodles with chicken. There wasn't much chicken in that order, but a lot of noodles. All those heavy noodles quickly filled me up, which I guess was okay because that also meant I had lots leftover for lunch the next day!

I find service to be quite sweet. I ordered off Grabb or Ritual (I can't remember which) once and when I went to pick up my order, they complimented me on my profile picture which is linked to my account. You can also ask to sample their meats and veggies. This place is definitely bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"This place should be closed down by the Health Department as on Friday I came back from a trip and wanted to get something to eat before I went home. Went and placed an order and for some odd reason they decided to serve people before I got serve even though I was first in the line to place an order.

I won't mention what I had but lets just say it was not 100% what I ordered. That was my first mistake and 2nd mistake was eating it cause after a while I felt like someone punched me in my stomach and it started making some noises. 

I went into the washroom and let it all out. They either placed something in my food as it was exactly what I ordered. I should've went back and told them its not what I ordered but I ate it anyway.

I will not ever eat here and as you can see others are giving bad reviews and you should stay away from this place. 

You might even get so sick you may need to go to a Hospital."}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars? I had to THROW my Pad Thai away - and I'm usually not picky with my food. Bland, colorless, a total disgrace. Only reason I didn't go back to yell at them is because it was absolutely packed and I was pretty sure they wouldnt pay me back anyways.

The definitely ' Fusia'd' me over and they will 'Fusia' you over too...

STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"The cashier was pleasant - but the amount of beef I got with a Styrofoam container of bleached noodles was pathetic.  There was SO LITTLE meat that I made the mistake of going back to buy a separate order of chicken.

BIG MISTAKE.

10 hours after I ate their bland food - I woke with a feeling of lead in my stomach.  Then I spent much of the next hour on the toilet.

I don't want to gross you out - but liquid was spewing out of me like a fire hose for many visits during a very unpleasant hour.

I felt nauseous - but the explosion from where you shouldn't explode from was the worst.

DON'T make the mistake I made of eating from this place.

You've been warned."}
