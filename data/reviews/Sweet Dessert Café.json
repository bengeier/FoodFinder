{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite places to eat on the weekends. Since ownership changed, the menue did too. They did away with their best dessert, the red velvet cake. It was so good my fiance and I were planning on buying several of the cakes for our wedding. So much for that. They also make paninis. They are still good, but if you are a fan of the older style, you might be dissapointed. Last time I ate here I ordered the pancetta panini and was assured it would be made the same as it always was. It was not. I would really like to give this place a higher rating, bc they do still have good food. I just prefer the older menu and style over this new one. If you do go, I would definitely recommend trying the waffles."}
{"text":"Brought the kids in to experience the deliciousness!  Martha and Jose took good care of us as always.  My daughter left with a fresh piece of red velvet cake... Her eyes lite up at first bite. She savored each fork full. By far the best red velvet cake ever. Jose and my son decided on macaroons for his dessert. We came home with all 3 flavors. All 3 equally stellar picks. Since it is summer vacation (kids out of school), after tonight's lovely stop at EuroCafe....kids want to return tomorrow for breakfast.  Thank you my dear friends!!  Martha and Jose you are priceless."}
{"text":"Great food and Desserts!! reasonable priced!Espresso is great. Try the new chocolate croissant. The croissants and panini . Their menu has great choices. The staff is very friendly and their service is five stars. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them a 3 star review because I went in for dessert and a cappuccino and left disappointed.   When I walked in, I was greeted by the husband and wife owners, they had a lot of energy and stressed the fact that everything was homemade. I told her that I only wanted dessert and coffee. Again, she stated that everything was made in house and everyday.   There were I think, 4 dessert items to choose from. Creme Brulee, a chocolate lava cake, red Velvet and Tres Leches cake. I love Creme Brulee, so I went with that and instead of coffee, I ordered A cappuccino.   The cappuccino wasn't as hot as I liked, but had really good coffee flavor.   The disappointing aspect of my visit came when I got the Creme Brulee. I noticed immediately that the middle of it was sunk in. It was served in a small round ramekin. When I cracked through the sugar crust, the Creme Brulee was curdled. I was totally separated and had little chunks like the eggs scrambled. (See pictures, they speak for themselves).   I will give them another try, they may have had a bad day, or are still working out the bugs from being a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little cafe. My boyfriend and I went in the morning the other day before I went to work.  I ordered coffee and banana nutella crepes with sausage and eggs while my boyfriend ordered a pizza panini sandwich thing and some salted caramel coffee thing.  The food was great; my crepes were just the right thickness and texture, cooked well with the right amount of filling. The coffee was brewed well and the little bit of the salted caramel I tried was great too.  My boyfriend's only complaint was that the sandwich was maybe slightly too saucy. He was too shy to say so at the cafe, sorry!  But that leads to another thing... The owner lady was great. She was very friendly and talked with us while we were in and made it very welcoming. Most importantly you could tell she cared, as she actually bothered asking for feedback/criticism on the food.  Nice atmosphere too, nice and clean.  Great experience all around, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Brownie Chocolate Milkshakes! So delicious! The customer service and pricing is beyond amazing! Highly recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"I met with a friend for coffee and we enjoyed our drinks. Delicious! The owners are the staff and were friendly and welcoming and attentive to our special requests. They do have non-dairy options! Yay!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little place.Great place, great desserts. This is owned by a husband and wife, they treated us so well. The owner even gave us a cheesecake with two different toppings , so we could try both flavors. We were very impressed by the excellent service, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!  Don't be thrown off by the location.  Sweet Desert has the finest desserts in town, hands down, plus the owners are wonderful, lovely people.  Do yourself a favor and stop in.  You'll be glad you did!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty small cafe and the staff are friendly but the food for the price was a bit expensive.. I ordered a ice cream crepe because I was super excited to finally try it and it was.....not the best. You only get a small scoop with a HUGE crepe so proportion wasn't good, and my crepe was still pretty warm which caused my ice cream to melt very quickly. Basically the crepe was coated with melted ice cream inside and that was disappointing.."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!! The pastries are amazing and not too sweet, just right. The coffee is amazing! Definitly beats startbucks, try the iced coffee!! I would rate this place 10 out of 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"After seeing the good reviews, I went to the store and ordered a croissant. It is disappointing because it is SO SWEET!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Had a French toast, which turned out to be a huge portion! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"We came here at 6:30pm Saturday 10/15/2016 and they were already closed. Their hours are posted OPEN TILL 7PM... DON'T GO THERE!!!"}
{"text":"Simply put this cute little joint is amazing! The customer service is top notch and the couple who own it are incredibly kind and want you to fully enjoy their food and beverages. The bullet proof coffee is serious stuff and all the food I tried was equally good. You can tell they out great effort into what they offer and I would recommend it if you like sweets. Don't let the location put you off either, while it is randomly placed the interior is clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"The chilaquiles are made with chips! NOT corn fried tortillas aka totopos but chips...  No, no! Why?!  The salsa is good & they did a great job with the over easy eggs but the chips are soggy. And sad to say that it didn't have the slices of avocado  we were looking towards eating!"}
{"text":"Love this place it's the friendliest cafe in town. I'm from Ireland and its like a taste of home."}
{"text":"Just got back from London and Paris and had to have a cappuccino - excellent place! The velvet cake was delicioso!"}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast in this neighborhood gem. It was fabulous! Great coffee and lattes to start. Fresh basil in my eggs and over the top French toast! I definitely  will be back... for dessert and great jazz music."}
{"text":"Waffle was excellent light and fluffy, French toast was lovely and the banana and nuts were scrumptious the warm plates were a nice touch.  Staff was very friendly and courteous Will be back  soon"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, not bitter. This place just opened and is owned by a Spanish couple who recently moved here from Venezuela where they owned another coffee/pastry shop. The French toast and poached eggs were very good.  The couple is very sweet. Definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Great little find, we got the breakfast croissant sandwich and Mocha, large portions and great food."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place and have had no issues but if you go there avoid the hot dogs! Took one bite and couldn't finish it :-(. Tasted and looked several days old. If you do go get the Crepes or Montecristo."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite breakfast place in town. I love their breakfast croissant sandwich. It's mouth watering and cooked to perfection. The staff is always friendly and attentive which is excellent. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered a slice of the red velvet cake. It was extremely dry and had obviously been frozen recently. It wasn't even grocery store quality."}
{"text":"The coconut crepe was so good, and the whipped cream was declious as well . I thought the house salad would be bland, but it was actually declious and a good size!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful breakfast! I had veggie crepes. M had pancakes with mango and coconut. The greeting that we and others got on arrival was welcoming and genuine. Great experience. Heads up, the sign on the front of the building only says Cafe."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Martha is a pastry chef with a french latin background and it shows. We sampled 4 deserts and all were delis.  European style. Not as sweet. Freshness and quality 5stars. Coffe was delicious too. Apparently they have a roaster that delivers fresh roasted beans.  Worth the trip. Hidden behind KFC."}
{"text":"A lovely, friendly cafe. Jose and Marta make delicious breakfasts, reasonably priced. They were a delight to talk to while they prepared our orders. The coffee was excellent! I can't wait to go back for dessert!"}
{"text":"Was excited for corner coffee shop and encouraged by cute interior and friendly conversation with the Owner. The regular coffee out of the counter pot was really disappointing. I ordered a chocolate croisant to go. When I got home the chocolate filling consisted of whole unmelted chocolate chips, not nice to bite into, and the runny chocolate drizzle on top ruined the presentation. The end result, however, was good... I put it in my oven, melted the chocolate chips and along with her cream cheesey filling it tasted delicious."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Best turkey panini I've had. Coffee was great as well we had a caramel macchiato and cappuccino.Great customer service. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and FOOD!! Such a treat, will be coming back! Loved the chocolate croissant, chocolate cake, and the macaroons!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice for breakfast. I will definitely be back multiple times. The food is incredible. My wife loves the crepes. The French toast is some of the best in the valley. The omelets are fantastic. We live in the northwest valley is definitely worthy of the drive. Its hard to find a good crepe place. This is one of the best. Lattes are delicious. Its hard to find places that serve quality coffee. They have it all. I highly recommend. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good apple crepes, and excellent breakfast croissant. We got buy one get one free iced coffee, and they are delicious! Very kind staff too."}
{"text":"Awesome food! The customer service is hospitable. The woman that served me had a very positive attitude and made me feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Came for the dessert. Had a focaccia beef pastrami panino. Delicious. Had the tres leches. Delectable. Very reasonably priced was the cherry on top. Go!"}
{"text":"The saying \"don't judge a book by its cover\" truly applies for this cafe. I've overlooked this place for months because of its neighboring businesses (Food City and KFC), but this place is great! The owners were very attentive when I walked in and explained the menu to me. I had the Belgium waffles off their breakfast menu and upgraded my coffee to a cappuccino (definitely upgrade your coffee if you're having breakfast, it's too good of a deal not to). They made sure I had a positive experience every chance they could, even as I was leaving. The prices are unbelievable, the quality is impressive, and the customer service is outstanding. My only regret is not discovering this place sooner!"}
{"text":"The paninis were delicious, fresh, and made with lots of love. The Italian cream sodas were refreshing. The owners were very kind and helpful with our party of 10. If I lived in Tempe, I would definitely frequent this spot."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to eat with reasonably priced food.  They will customize items to your liking.  Amazing panini, desserts, coffees, and shakes.  Worth it just to see the charming owners."}
{"text":"Sandwiches, Fantastic Chocolate Croissant, Fantastic Atmosphere, Fantastic Coffee, Fantastic Couple running the cafe, Fantastic  I've never been to Europe and now that this cafe is in Tempe i never have to."}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 2 years and I love this place! Went there with my mother in law and I got the BLAT and she got the burrito. We both loved our food, and then got cheese cake to split. Coffee here is also amazing."}
{"text":"5/5 stars for obvious reasons. You'll understand once you try it! Absolutely amazing service and food!"}
{"text":"This review should have been written in July, however, we are still talking about this place. What an amazing find! We stopped by this little gem after reading other reviews.... and I am glad we did! We were greeted by the owners son, who was warm and friendly, and offered suggestions. We ordered the French toast, chilequilles, breakfast burritos and crepes! Everything was delicious; we cleaned our plates. The owner served our meal and later came and checked on us to confirm that we were enjoying our food. When we visit Tempe again, this place will be on our itinerary!"}
{"text":"Our first time here was an excellent experience. The staff is extremely nice and attentive it's a small cozy cafe. The veggie omelet was so good. I'd definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"What a lovely couple and nice clean place to have breakfast. Food was delish and savored every bite. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Kind, attentive service from the front counter; speedy turnaround on our orders; and deep, satisfying flavors running through everything from the spicy, smoky homemade salsa to the syrup-soaked Monte Cristo! Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"We discovered this place through our daughter. The chilaquiles was so good. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu. The people are so friendly. You would never think that they served Mexican food awesome"}
{"text":"The food here was great. My eyes were bigger than my stomach because I orderes more than I could eat due to nice portions. The apple cinnamon crepes were delicious so I can imagine all the crepes are. Will be back again soon to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Chocolate milkshake was amazing.  Great Panini's and croissants, too.  Great pancakes and amazing  French toast."}
{"text":"Sorry not living up to the good reviews. Very slow and anticlimactic. These people are working hard but theyre understaffed. Clearly the place is mismanaged . Food tastes good if you don't my thumbing around for 45 min for a single Crepe."}
{"text":"Such a great find!  It's tucked away in a Food City strip mall, so you would never know unless you found it on Yelp!  My husband wasn't interested in trying it because he thought it was all desserts, but I convinced him that the reviews were all positive and there was a good selection of food.  As we walked in, we were greetly warmly by the owner as were all the other customers that came in.  Many call-ahead orders were also picked up while we ate, which is a good sign!  I ordered the Chilaquiles with green sauce and he ordered the Mango & Coconut Crepes.  My meal was served on a bed of tortilla chips which I loved because usually when I order it from other places, it's served on 2 small tortillas that end up soggy after a few minutes.  The tortilla chips kept everything mostly crunchy!  My over-medium egg was cooked perfectly!  The Mango/Coconut crepes - definitely a must!  The perfect amount of sweetness and absolutely delicious!  So glad I found this place and it's less than 5 minutes away!  Cannot wait to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"New business and friendly, enthusiastic owners. My panini was delicious and my cafe latte reminded me of the last time I went to Europe. I hope this little place makes it! It's a sweet little gem."}
{"text":"The friendly owners both greeted us when we walked in, and proudly reviewed their menu with us. I had the Bulletproof coffee with a chocolate croissant, and my husband had a macchiato with a chocolate croissant. The coffees were great and we both LOVED the croissant- sinfully rich with chocolate and cream."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was quaint and the staff was so friendly and helpful.  The food was also delicious and the desserts were even better.  I will definitely return when I'm back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!!! The staff took time to recommend the best and had some of the best customer service I've seen in the Phoenix area. Love it!! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Omg, found this hidden gem by accident as I was shopping at food city. I would have never figured by their name that they sell Mexican food as well. I had a veggie plate with chicken and my son had their strawberry and cream crepes. So DELICIOUS! Im planning to go back and trying their chilaquiles and red velvet crepes :) Yummy for my tummy!"}
{"text":"So yummy! I got the chilaquiles, and they're very filling! I would highly recommend this little place!!"}
{"text":"Best food I have had for a while. As a foodie looking forward to trying new restaurants, I was afraid that I ran out of choices in Tempe. So happy to find this place! Loved the paninis and deserts and plan to try breakfast next time. Jose the husband is from Spain and Martha is French Italian. It is great to eat real food made by real people from the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing dessert and a great atmosphere!! The chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream was divine. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Okay, I think I found my new favorite spot. This gem is hidden in a Food City shopping center. It's a quaint little place. Has about ten small tables. Owner is very welcoming and patient. Food priced fairly. Food we tried: Bulletproof coffee, Monte Cristo was HUGE and amazing. Pancakes were puffy and light. Crepes were filling and fruity. Give them a try."}
{"text":"I had the tres leches cake and it was delicious. Large piece, enough for 2 people. The owners were making macaroons and offered me a sample.  Nice people and great service! The cafe was also very clean. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing Service! I work in the same plaza and decided to give it a try and very glad I did. Reasonably priced fresh ingredients and delicious desserts. The husband and wife owners are so friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I had the Sonoran Dog! It was De-LICIOUS!! I also added the Turkey panini, I didn't realize it had jalapeños on it... it wasn't too bad but I will probably pass next time. On the Jalapeños not the sandwich! It was great. I tasted the club and while it was filling I feel like it was missing something...mustard or a pickle maybe! Great food though. I hope she brings back the Tres Leche cake though. Those pics look Amazing!"}
{"text":"Some of the best desserts we've ever had, and the couple that owns this store is just as sweet if not sweeter! Highly recommend the chocolate croissant and vanilla macarons."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Their service is absolutely phenomenal and the food is delicious! I will definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the very first time 2 weeks ago and I was not impressed what so ever. I read great reviews about Sweet Dessert so I was looking extremely forward to trying the food. I looked at the menu and the chilaquiles looked very appetizing so I decided to go with my first instinct and try these out. When I first started eating the chilaquiles all I tasted was a strong lime taste. Being Hispanic I know what chilaquiles should taste like and these tasted a lot different than I have ever tasted. All I could taste was an overwhelming lime taste that empowered the whole dish. I was not able to finish even half of the dish due to the taste."}
{"text":"Omg. This place is amazing for breakfast. The Chilaquiles are amazing. Along with the hue is rancheros, and porky omelet. Definitely a good amount of food and the dessert options well I am tempted! Will be coming back for more"}
{"text":"I was craving some crepes like a mofo and this place was relatively close so we decided to give it a try.  As we walked in i creeped on other people's food and everything looked delicious. The staff was super friendly too.  I got the strawberry and cream crepes and my husband got the french toast combo. Both were amazing. The crepes were fresh, not premade and not overly sweet. Hubby's french toast was awesome and he said they have better eggs than most breakfast places.   We will be back next week for sure to try more!"}
{"text":"For a place with ordinary food, my sandwich was actually great. This tiny hole in the wall served up a tasty crispy croissant turkey sandwich with just the right amount of grease.   The picture on menu showed greens, tomato, avocado, and onion in it but it only had the first two ingredients.  Perhaps it's an extra add on but I wish the picture was of the default toppings.  The cakes in their fridge display looked amazing especially the super dark-colored red velvet cake.  This is more of a place to frequent if you live nearby and need a very casual and tasty breakfast or lunch.  If I'm ever nearby again, I would consider the desserts."}
{"text":"I wanted a quick bite to eat and a coffee before I drove 30 minutes back home. I saw it was close to me so I stopped by. I was instantly greeted with a warm smile and very informative information about the menu since I have dietary restrictions. The iced coffee was great and the toasted turkey and spinach croissant sandwich I had was AMAZING! I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in Tempe!!"}
{"text":"This place is very Authentic. We ate the food here and went to Paris and were shocked by how close the quality and taste of the food was.   Owned by a very lovable couple from France.   Iced coffee is addictive. Some of the best sandwiches in the greater phoenix area. Hard to explain, very simple but super delicious. Maybe it's due to everything they use is fresh and they make it for you on the spot, none of the sandwiches are pre-made.   Desserts are amazing."}
{"text":"All the employees are so sweet! The desserts even sweeter.  My Fiancé, baby girl Mariya & I came here Friday the 10th I believe.  He ordered the Monte Cristo  (so good I had to taste. Lol) And I ordered the mango waffle w coconut shavings and a side of eggs and sausage. My Jesus, it was good! And of course we ordered dessert!  I had a very creamy, delicious, soft slice of chocolate cake and my Fiancé ordered the churros. This place is definitely a treat. Would recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, delicious breakfast, and friendly staff. We had a couple different breakfast items and they were all good."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little cafe with absolutely scrumptious Sammies and Sweets. We happened to be in the Tempe area and were looking for a place for our family of 4 to have lunch. Being our first time, we were going to order 4 sandwiches to try, but the owner suggested we get two kids croissants for our daughter (aged 3) and son (17 months) to save money and it would be the perfect size for their small appetites. I ordered the Pizza Panini and the Beef Pastrami to split with my husband. The service was a little sluggish, but the staff are so friendly and the food itself was worth the wait! Tried the pizza panini first and the focaccia texture was astounding! Crisp, flakey exterior and an airy, fluffy interior, it was perfectly toasted and paired well with the rich tomato sauce, mozzarella and pepperoni. This one was hands down our favorite between the two. The beef pastrami was good and had a very green, herb-y flavor and with your choice of cheese and veggies, was definitely a hearty sandwich. We ordered their ice blended mocha and salted caramel coffees, and they were just perfect. Sweet, creamy and almost a dessert in themselves! Their flavor was on point!  We ended our meal with a chewy, fudgy brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and, like piranha, we devoted it in seconds! My few notes for improvement would be that the high top pub tables were not the easiest to seat two small kids. One of us had to eat with the little guy on our lap since they didn't offer high chair seating, which makes sense since the tables were too tall for a high chair to meet up to anyhow.  The other critical note is that they do not offer sides with their sandwiches, so if you are super hungry, plan accordingly. Other than that, this is my new fave eatery in Tempe!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We stopped by tonight based on other yelp reviews and we are definitely happy that we did! We all ordered a different dessert And all 4 of us were vey happy with out choices! We had Red Velvet Cake, the Chocolate croissant, the Tres Leches cake and chocolate fondant which was basically a lava cake. All 4 were delicious! The husband and wife owners were pleasant to talk to and very proud of their homemade treats which are all made from scratch by her! Baking was obviously her passion and it certainly showed in the deserts we tried! They also have sandwiches and breakfast. I highly recommend this place and we will definitely be going back next time we want some delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"Yum! We had breakfast & it was delicious! The cafe is small but well kept & wonderfully friendly service."}
{"text":"Very nice service.  Had a ham, cheese, and egg croissant, freshly made and very nice!  The owner is such a great guy - so enthusiastic, really wants you to have a nice breakfast.  The wife had an outstanding cappucino here."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Our food was delicious our service was wonderful and our food arrived promptly. We came over from the Arizona Grand Resort to avoid high prices and we were rewarded with the delicious food and reasonable prices. Thank you from a father of 5, four of which are ravenous teens. :-)"}
{"text":"My family's usual Sunday breakfast. Delicious, low cost for the quality of the food and great service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The food is always on point. The croissant breakfast sandwich is delicious. April the owner is very sweet and really nice person I highly recommend this place it's overall a fantastic breakfast spot. Thanks for the delicious food"}
{"text":"Tried it based on yelp reviews. OMG! We were not disappointed. Everything we had was delish. We will certainly be returning to explore other menu items. We shared a Mex torta and a chocolate croissant. Let me just add that next time there will be no sharing! :)"}
{"text":"Decided to stop and try some coffee. I'm very particular how my coffee is made. We ordered 2 macchiatos and really got 2 lattes. However the coffee was still tasty just not exactly what we ordered. The cafe was very clean and quiet. I didn't have a chance to try the lunch items but overheard other customers happy with quality of sandwiches. Before we left I believe it was the owner who let us try some bite size macaroons that were delicious. Little preview of their macaroons. I'll be back to try some of the desserts."}
{"text":"Coffee is excellent. Friendly service, good food. Nice place to settle in with a good book."}
{"text":"It's a little breakfast place with a very tasty food, tried it for the first time and loved it. The prices were very affordable and the portion of the food was pretty good. The wait time was less than 10 minutes for the food. The restaurant as well as the bathroom were clean and presentable. Very good first experience and no complaints."}
{"text":"So I had thought the place would be a bit bigger. And I went in thinking they had Macaroons but they do Not have them anymore. Not the ideal place I would sit down for breakfast. Food is pretty good. I would say this place is up to you to decide."}
{"text":"Small but not crowded spot with the kind of sweet brrakfast treats i crave. Slow on delivery but worth the wait. Friendly staff with a quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Definitely try the crepes!!!! Great service as well! Can't wait to try everything else on their menu!"}
{"text":"In a word .... amazing. Excellent variety on the menu. Had the Monte Cristo. It was over the top good. Large portion of sweet and savory. The blended coffee is very well done not too much sweet so you can still taste the coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service- Sunday morning 8/21/2016 my wife and two children went in for breakfast. We were greeted by who I assume are the owners of the cafe. They are friendly and helpful. They serve traditional cafe fare (croissants, paninis coffee, breakfast items) and desserts.   My wife and I ordered a beef pastrami panini and chocolate croissant. My two girls split a waffel and eggs w/ spinach and onion. The fact that they willingly ate it is a testament to how good the food is because at 18 months and nearly four years old they can be quite the picky eaters.  For how great the service and food is the café is not without it's blemishes. The decor is minimal and cheap feeling. They do not have accommodations for small children so be prepared to hold the little ones while eating or taking turns eating with your spouse or significant other. The big issue is no changing station for parents of kids in daipers. This may be a deal breaker for some. I will simply just plan for these trips. Even the negatives can be tolerated since this establishment opened in Dec of 2015. Not bad for being open just under a year.  9/10 would eat again"}
{"text":"By far the most amazing, authentic chilaquiles I've had in the state of AZ! The food was amazing and the service was even better."}
{"text":"Amazing veggie omelette!  Like the small cafe feel. Fresh ingredients. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover for this place. Very unassuming location that translates into amazing house made desserts served by super friendly owners. I don't lose weight as quickly as I used to so I'd better pace myself."}
{"text":"Friendly Husband and Wife Cafe With Delicious Home Made Goodness!  When you walk in you are greeted by a friendly husband and wife.... They take much pride in what they are doing and are nice people it would seem.  The salted Caramel Blended Coffee was awesome! This is one of my new favorite places for a coffee!  I ordered the Beef Pastrami Panini and it was a nice little sandwich...  Donna had the Tuna Pate Pastrami and it was good.   For desert we had Lava Cake with Ice Cream and it was really great!"}
{"text":"Ate  here today for the first time. Awesome food. So glad we found this as we live right in the neighborhood!  Excellent breakfast and white chocolate blended coffee!"}
{"text":"Had the veggie crepes. Absolutely awesome . Will stop there anytime I'm in Tempe. Great food great price and even better service."}
{"text":"This is a small establishment in a strip mall with the best breakfast & desserts.  Day one we had the  chorizo omelette, it was amazing.  Day 2 my husband wakes me up and says we are going to the dessert café again.  This time we tried the crepes.  Words can't describe how delicious these were.  They are only open until 1400 so go early!  This place has excellent food, great customer service & is family owned and       operated.  You won't be disappointed!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very cute cafe! Staff was very nice, and attentive. Food was fresh, hot and fast. For a smaller cafe they have a very wide range of drinks. Smoothies, coffee drinks, hot teas, sodas and juices. The family enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had in the Valley. The entire staff was friendly and the food was amazing. I'm just mad I had not tried this place sooner.  The name threw me off a little, I didn't even know they served breakfast. Hidden gem for sure. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed at the cafe in the mega resort where we're staying.  So I ventured in search of local food via Yelp.  This discreet little cafe surprised me!  The decadent Banana Nut French Toast was highly recommended by April, the sweetest hostess and owner.  It was so delicious!  There's more to their menu and place that meets the eye!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast and decided to have crepes, because I so rarely have them, I made it a combo with eggs and sausage.  The crepes were large and very filling, though the strawberry and cream cheese filling was a bit too sweet for breakfast (for me).  Good thing I had the eggs and sausage; it was like a little breakfast and a large dessert.  All together it was delicious.  The service was very good, the lady at the counter was very friendly and the food was out in about 5 minutes with steam rising up off the eggs and sausage."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The people are nice. The food is beyond amazing. It smells great and I want to try everything on the menu!! So far the crepes are my favorite but the Sonoran dog and the quesadilla are pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"Very nice little spot with super friendly staff and yummy food. It is in a shopping center with food city. Sign on outside just says cafe. They deliver with grubhub and hax several orders picked up while I was there. I had breakfast, but lunch and dessert memus looked goid, too."}
{"text":"My husband and I just tried this for breakfast today. Absolutely delicious food. My hubby had the strawberry crepes with scrambled eggs and bacon. I had the banana nut french toast with eggs and sausage. Both were not only delicious they are good size portions and very reasonable prices. You really have to go and check this place out. I promise you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the crepes here, they were well plated and extremely tastey. It has a very relaxed environment."}
{"text":"Delicious! Small place, super friendly staff and delicious crepes. Generous portion sizes."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! They made us feel right at home. We only had panini's, and I will say that I've had better. Would like to come back and try the delicious desserts!"}
{"text":"This morning I had used Postmates to get a Chorizo Breakfast burrito from here. It was nothing short of amazing, so tasty! Definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Jose and Martha are very charming and personable people, and create a very welcoming and warm atmosphere for their guests. I had the pleasure of stopping in for lunch today and the passion they have for their food is apparent  from the second you see your plate and taste the product of their labor of love. The food is fantastic, the peope are wonderful, and this has now become my new favorite sandwich shop in the whole of the Phoenix metropolitan area!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good & cheap!! It's my go to for breakfast. Pictured here is the Porky Omelet (ham,bacon,sausage and egg) with delicious hash browns that was $8.45. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my brunch here with Martha and Jose. I came for the paninis, which far exceeded my expectations, but a bonus: their coffee was just as beautifully done. The owners are a very sweet couple, and so attentive to us. The paninis took about 10 minutes to be made, a wait that was worth it. I will be back on Sunday when they have Venezuelan arepas."}
{"text":"My husband had the Porky omelet and after a couple bites of him sharing I had wished I had that. I ordered the Nutella and cream crepes and was charged extra for requesting strawberries and when I got home after picking up my order they were not included in my meal. So it was good, but a little too sweet for breakfast at 10AM. Also ordered the tres leches because I'm pregnant and I can do what I want. But wasn't spongy and light like it's supposed to be. Let me say though my BANANA MILKSHAKE WAS THE BEST. So thumbs up to that and omelet; thumbs down for crepes and tres leches."}
{"text":"I had the all American breakfast which was good except that my toast didn't come with butter. My husband got the French toast but we were disappointed cause it wasn't great. It kind of just tasted like bread and syrup. Everything else was good though."}
{"text":"I've been coming here off and on for a few years. At first they were amazing. As the years went on, you can tell the quality of the food has gone down. This most recent order has finally made my decision to stop going to this place. I typically order food to go. I always get Monte Cristo sandwiches and this time just like the last, there were egg shells in the egg. A tiny egg shell is fine, but when there's several, no. In the order we also got the Monte Cristo Crepe. When we got it we thought it was the wrong order. It looked like it was a burrito. There were no berries or powdered sugar on them, just a big blob of melted cheese. Nothing to what the description and photo said. It was good while it lasted. Now I'll have to find another place that does Monte Cristo Sandwiches."}
{"text":"Went for the sweets, ended up also happily surprised by the paninis (one beef pastrami, one chicken breast), croissants (tuna pate), and Italian cream sodas (one strawberry, one peach). The food was fresh and delicious, sodas were perfectly made, and the macaroons and creme brûlée--cooked daily on location-- were to die for! Add to that the couple who own this place. Friendly and attentive, they clearly love what they do and put their passion into their work."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is remarkable!  Some of the best sandwiches we've had in a long time.  Tried and LOVED the tuna pate, pork belly panini, and kid's turkey & cheese panini (off-menu option) approved by 2 finicky eaters.  The desserts we spotted at neighboring tables looked fantastic so we took home a few brownies made from 6 different types of chocolate!  The owners are absolutely delightful!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious I'll have to write a longer preview later but I took some photos.  I arrived around 1:30 p.m. and didn't realize they closed at 2 but ordered some crepes as I had a coupon from Yelp and it was delicious. I usually go in there for coffee and breakfast burritos but this was a treat and I was very happy."}
{"text":"Sis and I popped on in here since we wanted to check them out since she saw them on Yelp, and I saw the shop when grocery shopping next door!  We ordered a Creme Brulee, which we ate there, and it was delicious! The sugar on top was perfectly torched (torched? Is that the right word?! Crispy? ANYWAY!), hearing the spoon crack into the soft and silky custard underneath was satisfying to hear! It was the most light, smooth, and subtly sweet Creme Brulee I have had to date. A war was about to erupt between us since it was so good, next time we'll order our own!  We also got a Tres Leche and Lava Cake to go (we wanted to share these pieces of gold with the rest of the family at home!), the Tres Leche is very yummy, it has caramel drizzled on top, and the cake and whipped cream is amazing with the condensed milk drizzled around the cake itself! The Lava Cake itself looks amazing, we haven't had a chance to break into that yet but I'm pretty sure, judging by the other reviews and photos we've see on their Facebook and Yelp page, it's also going to taste amazing!!  Next time we're going to try their panini's - which sound amazing!"}
{"text":"I happened to visit this place for breakfast after almost a year. The place still looks the same, very cute interiors, neatly maintained but the management has changed. I didn't see the lady and man who seemed like owners. Also, They no longer serve the Creme brulee :(  We ordered Hazelnut coffee and veggie omelette. The coffee was much better than the last time but the omelette was disappointing, the veggies inside were a little raw and the whole thing was too bland. They served with two slices of bread and i liked how they had put butter on it.  Overall I wasn't impressed like the last time and the price is definitely higher for a breakfast. I will visit again and hope to change my opinion."}
{"text":"I ordered a chocolate cake togo and its delicious. The staff are very friendly and outgoing. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Had breakfast with the family. I had the carnitas burrito enchilada style. They only have red sauce which isn't my favorite but it was actually really good. My wife had the chilaquiles and she polished her plate. The kids had a pancake combo, Belgian waffle, and Monte cristo all really enjoyed their food and finished almost all of it. The vibe is good and Mike up front was very welcoming and informative. Great service all around. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! My husband loved the iced coffee. I didn't even pay attention to what he ordered because I was too into my ridiculously tasty french toast. My 18 month old also enjoyed the eggs, hash browns, and smoothie!   It's small inside but it wasn't too busy for us to find seating. We'll be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give them more stars! The desserts are fresh, the lobby is clean and the atompsphere is quaint. This place is fabulous! Really hospitable owners, fantastic creme brulee and just a really awesome experience. Their espresso is amazing.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to have breakfast and I suggested this spot as I had never been. It's close to Kiwanis Park which made for a lovely morning of dining and walking. It's located by Food City, which made it easy to find and was perfect since I needed to buy some items from there beforehand.   We walk in and go to the counter to place our orders. The place is small but cozy and I'm glad we were there early before it filled up. I ordered the pancake combo which comes with two pancakes, two eggs, hash browns, and bacon or sausage (I opted out of the meat). I was able to add a topping so I chose strawberries. My friend wanted to order from their lunch menu and got the veggie burrito. I loved my pancakes, they even looked different from your typical breakfast house pancakes. These looked homey and I particularly liked their ruched edges and dusting of powdered sugar. My eggs and hash browns were good as well, I love my sweet and savory choices. My friend liked her burrito too and prices were definitely fair.   I also got a hot chocolate but it wasn't anything special, more on the sweet side than I'd like. The woman who took our order and got it ready was friendly and welcoming and I liked the vibe here. I came in with the intention of ordering crepes so I may have to visit again to try those.  They have 10% cash back through Yelp which is a great deal! Still waiting on mine to go through though."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the leche cake and turkey sandwich I purchased at Sweet Dessert Cafe.  The sandwich was soggy and not well made.  The cake was tasteless and very wet from the milk/cream that it was floating in.  The cashier was very nice and friendly.  I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"I can't stay away from their crepes. I love the dulce de leche crepe and apple and cinnamon crepes. My husband and I stop by every now and then for breakfast, desserts or crepes. He always gets the chilaquiles or huevos rancheros. it's a small mom and pop shop, gets full pretty fast but they have awesome customer service friendly and great food. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Any place that has \"dessert\" in the name I have got to try -- and I finally did this last weekend. Boy, was it good. I got the breakfast croissant + mango & coconut crepe + peach Italian soda. I should have stopped @ the croissant but I cannot resist a crepe. The croissant was loaded w/ bacon (no skimping here!) and the crepes were a meal in themselves. In fact, I got about 2-1/2 meals out of it all. I would have gone back later in the afternoon but life intruded. That's okay, I now have someplace to go for breakfast this coming weekend. I will definitely be frequenting this place again and again. I didn't catch the ladies name @ the counter, but she was extremely polite and talkative. Great service. Great food. Great price. How much more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"Our family thoroughly enjoyed our meals from Sweet Dessert Cafe! They offer so many options beyond desserts, too. We ordered the BLT croissant and it was delicious. The presentation of all items was great, too. I highly recommend this cafe!"}
{"text":"Lovely owners and yummy food. Perfect items for my mouth to nosh on. Took three teenagers here for a quick dinner. We were all incredibly impressed with our meal."}
{"text":"So clean inside and the owners are an amazing couple from Venezuela, Spain. They know what they are doing. I got the creme brulee and it was so delicious and the owner makes it right there on the spot. Whole in the wall, mom and pop shop.   Giving them 5 stars for a great customer service, clean environment, delicious food, price was very very affordable. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Delicious ! So glad we gave this little business a try. The staff there was just so sweet. My boyfriend and I will be coming again soon."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and a real diamond in the rough. Nestled within the Food City shopping plaza is this small little cafe with delicious freshly baked goods. The owners are so incredibly nice and sweet and explained the menu selections to us. We even got some free samples of macarons which were amazing.  I ordered a new item on their menu, the pancetta panini, and shared some tres leches cake. The panini bread was awesome and had the perfect amount of crispness. The pancetta was a little too salty for me but was a good portion and came with Dijon mustard and a plethora of fresh vegetables such as kale and handpicked basil. The tres leches cake looked amazing and tasted lightly sweet with a perfect soft cream soaked cake. The owner said it was the most popular item on their menu and I can see why!  I had a mocha blended coffee to go with my meal which was refreshing with a lot of chocolate flavor and a light taste of coffee.   The interior is cute with Paris themed decorations.  I'll be back for more delicious sweets and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! I got the breakfast croissant and it was ridiculous. There was a slight error but they made up for it and then some without even having to ask. I will definitely be back. Their coffee is killing any of the drive thru places"}
{"text":"Heard about this place, came to check it out and it was amazing ! I got the Americano and the turkey penini, it was so good and the people there are so friendly. They definitely make it a great experience. I'll be going back for sure !"}
{"text":"The service was friendly, but the food was just ok.  The cheese on the sandwiches was American, which was not expected.  Churros had butterscotch in the middle, which was not described on the menu, and the flan was overcooked.  The eggs with hash was the best thing ordered by our group.  Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but this place is extremely affordable and their chilaquiles are authentic tasting and delicious! It reminded me of my mothers cooking :)"}
{"text":"Wife and I absolutely love this place. Staff is so friendly and helpful, and the food is AMAZING. Breakfast burrito is next level when you put the hash browns inside. Also, dulce de leche crepes are"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great customer service. We were surprised it wasn't too busy. Crepes were fantastic and the breakfast burrito was the perfect blend of fillings. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious, but what makes this place is the owners. The are the nicest people and very friendly. The went above and beyond for me when it was my wife's bday and she wanted a creme brulee but the creme brulee is not to go. Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Did not expect this amazing hole in the wall.  They have great service! Coffee and Espresso!!! Homemade deserts! These ridiculously delicious paninis and sandwiches. I personally purchased the pancetta panini and it was so so good! I will definitely be coming again.  Ps: they have a chocolate croissant they make fresh daily in house. I recommend to go early to get them super fresh!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to have something sweet and mistakenly left my wallet on the counter. Did not realize it until after the restaurant had closed for the day. Went back first thing in the morning and April had my wallet ready for me. I really appreciate this establishment. Onto the food had the desert croissant the first day and it was outstanding. Today I had the huevos rancheros and it was also very good. I love this place."}
{"text":"They were super sweet, sweets look delicious but I have a gluten allergy. Don't understand English very well, well the husband doesn't. Coffee, was awesome though!"}
{"text":"Went for my first time today around 11:30am. The employees were extremely friendly and polite. They were also very attentive. Service was speedy! I had a chocolate croissant and caramel macchiato. My boyfriend had a beef pastrami panini.   Chocolate Croissant - I really enjoyed it. It was warm and soft with an appetizing presentation! It's a bit sweet since it's filled with cream and chocolate and then drizzled with more chocolate and powdered sugar! Mmmmmm . But if you love that kinda thing then I highly recommend coming by to at least try this item.  Caramel Macchiato - Nothing amazing to write home about. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either.  I was a bit disappointed by the size of the drink. It seemed really small. If they had put it in a smaller mug, I might not have noticed.   Pastrami Panini - The bread was warm and crisp, and the fillings were flavorful. I thought it was the perfect proportion for a lunch order. People should take advantage of the custom veggies and toppings!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The couple who own it were extremely nice and helpful. So the customer service is 5 stars. The food though is what makes this place great. It's not some ten different kind of sauces and breads place but the food is fresh well prepared and taste great. The coffee and deserts are on point as well. They use good coffee and the deserts are homemade everyday and it actually taste like it. Glad I found this little gem close to my place. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I found them from flipping through Yelp while looking for a good breakfast!! I ordered French toast, eggs and bacon. It was very delicious! It couldn't have tasted better if it came from my home kitchen.  The coffee was also delicious and fresh!  The owner of the place was very sweet!! I will definitely be back when I'm in town !!"}
{"text":"Looked for a unique local breakfast place and found Sweet Dessert Cafe.  This place did not disappoint.  Follow the directions to the shopping center and find this hidden gem.   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Super cute place. It's right between Farmers Insurance & Metro PCS. (FOOD CITY MARKET is the main place you'll see). The food is definitely good. The only complaint from my BF is that they don't provide real cream for their coffee...but hey, we can't have it all. I ordered Chinquiles, BF ordered Chorizo & Egg Burrito and JJ ordered their Chocolate Cake (he already had breakfast and according to him that cake was just mocking so he had to have it to prove a point...so says the 9 year old). Everything was really tasty! I really wanted to try their crepés too and their omelette. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm so happy, I moved recently and found this little gem around the corner. I'm very happy with the food and service, this will be my husband and my new regular. You should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are UH-MAZING! Plus hash browns are a perfect touch! Love this hidden gem. Can't wait to try their desserts!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Sweet Dessert Cafe via UberEats and we were unimpressed. We both got the chilaquiles and the food did not come as pictured nor did it taste good. The entire dish was ruined by the sauce which had an overwhelming amount of lime in it. If we try this place again we will be ordering sweets instead."}
{"text":"Great desserts, we bought a slice of chocolate cake, brownie and the tres leches cake, all very good. Next time we plan to try the coffee. Cute little place, free wifi and very nice employees/owners."}
{"text":"The tuna pate was pretty tasty. Everything was really fresh and clean.  The owners were really friendly and helpful on what to order since I am indecisive!  I also had a bite of the beef pastrami sandwich and that was delicious!  The only thing I'd have to but a note on is that the Tuna pate was a bit runny, so it fell out of the sandwich. And it there wasn't much tuna in it. But besides that it was still good!  We ordered the lava cake with ice cream for desert. The cake was rich and very chocolatey! Good way to end the meal!"}
{"text":"We are in town from Seattle and were looking for a good breakfast spot.  Instead of a \"good\" spot we stumbled upon this establishment serving AWESOME food.  Service is top notch from this family run business.  Very friendly and accommodating for us!  If we are ever back in town we will be coming back."}
{"text":"OH MY WORD!   We found this place in late September early October I reviewed it, it was heavn, I have not stopped thinking about , We all climbed in the car to go ! as we drove up we knew the name was different and the \"Grand opening' made me cringe... as a short Hispanic girl walked out in a uniform top t shirt, my skin crawled, I said are you knew owners? \"YUP\"  is it the same reciepes?\" \"NOPE\"  I saw a Churro where once a beautiful flan or crème brulee once stood. all 5 of us walked out.  Such a disappointment, I wish  the owners that were so friendly  were wise enough to tell us the truth, that they were selling it, I thought  this was no  location for them to do well, (better suited for Scottsdale)  or better area that appreciates European delights now I can tell you it wasn't even worth a taste,  or the long drive  there from East Mesa. so  so sad.  but next month at Disneyland at the Steak house 55 I will be having my favorite crème brullee. Hurray!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp one afternoon while looking for a cafe/bistro near where we live. My husband had a chicken croissant panini and I had a slice of tres leche cake and all I can say is \"amen!\" to all of the 4 and 5 stars reviews already on this page. Absolutely delicious food, and wonderful customer service! We will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place another try. I feel like I came at a weird time. It was too early or something. I went just for a coffee and it was pretty good. I want to return to try the food and complete my review.   The owner seems pretty cool and he is from Spain. He was super sweet and apologized for his poor English. I need to brush up on my Spanish. Try and make his day."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTED with their breakfast.. When they say Belgian waffle I want fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside. Instead I got soggy Eggo looking waffles that came with strawberry preserves from a can. The eggs tasted like it was cooked in a microwave, dense and weird texture. Maybe their desserts would be better but I will never know because I won't come back. I had great expectations with this place based on the reviews and that it's a European café, but the taste of their food makes me feel like they would just buy it at Costco pre made and sell individually. The customer service was nice, though."}
{"text":"Wonderful little cafe tucked away in the same shopping strip as Food City on the corner of Baseline and Hardy. Bomb chocolate croissant - seriously, it's incredible, and that actually feels like an understatement. Super reasonable prices too. This cafe is owned and operated by a married couple - both of them are extremely friendly and personable, and the wife is one hell of a pastry chef. Pro tip, this place is also pet-friendly. Definitely worth checking out. Support local!!"}
{"text":"Food city on one side and this little slice of heaven on the other. In a strip mall filled with chains and mediocre food, this gem is seriously out of place. Lucky for us. Clean enough to eat off the floor and the owners could not be more pleasant.  Food is high end good. It's like a little vacation in Europe."}
{"text":"Seriously this has to be the best cafe I've ever been to! Delicious food and home style gourmet crepes. If you are looking for an awesome new breakfast joint to frequent, I would HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful, fresh pastry! Warm service and very pleasant interior . Desserts : creamy, delicious, fresh, balanced and worth driving to this place. Love it !"}
{"text":"This place is amaze!!! If you are into delicious desserts then this is the place to go. Definitely a hidden gem and worth checking it out. I had the chocolate croissant and coming back tomorrow for their creme brulee."}
{"text":"Found this quaint beautiful place by accident. The owners are very nice & friendly. For sure, the desserts are to die for and the food is also very good. For the items available, you simply can't beat the price. I will definitely become a regular."}
{"text":"My breath smells like cat food!  ...if cat food was actually tuna pâte.  Wow! What a GREAT lunch! This place is a true mom-and-pop shop! The owners are seriously the sweetest people ever. Passionate about their menu, they'll tell you how everything is made, ask about what you like, what they suggest, et cetera. They will talk and talk, show you videos of crème brûlée being cracked open on their Instagram, and call you over to watch them dress their desserts. They'll drag you into a long and pleasant conversation about how a retired professor from Venezuela found her true passion for baking! The husband and wife will tell you how they're making the desert (not a typo for dessert) more sweet --- Sweet Desert is where it's at!  I had ordered myself a Tuna Pâte Panini after the husband, a charismatic Spanish gentleman, convinced me I had to try it.  For the record, Tuna Pâte is tuna salad.  I ended up trading my pal Linh L. for half his Ham & Salami Panini so I can try two flavors but I'll be honest, I wish I kept my panini for myself because it was amazing! I know you're wondering how someone can be this excited over tuna salad but I was.  The homemade pesto paired with the tuna nicely and I had ordered it with European Swiss Cheese. It was refreshing, light to the taste, and incredibly creamy. I couldn't get enough.  The Ham & Salami was alright but that Tuna Pâte Panini was money!  For dessert, Linh and I shared a freshly baked Tres Leches (we got a front row seat as the owner drizzled hot caramel over it!) and a Crème Brûlée as per Ann R. and Amber R.'s suggestion. My homies know what's up because that might have been the best crème brûlée I ever had. It had a very light and subtle vanilla taste, it was ridiculously smooth, and it wasn't too sweet! And that crust... the best!  The Tres Leches was also enjoyable.  It has a meringue topping and not whipped cream.  The caramel had hardened on top by the time we ordered a slice and gave it a nice crunchy texture.  Between the tres leches and crème brûlée though, the crème brûlée stole my heart.    Anyways, I'm completely head-over-heels over this place and y'all need to stop in and fall in love too!"}
{"text":"This morning I decided to stop by at this place because I am dying to try a good chocolate croissant.  So I gave it a try.  The chocolate xrossiant filled with amazing cream and chocolate sauce tastes amazing!  Even my daughter loves it!  I will definitely come back again! :)"}
{"text":"Wow - among the best chocolate cake we've ever had...the chocolate croissant is to die for!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Sweet Dessert Café has the BEST Sonoran Hot Dogs in Tempe. My Family and I just can't get enough of them... so we just keep coming back for more!!! Fast and Friendly Service and Awesome Food! A must try for breakfast and lunch!"}
