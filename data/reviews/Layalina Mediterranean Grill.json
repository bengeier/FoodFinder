{"text":"Layalina has closed; a Chinese restaurant called Schezwan Chinese is going in there now. Rumors abound about why, most revolving around unpaid rent. Goodbye Layalina, we hardly knew ye :( If you're still on the lookout for good Med food, check out Mashawi Grill on Green St."}
{"text":"First off, I have not had a lot of Mediterranean food in my life so I am not a connissour by any means.  However, I was in the mood to try something different, so with a Groupon discount my husband and I went.  My favorite thing was the rice.  I can't say anything else good about it, honestly.  We had falafel as an appetizer.  They were almost black they were so overdone.  The dipping sauce was not at all what I expected--very sour.  Next I had the chicken shish tawook meal.  It was seasoned OK but also cooked to death.  The chicken was extremely dry.  The sauce served with this tasted like pureed garlic.  I think I had about 2 teaspoons altogether and I was still tasting it the next day--ugh!  My husband's steak was better than the chicken but was still overcooked.  Also, their pop machine was not working so they served cans.  Fine, but no glass with ice or anything....just the can.    The music (more like chanting) was cool at first but after sitting there nearly an hour I felt like it was more of a punishment.    I have had middle eastern food in LA and in Madison as well as cooked at home by a Lebanese woman, and those times were better than this.  I will not be going back to this place again.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Our waiter was very sweet and we took his suggestions for what to order (and sorry, but I can't remember what we had except the felafel). In spite of the fact that they do not serve alcohol, we very much enjoyed our dinner and would go back."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and was the first one there.I was seated right away but my order took far to long.I ordered the kabobs sandwich which after waiting 30 min was informed they were out of lamb.so I choose author dish.when we finally got our food it was the wrong order and belonged to another table.all in all the the food was okay and the service was awful.I waited a total of one hour and twenty min. For a sandwich."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and authentic. The business is family owned and service is always good. Prices are very reasonable, especially at lunch, for what you get in terms of portions and quality.  Highly recommended. Atmosphere is also nice."}
{"text":"I spent two years in Palestine (where this family is from) and the food here is JUST like over there.  It's a family run place.  Be PATIENT!  The food is worth the wait.  Take time to taste the olive oil- they get it sent over from the Middle East.  It tastes 100times better than anything we get here!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here for the first time and overall we were satisfied with the quality of food and wait time for our food (we were there closer to 1pm) but the service could have been better. The host was very welcoming but the servers were inattentive and irritable. Hopefully the service will improve over time - I'm sure they are still working some kinks out since they just opened and appeared to be under-staffed.  Food highlights for us were the falafel, hummous and grape leaves. Falafel was fresh, crispy on the outside & almost creamy on the inside. Hummous was perfectly spiced & very smooth. The baba ghannouj was too smoky in our opinion and the pita was a little dried out but overall the food was very good. Will definitely return to try the shawarma dishes."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Layalina and I was not that happy with the overall experience. We ordered kabak sandwich and had to wait around an hour (!) finally to get served. The food was okay in the sense that it's located in Champaign and you won't find a better or even a worse one here. However, the waiting time for each order is never worth the taste.  At the end, I was pretty disappointed by their apparent rude attitude and lack of hospitality (not by the waiters, I guess he was the manager or so) towards us and also to some other people sitting in a nearby big table. As I said, not a very pleasant experience and I would rather prefer going to some other quieter and nicer place where I could be more comfortable and feel at home. Plus the hour-long wait is not worth investing. For the same reasons, I would recommend others to look for a better place instead in Champaign."}
{"text":"Our group of five friends went to check out Layalina: a new restaurant that took place of Minecci's. When we walked in, we couldn't tell the difference: the place looked exactly the same as in its previous incarnation as an Italian restaurant. Perhaps the owner thought that Italy is a subset of Mediterranian, so a Mediterranian restaurant can stay looking the same. The decor didn't change at all! Jumping forward, let me tell you what else didn't change: their kitchen equipment that burns and over-dries food. Or is it the chefs? I dunno, but it doesn't really matter to me how my food ends up dry. The waiter was polite and helpful: probably the most enjoyable aspect of Layalina, but hardly the reason in itself to visit this restaurant. We placed our orders, but were informed that the kitchen was out of a bunch of very generic ingredients, so at least three of us had to change our (different) selections. This was only around 5 PM, and judging by how few tables were occupied, it was hardly because of a large demand that day. Three of us ended up ordering a variety of sandwiches, and the other two oredered vegetarian platters.  While waiting for food, I took a sip of iced water from my glass: Bleeeh! It was some of the most discusting water I have ever tasted in my life! I don't know if sewage water tastes much worse than that, but my glass remained untouched until we left.  The food was prepared in a reasonable time. An appetizer of \"best in town\" falafels (according to the waiter) came almost paper dry and hardened in a deep-frier. I have had falafels many times, but deep-frying them was both unexpected and unpleasant. The meat in my Kabob Sandwich was mixed with choped greens shaped into sausages before cooking. I have had this type of meat - Armenian lyuli - so many times before, and it's always been succulent and some of my favorite. That's why I have no idea how they managed to get it so dry and tasteless in Layalina.  The vegetarian platters came  with clearly store-bought stale pita bread and were also averall boring. And no, serving a lot of pita doesn't make it OK pita. A \"vegetable skewer\" in the menu turned out to be a wooden skewer burned third way like a matchstick, containing one small slice of a bell pepper, a small slice of overbaked tomato and, if memory serves, something as unmemorable as a single onion ring. A ring, not an onion disc, an onion ring. I get it, we gotta be understanding and share whatever ingredients still left at Layalina with people who will have to eat after us. Anyways...  For desert, we didn't get our first choice, because... yes, you guessed it, they were out of it, so one of us ordered something recommended by a waiter. It was a palm-sized flat rectangular whitish pastry with something that _looked_ like a bunch white curly hairs. Not sure what it was, but three people in my party were able to choke down only half of it altogether. It tasted like cold porridge. At that point adults started playing with food, and I knew it was time to leave."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch. Food was just OK. Might consider coming back again, but not for lunch when i have to get back to work. It took them 10 mins to just come up to me and get my order and another 30 minutes to make 1 sandwich. The place was no way near busy (4 tables) to justify this delay. The slow service made me give them only 2 stars, because time especially when people have to get back to work is extremely important at lunch. Their parking lot is a mess.."}
{"text":"This is actually just to let you know that Layalina has reopened a couple of blocks over, at 401 S. First St, the old Minneci's location. I did not go in, but I did see the \"Open\" sign today, Saturday Feb. 8 2014."}
{"text":"I went in for takeout today and had their mixed grill. It was tasty and I will definitely go back, especially for the chicken and the side of almond rice.  Why is that rice so good? I don't know but I will be craving it. The place was pretty full mid afternoon, and looked like it would be a nice cozy place to go on a winters night."}
{"text":"I haven't actually eaten here.  My friend and I went to Layalina at 7:30 pm last night and they refused to seat us, even though they are \"open\" until 10.  It smelled good as we were walking up, and the door was unlocked, and we were really excited to try the food.  After reading some of the reviews on here, maybe I'm glad we didn't eat here after all."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. The service has significantly improved during the past two months as well. The kabobs are wonderful, the rice is fresh and well spiced, the pita bread, the salads and hummus are amazing as well. My favorite is the lamb kabob and the chicken kabob. Love the salad as well."}
{"text":"This place is very good! The staff is friendly and prices are cheap. They have a great lunch special for $5.99 that includes hummus, salad, rice, pita, and a kebab. The lamb kebabs are awesome.  I have also tried many of the appetizers on the menu and have never been disappointed.   Th staff is always friendly and willing to answer questions. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I just had one of the  best lunches I've ever had in my life at this wonderful new Middle Eastern restaurant. Five bucks bought me a fabulous falafel sandwich-tender falafel and plenty of veggies and hummus to moisten the pita-plus delicious fries and a Pepsi. For five bucks! At that price I could afford to order a fresh and tangy tahini salad on the side. The server was really nice and the food didn't take too long to arrive. I enjoyed the soothing ambience, the roomy and private booth, and the soft Middle Eastern music in the background. Their bathroom could use a little sprucing up, but that's my only complaint. Five stars to my favorite restaurant in Champaign!"}
{"text":"UPDATE : VERY SORRY to hear about the fire!! Hard to believe, such bad luck. I surely hope you had good insurance.  Be strong, start over, we need your skill and tasty food!    Please let us know if you get another start somewhere else, hopefully still on campus.  ------------------------------------------------   Starting glitches have been mentioned. Somehow that rang an uncomfortable bell!   (Not to turn this political, but I wish we wouldn't hold an immigrant family offering excellent food, at standards degree of magnitude higher than the standards we hold our government and Dear \"Leader\" to. Another difference is between a family possibly risking their last penny into a business and a bunch of entitled profiteers in D.C. burning billions and trillions of OUR, not their money!)  Sorry for the (justified yet off-topic) rant. The good and on-topic news is that the dishes themselves are very good, and by no means do I regret stopping by Layalina.  I tried it today. I am only withholding five stars because I plan to visit it again and (hopefully) confirm my positive impressions.  Yes, the place looks like a cafeteria. Golden Harbor, the best Chinese place in town, doesn't look differently. If you want fancy ambiance, avoid. I don't go there for dates, but for the FOOD.  Layalina didn't seem dirty to me at all. It seems reasonably clean as food-making is concerned (I can't hold them responsible for the aspect of the building), the cooks even wear those single-use plastic gloves, which I liked. [Yes, please keep it all safe.]  Are there some minor organizational glitches having to do with them having just opened? Probably yes but, really folks, let's give them a break. Starting a business today.... in these times.... should we expect perfection? It seems to be a family, a very nice family (the counter guy was friendly and polite) which went into restaurant business and.... guess what.... the FOOD so far made me happy. Remember the food? We almost don't have this kind of tasty Mediterranean cuisine in U-C anymore, with Istanbul and Holy Land gone. The miraculously surviving campus \"Jerusalem\" is an ongoing joke, not only (famously grumpy) service-wise, but also the quality of the food isn't there. I really hope this new place survives.  At Layalina I had a chicken shaorma sandwich... excellent. Very good deal, at a low price. Mouth-watering, nicely marinated, tasty yet not strident sauce. I also got an appetizer plate - very good homemade humus and baba ganouj [ganoush], the stuffed grape leaves also good, their filling I mean... but they need to find better, less stringy jarred grape leaves [not easy in the U.S.] Overall very happy with food quality so far.  I really wish them good luck, and to improve on the minor \"glitches\" - the potential for a nice place to consistently get exciting food is definitely there.   I plan to go back and \"update\" my \"stars\" soon, either up or down. Hopefully up."}
{"text":"When we arrived and ordered for to-go, they didn't have the shawerma I came for. However, the chicken sheesh tawook with rice and falafel I did order was fantastic. On top of that, we were both given complimentary baklava and a water after we sat down to wait for our order. It was delicious and well made. The portions, we discovered, were plentiful and the food was astoundingly delicious.   While we sat in the restaurant, we found the place to be beautiful and the music was very good. I would happily recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Just had my first and last dining experience at Layalina. I tried the baba ghanoj as an appetizer and the meat shawera for lunch. Both were very disappointing. The baba ghanoj was very bland & then the meat shawera sandwich had too much of the wrong seasoning, in my opinion. There was something that was just off about the taste of the meat. Maybe the chicken would've been better as a previous reviewer stated, but I will not know because I was so disappointed that I  will never be going back. The only plus was that the service was fine, waitress was really nice."}
{"text":"Since their disastrous fire it was great to see them in a larger and nicer space. We got the hummus appetizer which was smooth, luscious and attractively plated. I'd seen grain-enrobed meatballs in cookbooks so I wanted to try the Kibbee. It tasted good but could use a sauce. I mopped it in the hummus. The service was a bit slow. We had to ask twice for napkins & we had no utelsils until the entrees came. I attribute this to the crowded room & the staff being overwhelmed. But the aromas were so inviting we just hung in there. My wife & daughter got the chicken kabobs & I had the veggie plate. Their kabobs were nicely seasoned & falling off the skewer tender. But they thought it could have used a sauce. I got more yummy hummus, good stuffed grape leaves & falafel. I didn't have baba ghannouj before so I can't compare. I liked the smokiness but it put off my wife. We thought the grilled veggies needed more time. Nice char but they were mostly raw. We really loved the 2 rices, especially the pinkish rice that had wonderful flavors we couldn't place but loved. All in all there are kinks to be worked out but we got good value for our money. Very tasty food & we will be back."}
{"text":"Lumetta can take a punch.Could have been better somewhat not sure about the 391 class lots of operating system stuff really its tough."}
{"text":"My husband brought me and our two smallest children after he had been the day before with a friend. I love Mediterranean food, but have not been able to really enjoy it since having been to Israel over a year ago. We ordered falafel sandwiches for ourselves, and a plate of falafel for the kids. We also shared a plate of hummus. The falafel was tasty, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Exactly how it should be! I would prefer homemade pita, however. It's really not that difficult to make, and it would really take the food up quite a notch since pita is served with everything. I make my own hummus quite a bit, and it's hard to pay for it elsewhere, but I would gladly pay for it here! I like how they make a well of Olive oil/lemon juice in the middle of the hummus. I give three stars, simply because I'm always hesitant of a new restaurant that does nothing to freshen up the place before opening. Also, the bathroom door was off the hinges. I guess that will be a good marker as to how attentive they are to detail and cleanliness. Our waitress was attentive enough, not overly friendly, but she took care of our needs."}
{"text":"Food is good but it looks terrible inside and outside. Not a place for a date but the services and food are wonderful."}
{"text":"Best mediterranean food in champaign. The ambiance is great and the food is amazing. Except the slow service there is nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Only serving is good. Never try grilled chicken or lamb. The shape and appearance of grilled lamb here is very very disturbing when eating."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty.  But the service was so horribly bad, I can't bear to give this place more than two stars.  We waited *literally* (no exaggeration) for 50 minutes for any of our food to arrive.  After the first 20 minutes, we started asking our waiter what the problem was, and each time we asked, he assured us that it was almost done and would be out in just a couple of minutes.  In other words, he lied to us repeatedly for over 30 minutes.  This *might* be excusable if we had ordered anything that could conceivable take long to cook.  But we didn't.  In fact, most of our order was stuff that should be ready immediately (tabbouleh, baba ghanouj, pita (!)).  We also ordered falafel and some grilled meats, and I could understand those things taking maybe 15 minutes to make on a busy day.  But even so: 1) the other dishes should have come out right away--at least pita bread, and 2) even a grilled chicken skewer should never take 50 minutes.  After 30 minutes we actually asked the server to bring us some pita, and he said he would, but didn't.  We asked twice more over the next 20 minutes, and each time he told us the same thing: \"Of course.  I'll bring it right out.  Sorry about that.\"  We never got it.  By the time the food started to arrive, we were already pressed for time and had to go, so we basically had to take a few bites and pack up the rest to go.  We enjoyed it the next day, and as I mentioned, it did taste good.  But having to basically skip dinner because of the utter incompetence and dishonesty of the service left us with a bad feeling about the place.  Maybe you could get food to go (if you order early enough), but I can not recommend eating at the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"We went for a return visit at the beginning of April. The food was just as good, and the service was improved- though there was still a bit of a long wait to get appetizers, and then the main courses came out a little too fast for our taste. But still vastly improved from the first visit.  They now have a nice choice of high-quality teas and turkish coffee to finish off your meal.  Only wish beyond the food timing issue? Ability to BYOB since they do not have a liquor license.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Yummy food and super nice staff. I don't know if I would every sit down and eat here again but I'd defiantly would order out!   Food: delicious! Large portions and a lot of sides!  Staff: very nice people but service was slow towards the end of our dining experience. Other people were waiting just like we were to get their attention.  Atmosphere: place was small but cozy. The dining area close to the doors got very drafty and cold.  Bathrooms: avoid if you can! Small dirty and no paper towels."}
{"text":"My wife an I are from the middle-east, so we have tasted wonderful middle-eastern food many times (basically grew up with it). Chambana locals might consider this restaurant pretty good, but based on our standards it is mediocre at best. A few reasons why as examples? The pita bread isn't homemade, and it was thin and dry. The humus was ok, nothing special.. Vine leaves weren't wrapped well and didn't seem very fresh.. Shawarma was overcooked, though the seasoning was pretty good.. And the cookies for dessert were pretty bad (though the Turkish coffee was good). It's the only choice for middle-eastern food in the area, so worth going once in a while.. But don't get excited."}
{"text":"This place opened for business yesterday,  and I had the pleasure to drive down to Champaign with my friend and spotted this amazing place.   I can't emphasize enough how good the chicken shawerma plate tastes! The food was great and nice customer service. One of the waiters informed us that all their dishes are zabiha halal.  The new place had great hygiene and a very nice ambiance.  Clean store and attentive waiters, I really enjoyed my experience there. The food was nicely decorated, with no sacrifice in taste.  Its a hard working family owned business that delivers delicious food with amazing customer service. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here last weekend, 3/10, and was appalled at the service. We were inexplicably seated in a side room, even though there seemed to be ample seating in the main dining room and were promptly forgotten about. It took around 10 minutes to get water at which time an appetizer and food order was taken. After waiting nearly 50 minutes, the entrees finally arrived and soon after one of the two appetizers arrived.   The hummus was extremely average but the bread was tasty and seemed to be straight from the oven. The schwerma sandwiches were seasoned well and were more than enough food. Meals were also served on paper fry boats and wax paper which seemed unusual for the atmosphere. If I eat here again I'll be getting take-out."}
{"text":"This is an ordinary place with very ordinary tasting food. The best thing I can say about it is that they give you a lot. The Kofta platter was acceptable. The chicken skewers were OK. The shawarma platter was not good. The meat comes with basmati rice and sometimes a small side of cucumbers. The yoghurt sauce was not fresh. The Layalina platter was a combination of the above plus some beef. I do not think this is a bargain because dinner comes to about  $17/person with tips etc. Perhaps OK for a college town. The bathrooms are deplorable, one stall did not have a door and the other one was so tiny that it was impossible."}
{"text":"Came in here with my boyfriend and we ordered the chicken shawarma platter and chicken shish tawook(?). We waited for almost 30 mins to be told that they ran out of chicken for my shawarma. I somewhat wanted to leave but I was too hungry so I settled for the meat shawarma. The plus side- the server was nice.  After receiving our food, I wasn't completely satisfied. I wanted more flavor. It was close to being bland. However, I did try the chicken and it tasted better than the meat shawarma. That was somewhat annoying.. knowing that I might have enjoyed my meal more if I received what I ordered.   All in all, although they serve a good portion for the price, the food itself isn't impressive. I only liked the chicken."}
{"text":"The overall experience was a little less than OK. I went for lunch with my girlfriend in the hopes of having some delicious skewered meats.   We split the mixed grill which came with a small order of hummus, baba ghanouj, and pita. The hummus and baba ghanouj were pretty tasty however, the pita was extremely dry and seemed a bit stale. The mixed grill arrived and it was a pretty large portion: two different types of rice, chicken, beef, ground lamb/beef, and grilled vegetables. Every item on the plate was extremely DRY and under seasoned. Luckily I had saved some hummus, otherwise I'm not sure if I would have been able to swallow the chicken (moderate exaggeration).   After a less than satisfactory meal we waited over 15 minutes from when we gave our card to the waitress to pay for the bill until we were able to leave (the restaurant was at about 50-60% capacity at the time).  I wanted to enjoy this place, I love Middle Eastern food, but I think I will have to try the other places in town first before I give Layalina another chance."}
{"text":"Champaign-Urbana residents who miss the Holy Land on north Neil St. that closed a few years ago will appreciate Layalina.  Though the two restaurants aren't related, the Layalina menu brings back most of the old Holy Land favorites to C-U. The cuisine could probably be described as Lebanese/Palestinian, which explains the similarities.  I decided that Layalina's sixth day of operation was a good time to try them out. As with any new place, there's still a few teething pains. Service was good, and my meal came out in reasonable time. I had the chopped Arabic salad and chicken shish tawook (two of my favorite meals from bygone days at the Holy Land). Both were excellent. The salad was ample in size and fresh. The chicken had an enormous portion - three skewers loaded with well-marinated chicken, a huge portion of rice, and grilled peppers and onions. Simply delicious!  I'm glad to see the restaurant busy tonight, so the grapevine is working. I'll be trying several of the other dishes soon - can't wait to try the hummus and kufta kabab. This new addition to C-U is a winner.  They're open for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"As a middleeasterner I know what good kabob should taste like, and Layalina passed the test. Good food; great addition to CU restaurant pool."}
{"text":"I ordered the Stuffed Grape Leaves and Meat Shawarma.  The Stuffed Grape Leaves were not very stuffed. They were just okay. They ran laps around the shawarma though.  The shawarma bread looked about as lovingly made as some forgettable store-bought pita, which it probably was. No grain, no texture, no spices, nothing going on here. The meat was remarkably dry. The sauce, whatever it was, was tasteless and scant. The shawarma, akin to the grape leaves, was not very stuffed. It lay almost flat.  The food was overpriced for what it was."}
{"text":"This restaurant has reopened at the corner of Springfield Ave and 1st St, where Minucci's used to be."}
{"text":"Layalina just reopened after its prior location burned to the ground a few months ago a block away. It's very good Middle Eastern food, which we've needed here in C-U for a long time. Just a tiny bit pricey for a student budget, but the portions are large. Almond rice was delicious with my chicken dish.  My friend had the lamb shewarma platter and said it was delicious. The service is cordial."}
{"text":"Well, that didn't last long.  Layalina burned to the ground Saturday, November 16, 2013."}
{"text":"The only thing I'm sad about is that I've lived in Champaign for six months without going to Layalina. My husband and I went and we had the kibbeh, foul medammes, cheese arayes, mixed grill platter, and a meat shawerma sandwich. We had a lot of leftovers, but the food was delicious. The meat shawerma was heavenly! Our food came out pretty quickly. They give you fresh warm pita bread with your order. It should be noted that I am Middle Eastern and I've had plenty of authentic Middle Eastern food. This place is a gem. We're definitely going to be regulars here. I can't wait to try the falafel and the desserts."}
{"text":"Really good food. The fact that it's all Halal makes it even better :)   Some dishes that stood out to me: Layalina Mixed Grill, Baklava.  Only downside is the music playing in the background. Which I understand is to enhance the atmosphere. But I would prefer to have no music at all :P"}
{"text":"Layalina Mediterranean Grill has found a new location at 401 S. 1st St., just around the corner from the location at 40 E Springfield Ave that burned down in November, 2013. On February 6, 2014, a new banner was hung at the location of the former Minnecci's restaurant. In a photo I have posted you can still see the Minnecci's sign standing in the parking lot at the corner of First and Springfield. This restaurant has a lot of promise and as they are starting out in their second location let's hope they can overcome some of the service issues which plagued their forerunner, Holy Land restaurant, formerly located on N. Neil St. and their original Layalina location at 40 E Springfield Ave. that burned 10 days after opening for business in November, 2013."}
{"text":"I keep thinking about kitchen nightmares, and how this family is perfectly setup to be on an episode. First off, owners smoking on the patio is not an attractive quality and if you are dining outdoors they didn't have respect to take it out back. Secondly, and this goes for many restaurants..don't have a novel for a menu. 6 items tops and 2 appetizers that you can do consistently and be good at it. The meat grilling is on point and all their kabobs and chicken is good. The shawarma plate was crispy which means it was reheated and served. The falafel was tasteless and a gooey green inside paste and the dip was watery. I know they can do better but it seems they have lost the will to cook and shows in the food. Cut down the menu, and streamline operations and you'll be golden. I will check back with them time to time and see if anything has been corrected, the waitstaff was polite and attentive and felt bad that some items that were on the menu couldn't be served. Again, watch some chef ramses episodes and take note of how he makes them flourish."}
{"text":"I had both the Chicken Shawarma and Falafel Sammich. Both amazing.   The experience for me was like being a T-Rex eating up Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park(alternate reality). I devoured him and he was delicious. Nom Nom.  To the father and son working the restaurant. I'm sorry for your loss. I wish the place didn't burn down. I hope you can get up again find a new location in Champaign and serve up some more delicious Shawarma."}
{"text":"Food was good but it all came out 5-10min apart. Actually had to have one dish wrapped up because it never came out. The rice was good and so was the hummus. Will go back but gonna wait a while to see if they get it together"}
{"text":"Just finished an early dinner here. I had the Shawarma platter. My wife had the veggie platter, and we shared the chopped tomato:cucumber salad.   My mixed lamb & beef shawarma was very tasty, with two varieties of rice.  My wife loved her veggie platter.   We'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Layalina is OPEN again in the old Minneci's building on Springfield.  My husband and I went there yesterday and it was very good!  We both had the meat shawarma and some falafel.  Definitely worth going back and the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"You know what? I really enjoyed this place. Cute little mom and pop restaurant a few blocks away from the Urbana train station. The young gentleman serving us was an absolute pleasure, and we really enjoyed our vegetarian sampler entrees. The falafel was very nice, perfectly crispy and not dry at all. The prices were very fair. Hummus and baba also very flavorful. The entree came with rice and they gave us TWO kinds of rice that were both perfectly cooked and seasoned. The rice alone was large enough to fill me up! So good! My only wish is that they had a red lentil soup to start with, but otherwise, we had a very nice meal before catching a train back to Chicago. Come here and support local business!"}
{"text":"We heard heard good things about Layalina and were eager to try them out. We went for dinner and shared the Tabouleh and Kufta Kabob--and still had enough left over for a lunch portion. We wanted dessert, but all they had left was Greek yogurt cheesecake, and we're not cheesecake fans. The young lady serving us was cheerful and more or less attentive. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Come for the Mediterranean food, but not for the Mediterranean service. Upon arrival, we were seated promptly, however the time it took to get our orders in was quite a while. I had asked the waiter for a side of pita bread to go with my meal, but we did not see him for the rest of the night. Maybe he got lost in the kitchen where we frequently heard glasses being dropped. Our drink glasses were never refilled, and I had to ask for the bill, as we waited about 10 minutes after finishing without any sign of our waiter. Sad to say that such a wonderful meal could be spoiled by such terrible service. This place has a lot of potential, but definitely need to work on a couple things before they move up on my list. For the time being, I will definitely need to find another place to satisfy my craving for chicken shawerma."}
{"text":"Parking is awful:(. Food very average.  Waitress very sweet.  Place needs cleaning and toilet paper:(. Would not return:("}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch, got dolmas, baba ghanouj and falafel. Food is cheap and tasty. The service was a little wonky (when we asked for more time to order, she gave us approximately 30 seconds), but the food arrived in a more than reasonable time.  The vibe is interesting, the kind of place where some illegal deals are made. I'll absolutely be back."}
{"text":"The overall experience was just OK.  The food was ok, we ordered lamb kabobs and then the waitress came back much later to tells us that they were out of lamb kabobs, so we ordered lamb chops.  She came back much later to tell us that they were also out of lamb chops,  she was very nice but also very slow.  I don't like to knit pick all the little things, but there were enough to take this from a \"good\" to \"average\" experience."}
{"text":"I had the Shawerma platter and falafel, and it was very tasty. The waiter was very nice and polite too. I had a hard time picking something from the menu because it all looked so good..."}
{"text":"I tried out the kabob platter and they give you a huge chunk of food. However, service is as slow as a turtle; my crony and I were the only ones there and we waited for a long time to get our food. Our food didn't even come at the same time. To make matters worse, they got my friend's order wrong."}
{"text":"Layalina's Mediterranean Grill recently opened up and is very delicious. Champaign-Urbana has been missing a good Mediterranean restaurant and Layalina's has filled the void. The entrees are amazing with options ranging from shish kabob and lamb to quail. This place will not disappoint you at all I guarantee."}
{"text":"Really affordable pricing! Delicious food! Just wish they served alcohol (maybe I'm just a lush though).  This is a great place to go if you're vegetarian/vegan and they have a very friendly staff. We'll be back."}
