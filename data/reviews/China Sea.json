{"text":"WOW! That was very good! I had the dragon & Phoenix with sweet and sour soup, and everything was spot on. I had delivery and it was fast and everything was warm. Very nice, thank you!"}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant has got to be one of the best in the City. There food is always so fresh tasting and never is greasy. I love their shrimp Fried rice. Soooooo Much shrimp and scallions. Service is quick and the family is very friendly. I am very adventurous when it comes to tasting different menu items and everything I I've tried was Absolutely Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Summary: don't expect that you can change any order even with offering to pay & even if it already an option and then paying for it : such as adding more vegetables. If they say they will do it for a fee , don't expect that they actually will.   Quality of food is ok - not great, but by no means terrible. At least they offer delivery for small fee. Delivery time is normal -45 minutes.   Ive ordered 2x and same problem both times, 2nd time i was assured on phone that the order would be correct, but it wasn't."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. They may not be the friendliest on the phone, but its becuase they are so busy making really good food."}
{"text":"Really nice people. I buy from them all the time. I buy sesame chicken  from this establishment. Always a lot of food and hot. However found a bug in my hibachi. They were nice enough to replace, but still had bugs in the hibachi. I learned to stick to sesame chicken ."}
{"text":"I ordered the sushi (salmon nigiri and rolls). I brought it home. I opened the container and immediately threw it away.  It was obviously off, but what can you expect for 10 bucks?"}
{"text":"I just moved to Cleveland from the east coast and am still trying to find good local places in downtown. Figured I'd try this place out last night and was a little disappointed. It's clearly geared towards the 'american-chinese' style of food and the so the ambiance is really nice.   Here's what we got: Won-Ton soup = the worst wonton soup i've ever had, they used thick dough and barely any meat in the wonton, soup was bland Ohio Dream Roll sushi= not bad, rice was a little stale but the avocado made up for it Lobster roll Sushi= worst sushi roll i've had, bland and I couldn't even taste the meat Spicy tuna roll = can't mess up spicy tuna, would get this again Spicy Chicken curry = typical chinese curry flavor, not spicy enough though, but very average tasting  If I didn't live 2 blocks from this place, I wouldn't go back. I'm sure Cleveland has some better Chinese places..."}
{"text":"I've had the Hunan Chicken and the Sesame Chicken, which were okay, especially the former. But today I had the Sweet & Sour Pork, and about all I can say about it is it was cheap. It was oddly tasteless, breaded to oblivion and the tiny bits of pork were tough and cold. Best part of the meal was the steamed rice, which tells you something. Stay away from the #1!"}
{"text":"It is by far the best chinese delivery I've ever had. The vegetable soup and general tso's tofu is a must try. I took the general tso's with me to a christmas party and both kids and adults were impressed with the taste. All meat eaters were in agreement that they'd eat it again."}
{"text":"Where else can I get egg rolls made the way I like them? China Sea. Not the friendliest in terms of customer service but efficient in when it comes to timeliness. I have never had to wait long for an order when placing a walk in order."}
{"text":"Here's the thing. I used to go here probably once a week while I was working on graduate school applications and try to eat some sushi and mooch off of Starbuck's weak wifi signal (a few doors down). I mentally gave it two stars, yet I still went, so...that's that!  I've only had their sushi, and to be fair, maybe I shouldn't expect Japanese sushi from a place called \"China Sea.\" I kept getting their combination - which had three different rolls in it, for about $12. Two of those rolls (tuna and yellowtail, I think) would be fine. Nothing to rave about, but edible and a small step up from grocery store sushi. The third, some mahi thing, not only CONSISTENTLY smelled like fish (a BAD sign for sushi for those of you who don't know - it should be odorless), and tasted so bad that I would have to poke the fish out with my chopsticks and just eat the rice and seaweed. I know you're asking yourself why I kept getting it - the combo was just so cheap! And I kept thinking it'd get better!  Also, even when I made it clear I was staying in the restaurant (by setting up and plugging in my laptop), my meals still came in take-out containers, in a plastic bag, with soy sauce packets. I would then dutifully have to unpack this all at my table in order to eat it.  The restaurant is a bit dark and grungy - I would take a friend there, but never a date.  Maybe this isn't fair. I never asked them to deliver for me (and cmon, people bringing me food to my house? Definitely a plus!), and I never ordered anything but sushi - but in fairness, this was before Tomo opened and after Sushi Rock closed for remodeling, so aside from Constatino's premade sushi, this was the only sushi nearby!  Still. Sorry China Sea, but it's a two star for me."}
{"text":"Delivery was quick, the crab Rangoon was good, egg roll was decent (yea I've had ba egg rolls), the entrees were another story.  Lo Mein, it's written as \"Lo mein Dinner\" but don't let that fool you, it's just noodles in a plastic box. They were both flavorless and the pork looked weird. Maybe old like made in the morning and served all day, we ordered at 9pm so yeah, they were gross, tasted rank, mushy texture.  Every Chinese place seems to be the same, just order fried food, anything else is no good."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese delivery in the Euclid area. They're one of few places that deliver to my work."}
{"text":"Oh geez. Not good. I ordered a rainbow roll and the szechuan green beans. The fish on the rainbow roll was cut well, and had a nice mild flavor, but was kind of a weird temperature for me. I did walk a block back to my office though, so maybe it heated up or something.   However the california roll it was wrapped around was basically a big ball of rice with a skinny little slice of what should be crab and cucumber, but all you get is the taste of starchy, kind of hard, rice. (note the pic) And the greenbeans were swimming in oil, although had good flavor, not spicy like they should be. The roll was $9 and the green beans $4. I wont go back for the sushi for sure... I might try the regular chinese food, ask for light oil. It's so close to my office, I'm a sucker ."}
{"text":"Ugh.  I went here while on jury duty on day for lunch.  My food was pretty average, but my one star is because the girl working there was SO rude.  I wish I could find my other review for this place because I don't recall the entire sordid tale, but I do not know what exactly I did that angered that girl but she was nasty to me.  I will never go back.  If a place's food isn't so great, I can manage, but if you're rude on top of it, that's big NO in my book."}
{"text":"In Malton you find China Sea who doesn't let itself self be influenced from the major south Asian community where mostly Indian restaurants and Hakka Chinese restaurants have a mark. Yet it sticks to its basic roots as if they were in Chinatown. It's basically your typical Chinese takeout which offers you a large menu with pictures on the wall, good sized portions and food that is better quality then the 30 year old d√©cor they got going. They keep the sodium level in control so we can adjust using the given soya & hot sauce packs. Lady in the front is nice and recommends dishes and offers free soda at times with decent size orders. Don't expect to be blown away but it's an awesome place to grab good portions for your large party. They do delivery and phone orders for pickup. quick service. Only issue I had was that  I could smell a little old oil on the fried tofu which had become bitter. Do give this a try among the other near by restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a very run-of-the-mill American Chinese restaurant.  It is not at all authentic.  The food is average in every way.  I haven't had anything truly bad here, nor have I had anything that was really all that good either.  The best aspect of this restaurant is the atmosphere; relative to the low price, you can sit down in peace and quiet in a relatively spacious, well-decorated environment.  The place looks small from the outside but has additional downstairs seating.  The prices are lower than what you would expect from a decent sit-down place like this."}
{"text":"So, so good. I have no idea what the other people are talking about. I'm Chinese, from New York (Queens), and this is the best Chinese I've had in Cleveland. I haven't had any food delivered, only takeout, so I can't speak to the delivery service but OMG, the food is delicious. Excellent, excellent, takeout. Their pepper steak is freaking phenomenal. I was sooo sad when I finished it (btw, the portions are great--I'm just a glutton). The orange chicken was crispy and juicy and awesome. I'd say their sushi is mediocre but it's China Sea, and they do Chinese food right. And at lunch special prices, there's really no reason not to go at least once a week.  I'll go back again sometime this week and try more dishes but I'm pretty confident they'll still get 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Chinese Delivery.  I'm rarely disappointed with their American style Chinese food."}
{"text":"Meh--not even delivery can save you, China Sea.   But to be honest, since it's one of the only places that's close enough to deliver Chinese food and sushi (that should be your warning right there) we'll most likely continue to spend our money here on super-lazy days. Why not?   We ordered some rolls the other day and a large wonton soup for delivery. The soup was average, but good. The sushi was also just average, but way on the small side. I've seen some skimpy rolls in my time, but China Sea tops the charts. The fish seemed fresh, but I always stick with relatively \"safe bets\" when ordering from a semi-sketchy place. The spicy tuna was not very spicy, but not coated in too much mayo, either -- which I consider a plus. The California roll was just, well, OK and way small.   Like I said, not nearly the best, but if you're looking for Chinese or sushi delivery, this place will do the trick."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for lunch after reading the reviews.  Showed up at 11:00 and the place was not open yet...meanwhile two employees were sitting outside smoking cigarettes.  I asked and they said it would be open at 11:00 (it was 11:03), so I waited in my car until I got the all clear.  Was it worth the wait?  Maybe.  I decided to eat there so I could enjoy the General Tso's hot and fresh.  I ordered a combination plate, and the portion was plentiful.  As for the taste, the sauce was very good, but the white meat chicken was mostly breading.  Will try dark meat next time to see if it's mystery meat.  Egg roll was okay, but I've had better.  I can see why people love this place, but it didn't happen for me on this visit."}
{"text":"First time ordering here. Food was delivered quickly, was fresh, hot and very good! Delivery driver was friendly and pleasant. We will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I have had China Sea literally my entire life... almost 40 year of vivid recollection. I love this little dive! Some might believe that better quality dishes can be had elsewhere and in some cases they might be right, but China Sea is consistently good. More than good enough to keep me coming back even after having moved from the area, and good enough to stand the test of time.  My regular dishes are the BBQ spare ribs (long ribs), but you can get similar flavor without the bones with the sliced pork. Both delicious. The China Sea house rice is amazing and filled with chicken, pork, beef, sausage, and shrimp. One of the best dishes is the Cantonese chow mein. I also love the chicken egg foo yong and good ol' egg rolls. Their wonton soup isn't the best I've had so I might recommend passing on that.  In my travels I like to try little Chinese places here and there and China Sea is my benchmark and point of comparison. That's the kind of impact this place has had on me. Highly recommended, but certainly not for flash or dazzle! :)"}
{"text":"I'm probably not the best person to review a Chinese establishment considering that I get the same thing every time, and it's probably one of the most \"american\" things on the menu, however I can atleast comment on that.    A friend and I were looking for some lunch one Saturday afternoon in the Warehouse District and couldn't find much of anything that was quick and cheap as we had things to do.. so we settled on this.  I had Sweet and Sour Chicken and she had a California Roll.    The S+S Chicken was ok.. I've had better (Jumbo China on E55th) but the main issue for me was the large portion I had to purchase.  They don't have a small portion of S+S chicken, so i had to get a dinner sized one with Egg Roll and all.  BLAH.  Too much food for lunch.  The California Roll looked ok, I don't eat sushi so I can't comment on it really.   The Price was ok, nothing great, just average for places of this type."}
{"text":"Their food is great, and for the price they give you a lot. Also has fast delivery. I got the chicken fried rice with shrimp and it was amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It is a good delivery option for those who are living in Euclid.  Food is good, but not top level chinese. For Ohio it is alright. I wish they had some authentic Chinese dishes and not just the typical American-Chinese. I wish when you ordered spicy they would give you spicy.   Delivery drivers are polite and nice guys. The young middle school aged girl that answers the phone can be quite rude and argues with you. If she answers the phone I ask for the owner, I don't even order from her."}
{"text":"Food is average Chinese. Always choose to pickup the food when you can, they will say 45 min deliver time and show up an hour+ later."}
{"text":"Ate here only because we got half off through the Cleveland Daily Deals. Got the veggie maki option which was made in front of us, but small. Also got the general tso's made with tofu, which was acceptable. Still longing for a place that makes vegetarian TVP dishes.  If you have to eat it, I'd reccommend take out though, as the place is so crowded with random stuff you wouldn't want to find a restaurant, you feel like you're sitting in a pack rats living room."}
{"text":"double happiness? no - double dissapointment. no happy ending   I thought the time before last night was a fluke.  Nope.  Sucky food two times in a row.  Slimey egg foo yung, nasty hot&sour soup, and missing items in the delivery.  It will be a while, if ever again. Booooooooo.  Carry on."}
{"text":"Flew in from LA thinking there was no way Euclid/Cleveland would have a good Chinese food take out place and was wrong. This place was good! The eggs rolls were interesting not sure what was in them but I highly recommend this place if you are searching for GOOD affordable Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland on a saturday for an orchestra tour.  My friend and I wanted to explore and since our hotel was close by, we ventured this way.  At first we were going to Sushi Rock, but we walked in and the place was Completely Empty.  No customers, no wait staff, and rather creepy... also a tad expensive for college students.  So we wandered back the way we came and went to China Sea.  The place was cute, the place settings at the counter were especially awesome.  We browsed the sushi menu, since that was what we had a hankering for.  We ended up getting the Alaska roll, the Mexico roll, and the California Roll.  All were delicious and well priced.  The Mexico roll was my favorite.  We also got free soup, friend got soup with dumplings in it (forgot the name) and loved it and I tried the hot and sour soup, which was also delicious.  All in all it was a great excursion and time away from the hotel.  I'd recommend it to anyone, at least for the sushi."}
{"text":"I am from the san francisco bay area and out here visiting. The hot and sour soup is very good. Just as good as the Chinese place in Glen Park in San Francisco. I also ordered the Mapo tofu and definitely spicy. I taste a hint of sweetness which could be a sweet chili sauce versus non sweet. Not bad though. All very good. My nose is running. Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Ordered from here yesterday and I was not happy. I ordered the pepper steak with onion and it was not good! They packed the carton with so much steamed rice that there wasn't and gravy/sauce, it had more undone (crunchy af) peppers and onions than meat and it was bland as heck! I just took a few bites and trashed that garbage. I also ordered fried chicken which I didn't eat but HB said it was okay. I had this place before and it wasn't good but I tried to give it another try.. Never again I'll stick with China Mountain this place sucks."}
{"text":"This place is very close to my workplace and I get food from them quiet often. I really like online ordering option since I cant make personal calls from my work. Food is always ready on time. Shrimp fried rice is great!"}
{"text":"Update: 10/10/2016 I dropped my review from 5 stars to 3. Lately, they have been having over-breaded chicken. Once you bite through the piece of chicken in the wor su gai or sesame chicken, you see more breading than chicken and it can be felt while chewing. Also, the last order of sesame chicken has pieces of chicken that were a dark, almost grey-ish black color. Also, some of their egg rolls have been coming under fried with bad tasting cabbage. The last order I had was fine, but not so much with the others that come with our combo orders. I quit ordering the hibachi beef because I ordered it found what looked to be a fly or ant. They replaced it, but the replacement also had bugs. I figured it was the sauce they were using that was attracting bugs.  They are still friendly, their food still comes hot, but not as fresh as they used to be.    Original Review: 5/5/2015 This place doesn't disappoint. Their food is always hot and fresh. They pack the containers with food. They are very friendly. You can order online, but you have to call in to use a coupon.  The Wor su gai = good.  Sesame Chicken = great.  Wonton soup = really good.  Boneless ribs = great. Hibachi Beef = great.  Egg rolls = perfect.   We love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The chicken broccoli noodles was gross the sauce was super clumpy.. I should have went to the Hakka place next-door.. The food looks good from the pictures on the wall but sucks in reality."}
{"text":"As one of the few Chinese delivery restaurants, I have to give China Sea credit.  They are consistently good.  I wouldn't say that they are usually great - but they are always good.  You can count on calling in and your order arriving within 15-20 minutes hot and above average.    We've been brave enough to try their sushi on a few occasions, the Ohio Dream roll is actually quite good!  I've never been inside - so I can't say that I would go there to eat-in, but for delivery - it's okay in my book."}
{"text":"Wasn't a big fan of this place! The food was mediocre and the service was not good at all! There are plenty of other Chinese places that will offer you a better experience."}
{"text":"Typical taste you would expect from a takeout Chinese resturaunt.  The food is cheap but taste good.  It is good to have a trditional Chinese resteruant amongst all the hakka options"}
{"text":"One of the \"Top Two\" best Chinese restaurants I've eaten from! The sesame chicken was on point, and the orange chicken w/ Ham fried rice and shrimp egg rolls seemed to please my boys very much. They ate more than I expected, and had seconds even my 'picky eater' wanted more so that's a plus!   Delivery was fast, and I read another review that said you would have to order online if you wanted delivery...... well not me I called and ordered. We will most certainly be eating from here again, we were very impressed, satisfied, and had full bellies  going to bed.. \"Two Thumbs Up\"!!!!"}
{"text":"One of those hidden gems in the heart of Malton, I've been coming here for \"Canadian\" Chinese food for at least 2 decades.  It's my go to spot for post softball eats, and I always get the combo 4 (Chicken balls, Fried Rice and eggroll).  Food is always fresh out of the fryer and service is very quick.  Owners are friendly and the prices cannot be beat.  It's really a takeout store front with minimal seating, not very glamours but the food is exactly what you need when craving fast food style chinese food."}
{"text":"Always fresh the people are polite and they always give us something extra with our delivery order they have the best lo main in Cleveland not to many vegetables just right and they give you plenty of food for the price they are worth trying if you have not eaten there before."}
