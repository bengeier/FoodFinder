Après je dois dire que leur jus d'orange pressé et les portions ne sont vraiment pas copieuse même avec le fameux \" massif\". Un autre bémol sur le service qui est vraiment à revoir. La serveuse est suiteuse était perdues .... 15 minutes pour recevoir nos cafés après que nos plats soient sur tables."}

{"text":"What a great place for Sunday brunch!  We had excellent food, excellent coffee (I'm fussy about my lattes), and wonderful servers.   My husband had the Belle Province waffle (yummy!) and I had the Supreme Benedictine (delicious and creative!).  All of the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly, to a person.  When we mentioned to our server that we'd discovered the restaurant through Yelp, he told the owner, and the owner came over and chatted with us for a while.  Well, we're sold!  We'll be back for sure.  Wonderful hospitality, great food, and a funky setting....Who could ask for more?  Yelp has steered us right, again!"}
{"text":"La nourriture y est bonne mais 1h30 d'attente entre la commande et le service font que je n'y retournerai probablement pas."}
{"text":"I love this place! The first time I went, my parents were in town visiting and they wanted brunch. I had read good reviews about this restaurant on yelp, so we decided to try it. Unfortunately, there was about a 30 minute wait with a line out the door. We decided to stay and try it out since we were already there, even though my dad hates waiting more than 10 minutes at restaurants. The wait staff was very apologetic about the wait (unnecessarily...their food is just too good!) and polite. My dad ordered the chicken and waffles, which turned out to be incredibly delicious, but so much food that we couldn't even help him finish it! My mom and I ordered ham and cheese crepes, which were very good. My husband ordered the special that day, which was a mac n cheese benny. This is where they really hit the nail on the head. They form mac n cheese into cubes, fry them up, and cover them in an egg and hollandaise sauce. I have been back to this restaurant five times since and have tried omelettes, regular bacon and eggs, chicken and waffles, the massive, and huevos locos and I've never been disappointed by anything I've ordered. However, my favorite thing on the menu has definitely been mac n cheese benny. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, too. My advice--if there's a line, Faberge is absolutely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best for brunch with friends. The staff is super friendly, the food is fantastic, and the coffee is great. The first time I went here they also had latte art in my foam and it made my day. :) this is hands down my go to brunch place and it's worth the wait if you have to wait (usually packed on the weekends)."}
{"text":"The food is good, but service very slow.  It took an hour for our food to arrive.  When I asked about our order the waitress said the kitchen was backed up.  She made it sound like we should have known it was going to take a long time to get our food.  Extremely rude."}
{"text":"This is our go-to brunch place in the neighbourhood.

The food is good, the portions are generous for the price, the drinks are delicious, and the atmosphere is friendly and casual.

Unlike many of the other brunch places in the area, Faberge isn't pretentious. The menu is large and can accommodate many different kinds of dietary restrictions-- our group has, in the past, included someone who cannot eat dairy, someone who cannot eat gluten, a vegetarian, someone who cannot eat cilantro and someone with a severe peanut allergy. All found something tasty to eat without too many substitutions. They're also happy to accommodate large groups. Fifteen of us walked in on a busy Saturday morning without a reservation, and we were quickly and painlessly seated.

There are some misses on the menu. The combination of the hollandaise sauce with the sauteed vegetables on the breakfast poutine leaves it too sweet, with the chicken in the chicken and waffles was on the tough side. On the other hand, The Big Cheese sandwich (get it with chicken!), the breakfast burrito, and the huevos rancheros were all spot-on. The house caesar, made with tomatillos, goes down easy, too. There are enough successes on the menu to keep Faberge its five stars.

We've sometimes had issues sorting out our bills at the end of a meal, but this has only happened when we've been a large group, and our server has always worked hard to sort out the issues. 

For putting up with a big rowdy group, for some delicious menu items, and for an atmosphere that doesn't feel unbearably prententious, Faberge remains my favourite place to get brunch in Mile End."}
{"text":"My ex-wife took me here to tell me she was leaving me for another man. They had free coffee in line. Breakfast came with fruit I didn't order."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique brunch! Benny Mac was incredible."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant with attentive staff.  

We went there for brunch based on the suggestion of a local foodie.  By the time we arrived the line up was out the door.

There were five of us and all  food sampled  was excellent. The portion was large enough to share although we polished every plate. One of the highlights was the breakfast poutine that even the picky 9 year old nephew enjoyed with a smile."}
{"text":"Of all the places in Mile-End, this is the place where I always tip the staff extra. 

The food is good, it arrives on time, hearty portions (if you're starving) and the staff are always ridiculously upbeat. I have often returned here for lunch and every staff member has always been top notch. These people genuinely care for your experience. 

Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"Had a pleasant and sunny brunch on the cute terrace , shared a perfect Classic Benedict with husband. Everything is super fresh, made well and timely - the coffee is VERY good. Staff is sweet and naturally friendly which is much needed in the morning :) The inside decor is well done too. Super good vibes - hope to return !"}
{"text":"Great brunch place! Good variety of sweet and salty options. Service is friendly and efficient. The lineup is well worth it."}
{"text":"Un des brunchs dont on entend le plus parler; une longue file d'attente pour découvrir plusieurs tables libres à l'intérieur - on a l'impression d'être témoins de la meme technique des boites de nuit qui veulent donner l'impression que c'est bondé en faisant patienter les gens à la porte. 

Le service est bien, les serveurs anglais se forcent pour servir en français et vice versa.

Nous avons prit les oeufs benedicte sur mac and cheese avec pulled pork, les oeufs benedictine aux champignons, la poutine dejeuner, et le sandwich dejeuner El Jefe. 
Le plat d'oeuf était à la fois sans goût, à la fois trop épicé et les textures n'étaient pas au point. Les patates étaient excellente par contre. La poutine déjeuner était passable, par contre les poivrons prennent le dessus sur tout le reste. Le sandwich déjeuner était tout une déception, et clairement une erreur d'un cuisinier sans passion. Le pain était completement brulé à l'intérieur, le jaune d'oeuf trainait au fond de l'assiette, une demi-tranche de tomate servait de croquant et il y avait à peine de mayonnaise.

Finalement, nous avons attendu 30-40 minutes et 8 serveurs à esquiver notre table pour se faire débarasser et avoir l'addition."}
{"text":"Served eight of us for brunch and each dish looked delicious. Waffles were deadly. Cappuccino was dandy. Very excellent service. Fast and friendly. Me likey."}
{"text":"Food: Large selections of different varieties of typical brunch items and some not so common items like chicken and waffle. The food was hot when it came (which is always a plus), everyone was happy about their selection and the taste was good.

Service: Good for large groups, we went for a birthday party with a group of 10+ people and they were able to accommodate us (we did have a reservation). Food came out pretty fast and staff is pretty attentive and efficient.

Value: A little steep for the portions.

Ambiance: Trendy vintage-ish ambiance with large windows which baths the whole place in warm sunlight in the morning. Seats are very spaced. Expect lineup over the weekends if you come too late."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the homemade jam and the fresh squeezed juice (and that last one was even free, thanks to a Yelp! check in)."}
{"text":"So this is my second trip into Montreal. By chance we were crazing around the Mile End and came upon this interesting establishment. Boy oh boy did we luck out. This place is AWSOME!  The service outstanding and the owners a pleasure to meet. 

You have to go here for Breakfast/Brunch on the weekend and lunch is great as well. Food is well prepared and you cannot go wrong with the Breakfast Poutine as you will be full and not disappointed. So do yourself a favor get off the beaten path and eat like a local prince at Faberge and enjoy the pleasurable experience of local dining offered by Echo and her team!!"}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés à ce restaurant plusieurs fois pour bruncher et lors de notre plus récente, et dernière, visite, nous avons été franchement déçus.

Nous étions arrivés assez tôt le matin et le restaurant etait presque vide donc le service aurait dû être hors pair. 

Voici la liste des erreurs qui sont arrivées lors de notre visite:
- mon plat m'a été apporté 15 minutes avant celui de ma copine.
- mon sandwich etait complètement différent de celui que j'avais commandé: omission de la guacamole, du bacon et de la mayo épicée, ajout de laitue et de tomates: bref, c'était un tout autre sandwich.
-dans l'assiette de ma copine, le pain doré qui était supposé être enrobé d'une croûte Graham pralinée et couronné d'une confiture de fraise n'était en fait que saupoudré de cannelle et couvert d'une triste sauce aux fraises; aucune trace de cette fameuse croûte Graham :(

Notre serveur semblait empathique à la situation mais plutôt que d'essayer de compenser pour les gaffes de la cuisine, il nous évitait.

Nous les éviterons aussi à l'avenir."}
{"text":"Walked an hour just to eat here and it was sooo worth it! Most amazing brunch and awesome service! The hardest part was choosing just one thing from the menu."}
{"text":"SUPER FRIENDLY staff!  The hostess was so upbeat and positive even though it was crazy busy and a difficult situation to manage. 

Food choices were AMAZING! I couldn't decide what to get. They had a special: Mac and Cheese Benedict. I was sold. When it came out it exceeded expectations. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I came to the Fabergé during brunch time on a freezing winter day. To warm myself I started with a matcha latte. The service was very fast although the restaurant was half full and for 5$ the latte came in a huge cup. Unfortunately, the cup was half filled with cream. The presentation was nice but both the matcha and the latte were lacking in flavour.

I went on to order the waffle and chicken which was recommended to me as their specialty. It came with a small salad, a small portion of fruits, some potatoes, some maple syrup and some tomato sauce. For 15$ it was a bit pricey but you get what you paid for. The fried chicken pieces were huge but well cooked and very tasty. I couldn't finish my plate even after sharing a few pieces. The waffles were less impressive but with some maple syrup they were just as delicious.

Overall the friendly staff and the beautifully painted walls and ceiling made for a very positive experience. Next time (because there'll definitely be a next time) I'll need to remember to order a smaller plate. 4/5"}
{"text":"I really like the decor of this place. I was there with some friends in the morning, being the complete opposite of a morning person, walking into this place on Fairmount is a nice wake-up call.

I don't have a sweet tooth, so I ordered a ham & cheese crepe. I expected the crepe wrapping the ham and cheese to be savoury, but it wasn't. So it resulted in a very weird sweet and savoury crepe. But my friends who ordered the strawberry crepe, and chicken waffles seem to have a good time. All in all though, for crepes, I've definitely had better ones elsewhere. But the service was nice, and the decor was so cute that it's definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Ended up here by mistake as Sparrow doesn't open until 10am for breakfast. We crossed our fingers that perhaps it might be a little gem find and it was. Not overly expensive, super enjoyed my breakfast sandwich. Latte was great and the fresh juice (free with check-in) is always a great treat. Service was great though there does seem to be lots of staff moving about. I hope that they have a rush to account for the staff numbers."}
{"text":"Stopped by this brunch spot on a rainy summer morning in Montreal and thought it was a nice way to spend the last morning of a wonderful trip. There was a line when we arrived, but it moved pretty quickly. Ordered the Smokey (poached eggs with salmon and cream cheese) and a waffle with real Canadian Maple syrup on the side. Definitely over ordered but was looking to indulge, so it was well worth it. The service was friendly and overall thought this spot was well worth it. Only reason for 3 stars vs 4 is because while this place was tasty, there wasn't anything particularly unique about the menu or ambiance relative to other excellent brunch spots."}
{"text":"40 minutes d'attente pour avoir une place, et un lieu plus que bruyant. Le rapport qualité prix est correct, mais rien d'exceptionnel, on peut retrouver les plats dans des lieux plus sympas. L'assiette commandée n'était pas complète par rapport au menu."}
{"text":"We arrived a relatively large group (7 of us) for breakfast around 10:45 a Saturday morning for brunch. It was obviously a busy time, and with so many of us, we had to wait outside for about an hour and fifteen minutes before being seated. We were lucky though because it was a gorgeous day outside - this is not something I'd want to be doing in the dead of winter!

The drinks menu looked exquisite. I ordered a regular iced latte (because it was quite hot in the restaurant!), but the other lattes and cappuccinos looked fabulous *see pic*. The bloody mary was also really good! I was literally envious of everyone who got a mimosa, but I just really needed coffee too badly. 

The food was also really delicious. I got Le Fume. Which was tasty. The salmon could have had a more smoky flavor and I think the mini bagels were just a tad too hard (could barely cut them!), but the potatoes and fruit were good. Le classique looked a little bit better in terms of \"cut-ability\", which is probably what I would get the next time. All the other dishes looked good too, the crepes and the waffles look amazing... To think of trying those the next time.

Overall, we were pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast at a decent price. Love the ambiance and the decoration! Great place to go brunch with friends. You get a free coffee with your yelp \"Check in\"."}
{"text":"Super yummy place - went for breakfast and had the poutine matinale. Everything was so good, including the coffee and the free smoothie. Was there on a Saturday morning and didn't have to wait at all. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant via Yelp and went for hangover brunch. I am a big fan of eggs benedict and I have to say that the \"rustic\" was possibly the best benedict i've ever had. A bit expensive but well worth it."}
{"text":"The decor is real nice, ecclectic and kinda hipster. You have regular tables, booths and banquettes living room style seating. 

The menu is extensive, and has everything. from straight up eggs and bacon to eggs benedicts to crepes and even breakfast poutine.

The eggs were cooked perfectly, my benedicts were nice and round and well poached. The sunny side ups we ordered also came out perfect, yolks all shiny and bright. the fries were very good too. The sausages were not good, it tasted weird, and the hollandaise sauce was bland, but the st-paulin cheese is excellent it only we were given a bit more of it to balance out the hollandaise sauce it would be better. If you're going to order eggs benedict go with the ham one, at least the ham is salty so it will balance better.

French toast was very soft and nice. All i all, a fine place, but it gets quite loud when it's packed. A bit pricey but all brunch places are pricey now, what is going on? 

I'd come back for the french toast and try the pulled pork sandwich :)"}
{"text":"Super cute brunch spot. I had a mushroom eggs benny which was great along with a free latte which I got using the check in. Was pleasantly surprised that drip coffee is always free! Such a nice touch. They also have tvs playing Sunday cartoons which I thoroughly enjoyed. Great service, great food and great coffee."}
{"text":"We waited about 30 minutes but it was worth it because both the service and food were great. Big thanks to George and Kat, our server who really went the extra mile to serve the food to our big group promptly and paid attention to our requests. Chicken and waffles were as expected and perfectly crispy and the dipping sauce was excellent! Lassis were refreshing too with the hints of saffron. Would definitely go again when we visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"Traveled here for breakfast with a group of students and we were not disappointed.  The breakfast poutine, with hollandaise as the gravy, was an absurd dish.  It was probably the best and most creative breakfast I've had in the past year.  A friend got the Chicken & Waffles, that was pretty indulgent as well.  The service was warm and wonderful and everyone left happy and full.  Can't wait to return on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Fabregé, but I really can't.

While the location of the restaurant is great (on super cute Fairmount), and the design of the place is fantastic, everything else leaves something to be desired.

The last time I was there, there was a 30 minute wait to be seated, which wasn't an issue considering we were a group of three. The problem started when it took another 15 minutes to take our order upon being seated, and another 45 to get any food at all. This is entirely unacceptable, especially when the waitress completely ignored us when we asked for more drinks to tide over our hunger.

Upon receiving our order (eggs benny, crepes and omlettes) the breads were both soggy, and the omelette was runny on one side. I can highly recommend the smoothies but that's about it.

I can't say I'll ever want to return - they need to really step up their service."}
{"text":"Good but overrated and too crowded...
It's raining outside, there's a line, 20 minutes  wait to get in but that's fine.
I had the eggs in a nest. It was very good but hey it's eggs and bread, not much can go wrong here.  My friends had the poutine, the omelet and blueberry waffle. I'd say the waffle was what actually worth the most praises. Everything was good but nothing was mind blowing. This place is like the tutti frutti of the mile end."}
{"text":"Ok, I went to this place three times and on all three occasions I found the food and service underwhelming. 

On my first visit I got eggs benny - looked like your standard benedict, the eggs were great, but the potatoes were undercooked and the fruit cup was pathetic for the price. The waitress offered orange juice, failed to mention it was 5$ (was the worst orange juice i've ever had ) you can get you a lot more for better quality La Vielle St Laurent ia a prime example

On my second visit I got an omelet...it was sloppy, I should have sent it back but I've never been one to send food back and have worked in plenty of restaurants.The potatoes!!! I didn't order burnt potatoes with indian spices...I thought I ordered breakfast potatoes? The fruit cup was also sad. 

On my third and final visit I ordered a club sandwich...sadly this plate was super overpriced though it looked nice. It just wasn't great. There was a lot of meat on the sandwich, but it was all just \"blah.\"  

To sum it up, in my opinion, this place is inconsistent and uninspired..It's just breakfast..I felt stupid every time I had to pay there...:(  So many more places with better prices and knock-out brunches in Montreal) I will never go there again and will make sure my friends know. This place is for dumb kids who don't know anything about food also powdered grave really!!!????"}
{"text":"Very cool little place tucked away on Fairmont near Clarke. When you get inside there's a royal purple and black/white theme that plays off the name, and the patrons are all ages but biased a bit towards the faux-hipsters in the Mile End. 

The food is excellent - huge plates and very reasonably priced. Other than that, not much to say - good service, friendly people, and very casual. Worth it."}
{"text":"It was really easy for two of us to get in on a Tuesday morning. They had a great, bright interior. I had a nice cappuccino and the moinsieur jambon was delicious. It was more than enough food. The menu was provided in English and French. The waitress was also very nice."}
{"text":"Great vibe, amazing service, reasonable prices, and excellent food. 
The staff really makes you feel welcome, very friendly.

I shared the breakfast poutine and the waffles with chicken. Both were great. I personally liked the breakfast poutine a bit more.

I'm pretty picky about my go-to breakfast places, but now this is on the list. I will definitely go back again and again. 

On a side note, when we checked-in on Yelp, we all got a free non-alcoholic drink. But the staff was so nice that they upgraded the drink to free freshly squeezed blood-orange mimosas!"}
{"text":"When you enter the restaurant, the dining space is a little misleading.  I was thinking that there wasn't much room.  That's when we took a right into the adjoining room to see that there was a great deal of space.  From where I was sitting, I actually had a great view of the kitchen, though I was too low to really see inside.  All I could really see where top halves of cooks diligently preparing food.

The service was actually quite exceptional.  As just mentioned, we were greatly taken care of the entire time.  I find it rare to have servers who are able to play along with the more eccentric members of groups.  In this case, the server was able to exchange a few good lines with our beloved special member of our group.  For me, that's the added touch that you don't find so much in places.  Too many times, you'll see servers who are tired and let it affect their smile.  I realize it's a very tough job that is mostly thankless, which is why the ones who still have that charisma really impress me.

The main strength behind Fabergé is their generously vast breakfast menu.  From what I was able to see with my eyes, they do take great care in presenting their brunch plates.  What makes an hour or two comfortable here is the level of care shown by the staff.  You won't feel little at all, as your server will take good care of you.  While Fabergé is almost near the end of its second year of operation, I'm really hoping that it becomes part of the fabric that is known as the Mile-End."}
{"text":"Our favorite brunch place in Montreal! It's always worth the wait! The Benny Mac is the stuff dreams are made of!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Restaurant. Very popular. They show 90s cartoons on Tv for brunch. Almost too popular now however. If you are going for brunch on a weekend after noon, expect to line up outside and wait. 

Positives: since we were only a group of 2 we waited like 5 minutes max. Service was quick and really good. Everything we needed and more. 

Negative: it's easy to tell that the kitchen is struggling to maintain the quality of food while keeping up with demand. We didn't wait too long for the food despite how busy it was, but my waffles were soggy (probably premade and left in a pile of waffles to be served) and my fried chicken was so hard to chew or cut probably because it was fried once, left out, then fried again. This was a serious offence to me because I friggen love waffles, and fried chicken. So that was a soggy experience. 

We will probably go again but go early if it's the weekend!"}
{"text":"We went on a sunny Friday around noon so there was a small line-up. I had heard about their chicken waffle so we ordered some. But it didn't exceed the expectations: the chicken was crunchy, but it didn't taste anything special. The waffles were just plain. The sauce did match the chicken though. Overall, the plate wasn't a \"wow\". We also ordered the fumé (egg benedictine) with smoked salmon and bagels. It was again so-so... Since our wait for the food was pretty long, our overall experience was not as enjoyable."}
{"text":"Exceptional place for brunch - probably my favorite brunch spot in Montreal! We were seated on the small outside patio, which was like a small enclosure surrounding by a bright coloured fence & flowers. The only thing was that they don't serve alcohol out there, so if you want a mimosa opt to sit inside. We wanted to try absolutely everything on the menu and it was so difficult to choose what to get! We finally chose the Chicken and Waffles, with a side of breakfast poutine & the mac and cheese benny with a side of regular poutine. It was delicious. It satisfied our brunch craving for something rich and comforting, but was cooked perfectly - it was not too oily, the flavours were well balanced, overall amazing quality."}
{"text":"Very cute little restaurant in Montreal! We came here with a friend for brunch and sat at a table in their little garden behind the restaurant. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my husband ordered their specialty \"Breakfast Poutine\"! The portions were huge and a lot of their veggies are grown in their little garden :) We loved the ambiance of the restaurant, the staff, amazing food and were very happy that our friend introduced us to this really cute place!"}
{"text":"We booster this spot as we were visiting from the States. The food was delicious!
Would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken and waffles are to DIE FOR. Get them with the mac n cheese croquettes and spicy mayo."}
{"text":"I had the Alouette omelette and it was delicious. Small portions and slightly upscale prices. The ambiance is nice but overall the place felt a little pretentious to me---maybe it's because I was solo. If you are in the neighbourhood on a weekend and there's a lineup, there are plenty of alternatives nearby that are (nearly) as good food-wise and maybe more comfortable ambiance-wise. 

Also if you like to laptop over breakfast, they don't have it."}
{"text":"fabrege  gave me sum maynoaize 4 my homefry and i took it hom and it was good 2 eat lter  but then i ate it and left it on the floor and my big toe got mayoniaise on it :S  just a lil confused :S"}
{"text":"An obviously popular brunch spot - and for good reason. Service, menu selection, quality of food was above-par from your usual breakfast spots (definitely beating out Cora's - which I love!). I had the chicken and waffles signature dish - totally OTT for a breakfast selection, but was not disappointed. Chicken was succulent, tasty and fresh - KFC et al, take note. Nice side of fruit to round things off. Portion size was too large for me - but not a complaint on my side. My friend had the smokey eggs benedict which was made to perfection - the smoked salmon was very nice. I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I was with Erik V. and a friend of his visiting from Ottawa who is always blown away that you can just walk down the street and have endless delicious and vibing eateries at your fingertips.  

We were going to go to L'avenue, but there was 50 people in line, so I suggested we try Faberge as I'd heard pretty good things about it.  

I was very excited to walk in on a Saturday around 1pm and see there was no lineup but the place was bustling and the vibe was warm and lively.  We were seated in an awesome raised booth and the staff was just delightful!  I don't think I've been treated so well ever.  Super classy staff!

I shared with erik v the breakfast poutine which we added sausage onto and the fried chicken waffle.  Both were tasty indulgent treats.  Throw a Caesar on top and what a fantastic boozy brunch it was! They also have delightful fresh squeezed mimosas.

Can't wait to check out the terrace in the summer."}
{"text":"Service rapide et sympathique. Belle assiettes copieuses. J'avais des morceaux de coquilles dans mes oeufs brouillés.
*Suite à mon avis, la propriétaire m'a contacté, pour m'offrir un nouveau déjeuner. Il ont leur clientèle à coeur; c'est un excellent signe."}
{"text":"Vous pouvez y aller seul, en couple, entre amis ou encore en famille.  Les enfants sont les bienvenue. J'ai adoré le concept déco un peu futuriste auquel on mélange une touche de comédie. Il ya des écrans télé qui jouent des déssins animés toute la journée. Dans un cadre lounge et chalereux, tout est en oeuvre pour votre confort. Le vaste menu de crèpes saura satisfaire aux appétits les plus gourmands."}
{"text":"Je ne comprends pas que les gens puissent faire la file pour ca. Tous nos repas étaient froids, même les patates. 80$ pour 2 adultes et 2 enfants et ce fut le pire déjeuner que nous avons eu à vie. Les gaufres étaient bonnes par-contre."}
{"text":"busy, but good food. loats a kids and young families. There are huge TVs everywhere so it is a bit distracting. There is normally a bit of a line up for brunch on the wknds but the servers are nice and the food comes fast."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles was simply amazing. Really nice place, cute decor. My husband took the \"Expos\" omelette and he said they probably were the best eggs he ever had! The coffee is a little bit too strong ( tasted bitter) and the service was not the fastest. But it was great considering we were not in a rush. Bathrooms needs a little TLC. We'll go back for the food for sure."}
{"text":"A must try breakfast place in Outremont! I have been here only a few times but I haven't been disappointed yet. Their plates are really delicious and their coffee is REALLY good!!! I heard they often spice up their menu which is pretty cool. If you can go on a week day it's ideal, week-end line ups might be crazy and discouraging, but once seated, the service is quite fast! We can't have it all :P  

Tip: While your there, make a quick stop at Fairmount or St-Viateur to get yourself some fresh bagels for la casa ;)

Pro's:
- Funky/Hip setting 
- Super friendly staff
- Out of the box Breakfast menu options!
- Crazy milkshake (Haven't tried but check their Instagram, this makes me think it's maybe time I give it a shot!) 

Con's:
- No reservations but I understand it would be hectic managing this
- Line-ups which is out of their control since service is fast"}
{"text":"Another highly overrated, overcrowded, over priced  restaurant. 
Even at the off-peak time we showed up, we still had to wait 20 minutes for a seat.  Don't expect any pleasant  waiting area. You'll be standing out on the street, dodging baby carriages and skateboarders. When you finally are seated, you'll be packed in like sardines, in the hot, sticky, loud dining area where you will then choose from an overpriced menu. 
The food was fine. Nothing spectacular. Portions are average. For the price/value to taste ratio, I just simply don't get the hype. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles, which he liked. I ordered eggs and toast and while it was good, it was no better than any other decent place."}
{"text":"Dommage... Plein de promesses mais le service, débordé, était très lent (1h d'attente une fois installés) et distrait (le pain n'est jamais arrivé). Cadre sympa mais attention pas de climatisation donc l'endroit devient vite un sauna. A éviter quand la température est trop élevée. Plats bien servis et bons produits. Eviter les oeufs brouillés si vous les aimez baveux, ils étaient vraiment trop cuits à mon goût malgré ma demande. Le crunchy yaourt manquait cruellement de granola. Pommes de terre délicieuses et signature poutine top. A re-tester quand il fera moins chaud et avec moins de monde. Entre 10 et 15 dollars le plat."}
{"text":"Fabergé NEVER disappoints!

WAIT TIME: be prepared to wait. There's usually a line-up but I've never had to wait too long. The place is big with plenty of seating options and tables of 2 are seated fairly quickly. They do have a rule that your entire party must be present before you are seated so plan accordingly!

SERVICE: Friendly, smiling hostess and knowledgeable, friendly staff. Plates are brought and cleared quickly. 

AMBIANCE: Probably my favorite part! Place is big and airy with lots of different seating options. Interesting art on the walls and vintage cartoons on their TV screens (is there anything better than 80's Transformers?) The crowd is eclectic - hipsters, families, couples.

FOOD: lots of delicious and interesting choices. Chicken and waffles are delicious as is the breakfast burrito and my brother swears by the breakfast poutine. Coffee is fresh and refilled often and freshly squeezed juices and smoothies are good."}
{"text":"Love this place - very cosy, great vibe and the staff are the nicest around.  The waitress was so sweet and even gave us tips on where to visit while in Montreal.  
The food was delicious.- great place for a brunch.  HUGE I mean HUGE portions.  Potatoes were  especially delicious.  Delicious crepes with  nutella.  This place gets very busy and we came here on a Friday morning......but I think its always like that."}
{"text":"Fun decor, friendly service - very easy-going - had the Benny Mac and the Chicken and Waffles - we were told they were the signature dishes, and they were both great - 

Cute neighborhood, too."}
{"text":"Have to admit food was just mediocre. We ordered what seemed to be the favourites of chicken and waffle and Mac and cheese eggs benny. The jalapeño Mac and cheese and sauce was more of a sweet and spicy taste and the Mac and cheese patty as bread was extremely dense. A bit too sweet and savoury for me as a breakfast dish compared to regular eggs benny. 

They gave a free mini smoothie in place of the sparkling soda check in though as they ran out."}
{"text":"I really enjoy brunch so maybe I'm a bit biased off the bat but I found Faberge a charming little restaurant in Montreal for a brunch. I went on Thursday morning so there wasn't a line for me but I know this place is notorious for long weekend brunch lineups. There was no seating on the patio available but the interior is extremely cute and well decorated. I found there to be ample natural lighting which makes me very happy. 

I ordered the Bonhomme crepe which was a traditional crepe filled with apples and cheese. Sounds like a gross combo? No, it was heavenly. 

I think the classic breakfasts are nothing special but try some of their more adventerous options and I think you will be pleasantly surprised. 

Pros 
-cute interior
- good flavors

Cons
- can be a long wait"}
{"text":"Great brunch, great atmosphere, great staff. Our toddler was kept entertained by the Bugs Bunny cartoons playing on the two big screens. Pancakes were fluffy; so were the eggs. Probably would have preferred to be asked whether I wanted my croissant sliced and toasted (I didn't), but that's a minor quibble. Definitely worth your time for a good brunch in Mile End."}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch spot but get here before 11am! 

Breakfast poutine was good but very heavy and rich, croque Monsieur was delicious! Great hash browns and many gluten free options"}
{"text":"Visited Montreal for the weekend with a large group (9) and went here on a Sunday based off a friends recommendation. While I was skeptical that a group our size could fit, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. While it took a bit longer to get seated, I appreciated the extra effort. Note that there will be a wait time - big or small to enter. Glad we took the extra wait though because the food was definitely worth it. I had a hard time deciding what to get since everything sounded good but I got the Sante Eggs Benedict and tried the side poutine. It was awesome! Definitely held up to my brunch standards and kicked off my day right."}
{"text":"Five stars for food and really nice staff, one star off for slightly crazy decor and noise level. I couldn' t really hear my partner but I loved my brunch! Shakshuka--spicy, filling, really good. Was also happy to only wait in line for about 20 minutes on a Saturday at 11 AM. I'm from Boston and that's unheard of for brunch, especially a destination brunch spot like this. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I returned to Fabergé for the second time with two friends on a Sunday morning. Having stopped eating gluten, I was excited to see that the menu indicated which options are gluten free. I opted for the Huevos Dorados without the rice. For a $16 brunch, I thought that this would be a large serving, however both of the eggs came on one little tortilla, dressed with the described toppings. Very disappointing. I did order this without the rice however even if the rice had been on the place I would have been disappointed. Huge ripoff. 

Filter coffee is good."}
{"text":"this is my third time at the restaurant and it never fails to please. The service is impeccable. all who work there are really friendly.

I had le massif, which was amazing! the french toast was GREAT! I was full until dinner!

I have to say, though, I wish I had ordered their newest item on the menu, that my two friends had, which I tasted and was SOOOOO GOOD! It's the breakfast poutine!

I have to go back and have that!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast we found on Montreal. Home Fries are Amazing, Benedict was Outstanding. Great atmosphere, paintings on the walls and art everywhere."}
{"text":"Service super cool endroit super sympa pour manger il vaut mieux arriver tot car assez occupé sinon vraiment cool"}
{"text":"We arrived at 10:30 AM on a beautiful Sunday morning, The line extended outdoors  and we were prepared for a wait. Within minutes we were summoned to a table for four that had just become available. Great start! Menus and wait staff in English! Service prompt, warm and attentive. Food really good - not necessarily better than many of other brunch locations, but with all the other positive features, I would definitely recommend and return. The potatoes are outstanding.  I would have awarded 5 stars but I have one complaint. The hollandaise sauce which is served on all their Bennys could use a tweeking in flavour - it's lacking the expected tang."}
{"text":"Great brunch Saturday morning.  Arrived around 8:30 am without a wait.  Everyone great d us kindly and spoke english well! Food was great! Coffee great too, try the Americano!  It would be a 5 star rating if the restaurant was cooler- it was very hot in there!"}
{"text":"Used to be pretty good, recent menu changes have resulted in a really, really lack lustre experience.

Ordered the Huevos Dorados, and was so completely underwhelmed both by the quality and by the portion. Given the premium pricing, better quality was expected. (it wasn't good, at any price)

Service has always been spotty. They were busy, but there were tables still empty. Took us 10 minutes to get coffee on the table after sitting. 

Far too many better breakfast options to recommend this one."}
{"text":"L'endroit est très connu, mais l'ambiance en vaut le détour. Leur spécialité des oeufs bénédictines avec du macaroni au fromage est hallucinant. Gras, goutteux et savoureux. Seul bémol serait le bruit agressant quand tout le monde arrive a 12h ! Mais, j'y retournerais sans problème"}
{"text":"I love love love love this place.

Give yourself some good ol brunch! The menu is ultra simple, the staff is super friendly , the decor is alright but who cares when you got old school cartoons playing on the tv and the food is AWESOME! If I could change one thing it would be the line up outside, I mean , it be cold out there sometimes ya know! 

I'm losing count on how many time I be at this spot!

Everything is good!"}
{"text":"It was a 20 minute wait and worth every minute. The buzz in the place is electric and lots of people of all ages.

The service is friendly and attentive. Everything arrived at the right time. Last night's residual effects banished by cool delicious Vert smoothie. 

Val's latte was not only perfect but beautiful.

Eggs Bennie Rustic for me. EB Supreme for Val. Absolutely perfectly prepared in both cases.

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Check in for a free smoothie!! Was completely packed and had to wait in line, went fairly quickly before we got seated though. Had to wait even longer while seated before our brunch came, drinks came right away though. 

$17 - Chicken waffle (recommend). On the pricier end but very large portions. Came with slices of orange pineapple and watermelon. Worth the price for the amount of food over the other plates.

$16 - Rustique Benedict. Well flavoured and seasoned. Runny eggs that was well done. 

$14 - Alouette Omlette. Pretty big piece of omlete but a bit plain, pretty common and nothing surprising.

Great service, friendly staff and quite cozy. Was fairly excited when I first arrived but the wait definitely turned me off a bit."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing food - had the huevos rancheros and replaced the regular fries with poutine which was to die for - we waited 30 minutes  from order to food arriving to our table which is totally acceptable for a NYC inhabitant !"}
{"text":"As one of the best noted breakfast places in Montreal, Fabergé was on my list to try for awhile now. Its a lovely place with cute deco and very comfy and large bench type chairs . They offer basic breakfast\brunch\lunch type foods. A selection of crepes, poach eggs, omelettes and sandwiches. I had an omelette with spinach, mushroom and swiss cheese that was mmmhhh ! With that came a little bowl of fruit, some bread toast and sauteed potatoes. I must say it was pretty good & very satisfying, i had a hard time finishing my meal ! The potatoes in my opinion are one of the most delicious items and the friends i went with agreed. Since Fabergé is known for their breakfast poutine, two of my friends ordered those, it looked pretty decadent and a must try for when you are starving !

Good service, Good food and charming place!

All in all its a good place for brunch, i won't necessarily run back there but if i'm around Mont royal/Laurier neighbourhood i might stop by !"}
{"text":"Lovely decor.  Delicious, decadent breakfast.  And amazing, huge cafe latte bowls.  Service was friendly and helpful.  Prices were reasonable.  I will definitely dine here again when I'm back in Montreal."}
{"text":"Excruciatingly slow service on Sunday's at high noon but extremely yummy when you're finally seated. Orange juice is divine crepes are good and fruit salad was varied. Would come again on a weekday most likely."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Meh. 
We got the classic eggs and rancheros. 
Not the most flavorful, bacon not great quality. 
They were out of queso, didn't tell me or put another cheese on.  Waitress didn't check on us. 
Pop music way too loud."}
{"text":"J'ai été mangé au Fabergé a l'occasion de la soirée Élite ' sans dessus dessous'.

Ce qu'on nous a servi était succulent : un genre de sloppy joe dans un pain kaiser, avec fromage a la crème et piments forts servi avec frites épicées et mayo maison. Ça a fait un bon petit fond, puisque nous buvions du vin depuis un petit bout de temps hihi. Ensuite, on nous a gâtés avec une gaufre belge surmonté d'un généreux morceau de poulet frit (très bien cuit  et juteux), assaisoné d'une sauce épicée et d'un coulis de sirop d'érable : O.M.G. (j'en crave ce matin).

D'autant plus que le service était excellent : mon amie a une intolérance au lactose alors on a demandé gentiment si c'était possible d'avoir un sloppy joe sans fromage. Le gars s'est empressé de nous l'emmener, on a trouvé que c'était une gentille attention, étant donné l'événement et le nombre de gens a servir.

Merci de nous avoir accueilli Fabergé, je serai de retour bientôt !"}
{"text":"I visited Fabergé on a Wednesday afternoon and there was no wait. The staff was friendly and derive was great.  I was more than happy with the unique menu options. My friend and I ordered the huevos nuevos and waffles. Everything was delicious. I would definitely visit again the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Greeting and service is a big zero.
Gastronomic experience has to be a balance of all: food and service."}
{"text":"C'est un bel endroit, on s'y bien de part le fait que ce soit cosy.

Si vous avez une petite faim, prenez le granola organique. On prend plaisir à le manger, mais pour un granola, j'ai envie de dire que la quantité était petite.

C'est assez étrange, car c'est comme si je ne pouvais pas me prononcer sur le service. Tout s'est bien déroulé, l'attente ne fut pas interminable, le serveur a fait son travail, mais je ne ressent rien de très négatif ni de très positif. Mon sentiment envers le service est convenable et tout à fait correct!

Malgré tout, ce qui m'a le plus séduite, c'est l'atmosphère qui s'en dégage.

Le petit plus de fin: un flacon gratuit de bain-bouche!"}
{"text":"I had the nuevos huevos, scrambled eggs on a type of torilla. There wasn't enough guacamole plus they forgot the queso fresco. My friend had the chicken and waffles. I stole a bite and it was really good although the potatoes were over cooked. All in all it was good but not outstanding. Would I wait again 30 minutes outside to eat here? Maybe if I was getting the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a weekend brunch, the free drink (nonalcoholic) on check-in is a great bonus. Eggs in a nest was good but my girlfriend's Flambé was better."}
{"text":"I took some friends from out of town here based on super good social media reviews and hype but we ended up being so disappointed. It was pretty disorganized when we got there. There was no clear line up or host taking names and when my friend went up to ask an employee what the wait time was like, her answer was \"hard to say...\" She didn't proceed to take our information or offer us any kind of idea of what the plan was. My boyfriend had to go up and request we be put on a waiting list. All this was fine, we were still really excited about sitting down and eating.

We were seated and our waitress was really sweet but we quickly realized there was no vegan options. My boyfriend and I aren't vegan, but there is usually one option that can accommodate a particular diet. I understand that veganism is a choice but it's rare that a place really has no alternative dietary options. We asked to sub the eggs on the huevos rancheros with tomatoes which they did but it was so wimpy! There was like a teaspoon of baked beans, a slab of uncooked tomato and some tomatillo sauce. My heart broke for my friend especially since this lame little meal still cost her $14.

It was super overpriced and underwhelming. My French toast was only lightly battered on the outside meaning I was pretty much just eating bread and the candied pecans looked like they were from an IGA or something. The chicken and waffles, which my boyfriend ordered, tasted stale. They reminded me of oversized eggos and the fried chicken was overcooked and made with boneless chicken thighs. He couldn't finish them because he found them so gross. 

For that much money and hype I really expected something more delicious. The only thing that tasted bright and fresh was the fruit side plate. I really wanted to like this place but I for sure won't be going back ever."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, waitress was very on top of everything and clearly worked well even though it was extremely busy. The food was pretty good, large portions, but the menu was pretty limited. 

I got their chicken & waffles. The waffles were not that great but the chicken was crispy and very soft on the inside!! Also, their orange juice is freshly squeezed I believe. 

Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"J'avais bien hâte de l'essayer pour comprendre pourquoi les gens semblaient autant raffoler de la place. Je n'ai pas trop compris. Je n'ai pas trouver leur choix de brunch plus original ou alléchant qu'ailleurs. Bien que comme toujours nous avons demandé de nous faire recommander les meilleurs plats, mon copain et moi avons trouvé nos déjeuners très ordinaires et facile à refaire à la maison, en mieux. Allez y plutôt pour l'ambiance, c'est vrai que c'est chouette, mais ne vous attendez pas à de grandes surprises côté bouffe."}
{"text":"Vraiment décevant! C'est la même formule que l'Avenue, et une qualité digne des années 90 quand on faisait pas encore de bons brunch ou déjeuners à Montréal.  Pour le Mile End, c'est assez choquant. La bouffe sort vite... mais mon ami avait une étiquette du supermarché sur sa tomate dans son assiette... 
really nothing to talk about, very ordinary and pretty much mediocre. Given how much incredible food there is in Montreal and the Mile End I don't understand why anyone would wait to go here, or even go at all."}
{"text":"We came in towards closing after a day of exploring the city and very much enjoyed the food. My Benny Mac was tasty (the jalapeno jelly could have had more heat), and the Mexican hot chocolate was spicy and sweet in equal, delicious measure. Wait staff was friendly, though I'm sure at peak times it may be a different experience entirely."}
{"text":"I heard many good things about this place so I decided to try it. 

First I had to wait in line for a table, but once I entered the restaurant I notice there were many tables available... 
Then I waited around 15 minutes to have my order taken. Waited another 30 minutes for the food.

Foods presentation was okay.. I ordered the omelet with potatoes and fruit...It was the worst omelet I have ever had in my life. 

I left feeling hungry, disappointed and never wanting to return again."}
{"text":"Must visit place to visit in Montreal. The menu, atmosphere and service was great. We will definitely visit again.."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place right off the plane, and from what we now know, we stumbled fortuitously. It's a popular brunch spot with a homey diner feel. Staff were attentive and let us put our bags in a hallway out of the way while we ate. The Crêpes Czar, a sweet crêpe filled with spinach, tomato and hollandaise sauce was delicious and exactly what I wanted, not having slept the night before. Coming with crispy chunks of potatoes that *may* have been spiced or battered and a side of sliced fruit. It was filling without being heavy, and the sweetness of the crêpe was a nice accent to the salty potatoes. If it wasn't so far out of the way for us, we'd go back in a second!"}
{"text":"I had their breakfast burrito and although it was not very breakfast burrito-like, it was pretty good. Their side of fruit was sort of old and gross and I also think it is silly to charge extra for maple syrup, but maybe that is just me being a princess.
What I did like was their SUPER cheap bowl of latte. It's only like $3.75. 
They had wonderful service and all of my friends were pretty happy with their experience."}
{"text":"Vraiment dommage! A la première impression ça semblait un endroit plutôt sympa pour bruncher. 1h a se faire servir nos assiettes, les patates dans nos 3 poutines déjeuner pas cuites, on nous laisse payer le tout sans même une excuse, service très froid. Peut être juste un mauvais adon, mais nous n y retournerons pas."}
{"text":"I had a really nice experience at Fabergé. I went on a Saturday around 12, lucky me there wasn't such a big line up. I was seated on a high chair which was very comfortable and allowed me to enjoy the view of the adjacent not so busy street. I had a Pumpkin Latte, one of their Benedictines and a crepe, everything was excellent. It didn't cost much given the size of my plate (app. 30$). I would definitely recommend this place and I will return to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Took two and a half hours to sit down and get our food, they sat us outside in the blazing hot sun where the only umbrella was covering a different table. The food wasn't even good, I could've made it better at home. At the end of our meal the one umbrella came loose and smacked my friend in the back of the head. They just handed us our checks and sent us on our way."}
{"text":"Looked for a breakfast place that wasn't too diner feeling and found this place. Checked in and each received a free drink and used that for lattes. 

When we first came in the guy was friendly and told us to sit anywhere. We ordered drinks first- bf got the plain latte and I got a soy chai latte. We were both very happy that the drinks ended up free because unfortunately both of our lattes were bland and just tasted very milky and with very little taste of our latte. We had some really good coffee and lattes through out our trip in Montreal so at this point we just expected better from our drinks. 1 star off just because I feel that breakfast/brunch cafe should have good or even great coffee. 

I ordered a salmon benedict which came with potato wedges and some fruit. It was delicious and the bf was very happy to finish off my plate when I could not stuff my face anymore. The bf ordered chicken and waffles which I loved that they had on the menu. The chicken was crispy and juicy and the waffles were nice and sweet. Delicious plate. I truthfully am being picky but I feel the place deserves 1 star off because you have to pay $1 or $2 extra for real maple syrup. Not cool. 

Overall the food was good, just not great. And a plus to our server, he was very nice to us and kept checking on our table throughout our long breakfast."}
{"text":"Finally we made it to this famed brunch place and got seats without waiting! The place has a familial ambience and is not that \"hip\"-looking like the other restaurants in Mile End. I was actually surprised because the interior decor was so much like the brunch places in downtown Montreal (read: Universel, Eggspectation, etc) but keeping up with the Mile-End vibe, the staff and the patrons alike seem very chill and enjoyable.

We ordered Chicken Waffle which is basically classic waffles topped with boneless fried chicken with sides of spicy sriracha coleslaw and a bowl of fruits. The portion was so huge that I wish I had ordered just one to share with someone. The quantity is definitely worth the $16 pricing. The potatoes were full of flavor and I loved pairing it with the tomato dip. The fried chicken was crispy, even after I poured maple syrup on it. And it was warm till the last bite. Loved the coleslaw as well. I was so full by the time I could get to the fruits that I ended up skipping 'em. All in all. Great brunch item!

But the stellar item for us was the bloody ceasar. I give that a 5/5 and definitely recommend that to any one who doesn't mind a spiked up spicy drink in the morning. I found the Ceasar very refreshing especially in the summer heat. I took a litchi Mimosa as well but I strongly recommend the Bloody Ceasar. Both cost $7.

The only downside to Fabergé was the wait time fort the food. We waited almost 30mins for our food to come which I think is a bit too long. Otherwise, had a good experience."}
{"text":"Went there early Saturday morning after a long party night.
I was looking for a high calorie breakfast. Went for the breakfast poutine.Potatoes were soggy and overall the poutine was a bit blend. Let's just say I would have not written a letter to my mom about it.

Good thing is that they give you a free drink when you checkin on Yelp. Got the kale smoothie. For the free drink I am upgrading my review from 2 to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Came here on a cold Sunday morning and was seated immediately. We bypassed the groups of 3 and 4 waiting in line because we were a group of 2. As per most brunch places, the seating was fairly cramped; however, the atmosphere was charming as it had cartoons playing on the TV. 
I ordered the Benny Mac which was delicious. The eggs were perfectly poached, the pulled pork was amazing, and the fried Mac and Cheese was wonderful. Jalapeno jelly was sweet rather than spicy but nevertheless provided a nice kick to the meal. The potatoes were SOO GOOD.
Charming server and short wait time for food make for an overall wonderful time!"}
{"text":"We had to wait about 40 minutes outside, which makes sense since it was saturday morning. The food takes a while to come but this is honestly my new favorite brunch in town! The potatoes were excellent, I ordered the chicken waffle and I was amazed. They make killer crepes and smoothies as well. I'll have to bring all of my acquaintances here lol!"}
{"text":"It's one of those brunch places where the lineup is awfully long during weekends. I had the chicken waffle. The chicken was crunchy and it came with a delicious sauce as well as jalapeno peppers. The waffle was ok, nothing impressive. The potatoes that came with it were pretty decent. 

The wait time for the food was long and it seemed even longer since we were hungry. The staff is nice and friendly. The place is located in front of the kem coba ice cream store so it's perfect!"}
{"text":"Very hipster cafe located 20 minutes from the St Joseph's Oratory. We found parking on the street which was on the next block.
Walked in was seated right away around 9:30 am. Our server came over after about 5 mins after looking through the menu. She was very pleasant and attentive, she was great!
We ordered the $9/10 plate of 2 fried eggs, sausage, home fries, fresh fruit on the side (sliced pineapple , cantaloupe , melon).
Coffee was a nice blend rich and bold tasting. With refills. 
Got out at $23.00.
No juice was ordered.
It was served at the perfect temperature and came pretty fast. On the wall was a flat screen tv playing cartoons. Music played in between.
Espresso drinks were available as well.
Outside sitting area available in back for small groups."}
{"text":"Quite a lovely little brunch spot in downtown, had preflight brunch with my coworkers before heading to the airport. Read great reviews and was not disappointed. The shop has a hip and younger crowd and staff. Some tvs up on the wall for light entertainment, they were showing cartoons, inspector gadget! The food was excellent, I ordered smoked salmon Benedict with capers and London fog to drink. Everything was excellent and I was able to use my free Yelp offer to get my tea on the house! This place is fairly popular so be wary of lines and crowds, patience will be needed as the food can take a bit of time to come out. Overall a great dining experience and Id recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Not worth waiting in line for! Just had the most mediocre brunch. Their signature dish Eggs Benedict, The bread was barely toasted The eggs were hard boiled instead of runny. Not impressed by this hipster place, I will say our waitress was very nice and apologetic that we didn't like our food!"}
{"text":"The service was real slow..... And they didn't even look at us when talking to us. My friend ordered a smoked salmon Benedict egg which was not bad. My other friend ordered steak burrito. The burrito was so so but the fries were actually very good. I ordered omelette tofu... Okay I thought it should be omelette with tofu in it, but it was actually an omelette made with tofu.... The texture was very strange to be frank. We ordered blueberry smoothie, which was sweet in a strange way, and strawberry milkshake which was just okay. One thing I don't like was that they serve break with butter instead of jam/peanut butter"}
{"text":"Was super excited to see chicken and waffles on the menu and enthusiastically ordered them along with a breakfast poutine. When the chicken and waffles arrived, I was impressed to see a homemade BBQ sauce and maple syrup on the plate. Unfortunately, the chicken was so dry I couldn't eat it :/ The breakfast poutine on the other hand was fantastic! My stomach hated me for eating something that rich, but the béchamel sauce was so good I ended up wiping the bowl clean with the potatoes from my chicken and waffles plate!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I love the vegan option (tofu scramble) and it's not just an afterthought. Orange juice is fresh squeezed and while I seldom take food pics, I always seem to take photos of the food my partner eats here. This is not a place to miss. A Montreal must."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch place. Food was amazing, the service was great, the ambiance perfect. It was a 20 minute wait, but it was well worth it. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite brunch places to go to. There was quite a line up, even for two people. But I don't believe we waited for more than15 minutes on a saturday morning. The place looks small from the outside, but it is bigger inside. It's a cozy but bright place - excellent for those beautiful days, 

 My friend and I came here for the chicken waffle and it did not disappoint! The chicken was so delicious and the waffles so soft. Drinks are very good too. The chicken waffle was quite large, I can't imagine how I could finish it on my own. Its very decent for the cost though. I ordered a lemonade and my friend ordered the ice tea. Very refreshing on a hot summer day. 

What I really enjoyed the most was the  Wonderful service. Our waitress was extremely courteous and so good at keeping up with everyone's orders while maintaining positive attitude. I do feel like all the waiters and waitresses had similar attitudes, because it really made our experience shine."}
{"text":"We waited about 40 minutes to get a seat, but it was well worth the wait! The staff was friendly and attentive. Between the 4 people in our party, everyone was satisfied with what they ordered. I personally ordered the chicken and waffles, and it was the best I've had to date! I would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"So so great. Sure, we waited in line for nearly an hour and we were starved by the time we were seated but their food did not disappoint. Their menu is fairly extensive and their portions are giant. I had the green smoothie and an omelette, which came with sides of fruit, toast and potatoes (their potatoes are amazing). Good service and beyond satisfying brunch made the wait infinitely worth it! Laurier is a cool area to explore as well when you're walking off your meal, tons of cute shops nearby"}
{"text":"Definitely coming back here the next time I'm in Montreal!! Came here with friends for brunch and everything we ordered was spot on!! The wait wasn't that bad for us at all considering this place was packed. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a good experience in food, service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"People have been trying to get me to come here for months, and I admit, the thing that had turned me off the most was the garish website.

But being hungry, and in the area, I decided to give it a try. Now, as a rule, I only goto places that are extremely vegetarian friendly, and I'd been told by several friends that this place is definitely accommodating to vegetarians. 

First, the good - The service was very good. Our server was friendly, flawlessly bilingual, and generally a pleasure.

The menu very clearly has a Tofu scramble dish, which is the goto vegan breakfast option for many people,  but as an ovo veg, I tend to go for simple egg dishes. I opted for the classique, two eggs, choice of meat, fruit, and bread. The bread selection was impressive, but I'm sad to say Fabergé breaks my cardinal rule - accommodation, by subtraction, not substitution, is not accommodation. This also holds if you make someone pay extra to change their dish with a cheaper option, with a carte blanche, \"$1 charge for all substitutions.\"

One dollar isn't going to break the bank, obviously, but the principle of it means I won't be going back until they drop that ridiculous policy."}
{"text":"The best waffles we have ever had. Great ambiance and staff.  Get here early because the line gets long"}
{"text":"So chill. If I lived in Montreal, I would be here everyday!! 

When you get inside, you're welcomed by the funky city art work and the comfy purple couches. It was just extremely comfortable and relaxing. The lounge music in the background helps to keep the morning vibe upbeat. 

I ordered the Omelette and sausages with home-fries, fruit and bread and coffee. It was standard breakfast food done right with such friendly staff who clearly love working there. 

Nothing but good things can be found here."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés bruncher un samedi pour un anniversaire. Nous avons (évidemment) fais la queue dehors mais l'attente a vraiment valu le coup! Nous étions 5 et tout le monde a eu une super belle expérience. Nous avons fait un checkin avec Yelp et on nous a donné un bon smoothie. La serveuse était très sympathique et la musique des années 80-90 qui jouait dans la place était vraiment bonne. L'ambiance était conviviale et les tv qui diffusaient des cartoon des années 90 ajoutaient à l'atmosphère cool de la place. Nous avons tous été très satisfaits par nos choix de plats. Les patates ont fait l'unanimité. Pour ma part, j'ai pris des ufs bénédictines avec pulled pork sur des galettes de mac n cheese et c'était original et délicieux. Nous y retournerons!"}
{"text":"Solid brunch spot in the mile end. 

They dont take reservations so be prepared to wait in line for 20-40 minutes for a table on the weekend.

We were a group of 5 on a Sunday around 1230. We put our names down at nearby Lawrence and then queued at Faberge. I had heard great things about both. 

Protip if youre waiting for brunch on Fairmount ave --- get a fresh bagel to nibble on at Fairmount Bagels for less than 2$. I know I needed that to hold me over!

Once we were seated at Faberge, we were quickly attended to, ordering juice and coffee. I had eggs benedict (the classic). The eggs were poached just right. The portions are quite large. The eggs came with potatoes and a small fruit salad. The hollandais sauce was a bit too heavy for my liking. I think next time I will ask for it on the side.

Ambiance - its funky yet cozy. There are comics and pop art on the walls, purple wallpaper, benches, & big windows. The restaurant is very busy on the weekends and quite loud inside."}
{"text":"During spring break, me and my friends went on a road trip to Montreal for my friend's birthday and one day decided to stop at this place due to its popularity and reviews. The place was quite a sight to see, the decor, atmosphere and setup was quite comfortable. The restaurant seems to be split into two, one with sofas and the other with booths. 

The service was really friendly and the waitresses there were quite cute even though during lunch hours, it took some time for them to take our meals and such. Although, the waitress recommend us to try out their lattes that isn't in a mug and it was worth the wait. The presentation of the latte was unique and the taste was nothing that I ever tasted.. a much more better latte than in Toronto. 

For my appetizer, I ordered a crepe with REAL Maple Syrup and it was good but wasn't that delicious.  I tried out my friend's mac and cheese and had regretted not getting that instead of what I am about to ordered. 

Unlike many people here, I didn't have a great experience. I ordered the breakfast poutine which seems to be recommended and it unfortunately got me food poisoning and kinda ruined the whole day. Having potatos wedges with gravy, cheese and hollandaise sauce seems to have made it more salty and also the potato wedges were mostly burnt (which attributed to me going to the bathroom alot)..  However the waitress made up for it and I got a free large apple juice on the house which was kind of her. 

However the poutine there was delicious and not as burnt as the breakfast poutine. Overall I would want to come back if I had the chance but in my personal experience, I will never try to breakfast poutine due to that experience."}
{"text":"The best crepes I've ever had! They were light, thin and crispy on the edges. Can't go wrong with classic banana and Nutella. Outdoor seating is nice in good weather and the staff was very friendly! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The bananas and PBJ french toast were great! Easily top 3 I've ever had in life. Definitely try it out"}
{"text":"Wonderfully diverse menu. Warm comfortable environment and excellent service. I was very pleased."}
{"text":"Large large large large portions. Food is great. Steak tastes amazing. Chicken waffles also amazing. Ask for the syrup too! It gets very busy but the waiting time is not too long. There is a lot of different types of drinks if you are interested."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by here for brunch. There was a 30 min wait outside since the place was definitely poppin'. In the mean time, we grabbed fairmont bagels diagonal from here and munched on it while in line. 

Anyway, service was wonderful and so was the food! Got the crepe with ham and Swiss cheese. It came with crispy pan fried potatoes and a small fruit bowl (pineapple, oranges, watermelon). I also ordered a coffee on the side. I love how they do coffee refills here with free of cost as some places don't. I LOVED the potatoes oddly enough... it was just the perfect crispy/crunchy texture on the outside with minimal salt.  My friends and I also ordered a poutine to share. I found the poutine a little bit salty, but then again... I'm from the states so maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about lol. 

Overall, I would definitely come back if it was nearby!"}
{"text":"What can I say... I'm a sucker for poutine, and brunch is my favourite time of day. Put the two together, and you have a breakfast poutine. But it's more like an eggs benedict on potatoes served with cheese curds. I topped mine off with sausages. Super filling, but absolutely delicious. The staff is so nice and not in the slightest bit snobby after their recent stardom (being showcased on CTV, as well as competing in the great Poutine Week).

Great value for what you order, be ready to stand in line behind a ruthless crowd waiting for their chance to get in. Reservations are accepted before 11am and after 2pm. I made a reservation for 2pm on a Sunday and received the biggest look of death and attitude by customers waiting in line as I made my way passed them. (Sorry guys, but it's YOUR fault for not calling in to see if you could take reservations or not!)

PS. Free non-alcoholic beverage with your check-in!"}
{"text":"Brunch heaven! Faberge is serving Crepes, Waffles, French toast, Benedictines, Salads, Burgers, Sandwiches, Omelettes and many more in American, French, Mexican and Canadian style! Yes, it's freakin awesome!

Get free sparkling soda just for checking in on Yelp. Great brunch place with lots of amazing tasty options. Best part, it's also away from tourists hot spots... worth the hike."}
{"text":"Arrive before 11am if you want to avoid the lineup. Service is friendly, and efficient. Staff proves that genuine smiles still exist. 

It's breakfast food, so nothing too inventive but all is fresh and well executed. 

The decor is really great. But the whole place is noisy as hell."}
{"text":"Hopes were high as we sat down at our table at Fabergé. While browsing what touristy culinary treats we had to try, I came across their fabled chicken and waffles. My previous (and only other) experience with the dish was at the Pickle Barrel, and that had been outstanding, so I was hoping for a repeat.

As we waited, we took in the innovative interior decor, which is a little hard to describe in a couple words. It's cool, it's modern, there's a Flavor Flav clock, children's drawings, etc.
They started us with a complementary small blueberry shake for their Yelp check-in promotion. Right after I got my hands on a refreshing caesar, garnished with cherry, pickle, cucumber, and lemon.
Then came the chicken and waffles. It was... pretty good. Unfortunately, it didn't have the same irresistible quality as my previous experience, but I was happy. The chicken was nice and juicy, with mildly powerful seasoning, and the waffles were A-OK. I was sort of hoping for something special with respect to the waffle, but again, it was solidly good. I'd suggest opting for their real maple syrop, which costs a smidge more, but the flavour makes up for it.
The dish is served with a small fruit bowl, a coleslaw-esq salad, potato wedges, and a barbecue sauce. The barbecue sauce was an unfortunate downside to the plate. It just wasn't all that good, especially when the potato wedges needed some help.

All in all, I'd be more than happy to head back to Fabergé. The service is stellar, they serve up a breakfast that hits the spot, and the decor is great. I'd suggest trying the Benny Mac. My friend had it, and walked out a little more joyous than I was."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Tuesday morning so it was not crowded. The place is a decent size and great atmosphere, love the old cartoons playing on the TV. The staff was great. Everything on the menu  sounded good but I opted for a crepe and smoothie. The portions were good and filling. I greatly enjoyed this place and will be back to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a life changing breakfast look no further. Seriously. We researched several rèdifferent breakfast spots and ended up swinging by here and we are so glad we did!!!! 

 Great atmosphere. Beautiful mural on the wall, purple velvet booths paired with \"eames\" chairs. Really funky and so much to look at. 

Our server Maddison was so friendly (we are visiting and don't speak French) really patient and gave us some advice where to rent bikes. 

The food. I'm still wondering how they got the foam so perfect on our cappuccinos. We split the bacon baja Benny special and the Okonomiyaki crepe... every bite just got better and better. The eggs were cooked perfect on the Benny as well as the bacon (crispy!!) the okonomiyaki crepe was SO unique. We asked for a side of their jalapeño jelly and that was so good with the crepe

10/10 will definitely recommend and come back again!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed by this brunch resto. I ordered benedictine but it has nothing special.   It is liked eating at others places for breakfast as Ben&Florentine, Tutti&Frutti but more expensive... 20$ tax tip included for this plate, is that worth?"}
{"text":"Ambiance is cool and artsy. The menu has a wide selection of food, something for everyone. As well the food is pretty good. Solid breakfast joint in the Mile End."}
{"text":"The staff was super nice, although when we asked the hostess to sit outside she said she would need to first bus the table and it would screw up her flow.. Haha, wtf? The line to wait wasn't that bad. The place is very cute. Now for the bad: The food. I got the cheesy bread, it tasted like paper. Absolutely no flavor. My girlfriend ordered the salmon Benedict which was also very flavorless. Not sure why everyone keeps saying it's so delicious. I'm an easy going person and wouldn't say it just to say it, the food was not good. It filled me up for sure but I don't enjoy eating just to be full. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was agreeable, good but didn't blow me away. 
My husband loved it though, he got an omelette (Expos) and cleaned it right up. 
I got the pork mac and cheese benny (Benny Mac) and we shared a nutella crepe.
Both main dishes came with a side of potatoes, they looked a little burnt and tasted bland. 
My eggs benny was pretty good, the pork was tender and served as a good combination with the mac and cheese.
As a fan of eggs bennies, I feel like the hollandaise sauce makes or breaks the experience and the one accompanied with this dish was just alright. Yolk's has set the standard high for me in terms of eggs bennies + potatoes. 
All in all, it was a good experience. Good ambiance and our waitress was amazing, she was really tentative and friendly. 
I would drop by if I was in the area, but I wouldn't seek it out deliberately."}
{"text":"My kind of place, bulky beefin' brunch. I had the chicken and waffles. Great atmosphere and they have a nice layout. Cartoons on the TV somehow enhanced my brunching experience. It was a heavy snow day, and i think big breakfasts or lunch should hit me right in the nostalgia without too much complication.  Flashy and fancy here, the presentation is well done with good service. It's all I ask for in the morning when I am probably hung over."}
{"text":"So, I went to Fabergé last Saturday with my girlfriend, and I was pretty stoked when she suggested it, since we had both hear great things about the place and were eager to try what has been dubbed as one of the best breakfasts in Montreal. 

It's been six days, almost a full week, and I thought that if I waited to write my review my anger would have surely subsided by now, and I may let up on them just a little. But, I'll be the first to admit that I was wrong. I'm still pissed and really, really confused.

I guess I will start from the beginning. We waited in line for about 30-45 minutes, which was just fine with me. I've waited in line for far longer at L'Avenue and I would happily wait in line for a full six hours for the crêpes pommes-cheddar. So waiting less than an hour on a late Saturday morning didn't phase me.When we were seated, I was very impressed with my surroundings. Great decor. Absolutely lovely. I particularly loved the Flava Flav clock on the wall near the kitchen. Looking at the menu, I was impressed with the number of options, and had a difficult time choosing. 

I am a huge fan of huevos rancheros, and am always eager to try them wherever I go, even though in this city, I'm usually disappointed (side note: for the rancheros of your life, go to Le Gros Jambon). So, naturally, I ordered the rancheros, which were listed under Specialities. Promising, right?

Again, I was wrong. When the dish arrived, my heart sank. It LOOKED disappointing. Huevos rancheros is usually a dish with a little height to it, given there are so many components stacked one on top of the other. But if I were to get down at eye level with my plate, I would not have been able to see my food over the edges of the plate.

The eggs were cooked to perfection, I'll give them that. But it was all downhill from there. From a bird's eye view, or just the view you get looking down at your plate when it's on the table in front of you, it looked like it was a plain ol' pair of sunny side up eggs placed on top of two corn tortillas, with guac and salsa served on the side. Moving the egg a little, I could see there was indeed some refried black bean and pickled onion sandwiched between the egg and tortilla. There was about enough bean spread to cover my thumb nail (I'm a girl with dainty hands), and no trace of sour cream whatsoever, as advertised on the menu. The \"pickled\" onion tasted as though it had been dipped into vinegar for a nanosecond before tossing it on the plate. There was nothing pickled about that onion.

The guacamole was alright. Nothing more than mashed avocado with no trace of seasoning, but I won't complain very much about that, because I could eat an avocado like an apple. The salsa was not verde, not anything close to a salsa verde. They gave me a pitiful corn salsa, which is yellow, by the way, not verde. You don't need to know what yellow means in Spanish, Fabergé, but I think if you're running a restaurant it should be assumed you know what a salsa verde is. Okay, I'll stop ranting about that. Anyway, the corn salsa consisted of dry, wrinkly canned corn, a bit of tomato and a bit of white onion. No seasoning. No cilantro. Not even a trace of lime to give the dish some brightness. 

The potatoes served with the dish were huge. So big that I needed to quarter them to be able to take a bite out of them. And no, these weren't whole potatoes. Just enormous chunks of under-seasoned starch. I was lucky enough to get a bite out of a nice green bit, which was entirely my fault, since I wasn't paying very much attention to what I was grabbing with my fork. 

But aside from the near nonexistent black beans, the unpickled pickled onions, the lack of sour cream, the salsa that could be outdone by Old El Paso, and the meteor-sized potatoes, there is one thing about this dish that cannot be forgiven. 

You see, in any huevos rancheros dish, the corn tortillas are generally lightly fried, or, at the very least, warmed. But Fabergé did not fry their corn tortillas, let alone warm them. They served me straight-from-the-fridge-and-tossed-onto-the-plate corn tortillas. Look. You need to heat your corn tortillas. Not only does it help with pliability, it makes them taste, you know, not like frozen sliced bread. And the worst thing is, I know that I didn't just get a shoddy dish. This is how they MEANT to serve the dish, because I saw a server walk by with the same dish for another person. No difference.

Whoever is in the kitchen that is in charge of assembling the huevos rancheros, Google them and learn what they actually are. Or call me. I have a great recipe. 

At the very least, take them off of your freaking Specialities list. 

After all this, I can't even get into my girlfriend's breakfast poutine. Not as disappointing, but definitely nothing to feel satisfied with.

Skip Fabergé, go almost anywhere else."}
{"text":"The service was a little slow. However, the food was really good, I had the salmon eggs benedict but the menu has a big variety of options!  It's a trendy place."}
{"text":"Waited a really long time for brunch on a Monday afternoon. Worth the wait! The decor inside is really cute. I ordered the Le Massif and was very pleased. The French toast is amazing with their strawberry jam! Their moccachino was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Went there and had the breakfast poutine. It was really good. Also took the chicken waffle to go. Was perfect for supper... did not need to have a lunch with that breakfast."}
{"text":"Want a great breakfast? Check out this cute little place. First time there, I had the Eggs in a Nest. Two thick slices of cheesy bread with an egg cooked into the middle with a side of home potatoes and fruit. Really hits the spot on a cold fall morning. 

OK, so the service is a little slow but it's bearable. At least you're not waiting in line like those fools going to Beauty's. :)

When you're done, get yourself across the street for some authentic Montreal bagels!"}
{"text":"Location: Mile End... you'll either need to drive and pray for a parking spot on the way there, or use public transit. 

The place: Pretty cool - they had some funky art happening on the main wall by the window that I liked. The place has a pretty relaxed feel to it and there's lots of yellow. Or maybe it's beige... Something like that. Anyway, the vibe is chill. In terms of clientele, there was a good mix of people but sadly, I couldn't complain about the Hipsters taking over the place. Not yet, anyway - I'm sure that's temporary. You'll find people of all ages and dress codes with no pretense whatsoever. 

The food: They have a pretty varied menu and I was in one of those moods where I didn't feel like reading so I skipped right to the omelets. These are build-your-own and all you need to do is select three ingredients and voilà - you're done. I went for caramelized onions, wild mushrooms and breakfast sausage because I was feeling a little meaty. My omelet arrived, piping hot, with a side of potatoes and fruit. I enjoyed the omelet very much; it was nice and fat and had the perfect mixture of ingredients - not too much or too little of one ingredient over another.  The potatoes left me feeling indifferent, however. They were crispy on the outside, which I like, but the inside was very dry so I suspect they were over-cooked. Additionally, they were sorely lacking in flavor. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict and loved them. Apparently their specialty is chicken and waffles so I'd like to try that out. I really had to fight back the urge to pull a Bill Murray and grab a waffle out of my neighbor's plate - them waffles looked REAL good!

Service: Pretty good. We were greeted upon entering and they prepared a table for us very quickly. There did seem to be a lot of employees floating around the place - I constantly felt like I was surrounded by waiters.

Overall, I liked this place and would return. The only downside was where we were sitting - right by the door. Every time someone came in, we felt the cold draft, and people sort of piled up right behind me. The up side is that we were right by the window, so there was a lot of natural light."}
{"text":"This place does not meet my standards for a Montreal brunch. I thought the food was only so-so. There are so many other great brunch places in Montreal and this one just didn't do it for me. The menu is not that special. Dishes are mostly potatoes, eggs, and cheese based."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The service impeccable. Janet served our table and she was not only helpful with our choices in food, but also gave tips as to where to shop around the area! She actually drew us a whole map! 

If I lived in Montreal this would be my go to brunch spot. Delicious. My mouth is still watering :)"}
{"text":"Our stop into Faberge was prompted by the great reviews and proximity to where we were staying. I'm thrilled with the overall experience we had; service was friendly and fast, my americano was spot on, and the overall quantity/price ratio of food was excellent. The ambiance is fantastic; I love the painted walls, and the old looney tunes cartoons that were showing on a TV in the background. 

Worth a look if you want a big, fat, brunch or breakfast and a cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant, vibe, menu and presentation. Crowded for brunches on a Sunday but a 15 min wait isn't that long compared to Lawrence's or other spots on the Plateau.
We decided to go for the Specialties! Chicken Waffles and the Breakfast Poutine. We really liked it :) Tasty, enough sauce in both plates; huuuge Chicken Waffle plate.. Suggestion : more \"squick squick\" cheese in the poutine - there were only tiny little cheese curds - and maybe a different spice for the chicken than the side potatoes. Spiced potatoes and spiced chicken = taste the same :/

Hot Chocolate lovers will be served! $4 well invested. Miam :D

We were very impressed with the host's service, and less impressed with our waiter's, but overall it was a very good experience. They played the oldschool Hip Hop that we like; we r old lol :P"}
{"text":"By leaps and bounds the best breakfast and brunch place in Montreal. I have searched this city far and wide for a place like this and no other exists. The fried chicken and waffles can not be beat in Montreal, and their omelettes are to perfection. The quality of their teas and coffees is exceptional."}
{"text":"The highlight of my trip! Fabergé's food is phenomal! Every bite was savored and if you're looking to enjoy a wonderful brunch - alone or with friends - I promise you that THIS is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with a colleague who lives in Montreal and RAVES about this place. Apparently it's difficult to get seats here on a weekend so I was ecstatic that we went on a weekday morning! 

I was really in the mood for eggs benedict and all of their options made my mouth water. In the end, I opted for the Rustique (wild mushrooms and St. Paulin cheese on an English muffin). WOW. This was delicious! It was also a good portion size. I devoured the eggs too quickly and was too full to finish my home fries :( My colleague ordered a coffee and mentioned that it was good as well except that it wasn't piping hot. Other than that, we were all super happy with our meal. 

Service was pretty quick and staff were friendly. I also loved the decor and set up of the place. I can see why they've received overwhelmingly positive reviews here...definitely a great place for breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! The espresso is dark and delectable. Looked at the menu and couldn't even decide from the wide variety of options! I settled for the Le Boston (French toast with dark chocolate and pastry cream), which was an amazing choice. The pastry cream was not too sweet and light and airy; a perfect combination! I also had a side of the poutine, which wasn't the best in the city, but it was still amazing. Seemed like it had a bit of an Asian flair to it; a bit of soy sauce in the gravy? Overall, the service was OK. We sat at the counter and they were quite busy, so it took some time to get served and to have our coffee refilled. I'd love to go back and eat more items from the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken and waffles! Amazing, fluffy and light homemade waffles, maple syrup to your heart's content, spicy chicken batter covered moist chicken, home style potatoes and fruit. 
Coffee was strong and unlimited, included with your meal. 

The staff was so helpful! I brought my 80 year old grandmother and they were so accommodating. Everything from assuring she had a place for her bag, she was comfortable on her bar stool, and closing the door to block the draft. 

The waitress at the bar was wonderfully pleasant. 

A definitely must try for breakfast. It might have become my number 1 breakfast joint in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I'm here right now it was deliciois, really cute place. People are nice but the service is really slow"}
{"text":"The breakfast poutine is literally the best thing I've probably ever tasted. I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about that poutine. There's always a line at weekends but it's worth the wait. Service is great too"}
{"text":"OMG soooo good!!!! If you don't show up completely ravenous and can endure the line this may be one of the greatest brunch spots I've ever experienced. Staff was incredibly nice and gave us fantastic suggestions. LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"La poutine matinale, bien loin de ce que l'on peut imaginer, est tout simplement malade! 
De plus les smoothies verts sont délicieux (ce qui permet d'équilibrer le repas... dirons nous...)
Le seul problème c'est le line up interminable. C'est d'ailleurs pour ça que je n'ai pas encore goûté au reste de la carte..."}
{"text":"We'll be coming back every time we're in Montreal, as I think it would take about 50 visits to get through the massive menu! A super warm and cozy spot that serves fresh, innovative takes on traditional breakfast food. My wife and I had the spinach and feta omelette, the breakfast poutine, and the crepes, and every item was unique and delicious. They serve alcohol as well, though it was a bit early in the morning for us. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lots of hype around this place, as is the way in Montreal. Visited three times, despite horrible experiences each time. Will never return. I mean, where to start? The menu is uninspired. The food is wicked salty. The staff is snotty and inattentive (we waited for a bill for more than an hour once!). Crowded and uncomfortable. The last time we visited, it was more than an hour for our lunch order. Our complaints were met with attitude, so we crossed it off the list of places to go."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars (Adam rating 2 stars)
Visited this place because of the hype and was a bit let down. The menu is great, fried chicken and waffle omg, but the service and overall feeling when you're there is just eh. They're very busy so the servers are naturally curt and impersonal. It's normal but brunch is supposed to be more relaxed and fun. 

I ordered the fried chicken and waffles and it was good. I just had an issue with how cooked the chicken was, it was still a little pink inside. The waffles were also really bleh. The portion is more than fair for the price tag, but I'd rather it be cheaper and smaller. It was way too much food.

Adam got the breakfast poutine and it was kinda small for the price. He also said the flavours were just ok."}
{"text":"Je suis séduite par l'originalité du menu et le style de la place. Côté goût, on dirait que je me serais attendue à plus,  mais c'était tout de même très bien. Dernière chose, le bruit ambiant est assez fort,  au point d'en dérangeant à certains moments."}
{"text":"The line outside is worth the wait. Our party of four sat at the bar. I don't normally like sitting at the bar, but this one has corners where it was nice for our sized party. The food was great! The girl behind the bar was nice and accommodating. Everyone was nice. The venue was bigger than I expected."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant bien sympa, tranquille.

J'ai trouvé qu'ils avaient vraiment bien choisi leur nom : Fabergé, vu que leurs spécialités sont les ufs. Je me demandais si j'allais retrouver des pépites d'or ou de petites pierres précieuse dans mon assiettes ;).

Pour ce qui est du service ni excellent ni mauvais, le serveur a juste fait sa job (en même temps on est arrivé à la fin du service donc peut être petit coup de fatigue). Mais nous avons tout de même été servis rapidement.

Pour le repas j'ai pris 'L'enfumé\" : sur muffin anglais, saumon fumé et ufs poché avec une bonne petite sauce, équilibre des goûts vraiment parfait. Les patates étaient vraiment bonnes aussi, et la petite coupe de fruit frais était un bon petit dessert."}
{"text":"When it comes to eating out, I probably enjoy brunch the most. While I was looking for a new place to try out, I came across this little gem and took a couple seconds gasping at the bicycle latte art. 

I went to this place with the main intention of getting a bicycle latte. The art on the wall added a modern drift to this whole place. 

When the waiter came I asked him to make me a bicycle on my latte (probably with a bit too much enthusiasm). He laugh and said he'll see what he can do. Boy, I have to say he outdid himself. 

The portions here are pretty big. I didn't even end up finishing. Nonetheless it was a pretty hearty breakfast with beautiful presentation. If I ever pass by this neighbourhood I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"So I'll preface this review with the fact that I had been here before and really liked the food I had ordered. That is what makes this visit all the more disappointing. Things started off great - we didn't wait long to be seated and I got my OJ right away. Shortly thereafter, we ordered our food. Here's where things went down hill.

45 minutes after our order, nothing. We finally flagged down our server to ask what's taking so long, and he said \"Oh, I see your order, I'll be back shortly.\" Well guess what, he disappeared for another 10 minutes, at which point we simply gave up and left. I left more than enough money on the table to cover the OJ, but on the way out, nobody asked us anything.

Very disappointing and ruined our morning! I highly doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food, love the Massive, but its a very noisy place, if you are looking for a cozy place to discuss and eat at the same time, you shall skip it, at least on a week-end base... :("}
{"text":"Phenomenal brunch in Mile End. I came here on a Saturday afternoon and luckily didn't have to wait long because there happened to be a table for 4 that was available even though there was a line up out the door. I would recommend to anyone waiting in line to have a friend run across the street to Fairmount bagel to grab a couple of bagels to go and enjoy those in line as you wait to be seated. 

As for the food here, absolutely loved the eggs benedict and the Nutella crepe. The drip coffee was good, but I had to call the waiter a couple of times to get a refill. The fried chicken is also fantastic but the waffles were average. Also, they charge $2.00 for maple syrup (what's up with that?)

Definitely a great place for brunch, just be prepared to wait in line if you don't get here before 11am."}
{"text":"I like the decor of this place, especially the wooden tables. The set up is very simple and humble :)

I took their chicken waffle, which is supposedly one of their popular dishes and people's favourite. I see the effort to be different, but i feel like those two don't mix together. Also, their waffle felt dry because of the lack of sauce (not because it wasn't properly made). The side of potatoes were not bad, but not extraordinary.

My cousin took a breakfast poutine, and that was nothing short of awesome!

We also had the opportunity to try their \"hong kong style coffee\". It was an item written on a board, and off the menu. It came in a glamorous mason jar, with whip cream and a biscotti. I'd give this drink a 3/5. The taste of the coffee was there (although it's actually a mix of tea and coffee), but this drink is supposed to be a simple beverage in hong kong culture. It's supposed to be served just like a regular coffee. Imagine I put whip cream on your tim hortons black coffee, and throw in a biscotti. Ah well, nice try though! If you take out all the glamour, it's not bad.

Service is impeccable, timely dishes and constant coffee refills, as well as polite and engaging waitress :)

Even though this review is a 3 star, i'd still go back and try other stuff on their menu, and i'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The staff were probably the friendliest non-Americans we encountered during our stay.  Does that makes sense?  Pretty creative breakfast and lunch dishes.  My husband had poutine breakfast (potatoes, cheese curds, no gravy, poached eggs, hollandaise).  He loved it.  I had a candied pecan french toast, served with honey, maple syrup, and yogurt.  The yogurt tasted like sour cream, but I think that happens sometimes. The yogurt was still tasty.  I wished I had some butter for the french toast, and I wish it was a little more 'eggy' or 'wet'.  Still, it was good tasting, and both of our servings were generous.  We had some for the ride home.   Interestingly, peanut butter was available in a caddy on the table along with jelly.   I encountered that at a couple of places.  This place also offered a flavored vanilla oolong iced tea.  Good!"}
{"text":"Our party of four arrived around 10:45 in the morning (Saturday). There were a couple of parties ahead of us. By the time we left, the line was out the door and around the corner! 
The service was very good and the menu is expansive. Our breakfast selections included: duo of crepes (banana & Nutella), Big Poppa (breakfast sandwich served with potatoes & fruit), classic eggs and Huevos Nuevos. The latter was eggs, guacamole and salsa verde served on a potato flatbread which I found to be more of a tortilla consistency as you would have to fold it over to eat it like a taco. I ate the filling only which was very good. It came with a nice side salad & rice. 
Portions are generous. Our group had coffee/soda but there is a good selection of beverages,  both alcoholic and non."}
{"text":"Food is average, nothing special. Eggs benedict lack flavour. Their hollandaise sauce is too thick and heavy. Waffles are thick and arent cripsy. The batter is lacking sweetness or overall just create a new batter. No matter how much syrup I put on the waffles, they remained dry and heavy. 

But what blows my mind is the quality of food that is put out from the kitchen. All plates should be checked by the chef, the server and the waitress before being placed on the clients table. We ordered the Belle province and the OG with strawberries. When the OG came out I couldnt believe my eyes!! It was a plate of waffles with two strawberries, REPHRASE a strawberry cut in half! Not to mention that Belle Province waffle was missing the whip cream. What angers me is that the kitchen allowed these plates to leave their kitchen and they had the balls to serve this to a paying customer. Honestly, a lot of people wouldn't dare to say anything, afraid that their plates would be tampered with. Do not be rude about it but speak up if your food is shitty! You're paying for  your food, you should get it the way it was advertised. 

Our waitress was completely understanding and gave us the rest of our waffle. In conclusion, I will not be returning because the food isnt anything great. The kitchen and the serving staff need to be reevaluated. I dont know if the kitchen got lazy with our plates but it is not acceptable! If you're going to spend money on breakfast, do it right and go elsewhere like Petinos."}
{"text":"We checked this place out for brunch on our last day in Montreal (it was a Saturday). Faberge has amazing reviews so it was an obvious brunch choice. The place was bumping when we got there, SO MANY people waiting for tables. Most people looked like they were in big parties so we squeezed through the crowd (no easy feat) and asked how long it would be for two. We waited like 3 minutes for a table and got envious stares from those still waiting. Service was pretty good, coffee was good quality, and our eggs benedicts were tasty but nothing was extraordinarily good so I just couldn't understand why there was a such a long line. 

Overall I enjoyed my experience at Faberge because despite having such crowds, everyone was calm and the service didn't lack. But the food was standard good brunch food, nothing particularly stood out or impressed me in a way that would make me want to face a brunch line that long. 

I'd def recommend this spot for brunch/breakfast but be weary of a long wait on weekends!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and she couldn't have chosen a better place! The menu was awesome offering a variety of delicious options for all food lovers! I ordered the chicken and waffles (TO DIE FOR!!!) and the poutine (also DELICIOUS!!!). The portions are ridiculous and for a good price! 

My only complaint was the service was a bit slow, as it took us (group of 5) a while to get our food. But it was also super busy! Either way I enjoyed my food and had enough to take home to my sister! May I add still taste awesome re-heated!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival for brunch this weekend we were met with quite indifference. We were asked for 30 minuted to seat a party of 6 and agreed. After 1 hour of waiting and checking in with the host, there was no sympathy or sense of urgency. Unfortunately I am unable to rate the food as I could not bear another possible disappointment. No value for clientele. Try your luck with this one."}
{"text":"Il y a un an, j'ai mis 4 étoiles à ce restaurant, on avait vraiment aimé l'endroit et le menu, comme on habitait tout près on y allait très souvent et on le recommandait à notre entourage. Mais nos dernières visites n'ont pas été à la hauteur et aujourd'hui une catastrophe. 
On était trois, nos assiettes ont mis du temps à arriver et j'ai même attendu 10 minutes de plus avant d'avoir la mienne. On a constaté que les deux autres assiettes n'étaient pas complètes, il manquait des éléments qui étaient annoncés sur le menu, on a donc demandé à ce que ça soit corrigé, encore de l'attente ! Il a aussi fallu relancer pour une bière, les bagels... 
Le service a été long, pas très agréable, du moins on était habitué à mieux...  C'est vraiment dommage car on adorait cette place et on en sortait toujours content mais aujourd'hui on a été très déçus. 
C'était surement notre dernière visite là-bas."}
{"text":"I LOVE FABERGÉ !!
The ratio quality / price / quantity is really good so far the best I found 
The menu is really diversified, the portion are more than reasonable and it's always good. I've never been disappointed.
The interior is nice, nothing special however it is amazing to eat on the terrasse during summer.
The best: Le fumé"}
{"text":"Known for their chicken and waffles, i decided to order the steak and eggs.

i dont want to say i didn't like it but i've had better steaks. This one was over done and over spiced. 

I loved he portion and the potatoes that came with it.

Americano was the best i've had in a long time"}
{"text":"I'm kind of a purist when it comes to poutine - I don't usually indulge in varieties. I (used to) believe that the point of comfort food is that it is supposed to adhere to tradition, so that you can get exactly what you expect every time and be satisfied.

That being said, I had the breakfast poutine at Fabergé and it was excellent. Potato wedges, gravy, melty cheese, hollandaise sauce and a fried egg on top. It was a huge bowl for $10 and totally worth it.

In general I found the prices here to be very reasonable. My friends all had big portions and everything we ordered was great. The service was good and friendly and they immediately brought crayons for my friend's kid (which, in conjunction with the cartoons being played on all the TV screens, kept her happy and quiet the whole time). It's a fairly informal atmosphere, so don't expect the staff to be waiting on you hand and foot. If you need something, you might have to make some noise to get quicker service."}
{"text":"Average 

Fabergé Club was nothing special. Fries were too salty and chicken sandwich looked and tasted ordinary."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm all about eggs Benedict and Mac and cheese...so when I saw they had a Benny Mac I came running ! Oh was it so worth it, I was a little nervous it would be too much but I loved the combination!! I split that was the breakfast poutine which to be honest I would skip next time. It just didn't do anything for me considering all the other places in Montreal with an amazing poutine. I would for sure go just to try the Benny Mac tho, superb!! A little slow on service but friendly staff."}
{"text":"For muslims, I recommend Benedict Rustique, or benedict le fume.
I do not recommend chicken waffle. They have much more interesting brunches and chicken waffle was ordinary chicken between 2 waffles."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken and waffles. Great service. Great rustic wild mushroom eggs bennie.
Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"A popular spot at Sunday lunchtime. Groups crowd outside and inside, hungry diners hope for a cup of joe while they wait. Graffiti like paint adds both wall and table flair - complete with gold! Happy that I didn't have to wait, as I was dining solo, I was swiftly put into an *afterthought* of a table. Wobbly and situated just below the upper level's exposed bench -- complete with an almost-headrest made of jackets swimming over head -- there I was, almost in the flow of traffic, facing a server's prep station. But I didn't really care. I was hungry. 

The brunch menu is robust! Eggs in \"nests\", steak and eggs, crepes and waffles, benny's, omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, pancakes. They're all there. I went for the basics 2 eggs with ham, bacon or sausage, served with a fruit bowl, roasted potatoes and toast. There's a smaller and larger version of the same, leaving all appetites appropriately satiated. 

When my over easy eggs and sausage made it to my table, I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed. It was definitely diner style with a steeper price tag. The two sausage links looked like they had been cooked in separate batches: one was blackened on one side and dry. The other was underdone, with not a hint of browning on its skin. The potatoes were missing seasoning. All in all, it was pretty dull. Perhaps I expected too much, and for ambiance, they've got it on a Sunday afternoon. I'd be tempted to test some of their more adventurous dishes - the nests are intriguing, nestled in cheese bread as the menu states."}
{"text":"La poutine déjeuner ça faisait un bout que je voulais l'essayer. J'avais vraiment de grosses attentes, et Fabergé a passé le test. Commençons par la base de tout brunch: Les patates. Ah les patates! Dans mon livre, si un restaurant déjeuner rate ses patates il est barré de ma liste. Parfaitement assaisonnées, coupées grossièrement et cuites à la perfection, j'ai pu les goûter dans le meilleur contexte possible: Sous le fromage fondant, la décadente sauce hollandaise, les oignons caramélisés et les poivrons rouge de leur fameuse poutine déjeuner. Surmonté d'un oeuf poché au jaune parfaitement coulant, c'était si magnifique que j'aurais pu pleurer. L'assiette était immense, tellement qu'au tier du plat mon corps m'envoyait des signaux de saturation stomacale. Mais j'ai quand même terminer le tout jusqu'à la dernière bouchée, c'était délicieux à ce point là. 

Niveau déco c'est vraiment sympa, et quand on est venu il y avait les vieux cartoons de Transformers qui passaient sur leur 2 écrans plats. Déjeuner en écoutant les petits bonshommes comme quand j'avais 5 ans, j'aime ça. Vraiment, tout était parfait! Mon seul bémol va au niveau du service. On était 6, et nos plats sont arrivés à coup de 2 à environ 5-7 minutes d'intervalles. On voyait même les dernières assiettes, prêtes à être servies depuis un bon 10 minutes, mais les serveurs préféraient jaser entre eux au lieu de nous servir. Peut-être sommes-nous juste tombés malchanceux? Va falloir que j'aille remanger une autre poutine pour le confirmer..."}
{"text":"Arguably the best brunch/breakfast spot in the city. Great diversified menu and good prices for the portions. Excellent drink menu as well. I've had the breakfast poutine, la belle province, mushroom eggs benny and the huevos rancheros.... never disappointed with the quality of the food here! There are lineups on the weekends but I've never had to wait on a weekday. It's a trendy spot that's for sure. Every time i bring someone here, they are also very satisfied."}
{"text":"Found this lovely restaurant on a blog showcasing the best Breakfast spots around Montreal. Well, that blog was absolutely right about the deliciousness that is Fabergé. I had the eggs on a nest and, not only was it delicious, but it was served so beautifully and it was a perfect serving size. I did not feel too stuffed nor not stuffed enough. 

The decor of this place is also pretty amazing. It had a very modern feel to it that made the experience and even better one. 

I'd like to add that ,whoever is in charge of the music , should be promoted! I believe that a good soundtrack to a breakfast adds and extra \"umph\" to the experience and we got that \"umph\"."}
{"text":"Coming to Faberge is sin for me, but I do it again and again, even if I have to wait 1 hour in line. 

My favourite dish is definitely the mac and cheese eggs benedict (they are much better than the chicken and waffles!!!) The mac and cheese is fried to a perfect crispy texture and then topped with ham and poached eggs and finished off with hollandaise sauce. It is so delicious but so heavy and so fatty. 

They are also quite know for their chicken and waffles, with very crispy chicken, syrup (definitely opt for maple syrup even thought it is extra) and soft sweet waffles. 

One of my friend got the peanut butter and jelly french toast and it is the only dish from them that I wouldn't recommend, not because it is not good but because it does not compare to the rest of their menu. 

Overall, great fatty brunch place, make sure to come early because the lineups get crazy around 10:30!"}
{"text":"Mon. resto. à brunch. PRÉFÉRÉ! J'en suis folle, il faut que je me retienne pour ne pas y retourner à chaque fois que je vais bruncher.

Les portions sont généreuses, le menu très varié, et les patates sont phénoménales. Les télévisions qui font jouer les \"bonshommes\" de notre enfance donnent le ton à la parfaite journée de farniente de la fin de semaine. En plus, la déco est vraiment mignonne. 

J'ai déjà testé les lunchs en semaine, qui m'ont moins enthousiasmés que les brunchs. La poutine était bonne, par contre!

À tester absolument. Il faut s'attendre à faire la queue une quinzaine de minutes environ."}
{"text":"Belle place! 
Service courtois et dynamique.

Omelette Expo: correct sans plus.
Patates: miam, mais un peu froides.
Fruits dans un bol à part: très apprécié!! 
Bénédictine Philly: super! 

C'est une bonne place de brunch et j'y retournerai sans hésiter...mais est-ce que c'est la meilleur place en ville...je ne crois pas. Rien qui se démarque des autres."}
{"text":"Last time I passed by and found a big line of this place, so I decided to try their brunch. We came at 10 in the morning and waited a while then get our table, the service is good, but the time to wait for the food is so long, almost 50 minutes. About the food, we ordered waffle and chicken, just so so. And this place is too hot, I felt like I had a heat stroke."}
{"text":"AMAZING brunch spot! Definitely a gem. I ordered the classic egg platter and a peach mimosa. The food came out quickly and the drinks were delicious! The atmosphere is chill and comfortable with a great music selection. If I come back to Montreal I will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"I had two friends recommend coming here for breakfast when visiting Montreal and they did not steer me wrong! 

I ordered the shakshouka, the waitress warned me this batch was spicy but I didn't care. It was delicious. I was with a group who never had tried shakshouka and they all tried some and loved it like I did. 

A few others ordered the Monsieur jambon crepe, PB & J french toast, the Expos omelette, and the Classiques eggs. Everyone loved their meals, me included since we all tried each other's.

I want to highlight the PB & J French toast, it was thick but not heavy. Stuffed with peanut butter, topped with strawberry jam, and with a side of fresh whipped cream. Basically, mouth watering as I'm writing this review, yum. 

The decor and atmosphere here is family friendly but hip and great for all ages and diverse styles. I look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Les brunchs sont excellents, variés et le service rapide et plaisant.
Coup de cur : le chocolat chaud, wow!
Et un cadre design, confortable, j'adore la peinture mur plafond de Montréal."}
{"text":"3.5 is the real rating I give here. 
Setting: saturday morning brunch
Food: I had benedict eggs. It was good but nothing to make it stand out. The portion was good, the potatoe were tasty. 
Service: very good service. The waiter was there for our every need. However, since we went there probably on the busiest day of the week, as soon as we were done eating, bills came and so did the interac machine. The table was emptied besides our glasses of water. So without being told, we were nicely kicked out. 
Atmosphere: Very noisy. Felt a bit like a cafeteria, for we had to speak louder than usual to understand each other. 
Overall: Faberge was worth the try but I'd recommend avoiding busy days for a cosier experience."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch, nice atmosphere definitely give it a go! Went on a Wednesday morning and the place was nearly full. I had the bacon waffles with blueberry jam which were delicious! If I ordered them again I might ask for the jam on the side as it was tidge sweet for my tastes. I will definitely go back to try out some more of the menu"}
{"text":"En synthèse, j'ai A-DO-RE.
Ce n'était pourtant pas gagné puisque, à la base, j'avais envie de pancakes et que le Fabergé ne propose pas ce plat.

En arrivant, l'accueil est agréable et je suis séduite par le lieu et la déco, assez difficile à catégoriser. Nous optons pour une table en vitrine pour profiter du beau soleil qui inonde la rue.

En étudiant longuement la carte, je me suis laissée tentée par le pain doré aux fraises. 
Le plat est généreux et les tranches dorées sont surmontées par des fraises très légèrement compotées. Un délice !

Mon seul regret ? Ne pas être revenue pour tester le pain doré aux bleuets."}
{"text":"Have visited here several times for just 1 reason: waffles with fried chicken! Hip environment and friendly waiters. The TVs there constantly play old school cartoons like transformers or Dr gadget. Pretty cool"}
{"text":"Nice place to go for brunch with friends! When we went there, on a saturday morning, we waited approximately 30 minutes before getting seated  on the little terasse at the back of the restaurant. Really nice spot to have private conversations! The service was good, waiters were nice. I had benedictine eggs which were good but not amazing. I planned on trying the waffle and chicken since I haven't been to any good place for that in Montreal so far."}
{"text":"Food was OK but the wait and service is terrible.
Please do your self a favor and go somewhere else.

Waited outside for 1hr
Waited 45min for food
Screwed up the order
Waitress was nowhere to be found
Not even an apology for the 30min for my correct order to be made.

FAIL"}
{"text":"Got the apple cheddar caramel crepe and it was pretty good.  Wish it had come with some fruit or something.  Service was okay, but in their defense it was ridiculously busy.  Coffee was decent."}
{"text":"Out of morbid curiousity seeing a stretching outside of the restaurant I figured there was a pretty good reason why and it was decided we'd brave it. The wait was about 20-25 min. So not as long as you'd think. The fare is kind of like the new wave diner/brunch spots even here in the States with many brunch favorites with the breakfast usuals amplified in portion, addition and presentation. I got the Chicken and waffles. I may have to say it was the best I've had thus far. 2 big waffles cut into 4 pieces, with capital \"C\" crispy cutlets on each one with bbq sauce for dipping and syrup. Also has a fruit cup, seasoned potatoes and relish cup. Their proud Montreal premium syrup will run you a couple extra dollars or else you gotta settle for their regular syrup. The premium comes in a ok sized tin dip cup. The place gets packed and isn't even small with front and back outdoor seating a quite a few indoor tables. Service was pretty good but the meal was great. If you can handle a bit of a line, you may be in for a treat here."}
{"text":"Since I read a lot of good things about this place I brought a friend who was from out of town to Faberge.

We walked in mid-week, around 11 AM and the place was half full. Someone quickly told us to pick some seats and we did.... and waited over 20 minutes for someone to come talk to us. Normally this would have been a deal breaker but we were pretty engaged in conversation to feel outraged by this long wait.

Eventually we did get someone to come take our order and I went with their reputed chicken and waffles with some much needed cappuccino. 

CHICKEN N' WAFFLES BABY! 

The food arrived about 25 minutes later. 

So, let's break it down shall we? The chicken was very good, crisp and moist all at the same time. Excellent! However, the waffles were pretty disappointing in comparison as they were very soft, were cold and flavorless. I felt these might not have been as fresh as they should have been.

The maple syrup was authentic, the fruits were fresh/tasty and the potatoes were somewhat OK - I've had far better. The cappuccino wasn't for me. Was it the way it was done? Or I disliked what coffee beans that were used? I wouldn't know, it was pretty bad.

The price tag is a bit steep considering that the meal in globally left a lot to be desired. The service was about average even after the disastrous start. All in all, forgettable.

Was it an off day for Faberge? Possibly. However, I don't see myself coming back and that's why off days can be pretty costly to businesses, in terms of losing clients and more importantly slightly negative reviews that come from them."}
{"text":"Their secret coffee blend is really good. We had a latte and it seriously tasted like chocolate chip cookies!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm!

I love how hip this place is!! You just feel like you're in the heart of the plateau, it's so cozy yet modern. Just loved the atmosphere! They even served gluten free bread!!! ($2 extra)

I also loved how they had child seats that attached to the table. ***MAKE SURE IT'S SECURE BEFORE PUTTING BABY IN THERE!! The first attempt was a fail as the table wasn't very secure to begin with, but we then tried the booth and that worked for us.

We got there at 10am and there wasn't any wait but as we were leaving, there was a lineup out the door!

Their lattes are to DIE for! Their fries are authentic, home made fries. My friend said her french toast was a little too rich so consider yourself warned! 

Overall, it was a memorable experience and above average food and service!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch!  Food was flavorful and the portions were generous!  I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"J'ai adorée mon expérience!
Nous avons pris le classique gaufres/poulet et le pain doré au beurre d'arachide et confiture de fraise. Délicieux!
Le café au lait est très bon aussi."}
{"text":"Excellent food and decent service. I had the chicken and waffle and they were delicious. I tried some of my friend's benny mac and I think it was better though if you want something savoury! I'll be back for that :)"}
{"text":"Ok, so trying to get in for Brunch with a party of 5 at 11:30 am during Osheaga weekend might not be the best time to judge wait times, so I'll give them a pass on the over an hour wait.

Our server was awesome.  Super eager to help and keep us happy.

My family of 5 (including 2 teenagers and a 9-year old) all loved our dishes.  Standouts included the crepes, waffles and mac & cheese!

Close quarters inside, but it is in an older building in Mile End, so to be expected.

Obviously, since they don't take reservations, this is a shot in the dark if you decide to head here before knowing the status of the line, but once you're in, the food and service are great!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Mac and Cheese egg Benedict and the Rustique Benedict. The Mac and cheese one was absolutely amazing! Slightly sweet and an amazing balance of flavor and texture. However, the Rustique came out cold. I sent it back and when I received my next one the egg was over cooked and the English muffin very chewy. Would not recommend that dish at all. We also ordered a hot chocolate that was very yummy. 
The restaurant was very busy and very loud so perhaps the issues I had with my dish were just due to the staff being overwhelmed. I'd try them again if I lived in the area but I don't."}
{"text":"En fait c'est plus un 4.5 mais j'ai beaucoup aimé mon experience. Depuis plus de 6 mois j'essaie d'y aller mais il y a toujours la file et le matin je suis impatiente. Enfin, a 13h30 un samedi, y avait aucune file! 

Nourriture: 4 etoiles, car nos oeufs benedictines n'etaient pas coulant et que j'ai trouvé que l'assiete manquait d'originalité. Pourtant le menu est wow, il y a plein de choses originales a essayer et tout avait l'air savoureux. Les portions sont grosses et c'est pas trop cher pour un brunch tendance dans le Mile- end. On a aussi pris le pain doré aux pacanes: c'etait exeptionnel! 5 etoiles et je suis tres tres difficile pour le pain doré. C'est servis avec du miel et du yogourt nature, nous on a commendé du nutella en plus! 

Service: 5 etoiles, tous le monde est gentil et souriant. 

Ambiance et decors: 5 etoiles, super decor du style Ikea, confortable et originale avec de grosses banquettes pour 6 personnes, comptoirs, terrasse, television. Tres lumineux."}
{"text":"Lovely ambience! A little hot inside but nothing a glass of lychee mamosa can't fix. Chicken and waffles were filling but not as great as the real thing in Los Angeles but the shakshouka was absolutely delicious!
My friend had the nutella crepe with a dash of whipped cream, scrumptious!

Overall, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We had to wait for a while but it was delicious and very satisfying. I ordered Le Massif and it definitely lives up to its name! The ratio of meat to eggs was kind of off (there was a bit too much meat) but all the food on the plate was very good. The jam that it came with was especially yummy on the toast and crepe. The interior of the restaurant was also really trendy and pleasing to the eye, and the waitstaff was very polite. All in all, me and my friends were happy we came here for our last meal in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The breakfast poutine is simply delicious.  I keep telling myself it's so heavy but it's really good!"}
{"text":"Not too bad a wait on a holiday weekend - around half an hour. I had a fantastic latte ($5 for the huge size is really a deal) and the chicken with waffles. I loved the chicken, but the waffles were just meh for me. A little disappointing. My friend's Benny mac was incredible, and she really enjoyed her Caesar, though it's not my jam. Great service, too."}
{"text":"Not the best breakfast we had in Montreal, ordered the egg in a nest, was just ok, but nothing too extraordinary. Don't order the tacos with eggs, the taco was cold and flat, and the eggs weren't much to look at."}
{"text":"Resto Fabergé has many things I love:

- Great Ambiance Love the Artistic Liberty of the place
- Great People, some of the friendliest folks
- Great Food - My parfait was delicious, and my drink was even better
- Amazing terrasse/garden outside
- Turtle Pond

That's right, you lucky Plateau-slash-Mile End ppl who can just hop on over in 5 minutes flat, this is a very relaxed and great place to get your brunch on. I came later on in the afternoon, and got to take a tour of their lovely garden, where they grow much of their own herbs, and mint and I thought it was incredible, coz seriously people, when are you going to get more local than in a restaurant. I got to meet the turtle that lives in its own swimming pond too.

I've heard that if you are looking for a place to do a private party, they can accommodate you as well!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, as they have a good reputation for brunch in Montreal. I got the eggs Benedict served with mushrooms and cheese, and the poached eggs were unfortunately cooked all the way through. We didn't get our coffee till well after our food was served (even though that was the first thing we ordered and we waited a good 20 minutes for our food). Even then, it was impossible to get our waitresses attention for any refills or anything else we needed. My friend got a breakfast plate (and got an upcharge for substituting bacon for sausage... seriously?), and it was mediocre at best. Probably won't be coming back here, especially considering the prices! There are definitely better brunch places with better service and shorter wait times in Montreal..."}
{"text":"Fabergé is almost always busy for brunch. But they said they are open year round except for Christmas! So it's a sure bet during other holidays when you're not sure which places are open. :)

Their brunch items are normally large portions and decadent. My favorite is definitely chicken and waffles! The waffles are nice, soft and buttery. And the fried chicken is juicy and perfectly marinated! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch/lunch place ever! Every time I come to Montreal I have to make a stop otherwise the trip isn't worth ;P

There is almost always going to be a line because it's always busy and the place is a little cramped but it will always be worth it. The servers are adorable, super-friendly and really do care. The space is very cozy albeit a bit tight and it is the most chill place ever. Always check-in for their free _______ (Yelp says soda but their soda machine is broken for now so I got the Rouge smoothie which was delicious!) 

After a night of alcohol and karaoke, I needed something nice and greasy to make me feel better. The last time I was here I ordered a poutine on the side and it was the best poutine I've ever had (sorry not sorry La Banquise) so this time I ordered their Montreal Poutine (8$) in all its fullness but added two sunny side eggs (1$ each) on the side to put on top to make it more breakfasty. Best decision of the morning. It was everything a poutine should be--crispy French fries, topped with a beautiful brown gravy with lots of cheese curds topped with fresh scallions, with additional modification par moi of golden egg. They have a nice list of extras so you can personalize your meal for a couple of bucks. Go ahead! Add a poutine on the side for 3-4$ :) 

I got a good hearty meal for about 11.50$ and I felt like I wasn't paying enough for it. If you're a tourist please come here. If you're a local, you should already know about this place otherwise shame on you!"}
{"text":"Line out the door usually means amazing food (aside from Cora's, which I don't understand why ppl line up for).

We planned to check out L'Avenue but since the wait there was very long, we came to Farberge and I'm glad we did. Although there was a small line, we were able to get seated right away if we took the counter table facing the street. We loved it for the view, sun, and breeze coming through.

The drinks were as expected. Fresh juice, smoothie was a nice blend.

We got the eggs benny over a mac & cheese and the eggs cooked in a cheese bread. Both were a nice twist on classics and had a good assortment of sides (potatoes and fruits). It left you completely satisfied and not bloated feeling.

Would definitely recommend this place but come early!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place with a wide variety of items to choose from. The Huevos Dorados are so so good and very filling. Service was top notch too."}
{"text":"A great place for brunch. My girlfriend and I went here for brunch/lunch. The service was awesome as well as the food. We got there around 11, bit of a line. But only waited about 20 minutes to be seated. The staff were very nice and welcoming. Most try the mimosas."}
{"text":"Vraiment excellent !

Les brunchs sont copieux et pour certains originaux. La carte fait réver et il est dur de choisir ^^
Pour notre part l'assiette le Massif et gauffre et Poulet nous ont enchanté.

Au niveau du cadre du restaurant la déco est sympa et permet d'encore mieux apprécier l'attente avec des TV qui passent des vieux dessins animés :)

On y retournera de sûr pour tester d'autres assiettes."}
{"text":"Par une belle matinée ensoleillée, je me suis rendue sur place pour un petit brunch entre copines. 
Le décor est vraiment chaleureux, agréable et original. Les petites ardoises un peu partout qui décrivent le menu sont bien appréciées. Les banquettes étaient confortables.  

Le service était agréable. Nous avons été servis très rapidement.  La liste des smoothies et des thés donnent envie de tous les essayer.  J'ai fini par commander mon traditionnel earl grey au thé. 
Les thés sont servis dans des bols. Esthétiquement, c'est joli, mais très peu pratique à le tenir car le bol est très chaud. 

Nous avons toutes commandés des oeufs bénédictiennes. Le plat était réussi mais servi un peu froid. Nous avons toutes bien mangé mais ce n'était pas mémorable.  J'y retournerais cependant pour essayer la limonade à la rhubarbe!"}
{"text":"The service and the atmosphere were the best thing about Fabergé. Went to Fabergé expecting it to be amazing because of all the hype, however the food was not as good as I expected. Although the food looks good, it tastes nothing like how it looks.
All the egg benedicts that we had were not runny at all, and we had to replace all the dishes."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday afternoon in a group of 4. The line was already 20 people long by the time we got there. A staff came out to take our names and group size so we could leave the line and pass the time (estimated 1 hour). I think the biggest contributing factor to the wait time is how long it takes the kitchen to serve food. We ordered the chicken and waffles and the benny mac and cheese. Noticing the check in offer on yelp, we also ordered \"sparkling sodas\" which we were told is just pop. A little misleading, if you ask me... Service is just A-Ok. 

The restaurant is decorated nicely in a contemporary style, with simple plastic backed chairs and minimalistic tables. The murals on the walls are pretty cool to look at.

The food itself is good, but not nearly worth the 1 hour wait for table and another 30 minute wait for it to reach our table. Eggs benny is pretty standard but the mac and cheese was too chewy for my taste. The pulled pork was a nice touch and helped cut the heaviness. Portions are fair - I didn't finish the home fries. Chicken was well seasoned but unfortunately there wasn't enough to go with the thick waffles. Worth a visit if the line is short. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I saw that this place was a highly recommended stop on the Montreal breakfast circuit, so I was excited to try. The location is great, and the restaurant itself is adorable. I was, however, very disappointed in the service. We were sat at the window seat and were basically forgotten for quite some time. We sat there for 15 minutes before we were even greeted, and when we were greeted we received a lovely excuse about how our waiter was too busy to help us. Then, I ordered the Burrito Rico and had some questions about questions about some of the ingredients and the \"stand in\" server proceeded to disagree with me about my question. When the food came out, it was AMAZING. When our actual server came, he was very friendly and helpful. Overall, this place is worth the try. A+ for food C- for service."}
{"text":"I loved this place, the food is amazing and prices aren't too high
What really turned me off was when I got the eggs Benedict on English muffin with cheese.
I got cheese that was maybe the size of a quarter, on top of a big English muffin bread. 
I called over the waiter and asked for extra cheese, and she came back saying the kitchen wouldn't give it to her.
I was so incredibly disappointed. I ordered the meal because I wanted the cheese...
It's like ordering a poutine and having a single curd cheese in the hole poutine ."}
{"text":"I really can't say much besides the fact that this food is....AMAZING. I visited from NYC which means I'm familiar with good food. This place, however, knocks out any other brunch spot I've been to. The food hits all of your 5 senses and the vibe is great. I really didn't want to finish my meal because it was that damn good. I wish I could put this place in my pocket and take it back to NYC with me. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. The home fries poutine is the best thing that has ever happened to me. The waffles are killer."}
{"text":"I like this place because the staff are nice and the layout of the room that manages to feel cozy with lots of options for groups of different sizes. The art on the walls and the cartoons on the TVs are uplifting and interesting and busy without being too dizzying when hungover (an important consideration when making a brunch choice.) Their food truck does a delicious pulled pork sandwich. Aside from that I've not yet been blown away by the food. A basic egg and bacon breakfast is over-priced here, and the breakfast poutine, while a yummy novelty, was just too heavy and sticky for me to enjoy past a bite or two. 

I'm glad this place exists, glad there are more brunch options in the area, but have been left unthrilled thus far by the food and coffee itself, or at least by what you get for what you pay."}
{"text":"I went here for poutine week. Their \"people's waffle\" was a very creative take on poutine that did not involve french fries. Delicious. I really like the atmosphere here too -- even though it was relatively packed it wasn't loud. Plus the girl that served me at the bar was really friendly and gracious (hi J :) I can see myself coming back here the next time I'm in Montreal. Their regular menu looked great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Always a favourite of mine for brunch. I had the El Jefe sandwich- egg, bacon, avocado, tomato, lettuce on a brioche bun.  It was delicious! Fantastic crispy bacon. The home fries were perfect. Freshly squeezed orange juice was super-sweet and tasty. The decaf coffee was surprisingly good. Quick, friendly service despite the place being packed! My waitress Janet was lovely, chatty and helpful- perfect for having brunch alone at the bar. Can't fault this experience!"}
{"text":"Apres plusieurs recommandations, nous avons finalement décidé d'essayer le Faberge. La deco est correct, la disposition du resto aussi. Excellent service attentionné et rapide ( matin de semaine ) ma chérie a essayé les oeufs bénédictine ( cuisson parfaite et tres bon gout, la hollandaise etait excellente ) et moi la fameuse poutine matin ( grosse portion de patate maison, excellente hollandaise, oignon, fromage et l'oeuf poche a la perfection ).

Nous y retournerons c'est certain."}
{"text":"Great overall experience. Food: 4, atmosphere:3.5, service:4

We are visiting Montreal for the first time as a family of 4 including 2 young kids (age 3months and 2years). We went in at lunch time with 2 other friends and they had a table for us right away. We were running a bit late and they weren't fussy about it at all. Very accommodating to our kid with readily available crayons and friendly staff to chat with. Good sized bathroom with change table for our little one as well. 

Food was good. We had the chicken and waffles. Chicken was a bit too fried for my liking. Was generous portion but nothing spectacular about it. The cinnamon buttered French toast was delicious.  Not overly sweet. The pouting was ordinary. 

Overall food was good. Service and atmosphere was great. Would definately come back on a weekday as weekends are packed."}
{"text":"There's nowhere quite like fabergé! Whenever I am in town I make an effort to make sure I get there to enjoy a filling and delicious brunch from. While I can attest to the deliciousness of the chicken waffles (I literally get it every time), I can also say that everything else also looks delicious. I drag all my friends and family here and they also love it. You can't go wrong with the creative dishes, great decor and the awesome staff! I also love the mimosas - they are a great price. Would definitely recommend giving this place a try the next time you're in the city!"}
{"text":"Ordered fresh squeeze orange juice, latte, breakfast poutine and Benedictine sud-ouest. The service was nice and really lively ambience. The breakfast poutine was delicious!!!! Definitely will come back and will order chicken with waffle next time !"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles... 'nuff said. Malgré l'attente, Fabergé en vaut la peine. L'ambiance est agréable, les employés sont gentils et en plus tu peux regarder des cartoons en mangeant. Win-win situation!"}
{"text":"Our experience here were horrible, after waiting in line for at least half of an hour, we finally got seated. I got the breakfast poutine and my boyfriend got steak and egg. His asked for medium steak but the steak was burnt. My poutine was very bland in flavour and it was basically just a bowl of potatoes. It was so greasy and lack of flavour so I asked the waiter to take it back. But they refused to do so. I don't get how other people really love the breakfast poutine but I hated it, normally I enjoy poutine as much as anyone in Montreal. Anyways, I won't come to this place ever again"}
{"text":"Brunch has got to be my favorite meal of the day! Especially when there are Mimosas in the mix. Instantly, those two things struck gold for me when I saw their online menu. Plus...there was no way I was gonna leave Montréal and head to NY- without having Crêpes. What???

If you don't mind the lines here, lay low and expect to wait a bit- it's just part of their game plan. But when you head inside though, the place is popping. Layout has all these different seating nooks with Booths and regular tables. And Black outline drawings, decorate their walls and ceiling. 

There's something for everyone here. My Nutella Crêpe was gooey and Chocolatey. While my husband went for a simple Croissant, with eggs and bacon. My Lychee and Passion Fruit Mimosas were equally excellent and unique. Prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of their food. Breakfast was simple and nicely made. Totally cozy spot- Calls for another visit!"}
{"text":"This place had great reviews so we decided to stop in last week. It was crowded on a Friday around noon. We sat down and ordered. Our food took literally an hour to come out, for crepes and French toast. We sat next to two guys (one from cali, the other from Montreal) so it passed the time. The staff was very friendly and nice and the food was good. I didn't order the chicken waffles but they sure seemed good"}
{"text":"Cozy and culturally vibrant atmosphere for Montréal - home and cottage feel with all the locals stuffed in. Loved my Benedict! But, the hot cocoa was over-aestheticized and not as chocolaty as I imagined.."}
{"text":"Chicken Waffles. That is all.

We waited for a table for two for about thirty minutes on a Sunday morning, which isn't as bad as Philly brunch spots. The wait staff was quite enthusiastic. There were a lot of things here that looked instagram worthy, but they're known for their chicken waffles. The portion was massive, and way too much food for early hours of brunch, haha. The fried chicken was perfectly fried, but the waffles were slightly tough (not a problem, that's what syrup is for!) The coffee here is also endless, so that's always a plus.

Definitely worth a stop, especially since they play some old school cartoons (Pinky and the Brain)."}
{"text":"For the hype that was built for it online, I found the food at Faberge to be just mediocre. The restaurant is located in a very cute area in Mile End and the decor inside gives off a cool hipster brunch vibe. The restaurant doesn't take reservations so you will have to wait at least 20 minutes outside if you come for brunch during the weekend. Also, they have free wifi inside which is always good. Now when it comes to food, I ordered the Chicken and Waffle plate (a dish I've had many times before as I previously lived in southern USA)  and was not very impressed. The waffle was a bit cold and the chicken was quite dry. The best part of the dish was the barbecue sauce it was served with, which was delicious, and the potatoes which were well seasoned! My friend ordered the Sante Benedict and liked it but she also ordered a Chai Latte and said it wasn't good at all and tasted like warm milk. Overall, the best part of this restaurant is the casual brunch vibes and the environment rather than the actual food."}
{"text":"SO YUMMY. Came here for brunch on Saturday and loved the neighborhood, vibe and the food. The wait wasn't too bad, since we got here around 2:15pm (can't imagine what the line is like at normal brunch times). 

I ordered the \"le fume\" which was the smoked salmon benedict. It came with several thick slices of smoked salmon and poached eggs on top of cream cheese and 2 halves of a mini Montreal-style sesame bagels, with crispy capers sprinkled on top. It also came with a small side of fruit (mine had pineapple, cantaloupe, orange slices and green grapes) as well as hashbrowns. I also ordered black coffee with steamed almond milk. The only issue I had with my order was that I ordered hollandaise sauce on the side, however the chef poured it on top of my eggs benedict. The waiter was extremely courteous about it though, and asked if I wanted it re-made (I just scraped most of the sauce off and told him it was fine). Overall, the smoked salmon benedict was delicious and extremely filling for $16. I would definitely order it again!

It was difficult to decide on what to order since the menu was so extensive and really everything looked delicious. I think next time I'll try one of their specialty waffles or an omelette. My friends ordered the chicken and waffles (which was HUGE), and she raved about it after. My other friends ordered the mac and cheese benedict special with pulled pork on top, the breakfast poutine special (it's poutine week!) and the breakfast burrito (which was okay but not great). 

They charge you extra for sides of almond milk ($1 per small pot) so make sure you don't ask for too many. 

Overall, my bill came to $21 with tax and tip, which is a little on the pricey side for lunch, but definitely worth it for the food and atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"About a 30 minute wait, another 30 minutes to get our food, and in the end it was just average, not sure what the hype is about. The orange juice was good though."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is definitely one of my favourite brunch places in Montreal. Maybe it was because I was not expecting anything, maybe because I was hungry but I can clearly say that the food was top quality and it was very tasty.  The service was very friendly.  Needless to say I will be back."}
{"text":"Il parait que Fabergé est une institution à Montréal et qu'il y a toujours une attente énorme... et bien pas lors de ma visite. De ce fait j'ai beaucoup plus apprécié l'expérience. Bon pour être honnête nous sommes passés pas loin lors d'une balade et il y avait du monde dehors et sur le trajet retour il n'y avait personne devant.
On a donc décidé de tester leur fameux brunch. 


Première impression : le lieu est sympa mais un peu bruyant quand il y a beaucoup de monde. En tout cas il y a une armée d'employé présent pour vous éviter de trop attendre. On nous a installés à 3 sur une large banquette et je dois avouer que nous avions de la place. 
Pour ce qui est du repas j'ai décidé de prendre une omelette et c'est là que je suis moins satisfait de mon expérience. C'était bon mais sans plus, coté  quantité je pense que ce n'était pas le plat le plus garni. En plus de cela le prix n'était pas non plus des plus compétitifs mais je peux dire que j'ai testé. Pas sûr par contre que ça devienne mon brunch quotidien..."}
{"text":"Apres avoir consulté la lite de commentaires incroyables, nous y sommes allés mon copain et moi pour bruncher un dimanche matin (midiyish) ! 

Sans dire que j'ai été déçud, disons seulement que je m'attendais à la crème de la crème des déjeuners! nous sommes arrivés et nous avons du attendre 30 minutes pour une table alors j'etais vraiment excitee d'essayer ce nouveau restaurant-la! 

D'abord, l'endroit est très bruyant! Vas pas la pour parler intime avec ton amoureux, tu vas etre déçu! Ensuite, le menu est varié et propose des choix qui sortent du traditionnel deux oeufs bacon, comme la gaufre aux poulets frits ou encore le bénédictine mac and cheese (soit les deux plats que nous avons essayés)! L'assiette est vraiment super et il manque vrmt pas de bouffe, mais, à mon goût à moi, il manque de goût! les plats goûtent rien ! J'ai vraiment été surprise parce qu'on s'entend, c'pas tous les jours que tu manges une croquette de mac'n'cheese pour déjeuner! 

Bref, je trouve encore qu'il y a des restaurants à déjeuner qui se démarquent plus et le Fabergé est loin en liste de top-brunch!"}
{"text":"Trying to decide where to go for brunch in Montreal is impossible. Okay, okay, that's a little dramatic, let's go with extremely difficult. The options are endless and I was getting in a tizzy trying to decide which brunch place to try out. After much debate, we settled on Fabergé.

We came on a Tuesday and arrived just before 11:00am. There was already a lineup inside (Montrealers don't mess around) but by the time we settled into our seats, the line stretched out the door. Crazy. Tip: make sure your whole party is there, otherwise they won't sit you.

The vibe is chic but laid back. Love how there were 90's cartoons playing in the background. Talk about nostalgia. Even though the place is close quarters, there still is room to breath.

Menu is broken down into sweets (crepes, french toast and waffles), benedicts, sandwiches, omelettes and eggs.

- S'mores waffles ($14.00) - holy cow, this was awesome! I thought it would be way too sweet for my liking but everything was well balanced. Gooey marshmallows, nice crunch from the graham crackers and a generous dose of nutella.

- Le massif ($16.00) - the sides were completely forgettable. I wouldn't even waste stomach space eating those baked beans, blah. The rest was pretty standard fare and didn't have me jumping out of my seat like the s'more waffle. I liked the small cup of fruit.

This place is hip and popular. Personally, I wouldn't be willing to wait with a line running out the door but I can see why people would like it."}
{"text":"I love chicken and waffles but was really disappointed with their version...the people who rave about it clearly haven't had it the way it should be! The waffle was soggy and tough, the chicken had a nice crust but wasn't salted and was gross dark meat (without the fat trimmed - so why charge $16?!). The \"BBQ sauce\" was unpleasantly bitter and the coleslaw was a miss too (no loss since it was only 2 bites worth in little metal side dish). -1 more star for charging $2 extra for real maple syrup ;( which I later regretted because nothing could have saved the plate! With that said the service was really great and my friend enjoyed her French toast. If they could ditch the BBQ/coleslaw and just include maple syrup and white meat instead it would be worth ordering!"}
{"text":"La récolte by Terra Perma was an amazing night hosted by this restaurant. It was a private event and we had to share our tables with two lovely ladies. 

Together, we tried out different food and we had a blast laughing and joking together. The food is amazing... I dont remember all the foods they serve us(there were so many; fried fiddleheads, cheddar cheeses, marinated mushroom...) and the service took some time but the company we had was so great that we literally didn't mind waiting.  

Overall, I had such a blast. Definitely, an event for the foodie. It is definitely a place to go to try out the food. Beware, it may takes some time so bring good company!"}
{"text":"I went to Fabergé a couple of times and was always left a little disappointed. I always check yelp before going to a restaurant and Fabergé's rating sets the tone for an amazing experience. However once there it failed to impress me and to meet my expectations. Surely it has a diversified menu and serves good food but nothing new or original that differentiates him from other average brunch places in Montreal serving Benedict's, omelettes, french toast and pancakes. Good food in general and affordable nevertheless."}
{"text":"Small portions and almost an hour wait, decor was nice but seating was very tight. The potatoes were amazing, everything else was average, wished the sizes were bigger. Walked across the street to fairmount bagel because we were still hungry afterwards. They were also selling fairmount bagels but for $2 instead of $1 originally. Don't think I would wait to try this place again"}
{"text":"Very nice brunch spot! Worth the wait....excellent service! 

Couldn't decide between the chicken waffles and huevos rancheros so I managed to convince my friend to exhange/share!

Chicken waffles won!"}
{"text":"Just one word: Amazing. It's a cute small place, with nice music, very good and friendly service, very delicious food! I got the eggs in a nest, which is toasted bread with cheese, and in the middle there are the over easy eggs. It comes with potatoes and fruits on the side. I'd for sure recommend here! I'm a fan now that I tried the Faberge breakfast, and looking forward to try their other breakfast plates. My friend got the chicken and waffle, and my second try I'd get waffles, they look delicious and was very tasty!

P.S. I'd say go their at a nice time, either early, or around 12.30ish so that you don't wait in line"}
{"text":"I guess i found my new brunch place in Montreal!
Seriously this place is offering really nice choices, their specialities are awesome and the price is reasonable for the quality.
We were there for the Mothers Day and for big group i suggest you to get there early.

I tried the Benny Mac...wow! Fried mac n cheese cubes with a poached egg on top and a nice touch of relish, the mix is simply DELICIOUS! I need to come back for that.

The next speciality is the Chicken waffle a classic American dish. I only tasted the fried chicken and i have to admit the crispy and the seasoning was on point.
I didn't have the chance the eat the combination of chick and waffle but next time for sure.

The only bad comment i have is about the Steak and egg. The steak was cooked too medium, too bad.

Overall great place to discover if you haven't yet

Conclusion: I'm coming back!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the best omelette ever yesterday in the sun and on the street. Going back in the rain this morning for the Eggs Rustique. Staying in this part of town at an airbnb I would not consider any other place for breakfast. All good."}
{"text":"Really cool brunch place on St Laurent. I had the Benny Mac = poached egg with hollandaise on deep fried Mac and cheese patties. This was a really nice twist on the classic Benny. I'm not really a Benny tradionalist but if you are maybe this brunch would be offensive. I loved it. The Mac and cheese patty was fried well, crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside. The egg yolk saturated the deep fried Mac and cheese while eating and made it even better. My only feedback would be to add a tad more flavour to the Mac and cheese. Though the jalapeño jelly was a nice addition, could be spicier though. Comes with home fries and bowl of fruit. Overall really fun brunch in a cool setting. Would defiinitely go back to try other items."}
{"text":"Nous étions aller pendant la semaine et pourtant c'était rempli, le seul avantage c'est que nous n'avons pas fait de line-up. Les repars sont succulents, l'ambiance est conviviale et les serveurs sont très sympas. 
Je retournerai sans doute !!"}
{"text":"Although the wait can be long at times, when I went there was no line. We got seated right away and the staff was super friendly. I would highly suggest eating here if and when you visit Montreal. My friends and I ordered different plates and they were all amazing. My favorite out of the four dishes I tried was the Benny Mac. I still dream about it till this day. I also recommend the chicken and waffles! The crepes are whatever."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit pour un brunch le dimanche matin. Pour éviter la file il vaut mieux arriver avant 11h. Malgré ça nois n'avons pas attendu plus de 10min. Le service est très bon ainsi que la Poutine déjeuner! Demandez une table loin de la porte pour ne pas avoir le courant d'air à chaque que quelqu'un rentre ou sort."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! For the price you are getting a lot in value. My husband and I ordered the chicken waffles and eggs on a nest for brunch and we were pleasantly surprised!
The first dish came with four huge pieces of chicken thighs, slightly friend where the meat is thick and still juicy on the inside, the batter was thin and did I not leave an oily after-taste. Waffles were so fluffy!  The second dish was also tasty, not sure the cheesy bread that came with it was a bit stale. We ordered pulled pork on the side and were surprised at the very generous portion (only for $3!)."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing!  We had a little wait (maybe 30 minutes) but I think that may be light for this place.  It was really hip inside and the wait staff was super trendy.  The place was insane busy so the drinks and food  took awhile but once we got it, the taste was so amazing it completely negated the wait!  Love this place"}
{"text":"TLDR: Best brunch spot in Montreal.

I'm very familiar with Fabergé, because I was fortunate to have them in my university building in my last year of university. They no longer have an express spot there, but I make a point to go to their restaurant on Fairmount at least once a year, which is not something I do for most places.

I can attest to a third of the menu, and tell you that it's all delicious. If you order one of their heavier dishes just get their green smoothie to even it all out. The ginger is very refreshing.

They also make the best poutines for Poutine week, so make sure to go and taste their concoction. Their regular house breakfast poutine is also fantastic. 

The servers are the nicest people in all the Montreal's restaurants and are very knowledgeable about the menu. Enjoy their food at a table, booth, or even the bar. You will have a great time no matter what you choose."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles, CHICKEN AND WAFFLES!

The definite staple of this restaurant has to be its chicken and waffles. For me, its been super hard to find around Montreal (particularly near downtown) so this would have to be my go-to place. Personally, I felt that the chicken was amazing but was left a little bit disappointed with the sides and waffles. 

The service was great and its honestly a great spot for brunch at reasonable prices. Definitely check it out if you haven't and don't be afraid to explore their other menu options (I heard the eggs benedict were delicious)."}
{"text":"Better than just an average breakfast/brunch spot. There can be quite a line even early in the morning but it's worth it for their breakfast creations. I tried the delice French toast and that was fluffy and filling but a little too sweet in the center since all the sugars and cinnamon was in the middle. We also tried poutine for breakfast and their poutine is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Great place. Delicious food, the staff and the service has been the best we have encountered thus far. I would def recommend this place, and will come back when I visit Montreal again. They have an outside seating area in the back, which is peaceful and beautiful. You must try the melon, lemonade jalapeño juice. It is fresh and spicy in such a refreshing way. A must!"}
{"text":"Always crowded. Always friendly staff that try to make your life easy. Always phenomenal food. I have to admit that the coffee and how good it was, defied my expectations from a brunch place. ( so much better than I thought it'd be)
I've tried their rusty omelette and liked it. My family has also tried their chicken waffles (so surprisingly awesome), their poutine and Smokey omelette. Their poutine, in my opinion, is the best I've ever tried in Montreal!"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker coming into Montreal, I didn't quite know what to expect in terms of quality of food here. My friend and I are both huge brunchers, if I may, and we were blown away by this place. 

We were seated immediately on a Saturday, during prime brunch time. The interior is really cool and fun, and they play cartoons on the screens, which I think is a cute touch. My friend and I agreed that the spot is reminiscent of the many Brooklyn brunch spots. 

As for the food, I can confidently say, the eggs benedict I had here are the best I've ever had. They were SO full of flavor and I only wish it was never-ending. We had the chicken and waffles, which were quite good and the home fries that accompanied it were delicious and seasoned well. The plates also came with a nice small bowl of fruit, balancing out the dish well. The only disappointing part was my matcha latte. It was essentially milk with a slight matcha taste - but our server/bartender was more than happy to add more matcha to it. 

To top it all off, our server was amazing! He was so nice, friendly, extremely accommodating and even recommended great places to visit and go out in Montreal for a good time. Will definitely be back the next time I visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The customer service is always beyond amazing. The staff is really great. The food is delicious and it's worth the wait for brunch. It's a MUST if you're in Montreal. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had been to Fabergé once before thanks to a Yelp event, and had the occasion to sample their chicken and waffles, which i was told are good. So I was up for something new and greasy this time.

The breakfast poutine seemed just too greasy, and I was not feeling the healthy option of spinach omelet. I found my fit in the rustique benedict eggs (eggs, english muffins, sauce along with mushrooms, with potatoes and fruit of course). Everything was good, but cold. Cold potatoes, cold muffins.. I have no brunch luck! Still the potatoes were good, so were the eggs - although one was runny, the other cooked through. I decided to go all in, and ordered a lavender latte. That I could not recommend. It's served in a mason jar - Pinterest friendly! But it's a lot of latte and no coffee at all. For $6 I wouldn't bother.

Some stars are missing because of that, and the very small space. The waiter looked baffled that my friend and I arrived separately, so I was parked in front of the door for a bit, in front of empty tables. Thankfully I was seated, or should I say neatly folded? It's really cramped guys. A family was next to us, and I pretty much became a member right then and there."}
{"text":"I recently went to this place for the first time on my Birthday (February 14th, 2016) for breakfast/brunch with my sisters. I would advise anyone going, to show up preferably as early as possible to avoid waiting in the long line that files outside the door and onto the sidewalk, it was honestly crazy to see. This place has received A LOT of hype and i'd very much like to set the record straight for any newbies thinking about going there. The place itself is cool, the way its set up. It's quite indicative of a classic Montreal Plateau breakfast hub with its hipster vibe. The service was by far worthy of a five star review. From beginning to end, we felt taken care of, the staff was very friendly, they joked with us about how we didn't eat our fruits, and refilled the waters without us having to even ask. Considering the place was packed, I was extremely impressed by the personalized service. The food however is kind of where this place falls flat. The menu has a fun selection of interesting plates like chicken and waffles, and a fried mac and cheese pulled pork eggs benedict. The problem is that for the above average price your paying combined with the hype surrounding this place, you're expecting this breakfast to be one of the best breakfast's you've ever had, when in reality, although the plates are pretty, the food doesn't taste at all memorable. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict is unfortunately flavourless, not thick enough, and there's just not enough on your plate. I had the El Jeffe sandwich but the guacamole inside also seemed to lack a real kick. All in all this place was a 3.25 stars out of 5. I'll probably go back some day, but there's definitely much better in the area for the same price if you really want an incredibly breakfast experience."}
{"text":"First time there a few weeks ago, went there with a date under strong recommendations from friends of mine. 

Even if the food was good, the service was so awful, I'll never go back.

We spoke to our waitress twice, once to order and once to pay. 

We didn't get our full order, mine was missing sirup, my date's was missing her toast. 

Every time we managed to make eye contact with anyone, they'd turn away, as if they were trying to avoid us. We were able to grab a busboy at some point and asked him for our missing stuff, which we ended up never getting. 

It was a busy day, but they definitely weren't understaffed (I saw at least 3 waitresses and 2 bussboys).

15 minutes later, we were done with our meal, our waitress asked us if everything was good. We told her in the most polite way possible about the missing stuff and the fact that we might have liked to order something else to drink during our meal. What we got as a response was: \"Sorry about that, that'll be $35,63\".

I've worked in bars and restaurants, this is not how you treat customers. I don't know about you, but paying for stuff I didn't get is pretty high on the list of things I hate, right under s#itty customer service.

One gesture from our waitress would have turned this one star review to a 4 star one with recommendations to all my friends. Oh well."}
{"text":"There will be a line up when if you don't get here early! My boyfriend and I arrived just before noon and the wait time was about 45 minutes, however it is TOTALLY WORTH IT!! They have a few mimosa options I had the lychee mimosa and let me tell you it was so good, I had 3! My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles and I never seen him eat so fast before. I had the mac benny which is what they are known for. Instead of having your traditional English muffin it's deep fried mac and cheese with pulled pork, it was delicious. If you come here during the busy time and plan on having mimosas my tip for you is to order more than 1 at a time because the service can be a bit slow however the staff is so nice and pleasant to deal with. The space is small inside you are extremely close to the people sitting next to you so if you're expecting to have a quiet brunch this is not the place. Enjoyed my meal here and definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Coffee is free, the service is fast and nice and the food is ok. Maybe too crowded, the tables are so close that you can't move without ask sorry.
Btw the place is nice and my french toast are very good."}
{"text":"Great brunch place to go with a group of friends! Lots of incredibly delicious dishes."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for good food... I recommend! It's a little loud and very packed so if you're looking for something chill this isn't the place!
Our server, Samuel was very accommodating and took very good care of us...a little intense as he declared and I agree, but all good!"}
{"text":"This was our second time coming to this place and it was just as great as last time! They're drinks are amazing and the food is so fresh. I would recommend this place to anyone. It's a bit crammed, so if you're coming with a larger group it's harder to get a table"}
{"text":"I am not a fan that half of party (2 people) have arrived few minutes early and asked to wait until full party arrived to be seated. Will never come again"}
{"text":"I'll be honest...it's been two months since I was in montreal for my friend's bachelorette but I'm still thinking about the amazing brunch experience we had at Faberge. It was hard picking a brunch spot out of the TONS of recommendations. The wait was about 20 minutes and it went by much quicker than I would have expected. We got a table in the patio/garden in the back...SUCH a cute area (and the perfect sunshiney weather just added to it.) I was super impressed with our waiter and the general service. He remembered every tiny detail (like what condiments to bring on the side) of a group of 9 demanding ladies. It was a little annoying that they charged extra for every condiment (like maple syrup...) I think what makes me rate this place a five stars is definitely because of the service. 

Some of us split dishes, got our own and also ordered a bunch for the table to share. My favorites were: 1) the chicken and waffles..the combination of the flavorful chicken and freshly made waffles was just exquisite. 2) The Shakshouka..again super flavorful. Some of the best i've ever had, definitely had a kick with out going overboard. 3) Crepe at the end was amazing...bananas, strawberries, nutella. Friends were very happy with their omelettes/scrambled eggs filled with veggies and egg burrito.  My cappucino didn't seem strong enough but who knows... I'd still recommend this place to out of towners =)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Very impressed. 
When you ask to replace potatoes with a salad it's $2 extra but you get a beautiful big salad with many vegetables and a great dressing. 
There is a terrace outside in nice weather. Usually there is a line but if you go early enough or as a couple, you can often get a table."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant dans le mile end spécialisé dans les déjeuners se retrouvent dans tous les sites et possède une excellente réputation. J'ai trouvé l'établissement charmant, des banquettes confortables, une décoration simpliste. Le menu est complet il y a des choix pour tous les goûts et en effet les plats sont généreusement garnis la moitié de l'assiette consiste en pommes de terre, remplissant mais gras. On a une petite coupe de fruits pour passer le tout. Le goût du café filtre moyen. On trouve facilement mieux. J'ai pris un sandwich oeuf BLT. Déçue de constater qu'il était servi sur du pain toasté et non un bagel frais.... Ont une terrasse ou il fait bon de s'installer par beau temps. En gros on mange correctement mais on ne nous surprend pas!"}
{"text":"I love Mile End. So many great restaurants, and Faberge is one of them. Came on a weekday around 11am just in time for brunch, so we beat the hectic lunch hour. Cool mix of modern decor and hipster peeps, Captain Planet playing on the flat screens. I honestly came here for the cool latte art, but the food was just as good!  had salmon eggs benedict that came w/ a side of fruit, potatoes, & also ordered waffles w/ jam/whipped cream. Wish we tried a smoothie cause I think it was named after Celine Dione, haha. We also saw so many people ordering the breakfast poutine which looked amazeballz. This place hit the spot preparing us for a day of exploring Mile End."}
{"text":"A cute little breakfast place located in this part of town. They offer quite a variety of breakfast/brunch options so I am sure you can easily find something that you want to eat. I thought the portions was more than enough and ended up sharing my plate. I was craving sweets that morning and ordered a nutella crepe while my boyfriend had the egg benedicts.

You can't go wrong with a nutella crepe. It tasted so good with my coffee plus it kept me energetic for the rest of the day. There was a bowl of fruits as a side to make me feel somewhat healthy. The egg benedicts were also cooked right with a side of your choice of sausages and fruits. Overall, I had a good time here and recommend you to check it out!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. It had taken over as my number one brunch spot. Many different options on menu. I love their juices and smoothies! Anything on the menu is amazing just go!"}
{"text":"This was my third time at Fabergé and every time was a charm. It wasn't too busy as I was there with a friend on a Wednesday morning but as soon we left the place was filling up quickly. I order huevos  dorados  (delicious) and my friend got the classique. It was her first time and she enjoyed it. It took us a good 15 mins before ordering because we want it everything."}
{"text":"As always, Fabergé never disappoints for brunch.

Food - First we cashed in on our free drink offer from yelp - A berry smoothie and drip coffees. For food we ordered the Meat Eater and the Eggs Benny special. The Mac and Cheese Benedict had fried Mac and cheese as the base instead of English muffin, pulled pork, poached egg and hollandaise. As with their other brunch options, it came with fruit and potatoes. This eggs Benny was UNREALLLL -- Definitely the right call this morning. 

Service - When we first got there the service felt a little disorganized. The food arrived before we even got our coffees and smoothie. Towards the end they were quick to refill coffees and check up on us."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have about this place is the wait. There was a 15-20 minute in line, followed by a 30+ minute wait for the food. The servers/waiters were really courteous and apologized/explained the delays to us.

We ordered the breakfast poutine (4/5) and mont royal burger (5/5), both of which I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not only is Fabergé's food delicious, they're also super Yelp friendly. I checked in at brunch and to my surprise, an offer came up for a free non-alcoholic drink. Love it!

All in all, this is probably one of my favourite brunch spots. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is great - don't know what else to say... everything is just spot on."}
{"text":"Brunch is one of the best ways to enjoy a lazy weekend morning and in Montreal there are plenty of brunch places at your disposal.  Fabergé, located in Mile End, is one of them and it is a quite popular one too.  Even if you show up early the line-up can be quite long.  We were three and it was a good 45 minutes before we got seated and we showed up around 10ish.

Once inside the space is cozy and inviting.  They have some funky art on the wall and TVs playing cartoons.  We were seated in a booth which was pretty comfortable.

The menu is pretty large and varied here so you're likely to find something for all tastes.  Since they are known for chicken and waffles it made sense to get that.  The food came really quickly and it was time to dig in.  The fried chicken was well-seasoned, crispy on the outside yet moist and juicy on the inside however the waffles left a lot to be desired.  They were too dense, lacking crispness and in general a little on the dry side.  When compared to the fried chicken it was a bit of a letdown.  This dish also came with a side of breakfast potatoes which were okay but not the best I ever had.

I'm a little on the fence about what to think of the prices.  My plate was $16 and I did get a huge portion but like I said the dish was really hit and miss which makes me lean toward thinking it is overpriced.  My latte though was much more reasonably priced and the quality was good for a brunch place.

Was the 45 minute wait justified?  I don't think so.  If you are going to make someone wait that long for their food then it better be pretty tasty but my meal missed the mark.  I would be inclined to come back and try other items on the menu but only if there wasn't as long a line-up as there was when I visited."}
{"text":"Coup de cur intense! Ambiance trop bien pour déjeuner ou bruncher entre amis. On a le choix d'être assis dans un \"booth\" ou une table. Les murs sont décorés par une immense murale qui se propage jusqu'au plafond. Le menu est vaste, on y retrouve du sucré comme du salé. J'ai personnellement eu de la difficulté à choisir! Pour ceux qui on des enfants pas de problème, le dessin animé Adventure Time passe en boucle sur un écran!"}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere, quaint and friendly staff! Great little sidewalk terasse. 

Wasn't quite sure what I wanted but my waitress made a suggestion in which was simple \"2 eggs in a nest\" what ending in being a delicious choice as simple as it sounds it was. The cheese bread the eggs were set in was super fresh! The  cappuccino was as delicious as it was presented.
I unfortunately couldn't take advantage of the Elite event the week before but happy to have caught up and tried Faberge!
Can't wait to return for a Sunday Brunch!

Note: Although Faberge was packed the noise level was reasonable."}
{"text":"Super cute place with a very chic and clean interior. All staff seem happy and are engaged. The food is thoughtful and creative, and delicious. I eat here when travelling for work. It's difficult to eat well in the road but there are plenty of options here. Coffee is seriously good too."}
{"text":"It's an average brunch place. You wait outside in line for like half an hour, the space is full of people and really loud, service is kind of slow but that's not the servers' fault... The food was okay, we all order specialties (they have a legend in their menu) and they were good, the Chicken and Waffles was the best dish of all of them, the rest (french toast, cubano sandwich, blueberry bacon waffles) wasn't bad but also no wow factor. Still on the look out for a brunch place I'll love."}
{"text":"I have been here before with my boyfriend long back for waffle and chicken and he loved it. Now had poutine and my sister had burrito, both was good! I love the vanilla milkshake too. Did a check in and they gave me this berry smoothie !!!"}
{"text":"Belle petite place à déjeuner dans le Mile-End, plusieurs choix d'oeufs, crêpes, bénédictines, ...***Les utilisateurs de ''Yelp'' faisant leurs ''check-in'' ici, reçoivent une boisson non-alcoolisé gratuite, bon pour exemple, un café filtre (1.50$) ou encore un smoothie vert (6$)***. J' y retourner probablement pour essayer encore une fois leur carte déjeuner. Wifi gratuit pour travailler sur travailler."}
{"text":"I liked the free smoothie I unlocked with Yelp, before then they were offering sparkling soda, but smoothie is actually better! I wanted to come try Fabergé because of its incredible fame, big lineups in the weekend that never end, it's quite insane. I went on a Monday morning and there was still a small lineup. Didn't get the terrace table and the inside is quite hot, but it wasn't that much of an issue.

In terms of the food, I find that Fabergé is actually not as fancy as I thought, but the taste of the dishes we ordered was fairly good. I took the popular chicken waffle plate, amazing spicy chicken but waffle is average, the portion is incredibly big and I had a hard time finishing it. My friend tried their Boston French toast, quite good but much smaller than my plate. They put dark chocolate on top of the French toast, it's actually quite intensely savoury. I like the brunch but I would think twice to return because of the wait time."}
{"text":"This is really a lovely place!! My friend took me here for brunch today. We set next to the bar. It was a little bit crowded, but the ambiance was quite good. The barista is so kind! I ordered a cup of latte and a classic Benedict eggs. They were both really tasty!!! I can't wait to go back there someday!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and the cocktails are amazing too. The servers and everyone behind the bar are absolutely wonderful and such beautiful people! Thank you for being awesome and making my trip to Montréal so great, so glad I found this gem of a place. Everyone needs to try the bourbon lemonade and the french toast! Hope to meet you guys again soon"}
{"text":"My first review was not very good. 

The owner (Echo) invited me through Yelp messaging to come back which I refused because I never want to take a free meal just because of a bad review... I feel like it would be taking advantage of Yelp for personal gain. However I thought it was a very nice gesture from the restaurant and I did go back. 

I am happy to report that the second time was way better. I had the chicken and waffles again... so good! All the food we had was delicious and very fresh. Thank you to the owner for the kind offer. I will be back again and again.

Service was friendly and efficient.

Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Damned ! Une pépite à Montréal :) Un accueil chaleureux, des plats gargentuesques, une qualité au rdv (la poutine matin est une vraie tuerie !). Une de mes places préférées où il faut quand même braver un certain temps d'attente. La rançon du succès !"}
{"text":"La petite découverte pendant le dayoff, et une belle découverte. La place est super mignonne chaque objets est en harmonie avec le mood ambiant :)

Passons aux choses sérieuses, la bouffe! 
J en ai pris pleins la bouche (sans mauvais jeu de mots), les ufs bénédictines santé, sont tout de même cochons, mais c est ça qu'on aime !"}
{"text":"I've seen a few photos popping up of people having fun at this place on my Instagram. That raised me the desire to go there. I finally was just strolling at Mile-End and I saw a small line in front of this place and raised my curiosity even more. 

I deduced to give it a try and voilà! The menu is pretty common area, but I am mesmerized by rest. All the details... the decorations, the servers, how everything is taken care of. It just worth the experience. I've met the sweetest waitress ever. Too bad I have the bad habit of forgetting things and I forgot her name. Sorry, my bad. 

I had a Rosy fog, which is a London Fog (tea) flower flavoured. It is served in a small mason jar and it comes with flowersssss. So sweet and romantic. But don't order it if it's your first date: the small pieces of petals sticks to your teeth. LOL. 

Brunch is very well served (as usual) and I shared with my better half S2. We were very satisfied. 

A brunch and experience that are a must for foodies."}
{"text":"Stop what you're doing! Check in with yelp and get a free drink! I got the green smoothie and it was delicious...in fact all the food is very good and reasonably priced compared to most brunch places. The downside is that the service is SLOW. It's nice for a leisurely brunch with lots of chatter but if you come hungry, you will become hangry. I had the club sandwich which was really good and came with a large side of salad and hashbrowns. 
Overall I recommend this place...but with the usual line to get in and the snails pace service, it won't be a short meal."}
{"text":"If I would have rated this place a month or 2 ago I would have given it 5 (and more if I could) stars. It seems they are going trough some changes. The portion  gotten a little smaller but they are still big enough. The menu gotten smaller (less options) but you can still find a lot of great stuff. So what is my problem ? They used to have a vegan option, change the eggs omelet into a hummus based omelet which is vegan friendly...well not anymore. This was the reason we went there (my girlfriend is vegan) and not L'Avenue for example. Now its almost the same, huge lines, fancy food (which is a bit pricey) and NO vegan options. I hope they will change it soon, nevertheless I still found the food tasty and like the place."}
{"text":"Brunch très prisé en fin de semaine à 12h, nous avons attend 45 min pour avoir une table de 4 personnes. Les smoothies proposés sont originaux.
Les assiettes sont bien remplies et très bonnes."}
{"text":"N'importe quel resto qui accommode un grand group sans réservation en pleine heure du brunch se méritent des belles étoiles! On était un group de 8 et la moitié sont arrivé un bon 30 minutes en retard, mais on ne nous a pas fait sentir mal de ne pas avoir une table complète et on a même pris soin de nous pour les cafés en attendant. Le déjeuner comme tel, la poutine matinale bien sûr, était pas mal bonne. La seule chose que j'ai regrettée était de ne pas avoir demandé l'extra bacon que mon amie avait pris. Aussi, j'étais super contente de voir une offre check-in pour une boisson non-alcoolisée gratuite! Un gros merci pour le bon latte! Les autres déjeuner avaient aussi l'air délicieux (poulet et gaufres, crêpes, oeufs bénédictines, etc.) et le décor et l'ambiance sont à la fois funky et confortable. Parfait pour un matin de fin de semaine de paresse!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles. Nuff said. 

Never had this combination and it might sound weird but this duo is amazinggg. They give you super big portions--it could feed two people and it's so delicious! The chicken is crispy and well spiced and the waffles are soft! They also give a variety of sauces to put on top so if you're the savoury type of person--you can put sriacha or chilli sauce or if you were craving something more sweet--like me, I put syrup on top. I know it sounds gross to put syrup on fried chicken but surprisingly, it was really good with the waffles! You can eat them separately of course, but just try eating it together at least once--makes the experience! Also, I stole a bite out of my friends Smoked Salmon Eggs Benny and that hollandaise sauce was 10/10 and they give you a good portion size of salmon unlike some other brunch places where you can barely even taste the salmon.

Definitely coming back and trying their Benny Mac  :D

ps: they have free wifi and sometimes they have cool yelp check-in offers which are free!"}
{"text":"Although the place was short staffed today, I really enjoyed coming here for brunch!

The menu offers many sweet and savory meals along with drinks and snacks. 

I had their two eggs omelette and it was quite filling! With my YELP app, I was able to get a free non-alcoholic drink and I got a green smoothie (which coincidently happened to cost the most!)

Thoroughly happy with the service and food and so excited to come back again! I love the \"hipster\" feel of this breakfast lounge and everything is super affordable for the portion you get!"}
{"text":"I ordered Eggs Benedict & they were sooooo good! Comes with a side of fresh fruits, which I totally loved. The ambience is lovely, service was good, I don't think I can find any negatives with this place.
I took a star off coz it's a little pricey but that won't stop me from visiting this gem again!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! Service was great!!
Only downside is that our whole group of 8 girls ended up with diarrhea right after :-/
Gotta say it was worth it though! That Benny Mac was insanely good!"}
{"text":"Came by this place because a friend of mine been before and  recommended it. I'm glad we listened to her. She said there would be a long line up and is better to go earlier in the morning. We went around 9am I think and there was no line. Inside is very chic and instagram worthy. Service was great and if you check in on Yelp, they give you a free pop! I didn't really know what to order and I was looking online at their menu to decide earlier. Opted for the default breakfast plate with bacon eggs, toast and the potato. Not sure what it was.. because like. It's such a basic breakfast plate but it was really good. I think my favourite was probably the potato pieces. It looked burnt but it was the seasoning that was on it that was more darker. It just had a lot of flavour to it. The eggs were the way I liked it and the toast was good too. I like to put the eggs, bacon together between toast to make a nice sandwich - just gets a little messy if you get sunny side eggs, ha!

Overall, great vibes, great food, great service. Will def come back again when I'm ever in the area for breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"My go to spot, absolutely in love with this place and it's staff."}
{"text":"We heard of this place a long time ago but just never had the courage to wait in line to just get brunch. Surprisingly, we got there at 11am on a Saturday and we got seated right away! 

The menu is very straight forward with a lot of original combinations. We got the eggs benedict served on top of pulled pork and a mac and cheese bun! It was accompanied by these unbelievable breakfast potatoes. The eggs were really heavy, I think things would taste better if they had some sort of pop somewhere. But anyways, I still think that it tasted really good. I got the El jefe, I'm not too impressed because it's just a burger bun with an egg, bacon and guacamole. And it's really messy to eat since the eggs just breaks down. My husband just love breaking yolks so he devoured most of the sandwich. 

However, although we got seated right away, it took them almost an hour for us to get our food, but luckily we got to sip on our beautiful cappuccino with a leaf coffee art. My husband got the matcha latte and it's so pretty! And really good too!

We are looking forward to come back again and try their chicken waffle! But maybe not come on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"Fabergé is very popular. Every day around noon there's a line up to enter. The place is popular because the food is good and a little bit special. They have specialties that other breakfast restaurant doesn't have. Also they have diner if you don't want to have a breakfast."}
{"text":"I call this a hidden gem.  After trekking across town to find it (if you blink you might miss it) I was surprised to find a cute, urban chic interior with fantastic food.

You walk in through purple velvet curtains into a white interior filled with abstract paintings in black and gold of the city of Montreal.  Kind of cool, gaudy, hipster all at the same time.  I've now been there 4 times and keep coming back.

Favorites: breakfast poutine.  It's on the specials list or you can ask for it.... but it's amazing!  egg, sausage, cheese, gravy (I know I'm missing some ingredients)... etc.  surprisingly filling but amazing flavor!

I love their french toasts with the yummy fruits and the options of toppings.
They even have a honey and plain yogurt dip on the side allowing you to get just enough sweet and still call it breakfast.

Their special french toast is made with cinnamon danish and topped with fresh fruit.  I stayed away the first few times thinking it would be way too sweet.  The waitress convinced me to try... and I'm glad I did.  The fruit lightened the flavor and it was just on the edge of dessert.  Yum!

Wishlist/Changes: My friend got Eggs in a nest - which was two pieces of their cheese bread with an egg right in the middle.  The potatoes were a bit bland that morning and the \"cheese\" bread tasted like white bread.  A little disappointing but still tasted good.

Their service is always with a friendly smile... but pretty slow.  When you've been waiting 35 minutes-1 hour and you're one of 4 tables in the joint..... kind of a bummer.  But... the food has always been well worth it and I'll keep coming back.  I even brought a friend from Florida here and she was shocked at how amazing it was.  Thumbs up if you're ready for an adventure to find it and are interested in a fun experience and ambiance."}
{"text":"A typical \"lineup more impressive than the food\" place in Montreal! the food - very average for our neighborhood, the service - hipster & slow. They don't take reservations and they don't tell you this information 'nicely' over the phone. Please try the following within 5min walk if you find the line-ups ridiculous: Arts cafe, Sel Gras (under the radar brunch option on weekend),  Laurence(also a \"food less impressive than the lineup\" spot, but hey, we saw xavier dolan there, so cool enough!)."}
{"text":"So delicious! It was just two of us and we ordered a bunch of food, and each item was a generous portion so we ordered way too much. The bill was very reasonable and we got to pick at a bunch of different items :) will be back next time we visit."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best brunch I've had. The menu was extensive with too many good choices. So hard to pick. I ended up going with the Benny Mac. Which comprises of Mac & cheese fritters instead of the traditional English muffin. Followed by pulled pork(which was melt-in-my-mouth tender) and topped with jalapeño jelly(that was a sweet spicy). Then places were two perfectly poached eggs and the best hollandaise sauce. So delicious. Every bite was a joygasm in my mouth. The drip coffee was perfect. Plus the service was great. Everyone was friendly and prompt. I didn't mind the wait to get inside. Because as soon as I sat down, I was attended too and my meal did not take long to arrive. I would 110% recommend and I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in Montreal. Wow. Perfection."}
{"text":"I loved that place. We had two plates and both were awesome. The chicken waffle and the poutine plate with eggs on top. It was amazing experience with very friendly service."}
{"text":"I was contacted by the management of Fabergé some time ago (apologies for the hold up on the update) to clarify some of the issues my partner and I encountered while visiting.
First of all, no more racist cartoons, yay!
Second, the glasses are not the norm for coffee- something was up that day.
Lastly, the staff was reminded to hold the tude'

I really appreciate the time and attention to detail that went into the staff here considering my review.
Maybe give this place a try? I'm thinking about giving it a second glance."}
{"text":"Before heading back home to Vancouver after our France trip, my travelling partner and I decided to visit friends here in Montreal for the weekend. They told us beforehand that we will be coming here for brunch. I didn't do any research prior and from the name, I sort of assumed it was some sort of Russian tea salon decorated with bejewelled eggs... Boy was I wrong! And in a good way too.

We didn't have to wait long on this sunny but brisk Sunday morning. Going earlier is key. 
Many items on the menu all sounded tempting, but when I see chicken and waffles, I must get it. I just can't help the urge. I don't know why I set myself up for it, because often times I'm let down.  
Well this plate impressed. Four fluffy quarters of waffles and a big piece of chicken to go with each one. Easily shared between two people, it hit the spot. 
My partner also had the same order and we tried pawning off pieces of waffle and chicken to our friends. The pancakes looked tasty, next time I have a chance to come back, I'll have to try them. 
Their different coloured smoothies were delicious, but their mimosas can be too heavy on the juice rather than the sparkling.

Friendly staff, cool decor, this spot was definitely not Russian themed."}
{"text":"There are TWO bottles of water waiting for on the table when you arrive!
They don't have skim milk. Only 1%. 
We brought our baby and they accommodated us with a booth. They have booster seats for older kids. 
The vibe is very cool and hipster. Cozy feel to it. 
The staff is very friendly. 
The food was good. Not a crazy amount of variety but good enough. 
They have sriracha sauce."}
{"text":"This brunch place was well worth the wait. Friendly staff and amazing brunch options would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ultra funky joint that rewards Yelp users! I received a free non-alcoholic beverage ($5 Chai latte) for checking in on my Yelp app.

I was feeling obligated to eat healthy today after my Superbowl binge so I munched down on the Faberge salad which was delicious. The candied nuts on top definitely made it! Would definitely return to explore the breakfast menu more."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffle dish is a must try. Do not order anything else until you've tried this dish. Great service here as well. Price is reasonable."}
