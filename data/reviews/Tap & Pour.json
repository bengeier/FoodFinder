{"text":"Great place, great food! 

Service was fast and  ever was cold. Had the spinach strawberry salad and the wife had the chicken fi gets and fries. Great place to wait in the west jet wing and would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner before our 8pm flight on a Sunday evening.  It took a while for the food to come out (slower than expected, considering it is a airport restaurant), and the food was ok.  I ordered the Cobblestone salad with grilled steak - the steak was nicely cooked and the salad ingredients were fresh, but there was way too much dressing, so it ruined the salad because I couldn't taste anything but the dressing.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken pot pie, and it looked like a small single-serving version of a frozen pie - he said it tasted ok.  Good thing I asked to pay before the end of the meal, because when I realized I couldn't finish my salad before the flight, I requested a take-out box, and it took *forever* to get.  I had to ask three times before I got one, and then she tried to give us the bill again.  Not the most efficient service."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I actually had to walk out. Waited for 20 min at a table, asked for a server twice and still no one came and the place was half empty. Finally got someone and they were out of all the cheaper wine options and offered no discount. I saw the food at the table next to us and the food was sub par for the price. They are the only restaurant in this wing of the airport and clearly do not think the customer matters. My advice - eat somewhere else or bring your own food. Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Airport location. Food was decent. Service was not so decent. No smiles from anyone, total lack of work ethic and slow (except for food delivery)"}
{"text":"i was starving as i was coming home after Christmas vacation. So I was looking for a good food option. I stumbled across this place. I ordered the chicken caesar wrap. I had a bite but it tasted like it was made two days ago. it wasn't good. Very expensive as well as it cost me 14.50 for a medium size wrap. I will avoid this place if i go through pearson again"}
{"text":"We were waiting for a flight and this restaurant is close to our gate so we decided to have a set down lunch.
My wife had a Cesar and enjoyed it, nothing special but she was happy with it.
My Daughter has Poutine , nothing special but again she enjoyed it.
I had fish and it was greasy ah heck.  Also it was previously frozen and for a maritimer like myself ewww"}
{"text":"There really wasn't much in the area to eat, but we wanted something delicious when connecting through Toronto recently. I had a chicken pot pie which was alright and they were out of mashed potatoes so I ended up with fries to go with my peas and gravy and it was pretty good overall -- not quite poutine but not bad either! We were seated immediately when we got to this location, and while service was slow, we had time to linger. I wouldn't say that this restaurant is particularly outstanding or anything but given the few options available in this area and our desire for a good sit down meal, this was an ok option."}
{"text":"A sight for sore eyes!  But a journey to gate B3!

By the time we got to YYZ (Toronto) Terminal 3... on the OTHER side of the blooming terminal too... we knew our connecting flight had been delayed before we'd begun our journey and we needed somewhere to have a beverage and maybe a snack. 

After an odyssey that took us UNDER a runway, along several moving sidewalks, up at least one escalator, I was desperately worried there wouldn't be any kind of food, (let alone gluten free), or beverages at this desolate outpost of the terminal and we'd have to journey the *entire* way back to the main B gates just for a beverage.  The airport website - while truly a lovely creation, did NOT mention anything in the PDFs I downloaded about Termial 3 B gates that weren't ACTUALLY together with the other B gates.

Open the menu, looking for cider, craving cider. There wasn't a single one I could find. OH BUT!! Under Bottled Beer - lo, Angry Orchard Cider!  Oh yes, please. And ICY cold too. 

No mention of Gluten Free on the menu... I was resigned to ordering salad.  Oh now, Amanda our server says, you can have the Gluten Free bun if you like!  VERY tempting, but oh how I longed for a salad, green things hadn't been on the menu at our vacation destination. I passed on the bun, but did add grilled chicken to the simple salad with balsamic vinaigrette on the side.   The chicken had been marinated in something, that I did not see mentioned on the menu - not sure what, and I should have asked. No idea if I could safely eat it. It seems to have herbs, and the chicken was served cold as to not wilt the salad. Warm chicken would have been nice... but it was still delicious.

Dessert? Oh none for the gluten free diner, but... we were too full and I needed a to-go container anyways. My fridge would be empty when I got home, and having a snack for the next day wasn't a bad idea.

Asking about the gluten free buns, Amanda checked with the kitchen and they informed her they serve Rich's glutenfree buns http://richscanada.com/3490/1508/productdetail.html  Not something we have in western Canada, but the ingredients look satisfactory. Watch out the calorie count though - 250 per bun! Gluten free is never a \"diet\" choice!

FYI - they have a shared fryer, sub salad instead if you are sensitive to cross-contamination.

Definitely would be delighted to visit again on my next trip through YYZ, and try something else on the menu. My travelling companion ate every last bit of his burger without much chat - I have to assume it was tasty!"}
{"text":"We had about a 3 hour layover in Toronto Pearson Airport (YYZ) so we made the loooooong journey towards our gate in Terminal 3. Along the way it seemed as we were getting further and further away from any shops or food places so we were very happily surprised to find Tap & Pour very close to our gate.

So after a long flight from Belize to YYZ and a long hoof from our connecting flight to our new gate we decided to grab a big booth and rest our feet and have some food and drinks.  There weren't a lot of options down in Terminal 3 around the B gates but Tap & Pour stood out among the smaller (and few) shops here.

We were surprised to find out it wasn't on Yelp yet. It had been open about a year and a half according to our server. A burger and a beer sounded awesome after a long flight and walk through the airport. The booths are huge and comfortable.  Being late at night the place wasn't very busy so we had to the opportunity to take a whole booth to ourselves and carry-on luggage plus we could take our time.

My partner is celiac so we always hope for a place that can accommodate her food needs. At first we were worried. The menu didn't indicate what items were gluten-free or could be modified. She was about to resign herself to a salad with possibly no dressing or add-ons. We asked our server about options and to her delight we found out they actually have gluten-free buns and bread and can adapt most items. You can read her review for more info on the GF options.

I had Mill Street 100th Meridan Organic Amber Lager (awesome!) and the Smokehouse Burger.  The burger comes with a an Angus patty, swiss cheese, housemade chipotle bbq pulled pork and crispy onions. It is one of the piled high burgers but not overly huge. You can actually eat it without having to deconstruct it to get it in your mouth!  It was pretty good but the bun was a bit dry and fell apart. It was the end of the night so the bun may not have been as fresh as usual. It was a great burger though overall.

Great place for food and drinks in Terminal 3 B!"}
{"text":"Food - Delicious, and it came out fast. Really the places only redeeming factor. 

Service - Absolutely appalling, from the moment we walked in the door. We had to wait to be seated, which is fine, but we watched two girls look at us and then go back to what they were doing before finally someone came to seat us, while doing so she said NOTHING. No \"good morning\", no \"here's your table\", no explanation or comment on the menu. She just threw the menus on our table and walked away. I will give the sever credit, she was fast to take our orders and bring our drinks. However the remainder of our time there all we had to listen to was the four servers complain. Complain about their shifts, complain about the time of day, complain about their coworkers, just non stop. No professionalism whatsoever. Once our initial food and drink was out, our server had no interest in checking in on us, asking how the food was, refilling our drinks, or bringing the bill. They four of them also had no problem standing around socializing/doing nothing when their was people waiting at the door, waiting for their bills, or any other work to be done. 

Food was great but unfortunately the service was horrible enough I will definitely not be back, nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Sarah is Amazing !!  Food is great !!  We shared the omlette.  Plenty for 2 !!
Coffee was good.  Oj was good.  Food came very quick.  Price was good.  Airports can b very pricey.  Located in Terminal 3 , Gate 5"}
{"text":"Pretty good place to stop and eat if you have time. The beer here is nice and cold. Bar tender is vary friendly. I gave this place a 4 star because is took almost an hour to get our food. But the food was well worth it. Maybe because the wait made us so hungry."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this airport restaurant. For the price of the food, you would think service would match. Barely did. Had a 3 hour layover, a  take away wrap was 12.99 which i found steep, so decided to get a spot and watch the game that was playing on their tvs. Some  played sports, other's news. There were booths, seats at the bar, and individual tables along the windows. I waited for 10 min at the front waiting to be seated, and there was more staff than customers. Usually I'd go straight to the bar stool, but I had my luggage and wanted to relax. I asked for a booth but apparently you need to be more than a party of 1? even though the whole restaurant was empty. I was then surprised, that the waitress led me to the very corner of the restaurant away from the tvs after I told her that's what i wanted to do. I asked if I could pick my own seat and she got mad, so placed me beside another guy on a single table with all his luggage. I found my own spot in front of the tv, and she didnt like it. Funny enough must have been her break, but it was confusing...I got another waiter and he was great, pleasant and attentive. However, the first waitress sat beside me but it was like a area of congregation for all staff members. Everyone is entitled to their breaks, however, the waitresses and mangers that were huddled eating poutine and pretzels with their hands were also having to have customers wait at the door to be seated. Weird thing is, they took turns walking around, back and forth from the kitchen, getting their own food then going to serve customers, and then going back to their own food. I took a pic but then i think you can visualize it without me posting. The one guy beside me was trying to get the waiter's attention for water, and the waitress that was sitting down eating food turned around and asked the patron, \"what he wants.\"
It got busy but they were good with seating people away from where they were congregating, maybe that's why I didnt get the best reception when I chose my own front row seat. 
Now should i even get to the foot. The burger, was frozen and thawed, didnt even taste like real meat, and fries were fries. 
I should have just gone next door to Timmies or Subway because then I know what truly paying for. Plus when I did get coffee from Timms they were fast and their attentiveness and friendliness made the layover bearable.
This restaurant should be your last resort, and hopefully they improve to receive more than 2 stars from patrons after me."}
{"text":"Hungry and in Terminal 3 (near gate B5-B1) at YYZ? Given the limited options, you'll likely end up at Tap & Pour if you want something other than snacks. In this fast paced restaurant with people zipping in and out as they shovel down food before a flight, I think T&P do an alright job. They probably deserve a 1/2 star rating: 3.5. 

There are lots of options on the menu for both food and drink. I went for the most paleo looking item: the cobblestone salad. Other than the tomatoes which were obviously out of season and a bit mealy, I really enjoyed the salad. Steak, bacon, egg, avocado, and blue cheese on a bed of lettuce. Well proportioned, solid choice. 

The prices of things are a bit high, which is to be expected. My salad was $20+ but it was quite large and filling."}
