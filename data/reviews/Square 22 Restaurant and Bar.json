{"text":"Absolutely nice restaurant with nice decor excellent services and a very nice menu.  I had the Walleye and my wife had the fish tacos, both were excellent."}
{"text":"Waited a few weeks after opening in hopes some of the kinks would be worked out. Atmosphere and decor are great. Started off at the bar with drinks which were priced average. We were able to get a table in the bar area in a reasonable amount of time. Ordered calamari as an appetizer - the presentation needs improvement. It was plopped on a regular dinner plate with cheese sprinkled on one small section. It tasted very good but expected a better presentation for price.  My husband had the golf shrimp pasta as main course. It was heavy on the butter and some of the seafood was over cooked. I had the pan seared walleye. It was just OK. Tried vanilla custard with sea salt caramel for dessert, and that was very disappointing. They would be better sticking with traditional creme brûlée instead. Overall, found food to be average. In our opinion, at this point, nearby Rosewood and Pomery House offer better food at comparable price."}
{"text":"Excellent first experience last Saturday night.   A very nice casual but classy vibe. Interesting menu with a good selections for every taste. I had the scallops which were very good and my wife had the filet which she raved about. We had a number of appetizers which we split and were all very good, some of which could have been a main course. Our waiter was excellent, attentive but not overbearing. All in all it was an dinning experience that warrants another visit. Our party of six was well satisfied. Not cheap but worth every penny. Looking forward to going back and giving them that fifth star."}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner at Square 22!  Our waitress was outstanding, the ahi tuna poke appetizer was perfect.  For dinner I had the lobster roll which was very good,including the fries, normally I don't eat, but these were to good to leave behind!  My husband had the Great Lakes walleye entree and he thoroughly enjoyed it!  We will definitely comeback to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I have never been treated so poorly as I was last night by ANY restaurant. As you can see clearly on their yelp page they offer take out with no restrictions listed. I also saw that although their bar opens at 4 the restaurant does not open until 5. I got my order together for 4 people which would have totalled approximately  $100, and called at approximately 5:15 PM on Saturday. A person by the name of Dan answered the phone and sounded pleasant, so I explained I was calling to place a take out order. He abruptly stated that I could not place a take out order. Surprised, I'm sure I said something to the effect of \"pardon me, did you say I could not place a take out order\" He immediately sounded agitated that I would dare question him and went on to explain quite rudely that I could place an order but it would be several hours before it could be filled because they have to take care of their inside customers (which I assume mean the ones that are eating on site). I was so shocked that a new business would be even close to this kind of service, that I did retort that I would think a business would care about all of their customers. I explained to Dan at that time that I was placing a take out order because we have a terminally ill person in our family on chemo that cannot go out in public let alone in weather at 8 degrees. He then retorted very nastily something to the effect of \"well how am I supposed to know that, I guess I can make it happen, what are your two orders?\" I was still so taken aback by the entire caustic conversation that he set the tone on that I was literally stunned into silence. I told him the order was actually for 4 at which point he was really irritated. I expressed my dismay at the entire conversation, and he then asked me \"well ma'am have you ever tried to run a restaurant?\". At this point I let him know I would make other arrangements. Ok now a little back story on our situation is that we heard of this restaurant and their excellent food, had a discussion with the above mentioned family member who said they would love to try it. So we spent 2 weeks planning around chemo & holidays of going and being able to do take out based on this restaurants advertising, never imagining that they obviously don't believe in good customer service as apparently they think people only patronize businesses for the quality of food. However, I cannot even speak to that because I was not \"allowed\" to place an order. All I can say is this, either Dan needs to find a new line of work or the restaurant needs to work on Staffing or they need to properly advertise their services. Not only at this point has the restaurant lost this $100 business, but more than that they've lost my respect or any future business or recommendations.  I also feel that customers should NOT have to explain themselves or special circumstances to a business to get fair and equitable service. Just like you Dan, how was I supposed to know you can't handle take out orders when you advertise without the qualifications. Granted I have NOT run a restaurant but I've been in customer service for almost 20 years and NEVER would put the burden of my job on my customers or make them feel as though they bear the responsibility to know the inside and outside of my operations. Shame on you, shame, shame. You have no excuse for the way you behaved. And yes, I will be posting this in every available forum. I was shaking I was so upset because we had spent 2 weeks planning only for me to have to call that family member who we can barely get to eat, who was actually looking forward to Square 22s food, that we had to change plans. I'm just utterly disgusted."}
{"text":"Ordered the scallops which were cooked well but a little salty.  It came with blue crab risotto which was tasty but no evidence of crab anywhere.  Waiter was mediocre and when I asked to substitute broccoli for the asparagus it was served with I was charged for a side dish. The waiter told me that there was asparagus on my plate which there was not. Mediocre is being kind. For the price I would probably go across the street to Pomeroy House."}
{"text":"Food was flavorless, overpriced and very little inspiration. I ordered the Cleveland hot brown. Which was basically a chicken breast, bacon, tomatoes and a cheese sauce. The chicken was overcooked and was unseasoned, the sauce was just cheese with no flavor. My wife ordered the fish taco, since the tortillas were flour (my wife can't have gluten) they offered to put the fish in a lettuce wrap. Which was very nice of them. When they brought it out, it was unseasoned dry fish on lettuce. That is it. Nothing else. I can't recommend this place. The atmosphere was great. But the food was very disappointing"}
{"text":"Good food, and nice environment, but nothing exceptional. Pretty routine menu and mushroom flatbread was a bit too odd for my taste. Burger was great and recommended, waiter was very nice to substitute the bacon for an egg. Possibly will go with some friends again."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch and dinner.   Food and drinks are great, service is exceptional!   My only suggestion would be to use fresh jalepeno in the margarita rather than pickled."}
{"text":"Best salmon I've ever had. Was surprised when I wasn't asked how I wanted it cooked but when it came out I understood why! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great dinner Saturday night.  Got sat for our reservation right on time.  The chicken paprikash  soup was incredible.  Sea bass and filets were very good.  Wine bottle prices very reasonable.  Over very good."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today for the first time and can't wait to go back.  Beautiful décor.  Had the quiche and salad and it was awesome.  Partner had the special smoked salmon wrap and it was wonderful also.  Service excellent. Ambiance relaxing.  TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT!"}
{"text":"Ate here on 5-6-17. Chicken paprikash soup was amazing!  End of story. Brie and enoki mushroom flatbread was by far the worst menu item I've ever had in a restaurant.  Ate half of a piece of the surprisingly small dish. Calamari was drenched in lemon. Cheesesteak lollipops were decent but presentation was unappealing. Staff was nice but our particular server was out of his element.  Overall atmosphere and decor is an upside.  I would take a date here for a drink but would never eat here again....yes, the flatbread was that bad."}
{"text":"The menu was full of opportunities for all types of clientele but failed to live up to the descriptions on the menu. The risotto was an over-cooked mess with little to no lobster to be found. The roast chicken was very moist and full of flavor. Flatbreads were very underwhelming with scarce toppings. Pineapple margarita went over well at our table. Square 22 needs to step up their game in an area where options are plentiful."}
{"text":"Well so much for the birthday dinner...Fail. Started out decent with the drinks and the bar area, but thought it was a little strange that it was not packed on a Friday night. Understand now why.., bland food and under cooked. Didnt think that it was that difficult to cook fish and cook it till it was done. Should have sent the dish back but was to much in a hurry to get out.   Finished with a decent dessert at the end to end the night but thank good that Burger King was down the street.. Great look to the restaurant, seating was a little tight and uncomfortable, staff was decent and strange walk through the kitchen and drink station was a little odd, so much for a decent experience for the wifes birthday. Unfortunately the dishes were bland and just odd pairing of the different food groups. Definitely will not be going back scratch this one off the list..."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends.  Ambiance and decor are great. Service was prompt and efficient.  The food was not memorable in a good way.  Prices are exorbitant for the quantity and quality.  Steak and 2 glasses of wine were $50+, chicken thighs, grits and greens, 1 glass of wine=$31.  Steak WAS good, cooked as desired, but over priced. Friend had the lobster roll .  It was good, filled with  lobster but not THAT much if you compare anything you get up on the east coast.  Burger was good.  Paprikash soup was good.  No options for sides-- entrees were accompanied by a cone of fries.  Greens over salted, grits bland.   For the prices, I expected to be wowed by the flavors.  I wasn't. Would I go back - doubtful."}
{"text":"Scallops were on par.  Delicious!    Customer service was good.   Atmosphere was top notch.   Owner greeted us which was very respectable.   I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I hate to give such a poor review, but our dinner experience here a few weeks ago was rather disappointing.  I so wanted to like this place and our meal...but execution of the dishes missed the mark nearly every time.  My wife, daughter and I sat at a high-top table in the bar area on a recent Saturday night.  the entire restaurant was filled, and buzzing with energy...so cool to see the place jumping like that!  Our served took drink orders and we placed a request for our first two courses.  Unfortunately, the wine brought out to my wife was the wrong one...which was quickly corrected.  We started the meal with the chicken paprikash soup and the Grilled Broccoli Caesar.  The soup was clearly the star of the meal...thick, hearty and full of large chicken chunks and homemade spaetzles on top.  The grilled broccoli Caesar was an unusual dish...the presentation was simply a half-head of broccoli that was overly steamed served with some warm sauce and parmesan shavings to top.  It looked odd, the consistency mushy and the flavor sort of off.  Next, we shared the Rust Belt fries.  I've had other versions of this dish around town...Poutine seems to be \"hot\" right now.  This version was drowning in its brown gravy, which led to many soggy fries at the bottom of the \"pile\" and it was also one of the saltiest dishes I've ever eaten.  We simply could not finish it.  The blackened fish tacos came three to a plate and were reasonably well executed.  The accompanying salsa-style sauce was on the hotter side.  Our last plate of the evening was the Sorrento flatbread.  It was overly greasy/oily (underneath) which you could see as soon as a slice was lifted from the stone surface it was served on.  The flavor combo (which was supposed to have a Mediterranean flare) just did not meld well together and the entire slice lacked any real flavor depth.  For its locale and prices being charged (more in line with those in an urban setting) I had expected much more from our meal, but it just did not measure up.  Maybe the kitchen was overwhelmed that night?  Not sure...but execution is going to need to improve if they expect to stick around in the competitive Strongsville food scene."}
{"text":"Love it here. Scallops and Sea Bass are delicious. It's comfortable, a little pricey, but worth the meal."}
{"text":"We were looking for someplace new to try for our girls night and this new spot was an easy choice as one of us lives in Strongsville. We went on a Wednesday evening and it was packed. We got a high top table in the bar area which was a little bit of a tight squeeze. We had a drinks to start out and they have a wonderful wine selection.  Together we had a variety of appetizers, soups and salads on the table including a mushroom flatbread, House salads, Paprikash soup and crab risotto. The soup was fantastic and the salads pretty tasty. The flatbread was decent but the risotto could have used more flavor and was a little undercooked.  All in all I will be back to try many more of their dining options as well as their new an improved happy hour."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a group here last Friday, and it was even better than my first visit. The food here is great. As a group we tried a few sharables; the Ahi Tuna Poke, Cheesesteak Lollipop and Charred Cauliflower and all were excellent. I was full, but still went ahead with an entree of the Blackened Fish Tacos and a Broccoli Caesar Salad. Wow, that Broccoli salad could be it's own entree and I ate every bite, not because I was hungry, but because it was also excellent. Had to man up to eat the Taco's but it was well worth it. Other items the group ordered included the Cowboy Ribeye, which was huge and the Short Rib which I am told were both very good.  The place had a great crowd. We started and ended with a drink in the bar and the atmosphere is nice, as well as the bartenders. It is an upscale place with a casual feeling. The kind of place where nice jeans and a button down shirt will have you fit right in with the crowd.  Our server, Shane was very good and he was helpful in making recommendations and told us a little about the place as well. We were also introduced to Dan, a managing partner, who made us all feel welcome and also gave us an education on Square 22 and the art work hanging throughout the place.   Strongsville needed a place like this and I am glad to recommend eating here. I will be back, often."}
{"text":"My wife and daughter treated me and some relatives to dine here back in January for my birthday. The reason I am just now commenting about our dining experience is because I just recently downloaded the Yelp app and I see others have experienced some of the negatives we had. First off, after looking at the draught beer selection I decided on a locally brewed porter to complement my meal. After putting in our drink orders our waitress returned to inform me they were out of my selection. After looking again at the drink menu I realized that most of the other draught beers were I.P.A.'s. A more diverse selection with more local ales and lagers should be offered. We ordered the calamari, grilled shrimp and the pig wing as appetizers. The pig wing with the thai chili sauce was outstanding and calamari was very good but the grilled shrimp was nothing special. Our waitress returned and explained the specials  and took our orders. I went with the beef short ribs which were good but pairing them with the garlic and butter spaetzles, which were dry, fell  short. My wife and another member of our party ordered the filet steak special with only asparagus as a side. The filets were very tender, seasoned well and really good but I found out once we got home that my wife paid $58.00  for each \"Special\". I was shocked and disappointed and never imagined they would be so pricey especially since the other meals were somewhat reasonably priced. Our waitress never mentioned the cost while discussing the specials. We were never served any bread and our empty appetizer dishes were left on the table throughout our meal.  Staff was friendly but not very competent. We have not been back since and probably won't in the future."}
{"text":"I love to try new places. The atmosphere, cocktail and hostess experience at Square22 were the best part of the night. The food was sub par for the crazy prices. I ordered a salad and the beets were not fresh - possibly canned. The Chilean sea bass was small and lacked flavor - fishy tasting if anything. Bok choy and mushrooms were soggy. The waitress was nice but never refilled waters.  Definitely not worth the 60 plus dollars for ONE drink, AVERAGE salad and BLAND small dinner."}
{"text":"I had the Cleveland Hot Brown for lunch today. Excellent meal with a great portion size for lunch. Excellent service with a staff that looks engaged and happy to be here. I look forward to my next visit. Great addition to this area!"}
{"text":"Amazing place with a refreshing new look and a great atmosphere to say the least. Very contemporary and a tasteful setting enjoyed visiting this place recently. Wine and food selections were amazing and the service was excellent. Enjoyed every moment out there with family and friends. Julie made sure we were having a great time. Would most definitely come back. Highly recommend this place.  Thx DR MD"}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed my meal. Had the lobster roll and the sirloin entrees. We couldn't have asked for anything more. Staff was great also!!"}
{"text":"We had a salmon salad and a wrap to share. Both were delicious! Our waiter was Clayton, he was super funny and attentive. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We were excited to check out Square 22 and went on early on a weekday evening.  Beer Selection: Nice local microbrews but a bit heavy on the IPAs, only other choices were Stella and Blue Moon that I noticed  Appetizers:  Ping Wing: Recommended by our waiter. Sauce was good but meat was quite dry. Noodles were well cooked but drowning in the sauce.  Paprikash Soup: Best thing we ate. Nice texture, dumpling were good.   Salad: Average, nothing to either way  Entree:  Blackened fish tacos: Terrible. Soggy tortillas. Slaw was bland without acid or bite lacking crunch. The fish was bland devoid of seasoning flavor.   Service: Average to Sub-Par- we mentioned to our waiter that the tacos were not good and he replied with they were his least favorite dish and to put more salsa. Never asked if we would like to speak with manager or if he could get us something different. Otherwise, service was fair."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend wanted to go there because he read bad reviews and wanted to see for himself.  We had a creepy waiter that would stand by the table but would not start a conversation.  I expected \" HI how are you can I take your drink order\" but no I had to say hi and ask if he was there to take our drink order. He was kind but working in the wrong industry ! So we started with calamari.... it was soaked with lemon! I think we both had 2 bites  Then we got the chicken paprikash  soup and tat was amazing!! We then ordered a brie and mushroom Flatbread. The two bites we took made us have the same opinion.  1st it tasted like earth such as eating dirt from the outside.. 2nd my dog wouldn't even eat this. Last week got pork belly lollipops.  Way to rich tadting!! Needless to say we left hungry and have no desire to be back to this \" so cool new  place\" our server did offer us free desert  but we were just so over this hip chic place at this point. Also tables are too close! And later we were there Saturday May 6th and did have reservations.  I would suggest not wasting your money there. Many better options in the city.  I suggest revamping the menu or train your cooks.  Again though the soup is amazing!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times. The drinks and food aren't bad. The service isn't consistently great. Unfortunately, the servers can be handcuffed by slow bartenders. We went here last Saturday night at 8pm. Surprisingly, it wasn't very busy. We had the seasonal strawberry caprese salad and a flatbread last weekend. The salad was primarily strawberries, very light with mozzarella. The balsamic vinaigrette partnered well with the strawberries. The flatbread was ok. It seemed as if it sat under a heat lamp for a while. Our server, Mike, was awesome! He had a great personality and did his best with keeping the flow of the night going at a comfortable pace. Here is where the bartender issue rears its ugly head. There were four of us in the party that night. Each of us ordered 2 drinks throughout the evening. Every time we ordered drinks, we had to wait way too long. There were no other tables in the bar, 2 people at the bar and the rest of the restaurant was pretty light. We couldn't figure out why we had to wait so long each time we ordered something from the bar. Mike apologized each time, but he shouldn't have to. We will definitely be back! I hope we get Mike next time."}
{"text":"Good fresh food and quick friendly service. husband  and I went at the last minute after calling ahead. Would go again. Atmosphere comfortable."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on a week night. I had high-hopes but I was disappointed. The food was overpriced and it was nothing special it reminded me of TGI Fridays  or Applebee's!! I'd say if you wanted to go to a better dining establishment I would go to Pomeroy House or Rosewood Grill instead."}
{"text":"Decent interior but loud with poor acoustics. Appetizers were so-so, drinks were pricey and meals were decent but way overpriced. Staff was young and friendly but inexperienced and inconsistent. Much better choices and better bang for the buck in the immediate area. No reason to recommend or return."}
{"text":"Beautiful décor and nice calming atmosphere. Very good wine list and food. The bartenders are incredible they actually talk to you."}
{"text":"Dan and the entire staff could not have made things easier and more enjoyable!  Our company had a group of 50 people (many from other countries) and they had enough staff to take care of all of us for dinner/apps and drinks. They even were able to create and serve several apps at the very last minute upon request. Food was excellent, service was top notch.  Our company team members had a wonder dining experience and were impressed. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you! Karen"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Could cut my steak with a butter knife!! Our waiter was so great too!! We will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Saturday night. It was \"good.\" I sat at the bar and can say that the service was excellent. The food... Meh.   For an app I ordered the grilled shrimp cocktail. As the name suggests, the shrimp in this shrimp cocktail is grilled, then chilled, and then served with the usual horseradish cocktail sauce. I didn't care for it, nor did my girlfriend. It's just weird. Probably a never again for me.   For an entree I ordered the Blackened Fish Tacos with a side order of the Blue Crab Risotto. The tacos were pretty good, and the portion size was more than I expected. The risotto was \"OK\" but a bit undercooked and lacking flavor. I actually took some home with me and it was much better the second time around.   For me, this is a \"stop in for happy hour and have a drink\" kind of place. I really can not say enough about the service; superb. The menu for me, however, is a bit of a reach (like so many of the new places) and the food just doesn't command the prices."}
{"text":"I've been excited to try out Square 22 since it opened. I'm very happy to see that Strongsville is getting more unique non-chain restaurants. We went on a Thursday night for my Dad's birthday. We made a reservation, but could've walked in without one. We sat in a room that the doors open to be a patio. Unfortunately it wasn't a nice night or that would've been perfect. I'm a huge fan of patios in the summer and love finding restaurants that have them. They also have a really nice bar!! The bar was packed so I will have to go back for a happy hour and sit at it.   Service- I didn't think the service was anything spectacular. It seemed like our waiter was paying more attention to some other tables, but it wasn't terrible either.   Food- They have a large variety of options. I was torn between a lot of items, but ended up getting the house salad (champagne vinaigrette dressing was AMAZING)  and filet, which came with roasted potatoes and asparagus. My meal was very good, but seemed like your typical nice restaurant steak. My mom ordered the same meal I got and my dad got the short rib which looked amazing!!   It is a little pricier here, but it's worth the higher price. I really hope this place does well and I can't wait to come back and enjoy the patio and try their happy hour."}
{"text":"My daughter, husband and I had dinner here last night. First of all I love the ambiance. It's cool and cozy all at the same time. I loved our booth overlooking pearl road. It's was pretty watching the snow come down. Later I realized there was a fireplace and wished we were seated near there because It was a bit chilly near the window. I had the bourbon braised short ribs. Don't think I've had better anywhere. My husband had the walleye which was so fresh and delicious. My daughter had the scallops which were perfectly cooked. The waitress was awesome. I can't wait for summer to sit on their patio and enjoy a drink. A much needed addition to the area."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends tonight and loved it! Great atmosphere and excellent food. It is a little pricey but we were all really impressed with our meals. For appetizers we had the cauliflower and stuffed Hungarian peppers. Both were good but the peppers were outstanding. I had the filet mignon special and it was cooked perfectly and tasted excellent. The mashed potatoes it came with were delicious as well. Service was great! All around an awesome experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Looking for another upscale place to put in the rotation, heard about Square 22 so off we went. Really cool place, build out was hip and trendy, bar offered plenty of cocktails and ole stand bys.  Started with Calamari and Ahi tuna apps which were very good. Entrees included scallops and blackened fish tacos. Nice portion sizes and awesome flavors.  Looking forward to another visit. Madison took very good care of us. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is nice - the decor is current. The wine list by the glass is ok. I asked for a bolder style red and a $13 glass of Cabernet was recommended, which was not as bold as I expected it to be. The burger is very good - we asked for medium and it was perfectly cooked. The problem we encountered was with the scallops. They were immensely gritty! I mean, my teeth hurt. I mentioned it to the waiter and was given a free dessert for saying something but I really should have sent them back - especially a $34 plate! I ended up taking half home to try later and I ended up throwing them out. If you order the scallops, emphasis rinsing them well! Other than the scallop issue, I would have rated higher. I think most people could find something they like on this menu."}
{"text":"Such a great dinner! This is an upscale yet cozy restaurant new to Strongsville. I came here  on a weeknight with my family to celebrate my sisters birthday, and we were promptly seated.   The food was absolutely amazing- We started off with the cauliflower appetizer, which was so unique. It had a lemony taste, but was savory at the same time. We couldn't stop eating it! I had the garden party flat bread as my entree, which was way better than I expected. It was ricotta cheese on a flatbread, with a pretty good assortment of veggies on top. Loved it. The menu is available online, and from what I understand they are still tweaking it a bit. My sister got a lobster roll which she said was great, my dad got a pork chop which he loved, and my mom got a steak which was also good. We needed a few to go boxes.   The service was phenomenal. Our servers name was Shane (request him when you go!) and he made our dinner even better. He was extremely attentive, answered all of our questions (we had a lot since this is a new place), and made great recommendations. He told us about a caramel dessert, creme brûlée I believe, which ended up being like a flan-- and it was to die for. We almost ordered a second one to take home and eat!   I took away a star because I expected there to be more vegetarian and vegan friendly options here. That would have been nice. Shane told us that there are many gluten free options, which might be exciting to some people.   Overall, great food, outstanding service, would definitely recommend. Also, they have a full bar which looked like it had plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This place has the right idea, and lord knows Strongsville can use more non-chain foodie spots.They have a decent wine list, and the menu options are interesting, and generally well executed. I've been here a couple times, and will be back again. I hope they do well and more places like this pop up so people in the suburbs don't have the schlep out to Tremont or Lakewood any time they want something decent."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding.  This place sets the bar.  The food is world class and the atmosphere is incredible.  Great job to the team here.  Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!! The food was exceptional for the price. Great atmosphere and crowd as well"}
{"text":"Really disappointed! I was so excited to have a trendy restaurant open in Strongsville in a sea of restaurant chains. The menu lacks variety and the decor is sports bar meets fine dining; totally contradictory. My husband ordered the lobster roll, which was dried pieces of lobster on a hot dog bun next to a side of unremarkable coleslaw. I had the scallops which were cooked perfectly but way over seasoned. For the price (most meals were more than Pomeroys), definitely not worth it. Our service was great and when the server noticed my husband did not eat his meal it was taken off of our bill. Square 22, as a Strongsville resident, I really want you to succeed! I hope you take this as constructive criticism, with a few small adjustments I think you could be just what Strongsville needs."}
{"text":"They were incredible. The customer service was terrific. We had a minor issue with a meal and they not only took it off their bill but they gave us another one to take home because they really wanted us to have an experience that was unforgettable. They also gave my wife a glass of wine on the house. We will be back for sure. That is the best customer service experience we have ever had anywhere. Thank you."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday dinner and it was amazing!  We sat at the bar and had a drink and enjoyed the cool atmosphere.   I had scallops and my boyfriend ordered the pork chop..... both were absolutely phenomenal!Chrissy the bartender was adorable and sweet as can be!  We will definitely be coming back to Square 22"}
{"text":"It's a nice cozy place with relaxing atmosphere, but the food is just ok. Shrimp cocktail which is $15 (full price, and $5 happy hour price) has 5 shrimps on the plate which are grilled & chilled and tasteless!!! Irish Coffee cocktail is really watery. For entries we got half chicken and strip steak, they were pretty good, meat was juicy and tender. And our server was a nice person, as well. It's not a bad place to go, but will we be back? No!"}
{"text":"Got bread after 25 minutes and had to ask for it.  Had to ask for a drink menu.  They forgot my salad.  I had to ask for another drink.  Lastly, they brought me a dessert for my birthday, cool, but they charged me for it.  I was not seeking free cake.  If you are going to charge me for a dessert, let me order from the menu.  Good was decent but over priced.  Don's across the street has just as good food in the downstairs pub across the street.  Food was OK but not superb.  It might be 5 stars for Strongsville. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Wow. Best flatbread pizza I've ever had. The one with artichokes and feta. And that was my husband's meal! I had the roasted Brussels sprouts and parsnips. Just appetizers this time around but we will certainly be back! Friendly, attentive waiter, warm atmos"}
{"text":"Drinks were great, food was absolutely delicious! I had the filet and it may have been the most tender filet I've ever had. If it was socially acceptable I probably would've licked my plate clean. Service was very good too. Would have been 5 stars but the women's bathroom was quite dirty--I actually walked into a stall and walked right out and waited for one that was already occupied because the seat had something gross-looking on it.   Also, seems like too nice of a place to have TVs in the dining area--the bar I can understand but having them in the main dining areas make it feel less \"fine dining\"."}
{"text":"I was in Strongsville on business and needed a nice place to have a meeting with my business partner (aka wife) for dinner so we thought we would check out this newly open restaurant we saw being built over the summer.  Square 22 ended up being a home run.  It has a great atmosphere for both a casual or chic dining experience that reminds me of a place I regular in Manhattan on business.  We shared the calamari app, blacked fish tacos, and the 22 burger (gruyere and bacon) which were all fantastic at a great price. I will give extra kudos for the fish portion and freshness... sometimes the fish restaurants use for tacos are \"just good enough\" and try to mask it with filler but the at square 22 the blacked pacific whitefish was money... well done!  The menu is diverse depending on your budget, wine selection had great value, and they had a great beer list with local brews for the out of town guest (nice porters).  We will definitely be back on our next business trip to try the sea bass and 20 oz ribeye. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed with our lunches at Square 22. I had a \"Farm Beet\" salad with grilled chicken added. The salad portion was, in my opinion, extremely small for a $7.00 luncheon salad. The chicken was ample and very good tasting.  My wife had the quiche which came with a small (very) salad. We both felt the quiche was tasteless.  We shared a carrot cheesecake and felt it was very good. Our friends ordered two different sandwiches (burger & French dip) and seemed very satisfied with both the serving size and taste.  Very nice decor, decent service but a little pricey. It is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the place pours really good drinks, nice appetizers, but the entree quality didn't match the price. I had the short ribs and they needed to braise them longer.  They were kind of tough when this entree should be fork tender. Wife had the lobster roll which was good.  For appetizers and drinks....4 stars  Atmosphere....4 stars Full dinner service....3 stars"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and great service from Courtney. Red snapper with pumpkin bisque was very flavorful and light. The lamb T-bone was perfectly cooked and moist. Spaetzle had a little too much garlic for our liking, though a great portion size. Chocolate factory cake was very light.  Romantic atmosphere. Plaque in building states business casual. Expect people to dress up. Some people were dressed in shorts. I felt over dressed."}
{"text":"Our family members attended this restaurant last night to celebrate several birthdays.  Haven't concluded yet the next morning what was worst, the food or the service.  Evening started out with an approximate wait of 30 minutes to receive my ordered cocktail.  Also of note, out of several of the featured on tap draft beers.  Waitress seemed to not have a clue.  Several times, some in our party came close to getting up to talk with a manager.  Entrees finally arrived with a mixed bag of results.  Walleye was noted as being very good while the Faroe Island Salmon entree was bland and tasteless.  Don't they have spices in the kitchen?  Granted this is a newer restaurant but it has been open now for almost 3 months.  Bottom line, save your self some $$$ and frustration and have dinner elsewhere until this place gets their collective act together and determines if they want to be a place for the bar crowd or a fine dining establishment.  Right now they succeed at neither.  UPDATE:  One of the owners of Square 22 reached out to me after becoming aware our experience at his restaurant.  He apologized for the bad experience and offered to have us return so that they would have an opportunity to make it up.  The fact that he cared enough to make the effort means a lot, and more than anything gives me reason to give Square 22 another shot.  I'm sure the management team has reviewed what happen that night and has taken corrective measures to improve.  Kudos to management."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my wife and another couple.  They all wanted to go since it opened, hearing all the  hype about Strongsville's newest fancy restaurant.  The place was bustling with lots of customers, eager to visit the new eatery.  I was disappointed on many levels.  First, our table offered us a beautiful view of the back parking lot - not much they could do with this, I suppose.  Second, I ordered a side dish that the waitress told me she sent back because it didn't look good-I did get it after my meal was finished(not good to have a side after eating). I was not charged for this item, but how hard is it to get a side dish right.  Lastly, I let myself be talked into the filet-a mistake I have only made once before-I never get steak anywhere but two steakhouses, one in MEDINA and one in Akron-they specialize in steak and they always get it perfect.  Not only was this filet just average, but I choked on the price-$60.00!!  I recently bought four Black Angus filets(10oz. Each) at Market District for $47.00!! I advise you not to get the $60.00 filet-the hype about this place just did not produce the promised results!  I will stay with the great place across the street."}
{"text":"Three stars for ambiance. I will excuse the food due to the recent opening. A pappardelle aglia olio That could be lifted in a clump from the plate, a chop that lacked the browning and seasoning shown in photos. I want this place to succeed but they are not ready if my first visit is typical."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place. They're always busy. Staff is extremely nice and helpful. I just wish they had more vegetarian options (:"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. Granted we did try it when it was newly opened but there was nothing impressive at that time to encourage me to try again. The space, I will say is big, open and beautiful, and a decent patio. The menu was not that impressive. Being that there are only a few small plates then right into the over priced dinners, so it wouldn't be a lunch spot. The food was basic and reminded me more of a commercial spot, while the space had a lot of potential to be more. I ordered a basil salad and it tasted as if the salad had been sitting for days absorbing the flavors of whatever else it was around."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! Read quite a few reviews and wasn't sure what we were going to run into, pretty much everything negative that was written we did not experience.  I was concerned about: Value, flavor, service but we didn't have any issues with that at all.  Value: we had beef ribs, filet, some type of vodka drink, glass of wine and a slice of cheesecake and our bill came to $111 - I thought that was pretty reasonable for what we were having.  Flavor: in all fairness, we were drinking Jaeger across the street before we got there, so my taste buds were a little burned out. The seasoning on the steak was bold enough to cut through my Jaeger-burn, the cabernet drizzle on the mashed potato was not strong enough for me to taste (although my wife said she could taste it and it was a subtle flavor). The steak was out of this world, I asked our server to let the chef know I would eat whatever he chose.  Service: our service was fantastic, it was 8:30 at night, so it wasn't like it was rush hour, we never needed for water refills or a check-in.  Overall great experience, we will definitely go there again, next time I am looking forward to trying a seafood dish."}
{"text":"Facility was stunning, waiter was friendly, and food was great! Steaks were cooked to specification and Vegan Burger was good! Definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I love the way the place is decorated but I'm not in love with the food.  Very over-priced in my opinion and you can find much better quality food across the street at Don't Pomeroy House in both their formal dining area and the pub downstairs.  I will say that the staff is very friendly and very attentive.  They are very good at what they do.  But the food just isn't worth what they are charging.  I think it was $15 for a burger and it wasn't anything that great. Certainly not a $15 burger.  $29 for the fillet mignon and I've definitely had better.  The food wasn't horrible, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't that great.  Next time, I will go to Don's across the street."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and had a great experience. The blackened fish tacos were full of flavor and prepared to perfection. The menu has a wide variety of items to choose from. Very fast and friendly service and I think this new spot will do quite well. Can't wait to return soon for dinner!"}
{"text":"I've dined here quite a bit and never had a bad meal.  Their fish selections are always good, including the Lobster Roll.  I tried the chicken drum appetizer tonight and it was excellent.  Service is usually very good and the drink selections do not disappoint."}
{"text":"Square 22 is a different kind of place for Strongsville, who has long been plagued with only chain restaurants to choose from. It was  a crowded Monday evening, but the 4 of us were seated pretty quickly.   Our server, Carter, was very nice and personable. He made small talk and joked with us.  I would guess that he was probably given too many tables because he wasn't as attentive as a server should be and I could tell that he was, in fact, a very good server.   The menu at Square 22 is a little trendy for me. When will this cauliflower craze be over???  I chose the blackened fish tacos, Mom got a filet and the others got the Great Lakes Walleye. The drinks were priced about $7.00 each and everyone was very happy with the bloody mary or margarita. We did not get a basket of bread, as promised. That was a little disappointing because I was hungry!  Our food came and I could tell the guys were not impressed with the portion size of the walleye dinner. Dad said he could have eaten 5 of these dinners. But that tells us the food was good! I snuck a little bit and really enjoyed the prosciutto paired with the fish. I also loved my fish tacos. Nice crunch on the slaw, the fish was cooked well. Mom enjoyed her filet with mashed potatoes too.  Overall, our bill was $132 for 4 entrees and 3 cocktails. I thought the prices rivaled Don's Pomeroy House across the street... and for that price I think I would rather go to Don's. The portions are larger and I think it's just a higher quality restaurant. I think I would go back to Square 22 if their prices were a little better. The menu and prices made it feel like it was a special occasion kind of place, but I wasn't as impressed as I had hoped."}
{"text":"Food was great. Drinks were very tasty. Dessert was fantastic. Service was perfect - our waitress wasn't at our table too much or not enough. The atmosphere is great and the whole dining experience was awesome. Went on a Saturday night and sat ourselves at a table by the bar. It was busy which was expected. It was a very cool and modern restaurant. It was a little pricey but the food was stellar."}
{"text":"The braised short rib was up to expectations, spaetzles and gravy very tasty.  Also props for the paprikash soup and flatbread pizza.  Wish they hadn't run out of Citramax."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this restaurant for quite a while and just got the chance to stop in.   The menu looked amazing.... but sometimes how things sound aren't how they come out.  The cocktails were amazing, which I would hope they would be... at $20 for 2 drinks.. they lived up to their potential.  The pork belly was similar to a piece of rubber.  The flavor was there.. but they definitely don't know how to cook it correctly.  Every place we've been, it melts in your mouth.. not so much.  The Philly steak lollipops (or whatever the correct name was) was just gross.. for my husband not to eat something, that is a big deal.. they were dripping grease and just not so great.  The rest of our food was just okay.  Service was just so so, I can't make a ton of complaints but there aren't many compliments either.  When our food came out I was ready for another drink, no one asked if I needed anything.... so I never ended up with another.. which I guess it ended up saving me $10."}
{"text":"First time I have had dinner here that wasn't bad, just not glowing.   I had their bloody mary...best I have ever had in a restaurant. Husband had a good cab. Salad was very good. I ordered the blackened fish tacos. Tepid on arrival, and really the fish and the \"slaw\" that came with it was pretty tasteless. Had fries with that, and as usual, they were outstanding. Husband had the pork tenderloin special. He said it was \"good\". Not great. But very tender. Coffee, and l creme caramel for dessert, wonderful.  Won't hesitate to go back, but never again those fish tacos."}
{"text":"Hostess and waitress were really nice but food was not good. We order the clams and asked to have them taken off our bill because we couldn't chew them. I ordered the lamb medium rare and it was charred. My husbands steak wasn't good either."}
{"text":"I can only speak to the lunch here, but will be going back for dinner soon.   I love a good lunch place where on a sunny day there's a patio and also an open wall leading out to the patio. My husband and I stopped in for a quick lunch here and this place had both. It was a beautiful summer day and the openness of the restaurant was a great afternoon mini date. That's the main reason for the 4 stars and why we will be back.   For lunch we tried the hot brown, the chicken paprikash soup, and tuna croissant. The soup was my favorite as it had a great flavor of not too much sour cream or butter, but definitely some spices. The bread for the tuna salad and hot brown definitely came from a store rather than in house. Personally I've had better from a hot brown and tuna croissant, but I've definitely had worse so the food, in my opinion, was alright. To be fair, we didn't venture into more of the menu because of time and we picked some safer options.   For the ambiance though and to try the rest of the menu, I will definitely be back. I would suggest anyone looking for a restaurant in Strongsville that has great seating for summer to absolutely give this place a try. It's a big enough menu you can find something or even grab a drink, well worth the trip. Also if you're into chicken paprikash soup that has a better bite than cream, this is a great stop."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. It's great to find a gem, where the prices are truly worth what you're getting! You have great gourmet meals at just a decent price tag in the 20s. I have had the Paprikash soup, which is rich, creamy and delicious. I have had both the beef short rib dish and the seafood pasta, both are items I can't steer away from when I go there.  I was a huge fan of the bone marrow appetizer special, but this is not for weak and weary. If you are not a fan of meat fat texture, this is not for you. Otherwise, for those who don't squirm at mushy, greasy deliciousness, GET IT. Your taste buds will thank you, while your arteries rebel.  Service has been very good the few times we have gone, with the wait staff being extremely knowledgeable of the menu and friendly.  I have seen their Monday/early bird prix fixe menu (3 courses for $22!), which is next on my list to try!"}
{"text":"I am 100% confused as to why this restaurant doesn't have a 5 star rating? I've been three times now and each time the food, drinks, and service have been stellar. On my visits so far, I've had the chicken paprikash soup, house salad, Rust Belt Fries, Great Lakes Walleye, and the Bourbon Braised Short Ribs. I was impressed each time. Every dish wash packed full of flavor and I really enjoyed them. Typically I find one dish at a restaurant that's always my go-to, but here I try something different each time because EVERYTHING on the menu sounds delicious! The Great Lakes Walleye is the best fish entree I've ever had. Square 22 is the perfect addition to Strongsville, and I hope to keep coming here for years. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Had our Valentine's Day dinner here the night before Valentine's Day because of our crazy schedule.  I have gone back and forth on giving this 5 stars versus 4 stars.  It was very close.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly at a table along the outside wall of the restaurant looking at Pearl Rd.  The decor of the restaurant is what I would call upscale casual.  The pace of the service was perfect.  We were given a wine and beer list.  They scored huge with me having a beer list.  I usually have to drink ice water in nicer places.  Here I ordered a Columbus Brewing Thunderlips on tap.  That was awesome!  A delicious hoppy pale ale.  After ordering drinks I started my meal with the Wedge Salad.  It had ranch dressing with blue cheese crumbles on top and bacon.  I enjoyed the wedge.  It was very good as well as the bacon.  Creamy, tangy, smoky.  Just delicious.  For my main course I ordered the 14 oz. Strip Steak cooked medium and it came with a Cauliflower-Asiago bread pudding.  And housemade worcestershire.  My steak was cooked a perfect medium.  Outside of the steak had a perfect crust with a very tender and juicy interior.  This is one of the best steaks I've had in a while.  I really enjoyed dunking each tender bite into the housemade worcestershire sauce.  It was not as salty or bitter as the bottled kind in the grocery store.  This was flavorful and delicious.    The Cauliflower-Asiago bread pudding was dry and pungent.  It was as if this was cooked the day before and left out to sit in a warmer before it was put on my plate.  Very disappointing.    My wife ordered a filet and ordered her steak with mashed potatoes. She raved about her steak.  And complained she didn't like the mashed potatoes.  I tried the mashed potatoes and they were bone dry.  Everything here needed to be beyond perfection to get a 5 star rating and their side dishes lost it for me.  We shared the french toast and vanilla bean ice cream dessert with bourbon sauce.  I had a coffee.  The toast was the same bread we had with our dinner service turned into french toast for the dessert.  It worked.  It was crispy, flavorful full of cinnamon and spice.  The ice cream reminded me of the kind I make at home on an ice cream machine.  Bourbon sauce was good.  I just wanted more of it.  It was put on with a plastic bottle with tip most likely.  And there wasn't enough of it.  We had a great dinner here.  I'd easily go back.  I just hope the side dishes get as much attention that our other dishes had moving forward."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! What a great addition to the city of Strongsville. The decor is trendy, yet very welcoming. Lighting/ambiance is perfect. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. My party ordered the following menu items: fried calamari, short ribs, special filet mignon, standard menu filet mignon, chicken schnitzel, chocolate mousse cake, french toast n ice cream, 2 mixed drinks, 1 mocktail and a glass of red. Not a morsel or drop was left. Absolutely delicious! Cannot wait to dine here again!"}
