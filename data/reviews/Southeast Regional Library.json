{"text":"I love this library so much. They have a great layout, a perfect location and friendly staff. Their website is extremely helpful. You can search for your books online, request a hold then pick them up in the reserved section under your name.   I liked the library so much, I begun volunteering a couple weeks ago. The staff is so nice to the volunteers. I feel very welcome here."}
{"text":"Very clean, and quiet place to study!!!  Only complaint - kids getting loud at times...parents should teach them  -- why they came to the library in the first place!   Parents eventually end up going to their doctors, my kids won't study or concentrate at the library... Of course Doctors prescribes them ADHD meds) -- this is the cause/effect of the epidemic.  Just tell your kids to behave period. Sorry to go off topic but it's overwhelming annoying at times.   Library is awesome with the little rug-rats!"}
{"text":"I love this library! From the blu rays to the DVD's their selection is fantastic. They have seems to have some amazingly new movies which I'm always impressed with. There are also some great CD's to choose from.  Another this I really enjoy is the architecture. From the front the building it looks pleasant enough, but the interior seems so welcoming and relaxing for some reason. Add that to the fact that when you look out the windows at the back makes you forget where you are - like you should be duck hunting or something - and what started as a run to grab a couple books and a movie turns into a leisurely day with out a care in the world.  Except you forgot about those overdue charges... whoops!"}
{"text":"I love the library! The location is great for me and the kids. In ten years I've never had an issue with the staff. There is a good selection of books, DVDs, and magazines. Anything I can't find on site I can usually locate within the system and place a request."}
{"text":"Super lovely library! The building has a beautiful design inside, with cathedral ceilings throughout and while at the study desks spread throughout, you sit next to these floor to ceiling windows that overlook a lake. Simply gorgeous setup. You can see people walking on the trails outside as well as fishing and occasionally, you can catch a glimpse of a flock of birds flying in formation. The only downside to all this is that I noticed feathers stuck to some of the windows with imprints (meaning, because of the clear windows, the birds sometimes do not see the windows and fly right into them. Wish there was a way to alert the birds of the windows so they don't injure themselves)."}
{"text":"Love this Library and the park is fantastic!  The building is wonderfully designed with expansive view of lake.  Inviting seating, I could easily be here all day.  The park is wonderful for picnics and walking.  Bird and people watching galore.  Kodak moments abound."}
{"text":"Love this library. Have been visiting this branch for more than seven years. Everyone in the library is very helpful and go out of their way to help. Even though I read most of my books from Digital library, I still love to go to the library and get books from there."}
{"text":"This library is always great! It has so much space and so many areas to do homework or any paperwork. You can do some light reading or go crazy with studying. Either way I like to read books and love big spaces! I always have a great time here and appreciate their hours (open till 9)."}
{"text":"I like to think of myself as a library connoisseur because, well, I like libraries and I've been to a fair number of them.  This library is awesome. It's clean, well maintained, and has lots and lots of computers.  There are sections for DVDs, blue-ray, series on DVDs, and of course, books.  But I'm going to let you in on a secret: you can go online and put anything you want on reserve for yourself (assuming you have a library card), and they will email you when your item is ready to pick up. And it's free!  The staff has always been great. We love this library. I wish more of our tax payer money would go to fund services like these!"}
{"text":"I've been using this library for a few years now and have always enjoyed it.  Friendly staff when I've had questions, really nice selection of material.  I've even gone here a couple times on my work from home days because the environment helps me focus."}
{"text":"I really like my library. It is spacious and cool and organized and has lovely views of the bird sanctuary. Seems like the shelves are rather barren lately. Is it all going the way of e-books?  I love libraries in general. This one is modern but lacks the excitement of the downtown Phoenix library or the amazing Seattle library; thus the 4 star review.  It never ceases to surprise me that 4 out of 5 times I go, it is closed. Go figure...."}
{"text":"If ONE MORE KID cries I'm going to literally have a mental breakdown. It's like a day care in here. Anytime you come. Seriously. If you want to hear screaming and crying all day, come here. Ugh. You would think the parents would take their kids outside when they are yelling!"}
{"text":"I came to this library because I recently moved back to the city and it is close to where I'm living - it also looks beautiful on the outside. I was really excited to visit but upon my arrival and walking toward the building, I got bombarded by at least three different adult solicitors (something about angels and other religious things...) I smiled and said \"no thank you\" politely however they kept trying to grab my attention as I walked inside the building - not the greatest impression but I was still open minded.  As the other reviews state, this place is LOUD. I mean, constant children screaming and yelling. It is VERY hard to ignore. I also found it very difficult to navigate the shelves and there weren't very many people there to help me out - I had to leave after 15 minutes because the noise and confusion was just too much. Maybe it is better when school is in session? I'm not entirely sure.. bummer."}
{"text":"I love this library. The Liberians are always friendly and very helpful. I just wish they had more holiday books for the kids. I had to reserve a lot of Halloween and Thanksgiving books for my niece because there was none on the shelves which is not the library's fault. The trial they have behind the library are breathtaking and very well kept. I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"They have a really fun story time for kids and lots of programs for all ages. This library is also on the Riparian Reserve and has tons of walking trails and animals to see. The lake has turtles and its home to a big variety of birds."}
{"text":"They have a great child section & also very friendly and helpful staff. Location is convenient and they also have great classes for kids & adults!"}
{"text":"Our family uses the library multiple times a week. We \"rent\" our movies here, attend events, and of course check out too many books. My 10 year old and 1 year old both love coming here.  It's always clean, quiet, and has the nicest staff ever!  We usually make a trip of it and take a stroll through the Riparian Preserve as well."}
{"text":"When we first moved to the area we found this was a great place to spend some time exploring the facility and what it had to offer. The personnel are very helpful and the library has a lot to offer, but what I love most is that it's technology is updated and easy to use whether you are using the computers for research or to check out items.  Also a great place if you need to print something."}
{"text":"Wow, it's like a playground in here with kids screaming, yelling, and running around. Parents make no effort to control them. No wonder the enclosed study rooms are always booked. What had happened to libraries being a QUIET place for reading and studying? Had to pack up and leave after 30 minutes because of the noise."}
{"text":"This was where I spent every weekend this semester to study.  I love this library, the view from the large windows is better than the view from my other favorite library, Burton Barr.  Nice large tables, plenty of outlets to keep electronics charged, clean bathrooms.  My only complaint is that they don't do a very good job of monitoring the noise level in the library area.  I understand that some people out there don't have a clue about what's going on around them and allow their kids to play hide and seek and throw temper tantrums outside of the children's section but the librarians need to regulate.   I still have to give it 5 stars though because it's so tranquil to me... when the screaming kids are gone."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite libraries.  They designed it with a large open high ceiling and large widows for lots of light.  This library seems to always have a good selection of books and movies and the staff is always very nice.  Their childrens' area is just off to the left when you walk in so kids have their own place to read and play.  If your there to study or get work done there are lots of quite undisturbed areas.  This library has lots of programs they offer from movie nights to book clubs and kids activities.  I haven't attended any of those yet so I can't review that aspect but the events always look fun.  Adjacent to the library is a nice pod and a park, its great to stretch your legs and take a stroll.  You might even see people fishing."}
{"text":"This library has great services, plenty of books and resources, and many study tables and rooms. I really enjoy studying here because it is nice and quite. The view to Riparian Preserve is beautiful and helps me relax too.   Librarians here have been really helpful when I had questions. I also like the variety of programs for children and adults here. The only thing that could make this library better is if it had some more books. I have had a few occurrences when the resources I needed were out stocked for a long time. Otherwise, I love coming to this library."}
{"text":"Too loud! People come here and use the Library as an indoor playground. I see kids running, yelling and playing video games(mine craft) in the children's section. It's impossible to have your child sit and read in this environment."}
{"text":"Great great library here in Gilbert. Pretty big selection of books. parking are is very large so finding a parking spot is pretty easy. There is also a nice drop off area up front. One of the better ones here in Gilbert for sure."}
{"text":"Love this library! They are organized and the layout is awesome. Teens and kids have their own areas to lounge. There are plenty of computers too."}
{"text":"Came in to use the computer and was able to get on right away. It's a nice and clean library with a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"I really like the children's center here they have many books and a wide collection of children's movies . The story telling room is very cool !"}
{"text":"I love the views of the riparian preserve located behind the library. It has some great trails, wildlife, and scenery. There's a gorgeous view of the pond and makes studying and reading really relaxing. The library is pretty clean and quiet."}
{"text":"Found my new favorite place to study!!! Overall, the library is very large and seems like it contains a decent amount of books to check out. There are many many computers out for guests to sign up and use for free. The youth section is HUGE. I think this library is very kids friendly (which can get pretty loud sometimes, so minus half star)  Parking: plentiful!  Atmosphere: modern, clean, and the view is awesome! Tables are large and there are plenty of seats. Wifi works great! They're also pretty lax about food and beverages which is a big plus because I can't study without my snacks hahaha. My friend and I love to sit in the back of the library and stare out at the ponds and people walking by. The scenery is just so calming and serene, really helps lower my stress level (I'm in med school, so anything to remotely reduce stress is gold).  I also like to zone out and imagine that I'm outside soaking in the beautiful weather instead of sitting on my behind for hours studying.   Hahaha jk, because of the library proximity to the reservation. You can easily take a walk around the ponds of the reservation as a study break. Definitely will be coming back frequently to study!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst library I've ever been to. We came in around 4 or 5 on a weekday afternoon and we immediately noticed there was no seating. We had to wait for someone to leave just so we could sit down and do some work. The second thing we noticed was the sound. There were literally kids screaming and running around. I will bet that ANY Mcdonalds play place is quieter than here. The architecture of the building makes things echo so when people were conversing it sounded like the inside of a middle school cafeteria. It was impossible to focus and we ended up driving 10 minutes away to the Mesa red mountain library. My other complaint is that they do not offer guest passes on their computers but that wasn't a huge deal. I only gave it two stars because it is pretty big so I'm guessing they have a good assortment of books, and the lake front view was nice ( too bad there were no seats next to it). So if you only need to grab a book and leave this library will suit you. I am never coming back here and would highly not recommend this library for someone to do work at. You're way better off working at a Starbucks or even a Mcdonalds play pen."}
{"text":"I love this library! Awesome selection of reading material, audiobooks, and movies. You can reserve a study room for free and the Wi-Fi is reliable. I regularly select my items online, put them on hold, and pick them up at the library. Make sure to pick up your requests on time though, or you will get charged a $2 re-shelving fee."}
{"text":"After many, many failed attempts to come to the library and get a library card, mostly due to my poor planning, we finally made it! I was pretty spoiled when it comes to libraries because of the Frisco, TX library which was amazing, and I am happy to report, just in case you were loosing sleep over it, that this library comes pretty close.  The library is good in size, clean and well organized. Employees are courteous and friendly. There is a separate section that has the children's and teenage area. They have a good amount of computer stations and plenty of tables plus private rooms.  Definitely a good place to come with your children or even by yourself to spend a nice afternoon."}
{"text":"Nice library with TONS of computers, private study rooms, community meeting areas, and right on the Riparian Preserve and Lake. Beautiful area!"}
{"text":"Loudest library I have ever been to. They can come to you when your phone accidentally goes off and you don't hear it (which is fine), but they can't tell parents to control their children or for people to stop sitting at tables to talk. At least 2 or 3 of the study rooms have the most uncomfortable chairs ever. I'm only giving 2 stars because I'm fine when I'm in a study room where I can block out the annoying kids screaming. A library isn't a daycare. Wish they'd actually enforce the rule most libraries do aka BE QUIET. Wouldn't recommend this library, it's just the closest one to me so I try to deal."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have been to this library and BOTH times my daughter has tried to get the required Book for School & they are \"out of stock\". When going to the computer to look up the book details-Given these options: It list \"other\" location(s) that have it, the \"on holds\" (wait list) for this particular location & offers another option for YOU to reserve it. We had requested this prior and were never contacted? Today, when we were in we dealt with the same issues- put this book on hold & are hoping to receive an email letting us know when the book will be in. This place always seems to be busy, maybe that's WHY they never have enough volume available. Supply & Demand: with ALL the schools here in Gilbert this place needs more to offer students within the district!"}
{"text":"I come here to study all the time! Apart from it being a little too crowded and the tables are all taken its a good place to study, there's also a lot of cool blue ray movies to rent, and the view on the lake when studying is breath taking!"}
{"text":"I love this library. I go there twice a week, and always have a good experience. The fact that there are unruly parents and their children is not the fault of the library staff. You can imagine the uproar, if they tried to get these people to behave. I don't use the computers, since I have one at home, but I can see how important it is for those who don't. If it was in their budget, I'm sure they would expand their computer department. We are fortunate to have this facility in Gilbert."}
{"text":"If you study well with screaming children, this is the place for you! Constant. Children. Constant. Screaming. There are study rooms available, but you have to reserve them weeks in advance."}
{"text":"C rehearses right down the street so when I drop him off I occasionally come here to get some work done. There are plenty of tables & chairs and outlets to plug in the laptop. The men's bathroom has been clean each time. For a smaller community library, this place is great. I have been here a few times and have not had any issues.  Clean, Nice little Library. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"One of the cleanest libraries in the East Valley!  Staff is very helpful, even if you have to wait in a line.   Many options available for patrons. Nice little book store in front to purchase books. Bathrooms are clean and well maintained.   We love coming to this library!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this library.  Beautiful facility: clean, well-lit, and organized.  Easy to find what you need, website is easy to navigate (and simple to request items to place on hold), staff is very friendly and helpful.  Went to our first toddler story time today and it was great!  It kept my six-month-old baby engaged the whole time with songs, stories, puppets, etc.  We love visiting this library on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"It's close to me, and it's beautiful right on the Riparian Preserve. Huge windows in the back so you can get a comfy seat and have a great view of the lake. Since you can request all your things online through the county website, getting what you're looking for is a breeze. They also have great reading programs for children, at least I think so. Who knows if they've been cut by now. Good place to escape the heat of summer."}
