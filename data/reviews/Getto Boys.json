{"text":"My husband and I stopped in midweek for lunch and are so happy we did. It's such a treat to find tasty food with gluten-free options for those of us who need them. I love the atmosphere:  laid back, comfortable, sports but not too loud at all. The staff was friendly and prompt and the prices are reasonable. I think we've just found our weekly meet-up spot."}
{"text":"Really like their gluten free menu. The fish and chips are amazing. Bright and clean eating area and friendly staff."}
{"text":"A nice find on the Trans Canada ( 16 Ave) Calgary.  I have made a couple of tricks in already Great food outstanding Service and Child friendly.  Their specialty burger made of a pork and beef mix is wonderful and filling.  The Buffalo burger was very lean and delicious.  New decor with a game room ( cards, chess etc) for a group or club.  Lots of tv screens up to enjoy sports.  I recommend"}
{"text":"Our experience at Getto Boys was positive. We had a very nice beet, goat cheese salad (starter size) as an appetizer. It was fresh and delicious.  It was surprisingly large for a starter size. We each had a Getto burger. It was a very healthy portion (translation-BIG!). The burger was comparable to other restaurants such as Earl's or Moxies. The day we went it was on special for ten bucks. A good price, considering those other places are selling burgers for about 15 a pop. The service was pleasant, quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money on the ribs. I thought I would try this place. Walked in  and sat down at the bar side and ordered the ribs, Both the baby ribs and beef ribs. Lack of sauce, pork ribs were small  and dry, the beef ribs, hardly any meat on them  lack of sauce. Aftertaste lingers for awhile. Won't be back, Montanas ribs beats this place all to hell. Went down to Peters Drive in for a burger and shake after spending $30."}
{"text":"Had the house burger with beef/pork ground together. Great combo. Modern funky interior, many GF items and two veggie burger choices. A new find."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed on my first visit. Service was slow, and apparently the kitchen was understaffed.... On their 'all you can eat' ribs night. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Voodoo Lounge was my jam back in the day because they had the most extensive and inclusive gluten- and dairy-free menu I've found. Getto Boys has such an airy atmosphere in comparison to Voodoo. The menu is still amazing, but there doesn't seem to be any substitutions for those who need dairy-free options. It says on the front of their menu that their deep fryers are dedicated gluten free so there's no fear of cross contamination. The waitress said that they make their honey garlic sauce in-house, so it's GF too.  The chicken fingers and fries are to die for. Moreso the chicken fingers, but oh my goodness. I cannot recommend the food enough, especially for those who want/need GF options.   Great service, great atmosphere, reasonable prices. And kid friendly!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, large tables for our group get together in the basement, great drink specials and I really enjoyed the gluten free deep fried pickles, nachos, calamari, chicken wings and potato skins. Fun place for a gluten free gathering!"}
{"text":"I like that this place has a pub/bar feel to it. I can bring my daughter here for the pub fare experience. They have a kids menu, isn't overly loud, and the staff and food is great and reasonably priced. I am sad I live farther away than I'd like, as I'd come here more often."}
{"text":"Place was newly renovated from previous (Voodoo Lounge ) we were given menus, they took our drink order served our drinks and informed us the kitchen was closed. I would not have ordered a drink had I known this. Will not be visiting again. It says restaraunt but if you do not serve food...how can this be?"}
{"text":"I went here last night for a Paint Nite, with a few friends First the good. The waitress was TOTALLY into me! No thats a lie, but I like to feel pretty. I did enjoy her though, very friendly and even though busy she kept a good eye on us. Second the fries and the poutine where ON POINT! The burger was good, not the best I ever had, but worth the money. I had 3 different drinks and was pleased with all 3, had a pretty good selection of beers as well. What cost them the last star was first their deep fried pickles. I love deep fried pickles, we ordered a plate and by far and away it was the worst deep fried pickles I have ever had. Im sorry, not the the worst I have ever had, but just...The Worst. Notice the capital letters, indicating its a noun, like some sort of boss in a video game. I was just really let down by them and it soured my regular sunny disposition. Also I got SUPER pumped for a Spiced rum in Vanilla Coke (try it, just trust me) and they where out of Vanilla Coke. Im not going to hate the forever for it...but they saw my tears! Worth checking out if you like doing things while you drink, the music downstairs was fun to after we where done painting"}
{"text":"New weekend brunch is fantastic.  Incredible service and the place is Iooking good.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not the nicest place but the Signature Burger is phenomenal. It was made with pork and beef and a secret spice mix served on a flavourful foccacia bun with lettuce tomato and pickle. It was cooked perfectly,  juicy, and had a wonderful herb taste to it from the bun. The fries were mediocre. If you don't care too much about the ambiance or service and just want to eat a REALLY tasty burger this is your place."}
{"text":"My friend was dying to try this place. so it was a good day for beer sunshine and burgers and that's what happened.  I was thoroughly impressed with the selection of burgers that they had on their menu, a duck burger! Interesting but I didn't think it was my cup of tea. Our meal nonetheless was exactly what you expect from a burger pub. And they had a real french fry not anything frozen .   I must say the place looks way nicer inside from what it used to be and the staff were nice even the bar manager came and checked in on us. He personally invited us back to come try brunch the following Sunday I said just started that program.    I might actually have to come back and try brunch or the pizza."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a good review. As a friend of a celiac, we really wanted to enjoy our meal. Unfortunately, the service was so appallingly slow and forgetful that one of our party almost missed her flight. The ribs were overcooked, it's almost like everything was going sideways. The service was the final killer for us. In an almost empty Sunday restaurant, there was no excuse. The main highlight was the brand new server in her first hour - at least she was aware that the situation was bad. Don't think I'll be coming back.  Edit: Another member of our party who has been there multiple times mentioned that the service and food was subpar, and was told to fuck off. This is absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Awful experience here, the food took an extremely long time to come to the table. The service was few and far between, and the meals were incomplete. This restaurant had very few people and our meal took an hour.   The ribs were dry and the sauce was barely there.  Upon payment the severs were incredibly rude and snappy.  Poor quality of food, poor service, will not eat here again. Disappointed as we had heard great things."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever met a more ignorant \"manager\". Sadly the food was bland, poorly cooked, and the service was atrocious. If I walk in to a restaurant with 2 tables taken... I don't expect to have an extended wait. We had someone who had to catch a plane with us. The food, after being, told there was only one guy in the kitchen (a lie actually), was not delivered when we were promised. After going to the bathroom I returned to the table to find that the bill is sitting there with no reflection of the issues they are having, and having been accused of skipping out on the bill. When I went to the server telling her I didn't appreciate the accusation, her denying it and the the \"manager\" then telling me the food was delivered in a timely manner, and the food was fine. I essentially had to argue with him that I wanted one of the meals taken off. Apparently they feel I was a crappy customer, rather than a guy just looking to have a decent meal. And the problem was not something they needed to deal with... You guys may want to consider changing managers. I won't be back... And if you're wondering if you should go, don't."}
{"text":"An excellent venue for bands in the basement. A good flow of people...space for rhe band on stage and the sound was relatively good for a concrete space.   Unfortunately the service was awful. We sat at a table and my boyfriend and I were completely ignored by two waitresses. Which was frustrating as we both wanted to order food. So we moved to the bar which historically is the spot for better service and again we were ignored for a while. So 10 minutes to get a beer.  Still no waitress to order food though so I went upstairs to the bar and ordered food from a lovely woman upstairs.  Unfortunately the Saturday special of the 995 steak sandwich was cold steak for the both of us. But the fries weren't overcooked. The gravy was the warmest thing so I poured it over the food. Oh right when the food came the server forgot cutlery so I had to walk over to the server station and grab 2 sets but 1 set only had a knife.   The bartender noticed how unhappy we were with the food and compensated us...which was very nice. It just seems like the staff are disorganized...so drink and eat before you come here...but the bands are worth it."}
{"text":"We had hot teriyaki wings and the BBQ chicken pizza both were decent food.They both tasted like bbq ribs. Service was slow and infrequent. We are likely to return again. Apparently they had a paint night event going on in the basement which prevented us from exiting through the back where I had originally entered.   $40 for the double order of wings, pizza, one pop and one Caesar."}
