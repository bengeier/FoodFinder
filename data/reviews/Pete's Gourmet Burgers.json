{"text":"This is my first time ever reviewing. Today was my second time here. Ever since I visited the first time I have thought about this place. All I have to say is that their mushroom burger is to die for. So juicy and flavourful. Portion size is spot on price is good and the owners are so friendly. Do yourself a favour and experience a burger like no other."}
{"text":"You can tell when you enter it is a popular hang out spot for the locals.   The staff is friendly and there is always a daily special.  If you are searching for some good old fashion burgers and poutine I recommend you go."}
{"text":"I went there on a Wednesday for lunch at around 12.30 and I was surprised that I was the only person there. The homemade Burger that I ordered isn't great but isn't bad either. The only time I might go back is for the lunch special which is $7 for a combo. Otherwise I would rather go to McDonald's that's across the street"}
{"text":"Between working late and a trip to the dentist i was getting hungry around 7:00pm.  I spotted this place and decided to pop in and give it a try.  Its a small place, with a few tables and some bar stools up at the window.  Anyhow, I'm always willing to give the little guy a try over the big chains.  For such a small place they seem to have a fair sized menu.  I eventually settled on the souvlaki on a bun.  So i ordered, then pulled up a seat at the window and read the paper and they called me when it was ready.  My first impression was it smelled good, but i was very hungry by this time so anything probably smelled good to me.  My first bite is where it came together, you could taste the char on the meat and the crispness of the toasted bun.  Now we are getting somewhere.  The Tatziki sauce was mild but thats ok, it does not overpower the barbecue flavor.  So it was good, but i think it would have been better if they gave it a shot of the oil and lemon once they took it off the grill.  So my experience overall was good.  The food was decent, the price was right, everything was fresh and the people were friendly.  If i am in the neighborhood again I suppose i would stop in again and see what else they have to offer"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start.  This restaurant was recommended to me for their burgers. It's a very small place with limited seating and although my first impression was that it was dirty, it's not... it's just really rundown.  They not only have burgers and hot dogs but also an entire Greek AND Italian menu which, I thought was a little strange considering the owners are Asian.  Anyway, we ordered a Home Burger combo and a Gyros on a Pita (with a drink) which came to $15.49 after tax.  The burger was just okay, nothing spectacular. Apparently the 'Home Burger' is made from scratch and the regular burgers are frozen. I have to say, I've purchased frozen burgers from my local grocery store that have tasted better than this, \"made from scratch\" Home Burger.  The Gyros was prepackaged processed meat and so overcooked it was almost rendered inedible. There's not really much else to say about this place. Definitely not worth the money and it was no surprise that we were the only people there.  Interesting side note: The classic horror movie 'Christine' was playing on the television while we were there. Now this is absolutely one of my favourite horror flicks but our food was given to us right at the point in the movie when Arnie and his girlfriend are at the drive-in.  He steps out of the car to fix the windshield wiper blade... his girlfriend takes a bite of her burger... and Christine tries to choke the life out of her.  Huh."}
{"text":"I was surprised when I walked in. Greek food done by Asians. No matter. It doesn't matter who makes it as long as the food taste good. I believe its run by a husband and wife team and I have to say they did a pretty good job replicating Greek food. Its like a knock-off Louis Vuitton bag.   Ordered a large chicken slouvaki dinner for just under $12. Comes with flatbread, salad, rice and the chicken itself. Everything tasted great and its comparable to Jimmy the Greek. Good portion of chicken meat. The meat itself was tender and juicy. I thought the rice portion was a bit small. Usually for Asian take-out I'm use to the container being filled to the very top. So I figure if Asians are running this place then I would get similar portions. But just by lifting the take-out bag I could feel how light it was :(  Service was great"}
{"text":"A nice mom and pop shop in Pickering. They advertise gourmet burgers and we decided to get the mushroom burger with fries and a drink. The fries were well done but it gave it a very nice crunch. By the end of the box of fries you can feel like you ate a lot of grease which was unfortunate. The burger itself was also a little bit well done and on my boyfriends burger you can taste a little bit of the char which was a unpleasant. On the mushroom burger he allowed us to put on whatever toppings we wanted but recommended mayonnaise tomatoes and onions. His suggestions were good and it didn't feel like it was too much. We have had these burgers before but decided to write a review this time around, overall the burgers are relatively good but sometimes it could be a hit or miss. The owners of the place are very pleasant and welcoming and i don't hesitate to come back. It is one of those places where you should give it more than one chance."}
