{"text":"Stopped by here yesterday on a whim just because I vaguely remembered hearing about it somewhere. I was in the area looking for a place \"near the funeral home with that makes tasty chickpea snacks\" (according to my sister). I didn't find them unfortunately.

Was kind of hungry so I went in to be greeted very kindly by the two women behind the counter. There was a customer already leaving who was chatting with one of them at the front counter. The woman behind the counter seemed intent on serving me to the point where she broke off the conversation early (that was a nice touch). 

I ordered the corned beef sandwich. Was offered the choice of rye or kaiser bread and 3 types of mustard (honey, dijon, regular). The meat was heated in the microwave and then topped onto the bread. Paid, left, hopped onto the streetcar home, and dug into it during the ride. 

It was a nice and moist sandwich. But seeing as it tasted like something I could have done at home, it's definitely losing points there. To be fair though, I didn't really know what to order. Maybe I should gone for something more interesting like a schnitzel sandwich or something. 

They had a lot of imported german foodstuffs and candies (is there really enough of a market for German cough drops in Toronto?). And their baked goods selection looked (and smelled!) delicious. I saw a pretty looking apple strudel that had started out rather large that was practically gone. 

So overall, if I was ever in the neighbourhood again, I would try another sandwich from it. I would definitely pick up some pastries. And the two women were very friendly and approachable (never a bad thing).

They do have a small amount of seating within it and during the summer they apparently break out outdoor seating. So there could be a nice experience to be had there..."}
{"text":"Having reinvented itself from the olden days as Griffiths (on Queen-the place with all the butter tarts in the window), it's still like stepping into weirdville, but well worth it.  Everything there is delicious and they are so nice and attentive.  I love their schnitzels and sandwiches and sometime fantasize about going there for a nice evening dinner.  Cozy reclaimed church wood decor.  Very old European and ornate.  Boy can they cook!"}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of luxury European baked treats.  A favourite is the 5 year aged cheddar, crumbly, zesty and 'farm' style cheese.  I have never found it's equal even though regularly shop at St. Lawrence market and Kensington for cheese.

Mother and daughter staff are friendly and feel like family after you've been going for a while.  Charming old world as well as the chance to order your own pipe band for events

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It looks small but open up in the back. Lots of eye candy knick knack decorations. It's clean and a nice place to sit. This place used to be called Griffiths and was on Queen Street East. A beaches tradition. Hope you like German food."}
{"text":"One of Toronto's cutest, best kept secrets. The most amazing cookie I've ever had. The owners are your super nice grandparents from back home; the inside has a consistent Wes Anderson vibe. Please do check this place out"}
{"text":"The Gem just off the Danforth on Main!
This place has all the best Austrian, Dutch and British goodies that you could ever want.  
Even better it is a true family deli/restaurant run by a mother and her daughter.  They are fantastic and truly put their love into all that they do.  They remember each client and actually talk to them!
I've been stopping by a couple of times a month for the last year. It just gets better and better each time.
Today I had a sandwich to go and a Rittersport Chocolate Bar.  The sandwich was a kaiser with honey mustard, thinly sliced freshly cooked rare roast beef piled high with my choice of Emmentaler cheese.  It was delicious, really the best sandwich in the city.
I also have a soft spot for their schnitzel.  Superb 

Update March 29/2018:  I was walking pass the deli tonight and I noticed a large poster in the window announcing that they will be closing up permanently at the end of May 2018 after 21 years in business.
I am very sad at this."}
{"text":"This place is indeed a hidden gem. The little back room is like the cosiest little euro-tea room imaginable."}
{"text":"The sweetest little hidden cafe. The display in the windows are so tempting with so many yummy baked goods to choose from. Inside there is a deli counter and a shop filled with an assortment of German food products. In the back of the shop there is a sit down cafe also. But it is hard to figure out what is on the menu for the day before deciding to sit down or have take away."}
