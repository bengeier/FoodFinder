{"text":"What you get when you don't change for 30 years. That is the vibe of this place. High prices for average food, based on two people having a sandwich and a soda for lunch. $20 per person? Not good value.

The Reuben was moist, but pretty chewy. Pasta in the Chicken Orzo soup was pasty, kind of like if had been sitting on the stove for a long time. 

The aging booths are also fairly uncomfortable, with a back tilt worthy of a La Z Boy recliner."}
{"text":"A mom and pop restaurant that offers a variety of food options, including a assortment of Greek dishes. Located within a small shopping center adjacent to the Holiday Inn Express, I was impressed with my selections. I opted for the Greek Salad and a cup of Chicken Orzo soup. The soup was very flavorful with a rich broth and chocked full of Chicken. The Greek Salad was truly a delight with an abundance of fresh vegetables. The dressing was creamy and delicious. I believe the feta was heaven-made. I liked this place and I'll be back when I'm next in Newmarket."}
{"text":"Like this place has dinner twice in the past month the staff are very helpful and the soup and s always homemade. The salads and steaks are awesome and the Greek food is so tasty. The only complaint I have is they close at 8 pm on a Friday and I work late so I need to rush to get in a great meal. If you stay at the holiday inn it's a fall out the door great place for dinner and breakfast."}
{"text":"Good food for a diner, servers were friendly, no complaints. Was leery of some of the negative reviews but I tried anyway as I was staying at holiday inn on business trip within walking distance. Dinner was good, chicken souvlaki, so I went back later for breakfast. Eggs Benedict was on-par with what I expect from a Benedict! LOL...Canadian bacon is just ham (I am American). I would go back next time I am here."}
{"text":"I always order their Greek salad. Love the dressing it comes with! My only complaint would be prices are a little too high."}
