{"text":"Let me ask you a question. How do you feel When someone steals your wallet from your back pocket when you are on vacation? Angry? Frustrated? Violated? Taken advantage of?  Well that's how I felt after my friend who were decently hungry and I ordered the two person \"nachos\" plate. The waitor showed up with a plate that literally had 5 round nachos on it with tomatoes, onions, guacamole, and cheese.  That's right. 5 nachos. The waitor said \" I usually cut it down the middle\".... Im thinking, I usually just eat it whole. I could have ran across the street to the gas station and got a full BAG of nachos an dip that would have tasted muuchhh better for $5!!  This is where the violated feeling comes in. These 5 nachos for 2 cost $18!!!  That's insanity. The reason it's insane is that it wasn't even good!! Or a large plate of nachos with the works like you get at every other bar!!! And the fact that it specified \"for two\" blows my mind!  Next time I want to feel violated, taken advantage of and humiated I will surely come back to myplace."}
{"text":"We stopped in a week or two after My Place opened and then just about a week ago.  The first time we went for food, the second time we went for music.   When we went for food, the waiter totally messed up my boyfriend's order and then sort of laughed it off saying \"yeah I didn't tell the kitchen no avocado, that's my bad\", but didn't offer to fix it or take it back.  Luckily I like avocado and was able to help my boyfriend out.  He helped me with my poutine. Unfortunately we both ended up with stomach aches.  I've got a cast-iron stomach, so when I ended up with a stomach ache from my beloved poutine I realized that something just wasn't right.   The second time we went to go see a band.  It felt like we were in someone's basement and not in a homey way.  The bartender made eye contact with no less than two people in our party who were at the bar, but didn't take our drinks order.  We ended up just leaving. I hope that things have improved or that we just had the misfortune of going on some off days.  I really want to like here as it's in my neighbourhood."}
{"text":"They're done!  It's closed, and you killed it.  Yeah, you reading this.  Why didn't you go?  \"My house is too far\".  At least you have a house, unlike the building's former staff.  I'm only assuming.  This joint was great but ultimately few people ate there, and among those few could have been you.  I had a great time myself.  Why didn't you say you were coming?  Oh that's right: you weren't.  And you didn't.  And now they're gone, and all we've got is Queen's Pasta again.  Apparently it's Earth next?  Whatever.  Earth isn't My Place.    Cold, thankless world."}
{"text":"We went to My Place last night, and it was a really great experience.  The bartender/server on the main floor was very friendly, honest (telling my wife that one of the beers was at the bottom of a keg and to order something else) and attentive.  The Seafood Chowder was excellent last night, and the \"small\" appetizer sized portion was huge and quite reasonably prized.  I have had somewhat mixed experiences here in the past, but the last two times I have sat in this same bartender/server's section and he has made sure that our experience was good."}
{"text":"Umm, thus place has been closed for about six years? Pretty sure it is still closed? Yelp, why are you listing closed places..."}
{"text":"There was an earlier conversation reel about trends and fads happening in the T.O. foodie scene and I've realized that the advent of the \"gastropub\" is one of those terminologies that probably can fit in to that conversation reel. With the growing popularity of spots like HOP & the Q&B, the gastropub continues to emerge as part of the dining scene and the latest entry to this, My Place, actually quite surprised me.   Located over by Jane & Bloor, My Place (a former sports bar) puts their focus on \"Canadiana\" dining, driven by the culinary guidance of Chef Brad Long. Chef Long (Veritas) might be recognizable as one of those chef dudes on the Restaurant Makeover show. I was a bit leery at first but I gotta say, I was won over by this spot and I'm definitely making this one of go to places when I'm looking to kick back. They've got a decent beer selection, wines are not grossly overpriced and they shake a decent cocktail to boot.   There still is a bit of a sports bar feel to this place but it's not in your face. MP offers up nights of live music and even an open mic session a couple times a month. But the real surprise for me was how good the food was. Chef Long has a love affair with the whole local/organic scene and it shows in the menu. This place offers a wide range of food from bar foods to rack of lamb with pricing all over the place.   We had just stopped in for some cocktails and began ordering up the bits and bites to tie us over while we were tippling. Gotta say those french fries I refer to as golden spud nuts are freakin delish. My fav food though was the Maple Red Necks which are chicken drumsticks that have been marinated and then cooked in some sort of sticky maple syprup/bbq sauce. I love food that makes me lick my fingers and then have me asking for a dozen extra napkins because my face looks like a Picasso painting.   My friend ordered a half pound burger with double smoked bacon and aged cheddar sided with a big huge pile of those tasty little fat french fries and a lip smacking sassy coleslaw. This was a steep burger priced at $18.00 but I'd take this burger over a W Burger (in the same price range by the time you add on the sides/toppings) any day of the week.   My Place ain't cheap for gastropub but what I've learned over these past couple of years, when it comes to food, you get what you pay for. Meat, cheese and other major food products on the MP menu are basically Ontario based. I'm committed to supporting this type of menu and price tag. There is even a section on the menu devoted to Vegetarians.   The service was friendly and on top of things. Our waitress saw how quickly I was motoring through the napkins wiping off the maple syrup sauce slathering on my mug. The menu has some interesting slants on it, offering up some family dining suggestions (dinners for four), sharing platters for people watching hockey games, things like this.   I really think MP has slipped in under the foodie radar. I expect it'll develop a very good neighbourhood clientele (it's an upscale area of T.O. between High Park and the cusp of Old Mill). My next trip will be for a dinner outing as a menu that boasts Pickerel and Rack of Lamb is my kind of gobbling spot."}
{"text":"Brad Long got it all wrong...  I'm a curious person, I like to try new things... I like to move it/move it, but that's all elementary. I decided to give My Place a chance after recommendations from the Food Network and an 'old friend.'  I'm a fairly patriotic person, but sometimes I cringe when I see that Canadian flag used for evil. You know - Roots Canada, Molson products, bicep tattoos and My Places' concept for a logo. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for eliminating the white-trash and 'gitter-done' atmosphere of Bloor West Village (My Place used to be called Billy Bob's dontcha know), but by taking that concept and glazing it with a fresh pseudo posh decor and so-called Canadian food stapes, and making the customer pay exhorbitant fees for it, is unacceptable.  Half a point for having Guinness on tap. Minus 2 points for only having 'Canadian' beer on tap - I get it, it's Canadiana, but if you're gonna spend hundreds of thousands on rennovations, at least put some risky drinks on tap - Stiegel? Boddington's? Smithwick's?  OK drinks really aren't an issue here, I just want to complain about everything if I can, like waiting a few minutes to be seated until the bartender finally showed up to say, \"I don't know what I'm doing\" and scanned the reservation list, meanwhile there are like 2 tables occupied and dozens empty.  Then we have the actual menu which reads like a dumbed-down version of Uncle McGovern's grocery list. Food is categorized just like caveman would do - \"Pig\" \"Beef\" \"Chicken\".   Unfortunately anything listed under those headings come with a price -- Shepherd's Pie for instance (my g-friend ordered it) was $19 and it's price-point stems on the fact it comes with Lamb - gourmet, yay. However, it's portion size and look is very McCains-esque and it's blandless has some familiar quality to it, oh yeah, the 'Equality' brand! I knew it tasted familiar... those college TV-dinners sure saved my life (at .99 cents a pop, not $19).  I chose the \"famous\" Tillson Burger @ $14. I failed to read the 5-wrap tortilia part and was shocked when this bulbous piece of bread, shaped like a UFO showed up on my plate. \"How the eff am I supposed to eat this?\" I said. Knife and fork it shall be. Fortunately the meat/beef tasted all right, but the lettuce and whatnot it was dressed with was tasteless just like the unmelted cheese-curds on our $9 poutine.  The bill came to nearly $80 and basically what we consumed were: 2 pints, a burger, poutine, shepherd's pie and 4 timbits that were supposed to be some fancy esquisite donut thingy. Essentially this could all be purchased from the CNE food court for a measley $25.  But that's exactly where Mr. Long succeeds... he brings the carnival-like quality of a fairground with a vintage appeal of a 1983 Leaf game basterdized by a Trump-type mogul's vision of a city far greater than Toronto, and a country much less embarassing than Canada.  My final point of advice: if  you plan on using the washroom, do not make eye-contact with any of the patrons in the basement bar enjoying their Labbat Blues and 50s. There's something shady going on down there, and I don't intend to find out what. I do, however, intend never to go there again... well, maybe for the $10 hotdog. I acquired gut-rot when it was called Billy Bob's, and I got it again with this new get-up.   Not even my humour could save this unsavory date folks... when my girlfriend asked, \"would you like to go back to 'my place' after this?\"... my response of: \"Um... we're like already here\" was met with some laughs, but the kind of laughter you receive from a perverted, widdowed grandfather who is just too cute to ignore."}
{"text":"I decided to go to My Place one Friday night despite the bad reviews here and I was pleasantly surprised.  The rooftop patio has a nice casual and comfortable atmosphere, service was great, staff were extremely friendly and the food surpassed all expectations. Undoubtedly, this is one of the nicer and more affordable restaurants in Bloor West Village. Everything is made in-house and the committment to local produce and sustainable fish is commendable.   The menu is interesting with lots of options, even for vegetarians. The Portobello burger and berkshire pork melt were outstanding (bread is baked in-house and the pork was melt-in-your mouth good). I was impressed with the dessert selection and eager to try something but the meal was extremely filling and I couldn't give in to temptation.   This is worth trying. I suggest you ignore the other reviews and give \"My Place\" a shot!"}
{"text":"I have been to My Place at least a dozen times since it opened. Some experiences are fantastic, other experiences leave me wondering if I have even visited the same restaurant. The menu is different for a pub, where an item may seem like normal pub-fare, it is usually interpreted or made fancier by the use of local ingredients or techniques. This is a great concept, when it works. It does not always work at My Place. Some items seems to be a colossal failure. The nachos are just awful, as other reviewers have mentioned. The burger wrapped in a tortilla is a great, if not surprising solution to a regular messy, dripping, over-topped burger. The fries are fantastic with their house-made aioli. Brunch is expensive and not very good. A good tip is to ask what the butchers stack sandwich is, it changes daily and is often interesting and delicious.   My rule with My Place is to avoid ordering anything that sounds too experimental, if you stick with the burgers, fish and chips and fries, you will have a higher probability of happiness."}
{"text":"I came here to watch the Giants-Phillies game, NLDS Game 4.  Awesome.  So awesome.  What a cool little pub.  There were even actual baseball fans here, just chillin' secretly.  They have their own beer on tap, which was pretty damn good considering the price.  Next time I'm in TDot...coming back."}
