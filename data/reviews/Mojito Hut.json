{"text":"Such a fun place to stop by while walking on the strip! Best drinks by far! Strawberry Mint is my new fave drink in Vegas! And Mike is an awesome bartender! Makes bomb drinks! Drinks are refreshing and definitely worth the walk over to ceasars palace. Stop by if you are visiting Vegas for a fun time!"}
{"text":"Mike is a gracious host and generous bartender.  Black Dragon mojito is tops.  Don't be fooled into getting a drink at Spanish Steps next door.  This is the real gem."}
{"text":"Best mojitos in Vegas, if your visiting its a must! Worth every penny... And Vincent is the best bar tender always sweet. Been coming to this spot for over 6years.."}
{"text":"Mike is awesome and the drinks are amazing too! My friends and I have been here a total of 3 times this weekend. The drinks are strong (but taste amazing) and so refreshing. It's crazy you even get a buzz because these drinks are that good! Mike is awesome and fun to chat with, if you are here and want a great drink check this place out, you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"I am a mojito addict! Everywhere I go I like to try them to find the best one. And The mojito hut in Vegas is by far a mojito to die for!!!!! The original is always great. But the other flavors are so incredible it's nice to mix it up! And let's not forget, the shots per drink are very very friendly servings. About 10 shots per drink. Non stop pouring!!!!! No measurements here. Worth every penny in Vegas. This is where you will get the most for you money!!!!!! I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in front of caesars palace a def must go. The best mojitos I have ever tried. When I come to Vegas this is my first stop!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best mojito you will ever have!  Never miss a trip to this place every time I'm in Vegas.  I'm a cheapskate but this is my vice EVERY single trip, multiple times. Worth the price, great bartenders.  Makes the losses at the casino bearable for sure - they'll do the trick and are so good you forget you're drinking.  Used to always order the original mojito until I discovered the blackberry mojito with Malibu.  . This place is actually part of the reason I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best Mojitos ever!!! And Vinnie is super friendly! Right outside Caesars palace."}
