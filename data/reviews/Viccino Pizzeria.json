{"text":"Great place if you are looking  for good food (they serve authentic Italian pizza made in a real italian oven) after a day on the beach. Prices are reasonable and the food is DELICIOUS. The service is very friendly as well. Great find!"}
{"text":"We had take-out and liked it very much. Timing was right on the nose no waiting although it was quiet. The whole wheat crust was nice and crispy, tasty and held ingredients well. Toppings, although not thickly applied, were plentiful enough. Take home and crack open your own wine. Tasty!"}
{"text":"Just the thought of my last visit on Saturday night with my gf makes my mouth water. Great food, great company and affordable. I don't crave pizza often, but visiting Vincinos reminds why I should!! I think I may order some take out this eve."}
{"text":"Yum. Just what I want in a wood-oven pizza - thin crust, crispy but also slightly chewy and a range of topping offerings from your simple margherita to a deliciously salty version of pissaladiere (onions, olives, garlic and anchovies). 

They do have a liquor license now, and the wine selection is pretty decent.

The rest of the menu (other than pizza) might be a bit hit and miss as it seemed more like something one would find at a chain family resto, but don't let that put you off. If in doubt stick to the pizza, it's worth it!

Friendly staff and cosy decor, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic wood oven pizza. They're still just starting out, but it's by far one of the best pizzas I've had in Toronto. Nice enough atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. Give them a try, I'd hate to see a great new restaurant go under.

I should add that this is hardly a fancy restaurant. In fact for the amazing pizza they put out, there are some oddities on the menu - like chicken wings and french fries. I think they're trying to please too wide a clientele. 

So, don't expect a Mark McEwan or Susur Lee restaurant, but damn, they make a fine wood fired pizza!"}
{"text":"I live in the Beach and love it that we have so many great restaurants. But with all that competition a restaurant needs to bring their A - game every day. Too bad about Viccinos. 

The ambiance is good. The wood-fired pizza oven brings life into the room even when it's mostly empty. But the service was indifferent and the food was bad. 

It's Thursday around 6:30, and I'm out with my teen son. There are only 2 other tables seated when we arrive. Our server was polite, but he just wasn't interested in us. He had something going on with a guy in the kitchen. 

We both ordered pasta dishes. Since there was a bolognese sauce and also a meat sauce option, I asked what was in the bolognese sauce. The server didn't know. I told him I just wanted a tomato sauce with meat in it. (what it was called on the menu didn't matter) 

About 20 minutes later I asked our waiter to check on our order. My order arrived 5 minutes later. My pasta was luke warm and overcooked. They gave me tomato sauce instead of meat sauce. They gave me penne instead of spaghetti. And my son's order didn't come for another 5 minutes after that.  

My son's fettucine and meatballs was delicious, hot and perfectly cooked. 
I know, I ate half of it. 

I'd love to have a great place for pasta in the Beach. If you find one, let me know."}
{"text":"Seriously fresh, super tasty pie.
Kind of pizza that makes your day.
Top 3 crusts in the city + the veggie options are original.
Service is speedy and friendly. 
This should be your go to neighborhood pizza-pie delivery!"}
{"text":"Veccino's is a relatively new addition to the Beaches neighbourhood. They make fantastic wood oven pizzas. There are about a dozen varieties on their menu, or you can create your own.

The staff was very accommodating when we requested a pizza that was half one type, and half another.

They have a really good deal where you can get a medium pizza, 10 chicken wings, 2 pops and a large salad for $25."}
{"text":"YUM!! I love a wood-oven pizza!
We walked in around 1pm on a Saturday. We were told that the oven still wasn't quite up to temperature for the pizza, but he could make us appetizers and salad right away. We were in no rush, so no biggie. I ordered a garlic bread w/cheese. Deeelish! The perfect balance of crunch and squish. 
We ordered a large pizza split half & half down the middle with different toppings, and it as not a problem at all. It came to the table hot hot hot and lookin' good. I like my pizza pretty plain usually. Good sauce, good cheese, and the thin crust is my fave!!
I'm all about supporting the local business, and this place was great :)

Quick tip: they deliver or do take-out as well!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  Simply terrible.   This reminds me why I don't venture east of Coxwell (aka l'il Mississauga) to eat.   I rode my bike past this place the other day and decided to try again in the beaches.   Bad move.   Ryan L either went to a different restaurant or has a different standard than me.

The facts: 

* no license.   Don't open a sit-down restaurant if you aren't ready
* the menu: plastic-coated, never-changing beaches menus
* the pizza: soggy crust, cooked for several minutes vs. 90 seconds.  Covered in cheapish toppings and covered in dried oregano.  Am I at the Olive Garden here?
* The BO: The waitress almost made me gag when she reached in front of me with her unfloral pits
* The competence: no chili oil, no oil, tiny basil leaves on a margerita.  It's like they've never been to a real pizza place
* The service: 3 waiters, 4 tables, and 10 mins to get someone's attention
* The layout: cord carpet and a huge unused bar in the middle of the place makes it feel out of place

Take it from me, stay west of Coxwell - go to Queen Margherita or Lil Baci.   Both of them are excellent, well-run, and a good experience."}
{"text":"After perusing the food offerings along Queen, my friend decided he wanted to try this place out and I agreed. The smell wafting out the door was mouthwatering, so we walked inside to get us some yummy pizza.

We sat down at an empty table and perused the menu... for a solid 10 minutes... before anyone approached us. We had already decided what we wanted so we ordered the special with a pizza, salad and wings and two pops included. At $23 plus tax for this meal, it looked like we were in for some good eats. We also ordered garlic bread from the appetizer menu as we were pretty hungry and wanted to get a sense of what other stuff on the menu was like.

Our waiter brought us two pops (in a can... which I found a bit weird for a sit down eatery) and the garlic bread after a bit. The garlic bread wasn't good at all... a bit burnt, not too garlicky, overall nothing special. 

Our caesar salad came and I was so incredibly disappointed. It looked exactly like it tasted; soggy and comparable to something from Mrs. Vanellis in a mall food court. First off: who uses baby romaine lettuce with a heavy creamy caesar dressing!? Everything tasted and looked like it had been prepackaged. Prepackaged croutons, prepackaged \"grated\" parmesean cheese and prepackaged bacon. Like I said, comparable to something from a mall food court. It's pretty hard to screw up a caesar salad, but these guys managed to do it.

The wings we got were honey garlic and were okay... they were small in size and some of them were burnt, but they did fall off the bone. As per most wings I get at non-wing restaurants, they could have used quite a bit more sauce.

The pizza was quite good but by this point in the meal, I was so disappointed that it just didn't do it for me. We got a fairly simple pizza with procutto, pepperoni and ham and while the crust was great, there wasn't much else going on. 

It wasn't terribly busy, people wandering in here and there with kids in tow, but the service was terrible. If you don't want my business, then close your doors. Don't give me crappy service if you're not interested in making money. *sigh*

Overall, it was a decent meal for the money but I wouldn't go back. I'm sure there are better places to get pizza in the Beaches and definitely elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"Edit #2 (Oct 18, 2010): Walked by the place the other day and it appears they've finally gotten their liquor license approved!

Edit: I would take with a grain of salt the reviews of people who several times in their review badmouth the entire region east of Coxwell.  That sort of review makes me suspicious the person has more of an issue with the neighbourhood in general than they do with this particular restaurant.

Addendum (Sept 21,2010):

I have returned once to this restaurant and ordered a pizza and garlic bread for take out.  again, the pizza and garlic bread were fantastic.  The bread they cook right in the oven along side the pizzas.  They were quite busy that night and despite the guy quoting me about 15 minutes for the pizza it ended up being around 20.  I made no indications I was bothered by this delay (it was understandable considering how busy they were) .  But regardless, the guy who I assume was either the owner or manager was very apologetic and even offered to toss in a free Caesar salad for the measly 5 minute wait. 

I'll be moving closer to this area in the coming months and can't wait to be able to frequent this place more often. 

Original Review:

This pizza place has only opened up as of 4 or 5 days ago, but they've already made an impression on me.  The wood-fired pizza made in a huge brick oven has a thin, chewy, but still crispy crust that is reminiscent of a particularly famous pizzeria in Manhattan.  The sauce?  Maybe even more delicious.

But perhaps I'm just influenced by the weak and simple tomato sauces that most Toronto pizza places (chains and indy places alike) offer.

We ordered two pizzas.  On one of them we accidentally screwed up our order (our fault, not theirs; the items on the menu were numbered, we gave them the wrong number).  And despite it not being what we were hoping for (and I probably wouldn't have ordered that style of pizza as it wasn't really my preference) it was still some of the best Pizza I've had in a really long time.

They're a little disorganized right now, but I can't hold that against them since they're only 4 or 5 days old.  Holding that against them within the first month would be against countless food critic 'codes of ethics' anyways.

As of this writing they are still lacking a bar (awaiting licencing I'm guessing) , their delivery driver hadn't started yet (I was told that they'd be starting the 18th...but don't hold me to that) and their menu has a couple typos, but these are all minor things that will get sorted I'm sure in the next few weeks."}
