{"text":"This is one of my regular go-to spots for lunch. There is often a wait, but if you're willing to share a table with others, the wait is no more than 10 minutes. The owner at cash is always smiling and the service is fast. As others have said, you serve yourself with tea towards the back of the room. We usually have the wonton noodles with the greens. The wontons are huge and full of shrimp and the greens are tasty with oyster sauce on the side. For 6 dollars, this place is great value and a great alternative to many of the fast food joints.  Note, this place only accepts cash."}
{"text":"Best Shrimp wonton & soup!  We ordered some soups and the vegi to go.  It was fast and HOT.  Cash only but 2 can dine for under $20. :-)"}
{"text":"A delicious, no frills, friendly and affordable place for soup. The waitress  (owner?) Was fun to talk with and very good at explaining the menu. Prices have gone up since some others have posted.  I think the highest price item was $8.  Portions are enough to fill a hungry man.

As the waitress said, this is the kind of food that you would find in a traditional Cantonese home.  It's been there for 20 years and was in Hong Kong for many years prior."}
{"text":"My favorite wonton place. All dishes are good
I get their wonton flat noodle soup w/ beef & dace fish balls. Vegetable plate on the side. Sometimes get lost mein."}
{"text":"Jim Chai Kee is everything a good wonton noodle place should be, quick, affordable, delicious, and absolutely no frills. Highly highly recommended! :) 

But be warned, this place is by no means one for the fine dining experience. There are about 10 tables, and the turnover is ridiculously fast. In and out in under 20 mins (maybe 15 if you can eat really fast!). A great spot if you want to grab a quick lunch, but not if you're looking to stay and chat. And don't expect service other than for the waiter to take your order and hand you a bill. Even tea and water is in a self serve carafe at the back of the restaurant.

To add to ordering efficiency, the menu is as uncomplicated as it gets, with only a few options. I always end up ordering the same thing, and literally within a minute of ordering, the food starts arriving. 

The portions don't seem like it would satisfy when it first arrives, but underneath those four giant shrimp wontons is a generous serving of perfectly cooked noodles. The broth is clean, and everything is just the way a bowl of wonton noodles should be. You've never had shrimp wontons until you've had them here. They are jam packed with whole shrimps, none of that ground up paste of mystery seafood.

Definitely stop by for a try if you're in the Richmond Hill area!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to contribute to the positive reviews. This is the perfect place for one of my fave comfort foods: shrimp wonton soup! 

Though it's not an ideal spot for a fancy dinner (see others' reviews of decor), it's definitely worth a visit for a quick, basic meal. The service is fast, the prices are low, the food is reliable and the wonton are delicious."}
{"text":"Best wonton noodle soup place in R.Hill.  These wontons are huge - larger than golf balls and always fresh.  Shrimp had a \"snap\" to them and definitely the jumbo premium shrimps.  A must try

We've taken home a dozen of the uncooked wontons for $9 and made it for the following day."}
{"text":"Nice cheap eat,like fast food,it's busy for lunch hour but people have it done quickly so not long wait. Down side is no service,you have to get tea by yourself"}
{"text":"A great wonton noodle place 

We ordered the 'Signature Noodle' 

We'd definitely go back to try the other dishes !"}
{"text":"This place have been around forever. At least twenty years I think! Excellent shrimp wonton and the noodles is perfect. Service is lightening speed fast. You'll be out in 10-15 minutes if you eat fast! For under $5, how can you say NO!!?"}
{"text":"One of the best wonton noodle place in Toronto! The owner is super friendly and makes you feel welcome and the service is fast.  You do have to get your own tea but they make up for it by having very reasonable prices.  Limited menu but they focus on what they do best - wonton noodles.  The wontons are giant but yet juicy and bouncy.  The fish balls are great too.  Chili oil is good but be warned it is super spicy.  The noodle soup base is also very tasty.  Overall a great wonton noodle house with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Awesome shrimp wonton soup!  A very basic restaurant.  The best part is the service is so fast, food is tasty, and price is reasonable.  In and out in 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I was in Markham for some work training. Came here because I wanted some cheap and delicious food. This place definitely fit the bill and wasn't a disappointment. With the uniquely large wontons and fish balls this place is the quick and easy place for wonton noodle soup. My order came out about as soon as I ordered it! Talk about fast food done right. place is cash only FYI"}
{"text":"Great food, quick and delicious 
Simple but has all the best fresh ingredients 
Best service when G is around 
Oh... I highly recommend wonton only"}
{"text":"This is the best wonton noodle place ever!!! Large shrimp wontons and fast friendly service! We have become regulars and been eating here for over 10 years!! Cheap tasty noodles whether you like lo mein or soup!"}
{"text":"The menu is basically limited to wontons and a side of veggies. If you're looking for a simple quick tasty meal this is the place to come.   The wontons here are huge and not full of fillers.  Mine had a ton of shrimp in it that you can actually see.  The broth was also nice and subtle.  The inside is a little dated but it was clean and the food was good.  Too bad they close so early (8pm)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food at cheap prices with super fast no frill service.I usually get wonton noodles as wontons are huge and tasty.Drinks are self serve.The other toppings for noodle soup include- sliced beef and fishballs. Both of which are mediocre in taste. I am a fan of their house chili sauce and XO sauce and usually get a bottle for home. Overall a pleasant experience for chinese comfort food."}
{"text":"Awesome shrimp wonton noodles that take less than a minute to serve from when you order! Very good chilli oil as well!!"}
{"text":"Simple but tasty noodle combinations, with fantastic service and a homey feel. The shrimp dumplings are delicious and I learned the hard way how spicy their homemade chilli oil is. Great place for families to come - they accommodated my two young children and made us feel completely welcome despite the tornado effect that comes with a five year old and a baby."}
{"text":"If you need a cheap lunch this is the place to go. My family and I go (3 people total) on weekends it comes out to about 18 dollars for 3 bowls of soup and 2 drinks. You can be in and out of the restaurant in under half an hour which is a pretty good if you ask me. The guy at the front is one of the happiest people i have ever seen, he just smiles and smiles like nothing could ever bother him. Oh yeah keep in mind that you may need to share a table with someone during peak hours.

 I had recently broken my ankle during a skateboarding accident and when we walked in for lunch they got me a chair to sit and wait even though the wait wasn't long and sat me at a seat with easy access which was amazing!

 If you like hot sauce and i mean hot than you should try theirs it is quite hot so keep that in mind. 

The only downfall about this place is the parking it is absolutely nuts."}
{"text":"Shrimp wontons can't get any better!
Feb 2016 - work lunch."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful thing to not have to drive 30+ minutes for a soothing bowl of wonton noodle soup for brunch.  

Perhaps that was the cause for my enjoyment, but the tender shrimp stuffed within each wonton shell were delicious til the bottom of my bowl (which I don't think I really reached, but came pretty darn close!).  

And also took note of the all 'round Christmas decorations ;-)"}
{"text":"good value. not much service but doesn't require much. you get your own water. 
good quick bite to have. wontons are huge too!"}
{"text":"If you like wonton soup and shrimp, give this place a try - a truly hidden gem...  The menu is simple and short but the value and taste is awesome.  For an extra special look on how the wontons are made, drop by early morning and watch them being made while you enjoy eating them.  Also available at the door frozen by the 1/2 dozen... Good for keeping in your freezer. Watch lunch time - it's crazy busy."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem. Their broth is phenomenal and the wontons plump and juicy. The noodles are fine and firm and have a nice bite to them. Add some soy sauce, some of their hot pepper oil, and you've got an insanely delicious bowl of soup. I once made my father drive me here when I had a serious head cold, all the way from Etobicoke, just to have a bowl of this stuff. Gotta love their communal tea vat in the back, and the fact they don't write down your order - they just scream it to the back of the kitchen. So cheap, so fresh, so fast. I would recommend JCK everyone.  Hands down best wonton noodle soup I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service. Won tons are really good quality and they are very filling. I had the shrimp wontons and beef with noodle in soup and the noodles were good, the broth is not too oily, the beef was very soft and tender."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, tasty wontons, and very fast!!! If you're short on time, definitely hit up this noodle joint!"}
{"text":"The food is average and I know the service is non existent already. 
That's not even the concern. 

They don't actually close at 8. The kitchen closes at 7:30. We walked in for food, but was told it was cash only. We went to get cash across the street and came back. When we came back we  were told that it was closed. How hard is it for a kitchen to cook up two bowls of wonton noodles. 

Get with the times and get a debit card machine and stop cheating taxes."}
{"text":"Good food, fast and friendly service. My favourite is A1 on the menu. The place gets very busy during lunch hours but the wait time is not that long. Customers eat fast here."}
{"text":"Biggest won tons with real shrimp you can see and huge fish balls where you can taste real fish!  Egg noodles cooked to perfection.  Food appears almost as soon as you order.  Great value and quality!"}
{"text":"This place never lets me down when I'm in the mood for wonton noodle soup.  Great price, simple menu, good quality food."}
{"text":"Great- quick lunch with the kids. Feels family run. Went there to see just how fast, but they didn't have their game on- took a whole 4 minutes to get all our food :)

There were really nice to the kids-  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Like everyone else mentioned, giant shrimp wontons! Egg noodles were thinner than most of the places I've been too but was good textured. 

The menu is limited with 3 types of toppings and noodles so if you're looking for a huge variety there are other options in the plaza. I'd definitely come back if I were feeling for wontons--good quality, great value and friendly service."}
{"text":"Come here strictly for the wonton soup only! 

The food (4/5): Noodles are al dente, and the wontons are huge! Wontons are filled with large shrimp and the wonton wrapper holds its own. Love the soup here, will def be back. I'd warn against getting anything other than the wontons though, especially the beef... The beef is really chewy and frankly not the best cut. The Gai Lan is a nice to have on the side, but again, nothing special than what you can prepare for yourself at home lol. Wontons all the way! Last tip, their hot chilli oil is LEGIT. By legit, i mean REALLY HOT. If you want to add it to your soup , do so in small amounts. Test it first because I put in too much the first time... and had to order another soup because I was an idiot and misjudged the oil lol.

Price (4.5/5): $5 for awesome giant wontons in noodle soup?! Its a steal for a quick and hearty meal!

Service (4/5): Straight and right to the point. In and out is their style. Nothing to complain about here, pretty standard Chinese service :) They only serve soup and Gai Lan here so you'll get your food REALLY quick! Just a note that the water and tea is self serve (it's at the back!)

Ambience (3.5/5): Their walls are lined with a repeating menu of soups and the tables are pretty plain. It's a decent size for larger groups and as clean as a standard Chinese restaurant. Nothing to complain about here!"}
{"text":"Had my first and definitely not my last visit today.  Ordered Wonton (shrimp) and beef egg noodle soup.  Also ordered half veggie plate, but it was added to my soup, which I wasn't expecting.  The outcome was delicious! And the self serve tea station (or hot water) was a fantastic idea! (No charge)"}
{"text":"\"The one where the food arrived on our tables less than a minute after ordering\"

The Good:
Blistering fast arrival of food; fast but satisfying meal; large tasty jumbo wontons, good price

The Bad:
Service could be better (everything is self-serve including getting your own tea); servings could be a little larger

Overview:
After a long morning occupied by a 4 hour meeting, my coworker and I decided to go for something tasty but at the same time fast as we were expecting some e-mails back at work so we decided to come here. Been here many times before but first time for my coworker. We entered the main door, asked for a table of two and sat down. The menus were in plastic menu stands on each table and was quite limited in terms of what you can get. Wonton noodles in soup, Sliced Beef noodles in soup, Fish Ball noodles in soup and combinations of them (could have been more but these were generally the ones I can remember). Of course, they're known for their wonton noodles in soup so we each ordered one of these. Each was $4.50. We also decided to share a dish of Chinese vegetables (was either $2.50 or $3.50, can't remember). Right after the waitress took our order I told my coworker about how getting tea is self-serve so we walked towards the corner with the Styrofoam cups and tea. Even before I could start filling up my cup via self-serve, our vegetables had arrived at our table. Wow. As were joking about how fast it was, the wonton noodles in soup arrived right after, before I even sat down. Wow. Talk about fast service. Did this mean the food wasn't fresh? Not at all. I've been there many times, once at 11AM and I've seen them preparing the wontons for their typical lunch time servings. They'd sit in one of the main tables where customers normally sat and wrap wontons. I once asked how fresh the wontons were and they answered that the \"lunch time\" wontons are prepared ~11:00AM for lunch servings up to 1:30PM. They basically have them prepared, get a bowl, scoop up the noodles and soup and add the wontons so your food's ready in less than 2 minutes. 

Noodles themselves were quite tasty and the soup base was your typical wonton noodle soup. The wontons themselves were different from others in that they were huge! Stuffed with shrimp, they give you 4 and I found them to be quite tasty. Vegetables were normal with a side dish of oyster sauce; nothing special but it goes well with the wonton noodles since the oyster sauce is salty and some may find (i.e. my coworker) the soup to be a little bland. Right after ordering, the waiter writes your bill and hands it to you. You go to the cashier with it when you're ready to leave, so technically they're not really waiters. Bill came out to be $7 each. 

Place itself isn't really that large, it mainly has tables accommodating parties of 2-6, but then again I doubt this would be a place you'd want to bring a large party to sit down, catch up and just talk since your food would arrive and you'd be done in less than 15 minutes. 

Overall, a pretty decent quick bite. Good for those in a rush (like we were) and if you really love shrimp then you should definitely give their wontons a try. Just don't expect the best (if any) service.

{"text":"Wontons are their specialty, big juicy tasty shrimp wontons. Fast service. Humble interior. Watch out, the hot oil is sweat inducing spicy!"}
{"text":"I was craving shrimp wonton soup and so I stumbled upon this joint after doing a quick Yelp search for the best wontons in Richmond Hill. 

The place is pretty no frills such as with many Chinese establishments. Basic tables and chairs and no decor. But who goes to Chinese places for the ambiance anyways?

The basic wonton noodle soup ($4.50) comes with one topping (choice of shrimp wontons, fish balls, or beef). Although I was craving just shrimp wontons, the temptation of variety took over, and I added a second topping (fish balls) for an additional 50 cents. 

In my bowl came two shrimp wontons and three fish balls. Had I ordered one topping, I would have had four shrimp wontons, regret immediately set in. The feeling of regret was more immense after I tasted the fish balls. They were large, seasoned well and looked like they were made from scratch but they were way too fishy for my liking!  I thought non-fresh fish scraps. I shuddered. Aargh, gross. Fortunately, the shrimp wontons were tasty especially with a splash of red vinegar. The wonton noodles were pretty standard along with the MSG soup. 

It's self serve tea here but can you complain with bowls starting at $4.50?  I will be back the next time I have a shrimp wonton fix."}
{"text":"I dream about these dumplings in my sleep. The broth is so delicate and delicious. Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"I ordered the lo mein with everything (beef, fishballs, wontons).  The beef and fish balls were pretty ordinary but as others have mentioned, the wontons are really good.  The workers there were very friendly and the food came lightning fast.  It was a good experience and I'll definitely be back for the wontons!"}
{"text":"I come every week or two for lunch. Very crowded, so recommend you arrive at 11:30 am or 1:30 pm. Shrimp wontons with egg noodles in soup is my favourite but all the dishes are good. Large portions. Awesome house-made chilli oil adds the right amount of heat."}
{"text":"Limited menu, but they focus on what they do best - wonton noodles. The wontons are giant but yet juicy and bouncy. The fish balls are great too. I love the soup base and their very cheap, affordable."}
{"text":"BEST WONTONS EVER. Hands down. Large, plump, juicy, flavorful shrimp exploding from each one. Don't bother with any other noodle toppings--a mistake we made in attempt to diversify our food selection. Just straight up wonton noodles all the way for everyone. You'll thank me later. Very reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Came here with family on a Sunday afternoon, welcomed us with bright smiles. The place is pretty old, not a fancy place at all. You actually have to get your tea yourself, which is a first to me.

The food. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the menu is VERY limited. You basically have a choice of fish, shrimp, chicken, or all three type of wontons. Wontons only or with noodles? And they have one side of Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. 

I highly recommend the shrimp wonton with noodle for a surprisingly $4.50!! Trust me when I say you get money's worth. For about another $2.00 you can get the Chinese broccoli, which are a nice green side to a wonton soup. Also, just a warning... Their hot sauce is spicier than other places. They make their own and also sell it in jars. Anyways, I recommend having it n the side and dipping your wontons in it. Delicious!  

I know their chairs and tables may be old and you may have to get your own tea but the wonton noodle soup are so worth it :) 

Enjoy !"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this little joint of a gem today and after a year of waiting it did not disappoint. Amazing customer service and amazing food. The shrimp wonton was delicious, they do not skimp out on the shrimp as that ball is packed with seafood heaven! What made this place even better was their hot chili oil. I have not tasted any other hot chili oil better than this one. I had to buy a jar for home. I will definitely come back for more!! 5 star all the way!"}
{"text":"Soup base, wontons all yummy. Service friendly. Food comes out fast. 

I might skip the fish calls next time as they look and tasted like it was spooned out of the fish paste they sell at the grocery store. Next time going to go for pure wontons. 

Try the chili oil. It looks like they make own as they sell them by the jar at the counter. Almost bought one as the chili tasted really good. There's a different flavor in it that I can't quite put my finger on. 

Would recommend if u r in the area and looking for a cheap and quick eat. They have 2 locations."}
{"text":"The owner is amazingly friendly. 

The food is cheap, extremely good and large portions! Can't ask for anything more. On top of that the owner is really friendly! Greets you on the way in and takes your order and answers questions with ease. 

The food was amazing. The portions were extremely large. Lots of noodles, soup and the size of the wontons and fish balls were HUGE. The shrimp wonton is about the size of a small plum. It was hard to finish so I even brought some home. 

The soup had a ton of flavour but the wonton was lacking. The soup made up for it and taking a sip of the broth before and after eating the wonton gave it just as much flavour as the soup. The fish ball had a lot of flavour though. 
There was MSG in the broth, I could taste it right away. However it only added flavour to the broth and improved it."}
{"text":"Of all the years I've been visiting, I've found this place to be amazingly consistent place to go to for wonton noodles.

Service is always astoundingly fast, and the food is also delicious. Although, the one thing I moderately dislike (although I've generally come to accept) about the presentation is that the noodles are generally placed on top of the wontons; while it doesn't look as pretty compared to putting the wontons on top, this presentation style is more functional, as it allows the noodles to not become soggy as fast, so you get that nice bite.

Definitely an awesome place to eat at, would definitely recommend, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"What a deal! The food was really good ...I will be back for sure!
They forgot to bring me my tea, but when I mentioned that they just gave me it for free on the way out the door lol"}
{"text":"I would recommend the filling shrimp wonton to anyone! 
The beef was just okay though. 
Minus 1 star because the server tried to squeeze me and my friend to share the table with another couple. Apparently, it is a very common thing in Asia street food vendors, not in Canada. It would have been nice if the sever asked first. That couple definitely wasn't happy about it lol.
Beside that, I've been coming back to this place so many times for good and cheap wonton noodle soup."}
{"text":"If I didn't have a Wonton Chai Noodle by my house, I may have found this place to be delicious. However, it definitely pales in comparison to Wonton Chai!

The prices are cheaper by approximately $0.50, and the noodles are noticeably thinner. However, they're also not cooked as al dente and, although not very mushy, definitely lack the springy bite characteristic of Wonton Chai. At the same time, their broth is not as rich and may contain MSG (having consumed about half the bowl of soup, my mom became quite thirsty). Moreover, there is some alkaline taste to the noodles - although this is very slight and minimal. Finally, the portions are smaller - and an extra $1 provides two toppings but there's only one extra topping given, whereas Wonton Chai Noodle offers the same additional portion for an extra $0.50 only.

On the other hand, I didn't find their broth to be as salty. The dace fish balls were also not as salty, and the wontons were very tasty as well! I have slight gluten sensitivity, but wasn't very affected by Jim Chai Kee. 
 
Overall, a decent place, and I liked it! However, it's just that when compared with Wonton Chai, my family enjoys Wonton Chai more."}
{"text":"Jim Chai Kee has a great menu served in an instant! The wonton noodles are arguably the best item on the menu, for $7. The serving sizes are normal, but the restraunt's menu has plenty of cheap and affordable prices to offer. The quality of the food is undeniably great."}
{"text":"Ordered a wonton noodle along with veggies that comes with oyster sauce. The food came out very fast. They have many varieties of noodle soups. You get tea yourself. Cheap prices! The portion was good as well. Very big wontons which is a plus!"}
{"text":"WOW, the wontons are huge!  Each wonton is about the size of a meatball from Hey Meatballs and is filled with probably 5 shrimps in each ball.  And there are about 4 of them in a bowl for the cost of $5!  Talk about value.  This is a great little place for fast food and I mean FAST, like getting your meal less than a 1 minute after you order.  The downside is you have to walk to the back to serve yourself tea or hot water and there are no napkins on the table itself."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap, fast and good food, then this is the place! With just a handful of food items, the owners managed to create a dozen or so options.
The wontons are the size of a baby's fist and there's no fillers, it's all shrimp baby! The beef seems freshly sliced and silky smooth. The fish balls are my favorite, they've got the right \"bounce\" when  you bite into them.
Beware of the hot chili oil, it's hot stuff! A little goes a long way and you wouldn't want too much to spoil/ruin an already tasty bowl of noodles."}
{"text":"This place has been in Toronto for a looooong time. Each time I drive up from New Jersey, I always pay Jim Chai Kee a visit. Simple, affordable and tasty are the key ingredients to the long lasting success of this restaurant. 

Simple: Menu only has 3 toppings: ping pong ball's size wonton (all shrimps), beef and fish paste. 3 kinds of noodles: egg noodles, rice noodle and vermicelli. It can be served in 2 different styles: soup or no soup. 

Affordable: Most expensive item on the menu is $8. 

If I live in Toronto, this will be my \"live to eat\" place. I think I can survive on a bowl of wonton noodles daily!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while driving from Windsor to Toronto. Including the detour from the 401 this was still faster than stopping at an enRoute and the total for two people for lunch including tax and tip was $15.

The service is friendly if a bit rushed. Can't really blame them, the are only four items on the menu. Once you order the food comes out outrageously quickly. The only comparable experience is actually having prepared food for yourself and only needing to carry it to the table. 

Hot water and tea are self serve at the back. If you go back after you've ordered the food might make it to your table first. Cold drinks are in a cooler and must be ordered. 

The wontons are very tasty. I had the wonton noodle soup ($4.50) and vegetables (Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, $2.50) he had the wonton lomein ($5.00), which comes with soup. There's a great hot sauce on the table, but it is quite spicy. Great in the soup and on sale for $7/jar at the cash. 

You'll have to go up to pay. This is a great find for us as we make this drive often. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick bite and are in a rush to do something or go somewhere, this place is perfect for these situations. Once you ordered, your order will be served in a couple of minutes, which amazes me. They are faster than any local fast food restaurant! 

The menu is simple as they are a noodle shop. I ordered the egg noodles with fish balls. The broth is not extremely hot but the noodles are pretty good. I am a person who cannot handle spiciness. I added three drops of their XO chili sauce and my mouth was immediately on fire. They have quite the XO chili sauce and you can even purchase a jar so you can use it at home. You can also take home their wontons. 

The only service you will get is when you order and the employees serving you your food. You have to get the tea and hot water at the back by yourself. Also, if it gets busy and only big tables are free, you will have to most likely share a table with another party. 

So basically, this place is a place for eating and leaving immediately after you finish eating your noodles."}
{"text":"plump golfball sized shrimp wontons! delicious wonton soup. can't get this taste in Philly or NYC anymore so when meetings bring me back into the GTA, I make a detour here.  

get an order of wonton (with or without noodles), add some chili oil and you are in business.  as others have noted, bring cash and if considering this place for dinner stop by early as they close at 8pm."}
{"text":"It's amazing!! Speedy service, huge golf ball sized wontons, broth is so tasty and the noodles are cooked to perfection. My go to wonton restaurant for a quick bite, cheap price, but you need to pour your own tea and hot water at the drink station."}
{"text":"If you like wonton this is the place for you.  They are huge and I am not lying.  They prepare the noodle so quickly and the price is decent.  Nothing to complain about this place."}
{"text":"The restaurant serves mainly wonton noodles. The noodles are amazing the soup is amazing and the wonton is amazing. I usually have the wonton and beef noodle soup with a side of vegetables. The hot chili oil sauce is very very spicy. I would recommend trying their homemade chili oil and heck if you like it you can buy it from the counter. The place follows traditional HK street style service where you serve yourself tea and take the bill up to the cashier to pay when you finish.

This place is a must visit if you are ever in or passing by Richmond hill."}
{"text":"Wonton (shrimp) egg noodle soup. Simple yet great taste, recommended by staff and excellent. 

At table kind staff member brought a bowl and mixed red vinegar and a chilli oil, and motioned to dip shrimp ball in. Excellent!! Added another flavour dimension. 

Don't be fooled by plaza location."}

Pros:
- Very cheap eats

Cons:
- Small menu
- Bland food"}
{"text":"Probably best on a cold day. Jim Chai Kee Noodle is a small place on the north side of Highway 7 among many Asian finds. I am not Asian, but love their cuisine. This place offers Wonton Noodle Soup. Not much else. But their soup is hot and tasty. Let alone cheap! Someone wrote that there are five wontons in the bowl....hmm, maybe I got ripped off. Only four in mine. But, they were huge! Filled with the equivalent of 2.5 shrimp. Noodles a plentiful in the bowl as well. You can order the same with meat in it if you like. Pretty much just variations of this warming bowl of soup. We also get a plate of the greens, (Chinese brocolli?) with some oyster sauce on the side. Nice addition. You get your own cup of tea at the back. One per person! LOL! If you snuck a second cup I'm sure it would be ok. Nice people run this place. English is not a first language, but it doesn't matter.

{"text":"All round good place for fast yummy food! Service is quick and so is their turn over rate. When it gets busy you will have to share a table. But its fine since people come and go real quick. Its almost like a fast food restaurant! Tea and water is self serve.

Compared to before their broth has slipped a bit. There certainly tastes like there's more MSG. the vegetables for 2.50$ is definitely A LOT smaller than before. They call it a personal portion. But it amounts to about five small stems and five leaves. 

Don't get me wrong though, the food is still delicious. the wonton is PACKED with flavour and shrimp. The fish balls are alright. Nothing too special. Spongey and soft with a bit of chewyness.

 I will definitely be back when I am looking for a quick bite! Prices are also reasonable!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday around 2 in the afternoon, it was quite busy but nothing out of the ordinary, there wasn't even a lineup at the door. When the food was served, instantly, we noticed the quality of the food slipped, marked by the sogginess of the noodle, a wonton that's broken into half, and soup that's barely half filled in the bowl (yet, they still managed to make the noodle soggy). After we finished our meal, we went up to the cashier to pay, and asked politely if they have a new chef, implying the food quality went down. The lady sensed where we were going with our question, and replied without hesitation, in the exact wording, \"don't expect too much from us on a busy day. It was so busy today, we didn't have time to do anything else. If you expect too much on a busy day like this, you will never get what you want.\" ... WOW. Just WOW. MIND = BLOWN. Not so much by the quality of their food (be it extremely good or ridiculously bad), but by their unreceptive attitude towards their customers' comments and feedbacks. 

They do not deserve the high rating after all, for they have so much confidence in their production, that they ignored the ACTUAL quality of their food, and eaters' opinions about them. Had she replied differently, perhaps by offering her apologies by briefly explaining how the influx of customers had affected the way things were handled in the kitchen, we would have understood it completely. But when they can't keep up with their food quality (for one good reason, it was getting busy), nor can they keep their customers informed, that's when they lose business. 

It was one of our favourite spots in the area, but it's such a shame that we can ever say the same again."}
{"text":"To start things off, wonton noodle has been my childhood favourites, and Jim Chai Kee really is able to deliver that familiar flavours with lightning speed.  The noodles are always on point with 4 wonderful fresh shrimp wontons and a lightly flavoured fish stock.  The tea is self serve, and the price was just wonderful at $5 plus tax.  As soon as I sat down, my order was taken.  It took less than 2 minutes for the order to arrive and the choy sum was tasty with the oyster sauce.  I am really satisifed with the quality, price and speed.  Not much more I can ask for."}
{"text":"We wanted something light for dinner since we were heading to the movies later that evening and that certainly implies an indulgence in junk food. 

Whenever I am asked to choose a meal, my answer is almost always \"Let's have noodles!\" I even get made fun of for it, but I can't help it. It's my fave.

 I choose Jim Chai Kee because it was on the way to Richmond Hill Silvercity and I've been trying to have my girlfriend out to try what I consider a great Wonton place. I've been coming to this place since my High School years, not much has changed, same staff, decoration, and food. 

We've ordered a bowl of wonton and fish ball mein, a bowl of wonton and fish ball ho fun, Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, pop, and jar of chili oil for $22.00. 

The flavour and taste is just as I remember, wonton filled with large shrimps and fish ball minced to perfection. You can tell, once you bite into it there's so much texture and bounce (there's a Chinese saying that I can't translate) the broth is delicious and not overly salty but still with a really good strong flavour."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0

One of many locations that they own with this one being their flagship location. Perfect place for a quick lunch if you're looking for a simple yet very satisfying bowl of wonton, beef or fish ball noodle soup."}
{"text":"The shrimp wonton are a must have. Super cheap too and make sure to help yourself to the self serve free tea at the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Wontons I've ever had!
Worst Fish balls I've ever had! Very fishy but I had to try it given that it was one of their signature items.

Mom who is from Hong Kong gave their noodles a raving review, quite a feat if you knew my Mom heheh

First place we visited in Toronto and was surprised at the time they were closing.  By 8pm you better finish and be leaving or the lady servers may become rude, what I mean is MORE rude. Haha just kidding, not really, honestly they were ok.  Being from NY where 6pm - 12midnight is a regular dinner window, being kicked out before 8pm was sort of amusing to me.

Self serve tea and water,  what do the waitresses do again?  I jest, they were really nice in a traditional Chinese local eatery sort of way.  You have to grow up with it to be totally ok with it."}
{"text":"The place to get your wonton noodles fix. Fast, inexpensive, no frills kinda place. You have to pour your own tea at the tea station. I usually get the signature A1 on the menu with fishball, beef and wonton. The beef is tender, and the wontons are massive. And also try their housemade chili sauce. Be warned that it is super spicy!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying wonton soup, I loved it !
As soon as we arrived we sat down and a couple minutes later asked us our orders and no more than 1 minute later our food was on the table. So right away I was impressed. The place was not that busy when we arrived but within 10 minutes most tables were filling up.
Everything on the menu is a great price very very affordable. The noodles and soup were decent nothing to complain about and the wontons were pretty good I loved the shrimp inside. I did add the spivey sauce they have on the table which made the soup a lot more enjoyable and I have to add - a little goes a long way- This place also has self serve tea 
Overall this place is fast and is great for if you want something satisfying and fast and inexpensive to eat."}
{"text":"Ever since V2 at First Markham Place closed down (which was many years ago!), this has become our go-to place for wonton noodles. A number of wonton noodle shops have popped up since, but none of them beats Jim Chai Kee in my opinion. 

The speed of service is quite impressive and reminds me of eateries in Hong Kong. Typically, our order includes a plate of vegetables with oyster sauce ($2.5), which arrives within a minute or two from the time we order. The noodles come shortly after, and we are usually done our meal within 30 to 45 minutes. The broth is clear, light yet full of flavour and always comes pipping hot. The restaurant fills the bowls with soup only 3/4 of the way to avoid overcooking the noodles. In traditional establishments (these are even hard to find in Hong Kong now), wonton noodles are served with a spoon at the bottom of a small bowl, stacked with wontons, and finally topped with noodles to avoid soaking it in the soup for too long. 

There are only 3 toppings available (wontons, sliced beef and dace fish balls) and you can mix and match as you wish ($8 for all 3 toppings, $7 for 2 toppings and $6 for 1 topping). Because the menu is small and concise, the quality is always consistent. I definitely prefer this place over Wonton Chai (Unionville location) as I find that their toppings and broth tend to be on the salty side. Plus, the wontons just aren't as good. As for Wonton Hut (Warden and Hwy 7), I do enjoy their broth, although I find their portions really small and their price points are slightly higher. 

A few things to keep in mind when visiting:
- This place only accepts cash and you will need to bring your bill up to the counter.
- There is a self-serving tea station in the back right corner.
- Uncooked wontons and fish balls are available for sale."}
{"text":"This place has to be one of my favourite places for quick and fast wonton noodles! The noodles are so yummy and delicious! It isn't like the typical normal won ton, this bowl got some zest in it. They also have this really spicy sauce which people put in everything. Fair warning, this stuff is super hot! It's one of the hottest sauces I have tried. Prepare to use alot of napkins ! Just a little will do the trick. They also sell this sauce at their restaurant. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water, that's how good this place is! You can also add more noodles if u want but I find the normal size is good for lunch as it already comes in a fairly descent size."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, fast, and tasty.

Friendly service but simple service as you pay for food and not flourish.

* Self-service tea
* hotter than normal Chili oil, so be aware
* large wontons so enjoyyyyyy"}
{"text":"Been coming here since it opened. Don't come here for the service. Come cause its cheap, fast and filling.  Stick with the shrimp wonton noodle soup."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times before. Prices are good but they are starting to really skimp. I ordered the signature noodle which is a bowl of soup noodles with two wontons, two fish paste and beef. When they first brought the noodles I thought this must be a joke. The beef were these little bits that looked like leftovers. I asked about it as I had ordered this many times before and the amount of beef was never this sparse. Somebody whipped by to look at it and 10 minutes later I was told that's the usual amount. I don think so. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Very authentic Hong Kong style noodle house. No frills and super casual, super fast and delicious. Best shrimp wonton around, same applies on take out, closed on Wednesdays..."}
{"text":"Fantastic tiny little wonton noodle joint.  The wontons however are not tiny!  They are ginormous and juicy!  My husband and I usually get a bowl of wonton noodle soup each and share a plate of veggies for under $15!"}
{"text":"For the price you pay, the quality of food and the fast service. The bowl of noodles with beef and shrimp wonton for about 5 bucks? That's a deal a person can't say no to. You're in and you're out."}
{"text":"Best shrimp wonton and fish balls!!! Hong Kong store was awarded Michelin one star. Must try."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a lot ever since I was a kid. I still love the simple, delicious menu. My favourite dishes are the Gai Lan with oyster sauce and egg noodles with big (and i mean BIG) shrimp dumplings."}
{"text":"A must-go place if you like Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup.  Sister restaurant is Hong Kong is ranked on of the best.

From your second trip and onward, you won't need a menu: 
-- Pick the topping: shrimp wonton or fish balls or beef balls or any of the two or all three 

-- Pick the noodles: skinny chewie Cantonese type, or rice noodles, if you don't like soupy noodles, order Lo Mein so you get broth on the side 

You can get the topping without the noodles, too. I usually get a bowl of shrimp wontons in broth. Be warned, each wonton is the size of a baby's fist, and you get 6 in one order! 

Super fast and efficient service (tea is self-serving), no ambiance but that's not what you should be going there for. 

Cash Only"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time but it seems that they've lost their touch. I recently went to another wonton restaurant and I must say that they surpass this restaurant by miles. All of the staff seem new and it seems like ownership changed as well. I hope they can bring back what use to make them so amazing."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cheap, fast, and yummy place to have some noodle soup, this is the place to go! I always come here for their wonton noodle soup. The wontons are huge and delicious, each bowl comes with 4 wontons and a very generous portion of noodles. And all for only $5!!!

The restaurant is very spacious, I have never had to wait for a seat when I came. The service is super fast, I've always gotten my orders within 5 minutes of ordering. They have a very simple menu of noodles soup, lo mein or just soup with no noodles. You can choose the type of noodles you want, and either wonton, beef, or fish, or a combination of those. And everything on their menu is under $7!!

If you like spicy food, try adding some of their spicy sauce to the noodle. I love the added flavour! However, be aware that the sauce is very spicy, so don't overdo it!"}
{"text":"This place is still as yummy as I remember every year I'm in Toronto. The owner and staffs are wonderful, as always. The wonton is huge, it's so delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Jim Chai Kee's wonton noodles. This place is the definition of cheap good eats. The wontons are huge, while the egg noodles have good texture. The combo noodles are also delicious (beef, fish balls, and wontons), but I prefer getting all wontons instead."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my grandma and wife....it was a traditional wonton soup location. 

The decor was....meh....when I went to the bathroom, it was dirty. I may have been spoiled and was used to the clean restrooms at other locations. That is why I was so not used to it. It reminded me of Downtown Chinatown shady washrooms probably had things living in it, but thats my opinion. 

The food was pretty good. The soup was warm and good, and the wontons were amazing. Soup was very light, so it wasn't very salty. The one thing that was good was the limited selection on the menu. I like things to be simple, and so this was perfect. Making it even better was the fact that my grandma could never decide. By having a small selection, the ordering time was quick and painless. 

Service was very fast. Felt like it was faster than McDonald's and all the fast food chains. Usually, it means cold food, but this place was fantastic. hot food with speedy delivery. 

Overall, it was ok. Just don't go into the washroom first....it may ruin your appetite. 

Pro

Good food
Fast service
Light soup (not too salty)

Con

Filthy washrooms."}
{"text":"A place to satisfy your wonton noodle cravings. Menu is limited and if you're here, you're here for the wonton noodles. Very casual restaurant that's been around for a long time. Good value - $6 for a bowl of shrimp wonton noodle soup. You get four giant shrimp wontons (1.5 times the size of the soup spoon) with an adequate amount of egg noodles. For $2.50 you can add a small side of Chinese greens. Hot water and tea is self serve at the back of the restaurant. The chilli oil is very good. Hey spicy so don't add so much until you test it out. You can buy a jar of it for $10 at the cash."}
{"text":"Shrimp wontons were definitely as big and full of shrimp as all the reviews promised BUT I had a huge problem with the salt content. I don't know if I'm just used to more mild wontons, but these were unbearably salty. I had to drown each wonton with vinegar before being able to finish it. One of my wontons even had grainy pieces of what I would assume were undissolved salt grains. 

Very filling for $5 but still not the quality wontons I'm searching for."}
{"text":"Best wonton noodle ever and price is reasonable. Place is always packed
Will return this weekend"}
{"text":"Best shrimp wontons I ever had.  Faster than fast service.  Food came in less than 2 minutes.  Awesome place.  Price very affordable."}
{"text":"This is such an awesome place to get simple HK style wonton noodles. They have a very simple and focused menu that tells you they specialize in this stuff and they know what they are doing.

Your menu options are basically 3 choices of toppings (wonton, beef, fish cakes), 2 choices of noodles (egg noodle or rice noodle), and soup or \"dry\" style. The noodle texture is excellent. The beef and fishcakes are so so. Their wontons are the best and it is what I recommend.

It's definitely not a fine dining place but then again, HK style usually means fast, economical, and simple. This place hits all 3. Taste is great too of course. It's a very canton style of food that emphasizes the ingredients rather than rely on condiments for taste. It's quite light but it's exactly what I wanted."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? Fast, simple and delicious! It took me merely seconds before I decided on what I wanted to order. I simply had to choose a topping of my choice along with a type of noodle. Within a few minutes (exactly 2 minutes), I received my bowl of noodles. If you're looking for a quick lunch, this is the place for you! You will be out the door in less than 20 minutes. 

Fishball Noodle in Soup ($5.00):

My meal was a combination of a clear and well-seasoned broth, a generous amount of silky-smooth Chinese rice noodles and 4 chewy and spongy fish balls. I like adding a few drops of the complimentary hot oil to my bowl of noodles before I indulge in it. Do you know that thrilling feeling when you eat hot and spicy food? I'm obsessed with it. 

Moreover, I love the open concept of the kitchen - you can watch the chefs prepare the fishballs and cook your meal right in front of you. This place reminds me of the noodle stalls in Hong Kong -  the restaurant layout, customer service and most importantly the food!"}
{"text":"Best place for wonton noodles...hands down!

Once you walk in, you will be immediately seated. The menu is really small and it's easy to pick an item since the concept is really simple and all comes with wonton. There's self serve tea at the back of the restaurant which is really cool. 

Wonton soup with noodles is probably my favourite because the broth of the soup is so flavourful and delicious. 

There are vinegar, hot sauce and other sauces on the side so you can add whatever sauce you prefer with your soup to add more flavour. 

The Chinese broccoli is also very yummy and fresh! Really goes well with the wonton noodles. 

This place is really good for their fast service and simple menu. You get in, eat and get out within 15 minutes. You go here for the huge shrimp wonton...so delicious. Very simple yet to comforting."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  It never disappoints here.  The soup is always hot, staffs are so friendly, food is excellent and the food arrives within 1-2 minutes of ordering.  You can't get that anywhere else!

I always order the shrimp wontons on its own since I'm not a fan of noodles and side dish of vegetables.  We go here quite often!"}
{"text":"Great food at cheap prices and service was very fast. Wonton and the beef are both excellent"}
{"text":"I crave wonton noodles from time to time.. so today was the day. I ordered the fish paste with wonton. I like this place as I find the broth less greesy and the noodles has a nice texture. There's a few on these wonton noodle places in Toronto, this one doesn't serve the dumplings. The atmosphere feels like you are back in Hong Kong. The Chili oil is made in house and just enough heat. My brother enjoyed it so much that we had to buy a bottle home. The Chili oil is $10 per bottle. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best wonton noodle soup place I've ever been to. The workers were so nice and smiley. It's not often to get such great service. We got the Signature Noodle Soup and Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup and were really enjoyed our meal. 
The Signature Noodle Soup ($8) comes with two shrimp wonton, two fish balls and some slices of beef. The Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup ($6) comes with four shrimp wontons. These bowls don't look big but they're really filling. Once you unravel the noodles, you'll realize that there's so much. The soup is really clear and clean tasting. If you like spicy foods, try their homemade chili oil because it's bomb. The shrimp wontons are huge and the shrimp is whole, not minced. It really makes a huge difference in taste! The fish balls weren't my favourite but they were big and better than most places. The beef slices were so tender and delicious. 
I definitely recommend eating here. The food is great and the price is hard to beat. Make sure to get the wontons!!"}
{"text":"If u come here, u come for one thing only. THE BEST WONTON NOODLE SOUP IN RICHMOND HILL (possibly anywhere). Ive been frequenting this place since i was a child. the pricing has inflated ever, ever so slightly from 20 yrs ago but hey ppl gotta make a living right? every bowl is meticulously made the exact same way with no shortcuts and the wontons simply CANT BE BEAT. they are huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge and made right in front of ur eyes ... p.s. their beef noodle soup is awesome as well but the big must-try is definitely the wonton noodle soup.... tea and water is self-serve btw"}
{"text":"I don't normally eat wonton noodle soup, but today I was craving it and found this location as recommended via yelp.  This location only sells wontons, noodles and soup.

I'm glad I stopped by. I got shrimp wonton with egg noodle soup as a take out order and I was really happy with the taste of such a simple dish.

Shrimp wontons are BIG; has 2 large size shrimps in one wonton. For one order, it came with 4 wontons- essentially I got 8 pieces of shrimp.

Very satisfied and the soup also, as it didn't taste too salty either- so everything was perfect and the egg noodle tasted fresh.

On top of that, the service was great! I spoke English instead of their language and the lady was so nice to me. She even double checked the order and asked me 3 times if I wanted cutlery.  My order was ready in 5 minutes. 

Talk about great take-out service. Haha I wouldn't have expected it longer than that anyways given that all they had to do was box my noodles and wonton in one box then the soup base in another.

Overall, very satisfied and would buy again from here if I'm craving this and want a quick small noodle dish to eat! 

It's also super cheap for dishes!"}
{"text":"Came here for the famous shrimp wontons and was not disappointed.

These are the biggest shrimp wontons I've ever encountered.

For $4.50 (A2), you get 4 golf ball size, fully shrimp-stuffed wontons and a good amount of noodles. It's likely the best deal in town for wonton noodle.

Husband tried the combination bowl that comes with some beef and 2 minced fish and 2 wontons (A1, $6.00). We agreed that beef and fish wasn't anything special and he said he'll stick to wonton next time.

The noodle texture was perfect for me, al dente. The broth was a bit salty IMO.

Service was quick, 2 min to look over the menu before a lady comes to take your order and 1 min for the noodle to arrive.

Though a lot more spacious and cleaner than most wonton noodle places in HK, it's still not a place you would want to linger long after your meal is done. Though the ladies provided adequate service there, their voices were extremely loud and annoying, even to myself who had resided in HK for awhile. They practically screams the orders from the front to the back and kept at that pitch while chit chatting with one another.

Nevertheless, the wontons are still great and I will definitely come back for more.


One more thing, the hot sauce on the table is great but use with caution. It's really STRONG stuff. I can normally handle spice and a few sprinkle was enough for me."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years but with my travels haven't been back in a long time. Mmm... it's like coming home. As usual lots of nice crunchy shrimp in each wanton... excellent value at $6-8 for a bowl of 4 with noodles.  maybe my memory is playing tricks on my but I thought they used to be larger... but still a good size like other good wanton places.  The noodles were a bit on the soft side... I prefer more bite from these sort of noodles.  The soup is very flavorful.  Simple menu...Nice fast service."}
{"text":"Can NEVER go wrong with the shrimp wontons! We also always buy the chili oil to bring back to NYC..."}
{"text":"Still good. Thank you. Broth is delicuous, options are plenty enough for them to be specialuzed in making wonton soup. Yummy"}
{"text":"Closed at 7:38 PM. Incredibly misleading and wasted our time. All they could say was that they were no longer serving. Very arrogant. No notice at all on google or yelp that their last call was whenever they felt like it. Very unprofessional, and I clearly wouldn't recommend this to anyone no matter how reputable they are."}
{"text":"Whenever I am not too hungry and wanted something light and quick to eat, I will come here. Their wonton noodles is amazing and recently priced. The wonton noodle comes with 4 wonton with $5. Their soup base is good as well, I don't feel they put a lot of MSG in there. 

My mom likes to get their frozen wonton and cook it for lunch at home."}
{"text":"Quick and fast! Wontons are great, as well as their chilli oil. You can also take premade wontons home to cook for the next day."}
{"text":"I crave their wonton noodles weekly and I do dine in almost weekly (sometimes more than once a week). 

Very fast service! Very simple menu. CASH ONLY!

I usually order the wonton egg noodles in soup with a side of vegetables (gai lan). 

They make their own chili sauce/oil. It is so good; I eat a tiny spoonful with every bite of my noodles. They sell jars of this chili sauce if you'd like to purchase some.

Red vinegar compliments their shrimp wonton so well. 

10/10. I recommend this restaurant to everyone. 

Closed Wednesdays."}
{"text":"My go to spot for wonton noodles. For $5, you can get a big bowl of wonton noodles or wonton rice noodles. The wontons are huge and the broth is amazing. I would recommend adding some of their signature hot sauce into the broth.

For newcomers, this restaurant is self-serve meaning you grab your own tea and water st the back. Remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"The food:
Hands down, the best wontons I've ever had! I mean, you know it's going to be delicious when it's the only thing they offer on the menu.

The service:
Super friendly staff, and you will get your food in under 5 minutes. Trust me, I've timed it every time I go just to prove to the friends I bring here haha.

Overall, amazing food for an amazing price!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place but lately they've been cheapen out on their promotions and sizes of their wontons and fish balls. This kind of irritates me because Jim Chai Kee is supposed to be a famous place that does have a lot of regulars eating there. By doing this, it does not only show how cheap the owner is but how much they don't appreciate their clients (especially the regulars)."}
{"text":"this place is FAST, Delicious and good price! what more can you ask for? the noodles are cooked just right, not overcooked and the wontons are huge and delicious! my fav is the homemade giant fish balls! they are even bigger than the wontons and delicious. I like the few choices, so people orders quickly, but ALL choices are great. Get a side dish of the veggies and it's a great meal. the XO sauce they have is delicious also, I wonder if it's homemade also, they sell it by the jar at the cashier counter."}
{"text":"WORTH THE EXTRA DRIVE.   I have heard people come out of the way for a bowl of comfort soup noodles from Jim Chai Kee.  In fact, this simple quick restaurant  is well known among people who don't even live in the GTA.  We have been going there for 7 years now and it is still consistently the best won ton/beef/fish ball noodles around.   They do not skimp on the enormous won tons as they are filled with shrimp and not pork or other fillers.  The steamed Chinese veggies are also tasty and fresh. 

The prices haven't even changed in the last few years. The menu is small and simple and as such, it takes as little as seconds to get your food.  And the owner is always friendly and ready with a pair of scissors to help the kids cut up the noodles if need be."}

I grew up next door to a Wonton Noodle business in Hong Kong.
For some reason, I never actually felt excited compared to other Noodles.
Truth is unlike my Parents, I tend to eat more Instant Ramen than WN.
It's especially true in Canada as Wonton Noodle shops are not walking distance away.
It doesn't help that they all close CRAZY early.

The Food comes HK-style speedy, faster than your perception of Fast-Food.

{"text":"This place certainly has it's fan base and loyal customers. Food is good. Menu is simple. Price is inexpensive. Service is quick once you are seated. The wait times for a table may be long, however, the turnover is frequent. Their operation is called efficiency - get you seated quickly, fill in all chairs when possible (9/10 times you will be sharing a table with strangers and having an awkward meal) and out the door in record time. Such a simple business model. 
But quick service doesn't mean good service. I've dined here many times. I've never expected much, or any at all, in terms of service from a Chinese establishment, especially one where you are in and out of the restaurant in 20min or less. I certainly do not expect the staff to be rude either. Sadly, this happened. Staff Lady A was rude, impatient, aggressive, disrespectful and negative because I did not want to share a table at a time when the restaurant WAS NOT BUSY. 

For a simple, no frills restaurant that does good food, it's easy to win people's heart, and 5 stars on Yelp. However, with people like Lady A working there, it's even easier to lose repeat customers and not even deserving of 1 star."}
{"text":"Tiny menu: choice of 3 toppings with 3 carbs served with soup or soup on side, maybe side Yo Choy; that's basically their entire menu; but everything tastes great

PRO: noodles are awesome, springy on teeth and smooth; fish ball is everything it should be, wanton is smooth, generous, and delicious, soup is delicious all by itself

CON: beef appears to be not choice cut, tenderized with tenderizing mallet and baking soda (or something), but it's delicious and smooth; Yo Choy is a bit chewy (old), I prefer younger vegetables

Don't expect service, get your own water/tea and pay cash at counter"}
{"text":"5 stars for delicious, generous sized wontons! 

I always love dropping by this restaurant when I am craving a big hot bowl of noodles. I always go with the traditional wonton noodles and no wonder this restaurant has had so many wonderful reviews for so long!!!

Their noodles are the right amount of chewy and isn't too soft but the best part is their wontons. They do not hesitate to put generous amounts of ingredients in each one! After having 2-3, I am stuffed! 

You also cannot be more thrilled that your meal is less than $10 per person even if you add extra wontons or extra noodles and get a side dish of leafy greens!"}
{"text":"Delicious wonton noodle soup!!! First time here and will for sure go back. Prices are cheap for richmond hill area. Self serve tea/water station, staff are friendly and efficient. We were in and out within 30mins from ordering and eating. A must try for sure!!"}
{"text":"If you want your wonton noddle fix reminiscent of the ones you'd get in HK, this is the No. 1 place to go to in the GTA. One caveat, you would have to pour your own cup of tea and they limit one styrofoam cup per person. Needless to say this place is not meant for those who value service. 

Both their wonton and fish paste are very good.  If you are sharing with a friend, it's a better deal to get one bowl of wonton and one bowl of fish paste at $5 each, rather than the wonton + fish paste bowl at $6 each."}
{"text":"Delish and cheap. Fast friendly service and quality simple food. Really enjoyed it and appreciated the staff helping with ordering and suggestions."}
{"text":"Super affordable and filling!

For $5, you can get 4 extremely large shrimp wontons with your choice of egg noodle or rice noodle. Your order comes in less than 5 minutes! Their shrimp wontons are 2x bigger than many other places and super yummy as well!

Definitely recommend coming during your lunch break if you live around."}
{"text":"This place is like crack good. It was recommended by family who live in NYC!!! They visited ME in the GTA, and they took me to THIS restaurant. You know it's good, when people from NYC are saying this little place is worth it! Shrimp wontons are where it's at. The noodles are so good, and the Chinese broccoli is delicious too. It is very simple, hearty and DIRT CHEAP. If I lived closer, I'd come here everyday."}
{"text":"Huge wontons and fish balls!!  Fast service with various combination bowls of wontons, fish balls, and tender beef slices with or without noddles. You can pick either egg noodles, rice noodles and vermicelli with no extra charge.

Bonus: if you like chilly sauce, they have one of the hottest sauces that I have tried in a while. So hot that there are disclaimers posted on the wall in Chinese telling you to be aware of the hotness.  You can also buy the sauces in jars."}
{"text":"My favourite wonton place to go! I work in the area so it's a quick, filling, cheap place to go. However I do think they give you more in you dine-in as opposed to take-out. 

I always get the shrimp wonton with egg noodle; the wontons of nice and plump with very little fillers and all shrimp  I do believe that they make their own egg noodle, please don't quote me on that! 

Their house made chilli oil, is sooo spicy for me personally one little pea size drop is good. 

I do like the cozy, kind of in your own house vibe it gives. The tea/water is self pour and you pick your own seats most of the time.

Overall it's hard to find a lunch under ten dollars that's not fast foods in the area. One of my go-to worktime lunches."}
{"text":"Made me feel like I was in H.K. again! Service was super efficient, food came within minutes of ordering. If you are hungry looking for a quick bite this place is perfect. Their wontons are some of the biggest ones I've ever seen. You can't go wrong with ordering the classic wonton noodle soups, you get a choice of either egg noodles or flat rice noodles. 

Be ready to share tables with other customers when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Great food but small portions. Had the shrimp wonton soup. It definitely the dish to get."}
{"text":"Not the biggest fan of these overall but that being said this place is as good as it gets for noodles and the like. Great value and lightning quick service are great foundations for a restaurant.

Let's start off with the $5 shrimp wonton egg noodles. You'll be hard pressed to find that good of a deal anywhere. It comes with three (was I cheated one?) large wontons and the shrimp is nice and tender. I personally liked the fish balls better though. They were also fairly large and tasty. There's a good amount of noodles (and soup) included and should be filling enough for meal.

The dried noodles (lo mein) included a bowl of soup which is awesome. Get the plate of veggies (gai lan) for $2.50 and thank me later. You need your veggies, and they're good for you! :) They're boiled and served with oyster sauce. Compliments the noodle soups very well. 

Overall I found everything a tad too salty but that's just my taste buds. The chili oil is on the spicier side of chili oils so use and eat with caution, because my lips were on fire and made the hot broth even worse. 

When I first stepped in, I certainly did not expect the place to look as it is. Full of tables, walls covered with articles, it just looked very messy. But hey, it was packed and the turnover rate was incredibly fast. You're here for cheap noodles, not for the ambience bit it's worth mentioning it feels like a restaurant in Hong Kong or China. It's an experience!"}
{"text":"The shrimp wontons are huge but a little bland. Regardless it satisfied my soup craving and came out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"The best place for a cheap and delicious bowl of piping hot egg noodle soup with huge shrimp wontons. The menu is short and sweet, just the way I like it! I always get the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce as well for my veggies.. For $2.50 you can't go wrong! 

You can also get a box of 12 uncooked shrimp dumplings for $10, so you can bring it home and make some when you're getting the 2am munchies."}
{"text":"Great cheap eats! If i lived closer i would be there everyday. Flavorful soup, loong lo-mean, huge wonton balls, beef was tender."}
{"text":"I've been to JCK a couple times and it never disappoints. 
The shrimp wontons are excellent, the beef is extremely tender, the noodles are delicious and the broth is pretty much perfect. However, I wasn't the biggest fan of their fishballs. 
The house chilli sauce/oil is excellent, it's the right balance of richness and spice. 
The food comes very quickly and it's very cheap as well. 
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Best wonton noodle soup in N America.  Have to try this place they have great prices and quick service. Delicious noodle soup. We went there with my family and everyone went home happy. No credit card accepted cash only but US dollar is welcome."}
{"text":"Big fat wontons, super hot and super fast service. Great cheap eats, (cash only), and satisfying. There is so much shrimp in the wontons and the chilli oil is so nice and spicy. If you're craving something soupy, savoury, shrimpy, with chewy noodles, this is a great option. Service is friendly and the food is as reflected in other yelper pics. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had not been here for several years.  I came in for a quick lunch, and a chance to update my viewpoint.

The restaurant was half full just after the lunch rush had ended.  I noticed a new menu focussing on the noodle dishes.  I defaulted to my classic choice-Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup.

My lunch arrived within 3 MINUTES, steaming, and delicious.  4 golf ball sized wontons crammed with fresh, crisp shrimp sat on a bed of fresh noodles and broth.  The dish is so fresh, no matter how slow I ate, the noodles would never have turned soggy.

I hate winter, but this soup makes winter bearable.  I can't wait for winter, I'll be spending a lot of lunches here!"}
{"text":"Great relaxed family atmosphere. You walk in order and go get your own tea. They only do a few things, but they do them well. And the gummy hamburger on your way out is the cherry on the cake."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and still loving it.  

It's simple yet delicious and quick, you can be in and out in 10-15 mins.  The wontons are packed with shrimp and the homemade chili sauce is bomb dizzle.  

A must try of you are in the hood."}
{"text":"The ingredients are so fresh and the price is very resonable. I ordered the dry noodles with fish ball and shrimp and it comes with a small bowl of soup on the side. I don't like the oyster sauce because it was too sweet. I expect wonton noodles sauces to be salty instead of sweet. Portion is pretty small , won't fill u up."}
{"text":"Cheap, fabulous value and so not expensive.. definitely great for a quick bite.. too bad they closed so early... Also, after I finished eating their noodles and wontons, I was so thirsty.. There is simply too much MSG in their food I wonder if I can ask next time whether to omit MSG or not :)"}
{"text":"I went with great expectations based upon the glowing reviews here at YELP.  What a letdown. 

A polite way to describe the interior would be to call it shabby.  It is long overdue for a substantial makeover, including new tables and chairs.  The waitress was not what I would call friendly.  I must admit that the food did come quickly but.... it was the chef who delivered it to my table.  

I was not impressed with the flavour of either of the two dishes I ordered.   I asked if they had soda water.  NO....instead I was directed to the back of the restaurant and told to pour myself tap water from the sink.  When asked if I wanted chopsticks or fork, I opted for a fork and to my surprise the waitress brought the cheapest white plastic fork I have ever seen. The whole experience was underwhelming and I could not wait to leave.  The fishballs were bland, the beef was bland and the shrimp balls were nothing to rave about. 

Would I ever go back or recommend this place?  Not a hope in hell."}
{"text":"A bang for your buck! 

Only $5 to treat yourself to a large portion of Hong Kong-style Wonton Noodle Soup, a hefty bowl of thin egg noodles cooked to perfection accompanied by 4-5 large shrimp wontons and garnished with green onions (option to omit). Already a fresh taste on it's own but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it with some red vinegar or hot chili paste.

Make sure you arrive hungry! 

PRO TIPS:
- Bring cash as it's CASH ONLY
- Options to upsize noodle portion or change noodle type (egg noodle, vermicelli, wide rice noodle)
- Option to add veggies (Yu Choy) for $2.50
- Help yourself to some tea in the back of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Everything everyone says is true. Cheap, fast, generous portions. Order once you get in, food comes out in less than 2 minutes, quickly chow down the food and you can be out the door in under 10 minutes.

I always order the wonton noodle soup which comes with at least 4 super size wontons. Don't forget you get a selection of three different noodles too, so watch out for those if you're picky. I always forget and quickly order the standard.

I must not forget to try the beef or fish balls next time, but it's hard to not get the wontons when you walk in.

Go get your own tea at the back, but by the time you get it, the food will be at your table (in many cases)."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this because the HK branch was absolutely delicious but we were underwhelmed"}
{"text":"This was an easy decision. Best wontons and noodles I have ever had. They put the rest to shame. If I could eat more, I'd order doubles of both noodles and wontons. THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"basically fast wonton noodle. Cheap and quick service. I swear we ordered our food and within 2 minutes, we had a steaming bowl of wonton noodle soup.

Taste-wise it wasn't the best, but it was pretty filling and worth the price. I'd come here for quick work lunch or a snack. 

Broth's alright, I'd prefer a stronger meatier taste, but it's wonton.

Get their signature noodle bowl."}
{"text":"Tasty broth and delicious and large shrimp dumplings. The beef is juicy, succulent and soft. The Chinese broccoli and oyster sauce is a great side. You can't beat the prices and service is exceptionally fast. Their homemade chilli oil is the bomb which you can buy at the front cash when paying. Only thing I would complain is the soup comes out piping hot but seems to lose a lot of its temperature quickly while you're eating."}
{"text":"15 Word Summary:  An order of cheap wonton noodles served so fast you wonder where it came from!

Important Notes: CASH ONLY!

This place is pretty much a completely ad-hoc restaurant. You walk in, no menu is served, it's on a plastic stand on a table with limited choice (Wonton, Fish ball or beef noodle soup or non-soup), vegetables with oyster sauce and that's pretty much it. Also nothing is actually served except the food, so you gotta get up from your lazy ass and serve yourself some tea (meh I guess I can do that but it makes me pretty reluctant in providing any tip!).

Now one thing about this place that it's known for and that is it's INSANE SPEED!! You can be in and out of this place in less than 10 minutes flat if you're in a rush! My friends and co-workers had constantly told me about the ridiculous speeds at which they serve their food here so I decided to actually time it to see if they were bullshitting me or not. KID YOU NOT, we ordered 2 wonton noodle soups and a plate of chinese vegetables with oyster sauce. The timing is as follows:

30 SECONDS AFTER ORDER: Vegatables Served!!!!

25 SECONDS AFTER VEGETABLES: Both wonton noodles soups Served!! 

Yes you read that right, nearly A MINUTE after walking into the restaurant we were already served our food! Now this brings up the question of what the hell are they serving us but it actually was pretty decent. The food is a bit bland but the shrimp wontons are pretty big and for $4.50 I cannot complain one bit!"}
{"text":"Wonton noodle soup is what people come here for, and it's great! 

Satisfying portions, delicious taste, and good value is what keeps me coming back to Jim  Chai Kee.

Try paying a little extra to get the wonton lo mein (noodles with no soup) version, which also comes with some oyster sauce on top. A nice alternative to the the noodle soup!

The restaurant is clean and has friendly staff, especially the guy who collects money at the cash register. What a friendly guy! However, there are better places to bring a first date.

There is free parking in the outdoor plaza but it could be challenging to find a spot during peak eating times (lunch, dinner)

You can get some free hot tea in the back yourself."}
{"text":"Everything is quick here, very Hong Kong style and be prepared to sit with strangers. Don't expect \"service\" but the wonton noodle soup is definitely one of the best in GTA."}
{"text":"The place is small but will suffice for a quick lunch. We ordered the wonton noodles mixed with fish ball, and they were both good. The wontons were filled with shrimps and the fish balls were size of a spoon, good portions. 
Tip: Sit closer to the back of the restaurant on a hot day to get better air conditioning."}
{"text":"Yelp was spot on with this one. Small, simple place with fast and friendly service and cheap, delicious food. 

Shrimp wonton soup is the way to go. The wontons are huge, succulent, and have plenty of shrimp meat. The noodles and broth weren't the best quality, but you come for the wontons. Next time I'll probably hold the noodles and hope they just give me a bowl full of wontons.

It's a great place to grab a quick and satisfying bite. Not \"roll-me-out-the-door\" portions but filling enough.

One of the better places on my ongoing Toronto/Markham foodie adventure.

Note: As with every Asian-y plaza, parking is a bitch. Especially at peak lunch times. You've been warned."}
{"text":"My friends mentioned this is the best place in Richmond Hill to get wonton noodle soup and DAYAMMMM it really is.  Great place to get wonton noodle when you are craving something warm as well as the wontons give a healthy serving of shrimp unlike other wonton places where you barely see any shrimp or ingredients at all except for the wrapper.  A great place to eat as well as the veggie dish is really cheap, only $2.5 to add on as opposed to other restaurants charging you a grand total of 10 dollars like a normal dish because it has the word veggie in it's name. 

Quite a bit of seating space as well as they have a self serve tea/hot water in the back that you have easy and simple access to allowing for greater enjoyment of the soup noodle itself.  I do suggest the original which comes with everything including their beautiful wontons as it is pretty good value for the amount of food that it comes with it.  Their service was fast as well as we were welcomed as soon as we came in and hence, what more can you ask for from a place that  satisfies your taste on a consistent basis.  

A hidden gem within the local richmond hill/markham community."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food - because it's great for its price point. A truly authentic experience, as recommended by my Cantonese friends. The brusque/slightly-yelling service, limited menu options, and bare decor = feels exactly like Asia. Service is fast but you need to make an effort, this is not a fine dining experience where they'll wait on you. 

Come here only for the wonton noodles, I'd recommend them with shrimp dumplings."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick fast lunch, this is the place to go to.

There is pretty much not a long wait time as their turn over rate is consider fast. Everything on the menu is basically heated and ready to scoop out into your bowl as soon as you order it. 

Menu choices are pretty much very limited so you don't have to spend too much time deciding. Either wet or dry noodles, with wonton, fishball or sliced beef, or you can get all 3 in a bowl too. If you don't want noodles, you can order these on the side.

Prices are $6-$8 depending what you get and what toppings. If you want anything to drink, it's self serve hot tea or hot water. There is basically no service besides the servers taking your order and bringing your food. Food is considered decent, not a huge portion but enough to fill you for lunch. 

When you are ready to pay, you just take your bill to the cashier and pay. They only accept cash and purposely hint you to tip because most people don't feel that there was any service because I certainly didn't."}
{"text":"This is as about Hong Kong as it gets here except for the unusually polite staff (which you definitely will NOT find in HK).

This is my go-to place for simple but delicious soup noodles. There's no abundance of options here, no fancy stuff but just plain deliciousness with your favourite dumplings (only 2 options; sorry nothing for vegetarians), meat (beef only), fish (sorta but not really.. more like fish paste) and veggies (Yu choy only LMAO).

The soup is so hot it burns you, so salty that it's addictive, so simple that you can dine and dash in less than 10 minutes (with a few burns). The chili oil is stupid spicy but so darn addictive. All in all, you will be out the door in under 15 minutes with a few dollars to spare and a full stomach. Soup noodles don't get much better than this anywhere in the city."}
{"text":"Best wonton noodles! Big wontons and excellent hot chili oil!! My favourite is their wonton rice noodles. If I could, I would go once a week. Service is really quick. Once you sit down, you'll get your food a few minutes later. Should make sure you bring cash and it is a self-serve restaurant meaning you will need to get our own tea and go up to pay for your food."}
{"text":"This is the cutest, most cozy family-owned restaurant that I've ever been to and I absolutely love everything about it.

The menu is very minimal, but it's a positive detail to note because they are very specialized in wonton soups, so you know that they are going to taste great. This restaurant is cash only, so make sure you have some before you walk in.

I ordered the wonton and beef with the soup on the side, while my friend ordered the signature noodle with the soup in the dish. Mine came with a vegetable stalk and some hoisin sauce to compliment the noodles. This dish is so simple, but it's so heart-warming and I could easily go for a second bowl right after! The wontons are really big and they give an abundant amount for the small price. At only $5-7 dollars per dish, I can understand why this establishment is highly popular. Very fast service, very friendly owners as well.

Overall, great place to eat and I always come back for more! My favorite restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This place is good for wontons and noodles if you're in the area and got a real hankering for the dish. I would probably drive out a bit east for better though...

The noodles are decent and broth isn't overly salty, which I appreciated. The wontons were pretty good and very filled so I like seeing that in my bowl. Great value, and a really inexpensive meal. mind you, some people may have to get two bowls haha!

I would really not recommend getting the beef though. People are saying it's so soft and melts in your mouth.. but it's really not natural for beef to be so... soft and breakable. This wasn't a beautiful type of melt in your mouth freshness, but rather I tasted the freeze burned beef that was marinated in something very strong for too long that broke the protein down into an unnatural sort of mushy feeling.. I didn't like that at all as a texture person. So I would stick with the wontons. 

Try the chilli oil by the way :) Not bad!"}
{"text":"Lo Mein, is one..... MEAN DISH. 
HYUK HYUK. 

I genuinely have not had better Lo Mein in Canada than at Jim Chai Kee. 

Could be the MSG, could be lard, but one thing for certain...it is love. 

Wontons and the soup could be better. Shrimp lovers, take your fill. The shrimp is cooked well and not overcooked or rubbery in my opinion. A good snap each bite and a good amount of seasoning with the pork. 

I prefer smaller wontons that are saltier and with pork. 

The chilli is great and the oyster sauce is on point. 
All this dude needs to come back here time and time again."}
{"text":"Classic HK fast food style for wonton noodles. You get in, sit down, they ask for your order within minutes and then BAM, your food is in your face. Great place for a quick and cheap meal. Don't be afraid to share tables either. I love their wontons but not a fan of their beef, I'm more of a brisket kinda guy. Oh, and tea or hot water is self serve. Efficiency is key here so don't be surprised if service isn't priority."}
{"text":"Had a craving for wonton soup noodles and something quick. Super spacious, around 60 seats, staff is friendly, food is quick! 
We ordered their Signature noodles (beef, wonton,  and fish ball) and yu choy side dish. 

 The wonton are HUGE and the shrimps inside each wonton were crisp, fresh and taste AMAZING whether you like it the way it is or with their homemade chili oil! The beef is super tender. I wasn't a fan of the fishball because it tasted like they just made it from store bought fishpaste and I found the fishy taste too strong. Maybe a bit more white pepper in the fishpaste would have lessened that fishy taste?

From ordering to eating, we only waited several minutes.  

Menu is small, but if you have a wonton soup noodle craving or need to eat quickly, you gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Simple & delicious.  This restaurant for tea and water service is self serve.  The wontons are the most popular items on the menu.  It's light, so when u need a break from all the greasy foods this will be your go to place.  Cheap, affordable,  and reasonable portions."}
{"text":"Jim Chai Kee hands down has the best wonton noodle in the GTA area. If you love noodles in soup (like Ramen or Pho) and shrimp (wonton), you have got to give this place a try. 

Food 5/5 - I had the rice noodles and they were similar to pho noodles but a bit thicker. They were also narrower than the noodles at other wonton places such as Wonton Chai. Nevertheless it still had amazing texture and tasted great. Their shrimp wontons were very delicious, again similar to Wonton Chai's but maybe a little bit smaller. The soup base was better than anywhere I've ever had and really takes their wonton game to another level. Their chili oil was also good.

Service 5/5 - Same service you would get at any other wonton shop, within a minute of ordering I got my bowl of noodles, downed it and paid at the front.

Price 5/5 - A bowl of wonton noodles is only $6 + tax, which is very cheap. In fact I think it is cheaper than almost all other places of similar quality. The price is definitely another factor that makes it a must try as there is so little to lose."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Shrimp Wonton Egg noodle! Great food quality! Shrimp balls are little too salty but still very good. But I dont like the fact that sometimes we should share table with others that I do not even know!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Although not of Asian decent, I do appreciate an amazing serving of noodles and accompaniments. 

The menu is simple. It's consists of bowls of noodles in broth mixed with shrimp dumplings, beef slices, fish cakes and veggies - with your choice of 3 different types of noodles or the same dishes served as plates - no broth. The simplicity of this place is genius. 

I recently went twice - in less than 24 hours. 

First visit - Saturday evening around 7pm. Kitchen closes at 7:30 but they stay open until 8 selling frozen goods in the last half hour. We sat down in less than 15 seconds. As a first timer - it took me a minute or two to learn the menu. Once conquered - ordered the soup with the shrimp dumplings, beef and veggie (substitute). 

Brother was great - simple yet complex. Dumplings were full, well cooked and salted to perfection. The broth is not salty and this helped balance everything out. The beef was cooked, sliced thinly and delicious. The snow pea leaves were perfectly cooked - crunchy and delicious. 

Second visit: went with 3 friends. Twice as busy as the previous evening but still got a table in less than a minute. Was offered forks upon arrival but obviously declined for the standard chopsticks. 

All friends were super happy. Happy as - I'll let you fill in the blanks. Total bill 4 people - $26. Do the math. 

This place is a gem. Will continue to go back. If you ever have any sinister plans of replicating the broth at home - good luck. I asked the owner of the restaurant for the recipe but she said it was 3 generations old and top secret. I can see why. 

The bowls are cheap. Like really cheap. They range in price from $3 (veggie) to $7 (trifecta of toppings). 

Service was super fast, friendly and amazing. They have a self serve tea and water station."}
{"text":"old reliable noodle place, soup comes out piping hot always i work close by and always grab take out, even by the time i walk back to work and eat, the soup is still too hot to eat! love the classic wonton lo mien and greens with oyster sauce, delish"}
{"text":"Great cheap eats and food comes out quick! Wontons are full of shrimp and big!"}
{"text":"Good food places, that's what I love about Richmond Hill. Jim Chai Kee is a hidden gem of a wonton. This is the type of establishment that patrons frequent solely for the food alone. Don't expect anything fancy. The service is straightforward, simple menu with just a few items. It's self service for water and tea. In less than 5 minutes after orders are taken, the piping hot shrimp wonton soup with egg noodles arrive on your table. The broth was very flavorful and came with 4 huge shrimp wontons. I eat mine with chili oil and red vinegar and finished it in record time. I will definitely be back. For $4.50 a bowl of shrimp wonton goodness, you cannot go wrong. They definitely know their business and I don't mind being a repeat customer, or a regular :)"}
{"text":"Cheap, Simple, Fast, Delicious, Huge Freakin' Shrimp Wontons!

The EAT LIST:

Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup ($6):
Skip everything else and just get the Shrimp Wonton. Trust me. I took apart the shrimp wontons and each had 3-4 whole large shrimp! I've eaten at the top Hong Kong Wonton shops in Hong Kong and no one gave more than one large shrimp. It was just so good and fast.  As soon as the waitress took our order and left, our order just magically appeared on our table! 

TIPS:
Menu is small , but don't bother looking. Just get the Shrimp Wonton. 'Nuff said !

Located in s strip mall. Plenty of parking. Near the 404.

CONCLUSION:
Delicious , Fast , Filling, and dirt cheap. Some of the best Wonton Noodle soup I've ever had and that includes Hong Kong."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid and I will NEVER get sick of eating here.
This place honestly has the best wonton noodles for its price. The portions are pretty decent but if you're a big eater or feeling extra hungry you can just add extra noodles. Between my boyfriend and I, we get 2 noodles, a plate of veggies and an ice tea and its around $20. Theres not a lot of places in the area that you could fill up 2 ppl at that price."}
{"text":"One of the best shrimp wonton in Toronto/GTA!
Both noodles and broth were authentic, fish ball was nicely done as well. Only disappointment was the beef, I wish they've braised beef brisket and tendon instead.

Overall, great place to save money on lunch or to get a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"We call this place \"Man Hands\", it's from the show Seinfeld.  the reason is....the person making the shrimp Wontons must have BIG HANDS because they are really big!
I think it's actually a woman making them, so we say she's got \"Man Hands\".
The menu is simple....just a few things.  But what they lack in variety, the make up for in speed, taste, and value.
It is really cheap....$4.50 for wontons with noodles, and for another $2 bucks (I think), they double up the noodles.  You can get just plain Wontons and you'll get 6 of them, else you get 4 with the noodles.

Getting take-out is easy...you walk in, and the kitchen staff from the back asks you what you're ordering, and gets the order prepared as you pay with the guy in the front.  Within 3 minutes of paying, literally, they are bagging up your meal.
For a quick take-out place, it rivals McD's in terms of quickness, but so much more healthy for you."}
{"text":"Jim Chai Kee wonton soup noodle is the pinnacle of wonton soup noodle in Ontario.  

You can take out 1 dozen of uncooked wontons for $9, no tax.  Perfect for camping or over night ski trips (now imagine having golf ball sized wontons with noodle as brunch in your camp site - heaven)."}
{"text":"This is a definitely our go to place for our shrimp wonton fix or a quick meal. Simple menu with shrimp wonton, beef, or fishball soup noodle or lo mein. I usually just get their shrimp wonton alone in the their tasty broth and add some chili oil and vinegar. Simply delicious! Also you can buy the wonton frozen to make at home along with their chili oil."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and incredibly fast.   We received our complete order in less than 3minutes.  The first plate arrive in 30 seconds.  The wonton is hands down one of the best around.
Usually restaurants are faced with the trillema of being fast, cheap, or delicious - where you can only be 2 of 3.  Here you can experience all three qualities."}
{"text":"Cheap and quick eats, great for a snack or fast meal. Wish I worked near here so I could get it for lunch. The wontons are huge and stuffed with shrimp. Beef was okay, fish is made in house and all are available for purchase frozen to take home. Chili oil packs a punch."}
{"text":"If you're craving for Won Ton noodle soup in Richmond Hill then this is the place. It's the best in the area and have been in business serving the same basic menu for 25+yrs. I wouldn't say it's the best ever but definitely very good.

The ambience is basic dine-in Chinese diner restaurant offering a basic menu of noodle soup (with won ton, beef, or fish paste). The won ton is their specialty, the broth is very good, and the noodle is satisfactory. The service is very quick (order taking and cooking) as it's an \"eat quickly  & go\" type of business. Turnaround is quick with customers continuously coming in at all times. In addition, it's cheap! So if you're in the mood for a quick fixin' of tasty won ton noodle soup then you got to try this place.

Note Chinese tea/hot water is free but it's self-serve, the waitresses will direct you to the back."}
{"text":"Small menu, but the ones on the menu are REALLY good.  Make sure you try the wonton noodle.  Selfserve water/tea.  Cheap and quick."}
{"text":"Jim Chai Kee is another local gem in the Richmond Hill area for \"cheap and good eats\". Its been around for quite some time, and is very unassuming as its nestled in Jubliee Square. You can find Jubilee Square just west of Times square, or Leslie and Hwy 7. From Hwy 7 look for the plaza with Shinta and the big CIBC sign.

Jim Chai Kee is unpretentious and sticks to a simple formula of making basically a 3 topping variation of noodle soup. The 3 main toppings are beef (in my opinion not so great), fish balls (also an acquired taste) and the star of the show is their won tons (this is a must try if you come here). 

Their won tons are jam packed full of shrimp, and I will be the first to admit that I have a big mouth, and even I have a very tough time getting a whole won ton into my mouth in one bite (yes I tried it once, and I learned my lesson to not do it)! 

When you first walk in, they have a large number of tables strewn all about, they will ask how many are in your party and you basically grab a seat. If you go during their lunch rush hour, you may or may not get seated where ever there is space - meaning you will be sharing a table with some strangers. 

Their menu is again, very simple and straight forward. You choose any combination of the toppings (won ton, beef or fish balls), then you choose if you want noodle soup, noodles with the soup broth on the side (lo mein) or if you want just the toppings themselves.

Usually when I go with my other half, I go for the classic won ton noodles which comes with 4 won tons, and a bed of egg noodles. My other half gets just the won tons (jing won ton), which comes with 6 won tons and is plenty enough. 

You self serve yourself either tea or hot water (its in the far right corner), and if you like you can get a dish of yu choy (similar to chinese brocolli) for about $2.50.

Please note though that this place is a no frills but good eats style place. So dont expect the best service. In fact, when your server comes to take your order be ready to have them yell out your order for the whole restaurant to hear! But the food comes out fast, hot and furious (under 3 minutes even in rush hour!) 

Again, there is lots of yelling all the time! So dont worry, no one is arguing or fighting. Its just their normal way of talking

So for a bowl of won ton noodles, just won tons and a side plate of yu choy the total bill comes out to $17.50 flat.

I cant think of anywhere else that is as consistently tasty, and affordable for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was young! Nothing but great things to say. Fantastic place if you love wontons! The shrimp wontons are house made you can taste it when you bite into it that it is so fresh! 

Love that I can get wonton soup with either or all of fish balls, beef and shrimp wontons! I personally love it without the soup and I mix the dry noodles with the oyster sauce. Food here doesn't hurt the pocket! 

Recommend getting a plate of veggies on the side with oyster sauce if your a big veggie fan. Tea/hot water are self serve which is cool."}
{"text":"The specialty is wonton's here and that's basically all they do.  If you are expecting a variety of foods to order with your wonton's this isn't the place.  

 Wonton noodle soup and a plate of veggies for the weeeeenn!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a five, but the decor is non-existent. Service is fast and staff are super friendly, but it's a lot of serve yourself (get your own tea and go up to the front to pay). 

Classic wonton noodle soup place. Wontons are delicious and quite large. Soup is super hot and noodles are real, and fresh egg noodles. Plate of veggies is small, but exactly like every other Chinese restaurant with the oyster sauce. 

They have their own special chilli sauce that they sell at the front, so I had to try it. It's super flavourful and got a strong kick at the end (if you can't do spicy, it may not be for you). 

Quick in and out kind of place. Will definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"Pure shrimp won tons the size of golf balls! Awesome shrimp won tons!

Opened in 1996, this hole-in-the-wall Hong Kong style, Chinese restaurant is known for their giant shrimp won tons.  They have a limited menu:

- Choice of two dishes:  noodles in soup or noodles on a plate with oyster sauce and soup on the side (lo mein).

- Choice of three toppings:  shrimp won tons, fish balls, or sliced beef.

- Choice of three noodles:  egg noodles, rice noodles, or vermicelli.

- One side dish:  sautéed Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.

We chose the shrimp won ton with egg noodles in soup ($4.50) and shrimp won ton soup without noodles ($5.00).  They were just heavenly! The won tons were filled with only huge shrimps (no pork fillers); there were four of them with the noodles, and six of them without the noodles.  We have never seen such humongous won tons before, and eating won tons filled only with whole shrimps were just delicious! The thin Hong Kong style egg noodles were chewy and just as good.  The soup was very flavorful and tasty. Each table also had the restaurant's house-made chili oil, which also was very delicious and gave the dishes a spicy kick. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jim-chai-kee-richmond-hill?select=e_d3Q1aqNCxz22Kk3jJAwg  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jim-chai-kee-richmond-hill?select=DyLuJZDa8LxT6lEwBK-rMA 

Service is of lightening speed here. As soon as we ordered, our dishes came within two minutes! I guess with a limited menu, the food items are constantly being prepared. Hot tea and water are self-serve at the back of the restaurant. Once you're done eating, just go up to the host and pay. Great if you're in a rush.

The owner of the restaurant is also the host who will direct you to a table (restaurant has about 40 seats). He's so personable, friendly, and speaks both Chinese and English, which made it easier to communicate. We had three of our four grandchildren with us, and he enjoyed talking to them and gave each of them Scooby Doo packaged fruit chews. I chatted with him for a brief moment, and I could tell that he enjoyed his role as host and had much pride in his restaurant's offerings.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jim-chai-kee-richmond-hill?select=NmfMpwzmFqE-1qQgVrzHTg 

The restaurant is located in Jubilee Square just off of Highway 7 and Leslie St. in Richmond Hill; this shopping complex consists of mainly Chinese businesses - restaurants, bakery, hair stylist, herbal shop, etc.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jim-chai-kee-richmond-hill?select=Q2F6X6OwaVP3BZXt-OJJqg  Jim Chai Kee is very busy during the lunch hour with nearby office workers and Chinese nationals. As a result, the parking lot is always full. They're open daily (closed on Wednesdays) from 10am to 8pm. Cash only. (Richmond Hill is considered one of several \"Chinatowns\" in Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area where many ethnic Chinese residents live.)

You can also buy uncooked won tons and noodles to take home to cook on your own. Jars of their home-made chili oil can also be purchased."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when i go to this place.  Simple food done right.  Extremely affordable.  Very straightforward small menu. The shrimp wontons are huge!  The broth to the soup is flavourful.  The lo mein is so tasty.  The vegetables are always done right.  They serve you the food you ordered instantly.  There isnt much service to rate the service though as you are immediately directed to go to the back to get your own tea in styrofoam cups after you place your order.  Doesnt really bother me though because the food is great!"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place. I mean, literally, I was in and out in 15 minutes!

I was quickly seated, given the menu, and they came back to ask for my order in exactly 47 seconds. Yes, I counted. I ordered the signature noodle. The waitress didn't write down my order, she yelled to the kitchen my order! I guess it saves paper, so all the better.

I went to grab some hot water by myself (self-serve), and when I came back my food was already coming out. Fast! For $6, the portions were definitely generous, and the wontons were so big and juicy! The beef was pretty standard, and the fish balls are unique in the fact it's not your typical ones from T&T, but definitely homemade, large...and not exactly round! I completed my food in about 12 minutes, and was out the door 2 minutes after. Efficiency at its finest!

If you want some quick noodles, this is your place. If you want a place to sit down...this is not your place."}
{"text":"The best shrimp dumplings in Toronto, probably North America, perhaps the world. Been coming here for years, always happy to come back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the wonton soup 

Broth was great 

Serving size is perfect

My boyfriend loved the shrimp wontons they were nice and big and he even ordered an extra soup for take out."}
{"text":"Large wontons and noodles served so quick you'd think they'd predicted your patronage. 

I usually dine here when I want a meal faster than macdonalds. What comes to my table is exactly what I'd expect. The wontons are inconsistent. Sometimes firm and delicious, other times soggy and limp. It's a roll of the dice with the wontons. No comment on the noodles, nothing notable. 

Only come during pre lunch or post lunch. The plaza does not allow for a quick in and out. 

3/5 would quick wonton again."}
{"text":"Love these kind of restaurants. No frills classic hk wonton noodle soup are great price. Really hits the spot. Help yourself to tea. Cash only."}
{"text":"Super fast service with amazing results. 

Sat down and ordered two bowls of wonton noodles and a side of their green veggies w/ oyster sauce. The wonton noodles arrived about a minute later, with the veggie plate coming a minute after that. 

Great food for a great price."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since I was in high school.  Oh about 21 years ago!  Still the same facade inside and out.  It's nice to know that nothing has changed after all these years.
Hands down some of the best shrimp wontons in town.  If you're on a budget this place takes care of that with some of the lowest price food items of many similar places in the area.

In a rush?  They bring the bowls out as fast as you can say can I get extra napkins?  There is hot water and hot tea at the back counter which you can help yourself to at any time.  One cup limit per guest.  Staff have always been friendly and helpful when you ask them a question.  Looking forward to trying their other food offerings other than the wonton soup with noodle bowls that I always tend to lean towards everytime I come here.

It can get busy at times so my suggestion is to try to arrive just before noon as the nearby office workers are rushing to beat the crowds.  Seating for less than 50 people so it can fill up quick come lunch time.  Note they are always closed on Wednesdays for whatever reason.

Overall a great cheap place to enjoy some Chinese home made cusine!"}
{"text":"How I have not wrote a review for this place is beyond me.  If it's a wonton noodle you're craving, Jim Chai Kee (JCK for the rest of this review) is the place to go.

Pros:
Hand made won tons are some of the best in town
Prices are more than fair
Food comes out lightning quick

Cons:
Maybe the broth has slipped?

JCK specializes in one thing and it's the one thing they focus everything on: won ton noodle soup.  If you don't like won ton noodle soup you have no reason to come here.  That being said, if it's won ton noodle soup you're craving, there's no better place in town.  

If you come in early enough, you can see the staff at the end table making fresh won tons every morning.  It's something of a treat to watch them alone.  They skillfully make them as if they're robotic in a way.  The won tons here are the star of the show.  Hand made, and full of shrimp.  There's no trace of fillers whatsoever!!  You can buy these separately to go to cook at home as well.  The kitchen is an open kitchen.  You see your noodle being made right before your eyes.  They have nothing to hide.  

For the amount of shrimp in the won tons, the prices are more than fair in my opinion.  2 people can easily eat here for under $20, tax and tip included.  There is self serve tea here that's basically free of charge if you order anything to eat.  This place is so efficient that your orders come out lightning quick.  You order, and within 3 minutes, it's ready.  You can be in and out easily in 20 minutes.  Need a quick, satisfying and cheap meal?  Look no further than JCK.

I've been coming here for years and sometimes my friends and I notice that the broth may have slipped a little.  It's not negligible at all really.  This place is still my go to place for won ton noodle by far.  

There you have it, as the description for 5 stars here says, JCK is as good as it gets for won ton noodle.  I am and will continue to be a regular here."}
{"text":"The fast service and always consistent quality is why I keep coming back. 

Shrimp wontons are great and the yu choy is a great compliment."}
{"text":"Great classic noodles with wonton. It's so cheap here for a yummy traditional bowl of noodles. The wontons and the broth is so good. Service is extremely fast too. Would recommend coming for a quick bite if you want something tasty, filling, and cheap."}
{"text":"Try the wontons and fish paste, they are delicious! Noodles are done well and the broth is very light- balances out the wontons (on the salty side)

Not much msg (if at all) no dry mouth after eating.

Probably one of the top wonton noodle spots in Richmond Hill/ Markham."}
{"text":"I come to Jim Chai Kee whenever I am looking for a quick and cheap dinner!

This place does not sell their service, you simply sit down, order, self-serve tea/hot water.. and in under a minute you are served a fresh bowl of wonton noodles!

I love the red vinegar and hot chili oil provided, I believe you can purchase jars of the chili oil by itself.

Though this place is closed on Wednesdays and early on all other days (I believe close at 8PM, last call is at 7:30PM), the wonton, noodles and broth are amazing. I have seen this place increase their prices steadily over the years -- around $5 for a bowl these days, but still the best wonton noodles in the area!"}
{"text":"went here alot this review reflects on the one time i found a metal sponge cleaner i found inside my won ton, but the owner responded well but taking the order off and askin if i would like another one free of charge

3/5 stars the won tons are great but cant imagine what would have happened if i ate that metal sponge."}
{"text":"We picked up some take-out here for a snack - shrimp dumpling noodle soup.  Four HUGE dumplings - stuffed with fresh good sized shrimp pieces - per order.  Yum.

Place closes early though, so if you're wanting dinner, please note that they close at 8pm."}
{"text":"Jim Chai Kee has been a main stay forever in Richmond Hill.  Nothing fancy, nothing pretentious, just good value noodles quick and simple.  They've opened other locations either directly or indirectly that are run by family members or former workers but this is the original location and it hasn't changed much after all these years and is still the best.

It's been a while since I've been here so when I saw some posts about Jim Chai Kee, decided to get myself some noodles.  Things haven't changed.  You walk into a simple cheap looking restaurant with pictures and posts around the walls, they ask how many people, you grab a seat, order, eat and pay up front... that's it.  As simple as it gets.

I usually like variety with my noodles so I get the 3 combo noodle with 2 wontons, 2 fish ball patties, and some sliced beef over egg noodles.... I LOVE EGG NOODLES!!!  Noodles comes out in minutes.

Wontons are big and juicy, fish patties are homemade and sliced beef very tender.  Noodles are done perfectly, slightly chewy and the broth is old fashion wonton broth flavoured.  The chili oil is nice and spicy so make sure you put a dollop of it in your noodles if you are chili head like me:)  All for $7.00 plus tax!  Once you've finished, take your order form and pay at front.

If you are looking for high end service, pretentious attitude, look elsewhere.  Looking for no frills value and good HK style noodles?  Welcome home!"}
{"text":"I would recommend his place for wonton noodles only. $5 for a bowl of wonton noodles is an awesome deal!! The wontons are pretty good - I wouldn't say it's my favourite, but definitely worth more then $5!'

The noodles are Al Dante and an extra portion is $2.  The Lo Mein style for $7 an order is not as good a deal compRed to the regular Soup noodles.

The fish balls and beef strips don't taste nearly good as their wontons in comparison... 

Legit fast, good quality, and affordable wonton noodle house! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Jim Chai Kee features blazing fast service in an environment that's the complete opposite of fancy.
The menu is tiny and simple: beef, shrimp wonton or fish ball or two or all three of those in soup, in soup with choice of noodles, or on choice of noodles. Side of vegetables, pop, extra sauce. That's it.
And because the menu is so incredibly simple, the order arrives within mere seconds of placing it. You read that right.
My dining buddy went to visit the washroom (which he said was adequate) right after placing the order, and I was well into my bowl before he returned.

The soup does have the ability to grow on you- it may taste watery at first, but the subtle flavour does manage to come through. The wontons and fish balls are massive and frankly not bad, meeting the expectations one can have given how gourmet the place appears. This is definitely the authentic experience.

The walls of the place are lined with large copies of the menu, printed signs indicating that tea and water are available self-serve at the back, and articles reviewing the restaurant, including one that suggested that a bowl of soup for lunch isn't exactly filling, and with how inexpensive the meal is (we paid $13 for the two of us, including tax and tip) that one could venture to any of the other restaurants in the area to fill up on other food. I'd say just have another bowl if you're desperate.

Another (or was it the same?) review suggested that if a diner indicated they're in a rush, they could be in and out in under 5 minutes- which seemed entirely possible. I think we were in and out in about 20 minutes, and we took our good time.

Nice, inexpensive place to visit for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"People say there's no such thing as a free lunch, but there IS definitely such thing as a $5 lunch!  Ok...plus negligible taxes/small tip if dining in.

I was meaning to go to the newer JCK, but I put this older location in my GPS instead which was not a problem.  They should be the same, but the atmosphere is like an HK fast diner.  Bustling, yet quite service, where it's self serve tea.

What I like is that I wasn't overwhelmed by the menu.  There are only a few options that Jim Chai Kee does, but they do 'em WELL!  Wonton + Fish \"Balls\" (not exactly a ball, but they shape 'em fresh with some sort of spoon) + some kinda beef option with egg OR rice noodles and with/out soup.  Average dishes are like $5, no word of a lie!

Great place if you are feeling like wonton noodles and don't want to spend a whole lot!

(We don't have this place in Mississauga, but it's just slightly better than Wonton Chai Noodle House.  JCK noodles are slightly thicker, but still chewy.  Fish balls are def better here!)"}
{"text":"I come here every couple of months for dine-in or take out. I usually get the lo mein and wontons (shrimp), which is super yummy. Today I mixed it up and ordered a topping only soup. I got the wonton and fishball soup for $6. It comes with 3 wontons and 4 \"fishballs\". I waited about 4 minutes longer for my bowl than my friend, who got her wonton and fishball lo mein within the minute of ordering. 5 minutes is not a long wait, but relative to how fast they operate here, it was a bit of a surprise. We ordered two takeout dishes when I finally got my bowl, and we got those within the minute of ordering as well. SUPER FAST. 

I always enjoy the wontons here - I always recommend it as \"the best wonton place ever\".  The fishballs were not in the shape of actual balls; they look like fried fish paste. You can see the small green ground up veggies and feel some soft bones when you bite into it. It tasted okay, but I wasn't feeling it. I'll stick with the wontons from now on! The broth is pretty salty, but non-oily compared to many noodle soup places. 

Get your hot tea yoself. 1 styrofoam cup per customer though."}
{"text":"Best shrimp wonton in Toronto and GTA. The filling is filled with huge shrimps, and just shrimps. They don't fill half of it with veggies, or pork, or dough, it's just shrimp. 

Super cheap and quick service. You can be out of there in 15 minutes. 

You can also purcahse pre-made wonton to bring it home and cook it yourself. That's how you know the quality is good. 

They close pretty early compared to other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting this restaurant after not being here for at least 3-4 years and the quality of the shrimp wontons remain the same - huge and delicious! I came here on a weekday late afternoon and there were only 2 other tables. The service was super quick; they give you the menu as soon as you sit down, you order and then food is at the table in less than 5 minutes. 

I ordered the plain shrimp wontons in soup ($6 + tax) and it was really delicious. No egg noodles for me this time as I wasn't too hungry. The shrimp wontons are huge and had a lot of fillings in it. Definitely a two-biter for me. 

The place itself isn't very fancy, but it does have the local wonton restaurant feel that you get in Asia. Self-serve water/tea station at the back. 

I will definitely be back to try the fish balls!"}
{"text":"Do you like noodles....do you like jumbo shrimp balls....do you like a non salty broth...if you said YES this place is for YOU. Unfortunately I ate my soup so fast and I didn't get a picture... But oh man there are no shortage of noodles or balls. This place is a hole in the wall... Cash only ... Family owned place. It's in and out fast... Take out and no frills. They're closed on Wednesdays FYI."}
{"text":"I've been going here ever since I was 7, and the noodles have stayed just as good as I can remember.

My family's usual order is the wonton egg noodle soup + fish vermicelli soup. I really love how big the shrimp wontons are: they really don't skimp on the size.

The service here is extremely quick: after placing our orders, we usually receive them in less than 5 minutes. Tea and hot water are self-serve and you get the bill once you place your order.

Overall it's a spot without all the bells and whistles: menu is quite small and service is laissez-faire, but what they lack in variety, they make up for in terms of quality."}
{"text":"I use to come here in the 90's when I went to high school down the street.  I remember it being good, and recently tried it again.

long story short, I found a LONG piece of hair in my soup.  This wasn't just a small hair but more like a foot long piece of black hair.  I nearly puked.

I will never return!"}
{"text":"The wonton was full of shrimp like a size of ping pong ball , noodles was thin and cook perfectly to its crisp and chewy, soup base was clear with a perfect touch of taste , couldn't ask for more from a little restaurant like this , Thumb up"}
{"text":"Amazing wonton noodles. So good. So fast. So cheap. Eat it fast before the noodles get soggy and just order another bowl. 

One bowl of wonton is only $6 and will come out in just minutes. Comes with four huge wontons that have whole shrimps in them. XO sauce goes well it. They do have warning signs up on the walls about how spicy the sauce is, so you can't say you weren't warned."}
{"text":"Yummy not fancy.  Cheap and cheerful shrip wonton noodle soup (which you can get without noodles as well).  It's delicious - the wontons are all shrimp.  The soup is very hot, you need to let it cool off.  With tax for take out just over $5.50."}
{"text":"Extremely fast noodles with great wontons!!

The shrimp wonton is one of the best I've seen in Toronto.
Beef is very tendor. Greens come with oyster sauce which is a bit too salty, but overall very good combination of price, quality and speed.

Prepared in less than a minute, literally.
Price is cheap.

I like this place."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this noodle place for long time.  The quality is still the same!  Amazing wonton and egg noodle.  We ordered a side beef too, very tender.  Highly reco!"}
{"text":"Boss took our team out for lunch yesterday, and decide to visit one of our clients who own Jim Chai Kee at the West Beaver Creek CIBC/Yu Seafood plaza. This restaurant specializes in hearty bowls of wonton noodle soup. Though the menu is simple, you know you will be getting amazing quality. Food comes out super quick. Hot water/Tea is self-served at the back counter (limit one cup per customer), you can certainly refill.

Goodness. I ordered the shrimp wontons x fishballs with flat rice noodles, and it was SO delicious! The soup they used was very light and seemed quite healthy. Each jumbo wonton was packed with lots of fresh shrimps, and the fishball was also meaty and fresh. They also make their own hot sauce and XO sauce... you can purchase it for $10 per jar. I love how they have a caution notice on the wall saying that their hot sauce is VERY hot, please be careful lol.

This was my first time having legit wontons, and I'm in love. The price is all very reasonable, and it is the perfect spot to grab a quick lunch. You can also buy frozen wontons to take home as well. Definitely worth coming back."}
{"text":"The wontons are good and the noodles were fresh, but the price and quantity is soooo small compared to a year ago. The veggies were dry and expensive, this is an example of how a restaurant becomes popular and they try to rip you off due to their success"}
{"text":"Stopped here to eat 2x during my weekend trip in Toronto with my friends. It is soooooooooooooooooo good! There were at least 3 big shrimps in each wonton and that's it. Simple and perfect! The egg noodles were fresh and had the quality of any good wonton noodle shop in Hong Kong. I'd definately go back when I'm in the Toronto area again."}
{"text":"One of my go to lunch places.  Great food and busy at lunch times.  It tastes the same for 20 years and the menu is even the same."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and i decided to order the shrimp wonton soup. The soup itself was basic and came with 4 decent sized wontons, nice and hot. They also have a self serve tea section. 
Overall flavour was about a low 2.5/5.

The service was fast. Im talking about placing our order and within 1 min my soup was on the table!
But dont expect the serves to get u anything other than your food

Price was on point. Its a really good place to come to if u want some soup on budget. $5 for a big bowl with 4 shrimp wontons and a hand full of egg noodles. 

The only downside, which wont stop me from coming back, is when i asked for s bottle of water, they dont have any. You have to use water from the sink. I personally dont mind, but other people might."}
{"text":"Tried out this place Sunday evening but when my friend and I came in, they were already closing - the kitchen closes at 7:30 and the restaurant at 8. As a result, we were quite rushed and service was subpar. The one good thing the restaurant has going for it is its value. The chao mien with shrimp dumplings is a good portion and only $6. However, I'm not sure I'd come here again because the broth was REALLY bad. It had an acidic taste that left my teeth feeling weak (like the feeling you get after drinking coke). Something wasn't right and I can only wonder whether or not it's normally like that, given past reviewers' praise for the broth."}
{"text":"Excellent place to visit for a quick, authentic, simple, and cheap meal.

This restaurant has been around for many years, recently made some new posters to put on the wall, a colorful version of the menu! 

tea is self serve, and a minor selection to choose from, but the few that they offer is their specialty.

The wontons are huge, and soup base is excellent (even though I believe it used to taste better years ago) since there were management changes.

Definately a place to go to if you haven't tried!"}
{"text":"This place has been around forever! The owner here is the son of the one in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong won had a Michellin Star at one point and then in recent years have been on the recommended list. It's pretty solid.

What keeps me coming back (aside from the awesome wontons) is the value. 5 bucks you get a bowl of noodles and 4 massive wontons. Flavor is spot on as usual.

Tea is self-service. People talk a lot about the lack of service in this place but I'm not sure what they are expecting. This is a wonton place - it's like the equivalent of a street vendor. How do you want to be catered to? You are also eating a 5 dollar bowl of noodles...what are you expecting...

This place is also super fast. You get your food within 2 mins from ordering. I eat pretty fast so if I pushed it, I could sit down, order, eat, pay, all within 7 minutes (I've timed it before).

Awesome place if you are looking for some authentic Cantonese food."}
{"text":"I love the noodles here.  The broth is slightly bland but improves significantly in comparison to the one on Midland.  The noodles were fresh and there were 4 wontons in the bowl (for $6?!).  There are a few minor complaints: (1) they didn't take the intestine out of (2) they didn't have soy milk (3) they didn't have dumplings.

PS. The servers like to scream the order to the back where the kitchen is located, so don't be alarmed."}
{"text":"There's something to be said for choosing one thing to do in life, and doing it exceptionally well. 

Jim Chai Kee adheres to this philosophy. 

It's raison d'etre: wonton noodle soup. 

I know, I know...if your only experience with won tons and soup is the tepid dishwater slopped forth from your local Manchu Wok, you'll wonder why the fuss?

But if you're steeped in the greatest of brothy arts, you appreciate a good bowl, and you'll come to appreciate Jim Chai Kee for the Souperstar it really is. 

Full disclosure: like many noodle-in-soup joints, the ambiance is somewhat lacking. But then, if you're planning on taking a first date for a big bowl of slurpy noodles your game plan needs work. Better to build rapport and a sense of trust...then get to slurping. 

Even still, decor won't win any awards unless you have a thing for hospital cafeterias. 

Fuller disclosure: wait staff are rude. I've written about varying degrees of unpleasant service here before. At Jim Chai Kee, you just don't exist. You are a body at a table and you get what they bring you...and since there's only about four menu items, chances are they'll bring the right food. Want water? Or tea? Get it your damn self. Seriously. Samovars and pitchers are set up for you to help yourself. Which is actually pretty convenient, if you think about it. 

Fullest disclosure: I am advised that this is actually the Canadian location for an international chain. I'm not sure if this is true, and I'm generally inclined to be harder on chains because I'm not part of the 1%, even if I don't always wanted to eat at yurt. 

So why does Jim Chai Kee rate four stars? Because. Soup. Is. Good. 

The broth itself is rich and golden; improving on the current, ridiculous \"bone broth\" trend by adding copious amounts of David Chang's favourite ingredient: MSG. I used to be one of those people who took issue with MSG for health reasons. Now? Screw it. Delicious. Soup. The best broths all have a bit of viscosity; it comes with the breakdown of collagen in whatever meat and bones you boil to make it. Jim Chai Kee's soup passes the test. 

What do they put in your soup? Here are your choices? Want something else? Go to Mandarin:
1) golf-ball-sized wontons bursting with fresh sghrimp cooked just to briny crunchiness. 
2) beef in oyster sauce. Tender. Slighlty chewy. Great textural addition. 
3) fish balls. As a lifelong gefilte fish afficionado, I've never known what to make of this style of fish-ball. Vaguely fishy; compressed to homogeneity, contributing more firm texture than any kind of taste...but then who am I to argue with the world's largest economy. 
4) springy yellow wheat-and-egg noodles in massive quantities. 
5) on the side, Chinese greens. Again, I know...but the bitter crunch provides excellent contrast. 

Wanna fancy up your bowl? There's soya sauce and pungent chilis-in-oil and hoisin on the counter. I recommend chilis-in-oil on everything. Even on my post-meal Cream Egg McFlurry, so I guess I'm biased. 

Eat. Pay. Leave. If you're lucky, after sitting a few minutes you'll be sent off with a cheery \"GET OUT!!!!\" 

Four stars."}

If you are looking for a typical HK style noodle shop, this is your place in the Toronto area. The noodles had the best alkaline taste I have tasted outside of Sheung Wan. The wontons were also bigger than any place in HK. I would definitely come back to eat here the next time I am in Toronto. The food is really good and the prices are outstanding."}
{"text":"Lunch feb 21 2016 ordered a wonton and dace fish ball noodle. I noticed the size of the wonton and fish ball have shrunk compared to my last visit a month ago. I think it may be due to high cost of food recently. Will try again another time to see if this was a one off."}
{"text":"CHEAP. FAST. WONTON. NOODLES!!!!

This is THE place to go if you are craving wontons, yet don't want to pay a fancy amount. The services are extremely fast, as if your order comes in a blink of an eye. They don't have much selections but you don't need other selections when you have wontons that are the size of a baby's fist. Each wonton has an equal amount of shrimp and pork ratio. The shrimps are not mushy, still have that crisp when you first bite into it. 

Hot tea/ water are self-serve. Don't be afraid to share a table with strangers!

It's quite hard to find parking during lunch time, therefore, if you are working in nearby buildings (like me), then it is best to just walk to the restaurant."}
{"text":"There are times you wonder how our taste buds can be so different?  This wonton noodle house is priced for a no frill quick bite, simple and fast.  What I cannot understand are the rave reviews?  Am I missing something or I stopped in on an off night (Thurs night)?  For me, a great wonton noodle bowl has rich tasting wontons w/ plenty of flavor, this place has decent size fillings but lacks the subtle flavoring.  Soup wise, it was weak, almost water like.  Price wise, it might seem inexpensive BUT if you use a typical Dim Sum dish like Sui Mai at a local special, then it isn't that cheap, just ok.  Sorry but I find the noodle bowls at some of the Congee places within Toronto GTA a much higher quality bowl."}
{"text":"If you are cravying for wonton with noodles. This is a place for you. The restaurant is small, have around 40 to 50 seats. They do offer takeout service and also sell premade wontons and other items. They close every Wednesdays. Wait times are usually minimal depending on the number of people and if you are willing to share your table with other people. Not a great place if you go in groups of more than 6 people. CASH ONLY payment. The ambience is very casual. 

Menu - small selection, you either get beef, minced fish ball, wonton, or any of the combinations, you have choices of noodles. You can add veggie dish with oyster sauce. Water and tea are self served at the back of the restaurant. Other drinks like pop are extra, which will be brought to your table once order is placed. 

Customer Service - very fast, the food comes within 5 minutes after you order if not less. And you pay at the cashier. I wouldn't say this place is friendly but it isn't unfriendly. It is average. If you want a fast lunch or just something quick, this is a good place to go.  

Taste - I have ordered all three types of meat with either egg noodle or vermicelli and never a let down. Good portions and value. 

Authenticity - definitely authentic with good value. 

Overall great place for a quick economical meal."}
{"text":"Love the wonton noodle soup. 

Heart warming food. Food is delicious and quick. In and out in 20 minutes.

Very normal decor, but that's what makes it feel homey and down to earth. 

Tea is self-served."}
{"text":"I would give 4 or 5 stars if I was exceptionally well-versed in wonton noodle soup. Since I'm not, I am not going to fall for the pressure to praise Jim Chai Kee simply because it's HK flagship received Michelin star approval. 

The first day of summer and quite the hottest day we've had in June this year, we came to Jim Chai Kee for a late lunch ordering B1 and A1 off their menu: a little bit of everything (wontons, fish balls, veggies, tenderized beef) in a bowl of noodles and as a lo mein dish.

Very lovely shrimp meat colours when I bit into the wonton, and fish balls were handmade and huge. Meats were tenderized with...meat tenderizer...so I don't really have many comments about the beef. It's not a plus or a minus. Noodles were great, because they were a cut above the usual fare.

Unfortunately, the hottest day of the summer was also a discomfort in the restaurant because they have a wall made from partially skylit windows and floor to ceiling windows, and the front of the shop was feng shui-ed with a ton of plants...essentially it was like sitting in a greenhouse at the table we were at.

Because the store's layout had no nook or cranny space where people outside pour in and stand and wait (not even a small partition), it is very uncomfortable to sit close to the door.  They also have high turnover of customers filing in and out: this can feel like a flurry of disruptive people walking back and forth.  I wish a restaurant like this with high volume of clients would consider investing a bit more in overhead and possibly make the space more navigable, or somehow expand the space a bit more to help the flow and seating plan.

Obviously, cheap food usually comes in a cheap space with mediocre service. Ain't the Ritz and we don't expect the Ritz. Food is great, seating was not, not a wonton conoisseur. Ergo, 3 stars."}
{"text":"Size is shrinking after their 2nd store opening while prices remain the same. Service still inconsistent from rude to here you go.  I will need to find myself a new noodle house in RH."}
{"text":"This is for sure if you want a quick fast lunch!

I usually order the same thing.. the wonton and beef with rice noodle. 

This is a good place if you don't want to look at pages and pages of menu in order to decide what you want to eat. Since they only serves wonton/ fish ball/ beef, with rice noodles/noodles/vermicelli or no noodle. in soup or no soup with oyster sauce.

The wontons are big with all shrimps no fillings... so if you loves shrimps you will enjoy that!! 

I love the hot chilly sauce a lot though!! I think I am here to eat the chilli sauce instead of the wonton...

A word of warning, if you come during busy lunch hour that is weekdays and weekends, you will have problem to find parking! and you will has to share table with others when it is busy. (And you never know you are sharing a table with me!!)

BTW, don't even think about lingering for a little R&R after you finished eating. Your bill is placed on your table right after you order and you has to go and pay at the cashier...and the efficient wait staffs would has cleaned out your bowels and plates the minute you finished eating!"}
{"text":"Their signature Won ton and Lao Meim are super yummy. Don't forget to order one plate of vegetable. Good price and yummy"}
{"text":"Taste is mediocre depends if you prefer quality or quantity food. If you like quantity over quality, you will like their wonton."}
{"text":"Price 5/5 - $5.10 for one meal

Location 4/5 - on the intersection and free parking

Food 4/5 - great Chinese noodle soups. enough for 1 big person

Service 4/5 - no complains. no cards, cash only

Will be Back!"}
{"text":"Agreed w/ Valery C- Jim's is a place that had got their specialties down pat. There's not a huge variety at ALL of food, but what they do have, is delicious!

Would come back again.

Pros
- shrimp wontons are huge and delicious
- soup and noodles do not have the \"soap\" taste; haha, this sounds weird, but it's a Chinese thing. Sometimes when you eat wonton noodles, there's a taste that we say in Cantonese called \"soap taste\" which is a bad thing, and this place does not have it!
- fast & efficient service - you order, and you get your food almost immediately
- the chili oil sauce is *delicious*

Cons 
- no variety; but that's the charm of the place

What they do have and just variations of the type of noodle or combination of \"toppings\":
- shrimp wonton
- beef balls
- fish balls"}
{"text":"In a rush? This is your place for quick and tasty wonton!

I've been coming here for years as the wonton is so delicious, massive (lots of shrimp!) and very reasonably priced. 

Their wontons are clearly their specialty however you can opt for beef balls, fish balls, etc. You can also choose to have egg noodles, vermicelli, rice noodles with your soup or none at all! 

It gets very busy around lunch time so sometimes they ask if you mind sharing a table to accommodate all guests.

Tea and water is also self-served at the back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and wasn't disappointed. The shrimp wontons were huge and delicious. The noodles and broth taste great. The parents wondered whether the noodles were hand-made, since they taste less crunchy than the ones they've had in NYC. Service was fast (water is self-service), price was cheap for what you get.

From what I hear, their other location in Hong Kong is extremely popular."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Always fast and food is good. Their wonton is always fresh and juicy. This place is better than the one at Midland. Must go for anyone who wants to try authentic HK wonton."}
{"text":"This is right across from my work and perfect for when you're craving something warm and soupy, all for a great price! The flavouring of the soup/wonton/extra toppings go wonderfully together.

I usually get take out and the staff are friendly in taking my order and service is quick."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap wonton egg noodles. Staff was very friendly and service was super fast.
The wontons were huge with big shrimps inside. Egg noodles was nice and thin. Soup was flavourful.
Best 5 bucks ever spent, definitely will come back"}
{"text":"For years I go to this small restaurant that serves only wonton soup with or without noodles. The menu is short and simple. Typically I order wonton noodle soup and veggie plate. You can also buy fresh raw wontons if you prefer to cook a couple at home. $14 for a dozen you can freeze. I like their big wontons loaded with sliced shrimps. My only complaint is the broth. They used to have very good tasty broth. Now it taste more like powdered wonton broth. There's also discrepancies in prices if you ask for order of extra noodles. Everyone seems to be in defensive mode when I asked for extra noodles. The menu says $2 for extra noodles but I was told I must order it ahead of time together with my order not after I ate my food. Otherwise, it is $3. What in the world is this stupidity!  Why can't you order it after?  I still have soup and I feel I still want more noodles. Anyway, I think this is stupid!  I said forget it!  This place seems to be going down in quality."}
{"text":"Overall not a fan of wonton soup.. but these wontons are HUGE. Every bit is a chunk of shrimp. It was very nice of the waiter to give me extra wontons because i was sharing with my husband ( we ate every 4 hours around the clock). 

Must bring home a bottle of the hot chili homemade sauce!"}
{"text":"Every time my family visits Canada for vacation we MUST ALWAYS COME HERE.  It's a given, no argument.  We stumbled upon this place by accident years ago and it is a gem.  It's a simple place and they have the best wonton noodles ever!  Self serve tea in the back.  We did notice the wontons have gotten smaller over the years but the quality is still there.  Will continue coming here whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Love the cheap wonton noodles here! Service is quick and efficient (but still relatively friendly), so it's the perfect for a quick lunch! I also tried the mixed noodles (w/ oyster sauce) and that was also really delicious. Portion size was just right for me."}
{"text":"Perfect example of a place that survives on the strength of a very specific item.  This was my one wonton noodle excursion this trip to Toronto, a non-descript place located in Jubilee Square, with two rows of small, round tables, register up front and hot tea available for self-serve from the back.

You take your pick of 3 toppings (shrimp wonton, fish balls, sliced beef), noodles (egg, rice, vermicelli), and having it in soup or soup on the side (lo mein).

I ordered shrimp wonton and sliced beef over traditional egg noodles in soup.  Served pronto, it comes in a medium sized bowl, noodles and ping pong sized wontons popping out of the soup.  The sliced beef, still rare, sit on the bottom.  The gigantic wontons are filled with multiple perfectly cooked shrimps, the noodles have just the right taste and bite, the beef is very tender and a surprisingly good inclusion, and the soup is light, with a nice flavor.  I do note I prefer wontons with a shrimp AND meat filling, but this is one of the best shrimp-only wontons I've had.  Had a dish of plain, blanched greens to go with the meal, well-prepared, perfect together.

In sum, a perfect wonton noodle soup.  Highly recommended as a quick stop to get that wonton noodle fix.  Super cheap too."}
{"text":"I knew i had to come back for these wontons after someone got me takeout a week ago from the scarborough location. I was in a rush to go to work but was craving wontons so me and the bf rushed over to grab a bite. I knew the service would be fairly quick but 1 minute after sitting and ordering the food came out in a minute! Literally. We ordered 2 bowls of just wontons and a wonton mein cause 4 wontons just isn't enough! Loved the chill oil and didn't find it too spicy at first but it caught up to me halfway through. My lips were burning but that didnt stop me from eating more. So spicy but so good. Definitely will be coming back very soon. Before going here my to go place was wonton time at market village which is very close to my house but JCK is close to my bf's house so now we don't have to go out of our way anymore just for wontons! 

Inexpensive, delicious and quick service. Im sold."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wonton and soup base! Their wontons are huge and delicious!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I think about that cheesy car boosting film - Gone in 60 seconds.  Really don't know why but the experience is so quick!
There is usually a seat when you walk into JCK.  It's not because they are not busy, it's because they have such a high turn over rate on tables.  Be prepared to \"share tables\" with people.  You meet all sorts that way...haven't met a fellow Yelp-Head this way yet!
The menu is simple.  Real simple.  You get to choose your proteins (Shrimp Wonton, Beef, Fish Balls) and the noodles (rice, vermicelli, egg...) and that's it unless you want some steam veggies too.  The broth is a simple clear salty broth with I'm assuming a decent amount of MSG.
It's 5 bucks for the noodle in soup, $6 if you get a combo of protiens, or $7 if you get all three.  I broke the bank (the big spender that I am!) and got the triple crown with the veggies ($2.50).  It's a buck more if you get noodle with soup.  Never quite got the whole attraction for that way of eating.
So...you sit, you order, you get food, slurp it up, and your out...really!  By the time you go and get yourself a cup of self serve tea and sit, your order is on the way.  Serving time is a few minutes max - quite the quick serve business model.  OK food and a price you really can't beat with service at the speed of light.  

Get and Gone in 60seconds-ish!
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place. Food came very fast and was delicious. Staff don't give a f*ck about you (not surprised) only thing- there was an eyelash in my soup that I'm pretty sure was not mine. Gross."}
